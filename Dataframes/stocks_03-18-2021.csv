03/18/2021,stocks,"Well right now it’s at $653 a share and has a market cap of $626 billion. 

AMD has a market cap of 97 billion. 

Ford has a market cap of 49 billion 

Intel has a market cap of 258 billion 

Do you think Tesla right now is worth more than 7 AMDs? What about 4 Intels? What about 13 Fords?"
03/18/2021,stocks,As long as it keeps going up the markets will stay shaky like this. Just make sure you have strong stocks and average down cause in the long run you should be fine
03/18/2021,stocks,"Rundown I heard on Marketplace (NPR show) today:

The yield rising the way it did indicates differently than what JPow said about inflation. If the Fed chair was wrong, then does that mean the Fed has control over the inflation situation like they’re supposed to? If not, will they be able to do anything about it if it goes up or moves unexpectedly? Uncertainty = bad = get my money out of the markets to somewhere safer. 

That was more or less the gist. Not saying how much I agree or not, but I hadn’t thought about it in those terms."

03/18/2021,stocks,Current market cap is around 10 billion right now with share price close to $27. Revenue for 2020 230 million. Trading at 40x revenue currently and projected growth over next 2 years certainly doesn’t justify a $60 Share price
03/18/2021,stocks,Nice DD thanks! Been watching this all week you think it'll drop further?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Over the next two years, yes, you're correct. I was thinking a few more years out - I probably should have worded that better in my post. Thanks for the feedback."
03/18/2021,stocks,"They just announced an underwritten public offering of 32 million shares yesterday, so I am assuming it will drop a bit more, yes. Shareholders tend to not vibe with dilution, but the capital that will raise will help the stock to raise long-term."
03/18/2021,stocks,All 4 are great. Can never go wrong with Microsoft and Apple. AMD should benefit from many new trends as everything will need a semiconductor in the future.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Definitely good stocks to invest in. Walmart is WMT, but I’d recommend them imo! 
Good luck!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I’m a $MSFT share holder, it’s a pretty safe stock. They’ve been shifting from legacy products to more cloud based services from Azure. They have a ton of cash in the bank, I invested before earnings this year and I’m up a good amount and got paid dividends too. 

Before I invested in Stock directly I did index’s and etfs too. 

If you’re going to buy stock yourself, it’s always good to balance out your portfolio between the sectors. Since unlike a ETF/Index it’s not already done for you but that’s part of the fun! 

I’m looking at buying some Healthcare/Pharmaceutical/Financial stock this year to balance out my portfolio. Have a look at $JNJ it’s pretty reliable.

Edit: Also, good luck!"
03/18/2021,stocks,All good picks for long term.
03/18/2021,stocks,"If you like them, take a look at VOOG (vanguard S&P 500 growth). 

Top 30% is comprised on AAPL, MSFT and AMZN. Take a look at holdings - will have you top names that you are considering Plus it gives you some cushion/diversification.  In case ETFs are your thing."
03/18/2021,stocks,XLK is is 40% MSFT and AAPL

03/18/2021,stocks,"Maybe, before June. It was around 150 before the pandemic. Also March 2020 it went down to $79"
03/18/2021,stocks,Chevron (cvx) and ExxonMobil (xom). Etfs are cool. Give diversification like a mutual fund but none of the  sometimes Nnoying terms of one since they trade like a stock.
03/18/2021,stocks,Which Oil company’s if you don’t mind me asking?  What do you think about oil ETF
03/18/2021,stocks,Got in OXY what do you think of XOP eft
03/18/2021,stocks,"I invested in GAP in September because retail stocks were being priced to bankruptcy kind of. And there were a few i considered but the Kanye deal is the catalyst i wanted. Now we are a bit farther from the price point i got in at, but if you have followed Kanye at all over his career, the man cannot be stopped. People laughed at him when he wanted to get into fashion and shoes. I know he will be a beast for this company. However you still need to do your research and determine GAPS value. I saw some price targets at 40. Its hard to say because they have athletica and old navy too. Im holding maybe add more if theres a crash here"
03/18/2021,stocks,I don’t know man. GAP was around $11 when that announcement was made. I wouldn’t buy it @30 personally.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm a huge fan of Kanye, so yes I know exactly what you mean. 'Just stick to producing, you can't rap'... 'just stick to rapping, you can't do fashion'... 'just stick to music and fashion, you can't do XYZ.' He does what he wants, and successfully. 

I will do as much research as possible. I saw a few forum posts on Yahoo from a little under a year ago talking about this when the price was around $10. God, to have invested then haha. I truly think this YzyGap deal will blow all expectations. Imagine if every hypebeast kid could have bought the $220 shoes, they'd be literally everywhere. Well this is that. You'll see this collaboration's clothes everywhere. I don't know much about trading but I predict the price will go higher than most people reckon, simply because most just aren't aware of Kanye's commercial power. 

With Gap at \~$30 stock atm, I would still like to reap the 33% increase to $40, potentially even higher. Since the announcement that it will be dropped in July, I don't see a major drop in price before the release since investors can now see the light at the end of the tunnel, instead of it being a vague idea for the future. Idk. I'm new to this, maybe my usual logic doesn't apply here. Do you suggest I invest now? Or wait for a crash like you said?

Thanks"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm quite annoyed I started my investing journey now and not earlier, though I wouldn't be surprised if everyone said that. Yes, I missed the opportunity to invest at $11, but I will still make a profit investing now at \~$30, surely? Wouldn't the price significantly increase the closer we get to the release? I'm just not sure the best way to it. I'm starting with smaller funds for now until I get more comfortable with trading, but because I'm almost entirely sure this will be quite profitable, I want to throw as much money as possible at it haha. Is that a stupid idea? Obviously, I don't mean all my money, I'm still responsible.

Thanks."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah i got in at 14 i think so its been a pretty good ride. I dont recommend basing your decisions on trying to time the market. Do your research and determine what you think the company is worth, including future cash flows and then decide to buy it or not. I wouldn't wait on a crash but you can always average down if it does. Once again depends how your valuing GAP and that determines if you buy now or maybe just put it on a watchlist. Kanye deal is a long one so no rush necessarily. But also gap should profit from back to school season if vaccines are rolled out the way they are being advertised"
03/18/2021,stocks,Why would the price increase the closer to release we get? The news has already affected the price and it’s picked this point to level out at. If anything there’s a ton of pressure on them to now perform extremely well and if they miss it by even a sliver that mean it’ll start to crash.
03/18/2021,stocks,It's not Canadian but I'm long TMV and it's been pretty good for me
03/18/2021,stocks,Amazing company doing great things! What more do you want? I’m in!
03/18/2021,stocks,"If you're looking at long-term investing, one very good strategy is to just buy a broad-market ETF like VT, and sit back and relax.   

It's very hard to pick individual stocks and turn that into a long term strategy.   You never know whether an individual stock is going to go up or go down.   By buying an ETF you can buy hundreds, or in the case of VT thousands of stocks all at once.    

A good site to explain how this works is at [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting\_started](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started) which is a community wiki about long-term investing using index funds.

This is not to say that it isn't fun to pick a stock and see how they do.   It's just that if you're in this for the long term, it makes more sense to put the lions share of your investments in a broad-market index fund."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You have to do the search and find your favorites, but I like to scan using finviz with the basic parameters below.

Price:  $1-10 per share

Average daily volume: > 1m shares or 1000x trading size.

High recent relative volume.   If normal volume is 1m then 4-10m is a great thing that shows interest.

Float:  ~100m shares, or even lower for more volatility, higher for less volatility.

Short interest / Float:  >0% / <15%.   Shows significant interest in the stock from short sellers or day traders.  Can sometimes squeeze, but too much short interest is usually a bad sign.

Stocks with major events on the horizon, or some other reason to move.   Get out before the event or news.

It’s also good to find the stocks that took a serious dive due to some bad news, and research what the news was and how long it should impact the stock, then set alerts for the future to check back on it."
03/18/2021,stocks,I can counter that argument that a stock that’s heavily shorted is a bad sign and I have an example. Corsair is a stock that’s a leader in its sector and it’s about 20$-30$ off of its fair value. Sometimes too much short interest on a stock with one of the fastest growing sectors in the world makes 0 sense. Besides some stocks that are over shorted are also a chance for fantastic short term play.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Curious, why get out before the event or news? Shouldn't you wait for it to peak after the news, and sell a portion?"
03/18/2021,stocks,the finviz search described by you requires a subscription
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah CRSR seems to be a rule breaker in that regard.   It’s just my general method to find candidates to research more.   

However I do find that even healthy stocks with high short interest tend to move erratically and be harder to predict.   I assume algos are to blame but regardless I prefer to avoid them."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Your call, I have better luck trading out before the news breaks in most cases.    It’s a coin toss of whether it will tank or pop, but the anticipation seems to be a sure thing."
03/18/2021,stocks,"It’s okay to subscribe, the world will keep spinning, and you’ll have access to an excellent tool."
03/18/2021,stocks,That’s interesting honestly. I do understand the short interest part because you seem like a long hold type. You don’t want the stock getting way ahead of itself and that type of growth is unhealthy. I understand all of it.

03/18/2021,stocks,"On the transfer fee, the broker you are going to usually will not charge a fee since they are getting a new client.  However, the broker you are transferring out of will likely charge an account closing fee."
03/18/2021,stocks,"There is no buying/selling that happens. Your shares are just moved.

The only issue I've seen people come across is an increased transfer time period if they're trying to move options or partial shares. If you're just moving regular shares, it should take less than a week. I recommend calling Fidelity and asking all questions before initiating the transfer. It's better to know what you're getting yourself into before you dive in.

There's a $75 transfer fee through ACAT. It has nothing to do with which broker, it's just the standard price across the board for transfer. 

edit: Fidelity customer service: 1 (800) 343-3548 they seem to have been extremely helpful to people with similar questions."
03/18/2021,stocks,"For your first question. Yes. They will transfer your exact number of shares at you average price (cost basis per share) I manually filled in my cost basis per share, was just faster for me. Think it takes a little longer for that information to be added after your TOA is completed. 

Your second question. Correct, partial shares cannot be transferred. And yes, Fidelity allows for partial shares to be traded. 

Your third question. There are no commission fees for trading on Fidelity. No monthly fees or minimums that I am aware of (I’ve been with Fidelity for about a month, did the same thing you’re doing)

Fourth question. Correct,  no crypto trading on Fidelity. I left my crypto in RH as well. Transferring your stock and leaving your crypto in RH will fall under a partial transfer. So make sure to not include crypto and have at least $75 in your RH account to cover the cost. (If you have over $25k Fidelity may cover the cost of transferring.... if you go online and use their virtual assistant, just type “agent” and you can get a hold of someone that way to see if they’ll cover the transfer fee)

It took me a couple weeks to adapt to Fidelity’s UI (some people say it is outdated). I miss the status graph that RH offers, but the information available to you as a Fidelity member outshines anything RH had. I have grown to like Fidelity very much over the last few weeks, plus they offer IRAs, 401k rollovers, retirement planning... it’s light years ahead of anything RH could do."
03/18/2021,stocks,From my experience you got it right. I'm still waiting for fidelity to update my cost basis. Transfer went through on 3/5 and they said it can take 15 days.

03/18/2021,stocks,"I also have a question:

Why were TDOC's general & administrative expenses so high in the last quarter of 2020?

I read that they were caused by the acquisition of InTouch and Livongo, but I don't really understand how 2 acquisitions lead to $300m additional costs."
03/18/2021,stocks,Ok thanks for the heads up. I'm constantly learning so I appreciate it!
03/18/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/18/2021,stocks,"I read your reply and the report, but I still don't understand how those acquisition lead to about $300m additional costs. It just seems like a crazy high number."
03/18/2021,stocks,oil is the only sector that is undervalued it seems. People doing ESG investing have made this sector undervalued.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I would hope any money hungry business men would be more willing to keep supplies low at this point to please any major investor with good returns but also its not that easy because they’ll try and sell more productat these prices while im sure the next country or company is also doing it secretly. I have a position in oil but im kinda of on the rocks now hearing that everyone and their mother wants to start pumping more, so that would drag prices down and we’re not even at pre pandemic demand yet so that has me a worried about short term maybe long term depending how fast they can get those reserves filled and stocked to the tits.

 Sure demand is rising slowly people in the U.S are traveling, but its not not how we expected with the flood gates opening full of people and their luggage in hand wanting to board a plane."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Mmm oil for anything long I think is pretty dangerous at the moment. If anything should happen to the markets, a crash of any kind (another round of pandemic or whatever), I don't think oil company will ever really recover. So it's still a good industry, but quite risky in the long term IMO"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Definitely, theres a lot of shorting being done looking at Fintel reports"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I think most of the big players are good investments in volatile markets. Covid burned through a ton of their cash but they just increased their market share. It really killed the cash poor smaller oil companies. Exxon, chevron, and the others are still sitting on tons of cash.

All of them increased their cash on hand because they didn’t put major money into future projects during the pandemic. It’s going to cause supply to crash in a year or two as the oldest wells are no longer being replaced by new wells. Supply crunches cause oil prices to go up and increase profits."
03/18/2021,stocks,"not to mention, how long do you trust the saudi's and putin to play nice and continue to rig the system? I wouldnt want my money riding on them being cooperative. the moment one perceives they have the edge, they're blow that agreement to high hell."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Ugh, I don't like it when people panic like that. It's like if people see a slight drop, they sell all their shit and ruin it for everyone else."

03/18/2021,stocks,Yields go up .1 and the nasdaq goes down 3%. Disproportional every time. If the yields went down .1 it wouldn't be a bull run.
03/18/2021,stocks,"People are entitled to feel any feeling they want, but he has a point. 

Look at any ticker anywhere for anything. it is always speckled red and green. markets always go up and down. you just can't get that worked up about one day. One day does not make a trend. It isn't good for your overall mental health to get that stressed out. 

More over, getting that stressed out can lead to stupid impulse moves and panic sells, which can magnify your problems."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Eh, /u/Homiz88 has a point. You don't invest with emotion. Down days are going to happen, there is no avoiding it. Last week this time I was down 40%, I didn't freak out or panic sell, it rebounded and now I am up 15%.

03/18/2021,stocks,Why didn’t I think of this...
03/18/2021,stocks,"My advice is to find good businesses with stocks that are reasonably valued. I would start with Amazon. One of the best run businesses in the world, and every time you see a delivery van, you can think to yourself, “That guy works for me,” because he does. They also are the biggest player in cloud, another area that is growing like crazy. The stock hasn’t done much since a big run up last summer even though business is booming. I wouldn’t be suprised to see Amazon hit 5k a share in the next couple years and 10k a share in the next decade. It’s 10% of my portfolio and I’m thinking about adding to it, especially if the market as a whole goes in the tank."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You did, but in the wrong order"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I had just started investing right before the crash. 

At the bottom the market was down, I guess, like 60%. And people still thought it could go lower. I personally know people that sold in early 2009, just before the bottom. 

On the way up there was talk about v shaped recoveries and how it's not possible (which I've found to be a recurring theme). Basically the entire ride up, people were calling for corrections, having the big crash pretty fresh in their minds: 2010, 2013, 2015 - I remember this being a particularly strong sentiment in these years. 

As for myself. I did terribly. Jumping in and out of stocks on the way down. Then when we had a sharp recovery, I remember getting into short etfs. I didn't really find my footing till around 2011. 

It was a crazy time to be invested. I learned a lot of (thankfully cheap) lessons."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Hm, I remember the talk about there basically being a «credit squeeze». Security through «junk» loans got called out as the rotten shit they were. Resulting in credit drying up or getting expensive. Essentially nobody wanted to loan out to another enterprise, general distrust. I remember interest rates on house loans skyrocketet. If you owner a business, you probably had a bad time financially. Laying staff off or saving where you could, postponing new investments.

Stocks plummeted. Ah, the bargaigns you could do at the time....

In come the central banks across the world. Promising to fix things to keep interest low, so that no companies that shouldn’t have to fail would fail, and nobody would lose their house due to crazy interest. Printing money and taking over junk bonds, bailing out those «too big to fail».

Stock recovered in like 2-3 years. 

And, somehow...they just continued to keep the rates low the next 12 years. Trying to ease back just as covid hit. Or so they said. Always seemed to be another excuse to keep the interest low.

PS! By the way; I feel the markets are in higher levels of euphoria and crazy valuations now then in -07."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I suggest you watch a documentary called *Inside Job* (it's really good; narrated by Matt Damon) and maybe *The Big Short* too. One of my favorite movies.  
2008-2009 was caused by an all out free for all in the housing and financial markets. People were taking mortgages they couldn't afford, with literally no jobs and no assets, and sometimes even 2 or 3 mortgages. Those mortgages were bundled together and sold as AAA investments, along with derivatives and derivatives of derivatives of those investments. Then insurance companies sold insurance against those investments that anyone could buy. The whole thing was a house of cards.  
  
Anyways, my point is, we aren't living in 2008. Sure there are probably pockets of bubbles, but the broader market is stable at the moment. People are overreacting about inflation right now. We will see some inflation, but we haven't seen hyperinflation since the 70s. And the fed has learned a lot since then and since the GFC."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I didn't overthink it. It was a great time to be investing. I was lucky earning more money each month than I needed. I put all the extra in the market at low prices. McDonald's stock down over half in a recession, i'll buy. KO cut in half, gimme. AAPL at $18, gimme a lot of that. 

Prices are nowhere near that cheap now."
03/18/2021,stocks,Commenting because I want to remember to check back in on this. I was a senior in HS during the 08’ crash.
03/18/2021,stocks,“Bull markets climb on a wall of worry.”
03/18/2021,stocks,"I bought my house in 2011 as well.

This time is different because the 08 crash was caused by too much debt, which lead to high levels of defaults and bankruptcies causing the economy to stall. Those with money stopped speeding and started holding onto it out if fear of not knowing with the future will bring.

This time the economy only slowed down due to mandated shutdowns. But many businesses quickly adapted by going remote. Please note how the prices of homes has gone up an not down as it did in 08.

Once everything has been reopened I'm sure business will return to normal quickly because the economy is still strong and not weak like in 08."
03/18/2021,stocks,"The biggest difference between 2008 and now is how government responded

We bailed out banks and corporations and let average Joe take it in the chin and start all sort of anger that still going, in 2020 we send people checks , expanded unemployment, didn’t let foreclosure / eviction happen , Fed stepped up overnight no one was writing Fed chair letters about QE causing German style hyperinflation"

Accordingly: fuck em"
03/18/2021,stocks,Ended up living in my car in 2008. It was a toyota sedan. I got food from food banks and stole copper wiring and coils from AC units because metal prices were up.
03/18/2021,stocks,I remember the crash very well..it's where I learned A LOT! as for the recovery..I wasn't part of it as I had no idea what I was doing then..but 08 made me have zero emotions in whatever direction the market is going in...I only invest what i already considered lost and will keep cash on the sidelines in case of a correction/crash..easy to not be emotional when you follow that rule.
03/18/2021,stocks,This was the only stock market I was familiar with and was always quick to jump out of stocks as well. It took a while for me to understand the big picture. I didn't realize just how rare it was. It made me question everything that everyone was doing in the world of finance.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Your comment on the 12 years of low interest rates is what I'm reflecting on as well. They never did raise interest rates. They started to in 2018 and the market started to sell off at the end of 2018. A weak global economy was being discussed. 

Whenever the market throws a fit the fed steps in to take care of it. I believe this is the ""new norm"" and I don't see this expectation ever going away. At some point the fed will run out of ammo. It was looking that way during the Covid crash. Doesn't mean the market can't thrive on its own but it would change things a bit."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Well you wouldn't compare markets in 2007 and now, you would compare housing with the market now since the bubble was in housing and I agree it's crazier"
03/18/2021,stocks,Also two of my favorite movies! I agree with you. It was a completely different cause. I was mostly referring to the recovery sentiment. The same things were said then that are being said during the Covid recovery. Everyone was struggling to believe the market could recover the way that it did without consequences. The decade long quantative easing that followed still hasn't had any real consequences and maybe it never will.
03/18/2021,stocks,I can’t afford my 800 gme shares. Is that quantitative stonking?
03/18/2021,stocks,I was 6 chewing on a crayon that was in my friend's nose.
03/18/2021,stocks,So what would your advice be in the current situation?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah, that is true, the stock market just became collateral. Perhaps the bubble is in stocks this time, dragging the housing market down? Inclined to think both stocks and real estate have entered bubble levels to be honest."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I think a big difference now is that investors know that the government/fed will step in to prop up the market when things get bad. And now millennials are in a position to start investing, we have been conditioned to step in and start buying when we see a correction. The reason March 2020 recovered immediately is everyone swooped in and started buying like crazy."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I was in college trying to get into my general ed classes. Profs were being furloughed, classes heavily impacted and ridiculous waitlists. Students LYING about their need for the class because they were graduating seniors. It was only until next year that the Uni issued cards verifying that students are graduating seniors and should get priority enrollment on waitlisted classes. I remember running to 4 different classes, didn't get into any of them bc I was a sophomore. I ended up going to a community college at the same time to get the units I needed for full-time student status (for Obamacare). Shitty times, they were."

03/18/2021,stocks,calm down... it's been like 3 days since all time highs
03/18/2021,stocks,My guess is no. Bottom may hit at the end of March. Then hopefully April is a green month
03/18/2021,stocks,Probably not as far as tech goes. Many tech companies are still quite overvalued.
03/18/2021,stocks,Depends how the broader market holds up
03/18/2021,stocks,Yea it definitely feels to me like tomorrow is going to be a red day as well.
03/18/2021,stocks,Wouldn’t mind that at all. Took the bounce as an opportunity to lighten up and would love to redeploy my cash at even lower prices
03/18/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/18/2021,stocks,It would be wrong for me to give specific stock advice. Sorry and I hope that you can understand.
03/18/2021,stocks,You are trying to interpret things through a retail trading perspective and dont realize how much money is simply moving through algorithms and obligational trades.
03/18/2021,stocks,"It's not taking because of the jobs report it's tanking because of the 10 yr which is up 5% today. Also we don't affect the broader market how many time do people have to say this before we get the memo, retail dosen't cause dips like this at all."

03/18/2021,stocks,"If retail investors can affect the market, we should already be at the moon"
03/18/2021,stocks,">So people are selling because they think BECAUSE of bad news their stocks will go down and so consequently those same sellers are all driving the price down by selling! Makes a lot of sense! 

Are you suggesting that it is stupid to sell on bad news because if nobody sold the price would stay the same? Although technically true, good luck coordinating with the entire market. If people think the price is going to drop, there are always going to be sellers. 

&#x200B;

> Also what makes it really stupid is that when someone is selling because of bad news someone else is buying the same bad news! 

Why is this stupid? Of course a sale has to have a buyer, but prices don't drop from sales alone. You could just as easily reverse your comment and say that every buyer has to have a seller on the way up. So, by the same logic it would be stupid to sell on the way up. Ultimately, nobody knows which way it is going, so mistakes are only known in hindsight.

Prices don't fall from sales or purchases alone, they change when the pressure of one exceeds the other. If bad news comes out, nobody is going to want to buy at current prices, so naturally bids are going to fall. If anyone wants to sell, which they always will, the asking price will fall if there aren't enough buyers.

Similarly, the amount that a stock falls on bad news isn't just based on the willingness to sell, it is the willingness to buy. If people want to buy it at the current price, it won't fall. It falls because there are more people that want to sell than there are buyers at a current price."
03/18/2021,stocks,"there are rules in the markets, discipline is necessary and absolutely nothing is by accident."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I haven’t lost any money in stocks because I hold like god damn anchor. Maybe I’m stupid, maybe I’m patient. Point is I don’t need that money that I tied up in stocks. Still up 300% overall"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I would say keep in mind a lot of new investors came in from GME/AMC.

I know many people with RH accounts that do not even understand what causes a stock price to go up and down.

I would also say newer traders that see GME/AMC/etc. expect that these types of movements in the market are normal or have only been trading since March, where the market went on a huge uptrend."
03/18/2021,stocks,Correction:  Someone is buying at lower prices than someone else bought at just moments before.  That’s the trick with it - downward volume instead of up.  The seller must be willing to ask for less than earlier.

03/18/2021,stocks,So sell high buy low is dumb?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Not quite true. Hedge funds sell imaginary shares (synthetic longs) to make it look like others are selling.

Or they trade between hedge funds illegally to make it look like it’s sold off, as they have may have a short position on a stock, that then had a news catalyst they are trying to prevent rising as it would lose them money.

Or they went so short on one stock, they need to further short it to suppress interest via manipulating the market, and the only way might be via an ETF holding that stock ......and when they have to cover the shorted stock, they have to sell off another stable stock, within the ETF for liquidation. clever investors see this manipulation and buy those ‘down turn’ stocks, as they know it only went down due to manipulation.


 The stock market is fucked!"

03/18/2021,stocks,Who operates all of this?
03/18/2021,stocks,Oh ok.  So is that what's going on?  So the stock market is basically rigged?
03/18/2021,stocks,Yeah the bond market doesn’t believe a word the fed said yesterday.
03/18/2021,stocks,More precisely tech and speculative stocks whose profits are years in the future are being significantly affected by that rise.

03/18/2021,stocks,Ok cool.
03/18/2021,stocks,Thanks bud.  Just trying to understand
03/18/2021,stocks,"But then why do they buy back into the same thing the next day?  I don't get it is all I'm saying.

My point is that everyone sells cause everyone thinks everyone else will sell and so it's a self fullfilling prophecy."
03/18/2021,stocks,"A synthetic long is a position you achieve by buying an at the money call and selling an at the money put (should be more or less free). The value of this position increases and decreases with the stock, so it’s a direct exposure to the price of the underlying.

How do you think synthetic long drives down stock price? Through what mechanism?"
03/18/2021,stocks,Right!  That's why I think it's bs!  I say hold!  Tell them to f off!  The rich want more and more.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Oh I remember that day from last year!  What day is that every year?

03/18/2021,stocks,"Operates what? There are thousands of investment firms, hedge funds, various portfolio and money managers that have direct access to the official exchange seconds before any regular human being does and on top of that have a constant stream of level 2 data and advanced algorithms to automatically make their trades and ensure their macro and micro strategies are implemented. Everyone has different priorities and strategies, etc and they dont operate on the same principals as regular retail traders like us."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Those HFs they create program to auto sell and buy, to short and drive the price down to make money..."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Not really, what happens is that you are an insignificant player in a sea full of whales and sharks who operate without any regard to your ideas, wishes and wants.

Imagine that you are a little fish in a shoal  who moves more or less in tandem with your peers in the waters displaced by much larger creatures (whales, sharks etc.) who only care about you (if they even notice you at all) as roadkill or at most as occasional prey.

In the business they call retail investors ""noise traders"" and treat them as the butt of jokes. Tough to realize, I know."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Rigged in the sense that the more capital you own and control the more power you exert over the market, yes, retail cannot and will never be able to compete in that sense, its simply impossible from a pure math standpoint. Its not rigged in the sense that there are a couple people/companies making all the decisions to benefit themselves through manipulation. If that were true then no hedge fund would ever take a loss and the market is simply too big for any one private institution to influence it to the extent people think. Tech stocks get sold off first and the most because they are the most speculative in the market, so in times of volatility they are the riskiest, thats why you have seen such swings in big tech the past month or so and such little movement in things like financials that are constantly making profits every second of every day."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yup they found Powell very, very unconvincing"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Not exactly, this is why I'm slightly concerned, oil took a massive dump today which is absolutely not in line with the rotation Narrative."
03/18/2021,stocks,Yeah but they'll go back up watch.
03/18/2021,stocks,Investors who hold these bonds or decided to sell and but them
03/18/2021,stocks,It's not about the fact that retail is intentionally not allowed to have influence its that there is so much money in the market and retail only owns a small part that's not discrimination at all its just a numbers game.
03/18/2021,stocks,Right who is this guy talking about skiing here
03/18/2021,stocks,Some people BUY stocks when the market is red (thinking great deals)and some people SELL their stocks when the market is red(thinking fear of losing money)
03/18/2021,stocks,what's that got to do with anything?
03/18/2021,stocks,"actually no, there are signals to go long and there are signals to get out - the price action tells the whole story."
03/18/2021,stocks,"It's usually not the same players who buy and sell a given stock issue, so their motivations and reasoning differ."
03/18/2021,stocks,Exactly some people don't know that a synthetic long is a damn options combo and pretend like it is something super sinister like what???
03/18/2021,stocks,"I didn’t say they drove down stock, I’m saying this is a tactic MM use to cover their naked positions on shorted stock they never dreamed would rear its head.

03/18/2021,stocks,"I think in reality they found him very convincing - he has said over and over again they are not raising rates until unemployment hits their goals. When asked if he was concerned about bond rates rising, he said he was not. The bond market is believing what he is saying, and also believing that what he is proposing will ultimately lead to some inflation in the near future. The 10-year at 2% should not be a huge concern unless your portfolio is all speculation. These little pullbacks are healthy and wash out the excess."
03/18/2021,stocks,I could care less. To me it's all bs.  Watch how everything changes right back to rally mode in a week or two.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Oil took a dump because the prices tanked, the entire market is at the mercy of OPEC and what they decide at the next meeting, it has far more influence on things than treasury yields."
03/18/2021,stocks,That's likely only weakly connected to raising treasury yields through strengthening of the dollar. The oil market is currently affected by news from Europe and China which signal possible weaker demand. So it's mostly a coincidence of timing.
03/18/2021,stocks,So buying makes the yield go up or selling them?  I don't get it.  I thought the Treasury sets the yield?
03/18/2021,stocks,What do they buy after selling these bonds? Aren’t solid equities are safe harbor under inflation?
03/18/2021,stocks,Yeah I realize that.  Why does Cramer make it seem though like retail DOES move things?  Maybe to keep his show and all the retailers going?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Right.  Should I have bought today?  I'm thinking it's gonna tank a little more.  I got 20% cash.

I got SQ .  only 5% of portfolio.  I'm in at 185 cost basis.  Trying to average down.  So I'm hoping it falls more.  I could care less really.  In for 10 years from now."

03/18/2021,stocks,oh yes. a gamestonk post. very good.
03/18/2021,stocks,This kind of thing happens but it isn't usually what drives the market.
03/18/2021,stocks,So just buy and hold and have a 10 or 15 year horizon!
03/18/2021,stocks,If your time horizon is 20+ years then you'll be OK as long as you pick companies that will survive and thrive on such time scales. Or if you invest in indices/ETFs.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Not necessarily unless you really like the future of the company. Rotations are temporary, the market is just broadening out. Once the institutional money gets their fill with the other sectors they will come right back to tech. If anything now is the ideal time to start buying tech rather than chasing the stocks that have been running the past month."
03/18/2021,stocks,"That entirely depends on your specific investment needs. If you dont need the money for the next 5 years you can feel free to buy into speculative tech or high growth stocks and not think about it. If you have a family and cant afford the risk then you can go financials/utilities, etc. Everyone is different in how they manage their money depending on their needs."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Following the big players isn't all that advantageous since you are always one step behind them (and they of course know that). When the media starts talking about rotation into this and that it's already late since institutional investors have positioned themselves there a long time ago. 

That's why trend following is risky and in the long run you are better off pursuing some form of value investing. Momentum investing works well only during certain periods in strong bull markets."
03/18/2021,stocks,"And we were at 3% before the pandemic and the economy was doing just fine. 2% is nothing. But if the market wants to overreact every time it moves up a few bp, I'm perfectly happy to keep buying my ETFs at a discount."
03/18/2021,stocks,That isn't exactly true because if they believed him this bond sell-off would have  never happened.
03/18/2021,stocks,The problem is that no matter how many times he repeats something they just don't trust Powell period and tbh to a macro strategist he looks like a cold faced liar especially when he raised gdp expectations while also doubling down on not raising rates which is kinda contradictory.

03/18/2021,stocks,"The market chooses at what yield they are willing to buy 10 year treasuries (the yield is defined as the cupon divided by bond price, so lower bond price means increased yield).

The Fed doesn't buy long term treasuries (that would be yield curve control, which is practiced for example by Japan and Australia and in some ways also by the EU). The Fed's intervention is restricted to buying short term treasuries for now."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Buying makes the yield go down and price go up.  The treasury doesn't say ""we're selling a 1% bond today,"" they say we'll sell you a promise of $100 in 1 year.  The auction starts and goes up until no one else is willing to bid higher.  The ""yield"" is the growth from whatever that final sale price is, say $99."
03/18/2021,stocks,"It depends. Some stay in cash (including foreign currencies), others buy gold or silver or real estate trusts or international equities. They are not restricted to the US stock market.

Usually a portfolio manager has a mix of different kinds of assets and he rebalances periodically among them. What he is allowed to invest in is specified by the rules of the fund.

For example hedge funds are allowed to use complex long-short and derivatives strategies which are disallowed in retirement and ordinary mutual funds. So hedge funds take on more fat tail risks, which is why you can't invest in a hedge fund unless you are an accredited investor."

03/18/2021,stocks,"It's a good idea to buy only when you have a good reason to believe that you are buying at or below fair value. You can't have an estimate of fair value without using fundamental analysis, which requires quite a bit of work and a certain amount of knowledge of corporate finance as well as reading a company's SEC filings. Otherwise you are pretty much investing blindly."
03/18/2021,stocks,"accounting errors are more common than you think, and what impact did plug have exactly, you think plug's caused the market to be red today?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Buy and hold only makes sense if you bought at a good price. If you bought considerably above fair value then it will only produce moderate returns in the long run.

This is the major risk of momentum investing, which ignores intrinsic value and relies on the greater fool theory. When market conditions change, you simply won't find a greater fool willing to buy your shares at a price higher than what you paid for them. At least not in the short to medium term, so you risk being left to hold the bag, sometime for years."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Again you are tunnel visioning and only thinking of the market in terms of a single retail investor. Money managers cant just hold for 15 years, they have employees to pay, they have investors who are expecting a return and can demand their investments pulled at any time. They have to realize profits often in order to keep running, they cant just have thousands of people take IOUs, people have mortgages, insurance, rent, tuition, taxes, etc. Profits have to be realized and money has to be exchanged in order for anything to function. Thats why you see money being pulled and moved around."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm 60% tech which includes semis like LRCX avgo and ASML.  Hopefully I'll be ok in the long 🏃!  I got 20 to 25% cash.

I've been trying to average down in SQ and things cost basis 185.  I realize SQ is risky but I like it along with PYPL.  I just keep them under 5% .

Aapl is 8% portfolio and $91 cost basis.  Aapl and msft have been fairly solid in my portfolio.  Not that volatile.  They're 18% combined.  I'll have to eventually trim them I think."
03/18/2021,stocks,Ok.  Most of this money I don't need.  I also have a vanguard index account as extention of savings.

03/18/2021,stocks,I'm not.  I'm diversified and have 20% cash on sidelines at all times!
03/18/2021,stocks,So when yields go UP people are SELLING bonds?  I think I should go get a basic economics for dummies book seriously!  😆
03/18/2021,stocks,Thanks!

03/18/2021,stocks,As you age and get towards retirement that’s when you wind down your exposure to risky shit. You don’t want to be drawing from your investments during a deep downturn.

That's a reasonable strategy for most investors. The majority of money managers fail to beat index investing in the long run."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Yes and no. Indexing is a scientific method of reducing your risk based on admission of lack of knowledge, so you trade higher potential profits for lower risk based on first principles. Buying a company without any fundamental analysis is just noise trading.

There's an awful lot of academic literature about this including extensive studies of real market data and fund performance going back decades so this isn't just opinion.

It is extremely difficult to generate consistent long term returns above indexing (i.e. to generate alpha) by any method except fundamental analysis and arbitrage."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Apple is likely a good investment for the long run since it is a stable blue chip company which is *not* overvalued by any large margin (even though imo it is *somewhat* overvalued right now). So I wouldn't worry too much about holding Apple shares long term.

SQ is a much more speculative investment, but it would be wrong for me to advise you what to do about it."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Apple moved by $-4.23 today, you’re $29.53 below the market price, and you’re thinking of dumping?"
03/18/2021,stocks,That’s a really good price for SQ IMO - holding 4 a 225 and would love to trade :)
03/18/2021,stocks,"If you dont need the money for the next 10 years to survive or buy anything big then you will be fine, the issue is you need to expect these kinds of wild swings because thats the nature of the risk/reward calculation when it comes to these kinds of stocks, but you also need to understand when a market correction comes its going to affect your portfolio significantly more, look at what a 2-5% dip in the SPX did to tech stocks a couple weeks ago for example."
03/18/2021,stocks,Me too but I'm only SQ 4.5% portfolio basis 185.  Pypl also about the same.  I read somewhere though not to worry or try to average down?

03/18/2021,stocks,"Yes, but it seems in overweighting AAPL MSFT NVDA AVGO etc rather than put it all in my FSKAX Total Market fund I did do better than the market.

I got a 25% return in 2020.  I think the fskax did 15%.

Also the FSPTX tech fund I have has beat the market for 15 years.  It might not for the next 10 or may.  How can you tell?"
03/18/2021,stocks,Thanks.  I realize SQ is very speculative.  Thats why I keep it under 5%.
03/18/2021,stocks,No. What is the market price?  Is that the fair value price or whatever the market dictates at the particular time?
03/18/2021,stocks,Cool.  In another year maybe it'll be at 280.  Who knows?
03/18/2021,stocks,Yeah.  I'm down about 10%.  Doesn't worry me.  I lost more in March 2020.  Got it back plus.  I look at it as a sale!
03/18/2021,stocks,"I agree, the catalyst for this pullback doesn’t cause me to worry at all, nothing fundamentally about these companies have changed and there is no economic data that currently changes my thesis."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Past performance is not a guarantee of future returns. The market has exaggerated the potential of certain sectors (such as EVs and some tech companies), which is irrational (and was unintentionally made worse by the easy money policy of the Fed). 

That exaggeration was initiated by retail investors and then amplified by certain institutional investors who tried to take advantage of mass psychology using momentum investing techniques (notice that only certain institutional investors participated in this, while others kept away from it).

This is why we are seeing a correction.

So you benefited from a period of irrational exuberance in certain tech sectors (and from the unethical behavior of certain institutional investors), a period which is now coming to an end."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Market price is the volume-weighted average of the bid and ask price at any given time so it changes second to second. Fair value is an intrinsic estimate of what a company's share price should be based on fundamental analysis (this also changes but more slowly, based on the state of the company's business).

The principle of reversion to the mean implies that in the long run the market price will tend toward the fair value price. So ""in the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine"".

The reason why it works this way is that rational investors will try to arbitrage away any difference between the share price and the fair value price (since this is how they make money).

In this process the smart money are arbitrageurs and the dumb money are noise traders (since they generate irrational divergence between the market price and the fair price). Smart money may temporarily try to take advantage of mass psychology to make a quick profit (this is called momentum trading) but they know that it's just speculation on irrational mass psychology and they will try to dump on the dumb money when they think that the party is over."
03/18/2021,stocks,Between SQ and Paypal I feel like they are monopolizing the same space and both look like winners. But I'm mostly invested (25%) in SQ at this point - buying a share on each the 'dips'. Hodling 'till that 280 Moon!

03/18/2021,stocks,"Perhaps, but MS and AAPL are likely pretty good long term investments anyway. It's the more speculative tech issues that were overvalued by large margins."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Maybe, but you are in the market to make money isn't it ?

It's a zero sum game in the short term.

In the long term the only factor that generates return is the increase in productivity, which is based on science and technology. So you can invest ethically by using index funds and ETFs or following a buy and hold strategy based on fundamental analysis. In that case you largely contribute to markets becoming less noisy and more rational.

What we have seen from many retail investors recently is the opposite of that, namely confusing the stock market with a casino. Investing and gambling are not the same thing."
03/18/2021,stocks,lol  they are shaking in their boots!

Basically DCA your way into taking profits so you ensure some base level of satisfaction while maintaining some reward leftover."

03/18/2021,stocks,Ugh. Same. I was up 40% on TTCF calls but I figured I would sell in the morning. Next day plummets 20% and now I’m in a loss of 35%. Wish I had been more aggressive using my exit strategy
03/18/2021,stocks,"25-30% unless my conviction/research confidence level is high. Additionally my loss threshold is very conservative. 3-5% max. Capital conservation with an upside.

Best of luck, wishing you success in your trading."
03/18/2021,stocks,"That's so genius actually. I don't know why i never considered that. I had 6 calls for SPY that were crazy ITM before it tanked. Had i sold 3 of them when i was waiting for it to hit my target, I would've salvaged much more of my gains. 

That's definitely something I plan to practice from now on. I've always only sold my calls altogether, never really one offed them like that.

Thanks for the idea, i love it, and definitely will start implementing it!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Ya I realized I was at a 30% gain and tried to push it yo 35.. got a bit greedy which led me to wonder what percentage of gains people decide to sell.

I am not a cat either."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Hey no worries man, there's definitely a shit ton more of us out there who've done the same. Have to keep reminding ourselves that small gains are better than  no gains and much better than losses haha. That's why i always sell my stock before EOD because you never know what's going to happen overnight."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah the most important part is to make certain unquestionable decisions before the run or the calls are ITM, the second you start thinking ""well i didnt expect it to get here this fast, what if i-"" you will start letting your emotions and idealistic scenarios cloud your judgment. Remember to contextualize your profits as % gains too, if you think ""well i only made 200 bucks off this thats not much"" you are far more likely to make riskier choices than ""well i am up 100% on my initial stake, thats an insane ROI for a play"""

- increase geopolitical conflict between China and US

-China controls most of the worlds supply"
03/18/2021,stocks,0.05%? U serious?
03/18/2021,stocks,It also comes down to the fact that the stocks are exciting to read about. I really like these stocks because they are the only thing about the future I am optimistic about. Right now I'm trying to separate my feelings from the market and think a little about diversifying.

03/18/2021,stocks,Been buying since this sub was nonstop talking trash on them back when they were in the $47.00 share range and constantly praising AMD how much Intel was done for. They have a lot going for them when you really look into them.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Intel's issue isn't 100% product. 

They intentionally lie to consumers and can't adapt to an ever changing market (pricing).

They had a huge advantage over AMD, due to most MOBOs being Intel compatible. IMO, they should have lowered the price of their products to match AMD's, rather than paying people or manipulating benchmark environments. 

Due to all their lies, I wouldn't even believe a benchmark that performed on par with NVIDIA or AMD. I sure as hell won't be replacing my GPU with an Intel one, either."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I do agree, this is huge."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I have been big on Intel as a value pick up for a while. 

I think GPU is a huge opportunity if the cards can compare, particularly on price. Obviously AMD and NVIDIA dominate this market, but supply issues are creating a huge chance for a third product to be in the space. 

I think Gelsinger is the mind to course correct architecture issues. 

and lastly.... while you can't ignore their issues shrinking nodes, you have to admit nobody is riding the bleeding edge better. Intel is still putting out competitive chips on larger form factors and so far is simply hasn't hurt them. Intel completely and utterly dominates the full market. AMD has made major in roads, in particularly among PC builders and gamers. 

But over the counter PCs? BUSINESS PCs? Intel completely dominates. AMD is trying to crack this code, but I am not sure to what degree they will, there is just so much institutional dominance there, and intel has the leverage to maintain it. 

As an interesting, and possibly ironic counter point: I actually prefer AMD products in real life. I built my current PC AMD/Radeon. I just like Intel the stock better than AMD the stock, though with AMD cratering quite a bit, it is becoming more attractive."
03/18/2021,stocks,"intel should be losing ground, their cpu is pathetic."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm long both, but I'll be honest - holding AMD is a seriously painful experience."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yea, I agree. The valuation on INTC is just far too attractive at this point."
03/18/2021,stocks,Agreed
03/18/2021,stocks,"you grossly overestimate the degree to which the average consumer gives a shit about benchmarks. 

PC enthusiasts care. Gamers care. but like 80% of the CPU market doesn't care. they pick a computer somewhat randomly online or off the shelf at best buy, and they look at two names. Intel or AMD. they read Intel and in their mind they hear that little ""dun-dun-DUN-dun ding! Intel inside"" jiggle and buy intel because of name recognition. 

And business that buy in lots of 1,000s for their workforce? they sure as shit don't care. I have never in my life ever seen an AMD based corporate laptop. I am sure they exist, but I know my own state agency that life cycles over 10,000 laptops every 3 years or so will only ever buy Intel PCs. 

This name recognition absolutely WILL extend to the GPU market, in particularly if they can make a good budget priced card that is highly accessible to the masses. Price is a major bottle neck on builders."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I agree and actually just switched to an AMD on my personal build from many years of Intel builds. However,  INTC's valuation relative to AMD is just so much more attractive. Of course, this is perhaps warranted given the growth discrepancy but I think the forward growth on INTC is underappreciated. Given all the tailwinds and the lead time in production, I think those who have product will win regardless of whose product performs better on margin."
03/18/2021,stocks,"if a cpu is cheaper, and runs cooler, all business will eventually adapt to it.

what intel have is, legacy business already have intel computer. with all business, efficiency, speed, reliability are all very important factors"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I think you grossly over estimate how businesses care about brand loyalty.

Businesses are all about the bottom line and cost effectiveness.

Initially, I had your sentiment and when AMD was making a comeback, and I thought there is no way that they would replace business side computers. I completely neglected in my thinking that these companies don't have their IT people rip a part the computer and replace parts. Most companies I know of literally just buy them another prebuilt, and the IT people replace the tower. 

I know this may not seem like the most cost effective way, but to the people who make these decisions, it actually sort of is when have 20k+ employees at multiple sites and want to limit the size of your IT department. They can't all be working on building/replacing computer parts all day, even though most people would agree it is very simple."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I didn't say anything whatsoever about loyalty.

I invested in Qyld they give a 1 share ever month as a dividend payment. I also invested in Stellantis which is pretty underrated and it’s also a Jeep ev which has a solid prospect in the future, but I like it cause they also have a solid dividend yield."
03/18/2021,stocks,"> I just maxed my ROTH, and have been dabbling with individual stocks. 

I can’t tell if you’re throwing money at individual stocks in your Roth IRA so ima go ahead and say that probably isn’t a smart idea. Especially not with penny stocks. 

30% VTI
30% VOO
20% VXUS
20% INDIVIDUALS. (I love investing in penny stocks, but 40% of my green is in big companies. (Mindset: the money in pennies is lost money).

> What y’all think.. is it too diversified? 

1) No reason to own VTI and VOO. Pick one. 

2) No reason to own penny stocks in a Roth IRA. If you want to gamble with penny stocks (I say don’t touch them at all) do it in an individual taxable account. 

3) Imo I wouldn’t touch individual stocks in my Roth IRA. My Roth is for indexes only.

4) If you want to add more risk/reward throw in a small cap index fund like VB or IJR. Have it be about 20% or so. I’d do this over gambling with penny stocks."

03/18/2021,stocks,"> huge dividends

pun intended?"
03/18/2021,stocks,And zero reason not to
03/18/2021,stocks,What about a small amount of buying and selling speculative stocks in a Roth? It would take advantage of the no taxes!
03/18/2021,stocks,NLY for dividends.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I see dividends as like the company automatically cashing your investment out on a regular schedule.  Just doesn't seem that way because the total number of shares doesn't change.  Like you wanted to hold for at least a year to save on capital gains taxes, but the dividend shows up all ""Hey, me and some of the other nickels and dimes here decided we didn't want you to pay lower taxes on us, so we decided to come out of your investment early.  That cool?"""
03/18/2021,stocks,"I like that. How would you diversify with dividend investing?

40% Dividend Investing
30% VTI
30% VXUS?"
03/18/2021,stocks,Might as well spy and voo with that attitude. Don’t understand what you’re trying to say here.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I like to keep my portfolio as ""clean"" as possible. It would drive my brain bonkers to have to look at that every day haha."
03/18/2021,stocks,It’s a double edged sword. Use it wisely.
03/18/2021,stocks,"At 23 you do not want dividends. I, also 23, literally don’t buy any stocks that pay above a 1-2% dividend. At this age and risk tolerance you want GROWTH. Companies that give away all their retained earnings don’t have any interest in growing and should be off your radar."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Straight up REITs too, get the hefty reit dividend while not paying the tax because it's a roth!"
03/18/2021,stocks,As young as you are 50% 25% 25% wouldn't be a bad idea but make sure you combine value investing with the dividends and buy cheap undervalued dividend stocks like att at 28 or under and Ko around 45 if you can. Not financial advice.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Dividend investing is just snake oil. It’s easy to sell, but in reality is not good. 

The only metric you should measure your success with stocks is though asset appreciation. Look up dividend irrelevancy and thank me later."
03/18/2021,stocks,"A 6% dividend reinvested will earn you 79% over 10 years roughly, without the stock moving. Investing in dividend stocks within an IRA at age 23 is one of the smartest things you can do. Keep a 20% chunk of your portfolio available for investing in growth and 10% for risk tolerance, and invest 70% into dividend paying stocks, reits and funds. My children are holding a couple hundred shares of ATT until they are in their 30’s. That is an appreciating asset."
03/18/2021,stocks,Thank you for the input!
03/18/2021,stocks,Thanks for the input!
03/18/2021,stocks,"S&P 500 averages 10% a year so that compounded over 10 years is.. higher than 79%. 

My dad bought me lots of T and NLY when I was a baby and it costs me tens of thousands of dollars. OP (hopefully) will not need need his ROTH money until retirement. Take some risks. Try to get in early on the next AMZN or AAPL and enjoy the 1000% returns like many people here did."
03/18/2021,stocks,"> A 6% dividend reinvested will earn you 79% over 10 years roughly, without the stock moving. 

This is absolutely misleading. This assumes 1=/=1 and that the company creates money out of thin air. 

Every time on the ex date the value of the share drops by the amount of the dividend because a company cannot pay out cash without devaluing itself. A dividend is nothing more than a transfer of cash, meaning someone (the company) loses money/value. So assuming there is no upward or downward movement in share prices except on the ex date, you will have moved nowhere even if you reinvest dividends."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You’re welcome. Your current portfolio is perfect for our age, I believe."
03/18/2021,stocks,"True, but unless you are buying every stock in the S&P, you are likely buying funds, which once you calculate management fees, it isn’t truly a 10% average. There are plenty of dividend paying stocks that fluctuate. You likely won’t see huge increases in the strike price, but the dividends are solid. It should be an allocated position of any portfolio."
03/18/2021,stocks,That’s why my kids just received $90 in dividends and the share value went up over a dollar! What ex date do you speak of? We aren’t discussing options.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Any good ETF has a management fee of like .0015. The small dividends the S&P 500 pay cover that alone, easily. 

Dividends are for old people, plain and simple."

03/18/2021,stocks,With which parameters?
03/18/2021,stocks,"A non answer in case you don't know where to start: Check the ratios against their competitors and against historic averages.  Price to earnings, Price to sales, EV to EBITDA are the classic ratios."
03/18/2021,stocks,They also just acquired Auth0 so that could go either way for them.
03/18/2021,stocks,"It’s impossible to give a definitive answer without knowing the company stocks, but I would *strongly* encourage option 3 and reinvesting rather than taking a gamble on a lame duck."
03/18/2021,stocks,Is option 3 not free money with no risk? Why wouldn’t you do that?
03/18/2021,stocks,"My thoughts exactly, I'm just curious to see if anything is said to make me think otherwise."
03/18/2021,stocks,For me it keeps me engaged in current events. I still may not have a full understanding but I’m noticing more things on the news and thinking about implications.
03/18/2021,stocks,I added stress to my life after I started dealing with individual stocks. My life was much better just dumping my money in ETFs. Boring but with no stress.
03/18/2021,stocks,It's totally gambling and gives the same high.
03/18/2021,stocks,"what you mean, is 'do not let your enjoyment turn into an addiction'. 

taking a break is always good and cheap idea. 

&#x200B;

but please make sure whatever your assumption is that you hedge against it as well. 

&#x200B;

be safe and trade responsibly."
03/18/2021,stocks,Welcome to the market. Enjoy your stay. Always have an extra beer or two in the fridge. If the market goes up you can celebrate. If the market goes down you might need a drink.
03/18/2021,stocks,Let me introduce you to options...
03/18/2021,stocks,"I think most people can agree with you. Its not necessarily investing, but just adding interest in your life outside of the typical will do that. Life always feels a little more exciting when you get into something new.

And then add in the layer of it being mature, responsible and productive and then you have a habit and interest youre proud of. It doesnt feel like ""wasting"" time like netflix, social media, etc."
03/18/2021,stocks,"It absolutely is gambling and that’s why it’s fun to see the numbers go up and down.

But yes, there is a benefit of just learning more about companies and economics too. I think that part is fun. Keeping disciplined and not getting too carried away with it is key (something I had to work on)."
03/18/2021,stocks,It’s like fantasy football but for life
03/18/2021,stocks,"Agree. I learn a lot a things, reading news, following companies etc. It occupies my brain. Moreover, a part of my portfolio (around 8k) is invested in some exciting penny stocks, which may make rich.

Stocks are fun, and as long as I dont lose half of my portfolio I am calm"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Respect the greens and respect the reds. If you're only balls deep on excitement of greens, youre still a noob. Red days = buying opportunities and DCA. If your heart drops and you feel like shit when it's red, you putting too much money in stocks"
03/18/2021,stocks,"You're describing a gambling addiction.

Meanwhile, everyone here is gonna advise you to ~~recoup your gambling losses~~ buy the dip."
03/18/2021,stocks,Gives me a purpose ✌️💰 I had no purpose before stock trading a few friends had also noticed I had no purpose
03/18/2021,stocks,"Agreed but definitely hate the bears these last few weeks, they've steadily fucked my portfolio, and then let it ride back up just a bit to fuck it even harder the next day. Rough."
03/18/2021,stocks,Same. I realized it's like playing the same table top text game like Hearts of Iron or Total War like I used to except I can use it to talk with friends and earn some money or have better sleep because I'm too tired after getting fucked all day.
03/18/2021,stocks,I always tell people it's my hobby
03/18/2021,stocks,Same especially when I go red everyday
03/18/2021,stocks,"Given that I've spent almost all my time in the stock market under a pandemic lockdown the stock market has been the most exciting thing going on in my life. It's definitely had some impact on my productivity as well though, I've had to work for later on many days to counteract all the time I've spent trading during the day and watching my stonks. Particularly when the GME drama was playing out.

Like others have said, it's just another form of gambling that has better odds than a scratchcard 😂."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Sir, this is a Wendy’s."
03/18/2021,stocks,Is it just bears and bulls? What about apes?
03/18/2021,stocks,https://www.align.financial/good-investing-isnt-exciting-in-fact-it-should-be-boring/ peter lynch agrees also.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Hell yeah, investing adds a lot to life."
03/18/2021,stocks,I know RIGHT!
03/18/2021,stocks,"I love it! I just tell people it’s a new hobby of mine where I can actually make money. I enjoy doing the DD, research, and watching those watch lists. Who knew that Stonks could be so much fun!!"
03/18/2021,stocks,\*you mean ever since you started gambling getting emotional to companies pretending you really give a fuck about
03/18/2021,stocks,You are. Just don't let it take over.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I am petty new to investing and I have been really enjoying it. I've had an IRA for years that I put money into but I only bought index funds since I don't want to gamble with my retirement. 

Recently I opened another investment account and started buying stocks and etf's and have been having a blast doing it. I get the basics but there is still so much I haven't figured out yet, like options. 

But it has been a fun hobby so far and keeps my mind busy"
03/18/2021,stocks,Amen brother
03/18/2021,stocks,It's only because it's new and you think you will get rich. It will end. The first time of everything is exciting. Even if you were mugged and survived you would feel a rush for a while.
03/18/2021,stocks,That’s the other thing too! You notice little things that are connected that you never noticed before
03/18/2021,stocks,"most of the time, the less you know the better. 

what I want is exposure in small forms so that I do not have to know what is going on, I am just interested in the payoff. 

and do not forget that the 'news' is mostly noise.  if anything use as negative correlation."
03/18/2021,stocks,Yes [implication](https://youtu.be/-yUafzOXHPE) is important.
03/18/2021,stocks,I have less stress since i found out about selling options... You can make money even w/o selling your stocks
03/18/2021,stocks,"I find it a safer form of gambling, at least for myself. Previously I could throw a hundred quid on the footy and if I lost that was it, the full hundred was gone. 

Same for the lottery. I haven't increased what I'm gambling, I've just climbed out of the bookies bed and into the brokerages bed. There's just a greater sense of control."
03/18/2021,stocks,Socially acceptable gambling!
03/18/2021,stocks,"meh but it's not purely chance, there is a logical basis for buying certain stocks."
03/18/2021,stocks,"the first month of stocks(january) I spent like 3hrs a day just staring at the screen trying to get rich in a day.

Now reformed me (two months later) is only staring at it for 45 minutes trying to get rich in 10 years! lol"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I thought i was the wolf when i found out about stocks, pennystocks in particular. Soon i found out i was the sucker that the wolf preyed on. Then i started to buy & hold and felt like warren buffet... Then i found out about selling options, now i feel like a full blown out casino! I agree with OP, life is definitely more exciting now."
03/18/2021,stocks,Hoping to blow a part of my tax return on options.  Okay I don’t have a margin account so I can’t do anything crazier than buying or selling options separately but still.
03/18/2021,stocks,Makes me like Monday's for the first time ever 😆
03/18/2021,stocks,"I never worry about the bears in fantasy football, though"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Was thinking the same here the other day. If you want an edge in FPL you have to keep updated on every teams fixture, look at team news and player price predictions. So I can see many similarities to be slightly ahead in the marked too."
03/18/2021,stocks,"When it comes to stocks, patience is your BFF"
03/18/2021,stocks,Or things that appear connected but don’t understand why... like what I thought was positive news that dropped my cannabis stock by 15%
03/18/2021,stocks,You can also notice how corrupt the media is. You can tell who the Bears are and who the Bulls are. The narrative needs to be financially beneficial. But I really agreee with everything you and others have commented. I’m learning more about taxes; that’s a big piece. Good luck!!
03/18/2021,stocks,"what you mean is, you are 'doing and then learning about it afterwards' 

&#x200B;

I agreee with u."
03/18/2021,stocks,Knowledge is power. Not knowing things will always be your downfall.
03/18/2021,stocks,"This 1000x. Those ""financial news shows"" are almost always bullish at all time highs and bearish at all time lows.

Soon enough you'll be buying the top and selling the bottom.

Think for yourself  sell the tops and buy the bottoms."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yes but with the lottery n footy your payoff is capped. 

In the financial markets there is literally no roof above it."
03/18/2021,stocks,"There is no safe form of gambling, safer bets maybe. You risk a lot for a lower reward"
03/18/2021,stocks,"There is a logical basis for sports betting too. Trading stocks is gambling. Buying blue chip stocks or index funds where you hold for your lifetime is the only aspect of investing I don’t consider gambling. Also the word “gambling” seems to have a stigma associated with it, but there isn’t anything wrong with gambling if you don’t have an addiction and you can thoroughly understand the concept of risk/reward. It really is just simply risking something hoping for an improved outcome in the future. If trading stocks wasn’t gambling then everyone would be rich. The only people who will always gain money are the people who hold  long term since the stock market has always went up in the long term, and hence why I don’t consider that gambling."
03/18/2021,stocks,It can trend along the gambling line toward sports betting. I've done a lot of sports betting and some trading isn't too far in nature. There's analysis but you're still hoping things bounce your way.
03/18/2021,stocks,Sell options for money 💰
03/18/2021,stocks,"Totally agree with that, so many people think they will get rich in a few months from stock trading. LOL. Ive been investing in companies I believe in for the long ride (with a few riskier plays of course). And Ive been using these fat dips to buy more and lower my averages for more profit in the future. I would actually be excited if some of my favorite stocks came crashing down because I would buy 100s of shares and get my average super low for the ride back up!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah! DIS announces record Disney+ subscriptions and announces reopening Disneyland and the stock...goes up three bucks? And is back down now again. OK, Boomers."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Agree in principle, but its hard to tell whether we’re knowing the right things with some of these articles. There’s always agendas behind them. Pushing what the author or whoever is pulling the strings wants us to believe."
03/18/2021,stocks,"That's what I said, safer. Stop losses add quite a bit of control into how big your potential losses can be.

As for reward that's debatable. 2 to 1 bets are my usual for the bookies. I've 400%'ed a couple of stocks in the last 6 months alone."
03/18/2021,stocks,Especially me selling options. Risking everything to gain a  1% premium
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah but once a match is over your money's either there or gone.

You can pretty much close your app and never open it again for years and be all the richer for it."
03/18/2021,stocks,I sold my first options contact for money today. All my other ones expired OTM
03/18/2021,stocks,awesome plan until the dip keeps dipping
03/18/2021,stocks,Absolutely agree but what I mean involves having the knowledge to separate factual useful information from false ones
03/18/2021,stocks,4x on a stock is not unusual in this current low interest rate inflated market. The market has been a casino rigged in your favor where those 400% gainers are just the free drinks to keep you playing. The hedge funds are licking their chops waiting for everyone to get drunk at party before they bring the market down. And your stop losses won’t protect you from large gap downs.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I just learned about selling puts for stocks you actually want at a price you're willing to pay. Then if the stock doesn't dip, you get paid a premium. If the stock does dip, you get paid a premium and buy the stock you were gonna buy anyway at a discount."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I guess it would compare more to options trading (the footy gambling scenario) whereas shares buying might be more along the lines of 'Newcastle united will finish in the bottom half of the table', which would be a fairly safe bet but yield less favourable gains'.

It was a bad analogy on my part."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Until the stock dips way below your strike and the person you sold the option to exercises it, forcing you to buy the stock several dollars per share above its current price. It's not without its own risks."
03/18/2021,stocks,"At a discount to what you’re willing to pay, but more expensive than their fmv at the time?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah I get you, odds are odds, depends what your betting on."
03/18/2021,stocks,Yes of course nothing in the market is without risk
03/18/2021,stocks,That’s no different than if they bought a limit order at $120 and then it dropped after. Except he got paid premium to do it.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Like if you’d buy Apple at 120 and you have the cash to buy 100 shares, you sell a put for 120 and collect the premium. If the stock dips, you get your shares at the strike price plus premium. If it doesn’t dip you keep the premium anyway."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Except you can cancel a limit order whenever you want. Once you've sold an option the only way to get rid of it is for it to either expire worthless or buy it back to close, potentially for a higher price than you sold it for. They aren't the same at all."
03/18/2021,stocks,"People have been talking about this crash since 2012.

We did sorta crash just a year ago, but I guess we forgot about that already 🤷‍♂️"
03/18/2021,stocks,My dad has been convinced the market is going to tank any day now for the last 10 years. He also thinks housing is going to crash any day now too. He got rekt in the 2008 recession so he is absurdly conservative.
03/18/2021,stocks,Some people are trying to be the one that “called” the crash and then can say I told you so.  If they “predict” it over and over loud enough eventually they’ll be right and will have called it.
03/18/2021,stocks,"It's just overreaction to seeing red. The S&P has had 21 down weeks and 31 up weeks in the last year since the Mar 2020 low. It has also had 3 down months and 9 up months. It is still up 70%, which in a year is crazy. It's still up 17% from before the pre-COVID high, which is also still a very good year."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Because the longer the market remains in a bull run the higher the probabilities it will eventually crash. With stimulus checks going out and inflation being kept at bay until 2023, there arent that many reasons why it would crash except for FUD spreading or significant events like war, crises, etc... 

Apart from the above reasons, if the market were to crash soon, it would be because people would want to pull out before the crash and inadvertently induce the crash themselves. There’s really nothing suggesting an imminent crash apart from “ong its going to crash” articles and naysayers."
03/18/2021,stocks,"There's a difference between calling a bubble and calling a crash, bubbles can go on for years and not pop, if someone is calling a crash soon they are trying to time."
03/18/2021,stocks,Market crash = Garage sale 🦍🖍
03/18/2021,stocks,"If I can compare the UK market to the US.

At the start of the pandemic the UK market crashed. We have no significant trading activity from direct private investors.  The market consists large corporates that manage the investments.  

The US on the other hand has a huge volume of 'amateur'  investors from the self managed pension through to the home based day traders. 

The US money hasn't stopped flowing into the market and while it's still being propped up by new money itll keep going up. 

The stock price should reflect the dividend return, the underlying asset value and the goodwill of the business.  UK top 100 yield is close to 3%. US top 500 is 1.5%. 

The fear is US stock prices reflect demand for the stock 'because the price is going up' and not the true value because the business is generating or will a return on investment."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Boomer analysts wake up everyday and announce the market will crash because they know eventually they will be right, whether it's 1 year away or 10 years. Everyone wanting to be the next Michael Barry"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yes it's completely normal to see doom and gloom in CNBC, MSN Money, CNN Money, and all the rest.  The truth is nobody knows when a crash or correction will happen, but nobody wants to read that.  People want excitement, either rocket ships or crashes right? It's all one big stupid game with all of these financial sites/networks because that's what sells.  The only way to do it is spread you money in index funds, keep contributing during highs and lows, and just keep trucking until retirement.  Honestly you're better off not reading any of these articles and don't watch that old douchebag Cramer, it's just entertainment."
03/18/2021,stocks,"There’s a lot of reversion to the mean in stocks: when things are way overvalued, they eventually tend to go down to being undervalued, and so on. The thing is, this is probabilistic and can play out over a very long time; there’s no rule about when it happens.

So it can be reasonable to note that the market is likely going to have a downturn at some point, while also not really knowing if it’s happening soon or in years."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Look at this. Stocks have only been more expensive one other time in my lifetime.

Then there's the fact almost all tech stocks grew 100% in a pandemic year, EVs and batteries growing 1000% per year, every single EV spac starts with a ludicrous valuation, oh yeah, did I mention SPACs? People were calling it free money a month ago.

All the signs of the top are here, but you can't time the top, could go on for half a year, or a few more years."

Name 1 CEO of Fortune 500 who is a pesimistic  downer , all the bear porn attracts attention and clicks , saying we will have issues but stocks go up over time doesn't sound sexy"
03/18/2021,stocks,"A few reasons, but mainly because prices are artificially high and they're terrified that treasury yields capable of beating inflation will pop the precious bubble. The usual complaints.

Businesses having to actually pay to borrow money might slow growth, but it won't actually kill it. Asset price inflation will just pick up these crazy companies by however much they fall in the long run anyhow.

This all just the beginning of the massive debt fueled money printing hangover we've been overdue to experience since the 2000 dot com bust.

I don't worry about it and if the S&P 500 goes to zero we're all going to have much bigger problems than what's going on in our portfolios. Dumb money is always long and it pays dividends."
03/18/2021,stocks,Well there is a lot of debt and not many people can pay it off especially because of the pandemic. And the Fed already had interest rates low asf so they can’t lower them anymore in the event of a collapse.
03/18/2021,stocks,"The jury is still out for QE and modern monetary theory imo. Bubbles can persist for a very long time though, and the bears who call crashes are incorrect most of the time. The best move is to buckle up for the ride, and see it through to the end."
03/18/2021,stocks,A lot of tech is already in a bear market
03/18/2021,stocks,Because now more than ever (in my lifetime) fundamentals just don’t fucking matter.
03/18/2021,stocks,Because being a contrarian is the cool thing to be. In reality it is being an idiot.
03/18/2021,stocks,People fear the unknown and there is a lot of unknown in the market. Crashing will always be a possibility so some people will always be afraid of it and talk about it. It's scary for some.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Go to pretty much any stock graph, zoom out to a 5 year view, and the answer is pretty clear."
03/18/2021,stocks,"It's PTSD from the 08 global financial crisis. 


It's like when soldiers get shot, then whenever they hear loud noises like fireworks, they think they're getting shot. 

They read fear mongering clickbait article headlines, and they are triggered and think that another crash is coming."
03/18/2021,stocks,"The thing is, if the Fed stops ""printing money"" and lets the market fend for itself, the market will crash or at least suffer a huge correction. I think the only reason why we haven't seen more crashes is because the Fed is propping up the market. I don't think the Fed will stop any time soon though. Not sure what the long term effects will be."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I asked a finance guy about it. Even with all the wars and past crashes and whatnot, in the long term S&P has been steadily growing. If you go longterm and don't invest all in one day you will be fine.

1 of the reasons a crash is coming is as you mentioned it is somewhat of a bubble right now, and the GME short squeeze is coming which some speculate it will cause many stocks to crash as hedge funds will be forced to liquidate their assets. This will introduce a good buying opportunity and the market will recover in the long term and probably maintain it's steady growth."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Two points: firstly, the existence of a market means that the buyer is always the marginal buyer, so values are always at the edge of what the most optimistic person thinks it is.

Second, and more importantly, I think your question has to do with valuations. We're seeing PE, PEG, and other valuation ratios significantly higher than historical averages.

I think much of what is driving the markets is a consensus that earnings don't matter, and that this is generally being driving by the fact that borrowing is so cheap, that you can just sort of build/bet on a young company without having to recoup costs quickly.

There is a lot of throwing around the term ""unprecedented"" but these low interest rates are [genuinely unprecedented](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-history-of-interest-rates-over-670-years/). 

The consequences are that these valuations (this market) will likely not fare well when people don't want to loan out their money for essentially nothing. Inflation concerns see to be driving that. 

Not financial advice."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Because you can't h ave infinite growth. Do you realize why the reason why things increase in ""value"" is because the dollar actually becomes less valuable? A house doesn't actually increase in value, it just gets harder to buy.

&#x200B;

Lets say you make 100k a year and you want to buy a 100k house... so you start working for a year to save up... but by the end of the year the house costs 200k. Do you see the problem? You are never going to get that house!

&#x200B;

For example, I posted in WSB that maybe WSB was a scam by HF's or others to convince retail to bet everything on these stocks so they could steal it(basically pump and dump)... comment was immediately removed. No one knows if some post by some account is legit or not. For all we know most of the posts about YOLOing could be fake just to hype the stock to retail.

The stock market is being manipulated, that is fact. You end up with people/HF's with multiple accounts playing both sides: 1. They buy X shares on one account and short X shares on the other. They buy slow and short fast. This drives down stock. Anything that the stock does they break even except for interest. By by doing this they can 2: make the stock go up and down in predicable waves and take retail investors money who can't hang on.

Then throw in all the media manipulation and you  end up turning the economy in to a casino. It's no longer a legit place to invest. Even if Warren Buffet is making money he's still losing some because everything is tied together. Devaluation takes over screwing everything up and the people that lose the most are the poor. The wealth gap increases and the rich get more power to screw over society(buy off more politicians, rig the system more, etc). You think this can keep going?

It's not a SM crash that is the problem, it's an economy crash that sends us back 200 years. That almost happened in 2008. Each time it gets more likely to happen(it's almost as if it is intentionally being done to bring down America but one can almost attribute it to greed)."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Crash is unfortunately a nebulus word. Some might think a crash is 10%, while others see massive destruction in value. Personally I fall into the camp that believes a massive wealth transfer will occur in the next several decades from the West to the East. As much as people like to demonize and call Peter Schiff a fool for example, on that particular point I think he is correct.

The US has enjoyed the ability to serve as the world reserve currency for over a hundred years now. The ability to dictate world politics by monetary manipulation will eventually end though. The lenders that provided endless loans to cover US debts will come to the realization that not a dime of that money will ever be paid back. Honestly 28 trillion and counting with no end in sight. The dollar will fall to history just like so many other fiat paper based currencies. Once that happens countries that have all the production and material producing means (China probably be #1) their currency will supplant the US dollar. Some think that process will take years, others believe it will happen almost overnight with Americans waking up to an announcement that most world powers are switching to a new reserve currency. As soon as that happens, the purchasing power of the dollar and its valuation in the stock market will be obliterated."

I agree there aren't any technical reasons for an impending crash, but isn't this psychological concern a real possibility? The more well-known people start predicting a crash, the more jumpy people get. The jumpier people are, the more panic selling will occur on red days, which makes everything super volatile. The more volatile things get, the more FUD spreads, and so on. Combine that with absurd valuations, even at low interest rates, that everyone knows will eventually return to historical levels, and you likely have a huge portion of the market anxious to get out before that happens."

Exactly. I have recently heard people claim that stocks should be bought based on hype and not fundamentals. That can work for a while, but will almost certainly hurt in the long run.

What scares me is that it seems impossible to find anything not overvalued by traditional metrics. While much of that is easily explainable through low interest rates, we won't have low rates forever. The market takes a hit, and tech stocks get killed, every time the 10-year yield increases slightly. To me, that is a seriously scared market."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Also, eventually they will have to increase interest rates, so this run can't last forever. The market takes a huge hit every time the 10-year yield increases slightly. If it continues to climb, there probably still won't be a crash, but it's going to get ugly."

First off: GME may have already squeezed. I won't pretend to know what's going on with it but I do know that there is a decent likelihood that the squeeze finished in January.

&nbsp;

>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer‑term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.

You don't realize that if the right set of circumstances happens that it could throw humanity back in to the dark ages. You seem to think that people will continue to go to work making medicines, gas, electricity, food, supplies, gaskets, replacement parts, machines, alternators, bacteria, and the millions other things when they are not getting paid.

You don't realize that the world economy is a house of cards. It relies on a vast number of interconnected parts to all function and a failure of any part could bring down everything. Suppose oil vanished tomorrow. You know what would happen? Sure you don't but I'll tell you: The entire world would stop functioning as we know it. There won't be enough electric vehicles to supply all the food, all the oil, spare parts, transportation to and from work, etc.

It isn't so much that these failures are necessarily critical it is that our societies are not designed to handle them. We have no plan to on how to organize when TSHTF. It will be pure chaos on a scale never seen and that is what will cause the collapse. Luckily we have the internet which might allow for mass communications, but this assumes people will work together. If things crash bad enough you will end up with dictators trying to take over. The government will become impotent and then the real fun begins.

Look how badly sars-cov2 was handled... and you think that if the stock market crashed that the government isn't going to make things worse? Not sure what world you are living in. It isn't that it necessarily will happen if the stock market drops 20%... it's that the likelihood of such a catastrophic event occurring happens more and more the worst things get and so it is just a matter of time. If that time in the next 5 years? Next 100 years? No one knows, but we do know it gets more likely with time(it doesn't half too but that is what happens when you let lunatics and morons run the show).

E.g., suppose we end up with a very bad stock market crash, a very bad sars-cov2 variant, and really bad earthquake, and a typhoon all at the same time? It might push us past a threshold where there is no recovery(point of no return). It might be a slow decay at first as people are clueless of the large scale dynamics involved, but maybe over a few months or few years things start to go exponentially down... you know, kinda like it feels now.

I agree - in general it’s tricky to see who is “fearful” and “greedy”. 

But one of the defining attributes of a bubble is that stocks detach from their fundamental values, go up because they go up, and make returns that makes anyone who ISNT already invested, wish that they were. After all (another quote) “seeing your neighbour get rich is about as irritating as anything that life has to offer”

03/18/2021,stocks,"It had a massive run up in 2020 (crazy bull market, lots of deals and news, two dilutions, deal in Korea, Biden renewable energy hype)  started to pull back once it hit $75, then missed their q4 earnings estimates (on what they say was amzn and wmt exercising warrants). This was pretty recent, shortly before 10 year T note yields spiked and growth stocks started to correct, so it continued to tank as the broader market tanked.  Also around this time they announced their March financial reports would be delayed, which was basically foreshadowing this accounting debacle that dropped this week. 

Analysts are maintaining their bullish ratings, although I don’t know if this whole issue w the accounting has been factored in yet. Right now it’s unclear what the new accounting will report. The company is signalling that it’s all good. 

Basically, decide if you believe in H2 economy in general, and if you do, PLUG is probably still the best choice at the moment  (they actually have product and contracts w lots of big companies, and also have raised a lot of capital this last year). Tbh you should be looking forward like 5-10 years for profits. If H2 energy becomes widespread, these guys will be a major player. 

Also, maybe just wait till after this whole accounting thing if you haven’t bought yet. I do have a position RN, and successfully traded it a bunch on the way up, but my current ACB is like $56 which is not great.

03/18/2021,stocks,"Awesome information thank you. So I bought 19 shares at $12.85 August 2020. And then decided to buy 50 more shares at $65.25 in January thinking that it was just going to keep going up. Big mistake, I know. Long story short, my robinhood front page is showing that I’m below the value I started with ($5,000). What should I do?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I don't think we know the extent until they release the republished accounts - not sure how you can make the call that this is nothing just based on their management's statements. Analysts remained bullish on Enron right up to bankruptcy, I am not sure why people take what they write so seriously."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I don't think we know the extent of things - this could be just the tip of the iceberg, once the SEC starts investigating there may be more nefariousness living below the surface at Plug. This could blow over but the reality is no one besides maybe a few insiders at this point know the extent of things. It is great to have faith but you need to also understand the risk and the downside. We are talking about a company in business for 25 years without coming close to turning a profit and is valued like they do $2b+ in sales every year - instead their highest revenue year was just over $200m and last year they had negative revenue because of the ridiculous warrants for Amazon. You have to bet that they are able to stay alive by selling stock and diluting shares, all the while they are burning more money operationally every quarter. There is so much possible risk here, there are other much better looking investments out there."
03/18/2021,stocks,Can’t really say anything about them until they provide accurate financials. Accounting fraud is nothing to ignore
03/18/2021,stocks," I sold at 37.50 and bought it at 43.71. 

did you mean sold at 43.71 and bought at 37.50?"
03/18/2021,stocks,Absolutley. Don‘t worth the risk and fear of total crash...
03/18/2021,stocks,I agree that we dont know the extent of things but regardless of what they made mistakes on they are still the largest US hydrogen company and have a great chance of booming with Biden in office. European countries have already shifted toward implementing Hydrogen power on large scales and the US is bound to follow their tracks. Renewable energy would not be efficient without Hydrogen power. When the solar panels/wind turbines are not providing enough power what will we do? The answer is hydrogen fuel cells.
03/18/2021,stocks,I wouldn't say fraud. If they were intentionally trying to make fraudulent changes to the books they wouldn't be the ones snitching on themselves. LOL. No one snitches on themselves for intentionally doing something wrong if theres no one questioning them doing it wrong. They are being transparent about a mistake.
03/18/2021,stocks,It wasn't fraud...
03/18/2021,stocks,"There are other companies that make fuel cells - and I don't see why a large energy company won't pivot and take over this industry in the US. I am not too familiar with the hydrogen fuel cell playing field, but from what I can tell it consists of a bunch of companies burning an insane amount of cash at this point."
03/18/2021,stocks,Better to “snitch” on yourself rather the. The sec finding out 🙄
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah because for hydrogen power to become a big thing, the country must be trying to shift toward renewables - something I think will begin happening in the near future with Biden. Once we do gravitate toward a shift to clean energy, fuel cells will be in higher demand and the companies will take off. As large companies can continue to use fossil fuels without investing in new infrastructure, they will do so. But a major push by the government to shift to renewables will spark a large boom in all of the clean energy sector."
03/18/2021,stocks,"But again, why would they make fraudulent changes if they were planning on ratting themselves out? Obviously if they were doing it intentionally in the first place, they would continue on hoping the fraud is not detected."
03/18/2021,stocks,So you have to hope for Green Energy legislation to pass in order for this to pay off? And specifically legislation that favors Fuel Cells? Otherwise this is a cash-hemorrhaging machine. I try to avoid companies where all of the possible good future news is priced into the stock - one disappointment and it all comes crashing down. The company has no path to profitability unless something massively changes in the green energy economy.
03/18/2021,stocks,You need to have certain net worth
03/18/2021,stocks,You’ll have to research the private funding but most require a very large investment usually in the millions
03/18/2021,stocks,"Assuming you’re an accredited investor you can buy private shares here

https://www.investx.com

There isn’t a formal process for being accredited but if you’re branching into angel investing a lot of companies that are raising funds will do their due diligence because they don’t want scrubs on their cap table"
03/18/2021,stocks,Did openai file for ipo?
03/18/2021,stocks,"If you can invest in a company pre ipo, you probably should not!"
03/18/2021,stocks,And become accredited investor
03/18/2021,stocks,"No set date yet, but it is happening. At least that's what the official page says."
03/18/2021,stocks,That is awful advice
03/18/2021,stocks,Why not?
03/18/2021,stocks,SpaceX is privately held. Check out the ETFs MOON and UFO for more potential companies in ARKX.
03/18/2021,stocks,NSH (Spire Global) and NPA (Spacemobile) are a couple more you should check out. Low downside trading near the DA price with massive upside. I’m bullish on VACQ as well.
03/18/2021,stocks,MAXR will also be a holding in the space ETF no doubt about it
03/18/2021,stocks,"I have exposure in Space stocks via Boeing, LMT, Raytheon. I want the USA to launch the space marines. No doubt the normal military companies listed above will get the contracts, and they already have them for many satellites and things."
03/18/2021,stocks,MOON is moonshot etf and not space related right?
03/18/2021,stocks,Correct but there is some overlap with space adjacent companies.
03/18/2021,stocks,Fidelity
03/18/2021,stocks,"Why not invest in an ETF that has video game companies rolled into it?

Edit: Of course, if trading rather than investing I can see avoiding an ETF."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Honestly for the amount of shit it gets, RobinHood still is the most user friendly app for most investors. I’ll probably get hate for this but honestly idc. I’m still using them because there is no equal or better alternative. Plain and simple."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Ally bank, good savings rate too"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Many major brokers out there,they all have an app.Schwab,Merrill Edge,Mass Mutual,Principal tons of them.Search stockbroker ls in your app store."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I love Schwab. Maybe not as user-friendly, but I have no complaints and their customer service is top tier!"
03/18/2021,stocks,E*TRADE is pretty decent. I’ve been using it and had no real problems.

03/18/2021,stocks,"Every single one in canada fucking suck, we need some good ones"
03/18/2021,stocks,Find an’y company that has at least a trillion value. Then you won’t run into those issues like you did with rh.
03/18/2021,stocks,[removed]
03/18/2021,stocks,I second Fidelity.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Hi, 

Sorry I am a noon when it comes to this stuff. Whats the difference between ""trading"" and ""investing"" i thought they were interchangeable terms. 

Thank you."
03/18/2021,stocks,It takes only one bad experience and I hope you don't get shit for just having opinion.
03/18/2021,stocks,It’s simple to use. My portfolio I swing trade with is on Fidelity but I use RH to look at stocks quickly
03/18/2021,stocks,Value of design.
03/18/2021,stocks,Using RH is like buy Hertz stock. A lot of people did it and some even made money but it was a bankrupt company.  Good luck
03/18/2021,stocks,Stop.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I would classify a trader as someone whom buys stock only intending to keep it for a short period of time and sell when they have attained their profit goal or even sometimes sell for a loss to then buy a different stock that may have more potential.

An investor is more along the lines of someone whom wants to hold a position for a longer period of time.

Many people are both traders and investors. Meaning they have a portfolio of long term stocks and then they trade a few other stocks to attempt to make profits quicker."
03/18/2021,stocks,Exactly. I have my serious account on schwab but for just quick charts and some info I’ll use RH. I also use them for my “fun” account cause I can use them on the go and trade growth stocks a lot easier.
03/18/2021,stocks,"How is it bankrupt? Offer some actual proof before tossing out stuff like that. If anything after this whole GME episode they have more cash then ever. Additionally robinhood is insured so even if they do, you’re money is protected."
03/18/2021,stocks,gotchya. Yeah I am more of a trader but once I build up more I am planning to invest long term.  Thank you for the info
03/18/2021,stocks,"It's an analogy to illustrate (perhaps poorly) that RH is a gamble.  They don't have your best interest in mind. Their business model rest on violating their fiduciary duty to you.

Try some boomer brokers ...some real brokers.  Boomers aren't getting dry fucked out of their gains by silicon valley start-ups"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I have my retirement Roth on schwab. I use RH for growth and gamble stocks. That’s it. Idc if they sell what I’m buying, not like some hedge fund is tracking my trades and moving on them so why do I care?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Great stock, it will be included in the AEX (largest index of the Netherlands) on the 22th of march."
03/18/2021,stocks,Yes they do.   Issued and outstanding is the term for what goes into it.   Available to trade is the float which is the 6%.   Market cap and eps use issued and outstanding
03/18/2021,stocks,Yeah it's all the shares. Total shares \* share price = market cap.
03/18/2021,stocks,"So in this case outstanding is 94% and issued is 6%. Total of both is 15b issued worth 900m? 
If this is the case is share prices based on total or issued?"
03/18/2021,stocks,Right but total shares available as in the 6% in uwmc case or total shares as in 100% of them whether available or not
03/18/2021,stocks,"Not quite. Market cap only takes into account those issued shares that are not held in the company's treasury. A company can issue common shares which it holds in the treasury (for example in order to cover possible share compensation of insiders or the possibility that holders of convertible shares or warrants choose to exercise their right to get common shares) and it can also buy back shares from the market and place them in its treasury.

Also note that the number of shares issued (=shares outstanding+treasury shares) can be increased by the company through a ""seasoned share issue"" up to the maximum number of authorized shares stipulated in the articles of incorporation. Generally a seasoned issue requires shareholder approval, as does any change in the authorized shares (the latter also requires amending the articles of incorporation). 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seasonedissue.asp"
03/18/2021,stocks,"The number of issued shares is larger  than that of outstanding shares since it also includes treasury shares. See here:

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp)

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurystock.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurystock.asp)

issued = treasury+ outstanding

Shares outstanding includes the share float and the restricted stock held by insiders:

[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-is-companys-float/](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-is-companys-float/)

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restrictedstock.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restrictedstock.asp)

outstanding = restricted + float

Notice that all of this refers to common stock, though similar distinctions apply to preferred stock and warrants.

Usually the market cap takes into account only the shares outstanding since the shares held in the treasury are not available to be traded:

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp)"
03/18/2021,stocks,Total shares as in 100% of them regardless of if they are available.
03/18/2021,stocks,That's a useful website thanks
03/18/2021,stocks,So in the case above for market cap to go up a million does it need a million put in or does it go up a million when 60k is put in since that's 6% of a million?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Notice that restricted shares can be traded into the market by insiders (in which case they become part of the float) according to schedules set by company policy and SEC rules. That's why they are included in the shares outstanding and in the computation of market capitalization.

Also the company can buy back shares from the open market to add to its treasury (which reduces float and the shares outstanding) or can sell treasury shares into the open market (which increases float and shares outstanding). Usually this is subject to various company policies and requires shareholder approval."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Interesting question. The price of a share of stock is determined by the bid-ask spread which basically matches buyers and sellers. If there are more buyers than sellers it drives the bid-ask (and the share price) up, and vice versa. The problem with assuming that putting in a million dollars would drive the market cap up 1 million is that you're not actually paying the company for the shares, you are paying someone else who already owns the shares. 

It's an interesting question though because if only 6% of the shares are being traded, then theoretically it should be easier to influence the price of the stock through buying and selling. [Here](https://warriortradingnews.com/2019/01/10/how-stock-float-affects-share-prices/) is an article that touches on it a bit."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Makes sense that price is more related to what people think it's worth than how many shares or what the cap is. 
I've been seeing some companies with crazy high market caps and wondering why it is and it makes more sense now that it probably high share prices plus low float. 
Thanks for taking the time. Helped me out."
03/18/2021,stocks,I sold my 65Cs 5 minutes before close yesterday 🤦‍♂️
03/18/2021,stocks,Damn. Only have 10 shares at $59. Lol
03/18/2021,stocks,oof
03/18/2021,stocks,sold mine for 60.72 also im feeling the pain rn
03/18/2021,stocks,Well now you have the equivalent of 20 shares at $59 haha. Never be upset with gains brotha
03/18/2021,stocks,Misery loves company :)
03/18/2021,stocks,Aaaaaand just sold half at $120.
03/18/2021,stocks,Yup expected it to go down even with good earnings just like every other stock this year.  Bouta punch a wall
03/18/2021,stocks,"If it helps, I sold too early on GameStop and missed out on $150k, my father did the same and missed out on $4M+. (Which would’ve meant early retirement)

We just remind ourselves that there are always more opportunities to find!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Thanks bro that definitely helped.  I just started investing about a year ago so this was my first time i lost out on a good profit, but I definitely needed it as a lesson.  Still glad to see other people making money off this stock."
03/18/2021,stocks,Tell your friends to yolo into stocks you have weeklies for
03/18/2021,stocks,">Warren Buffett slammed bonds on Saturday, saying the fixed-income market is ""not the place to be these days."" Historically low Treasury yields and negative-yielding debt in some countries leave debt investors facing ""a bleak future,"" he added.

[Warren Buffets stupid advice?](https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-bond-investors-bleak-future-low-yields-treasury-market-2021-3#:~:text=Warren%20Buffett%20slammed%20bonds%20on,bleak%20future%2C%22%20he%20added.)"
03/18/2021,stocks,Stop telling your friends what financial products to buy. This is relationship advice.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Who is telling them to buy bonds? Warren Buffett doesn't advocate that, quite the [opposite](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/warren-buffett-says-bond-investors-face-a-bleak-future-as-yields-remain-near-historic-lows/ar-BB1e7tCJ) actually. What percent of their portfolio is bonds?"
03/18/2021,stocks,Some people can’t be talked out of their mind
03/18/2021,stocks,They'll probably have a change of heart in 5 years or so when they see what their money could have done for them.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Bonds are no longer trading like bonds, they’re just lower risk equities, and the lower risk is in a niche where bankruptcy is prevalent."
03/18/2021,stocks,"It’s their decision, unfortunately"
03/18/2021,stocks,Some people like to be safe. Some people are more risky. Maybe your friends don't like the stress of watching stocks go up and down every day? It's their money and their decision.
03/18/2021,stocks,"It's for diversification. Bonds are not attractive now, but they sure weren't looking too bad at the end of 2019. Some people like to take a passive approach. If their bonds lose value, they'll reallocate and move on with their lives without thinking too much (while moving forward with higher yields). Not everyone has to take an active approach. And a diversified portfolio has been proven to offer lower volatility without lowering returns too much. I realize that may not be important to you because it's ""irrational"", but again, passive investing is certainly a fine strategy. 

That being said, hopefully they thought hard about their allocation. 10-20% in bonds isn't going to ruin them. 50% would definitely leave them behind the 8 ball."
03/18/2021,stocks,Would they rather have their money grow by 3.4% a year or 13% a year?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Are they buying only bonds? Or bonds and stocks? 

A lot of people here aren’t 100% invested in stocks. Some people keep cash on the side to buy more stocks in the event of a crash. If that’s a reasonable strategy, then holdings bonds with the intention of selling them to buy stocks in the event of a crash is also reasonable. Bonds give low returns but they do better then cash at least."
03/18/2021,stocks,Maybe you should get new friends
03/18/2021,stocks,"Fuck em. I've tried to educate many friends and family members about investing and out of all those people, only one person took my advice.  All you can do is try to help them but if they don't want to take your advice...oh well."
03/18/2021,stocks,Buying bonds never made sense to me either when you have  S&P500 giving you a higher return per year.
03/18/2021,stocks,Beats a savings account
03/18/2021,stocks,Who cares it's their money
03/18/2021,stocks,Tell them the best thing they can do is invest in an S&P 500 index fund.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Some people like safe money, it is not weird that some people would rather get a low interest with zero risk of loosing their money rather than having a high interest that comes with a risk of a loss. 

It is the same logic why most people would rather have a steady job with a salary over starting their own business with more potential reward.

It is their decision, you do you"
03/18/2021,stocks,Most people are risk adverse. They would rather have a 3% gain rather than risk a 5% loss.
03/18/2021,stocks,"This is probably just their risk tolerance. Maybe to them, this isn’t money they can afford to lose and will use in the next couple years? Probably when they build a bigger portfolio, they will have more play money they won’t be afraid to lose."
03/18/2021,stocks,VTIP might b ok
03/18/2021,stocks,"It's not a bad idea to carry *some* bonds, but yes, the majority of their portfolio should be in stocks."
03/18/2021,stocks,Dont think Buffet would ever advise bond lol.... even when bonds are way higher back in the days than it is now.
03/18/2021,stocks,"You can't fix stupid. If they're gonna waste their money, you can't stop them."
03/18/2021,stocks,Buffet has been trashing bonds for years. Who even buys that shit lol
03/18/2021,stocks,If there’s a dip aren’t they set up to sell the bonds at a premium and then buy the dip big time? Isn’t that the point of not putting literally everything into equities?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Maybe they are being safe. But if you don’t need the money for 40 years, being in bonds is a waste"
03/18/2021,stocks,Bond rates are going up and we are looking at a massive inflation situation in the future from printing all this money. Bonds will be less volitile through this time period.
03/18/2021,stocks,1.8% can suck my mediocre dick.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Some people just don't listen. I've tried to steer friends down the right path but all you can do is advise, it's their money. 

That being said, I don't own anything in the bond market,  my ""safe"" holdings in my retirement are index funds."
03/18/2021,stocks,I’m pretty sure buffet actually said bonds were garbage so I have no idea what advice your friends are listening to lol.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Don’t worry, you’ll have new rich friends soon enough and you can still visit your bond friends at Wendy’s."
03/18/2021,stocks,instructions unclear why did my wife get a boyfriend and why did I allow this?

03/18/2021,stocks,"There are bonds with 3.4% yields? I don't follow bonds closely, but I would have to imagine the default risk on that type of bond right now would be riskier than the stock market."

03/18/2021,stocks,Fr
03/18/2021,stocks,Fr bruh
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah, they sound excited when you first talk to them, but when you leave they totally forget about actually doing it, or blow it off."
03/18/2021,stocks,True but why would they invest in bonds for the long term. Index funds will always be up in the long term. It’s not like the s&p is gonna ever get delisted.
03/18/2021,stocks,I have a feeling someone read The Intelligent Investor & got in their ear
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yields were high 10 years ago (relatively), things change and if you dont adapt then you lose."
03/18/2021,stocks,Might want to get an update on WB opinion.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Exactly. In my opinion if you feel the need to have 10% of your portfolio in bonds to feel ""safe"" then do what you gotta do but people in their 20's are way better off just fully investing in the s&p 500 or something similar. Bonds run the double whammy right now of abysmal returns that probably won't even outpace inflation, combined with the potential of rising rates which will drive the underlying price of the bonds down.

&#x200B;

OP, your best bet at convincing your friends not to buy bonds is explaining that as rates rise the value of their bonds will decrease and the current rates are unlikely to even match inflation over the long term."
03/18/2021,stocks,They just love a challenge so they're just playing life on hard-mode.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Well, EE Savings Bond for individuals do yield 3.5% risk free tax deferred if you hold for 20 years no matter what (if you cash out before 20 years, 0.1%).

So there's that. But those aren't bonds that are available from BND and the like anyways. Those are bonds for individual level (not institutional) and the annual cap is like $10k."
03/18/2021,stocks,"If they were holdings bonds with that intention, it wouldn’t be so bad. That’s basically what most financial advisors would say to do. The typical advice is to hold a fixed percentage of a portfolio in bonds (like 30%). Then if stocks go down a lot, bonds would be making up more than 30% and stocks would be less than 70%, so they would sell bonds to buy more stock to compensate. But I never heard of anyone saying to buy bonds and always hold them."
03/18/2021,stocks,"If they rebalance, that would be done automatically."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Makes me crazy. Our secretary at work wants to start investing and was going to meet a financial advisor for the first time. I said NO! I’ll show you what to do it’s so easy!! I pulled up the vanguard site, explained how financial advisors fuck you, even put numbers into a calculator and showed her the extra 1% or more an advisor will charge can cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars over 30-40 years. And she still wrote that first check out to that financial advisor. I tried but really I don’t care.  Personal finance is like quantum physics to a lot of people....I really don’t get it."
03/18/2021,stocks,Maybe introduce them to target date retirement funds.
03/18/2021,stocks,"> Index funds will always be up in the long term.

What? Where do you get that FALSE info? Just because it didn't happen the last 10 years doesn't mean that's rule.

Index funds are just a collection of stocks usually. If you have let's say 20 companies and 2 go bankrupt in a short time, that a 10% loss. Sure new companies go into your fund, but the money is still gone.

Simple answer is: bonds are still way safer than every index fund"
03/18/2021,stocks,Man that’s a tough read. I’m open to all sources of information but I get 15 pages into that book and feel like walking into traffic.
03/18/2021,stocks,In 40 years will it really make a difference? I understand maybe 5% of your portfolio going into bonds a few years you retire so you have money on hand before you retire but still. Will it really make a difference in 40 years if you invest in the s&p 500
03/18/2021,stocks,Lmao. Good god I thought it was just me. The amount of time spent talking about bonds is ridiculous. They try to keep it updated but clearly the market just isn’t the same as it was then

03/18/2021,stocks,"Already been waiting two weeks for the train to leave. Still bullish. There was no reason for the sell off in February, but I‘m grateful for this buying opportunity!"
03/18/2021,stocks,Is the train leaving a literal analogy? I don’t know how mail gets transported these days because I haven’t mailed a letter in a decade.
03/18/2021,stocks,"As an Amazon and EBay seller, I have heard great things about the Shipstation interface, and god would I love to charge all my shipping costs to my credit card and earn 5x points. But the big thing that holds most Amazon sellers back from using it is Amazon will hold the liability for any orders that are lost or delayed by the carrier if they are bought through Amazon’s buy shipping program. That means if I buy through Amazon and USPS loses the package which they did a lot this year, when the customer gets refunded for missing the fulfillment promise the money comes out of Amazons pocket not the sellers. Until USPS gets as reliable as UPS, that’s going to be a very important consideration. Also Amazon passes on much better rates on UPS than many sellers can get on their own. I’m not quite sure what level of volume you would need to get comparable rates, it tends to be something that is negotiated on an individual basis. So when I sell on other marketplaces my personal preference is using Pirate Ship for USPS. They are free compared to I think about $80 a month with shipstation. They integrate with EBay beautifully and anywhere they don’t integrate with its an easy cut and paste. I think the rise of Shopify sites and other marketplaces will bode well for Shipstation, but they are going to have trouble acquiring primarily Amazon sellers as well as smaller sellers for whom their fees are too high compared to free options."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I got in around $180, and probably would have gone a bit sooner, but it seemed too good to be true. If this company even comes close to their earnings last quarter the stock could easily get back to $250 or more by summer, in my opinion."

03/18/2021,stocks,"It’s a two way analogy. 

Since its primary business involves shipping related subscription, the train leaving is signifying a mail train leaving(I haven’t thought about if mail trains actually exist these days or not).

And train leaving also signifies stock jumping from its lows to higher price."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Nice analysis. I have no first hand experience and am exclusively relying on online reviews and stuff.
But I also must point out that 1. Shipstation is not their only product.

2. They have different tiers.

3. You will likely get more than money back if you use their service enough.(at least that's what most seem to say)

4. I think you are right. If one is only selling on Amazon, then the various benefits of integration and stuff are useless, and if they are small time sellers, spending money wouldn’t be worth it."
03/18/2021,stocks,No clue but it's not the craziest idea in the would. If you don't feel like doing a ton of research just throw a small amount in and see what happens. Personally I'd love to see BigCockTyrone make a pretty penny on this one!

03/18/2021,stocks,"I’m not sure to be honest.  I’ve been wrong about a lot of stocks in the past:). 

There’s 3 things I’d look at though;

Their expansion into  China.  Are they still expanding and what’s their 2 year goal if they are?

Post Covid strategy, are they shifting to more online sales? Any hint to their online to store spread? (All brands)

Debt to income ratio or cash in hand ,currently and outlook 6 months from now.  

Jumping on a boat with Kanye to  me would be like buying xm radio when they signed howard stern.  Short term boost for publicity for long term, little to no roi."
03/18/2021,stocks,The thing making me not jump in to PLTR is the DD people present talking about “historically their price has sat between 24 and 26 blah blah blah” but as far as I can tell the company didn’t even begin trading until Q4 of 2020. Any price that they are currently trading at is still being found out isn’t it? Or is less than half a year a valid amount of time to establish a support level for a stock?
03/18/2021,stocks,This feels more like a bag holder support thread
03/18/2021,stocks,I'm holding PLTR with average cost of $40. Dumbest decision I've made so far.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm a PLTR holder, but to play devil's advocate your arguments are not convincing."
03/18/2021,stocks,Why under 26 specifically? What are your arguments to buy around this price? It dropped to 21 earlier so why should I buy between 24-26?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Looking at historical price as between 24-26 when the stock has only existed for 6 months is not a good idea.

This thing is wicked volatile, it's settled in this range a few times now and has support here, but I wouldn't treat it as a stock that has a proven range/value."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I feel like Palantir will just be one of those stocks that will remain flat around $25-26 for a while before gradually going up. If the prospective and outlook goes well for them, in 10 years time, people will be wondering why they didn't buy into it at $25."
03/18/2021,stocks,"So, where's your actual DD?"
03/18/2021,stocks,I also believe PLTR is a special one. But it’s only relevant for long term holders
03/18/2021,stocks,As a PLTR holder I just want you all to stop talking about it.
03/18/2021,stocks,Look at SUMO and AYX as cloud plays that have been beat down. They're worth a ride.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Hey OP, can you tell me what Palantir Technologies does as a company?"
03/18/2021,stocks,Their ceo also supports reddit traders
03/18/2021,stocks,"I own PLTR shares.  I like the stock.  I posted my basic analysis of the company's situation and future in another thread in this sub:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m6bwjr/pltr\_what\_would\_you\_do/gr6mu7w?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m6bwjr/pltr_what_would_you_do/gr6mu7w?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

PLTR is a very very long-term play.  Think a decade or greater into the future.

People expecting big gains this month, or in a year, or even 5 years, probably should stay away.  

Anyone who can't stomach occasional short term share price decreases of 50% should probably stay away. 

IMO, 10+ years is the minimum investment horizon for Palantir."
03/18/2021,stocks,"yes, but with the bond yield going up everyday, stock like pltr will be continue under pressure, it will be better to wait until it settle."
03/18/2021,stocks,"They have 2 DECADES of sustained losses and just now posted their first ever adjust operating income. What on earth makes anyone think that this is a company that's suddenly going to sky rocket?

There is no ""historical."" They've only been public for what, 6 months? 

This is speculation. Pure and Simple."
03/18/2021,stocks,Tired of seeing pltr everywhere like it is the only stock left in the entire market.
03/18/2021,stocks,Pick 👛👜👝🛍🎒
03/18/2021,stocks,IMO PLTR has a potential to become the next tech giant. I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes another trillion dollar company over the next 10-15 years
03/18/2021,stocks,This is a no substance post.
03/18/2021,stocks,God sake with the Plantir shills... bloody popping up everywhere
03/18/2021,stocks,"What a stupid fucking thread. PLTR IPO'ed like 5 months ago, during one of nasdaqs greatest bull runs, and your dd is that ""muhh historically it has hovered around 26/share"". Fucking ridiculous."
03/18/2021,stocks,If you're buying multiplies of 100 anyway that 4/30 $24 CSP looks pretty nice. 2.40 premium so if you get assigned would be $21.60 basis
03/18/2021,stocks,"Not sure. Fair value is now $24. Current price is $23.98. It already looks fair valued. But the low for the past year was $8.90 and the high $45. Maybe it will run, again? Too much of a gamble for me."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Can you have a successful business without palantir tho?

Feel like this is enough for this company to boom if you hold long term. We always say it's not what you know but who you know. They'll be fed gov contracts without an issue imo and will pick up private sector contracts along the way."

03/18/2021,stocks,I'm very long on PLTR I think its a steal. I actually bought 100 more at 24.50 today.  Ive just been selling OTM weekly CC's and selling cash covered puts since I'll buy it at any price under $25 so I try to stay winning with IVS
03/18/2021,stocks,"You know what, Palantir CEO Karp looks like an absolutely crazy basement dwelling incel scientist and thats why i like this stock. Will hold long term."
03/18/2021,stocks,"PLTR will never be above 30 again, and I say this as a bag holder that got in at 35"
03/18/2021,stocks,The risk is that Karp comes out and says he doesn't care about short term share price and people should not invest for the short term. Price then tanks.
03/18/2021,stocks,"The software sells itself. It can save huge companies a lot of money/ increase profitability. The fact that Amazon, IBM, Rio Tinto, Government, BP and more and more companies are using it is testament to its value."
03/18/2021,stocks,I bought PLTR at 18.50 and sold at 29 and then bought back in at 23 and sold 26.73 a couple days ago. It's a good stock to jump in and out but I don't think I would hold it for years!
03/18/2021,stocks,I bought it at 28 heres hoping
03/18/2021,stocks,blackberry
03/18/2021,stocks,They're a good buy under $22 IMO. Maybe under $20
03/18/2021,stocks,"I agree. Usually anytime I notice a newish stock hovering in a specific range for a while, it immediately finds a new place to hover.

Add to that the current hyper-sensitivity of all tech stocks to 10-year yields, and I don't think it is safe to assume anything tech has support at a specific level, at least until people are convinced yields have stabilized."

03/18/2021,stocks,"TSLA under 300 ended up being a ""good steal"", even though the stock went nowhere for the 2nd half of the 2010's.  Anyone who bought shares back then and held on, has got bags of wealth now."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Well right now, a bag holder is probably someone over 30 average. Right now, they're down, but give it a year or so, and I doubt they'll be bag holders anymore. This is more for people who are trying to time the dip that may never come. Buying within this range just means you'll have plenty of opportunities to sell your shares if you see a stock you like more. Of course, if you buy at 24, you're much better off than the guy who bought at 26, but both positions are pretty safe to hold for the long run."
03/18/2021,stocks,I'm a PLTR holder and his argument is just making me want to sell.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm not trying to convince you to buy shares, I probably shouldn't have given my outlook on PLTR, but rather I'm saying if you believe in PLTR, and you want to get in, the best thing you can do is try buy your first batch of shares within this range. From there, just average down. If there's some good news that really benefits PLTR, then of course averaging up is best, but averaging down will put you in a better position in the long run."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Wtf, your argument is even less convincing if all you say is that you’re not convinced."
03/18/2021,stocks,">Why under 26 specifically?

OP has $27 calls. Its not a reason, but might give an idea for that specific price point."
03/18/2021,stocks,Redditors love PLTR. I wouldn't think too much of it.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Well historically, the price of PLTR has offered many buying points within this range. Yes, there have been occasions where its dropped below this, but it has been fairly quick to bounce from these numbers. 24 tends to have a lot of resistance, if it drops below that without any news, the market is probably undergoing a correction, which means there are plenty of other stocks on sale as well."
03/18/2021,stocks,I hope so that I can stock up while it's still under $26
03/18/2021,stocks,Username checks out lmao
03/18/2021,stocks,"New to stocks here. If there isn’t much expected gain in the stocks for 5+ years, wouldn’t it make more sense to put that money into something stable but with growth like Apple/MS/Amazon which will likely provide more return in that period, then slowly start moving shares from there into PLTR in 5-10 years when there’s likely to be more growth?

I’m wondering the value of going in early on looooong plays from an opportunity cost perspective."
03/18/2021,stocks,Bond yield talk is starting to feel overblown to me. Everyone and their mother is saying stay away from bonds for the next year. Bonds are crazy oversold. It's going to start to tempt foreign investors soon and YCC will install a floor to how far they can fall. The inflation fears will prove unfounded at some point. I initiated a very small speculative bet going long on TLT today as I think a reversion back to something more reasonable is likely (very low conviction move tho).
03/18/2021,stocks,"Ya, of course you can wait until things settle, but I guarantee a lot of others are in the same boat as you. The best time you can buy is when fear is at its peak. The issue is that its very hard to time that right, as you seen with the correction that we went through only a week or so ago. It dropped very quickly, there were no signs of stopping, and then suddenly it just did. I feel like PLTR has just as much strength to withstand major losses after a crash, but without any good news, its just a strong at withstanding a bull run that every other stock is loving."
03/18/2021,stocks,">They have 2 DECADES of sustained losses and just now posted their first ever adjust operating income. What on earth makes anyone think that this is a company that's suddenly going to sky rocket?

Because Magikarp can evolve into Gyarados: [https://youtu.be/cnyab-dU\_zU](https://youtu.be/cnyab-dU_zU)

Many people say that PLTR is ""the worst"" investment (like Magikarp is the worst Pokémon)  because Palantir has been unprofitable for nearly 20 years.  However, the company has developed an impressive software platform that may finally make them a tremendous business success in the next decade.  

The seemingly useless fish may become a Powerful Sea Dragon.  Of course, there are no guarantees.  I totally agree that PLTR is a very high risk investment."
03/18/2021,stocks,“Speculation” i thought people in r/stocks know ab companys their commenting on

03/18/2021,stocks,I’ve been selling CSPs on CRSR but PLTR was my next pick for sure. The volatility offers some great premiums.

03/18/2021,stocks,"> No wonder they caught bin laden.

Holup, *they were behind finding bin laden?*"
03/18/2021,stocks,Yeah I’m buying pltr mostly cause I can’t fathom betting against the cia and American military industrial complex.
03/18/2021,stocks,I’m not sure why you are being downvoted. There is a reason many firms still have a price target on this one in the teens. They may have a bright future but the valuation is absurd.
03/18/2021,stocks,"You'll never be able to buy a good company at a fair value. Amazon, facebook, tesla, google and so on were all trading at high valuations relative to their revenue when they were newly IPO companies."

03/18/2021,stocks,Yee Im long PLTR myself but his post just seemed like a bunch of nonsense. Buy share at x price because its lower than price y and will likely go to price z based on my intuition.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Edit: Re-reading the OP, you're not even comparing prices. You're literally just saying $24-$26 is a good price to buy with no reasoning at all.

Your DD literally only involves comparing its current price to historical prices. No mention of its business model, technology, future, competition, financials, or even what the company does. If it were that easy, everybody would be billionaires by now."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I think they have a demo day some time in April. There's no harm in having a couple shares on hand before then. I highly doubt the demo day will go poorly, but worst case scenario, it just ends up trading sideways, or the market crashes, in which case you'll have much more to worry about than demo day."
03/18/2021,stocks,">wouldn’t it make more sense to put that money into something stable but with growth like Apple/MS/Amazon which will likely provide more return in that period, then slowly start moving shares from there into PLTR in 5-10 years when there’s likely to be more growth?

The chief obstacle to this strategy is that it's difficult to know exactly when a risky stock might drastically increase in value. 

At what point does one decide that AAPL's projected growth is going to trail PLTR's?  It's easy to miss a period of exponential stock value appreciation once a number of investors see information that leads them to conclude that the company is now worth a lot more than the consensus. 

There may be tax considerations as well.  Outside of IRAs and other tax-advantaged accounts, there may be taxes on capital gains.  If one has to sell AAPL stock and pay taxes before buying PLTR, that places drag on overall growth rate.  Whereas buying and holding PLTR stock would incur no taxes until the shareholder sells PLTR."

Apart from the fact that you're talking about Pokemon.....

They've had 20 years of lucrative government contracts with a supposedly groundbreaking product.

Yet here we are. The fact that they're still in business is astounding enough."
03/18/2021,stocks,Then wait until they become a tremendous business to invest. No need to gamble and worry about missed returns. If you invested in solid companies like any of FAANG in the last 5 years you would have profited. If a company is a gem now (because of expected growth) while having only lost money then they’ll be a gem when they actually show some profit.

That said, i think the true lesson everyone can agree on is no one knows wtf is going to happen (especially with speculative stocks) in a few years. So my advice is to just put some money into them and never look at them again until you hear everyone talking about how the stock has fucking mooned or crashed. Basically i dont recommend going all in but at the same time not having a position is equally as “bad” because losses due to not acting on something is very real."
03/18/2021,stocks,"5 years ago, I think most investors believed that TSLA was overpriced and not going anywhere.  Tesla spent the 2010's developing battery technology, manufacturing techniques, software, custom silicon, and much more.  All the groundwork and the hiring of tens of thousands of employees didn't begin to show consistent financial benefits until the last half of 2019.  

Palantir is sort of in the same situation.  They've invested nearly 2 decades and a lot of investor capital into developing their software platform.  Last year's financial results hint that their business model could be viable and very successful in the long run, although they aren't there yet. 

My basic argument: even if a company's financials look poor, look at what they've built, and consider the long term possibilities.  I think Palantir has built something with a lot of potential.  Is it risky?  Absolutely.  But their product is unique in its capabilities and ease of deployment.  As an institution, Palantir has smart, ambitious, and mission driven people at its core.  To me, the potential rewards are worth the risk."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Take a look at my reply to FredTheDentist's comment just above.  Palantir is vastly different from Tesla as a business, but they do share similarities in terms of having spent many years and large amounts of money developing their core products.  

The problems that both companies work on are inherently difficult to solve, and required much expenditure before beginning to show financial benefit."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Judging from historical prices is not a perfect strategy, but it is pretty consistent at times when there's no new news on a company. If PLTR were to come out tomorrow and say that they messed up their accounting as PLUG did, then ya, there's going to be a nosedive, in the same way that if they were to say they've cured cancer, it's going to rocket. 24 to 26 has been a range that has offered many selling points, but even then, that range could be extended even closer to 27. This post was more aimed towards people who want to buy PLTR, but aren't sure where the price will go."
03/18/2021,stocks,Lmao people are just mass downvoting anything you say. People need to chill.
03/18/2021,stocks,"i dont think demo day would do much, maybe do a temp spike. it will likely remain flat for a few years.

which is ok. because long invesmtent is call hodl"
03/18/2021,stocks,How exciting can a demo day be? Just clicking some buttons on a computer probably.
03/18/2021,stocks,"These are great points, thanks for the insight"
03/18/2021,stocks,You can actually.
03/18/2021,stocks,"It’ll be higher for sure, it won’t be as big of a deal nor have as much of impact in the long term health of the market as people are making it out to be."
03/18/2021,stocks,You can when demand contracted by as much as it did.
03/18/2021,stocks,When traders are throwing themselves out of office windows. :-)
03/18/2021,stocks,"From observing various investing forums over the years, the point of ""peak fear"" tends to be when people start posting that they've been margin called."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You don't. There's no good way to predict when fear is at its peak. Right now, there's definitely a lot of worrying surrounding bond rates, but who knows what will happen. This could all blow over by next week. Best thing you can do is look at where the last correction ended, see how it reacts as it gets closer to it. If it pushes below it, maybe set a trailing stop buy order. There's no good way to know when to buy really."
03/18/2021,stocks,This... This is the stuff I signed up for.
03/18/2021,stocks,"The product has only started to reach maturity in the past few years.  In 2003 Palantir was starting from nothing, and it’s taken a lot of time to go through many iterations of their platform.  The problem of coalescing vast amounts of disparate, disorganized, and siloed data into a comprehensible model that can be used to make  informed decisions, is a very difficult one to solve. 

The overall number and dollar amount of contracts has also been modest until 2019-2020.  

My Pokémon analogy is just for fun.  It is silly.  But I think it really is the basic case for PLTR: something apparently useless has a chance at evolution into a powerful, valuable business."
03/18/2021,stocks,"My investment strategy is to identify high potential businesses relatively early and buy shares for 10-15 year growth periods.  

AAPL was around 25-30/share 5 years ago.  But it was 3-4/share in 2007 around the time of the original iPhone reveal. 

The difference between a 4x return and a 30x return is substantial. 

There’s obviously less risk buying in when the company has become a surer bet. 

The profit is also much less when buying in later. 

I take on risk, but only on a small number of stocks where I have high conviction.  

I also invest some in index ETFs as a backup, in case I’m wrong on my stock picks."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I know how the tech works, it's not something joe blow just goes out and buys. PLTR serves mostly Govt and huge MNCs which is good for a floor but in terms of growing to a trillion dollar company? 

I own PLTR shares btw but people on reddit seem to not understand how it even works."
03/18/2021,stocks,Lmao take your own advice bud. ‘Trillion dollar cap’ 🤦🏻‍♂️
03/18/2021,stocks,"I’m not saying this post is good. It’s useless I agree, and I’m in PLTR. But this is like 90% of this subreddit lol."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Nature of the game. A stock gains traction, people jump aboard, think it’s going to rise up forever instead of consolidate or pull back to a reasonable valuation. 

Personally I like PLTR and would like to invest but I wouldn’t touch it unless it hits about half its current valuation and even that would be pushing it."
03/18/2021,stocks,"The flip side with PLTR is that it's popularity as a meme stock might mean the prices are over inflated for the next year or so and might not drop down to a fair price. Hopefully I'm wrong, but I'm buying it ""cheap"" now then assuming I'll see red for the next 2 years."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You can throw around the word bubble all you'd like, I've seen people say that since June. Scared money makes no money. Valuations might be high now, but that's because brokers have brought around lower/free commissions, and more people have been brought to the stock market. With more people comes more money, and with covid still happening, expecting a good P/E report would be crazy at this point in time. If, however, in 2 years time, P/E is still high, then there's a huge issue, but right now, I'm not concerned."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yup but the difference is FB and google have turned into mature tech companies so the growth curve for their revenue flattens overtime. PLTR has orders of magnitude more potential for growth compared to FB and google at this point.

I remember arguing over and over again to people back in the day about how TSLA was overvalued at $50/share. Back then they were getting EV production credits from other automakers which is what I thought was going to cause them to collapse. What I missed was that Tesla had a huge fan base with their vehicles and everyone who drove the model S loved it."
03/18/2021,stocks,Yup and and overvalued investment can become more overvalued so it really goes both ways. PLTR has 1B revenue and 41x revenue valuable but it could also go to 5B revenue and still be at 41x revenue valuation.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yes, I know that but the point is still there. I said the exact same thing years ago about google, facebook, tesla etc. - overvalued bubble tech stocks . You have to look at the growth rate and really understand the potential of the technology to get comfortable with it."
03/18/2021,stocks,What are your shorts then?
03/18/2021,stocks,Ive learned a 30% portfolio loss lesson on confirmation bias lmao. Never ever again.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Making long term decisions on a company that IPOed less than a year ago, under the assumption that no news comes out seems naive at best."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I don't really care about internet points. I say what I think, if people disagree, that's why the downvote button is there."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Sure, glad I could help"
03/18/2021,stocks,...even if demand goes back to 100% what it was pre pandemic it doesn't change how much money was injected into the economy artificially through stimulus. =Inflation.
03/18/2021,stocks,"The valuation of AAPL back then doesn't compare to PLTR's right now. I agree with your strategy. But PLTR is priced to perfection. At most, I see it as SNOW multiples. 

For something AAPL like today, look at boring old GM. That's got the makings of a legacy turnaround story"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I also own PLTR but I don't see it become a trillion dollar company either. Salesforce, for example, has completely changed how companies manage the sales cycle and track communication with customers. Completely changed the game. Yet it's still going to be a while if they ever hit the 4 comma club. 

Will data analytics be as large as customer relationship management? Will Palantir be the Salesforce of data analytics and business intelligence? Only time will tell."
03/18/2021,stocks,"palantirs products can be applied to every company on earth, companies not using pltr’s products will be getting bent over, once a company uses pltr’s products their competition will be forced to follow along"
03/18/2021,stocks,"If PLTR somehow manages to develop into something like Skynet from Terminator, then it can be a trillion dollar company."
03/18/2021,stocks,">I know how the tech works, it's not something joe blow just goes out and  buys. PLTR serves mostly Govt and huge MNCs which is good for a floor  but in terms of growing to a trillion dollar company?

You mean the government and huge MNCs that serve joe blow? Palantir doesn't need to sell directly to them to scale... I wasn't the one that said trillion, but it will take off.

Edit: I read your comment history. How does the ""tech work"" exactly?"
03/18/2021,stocks,Quite a few of their contracts involve classified matters.
03/18/2021,stocks,I agree. I put a GTC limit order in for 100 shares at $12 as part of a remind me bet w another guy who thinks a dip to $24 is a good “value”. I’ll keep renewing the order if it doesn’t get executed in 60 days.
03/18/2021,stocks,Lol. No one said PE. It’s PS is 41 x. It has no earnings. Also dumb money makes no money.
03/18/2021,stocks,"You can justify a 41 PE, maybe 50 not a 41x revenue multiple. Not with long rates rising....see dot com bubble. Even Amazon crashed back then. It’s a different company now."
03/18/2021,stocks,Do you know how many times NFLX dropped 40% or more from 2008 to 2018? I believe it was 5x. About once every 2 years. I researched it. You buy strong conviction growth stocks when they dip HARD. Not at extreme multiples.
03/18/2021,stocks,I don’t short. It’s hard to get timing and carry costs will kill you. I wait. Bought NFLX and ROKU when they crashed hard at end of 2018 and made a killing but sold too soon.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Same man I used to go on stocktwits to look at the stocks I own but usually everyone's just pumping, confirming biases, or being an annoying bear."
03/18/2021,stocks,"it also doesn't change the reduced demand and production throughout the pandemic unless it goes to 110%. 10yr inflation is not going to be over 3% yoy. We may hit that from Jun21-Jun22 which I foresee as the period of the largest ghost inflation when the economy rebounds.

Serious forecasters also do not forsee much above the 2% target for the next 10 years. https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/real-time-data-research/inflation-forecasts"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I agree, though the reason why I bought PLTR is I like Alex Karp, the company's no bs attitude and I think the scope for data analysis is potentially infinite. We're only just getting started with creating an IoT and soon it'll be hard to find applications for something like PLTR's products. I think it's important to play it long and realize this isn't some Apple or Tesla that some on reddit seem to think."
03/18/2021,stocks,And again I ask you: how? You haven't said any reason why this company will grow to the size of an Apple or Amazon
03/18/2021,stocks,"A lot of their money has been put into research, the majority of their operating income came from Q3 and their revenue increased each quarter. People are not buying PLTR for their current performance, but once things are back to normal, I'll re-evaluate my position on PLTR"
03/18/2021,stocks,PLTR is currently in a dip I would argue.
03/18/2021,stocks,I think the company has potential. The stock is disconnected from fundamentals. Also the CEO recently sold most of his stock. That’s not a sign of confidence. I have a GTC limit order at $12. At the right price I’ll take a gamble.
03/18/2021,stocks,IMO not a big enough dip if still at 41x sales and still not GAAP profitable. Could fall another 50% if yields keep climbing.
03/18/2021,stocks,"!remindme 1 year

03/18/2021,stocks,I will put a limit order in for PLTR at $12 and keep renewing it until it exercises. We can than talk in a year.

03/18/2021,stocks,fair enough
03/18/2021,stocks,"I would urge caution.

VW is already one of the world's biggest auto manufactures.  It is not possible for VW to grow very much more due to this.  I think the auto industry itself is only forecasted to grow about 3%.

If you bid up the price of VW, I believe it can only end in disaster.

This is honestly a foreshadowing of the entire EV dilemma.  It's just not like technology companies in the 90s / early 2000s.

People and businesses already own cars.  They don't really need more cars.  Sure - EV is a great technology and I am glad it is also environmentally friendly.  However, the world is not going from zero cars to a massive market of EV cars.

In the tech boom, the world changed and became more efficient.  Companies went from owning no computers to hundreds of computers and this dramatically improved the efficiency of their business.  And despite all of this, the market still bubbled and crashed.

EV just can not deliver this type of efficiency.  Everyone is still going to own more or less the same amount of cars.  Everyone is still going to commute and be stuck in traffic jams.

I just don't see it - outside of a few spectacular companies who will provide the world with innovations in batteries (which the world seriously needs.  batteries have been stagnate for a long time now) - and maybe a few mining companies sitting on top of massive lithium deposits."
03/18/2021,stocks,"What people often don't see with VW:

* VW has the third largest R&D expenditure of all companies world wide after Amazon and Alphabet ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_by_research_and_development_spending)), ~10x that of Tesla.

* VW is by far the market leader in the worlds biggest and still growing car market (China). They started investing there in the 70s and have a market share of 15%, twice as much as the next competitor.

* VW's main competitor, Toyota, is the company which is behind the most in EV space (and also software) which means that there is a lot of market share to aquire from them.

* VW has the strongest battery contracts (>5 different vendors) and the highest battery order volume of the whole industry."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I dont know why car companies will suddenly become more valuable just because they sell electric instead of diesel.  

tesla can at least make the case because people call it more than a car company."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I think Ford could emerge as kind of a dark horse too. Their trucks are still pretty popular, same with mustangs... could see them reinventing themselves a little during the transition a bit as well."
03/18/2021,stocks,didn’t VW scam the world with that diesel emissions scandal
03/18/2021,stocks,"porsche holdings is a better way to play vw stock though, right?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Good discussion about Tesla, ARK, and VW.

https://open.spotify.com/episode/6dSbiFxz3vetDfbYvLldC7?si=43pSDxwTRcu6th0HxYEAJQ"
03/18/2021,stocks,"All traditional car companies are gonna get in on the EVs ASAP.  I would argue that it’s just going to be the status quo, but with more competition as a few of these EV brands are likely to break out, whereas outside Tesla there hasn’t been any completion in the auto industry since 2000 or so when Kia/Hyundai came on the scene"
03/18/2021,stocks,"European market is expected to adopt EV's the fastest and VW is a major player here. VW is way undervalued compared to Tesla when viewed purely as electric car maker. Yes , TESLA is expected to win EV race and Tesla is not just a car maker. I am more comfortable in owning VW than something like NIO or XPENG. They are way ahead in EV game than someone like GM or Ford. Their CEO is following the TESLA playbook in PR of late and it is paying off in stock price."
03/18/2021,stocks,I'm not a car person but that E-tron GT looks slick. Not exactly a steal at 100k+ though.
03/18/2021,stocks,Vw long range is best
03/18/2021,stocks,"Elon likes going to the basics, so he invested in battery technology (""acquired"" from Panasonic).

However, VW is thinking long term - they secured mineral rights for a long time, basically the raw material (lithium, etc.) used to make batteries.

Even if Tesla claims (and actually has) a better motor and electronics, you are comparing an EV drive system that is probably 5-10% more efficient as of today in favor of Tesla. So maybe Tesla can do 5-10% more miles today for the same battery (the same amount of minerals).

VW will catch up in overall system efficiency of the device (the car), but what they have today is a better business efficiency (by grabbing mineral rights/leases). If  they control the raw material, they control the overall cost of the product, and having the ability to acquire minerals for 10% less per car easily makes up for the device inefficiency (as of today)."
03/18/2021,stocks,BMW. All about the brand and engineering.
03/18/2021,stocks,Least volatile play and best choice of all legacy OEMs. They may be the only legacy ICE manufacturer to survive the next decade due to the great work they are putting in now to capture present and future EV markets.
03/18/2021,stocks,BMW
03/18/2021,stocks,"I don’t have a horse in this race because my strategy is investing in the companies producing required EV materials, but if I had to pick a car manufacturer I would pick GM.  What they are doing with their own EV lineup, + BrightDrop + their autonomous driving subsidiary Cruise is setting them up for big moves in the future."
03/18/2021,stocks,"EVs are going to be mainstream at some point, pretty much everyone agrees with this.

Whenever there is a major shift like this in a complex industry, the incumbents typically suffer. It will be difficult to determine the ultimate winners here and a lot of market cap is going to be destroyed.

Just think about the smartphone revolution. Trying to guess who would succeed back in 2007 would be a crap shoot."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I don't know about ""by far"". There are several other strong and safe EV plays out there, Toyota is one example."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Here is my concern. 

Every car manufacturer seems to have a weak point; sometimes it's transmission, sometimes it's the steering. And the ""old/traditional"" Wolkswagen's weakest point is... hm, the electrical system... This just makes me wonder if they truly mastered this finally, or whether their electric car will have more issues than we now think. (Source: family member working with cars; we had a Jetta.)"
03/18/2021,stocks,Ticker symbol?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Agree with this, its the issue with all the existing manufacturers - EV sales just end up cannibalising their existing sales rather than adding growth.

I do think VW can do well out of this but theres only so much extra they can grow whilst remaining purely a car manufacturer."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Great point of view, I have to think about that a bit longer!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"> It is not possible for VW to grow very much more due to this.

In my opinion it still is. Because VW now has a very unique chance to steal market share from their biggest competitor, Toyota."
03/18/2021,stocks,If NIO holders could read they would be very upset right now
03/18/2021,stocks,"Counter point on chasing Toyota.  All these pivots to EV from other companies mean that if non EV demand remains strong for the next 10 years, you have many companies fighting for a smaller EV market share and they have vacated their traditional ICE market share to Toyota who can make gobs of money for the next 5 years.  

Then they can find one of the smaller survivors of the EV rush and just buy a proven winner and absorb them.

First to market is not always important, and in this I think the is value to do the exact opposite of VW and instead follow Toyota’s path instead."
03/18/2021,stocks,">I dont know why car companies will suddenly become more valuable just because they sell electric instead of diesel. 

Mid to longer term VW will eat the lunch of its strongest competitors (mainly Toyota) thanks to its early and well executed shift. Also EVs are a great opportunity for quick cost reductions (higher margins) because longterm they are much simpler."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Me neither, but the market values it that way."
03/18/2021,stocks,Because the EV market hasn't even come close to taking off. Companies like VW are poised to tap into a large chunk of the EV market that they no company was really capitalizing on. Everyone is expecting growth.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I mean in France Renault is selling EV to the public for few years now, it doesn't make them the best"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I am really impressed by the mach E to be honest. And it digs away market share from Tesla in the US really fast. So it seems like a legit product people would buy."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Ford is positioning themselves to be a car share / tech company.  I don't know how long that will take, but they've announced subscription pricing for their self driving tech. and said they are planning on a future with fewer car sales.

I think that makes sense and I can see Ford doubling their share price if it comes true. Although, I don't plan on holding Ford long enough to find out."
03/18/2021,stocks,Everyone was. Epa allowed defeat devices. Vw was the Lance Armstrong of it
03/18/2021,stocks,They did. Which was the best thing they could have done because their penalty/fine forced them to start investing in EV. So they are way ahead of others.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Their announcements are always great, but that's about it.  
They fucked their customers a couple of times and I guess they would do it again, cause in the end, it didn't hurt them much.  
I might be wrong, but I just can not trust this company."
03/18/2021,stocks,you ask like you don't already know
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yes, but it probably doesn't really matter. Obviously the stock market tends to be forward-looking rather than backward-looking."
03/18/2021,stocks,"idk tbh, but you will be just fine with the normal VW stock I guess"
03/18/2021,stocks,As a bet on the premium segment?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Well, I think all current ice carmakers are gonna survive the next 10 years; EVs will just have a market share of 18% in 2030 according to BCG. So no troubles for them."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I don't think Toyota is going to lose ground, tesla, definitely though"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Not to dispute any of the forecast as I do think phasing out ICE is a decade or longer ambition.

But I think first to market has long passed. Tesla made EV mainstream and now Ford, GM, VW are pivoting.  I can't imagine Toyota doing any different they just may be less public about their plans."
03/18/2021,stocks,"VW will still make ICE cars as well but it will be increasingly difficult to compete in price for them especially when there are government incentives ""more generous than the current $7,500 federal EV tax credit"" (Schumer). Toyota may have surrendered the US market to VW this time by missing the train. Their desperate trials to lobby (https://electrek.co/2021/03/17/toyota-lobbies-us-government-delusional-effort-slow-down-electric-vehicles/) show that they are scared."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Theoretically they should provide higher margins, but assuming the industry maintains an incredibly high level of competition the margins could easily be driven  back down by decreasing price."
03/18/2021,stocks,Idk about the toyota part... I agreed with everything else tho
03/18/2021,stocks,"Nobody knows what Toyota has up its sleeve. In my opinion, the ultimate winner will be whoever can perfect the next generation of battery first. VW is a great company but let’s not forget they are capable of big blunders like dieselgate."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Meanwhile, as everyone pivots to the EV fad, they are giving up market share in the still very very dominant ICE market.  So Toyota will sell more cars than before by not doing this early switch, and can imitate those which have success and do their switch in 5 years.

I’d follow Toyota’s strategy all day long than push into the cramped EV space just to be “first mover” with all the capital degradation and mistakes to fight througg"
03/18/2021,stocks,Where are you getting that the market values it that way? VW didn't suddenly become a tech company working on an advanced neural network. VW owns famous car brands and is trying to make half decent electric vehicles.
03/18/2021,stocks,so true
03/18/2021,stocks,"EPA did not ""allow"" defeat devices"
03/18/2021,stocks,what’s stopping them from doing it again?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yup. I haven't looked at their entire prospective EV line but their ICE cars are actually pretty affordable for luxury vehicles and BMW scales really well. I imagine that they'll capture a lot of the market based on brand alone in addition to how well they engineer vehicles. I see i3s and i8s commonly but sales of both have declined since 2017. Fwiw I started adding bmw in 2019/2020 so I am a bit biased because I like the brand and company, but just another option to discuss."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Given price parity and EV incentives I highly doubt that we only see 18% of new Auto sales being EVs in 2030. That would be extremely low, especially given the planned capacity EVs manufactures will be producing then compared to the amount of Vehicles produced on average per year. By 2025 there will be essentially no reason *price wise* for the average person to want to buy an ICE veh, the problem will be supply constraints.

The debt saddled ones will fall first. Save by mergers or acquisitions will be the only way they will still be around in 10 years, set a RemindMe"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Sales are still less than 5% of total market.  We are still in the very very early stages.  Once that hits 25%, then is when I expect someone like Toyota to firm their plan to change over.  Meanwhile, those other car makers are vacating that 95% market early, even if it is shrinking and Toyota is poised to take that market share even if it only lasts 5 years or so"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Oh it’s a risky decision, don’t get me wrong, but it’s risky for any company on “when” to make this switch.

Say inflation runs away and the government is seized by a huge debt crisis or longer recession.  Will the government still be providing free money for 15% of a vehicles cost?  Yes it’s attractive now, but if that fell off EV margins could look very weak. Especially in the face of their higher capital costs to make the switch, and the mistakes/learnings they have along the way."
03/18/2021,stocks,">Where are you getting that the market values it that way?

From the stock price? Working on an self proclaimed ""advanced neural network"" for level 5 self-driving cars has absolutely zero value until it actually works.

03/18/2021,stocks,"It's gotta be something  revolutionary.  AMZN was a complete game changer and people didn't even see the potential.  I don't even think Bezos saw the potential until much later on.  When he started AMZN he didn't think that he was going to get into cloud hosting or game streaming or developing own movies.  Like NFLX, there was potential, but I don't think people saw it as a original content company when it first started mailing DVDs.  

So maybe TSLA is a decent option.  The upside isn't that they are going to be just selling cars.  What is the potential that we are not seeing today?  They are doing solar, maybe self driving cars, software, batteries, energy.  What else could that lead to?  Maybe quite a bit.  20 years from now we may be saying TSLA at $700 was a steal!  Honestly I don't know.  I don't own shares and don't plan to.

Also agree anything blockchain could be interesting, but again who knows.  I own some crypto currencies, but that's it for now, still hunting for different opportunities.

I think gene editing and therapies could be just massive.  I own some CRSP and have looked at others.

Space travel?  

Self driving cars and/or car sharing.  The big idea, if all cars are self driving would you ever need to actually own a car?  It would really only be for driving for pleasure and maybe vanity.  But if all cars are self driving then you just call a shared car or uber/taxi to your house/apt at an appointed time and it takes you wherever you need to go.  

Maybe VR?

03/18/2021,stocks,">It's gotta be something  revolutionary.

My bet would be on Genomics.  

Tech companies like Apple and Amazon are basically the ""Blue Chips"" of today: the ones who made it big and have steady operations.  Tesla was that ""revolutionary"" pick in the 2010s.  I think they've still got a ways to grow, maybe 3-5x if they can keep growing into a mature business like Apple by 2030. 

Genomics is still the Wild West.  There's a hint of the potential with early gene editing therapies (like CRISPR-based sickle cell cures), personalized genetic diagnosis, and the technology behind some COVID vaccines.  I think the potential of the tech is still not even close to fully tapped, or understood.  Remember that in the 60's and 70's, few if any people could have foreseen how computers would make the current Internet age possible.  

The problem is that because Genomics is still relatively new as an industry, it's going to be extremely difficult to pick winners.  

Locking away a bunch of ARKG shares for 10-15 years might be one possible solution.  Given the volatility, this is definitely not an ETF for anyone who isn't willing to weather a lot of short term unrealized loss."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Agree and I don't necessarily think it will be something that is solely for consumers and might go towards AR/VR for companies / corporations like mechanics, electrical engineers, architects,  designers, etc - I wish Oculus wasn't owned by FB and was a public company I would buy their stuff which blows but just can't get behind it. Especially with them now forcing people to have a FB app. For VR we are just not quite there yet which sucks probably another 4 - 5 years easy. Same with AI it's tough to pick a real winner because you have companies like IBM, Apple, Amazon, create it so it very well might be something that is added to one of them.

It's one of the things that probably goes with the later of my first post in that the company probably doesn't exist yet. I'm big on $BEAM though and like CRISPR too a lot.

I’d say to improve your picks. GME is basically a pure gamble, especially when you get in where it is right now. I don’t know much about EA, but it’s important to ask yourself what makes you think the stock will grow. Do they have big releases coming up? Are their earnings up? Are they managing debt well and reinvesting to grow their business? Is there new and promising leadership? Is the sector undervalued? Is the stock undervalued?

I don’t think it’s so much that you’ve made extremely bad decisions, but rather bad picks based perhaps on personal enthusiasm (like maybe you’re a gamer, for example).

EA has gone up a lot over the past several years and I know they’ve done a ton of acquisitions, but do they have a specific product roadmap for 2021 that made you optimistic on them exceeding their 2018 ATH? I’m not asking to mock you, just more offering that these are questions to ask yourself before investing."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Ok just looked this up, and yeah, that’s what I try to do"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I appreciate the time you took to respond back!

Usually I try to be as cautious as possible investing, and I followed EA ever since their dip in 2018. After taking a few hits to their image and reputation, they did put quite a bit of work to fix their reputation and company value. Scaling back down on some of their business practises, making games players are interested in, fixing their reputation with investors and a few other factors make them a promising investment, if everything goes right of course.

Some big, widely awaited games are coming out this year, and EA appears to try not to mess up this time. Investing in what interests me isn’t a good idea, I don’t care about most companies, but in the eyes of an investor, EA is a prospect to keep an eye on for long term.

But I’m not an expert, or have much experience, but I try and learn from mistakes."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You’re right, I am going to be more cautious moving forward."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Sold Gamestop, and now focused on EA. I’ve been following them for a while, so hopefully by the end of the year they will grow."

03/18/2021,stocks,"it is really difficult to be honest with you. I have my personal laptop right by my work laptop and always have limit orders going. The plus side is that I don't have to trigger the sale but the downside is that might sell early. 

Sometimes it takes days/weeks for me to break even again. There are other times that I don't see the point of waiting for it to go back up and I cut my losses."
03/18/2021,stocks,"1. i am biased of GME because i own it. i believe there is a high chance of high proffit short squeeze. i you are afraid of your money, meme stocks are the worst place to put it, as there is the highest uncertainty. 
2. if you have your dd on which you base your decisions on, you can pretty much ignore the fud or fomo because there will always be those who will want to manipulate with either fear or hype. 
3. i am not a financial advisor, this is my opinion.
4. unless you are day trader don't be impatient. week and month is not long when it comes to holding."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Cool, it sounds like you did some research. EA may just need time to pay off, I don’t know enough about it. GME is a bit more wild and personally I avoid it. I still don’t think you’ve made any consequential series of negative decisions. It sounds like you’re smart and researching. Maybe your problem isn’t a real problem. Everyone makes bad picks, so they hope that the good picks outweigh them. Once you develop a diversified portfolio that you feel confident in, the hardest part is just riding out the dips on the temporary losses and determining when/if they’ll rebound.

I will just say that riding GME can be dangerous and there may be safer investments to be found. Then again, some people have done very well with it."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Also, try to be diverse. Instead of only EA, pick several more investments, maybe some ETFs.  So that when one position isn’t doing well, it won’t affect your portfolio much.  Also, if the stock is down because of the entire market movement, then it’s nothing to worry about."
03/18/2021,stocks,"No need to act more on them, right? Sold Gamestop, and began looking back onto other stocks I was more interested in previously."

2021-03-18 19:44:40,stocks,"Followup to the Stock Scraper Analysis from yesterday (03/17/21) This is in response [to this post from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/)

&#x200B;

I should have expected it but it didn't occur to me until it started happening, but too many people being in the sheet at the same time locked it up to where most people got errors. I was sending out copies of the sheet but with hundreds of DMs it was getting to be too much to keep up with. I'm interested in presenting this in a way that people can access all the want without it locking up, but although I'm an expert with Excel I don't know Python and don't have any experience auto-publishing stuff online. If anyone can help with that let me know!

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, the most common question I got was how I interpret data so I will give examples from today's data below. Keep in mind that none of this is a clear ""buy me!!"" flashing light, it's just how I interpret the data. I've been getting 10% - 15% returns on about 80% of my picks. The indicators convinced me to buy UWMC, ASO, ASRT, RMBL, CVR, SJR, and AMD within the last week. Of all of them the only one I lost money on was RMBL, the rest all sold at a profit.

&#x200B;

So what am I looking at today? Before I go into the criteria, here's what the data has shown my so far. This could change after another few weeks of tracking, but as of right now it says:

1. The social media platform that is the most successful in picking stocks is Reddit
2. Tickers with a Reddit score of 500 or under have been the most likely to go green in the next week
3. The average % return for those categories is 15%
4. The average days until it hits max profit is 6 days

&#x200B;

**All that being said, here's the criteria I look for:**

1. Using Unbias data I copy/paste all the Reddit data for the last 24 hours into my excel sheet
2. From there I filter it down to just items with a score under 500
3. I have a column that calculates the % increase between yesterday and today so I sort it by % return
4. I filter out anything that has already had more than 5% growth. Those aren't necessarily bad buys, I just want the full 15% as often as I can get it
5. I enter each ticker into the Reddit search and manually get rid of anything that isn't a real ticker (sometimes the scraper picks up repeated things that look like tickers but are just phrases)
6. I note any ticker that is being mentioned across at least 4 different subs. I'm looking for stocks that are getting mentioned all over, not just multiple times in 1 sub
7. I filter out anything that looks like it's just bots posting all over the place

&#x200B;

From there I try narrow it down to 3 - 5 that I feel the best about. Keep in mind I'm trading 100% on sentiment, so I don't do any DD on the company itself. My assumption is that if a lot of people are talking about it then they've done all the DD for me, I just have to follow the crowd and jump on the band wagons that are just starting to move. The strategy has worked pretty well, as of today I'm up about 22% since starting this.

&#x200B;

**How do I put it to use?**

1. I spread the money evenly across 3 - 5 of the tickers that just feel the best to me.
2. I hold for no longer than a week. I sell somewhere between 10% and 15%, but if it hits 7 days I sell no matter what. Usually I sell after 5 business days, but sometimes I'll hold a week. If I take a loss I take a loss, but usually I'm up

&#x200B;

So what are my picks today? These are the ones I'm going to look into. I have no idea what will pop and what I'll choose, but these are the ones I'm most curious about based on today's data. I don't know if they're good or not, don't know anything about the companies - only that they fit into the categories that are the most profitable in the spreadsheet

&#x200B;

EDIT: The post was deleted due to mentioning some stocks that it didn't like, [so here's a screenshot of the ones I'll be considering today.](https://imgur.com/gallery/XwhkLWP) Most likely I'm going to throw money evenly across the top 5"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Like others, I'm having trouble finding the same tickers when I check unbias mid-day.  Is that list all from your ""reddit-trending"" strategy, or are some from the ""yesterday's ATH"" category?

I'm also not too thrilled with some of the listings below \~300 on the data.  There will be a bunch in a row which are all just mentioned in some ""daily movers"" post which gets reposted in 4 places... might as well be a news roundup.

Are you filtering out tickers that have been added in the past? so that something hits your list only when it's the first time you've seen it (in that category of reddit score)?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"When you say the top 5. Are you talking about IMLT, CTLT, BIDU..."
03/18/2021,stocks,"On points 3 and 4, when you talk about % do you mean price % or score %? 

Thank you so much man, these posts are EXTREMELY helpful !!"
03/18/2021,stocks,">Usually I sell after 5 business days, but sometimes I'll hold a week.

When you say this, how do you determine where day 1 is? When the ticker hits the 250-500 group?

Great work btw"
03/18/2021,stocks,How do you filter all that like your saying
03/18/2021,stocks,How do you collect the mention data from the social media sites? I assumed you were scraping but your post says you don’t know python (which is what many people use) so I am curious if you have another method/source? I am interested in getting that data regularly but also do not know python.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yep, these ones:
IMTX
CTLT
BIDU
GTBP
ATNF

And I added in AGTC. I didn't check to see where it is on my lists (too many people in the sheet are locking it up) but it's being mentioned quite a bit on Reddit over the last few days"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Price %. My thinking is that if the average max price for that category is, say, 15% then I want to see how much it has already gone up. If it has gone up 12% then I know there isn't a lot of growth left in it (on average). 

Individual stocks may go much higher or lower, of course, but I figure it's a win if I take 10% - 15% each time"
03/18/2021,stocks,The day I enter it into the sheet. That's what I call day 0
03/18/2021,stocks,I copy and paste it all into an excel spreadsheet and filter it through there. The website isn't set up to do a lot of filtering
03/18/2021,stocks,If you follow the link in my previous post you'll get the site. It's called Unbias Stock
03/18/2021,stocks,I just went to Unbiastock and I can't seem to find any of these tickers you mentioned in here. I chose to search all of reddit in 24 hours. Am I doing something wrong or what is happening?

2021-03-18 19:38:09,stocks,"Fidelity zero expense ratio funds - anything I need to be aware of? Hi. I am looking at FZROX (total market) and FZILK (international) to invest 50% of my fidelity taxable brokerage in each (I have more US exposure in my 401k).

Any feedback?  Zero fees makes me a bit suspicious about performance, but I can’t find anything negative that jumps out on me. 

Thank you!!!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I just stated putting money into Fidelity mutual funds a couple months ago, so do your own research....but I looked at the zero expense funds and compared them to the closest non-zero expense match and what I found is that while the zero expense funds are basically ""free"", they don't perform as well. If you look at the expense rate and see 0.03%, but its returns are 0.5% higher than the zero expense fund, then you're better off with the non-expense fund because you'll make more money in the long run.

I researched, and ultimately bought into 4 different mutual funds just to become more familiar with the market. I ended up choosing FSMAX (extended market) and FXAIX (S&P 500 index) and those are the two best performing mutual funds I have."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Interesting. I thought they were not available on some platforms but are available on fidelity. 

It would be so strange because they are relatively new so can’t be that bloated yet.

2021-03-18 19:34:35,stocks,"XPO Logistics moves closer to spin-off with new name, SEC filing XPO disclosed in December that it was spinning off a pair of companies. GXO, which had been provisionally named NewCo, will be the second-largest contract logistics provider in the world. Usage of the new company name, logo and other brand components will become effective upon the completion of the spin-off, expected to take place in the second half of the year.

The other spin-off, provisionally called XPORemainCo, will be a global provider of less-than-truckload (LTL) and truck brokerage transportation services.

XPO Chairman and CEO Brad Jacobs said GXO’s letters “stand for the game-changing opportunities we’re bringing to the table for customers, employees and shareholders, with a nod to our XPO heritage. GXO will take this legacy into the future as an independent public company, with countless ways to deliver logistics at full potential.”

Jacobs said that thanks to years of investment in technology as part of XPO, GXO will be well positioned to capitalize on the logistics industry’s predominant secular tailwinds: The growth in e-commerce and omnichannel retail, fast-growing customer demand for automation and digital capabilities and a shift toward outsourcing supply chain services.

“The new company’s brand identity captures the qualities that make us an industry leader – our ability to deliver faster, leaner, smarter logistics for customers at lower cost, using advanced automation and data science,” said Malcolm Wilson, XPO’s chief executive officer  – Europe, who in January was named to become CEO of GXO. “I’m looking forward to leading our global team to the many new opportunities in our future.”

XPO has filed a confidential initial Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the planned spinoff of its logistics business.

The transaction is subject to various conditions, including the effectiveness of the Form 10 registration statement, receipt of a tax opinion from counsel, the refinancing of XPO’s debt on terms satisfactory to the XPO board of directors, and final approval by the XPO board of directors.

XPO has retained Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC as its financial adviser and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz as its legal adviser to assist with the spinoff process.

2021-03-18 19:16:32,stocks,"Looking for oil/gas opinions to diversify Hey all.

I’m looking to diversify my portfolio a little and interested in potentially using oil and gas as a place to park some money for the divvies in the near long-term. Does anyone out there have experience in the sector and input on current valuations, risk, and opportunity?

I’m mostly interested because it looks like oil and gas never fully recovered from 2019, and I suspect the major players will continue to grow in a lot of EMs and remain a staple here in the US, but of course they spent a couple weeks going up and now they’re coming back down. Does that represent a buying opportunity?

For example on oil, thoughts on CVX vs BP vs XOM vs RDS? I don’t expect dramatic growth or anything, and I’m aware that the sector can take bruises due to scandals/events and that oil is commonly used as an economic proxy war. I’m interested to hear your thoughts on how that plays out for investors as well.

And yeah, I’m well-aware that oil and gas aren’t the future.

Last question: would financials be a smarter hedge to diversify? They’ve seen a big rise lately and I hesitate to buy on the way up."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Far from a expert, but I am bullish on Oil and Gas. I work in the industry as a Project Manager, and think there is room for these companies to run. 

Yes, oil is phasing out as far as its use to propel vehicles in the future, but the amount of plastics and composites that are derived from Oil are not going away anytime soon. Don’t forget that oil has been steadily at 60+ per barrel.

Also, the natural gas demand will increase as oil fall. Understand that a significant amount of our power is from Nat Gas generators. This will not turn to green energy anytime soon. The technology just isn’t there. 

Lastly, I see Oil and Gas companies transitioning to renewables over time. They have the cash, and we are already seeing a shift in their perspective and priorities. 

As far as picks, I’m in Exxon, Chevron, Energy Transfer, Kinder Morgan, NextEra, Enphase, and Two oil and gas ETFs. I got in late last year before the recent surge in prices, and plan on holding at least until these companies reach pre-COVID prices. On a percentage basis, I’ve probably got 30% of my portfolio in Energy. It kept me flat during the recent tech pullback.
Good luck!"

They usually can make pretty good money in up markets and in down markets. I like Phillips 66 (PSX) because they’ve got significant investments in chemicals in addition to refining. Valero (VLO) is also a great option. They’ve been making big investments into biodiesel, ethanol, and other fuel alternatives. The last big player is Marathon (MPC). I’m less familiar with MPC but both PSX and VLO are dividend machines. Both companies are sitting on fat stacks of cash and both companies have incredible management teams. They’re both below pre-Covid highs and should have another 20-30% growth left in them.

As far as upstream companies go I think RDS has been the biggest proponent about diversifying into alternative energy."

I am brand new to investing and I need some advice as to what to invest in (and whether it's the right time to invest) in order to balance my portfolio.

&#x200B;

So far, here is how it is balanced:

Stocks:

13% VOW3 (Volkswagen), 11.8%AMC,10.6% AAPL, 10.6% CRSR,1% ING (Belgian bank), 0.06% AMD

ETFs:

10.5% EQQQ, 8.7% SPYY

Leftover on the side:

33.74%

&#x200B;

It is too tech-heavy and I want to spread it a little bit more, but I feel a bit overwhelmed when looking for good ETFs/stocks to invest in. I plan to hold on the long term, what would be your recommendations?

Now I can only tell you what I think is the best thing and what I'd say if your looking to risk your probably looking for gains in the here and now, and I don't see any of these companies bringing you in great returns for the next year. This kicking that growth is taking is only getting started and its going to ramp up - Just wait till Biden tries to push his infrastructure bill. 

I think this year is going to be relatively flat/low for tech and growth this year from here on out but I think itll be a good year for Fin, Industrials, and Materials.

Let's say I made investment income from short-term capital gains between January 1st and March 31st 2021. No taxes were withheld, so I'm looking into making Estimated Tax Payments.

My questions are:

1. Should I spread my tax payments for those realized gains across the four quarters, or should all tax payments for those gains be made for Q1 (by ~~July 15~~ May 17th for Federal, by April 15 for NC)?
2. Can I file my 2020 tax return before March 31st without adding my 2021 Q1 estimated tax payment, and then make estimated my tax payments afterward?

Thank you."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I don’t think you gave folks enough info here.  I’d call an tax accountant.  They are worth their weight in goal with regards to paying only what you have to.  

So many questions like did you take losses in the last few years? This same quarter?  Do you day trade? Whats your income? Etc etc etc etc

Also was this a usa stock on a usa exchange? Or s foreign stock on a usa exchange?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Look up the safe harbor rule. Pay/withhold 100% of last year's taxes (110% if your AGI is over $150k), and you won't get penalized. Even so, the penalty is like 3.4% of the underpaid amount. Let's say your marginal bracket is 22%. That's 3.4% of 22% of $50k, so $374 in penalty."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Tax accountant here at a big CPA firm. 

There are 2 ways to pay estimates. First way: 100% of PY tax or 110% if you made more than $150k. You take the total tax, divide by 4, subtract your expected withholding (from say a W-2) earned ratably over the year. That is your estimate. Example: last year your tax bill was $100 and you had $95 of withholding. Your estimate = $100/4 - 95/4 = $1.25. Per quarter. You catch up anything you are short next April. No penalties. 

Second way: pay in 90% of current year tax each quarter as you go. So if you had a bunch of ST realized gains in Q1 you are looking at a big bill paying the tax on all those earnings. You do not get to take into account what you anticipate you may lose on the rest of the year. This can result in you being overpaid. So example: you make 100k in STCG and you are in the 25% tax bracket. Let’s ignore the graduated rates for simplicity sake. You owe 90% of 25k by April 15 this year. Take each quarter as it comes. You measure your quarters like this : April payment based on first 3 months. June payment based on first 5 months. September payment based on first 8 months. January payment based on whole year and don’t be short. 

Good luck. 

Back door way: call HR and hike your tax withholding on your paychecks sky high and hope you got enough in. Not recommended for the novice. 

When in doubt, call your favorite tax CPA."
03/18/2021,stocks,"What I'll say is the federal tax system is a ""pay as you go"" system, meaning that any income you received in a particular quarter you should make an estimated tax payment for since there's no withholding. If you don't pay each quarter and pay all at once (in just one quarter or when you file your return), you run the risk of getting hit with an estimated tax penalty. 

This is all just for the federal taxes. Irs.gov does have information about Estimated Tax payments, and Publication 505 covers it as well. But yeah if you're unsure, would prob be beneficial to have a professional handle it."

I thought that would be fairly simple: I made income from selling stocks this year and money is not withheld, so I need to do some payments. I'm just unclear whether those payments can be spread over the year, or if payment for those Jan1-Mar31 gains has to be done for Q1, and if I can do it after filing my 2020 tax return.

16. **Opera GX** as the **biggest Discord server** in recent history

I wanted to say thanks to u/shortyafter for [his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m7ppir/really_surprised_by_all_the_misinformation_on_here/), were he was talking about how it's wrong to say that stocks have 'no intrinsic value and it's totally abstract and a popularity contest'; but then what is their intrinsic value and how do we decide their value?

Let's start with clarifying what is a share: we can define a share as a small piece of the company, if you own a share, that means you are a co-owner of the company.

So if you want to know what should be the price of a share you have to apply the formula:

price of a share=  market cap/number of share

The number of shares is a public information, but what about the market cap?

The market cap is usually calculated based using the Net Cash Flow of the company, that once again is a public information available in the Financial Statements, the interest rate i, and the growth of the NCF g:

Market Cap= NCF/(i-g)

Now this is really the basic, and sorry if I missed something or used the wrong terms (I did not study this in English), this was just to give an idea that no matter what the market thinks and how popular is a company, if a company is able to produce a positive Cash Flow, it will always have an intrinsic value in the long term.

I am a Financial Advisorn't, and this is not a financial advice."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Market cap is the price people are currently paying to own the company. (Calculated with easily available info like you said)

Intrinsic value is the true underlying value of the company, it could be higher or lower than the market cap. (usually have to figure this out on your own, there is not set formula to get this number)"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Market cap = price * number of shares

03/18/2021,stocks,"There is something called a ""round trip"" trade which you can't do more than 3 times in 5 days if you're not a ""pattern day trader"". A round trip is when you open and close a position within the same trading day. A pattern day trader is someone who does this more than 3 times in 5 trading days. The 4th round trip trade will get you a brokerage freeze in some cases. 

However, what you're describing is not a round trip trade. Whether you can do what you're describing depends on whether or not you have a margin account or enough cash for the transaction. If you do, closing a position in a stock or reducing your position and then adding to or re-opening a position is not a round trip, nor is it a good faith violation. If you do not have a margin account, this could potentially be a ""good faith violation"" if you don't have the cash in your account to make the purchase. A good faith violation occurs when you sell a security, and buy another before the cash has settled. Many brokerages will tell you how much cash you have available to make new purchases.

2021-03-18 17:37:14,stocks,"NVIDIA - $NVDA is a great long term investment I bought NVDA today, adding to a position I’d initiated in 2018 and have continuously added to on most dips. 

**The Bull Case**

* A great long term investment as demand for GPU’s will remain high for the next decade
* User markets such as data center, gaming and auto continue to grow
* Leader in its market segments – best in class products
* Gaming - Huge pricing power because of innovative, high quality product improvements such as ray tracing
* Strong competitive advantage with its CUDA software stack
* Mellanox acquisition also gives it a serious competitive advantage in Data Center
* 15% Rev and 20% earnings growth expected per year in the next 5 years.
* The ARM deal, if it goes through will be a huge shot in the arm for NVDA as a strategic near monopoly in licensing 
* NVDA has bought a majority of ARM with its own stock at $485 per share. The equity dilution is only 7%.

**The Bear Case**

* Stretched valuation at 40X Jan -22 earnings and 20X Jan-22 sales 
* Data center GPU users such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are investing heavily to build their own chips. 
* Crypto revenue is not sustainable 
* Post covid environment may reduce gaming and therefore GPU demand

**Challenges**

The ARM deal may not go through

The chances of several governments, especially the U.K and China passing the deal are low.  Several ARM customers have raised concerns about Nvidia likely misusing/abusing its position as the default licensor, forcing customers to use  its own chips.

With these concerns there will be heightened governmental and regulatory scrutiny into NVDA.

There are two interesting articles on the ARM deal. [Here’s the one from Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/03/11/why-the-nvidia-arm-acquisition-should-be-approved/?sh=44c39eac45b2)–  the author is hopeful that the deal goes through and why. She believes that governments like the US will push through to gain and maintain its competitive advantage in A.I.

The second is from Trading Places Research and called Nvidia and ARM: All About Control. It’s from Seeking Alpha and why the ARM acquisition makes sense for NVIDIA. Here’s the gist in the author’s own words.

>“But in the end, NVIDIA is trying to do what Apple does regularly, and is so very successful with: control the core technologies behind its products. NVIDIA wants to build a data center behemoth built around the CPU-GPU-DPU-AI stack. They control three of the four layers, and the Arm acquisition would give them the fourth, and most important layer in the stack. They can build this Goliath licensing Arm technology, but they would be dependent on someone else’s roadmap. That someone else is mostly in the business of selling smartphone SoC IP, and is most interested in the future of IoT.  
>  
>But again, this is precisely what is going to scare Arm’s customers so much. The entire smartphone ecosystem is dependent on the continued development of those cores, and if the company is shifting its attention to the data center, the rest may languish down the road. Those customers may even start looking at RISC-V. They have at least 18 months to mull it over, which is a lifetime in tech.”

**Valuation**

Sure, the stock's expensive at 530, but 3 years out NVDA earns about $24 a share, getting the PE down to 22, which is not bad for a 20% grower. 

Sources: Wall Street Journal, Seeking Alpha, Forbes, Motley Fool."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Nice writeup, not too long and a good categorization of pros and cons.

I have written about NVDA a few times before, I am long since 2019 with a cost basis of $139.50. For a long time, NVDA was about 5% of my portfolio (I prefer to hold about 20 high conviction, long-term companies in my portfolio at any given time) but recently, NVDA as a position has now fallen to more like 2-3% of my portfolio. I would therefore also like to add more (at least double my position), but I am apprehensive about the valuation (the obvious time to add would have been in March 2020, duh...).

Anyway, I do believe that Nvidia can eventually easily get to $100B+ in annual revenues. I work in a ""niche"" field that's not quite cloud, HPC or gaming but has similar technology requirements and I foresee a version of the future where the ARM-based Nvidia DPUs dominate the generic backend compute that is still dominated by x86 today (Intel and AMD). This is also the reason why I am not nearly as bullish on AMD as I am on Nvidia. Also as a side note, we use Mellanox NICs and they are a great company/team and a technology leader in what they do (I prefer their NICs over e.g. Solarflare).

To summarize, I am starting to think that I might have been wrong about the valuation with Nvidia and indeed missed some good buying opportunities during the last 6-8 months when it was available for below $500 (even after the post March 2020 recovery). Just to explain myself better, I do consider myself a value investor and typically the earnings multiple is one of the first things I look at. A lot (but not all) of my other 5% holdings are more classic ""value"".

And just to clarify something, the thing is, from a purely quantitative POV,  40x forward earnings is not insanity... at 20% annual earnings growth, price-to-earnings multiples up to 40 (or even 50) can be acceptable (see ""Security Analysis"" by Graham et al). It's all about what the risk is with respect to the company being able to maintain its current earnings growth trajectory.

The $300B EV might be another thing that understandably turns people off, but obviously at some point Nvidia can start accelerating stock buybacks.

FWIW, I am not adding yet at these levels, but I am seriously thinking about it.

P.S. One thing about Nvidia is that it's not a SW company so it doesn't have SW company margins or ROC/ROA. However, part of its moat is the barrier of entry and uniqueness in the competitive space. Like you said, a risk is that the IaaS companies / cloud providers will use their profits to design and build their own chips (in that scenario, ARM is still a major winner though)."

I own more Softbank than NVDA and honestly I thought NVDA got a really good deal on ARM, felt like it's worth more than what they agreed to. There's one element to the deal that's sort of gotten swept under the rug which is that there's a semi-autonomous Chinese sales office, which had full access to the intellectual property, that went rogue last year. The office in London tried to fire the guy in charge and he just refused and kept running it.

03/18/2021,stocks,"Thanks,

I agree with your point re DPU's, and the PE's. To your point the PEG (Price Earnings to Growth ratio) is as important as the PE. 

Peter Lynch used the PEG extensively throughout his 13 years at Magellan.
The forward PE of 34 (price $530/Jan 2023 earnings of 15.85) = 34, divided by the 19.11% earnings growth for Jan 2023 (34/19.11)= PEG ratio of 1.76.

Basically you're paying 1.76X growth, this further drops to 1.34 and 0.83, an additional two years out.

I'm usually comfortable with a PEG of around 2 for high growth companies, provided I can see it coming down below 1 in 2-3 years.

Also given the high valuation and the rise in interest yields, I'm accumulating on declines, only bought about 25% yesterday and put in a limit of $500 for another 25%. 

This tech carnage may run a bit more...there's no rush."
03/18/2021,stocks,More to come. A 30-50% Nasdaq correction wouldn't be considered too much imo.

03/18/2021,stocks,"Huge Peter Lynch fan here, I've read over 30 investment books and I still consider ""One Up"" the best introductory book (although ""One Up"" and especially ""Beating the Street"" go much deeper than just introductory level in fact). Off-topic but I also read the Fountainhead last year and loved it.

Nvidia is one of those ""Peter Lynch""-style investments that I have because it's related to what I do for work. The other two are STX and WDC. With STX and WDC, you also need to look past the current yield and earnings multiple (especially with WDC as it is also in part a turnaround situation). For our company, data has become ""hazardous waste"" and we spend a huge amount of money each year on HDD storage. In many cases, tape is not a possibility and flash (SSDs) are too expensive, so HDDs are ideal for that. Not to mention what's happening with YouTube, security cameras, self-driving cars, etc. Just recently, some analysts have finally figured out that due to cloud storage requirements, HDDs are here to stay and then some (""mass capacity, enterprise-grade drives account for 62% of revenues, twice the level of five years ago, as public cloud ""hyperscalers"" store more data on Seagate and Western Digital drives. He sees Seagate transitioning toward a high margin and secular growth story, driven by a doubling of data creation every three years""). If there's one thing that Apple, Google et al won't start making themselves, it's HDDs. There's obviously some risk from China etc. but large capacity drives are actually not that easy to make and there's a lot of IP and RnD investment that goes into it.

Re: tech carnage, I'm also adding to FB now. There are risks with the company for sure, but I still think it's ""insane"" that a 20% grower with 15-20% ROA/ROC and 45% EBIT margins is trading at a market multiple (along with ""stalwarts"" such as KO, PEP or even WMT or HD)."

2021-03-18 17:33:52,stocks,"""This could be the next TESLA"" and Powerpuff Girls I've been seeing a lot of posts and comments with something in the lines of ""This could be next TESLA"", and while some are using it as a meme, others are serious and take whats being said pretty serious.

I think one of the origins of this is fomo - fear of missing out, and I understand that, in fact, I think almost everyone understands that. We all have that unrealistic side that still hopes that we gonna hit the jackpot on a stock and get a lot of money. Everyone day-dreams and I think thats good thing, however it also needs to be compartmentalized.

When you join FOMO, with day dreaming and companies like TESLA or Amazon (and in a way GME for a few) that enforce the latter, things can get a bit out of hand.

It is way to easy to get lost and end up both checking stocks that we now think its too late to get in (and oh no we just lost our chance of getting rich) or getting into some stocks that its more gamble than actually DD. And despite writing this post, I have at least one stock that I feel like is gamble and supports my day dream wishes of getting rich, the problem is not on having such stock, but rather build our portfolios based on that.

So when I see posts saying that X Company can be the next Tesla just... chill. Think that through, either if you are writing it or reading it.

In the first case have in mind that a lot of people might read it, people with different backgrounds, knowledge, hopes, dreams and also age. Don't over sell something but rather aim for getting comments like ""I think this has more potential than you are giving to it"". Comments like this means that people actually made some research.

If you are reading... well long-story short... do DD (there are plenty of posts warning about it).

Now the ""Next TESLA"" thing:

A company is many things and many things impact that company. Like Powerpuff Girls sugar ain't enough. What made Powerpuff girls was not only the sugar but also the Chemical X.

Example:

Just because Tesla has had a huge success on EV that does not mean that Seat will have the same success on EV too. Traditional auto brands aiming for EV and changing the their plans for the next years is not the Chemical X but rather the Sugar. I mean, lets be real, it was expected!

Chemical X in Tesla might be Elon itself, might be because it was the first big EV project that succeded, might be because a buch of reasons all together that... well, are unique to Tesla.

That doesn't mean that only Tesla has Chemical X and others don't, but rather don't think it something easy to find or easy to tell.

Not every company will be the next TESLA (most likely 99% of them won't) and for sure something that several companies are investing it also won't be the next Chemical X.

The whole point of this post was just to getting this off my chest and, hopefully, reach to one or two users that really think that everything ""could be the next Tesla"" or believe it when someone says it will. They might be right but... if we were all right all the time... we wouldn't still be here but rather in our own Tesla's in a beach somewhere.

The large VC funds that were in the stock converted from their Series B to Series A common and have begun to liquidate their positions and return capital to their LP's as is their business model. This is no doubt creating an overhang which was coupled with the broader retracement in Tech with inflation fears pulling up rates and thus putting pressure on tech in general. It's probably a decent entry point if you like it long-term as once their shares are absorbed by the market the company will be free of the overhang and have a much more substantial float.

Also it's usually a bad idea to buy and hold soon after an IPO, since many institutional investors flip IPOs to take advantage of the hype created by the underwriting investment banks through road shows and press promotions; both the underwriters and early IPO buyers profit when selling high post-IPO to retail investors.

At this point it's only the VCs involved and the company's management who have a chance to put a realistic valuation on Snowflake. Maybe their underwriters have a reasonable idea as well, but of course they won't disclose their inner estimates to the public. The prospectus they made is only a sales pitch that overvalues the company (as prospectuses generally do).

As far as I know, their bulge bracket underwriters were Goldman, Morgan Stanley,  J.P. Morgan, Allen & Co and Citigroup."

The tech-heavy Nasdaq reversed steep losses Wednesday as Treasury yields came off their highs of the day after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell soothed market concerns about higher policy interest rates anytime soon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 33,000 level for the first time ever. The S&P 500 also closed at a record high. Dow futures were steady Thursday.

> * While raising its outlook for economic growth and inflation, the Fed cut its unemployment rate forecast to 4.5% this year. The unemployment rate was 6.2% in February. In another hint about the jobs picture, set for release 8:30 a.m. ET, economists expect 700,000 new filings for unemployment benefits last week. That would be down from the prior week’s 712,000 initial jobless claims.

> * Despite Fed assurances that near zero rates likely won’t rise through 2023, the 10-year Treasury yield Thursday touched 1.74%, a high back to January 2020, as traders continued to battle central bankers on rates. The rapid climb in the benchmark yield, which started this year under 1%, has been a drag on high growth stocks, many of which are tech stocks on the Nasdaq, as higher rates erode the value of future profits and squeeze market valuations. In addition to releasing projections Wednesday afternoon after its two-day March meeting, the Fed left rates and its asset purchase program unchanged.

> # 3. Top Biden officials and Chinese diplomats set to meet

> * America’s top diplomat early Thursday pressed China to use its “tremendous influence” to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear program, hours after reclusive Pyongyang vowed to ignore any U.S. overtures to resume negotiations. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke at the end of security talks with South Korea in Seoul.

> * Blinken will meet senior Chinese officials in Anchorage, Alaska, on his way back to Washington later Thursday. Ties between the world’s two largest economies have been torn for years and the Biden administration has yet to signal whether it’s ready or willing to back down from the hardline stance taken under former President Donald Trump.

> # 4. House to vote on two immigration bills, including one for ‘Dreamers’

> * The House was set to vote Thursday on a bill to give so-called Dreamers, immigrants brought to the U.S. as kids, full legal status and a chance for citizenship. A second measure would do the same for immigrant farm workers. Both measures seemed certain to pass. When similar versions of the bills passed the House in 2019, seven Republicans voted for the Dreamers bill and 34 backed the farm workers measure. However, GOP support is expected to plummet this time as the party rallies behind demands for tougher restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border.

> # 5. Federal April 15 tax-filing day delayed until May 17

> * The federal April 15 tax-filing day has been postponed about a month. Taxpayers can also delay payment of any money owed the IRS until May 17. However, the extended deadline applies only to federal income returns and taxes, meaning that taxpayers will need to check to see if due dates for state taxes have been changed. Not all states follow the same filing schedule as the federal government. Calls to delay Tax Day intensified after passage of the latest Covid relief plan, which tasks the IRS with sending another round of direct payments at the same time it usually processes tax returns and refunds.

03/18/2021,stocks,"I’m stupid but own shares in APHA, is this good?"
03/18/2021,stocks,100 shares of APHA = 83 shares of TLRY
03/18/2021,stocks,I'm stupid as well.  I own TLRY. Am i going to get screwed?
03/18/2021,stocks,How do you think this will effect TLRY closer to the conference's?
03/18/2021,stocks,Will this dilute tilrary stock so it becomes less valuable? Rn it is trading around $27 when the merger finished will stock price still be around that range or will the newly added aphria shares cause a price drop?
03/18/2021,stocks,Can you explain what happens to APHA options post acquisition?
03/18/2021,stocks,No it was not
03/18/2021,stocks,What’s your guess on Tilray price around vote date 4/16 and merger date 4/20?? What’s the price going to be?
03/18/2021,stocks,Is 100 shares of aphria at 7.25 price average good?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yes.


Every apha share is 0.8381 Tilray shares.

Tilray being more expensive than Aphria means you are profiting off of this arbitrage"
03/18/2021,stocks,No one is stupid. There are only people who lack accurate information :)
03/18/2021,stocks,83.81
03/18/2021,stocks,"You are not stupid, only lacking accurate information :)

However, TLRY will become the largest cannabis company, so the stock should receive a boost after the acquisition.

Anyway, investing in cannabis is a long term investment, so just hang in there and you will eventually start to see gains in the future. We just have to closely follow the quarterly statements and reports to make sure the the company isn't making moves that could potentially land it in bankruptcy. Then we should run for the hills if that happens lol."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I don't think that it will have a big effect on TLRY.  The stocks of both companies are highly vital by nature. However, shareholders in both companies seams to be reacting positively to the acquisition."
03/18/2021,stocks,It can't dilute the value of Tilray as Tilray's market cap is 4.7B and Aphria's is 6.5B. The company will be worth over 11B at the merger.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I have only recently started dabbling with Options and have not yet and the pleasure or pain of experiencing an acquisition/merger with options involved, but you can ask on r/options

Also, I found some info here:

[https://www.mystockoptions.com/articles/my-company-is-being-acquired-what-happens-to-my-stock-options-part-1](https://www.mystockoptions.com/articles/my-company-is-being-acquired-what-happens-to-my-stock-options-part-1)"
03/18/2021,stocks,No it sucks
03/18/2021,stocks,"You have a gain, why didn't it be good? Is this a serious question?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah, this make me feel less bad about purchasing APHA shares at $23.36."
03/18/2021,stocks,What if tilray is less then APHA for the merger?
03/18/2021,stocks,Awesome I’ll have to buy more then
03/18/2021,stocks,"It's only 83 shares. Fractional shares are not allowed, all results are rounded down to the nearest whole value."
03/18/2021,stocks,Perfect answer. Thanks!
03/18/2021,stocks,I don’t see why you would think they will get a boost after the acquisition. The boost in share price comes in at the announcement of things usually not the event itself.
03/18/2021,stocks,Hit the nail right on the head.
03/18/2021,stocks,Hey I bought APHA at $31 lmao. Thankfully I have been able to average down to $21
03/18/2021,stocks,Dont feel bad
03/18/2021,stocks,And I'm feeling dumb watching it go down with 66 @17.22🤷🏼‍♂️
03/18/2021,stocks,APHA 28.50 USD here
03/18/2021,stocks,"Shareholders can revoke their votes to accept the acquisition up until April 13, 2021. After that the deal is locked in and wont be renegotiated. I am watching company events and the market closely to see if there are any red flags that would cause me to change my vote. If the deal does get approved and APHA does surpass TLRY afterwards I most likely would sell at the 11th hour. It wouldn't make any sense to lose that much value in the conversion regardless how much I support the two companies."
03/18/2021,stocks,I think it might be your broker that is not allowing fractional shares for TLRY. I use Interactive Brokers and they allowed me to purchase a 0.378 share just now to test it. Now I have to purchase 0.622 to even it back out because fractional shares drive me nuts lol  XD
03/18/2021,stocks,"That is usually true for acquisitions through purchases because of the new debt, but this is a acquisition through merging. There is no new debt or decrease in cash.

The acquisition will increase Tilray's financial position and Tilray will have a larger client base.  Tilray after the acquisition will claim the No. 1 market share in the Canadian retail cannabis market. Aphria also has accesses to pharmaceutical distribution in Germiny which now will become Tilray's accesses.

Tilray will now have accesses to Canada, the UK, Germany, and  Portugal.

Also, many investors like myself divide new share purchases up across multiple companies. So the next time I purchase more shares, more of my money will go into Tilray instead of being divided between Aphria and Tilray.

I believe less competition will give a boost to all remaining companies in the cannabis market."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yes, doubling down is my main strategy to actively fight loss.  My initial purchase was at 29.27, and I got it down to 23.36 average."
03/18/2021,stocks,hang in there
03/18/2021,stocks,So if APHA is more at the time of the merger then it’ll be bad for APHA shareholders?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Buying fractional shares using a broker is a different scenario than Tilray issuing shares for the merger. According to the prospectus:

[https://www.aphriatilraytogether.com/#Faqs](https://www.aphriatilraytogether.com/#Faqs)

**Q. Will I receive fractional Tilray Shares?**

A. No. If the total number of Tilray Shares that you will be entitled would result in a fraction of a Tilray Share being issuable, the number of Tilray Shares you will receive will be rounded down to the nearest whole Tilray Share."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Not in this instance, I promise you. It has nothing to do with brokers."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Well I wouldn't say it would be bad for the shareholders. It will be bad for shareholder gains.

If you do decide to sell in that event, you MUST use a limit order. If you don't use a limit order you can lose the gains that you are trying to save. don't set the limit order too high or it might not not execute in time."
03/18/2021,stocks,Thanks for the info. I missed that fact. They suck for not rounding up lol.
2021-03-18 16:34:13,stocks,"Is it just me, or does premarket seem to open lower than market open lately? If today pushes higher when market opens, I'll be convinced that pre-market is a good buying opportunity. Only a month ago, it felt like pre-market was a scam. Stocks would trade much higher, just to fall for the rest of the day."
03/18/2021,stocks,if premarket could fuck off that would be great hahaha
03/18/2021,stocks,"You can false pump or dump futures to give a false direction of what market will do.

This is a trick."
03/18/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/18/2021,stocks,I hope your right on in 4 min I’ll be posting red across the board.
03/18/2021,stocks,JP's comments were supposedly good for stocks...let's c in a few mins... I'm leaning towards a red day though...
03/18/2021,stocks,Youre in a crash right now. Do you really think going long is a good bet?
03/18/2021,stocks,"See 10 yr treasuries.

Powell was ballast for the market yesterday."
03/18/2021,stocks,"No idea how to understand or read pre market really, just seems like big boys jerking off lol"
03/18/2021,stocks,"They really weren’t that bad of a read yesterday, the only reason why we ended green across the board is because there was a major buy program across the board once the Fed announced what was expected. 

Once the bond dumping slowed down it looked like the Nasdaq was going to finish down 1ish to 1.2ish percent and it is right back where it spent most of yesterday."
03/18/2021,stocks,"i've observed the opposite, lots of pumps in pre-market with open extended hour orders from the day before or people fomo'ing into stuff they expect to run during market hours. there's almost always a little dip around 10-11am after  open"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm sorry :(.  
 
- an European"
03/18/2021,stocks,Yeah gonna be a red day in stocks I think.  Especially tech.

I say all this because I've seen a lot of your posts mentioning the short term momentum / long term fundamentals and I was curious what those time frames look like? While 4 years isn't exactly super long term, I also wouldn't consider it short term either. There is maybe some shifts that I've seen in the past month with the interest rates increasing (and some of my value plays FINALLY paying off), but just curious how long do you swim upstream before accepting that the market has indeed fundamentally changed?

For me, and many others, they effectively have no intrinsic value. And that's not a dangerous idea.

On the contrary, I think it could be dangerous for an individual investor to think that the stocks in his portfolio have any intrinsic value to him beyond the fact that they act as an instrument to increase his wealth. Beyond being something to buy and sell the stock itself doesn't mean much of anything. Problems, I think, come when an investor thinks of his stock as something more than this and he becomes attached to his stock and avoids selling even when it's a good time to do so. 

Perhaps unless you want a voting stake in a company, I don't think any individual stock has any intrinsic meaning. It's just something to buy or sell, and it could just as well be pet rocks or Pokemon cards, or Beanie Babies."

That's definitely true, you have to be able to recognize the winners and bet on them, otherwise you'll lose your money most likely. If you're really good at understanding the industry you may be able to make a lot of money, but if you don't, or you're just betting on the hype stock of the week for that industry then you're probably going to lose a lot of money.

No joke, earlier today I read someone's post here where they said they bought 4,000 shares of Lordstown after Hindenburg's short report on them came out, BEFORE reading the Hindenburg report.

03/18/2021,stocks,Yeah I was always confused how he thinks stocks hold intrinsic value. If civilization ended tomorrow he's not gonna be able to trade his stocks for food since those stocks likely only existed digitally and because nobody will assign value to those anymore. Things like food will always have intrinsic value since as long as life exists food will hold value. But a stocks value relies on humans agreeing it holds value. If I buy a stock for 50 dollars I cant gurantee the company doesn't go belly up and my shares now hold zero value.
03/18/2021,stocks,"It's not worth what we choose it to be.  We don't choose for food to have value.  It has value because we need it to survive.  We don't choose for seeds to have value.  They're valuable because we can grow food with them  We don't choose for oil to have value.  It has value because we can use it to get from point A to point B, or to operate machinery.

If society collapses then yeah, we get back to a state of nature and only things like food and water matter.  Okay.  Sure.  So if you think the economy is bound for collapse at any moment, then start prepping for that.  Hoard food, buy guns and ammo, and bury your gold.  Some people do.  But if you have relative confidence in the future of Western civilization, then you can invest in assets which aid specialization and help produce these things indirectly.

Instead of hoarding food, you could invest in a farming stock and profit off of them making food for other people, since food has intrinsic value and is always in demand.  Instead of hoarding oil, you could invest in an oil company.

Yeah, of course money has no intrinsic value.  It's just paper.  But we use it because it makes things easier.  If we didn't use money, then if I wanted a haircut I'd have to cook you dinner or something.  If I want to see a doctor I'd have to do his yardwork for a week.  Barter is inefficient and silly.  Money is better.

And assets like stocks are just another form of ""money"".  We allocate capital to people who specialize in different industries, and profit off of their ability to produce these goods and services in a more efficient way than we can.

What you're saying is just off base and a very big misunderstanding of how things work and why.  Precisely what this thread was addressed to.

>On what bases is a share of GME worth 500? It's just sentiment.

So tell me why Microsoft and Apple have mooned since the 1980s but GME decided to moon for 1 month and will eventually tank?  If it's just sentiment then any old stock like GME could have been Microsoft or Apple.  Why didn't they?  What's different about Microsoft and Apple?

Speculation happens, especially in the short-term.  But long-term it is most certainly not all about speculation."

It's not totally random.  In the short-term, maybe.  But in the long-term there's a reason why Microsoft outperforms, say, AMC.

03/18/2021,stocks,"OP here, good question and I wasn't the one who downvoted you.

Yes, stocks have intrinsic value.  It's their ability to provide returns to their investors (shareholders) via dividends or stock buybacks.  For large stakeholders, it's also because you get a say on how the company is run.

How much a certain stock will return over time is not 100% clear... that's the risk involved, and that's why you have to do your due diligence.

You're absolutely right - the intrinsic value can change at any moment.  That's why you have to be constantly following the news and what not.  But if it's a reputable, stable company like Amazon, operating in the US and not China, for example, then it's unlikely that any backbreaking news like that will ever come out.  Hell, with their business model and revenues they could probably find a way to sidestep that blow even if the stock tanked a little bit in the short-term.

But just because that value is constantly changing doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  Gamestop had high intrinsic value from 2000-2015 or so as the leading supplier of video games worldwide.  That intrinsic value dropped substantially around 2015 because these days we're getting all our videogames onlne... we don't need Gamestop.  The intrinsic value spiked again in 2020 when Ryan Cohen came on, because we know he has experience with selling stuff online and Gamestop could almost certainly capitalize on that model.

Note that GME's run up was not totally fueled by this new intrinsic value.  Actually it's interesting, /u/DeepFuckingValue (Keith Gill) DID make his original bet on GME because ""he likes the stock"" and he saw great intrinsic value in it what with Ryan Cohen, etc..  What happened was a lot of people jumped on with him as a speculatory play to drive the shorts out.  That was never DFV's intention.  He was just betting on the new, perceived intrinsic value of the company.

Also note that there is no way of knowing precisely what the intrinsic value is.  We have numbers, balance sheets, and financials to help, but nobody can really KNOW, because we're working with imperfect information in an uncertain universe.

Hope that helps and feel free to ask anything."

03/18/2021,stocks,I'd edit this sentence if I were you
03/18/2021,stocks,"> I've always considered myself a value investor working off of fundamentals. Things looked crazy to me in mid to late 2017, I still held, but moved to more cash than I usually would have. Finally by the end of 2018 I capitulated. I spent almost 2 years pretty severely underperforming the market by basing things on fundamentals, then 2 years over performing by shifting my focus to momentum/sentiment.

That's because you got in at the height of the bull run.  It wasn't a bad play.  If you can ride the wave, ride it.  Just have an exit strategy.

> I say all this because I've seen a lot of your posts mentioning the short term momentum / long term fundamentals and I was curious what those time frames look like? While 4 years isn't exactly super long term, I also wouldn't consider it short term either. There is maybe some shifts that I've seen in the past month with the interest rates increasing (and some of my value plays FINALLY paying off), but just curious how long do you swim upstream before accepting that the market has indeed fundamentally changed? (more a rhetorical question)

It hasn't fundamentally changed.  It can't.  Things that are valuable will always be valuable, and things that aren't, won't.  When you invest in stocks with fundamental value, you're investing in iPhones, high-demand green energy, good cars, cloud computing, etc.  All of these things have value in the long run.

Nobody can tell you the timeline, because nobody knows.  We could go crashing down next week, or we could go crashing down in 10 years.  But we will crash.  The market always corrects itself.  Nobody knows when, and we also don't know how severe it will be.  That's why people say don't time the markets.

I recommend diversifying.  If you want to throw some in market sentiment stocks, great.  That's not a bad way to generate crazy bullish returns.  And then you could invest in some long-term fundamentally sound stocks in order to hedge against any sort of market correction.  The former will perform spectacularly in a sort of mania / bull run, but also has tremendous downside risk in the event of a correction.  The latter won't generate YOLO returns during a bull run, but it will generate *something*, and will also protect you from downside risk in the long-run.  So why not a bit of both?

Some people avoid the dilemma all together by investing in the S+P 500 (SPY) and just letting it ride.  Not a bad option either.  Me personally I'm not doing that right now because I can't afford to lose a lot of money with my investments, and I think there's legitimate concern for the entire S+P 500 to tank at some point in the near future.  I could be wrong, it may not come for another 10 years, and I'll eat my words.  But I've opted for defensive stocks that will pay me steady dividends.  Will underperform the S+P 500 if it does well, but will also overperform if it does poorly.  And provides much higher returns than a high yield savings account.

Then you could consider investing in other assets like bonds, crypto, precious metals / mining stocks, real estate, etc.  And holding some in cash.  Bonds don't have as much downside risk as stocks, and if the stock market isn't looking good people will run there for returns.  Similar to defensive stocks.  Precious metals / crypto are a great inflation hedge, and tend to do well during corrections.  Real estate would give you steady income streams outside of the equities market.

The idea is if you get hit in one area, another area will make up for it.  Instead of just going full market sentiment bull and buying Tesla at the top and then losing it all at the bottom.  That's the risk you run when you run on sentiment alone... you never know when people are going to go running for the exit.  So this strategy won't maximize returns, but it will most certainly minimize losses.

And going back to your original point: if you can truly find good companies, then you very well COULD outperform the S+P 500 in the long term.  The markets will run up sometimes, correct sometimes, but good companies will weather both bear and bull markets.

> I wasn't involved back then, but I know that in the dotcom bubble there was a lot of this similar talk (value investing is dead) and it came back. But with dotcom, housing, and whatever this market is, over the past 20+ years now, it seems like sentiment/momentum is making up a larger portion of what influences prices.

Yes, it is.  It was also that way in 2007, and look what happened.  That's always the indication of a bubble.

I don't know if we're in a bubble yet, because I'm still new to this, and one could argue that high asset prices right now are a reflection of potential future earnings.  I buy that to some extent, but we don't know how much is truly related to potential earnings and how much is related to speculation.  I also don't like the uncertainty with Covid, the Fed keeping interests rates low, our debt situation, etc.  Just a lot of uncertainty right now.

That's why I'm diversified and mostly defensive right now.  It fits my risk tolerance and I'm ok with sacrificing potential upside in order to protect myself from downside.  

Me personally in stocks, mining stocks, bonds, and some cash.  PS: Don't forget international stocks, different sectors, small cap, etc.

I hope this helps.  FWIW I only started investing last month, you've got more experience than me, but I do feel like I have a good grasp on how markets work thanks to my background in economics."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Lol.  I don't think any economist worth his salt would claim that economics is the same as physics or mathematics.  It's not a discipline where you can PROVE anything with absolute certainty, actually even science can't do that.  But that doesn't mean it's not a useful framework for trying to make sense of things. You just have to be aware of its limitations.

And these people do know very little.  Not because I have a degree and they don't.  But because what they are saying simply doesn't make sense. 

Not sure where the anti-economist rhetoric is coming from these days, but it shows a clear lack of understanding on the subject and the field."

03/18/2021,stocks,"It's intrinsic.  You're entitled to part of that company's returns.  If they have no returns, you're still entitled to them, it just means they didn't deliver.  That's the risk you run."
03/18/2021,stocks,"1. It pays dividends.

2. Just because it doesn't have intrinsic value to *you*, a small shareholder, doesn't mean it doesn't have intrinsic value to whales and large stakeholders, who DO get a say in the company.  Those whales have a huge effect on the stock's price, which in turn affects you."
03/18/2021,stocks,"> Perhaps unless you want a voting stake in a company, I don't think any individual stock has any intrinsic meaning. It's just something to buy or sell, and it could just as well be pet rocks or Pokemon cards, or Beanie Babies.

03/18/2021,stocks,I'd say my exact same situation. Single mid 20's MCOL to salary and just 1-2 year's of students loans to pay off. Can afford to lose quite a bit and still put in for my ROTH and 401k match. However I'm doing very well with my portfolio (mostly thanks to buying in around COVID) and my upside is potentially exponential right now in the current market. I doubt I'll make these same risks in 15-20 years assuming I'm married with kids and a mortgage.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Exactly, that's basically the same situation that most people I know are in, except they're fresh grads who are willing to take a relatively small risk for a life changing outcome. People have been gambling for ages, just gambling on stocks recently became more popular. I don't think it's that insane to comprehend. Now if you're only using the market to gamble then you're pretty much ruining your life and that's your own damn fault."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm sorry but I don't understand the part where you have debt but also ""plenty"" in your 401K and Ira. Coming for France I'm not used to this term, is this like a life assurance or something? Why are you not paying off your debt first?"

03/18/2021,stocks,"Same. I’ve been socking away money my employer-matched pension fund and making automatic deposits into an RRSP, which are both in relatively safe and diversified investments, but during the pandemic I started putting some fun money into a TFSA for stock market gambling. 

Most of my investment-related posts are on the speculative side, because really, what’s there to talk about with the other stuff? Oh boy, my employer-matched 10% came off my paycheque, just like every other payday! Oh, and it’s time to buy more VEQT, like every month! Boring."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I think most sensible people have a ""couch potato style"" portfolio, but are gambling on the side.

My degree is in finance, and I’ve been investing for approximately six years. I can still say with certainty that I am no expert.

I generally don’t comment too much, when I do it is often fairly brief.

03/18/2021,stocks,"It's not just agreeing that a stock hold values.  When you're holding stock in, say, a food production company, you're not just holding something digital.  You're holding a stake in a business which sells food, which, as you say, has intrinsic value.  Do you see the relationship now?

If all shit goes to hell, then yes, stocks are meaningless.  So a sensible investor would only invest in stocks if he is not expecting a total collapse of Western civilization.  I'm not expecting this, so I choose to invest in stocks.

If you are expecting this, you can invest in your own farmland, water purification, guns, food stores, etc.  That's an option.  I don't, because I have faith that civilization will keep going.  And as long as it does, my stake in that food production company grants me a stake in something with real value: food.

And no, you can't guarantee that the company doesn't go belly up.  Thats the risk, and that's why you have to make informed decisions.  You also can't be sure that holding cash is a good bet, because the dollar could absolutely tank.  You can't be sure of anything.  Even doomsday prepping is not a sure thing - nobody knows if or when doomsday will come.  So you just have to make the best decision for yourself given the present state of things."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Whoa, so much misinterpretation about what I said. I definitely should not have posted this on an economic forum lol

Let me put it into perspective, if the soviet union won the cold war, any stocks you owned in the 1970 would probably have disappeared. When covid hit, stock values plummeted even tho company fundamentals did not change.

If tomorrow we decide to start exchanging gold instead of paper, all your paper money will become worthless.

It's a system of trust, and a fragile one at that, there is no intrinsic value to capitalism/money/stocks. We could use many other systems to survive (one really inefficient one like you mentioned is bartering). People can all believe that the sun is magic and it will not change the fact that its a nuclear reaction. The reaction rate will not change, the spontaneity will not change it is unaffected by human behavior. the economy is heavily affected by sentiment. in fact, it was built on sentiment and trust"

03/18/2021,stocks,This.  Well said.
03/18/2021,stocks,Isnt that technically correct though? Intrinsic value doesn't actually exist because everything is based on money which doesn't have intrinsic value just the value we assign to it. Obviously trading and looking at money like this isn't useful and stocks have fundamental value in terms of us dollars.
03/18/2021,stocks,">""There's no such thing as ""intrinsic value"". All value is subjective to human desire.""

Uh, that's more or less correct though. Unless you are just arguing that intrinsic value is a measurable value that exists, then in that case I agree that it exists. Otherwise, the valuation of anything is absolutely not based on intrinsic value. Mainstream economics is literally based on the subjective theory of value."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Well I mean if we hit a scenario where the worlds civilization has crumbled and money as we know it is no longer in use what value to those stocks hold?

03/18/2021,stocks,Well put :D
03/18/2021,stocks,"Most of us in the US have our retirement contributions go straight from our paycheck to 401K pre-tax.  We can't touch that money without it being taxed so we can't use it to pay down debts like student loans. Plus employers sometimes ""match"" what you put in your 401K so there's an incentive to participate that beats out paying the student loans early.  Our student loan debt is often so insurmountable anyway we can't afford to wait saving for retirement until it is paid off. We'd be starting too late then."
03/18/2021,stocks,"A 401k is a retirement account. Money you earn can be put into your 401k without being taxed, so it’s not impacted by income taxes. If you withdraw the money prior to turning 60 the money is immediately taxed fully, if you start withdrawing after 60 then it is subject to significantly lower taxes

Because of these tax implications most people try to contribute the max contribution to their 401k each year and don’t touch the money at all until they are 60"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Answering the last part of your question, most student loan debt has an interest rate lower than what the returns are in a retirement account.

If I put $100 towards my debt that has 3% interest, I've ""made a 3% return"" paying into my principle. 

If I put that same $100 into a decent index fund or ETF, I'll likely make at least 3%, with a potential for more.

So right out of the gate it's better to invest if the interest rate is lower than conservatively estimated returns. 

Additionally, compounding will create far more significant returns down the road."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I have also been paying my student loans every month. I think you missed the point of what I'm saying though. I make a very healthy income. I am financially stable. I have no serious long term costs. But I like living in new york and can't ever see myself affording a house. And frankly I don't have confidence that even with healthy retirement savings I'll be able to retire with the standard of living I want. 

So I'm going for the gamble because there is low risk. Maybe the gamble allows me to buy a house one day or retire before I turn 70. Or maybe I lose 3k because NIO gets shut down by the chinese government. Idk. But to me it's worth the risk. And I think a lot of people are in a similar position to me and think the same way. Ridding myself of a $500/month student loan payment doesn't change anything in my life."
03/18/2021,stocks,"It's hilarious how some value investing guys will come to the penny stock subs and think they're saving us from ourselves by trying to convince us that it's gambling.

I'm messing around with less than a grand to entertain myself and pay off my mortgage or something if I make a series of great calls.

Momentum investing relies entirely on the 'greater fool' theory since it ignores fundamental analysis. As such, it is really a bet on market psychology and easily manipulated by those players who have more power to disseminate information (whether that information is correct or not) and better skill at influencing mass psychology.

I wouldn't say this time is different when it comes to great companies at great prices, etc.  But I would say that this time is different with Covid-19, climate change, the amount of US debt, China, wealth inequality, etc.

Great companies are still great investments.  But boomers like Buffet get a bad wrap because they came of age in a very privileged and comfortable time, and think we millennials (and younger) just ought to do things like they did.  We can't do things like they did, because we've been given a harder world than the one they had, at least economically speaking.

03/18/2021,stocks,"I agree it's not equal, but theory and practice complement each other.

To give an example: You could probably teach someone to do a certain surgical procedure without them having a good understanding of anatomy, physiology, or medicine. *However* we still require surgeons to go through med school and learn all the theory behind it. Because theory helps you understand the reasons things don't go as planned, it helps you adapt to new and different situations, make you able to foresee possible risks of the procedure, etc.

What I mean to say is, theory doesn't replace practice and experience, but it gives you something to fall back on when your practice and experience isn't enough. It also accelerates the learning process as you don't have to learn everything from trial and error."
03/18/2021,stocks,"In all fairness, basic economic theory isnt all youre getting with your degree. Im still a third year undergrad; but I gotta say that as you go along your degree it becomes more and more relavent to the real world. Last semester I had an entire class following the economic consequences of covid in real time; most of it was obsessively reading reports and papers the moment they were published and was honestly the best class Ive ever taken. My financial institutions course was also extremely helpful, I went from not knowing wtf was going on with the FED or how banks worked to being able to read FED monetary policy reports without much issue. Its been pretty cool, Freshman year the Economist seemed like a stuffy magazine that I struggled to understand and now I read it pretty regularly. 


That being said, if all your coming away with is lessons from micro and macro, yeah youre gonna have a very skewed view of the economy. Im not saying that economic theory is 100% sound, theres so much academic debate on even simpler concepts. And its one of the hardest sciences to actually test irl, as any fuckups could harm or even end up in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. But I wouldnt say that it has no intrinsic value, and honestly I feel that most people who say that never bothered to study the subject beyond a basic level."
03/18/2021,stocks,Theory helps to leap forward into good practices. Otherwise one will waste lot of time exploring the entire space of possible opportunities.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Lol, geez, I never said it did.  Spending 4 years studying economics didn't make me some wiz kid who knows how to time markets and find winning companies.  Far, far from it. 

It just made me a little more knowledgeable than the average investor who knows nothing.  That's intrinsic value.

Amazing that your comment is getting upvoted and mine downvoted.  Proves my point."
03/18/2021,stocks,lmao
03/18/2021,stocks," Economics isn't about ideology, it's a science. Biology studies living things, physics studies matter and it's behaviour, economics studies markets and how humans interact with them. Swing trading isn't really related to economics on its own, but swing trading a company with good fundamentals can be beneficial compared to swing trading a company with no income"
03/18/2021,stocks,Was thinking the same thing. That would be great. MOOODS are you listening!?
03/18/2021,stocks,"It's absolutely built on sentiment and trust.  But that doesn't mean it's fragile.  What's fragile to you?  The USA won the Cold War.  It's still the #1 superpower.  That's why people continue to bet on US debt, US equities, the US dollar, etc.  Of course, the trust in the US is being eroded little by little.  But I still wouldn't call it a ""fragile"" trust, as you've said.

Weak or fragile would be trusting the government of Zimbabwe with your debt or assets.  But the US is a pretty trustworthy place to be doing business at this time.

Doesn't mean things couldn't collapse instantaneously.  They could.  But are you betting on that?"
03/18/2021,stocks,You think the stock market is simple? You think it's all imaginary? Lol if you don't understand the market then just say so
03/18/2021,stocks,"Intrinsic value exists, it's just that the value of something isn't determined by its intrinsic value but by the subjective valuations of its buyers and sellers. What I'm trying to say is that price is determined by supply and demand."
03/18/2021,stocks,"In my mind money is a unit of measurement. An inch doesn't have value, but a cubic inch of lumber does. How many potatoes is a kg of gold worth? You're probably doing that conversion using dollars."
03/18/2021,stocks,"It's all related to human desires, yes.  That's true.  But there's a big difference between human desire for something because it's cool and trendy, vs. something that's actually useful.

If you think there's no inherent difference between a pantry full of food and a pantry full of poop, you're not getting the point.

Yeah, food isn't inherently more ""valuable"" than poop.  But it is to human beings.  And human beings are what make up the economy."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I don't think anyone is asking if a stock by itself has value outside the context of the corresponding company. That would be a very weird definition of intrinsic.

Your example shows that a stock's intrinsic value is a function of a company's success, which is the point I'm arguing."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I believe their ""argument"" was something like ""a stock has no inherent value, so the financials of the company you invest in don't matter, just the hype around it."""
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yes, and the difference is that the ones that win in the long run are the ones with real, long-term intrinsic value.  The short-term gamble is putting your money on a stick price just because you think it'll speculate up.  The long-term gamble is putting your money in a company because you think they'll generate good returns in the future. 

Both are gambles, but one is totally based on trader sentiment while the other is rooted in prospects for that company based on the way they're managed, their product line, long-term market trends, etc.  

The long play is less of a gamble."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I mean certainly nobody knows the EXACT value of any good or service, that's impossible and depends on far too many variables.

But it's clear that Microsoft in 2021 is a more valuable company than AMC.  And it's also clear that a pantry full of food is more valuable than a pantry full of shit.

It's not an exact science, no, but from there to stating that it just doesn't exist at all is a huge and disingenuous leap."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I just can't underscore enough, however, that it's not JUST because of social media.  The history of humanity has been filled with dummies.  I didn't live back then, so who knows, but my experience with people and how society works tells me that there's a severe lack of critical thinking that long predates social media.

But yes, I do think social media can aggravate things.  In the same vein you could also say that the internet (in general) makes information more accessible, so people are MORE informed.  I think we have both going on, but the social media dummies are the loudest."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I understand what you're saying.  TBH, didn't feel like it was worth my time, because I already spent time debating all of those commenters, and any new thread about it would probably be glossed over and not really make any impact on anyone or anything.  The best move for me was to share my ""wow"" moment and vent out my frustration.  

Everyone is free to share their thoughts, I was just sharing mine."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I feel you.  I do it for myself.  I have to vent, I'm human.  But at the end of the day I have to live and let live, forgive and forget... it's the best option for me.

Good luck to you, my friend!"

03/18/2021,stocks,"> Ultimately, nothing in society's eye has any value beyond what society is willing to ascribe to it.

Sort of.  But that usually implies that value is based on the whims of silly humans or something.  Food has value, for example.  Humans give it value, yes, but it's not just some need they made up or are going to forsake anytime soon."

It's all very pie-in-the-sky with **no** basis in reality.

I'd like to expand on the cult thing. This following that has developed behind $GME displays multiple signs of cultish behavior:

1. Imposing rigid rules or regulations (Hold! Don't sell! Keep buying the dip/hold the line!)
2. Minimize/discourage/defame outside news sources (That FINRA short interest report is a lie! It's actually much higher! It's rigged!)
3. Make extensive use of cult-generated information (All the jerkoff DD that's posted without *any* balanced view. Anything else is generated by a paid Melvin/Citadel/Santa Claus shill)
4. Extensive use of cult-specific lingo (HODL! APES STRONG TOGETHER! 💎🙌 🚀! HOLD THE LINE!)
5. Instill fear of the ""other"" group/outside world (Everyone that dissents is a HF shill! They just want you to sell!)

And that's not even hitting on all the points. It's the financial version of Qanon at this point.

Any returns you've already made on $GME were a once-in-a-generation thing, it's not going to happen again. The original short interest was closed between January and present, and any open short interest now are sellers that entered after that. Until $GME fixes their shit, based on financials, it is **not** worth more than $20, and that's being generous.

5 or 10 years down the road? *Maybe*, but not anywhere near current price levels. But until they get their shit together, it's going to eventually settle down into the $20 - $30ish range and stay there. Get out of $GME (and the cult) while you still have profit. The point of the market is to make money, and if you invest emotionally, you're going to lose a fuckton of money.

[I say all this being a former $GME bagholder at a cost basis of $322.95/share](https://i.imgur.com/ETFU1rf.png), just in case you get halfway through the first paragraph and start screeching about me being a Melvin shill or whatever the new hot shit fingers-in-your-ears insult for being rational is now."

03/18/2021,stocks,Absolutely - sorry I agree with all of that. The reality is if the minimum wage kept up with inflation since the 70's or 80's it would be something like $24 and I think it should be moved close to that. Buffett has been pretty outspoken about his support for more progressive economic solutions. I am not the brightest but I am smart enough to know that the companies that I have my money invested in would do better if the lower socio-economic classes were better off and were comfortably financially.

Doesn't mean I make hot shot investments or anything.  It just means I have a better grasp of the way things work, and inevitably I think that helps.  Most of all, actually, I think it protects me from a lot of risk.  Upside I don't know.  But it keeps me away from dumb plays rooted in ignorance."

03/18/2021,stocks,I don't think that makes much sense though because an inch remains constant. The value of money fluctuates so it makes it a pretty poor tool of measurement. I'd say it's more of a medium for exchanging labor between two parties.

I had a 3.75 and honors degree and worked two part time jobs without a car. You don't think a college will take me on a discounted rate? C'mon now...

The problem is... people arent taught how to live life *now* as opposed to when school was hyper-cheap 30 years ago.

Like... if you simply work for awhile in something decent paying that costs little to get into from debt relief to insurance, to plumbing or electrician work you will be fine. Furthermore, you'll have a good retirement if you're frugal and live within your means. Then you get your AA for damn near free, slay the game, go get the last two years at a reputable public university and only end up maybe 20gs in debt when you make 40-70g+ a year after.

It's a harsh lesson when we tell young people to jump into debt and don't actually teach them how to manage their debt etc., or other proper paths instead of school as well.

If more people in the economy had more money that they could spend, they would buy more things (presumably some of these things would have semiconductors in them). Demand for semiconductors would go up, which would cause the demand for Teradyne's products and services to go up. That's obviously very simple but I do believe the gains from the higher wages will offset the inevitable higher costs (higher wages = higher costs)."

As the frequent flyer knows there's a proven fear of clotting on long haul flights or continued long hauling over a certain period in time - due to the ""sitting a long time"" part of it.

>Many thousands of people develop blood clots annually in the EU for different reasons. The number of thromboembolic events overall in vaccinated people seems not to be higher than that seen in the general population.

The EMA initially disregarded it, then began an investigation which is set to conclude either today or tomorrow when more and more cases popped up in multiple countries.

You also continue to act on old news. For example, one of the leading German institutes called PEI has since updated their recommendation to the EMA and stated that there is concern due to the specific nature of the blood clots.

You continue to harp on the fact that the clots aren’t higher than the broader population. That’s true, **if** these were normal clots. They aren’t. A specific type of blood clotting is occurring, which you’re completely ignoring, and it is so insanely rare in young people that there was concern by a few days ago that the vaccine was causing it. You keep making a false equivalence to regular clotting events.

And the new report changes nothing? Only if you’re wilfully choosing to ignore it for your own benefit. The news is based on the Norwegian medical community, which btw has zero political reasons to tell the UK to piss off, has found that there can be no other cause than the vaccine for these specific clotting events.

Thats why the half dose regiment is superior because it triggers a weaker initial imuno reaction. Wether or not this leads to long term reduced effectiveness remains to be seen. However they discovered this by accidentally messing up in one their clinical trials. Under normal circumstances this would lead to a really hard approval path for FDA. From an analytical standpoint messing up the regime in your test is a major mistake. im not saying the vaccine is good or bad i just prefer when the data is clean."

An issue already addressed in the Monday statement. And readdressed again today by the EMA. To the same effect.


>the benefits of the vaccine in combating the still widespread threat of COVID-19 (which itself results in clotting problems and may be fatal) continue to outweigh the risk of side effects;

>the vaccine is not associated with an increase in the overall risk of blood clots (thromboembolic events) in those who receive it;

>there is no evidence of a problem related to specific batches of the vaccine or to particular manufacturing sites;

>however, the vaccine may be associated with very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia, i.e. low levels of blood platelets (elements in the blood that help it to clot) with or without bleeding, including rare cases of clots in the vessels draining blood from the brain (CVST).


To put this into context, there have been 36 reported cases of thrombocytopenia for the 17 million doses of the Astrazeneca jab delivered - an occurrence rate of ~0.0002%.

Thrombocytopenia is also a rare side effect of taking paracetemol - the most common painkiller consumed in the UK, occurring in less than ~0.01% of patients.


>You can’t wave away science or medicine because it is inconvenient.

03/18/2021,stocks,The half-dose hasn't been approved anywhere. It's the focus of further trials. All AZ vaccination is being done using the trial approved methodology. It may be adapted once the additional trials are complete.
03/18/2021,stocks,"You’re saying some different things now then you weren’t before. I agree that if, as has been announced 35 minutes ago, the EMA declares the vaccine safe, it should be used (the info has changed since our morning convo). But you implied that the Norwegian report “changed nothing” - that isn’t true, it was the first admittance by a medical body that there does appear to be a direct relation of the vaccine to these incidences.

You also cannot compare the 17 million doses to the incidence rate, because the rates are so localized to non-UK doses. This is what initially suggested the “bad batch” theory. The clots were statistically significant within the context of how few Europeans in those countries had received it. Plus, thrombocytopenia is not the concern here - it’s the combination of low platelets with massive clotting, and clotting also occurring in odd places, in young healthy people. That is scary as fuck, of course it was going to be taken seriously.

I don’t know where you’re getting this “political hype” angle. Do you seriously believe that European countries in the midst of a vaccination campaign they are stressing about being too slow would suspend the use of a vaccine just to get a dig at the UK? That is a level of conspiracy thinking I’m not prepared to agree with. 

I’m glad you agree it should be investigated, and it has - the investigation concluded between this morning and now - but suspending it was the right call. You do not continue to administer a drug that may be causing blood clots in young healthy people at a rate that is higher than expected, especially after multiple medical institutes raise concern. You just believe major European doctors would risk their careers raising concerns just to score a hit on Britain. 

(Also worth nothing the EMA has yet to determine the AZ link to the combination of low platelet and high clotting, meaning the major question of the vaccines safety remains unanswered at this point)"

Reluctant to take one particular vaccine doesn't make anyone anti-vax, given that the time of development and approval does raise some eye browns. I believe many people refusing to take AZ vac now have taken many vac in their life, and would be happy to take Pfizer's and Moderna's vac."
03/18/2021,stocks,It’s not considered unsafe though. The WHO literally said it’s safer to have the vaccine than not have it
03/18/2021,stocks,"In this case I have to say it does seem suspicious to me that they're not giving any public statement as to why they think it causes blood clots. What possible reason could there be to not say something, anything, however vague or abstract? The only thing I can think to explain that is that they don't actually have a reason."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I don't understand the connection you're making with scientific theories to press conferences. So if the theory of gravity, or theory of evolution, or the germ theory of disease, were announced at a press conference, that would somehow discredit them?

Not according to the article linked above:

> **These findings support our hypothesis, which we launched early on, that these patients have a strong immune response, which has led to the formation of antibodies that can ignite the platelets, and thus cause a thrombus (blood clot),"" says Holme at the press conference.**

> **Professor Holme, who is also chief physician at the Department of Blood Diseases at OUS, told NRK on Tuesday that it was likely that there was a connection between the vaccine and the side effects.**

I'm not claiming to know anything about the situation - I didn't do the research - but if we're basing our understanding of the situation on the information available to us, you would be incorrect in saying the scientists aren't presenting ""any of the above"". They have presented the definition of a scientific hypothesis-theory model."

You'd rather side with politicians than medical experts. Hmm... I think you've just said all you need to about the subject. Just a friendly heads up, don't inject bleach.

I mean, it kind of does. The experts are literally saying that this is extremely detrimental to the vaccination effort and can exacerbate the already dire situation due to a 3rd wave.

03/18/2021,stocks,Just re-approved. Stupid.
03/18/2021,stocks,"The point is that science is not based on what someone says it is based on what they can prove through experimentats. As you correctly state this is done through peer review of the experimental design, analysis and interpretation of results produced by the scientists. The more significant the claim the more thorough the experiment and the review must be in order to avoid making mistakes.

Gravity, evolution and germ theory have been so thoroughly studied, tested and verified that it is now quite acceptable for someone to assert these ""theories"" as fact. Whether that's by press conference or other medium it doesn't matter.

What these Norwegian scientists are doing is ignoring the normal scientific process and going with telling everyone their theory, via the press conference *first*, before there's been any external peer review. Their ""findings"" are based on the examination of exactly three patients. Three! That's an embarrasingly low number which would be thrown out by any reviewer. What they are doing is absolutely not ""the best they can"".

I agree not every scientific press conference is spurious, but when they're devoid of verifiable evidence be very wary. As a counter example the ground breaking discovery of the Higgs boson was also announced to the public by press conference, but that was to coincide with the publication of their paper which had been through peer review so were able to present conclusive evidence."

03/18/2021,stocks,"I can't speak to peer review, neither the article or the press conference mention whether there is peer review one way or the other, but I would agree that peer review would be necessary to truly make it a valid theory. 

Aside from that though it seems very subjective as to what is considered a ""real"" theory, and what constitutes being thorough enough. In this case they formed a valid hypothesis, and [again to some subjective extent] proved that hypothesis through experimentation and scientific observation. 

> Their ""findings"" are based on the examination of exactly three patients.

I realize that's a pretty low sample size, but it doesn't negate the fact that they *still* found a very valid link between the vaccine and the condition. Yes it's not ideally thorough for a theory, but this goes back to what constitutes a 'true' theory. 

> What they are doing is absolutely not ""the best they can"".

I disagree. They performed as exhaustively thorough experiments and observations humanly possible on the low sample size that was available to them. They formed a scientific hypothesis early in the study (their words), and arrived at a conclusion which validates the theory. And given the current situation, wouldn't you agree a press conference (despite no peer review) is reasonable to disseminate the information they discovered? We're talking about a potentially dangerous situation where a good deal of people's lives may be at risk. Again they're merely making public the results of their experiments; the potential alternative is that they stay silent and this winds up becoming an even greater problem, many people die, and the press conference that never happened (because of lack of peer review) would have saved those lives."
03/18/2021,stocks,I specifically went back to my starting page to claim my oft ignored free award just to give it to this comment
03/18/2021,stocks,"> They formed a scientific hypothesis early in the study (their words), and arrived at a conclusion which validates the theory.

That's called ""confirmation bias"". That's also bad science. What other alternative and plausible explanations are there? How have they discounted them? Could it be simply random?

In science there's the null hypothesis. Which is where the initial assumption of any theory or hypothesis is that there is no effect on your observation. If you do see an effect is it strong enough to ""reject the null"". This is a crucial step, because a biological organism is a hugely complex system so all sorts of random effects can be observed without them being directly caused by your experimental conditions. So what they have done is the opposite of null hypothesis testing; they had idea and locked for evidence to support it.

And I'm sorry but three cases is no way near enough to even establish the beginnings of a theory. It may spark an idea, but that's all.

> Again they're merely making public the results of their experiments; the potential alternative is that they stay silent

What results? There aren't any. They're effectively saying ""Trust us, we know what we're seeing"" which is not science.

The alternative is not to stay silent. The alternative is to write up your theory, backed-up with evidence and present it to your peers for discussion. Then the community compares it to other cases/experiments to see if they're consistent with the theory. So on and so on until the evidence supports the theory or not and other explanations are unlikely or not. It sounds laborius but can happen very quickly as happened throughout the pandemic, just not in the public eye.

People's lives *are at risk*, but from COVID not the vaccine(s). The worst outcome is that these scientists cause vaccine hesitancy which allows the vaccine to spread resulting more harm to people and the economy. 10s of millions of people have been vaccinated with no significant harms except to people who have a history of severe allergic reactions."

> What results? There aren't any. They're effectively saying ""Trust us, we know what we're seeing"" which is not science.

What are you even talking about? You're saying you *know* how they conducted the experiment? Because otherwise how would you know how they arrived at the conclusion they did? Everything you've just said literally goes against what was said in the press conference and written in the article, so clearly you know something the rest of us don't. 

The researchers specifically say that they discovered a **link**, that the observations **support the hypothesis**, and that given what they know there is **likely a connection** (also note they're not claiming they know this as absolute truth, they're using the very typical scientific language around hypotheses/theories). It's implied that they found a causal link from their findings (and again, they did not even specify what their findings were in the press conference, so how are you saying that there aren't any results??). 

The null hypothesis is not an absolute for the scientific method. There can be and are many valid scientific hypotheses that don't fall exactly inline with a null hypothesis, that's only one method. Also, again, **they never stated what their hypothesis is** - So I ask again, where are you getting your information from? Pure conjecture. 

> The alternative is not to stay silent. The alternative is to write up your theory, backed-up with evidence and present it to your peers for discussion. Then the community compares it to other cases/experiments to see if they're consistent with the theory.

Which takes far more time than announcing the currently available information that you do have. Which again they are not presenting as absolute truth, they're extremely careful with their language.

Extremely misleading statistic; we're only talking about the AZ vaccine, not all of them combined."

> What are you even talking about? You're saying you know how they conducted the experiment? Because otherwise how would you know how they arrived at the conclusion they did? 

That is the exact opposite of what I'm saying. Why is it so hard to understand? No-one knows what they did because they've not shown us. We've only got their word to go on. That's not scientific. 

You even said it yourself:

> The researchers specifically say that they discovered a link, that the observations support the hypothesis, and that given what they know there is likely a connection. 

They ""say"" they don't ""demonstrate"" nor ""evidence"". Never believe what a scientist says, believe what the evidence shows. 

Anyway this is all moot because the MHRA and EMA have confirmed the safety of the vaccine based on all the data. So a theory based on three Norwegian cases has had little impact."

CELEBRATION, Fla., March 11, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KemPharm, Inc. (NASDAQ: KMPH), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of proprietary prodrugs, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020.

“The fourth quarter of 2020 and early 2021 was a period of significant activity and accomplishment for KemPharm as the company has restructured its balance sheet, extinguished its debt, re-listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market and perhaps most importantly, received approval for the AZSTARYS NDA,” said Travis C. Mickle, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of KemPharm. “Completing the multi-phased financial restructuring process was critically important during this timeframe, and bringing this together required a series of transactions that had to be orchestrated in a specific sequence. Now, combined with the approval of AZSTARYS, KemPharm is in a position of strength as we look forward to realizing the value from our development investments and the growth that is possible for the Company as a result.”

Dr. Mickle continued, “Now with the AZSTARYS approval behind us, we are working alongside the Corium team on the product’s commercial launch which is expected as early as the second half of 2021. As discussed during the December investor event, Corium is enthusiastic about AZSTARYS’ potential as a treatment for ADHD with what we believe is a clear strategy for bringing the product to market.”

Dr. Mickle concluded, “We are also pleased to have received FDA clearance for the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for KP879, our extended-duration, agonist replacement therapy for the treatment of Stimulant Use Disorder (SUD). KP879 is an important addition to our product candidate portfolio as it provides an opportunity to address a disease indication – SUD – for which there are no FDA-approved medications, as well as to demonstrate the versatility and value potential of serdexmethylphenidate (SDX), our prodrug of d-methylphenidate. SDX is the primary API for KP879, as well as AZSTARYS and KP484, showcasing the potential for our prodrugs a platform technology. We now look forward to initiating the clinical program for KP879 in 2021.”

**Q4 and Full-Year 2020 Financial Results:**

For Q4 2020, KemPharm reported revenue of $2.4 million, which was primarily derived from service fee revenue, as compared to Q3 2020 revenue of $1.9 million, which was also primarily derived from service fee revenue.   Current consulting arrangements are expected to provide service fee revenue through March 2022.

KemPharm’s net loss for Q4 2020 was ($4.9 million), or ($1.07) per basic share and diluted share, compared to net loss of ($6.0 million), or ($2.90) per basic and diluted share for the same period in 2019. Net loss for Q4 2020 was driven primarily by operating loss of ($3.2 million) and net interest expense and other items of ($1.6 million). The net operating loss of ($3.2 million) for Q4 2020 was a change of $1.2 million compared to net operating loss of ($4.4 million) in the same period in 2019, which was primarily due to a decrease in royalty and direct contract acquisition costs related to the KP415 License Agreement of $1.9 million and an increase is revenue of $1.0 million, partially offset by an increase in research and development expenses of $0.6 million and an increase in general and administrative expenses of $1.2 million.

For full-year 2020, KemPharm reported revenue of $13.3 million, which was primarily derived from service fee revenue and a milestone payment in Q2 2020 of $5.0 million related to the acceptance of the NDA by the FDA, as compared to full-year 2019 revenue of $12.8 million, which was also primarily derived from an upfront licensing fee payment of $10.0 million, as well as service fee and reimbursement revenue.

KemPharm’s net loss for full-year 2020 was ($12.8 million), or ($3.21) per basic share and diluted share, compared to net loss of ($24.5 million), or ($13.23) per basic and diluted share for the same period in 2019. Net loss for full-year 2020 was driven primarily by operating loss of ($5.6 million) and net interest expense and other items of ($7.2 million). The net operating loss of ($5.6 million) for full-year 2020 was a change of $14.7 million compared to net operating loss of ($20.3 million) in the same period in 2019, which was primarily due to a decrease in royalty and direct contract acquisition costs related to the KP415 license agreement of $1.6 million, a decrease in research and development expenses of $10.6 million, a decrease in general and administrative expenses of $2.9 million and an increase in revenue of $0.4 million, partially offset by severance expense of $0.8 million related to the departure of the chief business officer in Q1 2020.

As of December 31, 2020, total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $4.3 million, which was a decrease of $1.1 million compared to September 30, 2020. As a result of the Company’s completion of its multi-phase financial restructure process discussed below, total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of March 10, 2021 was $77.6 million. The Company believes that, based on its current operating forecast, without taking into account expected service fee and reimbursement revenues, royalty revenues or milestone payments, its existing resources are sufficient to continue operations up to at least Q1 2024.

To me, price fluctuations in both directions seem likely. Could be that a lot of OG investors sell because the price has pumped since September. But it also looks likely to go up to 40 in the short term due to the natural ebb and flow of the market. The chart that the top commenter posted shows the waves that this stock seems to trade in. The lockup expiry is common knowledge and a lot of newvie investors are cautious. If the OG investors don't sell, we'll likely see a buy in from the newbies very quickly.

03/18/2021,stocks,I dont think that's the case. There is no company that targets gaming pcs directly the way crsr does. Yes other companies have products but gaming is where brand recognition is a huge thing.

03/18/2021,stocks,They don't actually manufacture any of their chipsets. They simply rebrand pre-assembled products. And I'm not arguing with you that they have bad products. I love their products.. but that doesn't make it worth an investment
03/18/2021,stocks,"""ecosystem"" baby ""ecosystem"""
03/18/2021,stocks,Are you comparing Apple's moat to moat of company that makes PC and console peripherals? Only on Reddit.
03/18/2021,stocks,MSI partered with Corsair and is the boards for their line of gaming PCs.
03/18/2021,stocks,neither does NVIDIA or AMD...
03/18/2021,stocks,corsair has an RGB eco system...and sells prebuilts using all their acquired companies products
03/18/2021,stocks,"we were talking about apples ""moat"" and how they differ given their tightly controlled application ecosystem. whats this about RGB leds now?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Corsair’s products products all use a proprietary RGB connector.

Sure you can go put multiple different RGB hubs in your system and run multiple different RGB software‘s but that will make your computer perform badly."
2021-03-18 14:52:37,stocks,"At what point you felt your portfolio started to take off? Hi guys. I always read that ""the first $100.000 is a bitch"" but you have to do it. After that, with the right mindset, it will take off"". Either it's true or not, at what point in your portfolio you felt that your portfolio started to ""fly""? Thanks"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I just crossed 100 invested in my main brokerage account and the average daily swing is over $1k now. Kinda crazy. 

Things have really accelerated since I got rid of student loans."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Having heard that ""first 100k is a bitch"" statement many times - just going to chime in that it was a shift in perceptions towards money which paved the way for my portfolio's growth.

At about the 100k mark... any comparative feelings towards those in proximity seemed moot (Currently 32, working as a research analyst - but going to do a PhD or second master's soon!)

Guess if there had to be a number associated with the moment growth started to compound visibly - would be around 62k ish.

The initial 8-20k was difficult simply due to wanting to spend it on a car downpayment or something.... I had to learn to ""love"" money and change my field of view, think sunglasses in the movie ""they live"".

Budgeting and going FI was a lot easier in the west with less overt peer pressure- after moving to the Far East with an image based society i've found *everything* and *everyone* is scrutinized. 

You do get better treatment for pulling out a credit card over a debit, and a Rolex over a G shock. Dig a little deeper though and most of the locals are just winging it!"
03/18/2021,stocks,Still waiting :D
03/18/2021,stocks,I started investing in January and I’m currently down 22%. The more I learn about stocks the more I come to realise how dumb I am.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Wait, your portfolios are taking off??"
03/18/2021,stocks,I’m with you
03/18/2021,stocks,"""The first million is the hardest"", they told me. So I decided to start with the second."
03/18/2021,stocks,"This is one of those ""2020 has warped peoples minds about the markets"" questions.

Your portfolio may never really ""take off"". It shouldn't really work like that. If you invest in good companies you should see consistent growth over the years. There won't be a single moment where it jumps like crazy and then stays there. Consistent gains is what you're looking for.

Eventually, you'll get to the point where the day to day or even week to week doesn't matter anymore. My long term hold portfolio is littered with stocks I've owned for 5+ years that I have no intention of selling. Even though I spend all day watching the markets, I rarely check in on those stocks because I know they're good companies that will continue to grow."
03/18/2021,stocks,"In all honesty it’s a moving target. 

Depending on your starting point $1000 might seem almost impossible.  

Then it’s $10,000

Then it’s $20,000

Then it’s $50,000

Then it’s $100,000

Then it’s $200,000

Then it’s $500,000

Then it’s $1,000,000

I can’t speak past a million, but I assume when I break a million, the next point will be $2,000,000, then $5,000,000

About 7-10 years with average market returns you double your money. Hence why it feels like a block."
03/18/2021,stocks,It got fun when I started generating $1000 a month from dividends.
03/18/2021,stocks,"At $100,000 invested, an 8% gain is more money than you can contribute to a Roth IRA so that's a great feeling.  If you max it out you contribute $6,000 of hard earned after tax dollars, but another $8,000 goes in and you didn't have to lift a finger, so you see it working for you.  I'm over $700,000 now and an 8% gain just about doubles my yearly take home pay for the year.  I feel like it has taken off."
03/18/2021,stocks,"$200K was that point for me.  I think it is related to how much you can save a year from your job.  When you can make that or a significant part of that from your existing portfolio then it seems like you are making what you think of as a lot of money for ""free.""  Also you tend to initially think of net worth accumulation in terms of your savings rate.  For example if you are saving $20K a year then $100K seems like it will be five years of work; when you add $20K a year plus another $20K from your existing portfolio then that next $100K comes much faster, and it seems like you are making huge progress compared to what comes from just your job.

I currently save $60K/year and the rate of accumulation is crazy compared to what it was during my first job."
03/18/2021,stocks,We already had a strong correction. Powell’s press hearing yesterday was also good news.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Started feb 1st, up 8%, doesn't say much yet but its going the right way so far haha"
03/18/2021,stocks,lol. each day I pray it doesn't nose dive to nothing.
03/18/2021,stocks,Im 22 now but I have calculated a plan to get 100k by the time that Im 40. Hopefully then I can start to see some larger gains to help me retire earlier than 70.
03/18/2021,stocks,"As of March 2020 you could have had invested into literally anything and your portfolio would have taken off. At this point I feel like a crash is inevitable to make room for growth again, as the market is pretty much oversaturated."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Getting from 10k to 100k is just as easy or difficult as getting from 100k to 1mil mathematically obviously.

I think people may think it is easier because by the time you are at 100k you likely have a better paying job, less debts and a more stable financial situation so you are able to invest more money than when you only had 10k invested."
03/18/2021,stocks,"the first 100k is easy, the first million is hard, 5m is harder 10m even hardest.

what do you mean at what point? you see numbers go up and you stay with the trade. that's it. no emotions"
03/18/2021,stocks,What is ‘take off’? Theres no point where you money somehow increases at a faster rate because of the amount. Maybe people just feel a sense of security once they reach 100k?
03/18/2021,stocks,Only you can answer that question. Nobody knows your financial situation well enough to know how much of a gain is meaningful to you.
03/18/2021,stocks,I felt like after $5k I really noticed the dividends from VOO and such - at 20k now and still slow but it's always accelerating while you're adding. $50+ quarterly from dividends helps but it's hardly flying.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I sat out 2020 but started trading in Jan 2021 and got super lucky with GME, FLGT, RKT and TMDX. Now hoping for TPGY to close the merger with EVBox."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Honestly I put 15k into AAPL, AMZN, and AAPL at the end of 2018 and didn’t look at my stocks again until 2020 when stuff started crashing and I was like “hm I should buy more things.”

Buying and forgetting really good companies has probably been much better for me than the constant monitoring I’ve done over the last 6 months of buying and selling and buying and selling."
03/18/2021,stocks,When I brought CCL
03/18/2021,stocks,I would say 50k for me. At that point I could put enough into a new stock that it felt worth it. Your dividends are higher too and things start to roll. When I hit 50 I very soon hit 80 much faster than expected (may have been just a good year too) and onwards etc.
03/18/2021,stocks,When I bought GOEV
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I felt that from 100k on. When 1% is 1k, things start to get real. Especially when you live of half of that for a month."
03/18/2021,stocks,"When I realized my portfolio was going up or down ~10k some days, but it didn’t bother me, that’s when I was like “oh huh yea the portfolio really has grown”

Doesn’t really change what I do now though, I buy into positions with the same amount every week, and do my work and hobbies in the mean time."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I think my first pick was aapl in like 2013.  Rode it up my first year of college and made a cool profit but nothing big.  Around 2016 I got lucky on a weed stock pick and that wrongly gave me more confidence in my methodology, but over the next few years I picked several actual winners (cgnx, ebs) and my portfolio started to take off."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I don't think its an amount of money, but an amount of time. Tons of new investors in the last year during a crazy time. Markets dropped a ton but came back super strong, so people invest  and want to double their money in like 3-6 months again, but that's not going to happen.

I'm the same way, checking my portfolio too often, wanting to make the big gains, etc. (fuck options atm, too scary, practicing with papermoney currently). But it takes a lot of time for the gains and compounding returns. 

So I don't expect a huge increase in a year, but after 5 years or 10 years, you can easily 2-3x your money. So just be patient, make smart moves, don't follow the hype, and do your DD. In time you will have a lot of money.

Not financial advice, I barely know what I'm doing but this is the mindset I am trying to take."
03/18/2021,stocks,I didn’t start investing until like 5 years ago and was contributing an average of $2000 a week with a few big deposits thrown in.  This definitely help my portfolio grow rapidly but most was due to contribution rather than growth.  Currently my portfolio is around the $600k range and I noticed these days that my weekly contribution rarely have any effects on my overall portfolio that much.  This should be when you noticed your portfolio is taken off imo.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I think there’s some truth to it. The more money you have, the easier it is to make more money."
03/18/2021,stocks,"i don't get this statement. As it's all relative.
Probably referring to Dividend stocks that you reinvest back into more dividends."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Around 300k when it just explodes, going from 0 to 300k and 300k to 1 mil takes same time if you max 401k and earn same return

Up to first 100k focus on saving money because that’s where most increase comes from

Most energy better spent on building career / making more money then going insane over what to invest in"
03/18/2021,stocks,I'm dumping money into student loans right now and man it's gonna be like a massive raise when I'm done by years end.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah the bigger your account is, the more drastic the swings are. My account swings about 10-20K a day on average now. Its more than my salary"
03/18/2021,stocks,In that club lol
03/18/2021,stocks,Go all into VT and never touch your stocks
03/18/2021,stocks,You have portfolio*s*??
03/18/2021,stocks,"> Your portfolio may never really ""take off"". It shouldn't really work like that. 

Compound interest. I think this is what the OP is referring to. After years and years compounding causes the portfolio to go vertical. While you’re only getting about 7% a year, it feels like it “takes off” due to the high amount invested. Eventually the portfolio grows more than you can put money into it, aka the snowball."
03/18/2021,stocks,At some point the yearly returns become greater than your annual salary and it just sort of takes off from there. For example plot say a 401k with max contributions and an average 6-10% return and look at the curve. Starts fairly flat then rockets up.
03/18/2021,stocks,Exactly. It's kinda crazy how quickly people forgot about 2018.
03/18/2021,stocks,what stocks are you currently positioned in?  i'm trying to diversify after getting hosed from the march correction into dividend stocks.
03/18/2021,stocks,"This, it’s not your returns that help it take off, it’s your saving rate.  

If you have 100k portfolio and can save 10% a year, if your portfolio gains 10% a year, then it really starts to zoom.  If you increase your savings to 20-30k a year, then you are outpacing your returns, and it’s a this point it “takes off”."
03/18/2021,stocks,"""strong correction""? The correction from last month was a blip. The Nasdaq fell like 12% but the DOW and S&P barely dropped. What we saw was nothing."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Well, I hope not. I just started investing in January 2021 and I’m only down 5%"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I agree, but I don’t think the new administration would “allow” the first sign of a major correction to occur in the first six months, much less a market crash, especially when we are at the end of the covid tunnel.

Again, when the lights are on and music stops, don’t be the guy who’s holding the bag."
03/18/2021,stocks,Agreed
03/18/2021,stocks,I think he means when do you get to the point where the rate of change amounts to gains (or losses) that are a meaningful amount of purchase power.
03/18/2021,stocks,why not wait for the inevitable inflation?
03/18/2021,stocks,I am just praying the administration does something to lessen student loan burden
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm 80% into VTI, 10% QQQ, 10% AAPL. I plan on putting in $2,000 a year into VTI over the course of the next 25 years. It's not much in comparison to what some people do, but oh well."
03/18/2021,stocks,You have money??
03/18/2021,stocks,I hope to god I see that snowball one day
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah because market movers jumped out of tech and back into things that will profit from opening up the country. So those exchanges got more support.

Edit:spelling"
03/18/2021,stocks,If you have conviction in the companies you invested it just average down.
03/18/2021,stocks,"If you're suggesting that I'm not taking the absolute smartest path by aggressively paying it down I agree with you. However, it's a private loan and I can't time the market. As it stands, by the time inflation inevitably starts impacting daily life, I'll hope to be more directly pumping my funds into the market.

The allure of debt freedom is a bit more worth it to me than getting the absolute best bang for my buck, personally"
03/18/2021,stocks,This may be the stupidest financial advice I've read on reddit all day.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm all private loans rest of the way unfortunately, but I sincerely hope forgiveness comes because I need my fellow millennials to believe in and invest in their futures. That dream is good for all of us."
03/18/2021,stocks,Nah that’s great! Keep it up
03/18/2021,stocks,Agreed - but that doesn't make it a 'strong correction'.
03/18/2021,stocks,for sure. EXAS is great so far.
03/18/2021,stocks,I agree wholeheartedly.  I'm a big fan of controlling the controllable.  The psychological benefit of getting my loan off my books was well worth it to me.
03/18/2021,stocks,I think inflation would make your loans worthless.
03/18/2021,stocks,"explain why, and don’t use sarcasm"
03/18/2021,stocks,What's your major and how much left you got to pay
03/18/2021,stocks,12% is pretty fat lol
03/18/2021,stocks,"Killed my student loans just in time to start investing in this terrible market.

It is seriously a weight off though, stocks'll probably go up eventually, I don't have any debt and that's great."
03/18/2021,stocks,"That would be hyperinflation and wed all be fucked if that happens. Inflation just makes them worth less, not worthless."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Assuming my income continues to outpace inflation as well as the money that would be going to the loan also outpaces inflation, then yes.

Again, I'm not suggesting I'm using every dollar I make the most efficiently. But I'm using it better today than I was a year ago even, so I'll take it."
03/18/2021,stocks,"EDIT Fuck it. Not worth it. 

There was absolutely no sarcasm in my post."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I have an arts major that gets little use in the construction field I've found myself in, and $10k left to pay off."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah, but it wasn’t a market correction, it was simply a tech (and bloated tech) correction.  And a relatively small one at that.

I think considering the overall market didn’t really drop at all, it really shows with the freak out last month how terrible people have built their portfolios against their risk tolerances."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Considering its only actually considered a correction by definition after the 10% mark and was only in tech, by definition it was a moderate to weak tech correction

Not strong, and not a total market correction. Semantics are pretty important in this case"
03/18/2021,stocks,Where are you getting the idea that this is a terrible market?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Well, people were worrying about inflation"
03/18/2021,stocks,"nobody is talking about avoiding paying it off dude, just not making huge payments on it. i inferred from what he said to mean he was paying significantly more than whatever his monthly payment is, rushing to pay it off during heavy economic uncertainty (not to mention a full house of democrats who supposedly want to help with student loans). if inflation actually stays course then sure, but i don’t see that happening"
03/18/2021,stocks,But part of the freak out was what the feds response was going to be and it was positive per Powell’s last speech.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Because interest.

The average student loan is $28,400. Let's use an interest rate of 4.66% and make the loan duration 10 years.

That's a payment of $297 a month.

You will end up paying $35,583 for the entire loan. **That is $7183 that you are paying in interest over the life of your loan.**

That is **25%** the amount of loan just stacked on top for nothing really.

We are hovering at about 2% inflation.

How are you going to offset the interest payment with 2% inflation?

And please realistic. We are not headed to hyperinflation."
2021-03-18 13:57:06,stocks,"How soon would ARK have to liquidate its holdings upon investor outflow? ARK is super susceptible to a crash.

Are there certain funds you think are safer or more vulnerable than others? I’m in ARKF and ARKG, but anything with a big weight in Tesla scares me a bit. Cathie and ARK seem so controversial lately.

03/18/2021,stocks,"No disrespect, but I don’t understand how you reach such a level of conviction about something you admittedly don’t know anything about. Behavior is context driven, so if you’re going to attempt to predict behavior, it follows that you need context. Yet, you eschew it.

I admit I’m skeptical of TA. To me, it’s full of confirmation and recency bias that undermine its credibility. Every forecast is subject to revision with the most recent data, but when the most recent data are critical to the performance of the model, it’s not very useful as a predictor. 

For example, the notion of resistance levels and such only supposedly tells me something useful if certain conditions are met. I care far less about what will happen if prices break through a certain level than I do toward which level the prices will move. If it goes down, it will go down more, but if it goes up, it will go up more. I don’t find that particularly helpful. It’s like telling me it will rain a lot if it starts raining, but it will be sunny so long as it’s sunny by 10:00 AM, but only until it’s cloudy again.

The confirmation bias comes from the notion that movement due to TA is a self-fulfilling prophecy because TA are all relying on the same charts and metrics and interpreting them in the same way. When the outcome is not an independent variable, the whole model is compromised.

I’d be happy to be convinced differently, especially if I’m not understanding something properly or not considering something important. I have just never been able to justify a prediction that’s not driver-based. Black box methods are fine if they demonstrate reliable predictive value, but no one ought to settle for leaving it at that and not researching and analyzing the principal components and their relationships, because that’s how knowledge is advanced and shared.

I’m comfortable assuming Cathie and her team have done research that tells them some things I don’t know, and I’ll always take that over attempting to infer actionable signals from short term patterns reflecting the actions of herds of irrational traders with imperfect information."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Much of the volume on ARKs main holdings are down double in volume. That cant be a good thing. If you look at the chart on almost any of ARKs stocks the charts are identical, even across sectors and industries. Recently Ive noticed her liquidating huge portions of blue chip stocks. It appears shes been using this cash to pump ZM, Teladoc, Square etc If you do the math, her pumps on her holdings almost match the amount of the liquidations over the same period of time."

03/18/2021,stocks,"I do not believe it is pump shop but I just do not get some of her logic when she speaks on some stocks - my life in corporate America and growing up on the streets has my BS antenna go up when she speaks.

03/18/2021,stocks,"it is ridiculous. But its worked for the last 50 or so options trades Ive made. Yes you heard that right, Ive made almost 50 or more options buys and everyone of them was a huge gainer."
03/18/2021,stocks,What's your reading on Palantir's CEO ?
03/18/2021,stocks,"I agree its not a pump, their team just seems good at picking up trends for now."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I get what youre saying. Theres evidence both ways. I just have found more evidence that says its a pump shop operation. Check out Cathiesark charts, maybe it will change your mind"
03/18/2021,stocks,Highly probable you will go to zero with that overconfidence.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I purposely watched the last earnings call because I think they have a unique position and could be long term hold but when the CEO started rambling about the company walking in the Colorado snow - I just thought tomyself UFB never seen anything like this from a CEO.     

Then they only had $5M in new contracts for the quarter and they said they would have 30% CAGR - I could not believe them - I guess it the new math; thus I decide to wait until next earnings to see if would put any of my money on them."
03/18/2021,stocks,"No idea. Ive bought Palantir once, made a quick 10% and I was out an hour later."
03/18/2021,stocks,"> Cathiesark charts -  

Thanks just looked - did not realize she traded that much - I would love to see her tax adjusted returns."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm not confident. These are options youre talking about. Options are a fucking rollercoaster from hell. I hedged as much as I could. Ive got some far otm bets, but mostly surer bets on stocks near their peak, with high p/e and no profits."
03/18/2021,stocks,Yep. I'd expect a different style from a company with their military/security establishment connections. But I've been called old-fashioned before.
03/18/2021,stocks,The hairs on the back of my neck went up - thinking the same thing !!!  Good Luck.

03/18/2021,stocks,Why can't the market decide whether they give a shit about bond yields?

03/18/2021,stocks,The real question is: how far will the bond rate continue to grow? I haven’t seen anyone trying to predict it. So far it looks pretty random.
03/18/2021,stocks,Was I stupid to buy some amd today?
03/18/2021,stocks," So because we are having an inflation (obviously, due to brrrrrrrrr), bond rate needs to go up to cope with inflation and that leads to another tech sell off because it's getting more expensive to borrow money especially for those start-up tech companies since they are just burning cash in the first few years until they are able to generate steady cash flow? And that would lead to bad earning numbers...."

Why is it one of the most shorted on the street? Anyways fuck bond yields. Looks like another day of just buying the dip and tuning out of the market.
03/18/2021,stocks,Looks like a lot of stocks are going on sale today.

Despite a solid 25% of my portfolio being tech, I'm green today carried by the above and my gamble on cannabis. I'm staying out of tech for the rest of the year tbh. Just saying. I'm new and dumb btw."
03/18/2021,stocks,Mastercard is absolutely thrashing me.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Watch for the double bottom in the Nasdaq. In the first go-around a few weeks back we hit 12600. Like the double bottom during the September correction, I don't expect us to head that deep again. But I would not be shocked if we dipped under 13000 one more time in the coming weeks before this corrective period finally (mercifully) concludes. Something in the 12900s sounds about right."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Everything drops when SPY drops, then everything doesnt recover thats not in SPY on the rebound. CRSR is such a joke. Been bagholding @ 34 dollars for a month. Lmao. This stock is so fucking undervalued its killing me."

03/18/2021,stocks,"For anyone that was here between March 2020 and January 2021, what was it like? Really, all I know are fat red dicks slapping my face everyday. God forbid we have two green consecutive days."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Hey guys, I think some of you need to calm down a little. I know red days really suck, but what we actually see is an overreaction of the market (economy is recovering too fast so market gets scarred..wtf?!). So better not make your desissions in an act of panic (stick to your plan and rely on your DD). And my crystal ball tells me that stocks will be green again 😁 (maybe not tomorrow but they will)"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I keep buying AAPL on the dip, any other places worth looking so I dont put all my dip eggs in one basket?"
03/18/2021,stocks,Looks like one of those days where I don’t check this subreddit or my portfolio. See you all for a hopefully better tomorrow.
03/18/2021,stocks,I bought Costco as part of an effort to diversify away from tech but it just moves the same as a tech stock... why? 🤦‍♂️

Or not 🤷🏾‍♂️"
03/18/2021,stocks,Is it me or is this dip a bit ridiculous? I remember APPS crashing down to 60. If it goes back to that I’ll buy shit tons. This is just a blip.

03/18/2021,stocks,"Newbie question: why does VIX spike when there is a sell-off but not when the index spike up? Isn’t a “volatility” measure, i.e change in price over a period of time?"

03/18/2021,stocks,"Wtf happened today? Also what dip to buy tomorrow? Thinking DIS, ABNB or get into some uranium positions"
03/18/2021,stocks,I'm going to really miss 2020's market...
03/18/2021,stocks,Well I just lost all of my gains this week. How's your day going?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Don't be paper handed during this perfectly healthy time of volatility. Eventually this yield escalation will flatten out and the market will appear massively oversold. It may take another week or two, but all this selling is setting the market up for a massive meltup as we move into spring and summer, IMO. In the meantime, keep your buy list fresh and handy, and look for a double bottom as the optimal entry point for these amazing tech stocks going on fire sale. We may not get as low as we did a few weeks ago when the market puked up last, since so many people missed that previous bottom. But be prepared to pounce when the market sells off in a big way in the next few weeks. These are dips worth buying ahead of the full economic reopening.

TL;DR: Be patient and tactical."
03/18/2021,stocks,"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7okje/shout_to_ulampzworldwg22_who_borrowed_money_from/

Okay, maybe we are *slightly* in some sort of bubble."
03/18/2021,stocks,"By all appearances tomorrow could be the double bottom we've been waiting for. Get your buy list ready. Think about what blue chippers and/or speculative stocks you want to purchase — and for what price — when everything goes on fire sale. And remember: bottoms happen faster than tops. They tend to snap back in the opposite direction quite quickly. Remember that Friday a few weeks back? We went from a bottoming out to a face-ripping rally in about 2 hours. I expect similar when we do bottom again.

The [last bond yield scare like this](https://money.cnn.com/2016/12/30/investing/dow-stocks-2016-trump/index.html) also featured a double bottom of similar nature, as did the correction last September. And both fueled new rallies for ATHs. This stretch of volatility will likely also lead into a rally, probably around the beginning of April. Be patient, be tactical, and buy what you can while the market is puking up the best bargains."
03/18/2021,stocks,"How fucked are we? A review.

**Technically Speaking**

- We broke through our support line

- We dropped low enough to officially call this a bull trap

- Our next major support line is at the NASDAQ 12,609, which means we're looking at another 4% drop bare minimum

**Fundamentally Speaking**

Next week, we have:

**Monday: New Homes Sales data reported**

We already know that new home building permits have dropped an [unexpected 11%](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-home-construction-falters-due-to-februarys-winter-storms-but-support-for-a-home-building-frenzy-remains-11615985107?mod=economic-report), so this isn't looking good.

**Tuesday: Current account deficit and existing home sales**

Homes, again, can't be good.

Our deficit was 25% larger than expected in the last budget, and that was before the $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill.

**Wednesday: Goods orders and manufacturing data**

Retail sales were [6X worse than expected](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/16/retail-february-commerce-sales/), so this ain't looking good.

**Thursday: Jobless claims**

Today's said 770,000 *additional* people are ~~still~~ unemployed, which is much worse than anyone was expecting.

**Friday: Personal income and consumer spending data**

Once again, retail sales were 6X worse than expected this week.

Strap in.

What I mean is that not all tech is the same, and some of it may even profit. Up till now, my logic seems flawed as $APPL is dropping same as the other stonks."

03/18/2021,stocks,"**Stock Market Weather Forecast**

We are not out of the woods yet.

NASDAQ and the tech stocks associated with it have been zig-zagging downward. We zig down, we zag up, but each zag up is a little bit lower than the last.

On our last big zag up before the current one, the NASDAQ reached 13,600. We haven't beaten that yet. We tried yesterday, we tried the day before, and we tried last night at midnight, but we failed every time. Which is a problem, because we need to beat that or else this could just be another zag up on a big drop down.

Jobless claims are higher than expected. JPow is talking again today. Bond yields are skyrocketing.

I think we'll get through this and that we're on the road back -- but today's going to be a buying opportunity, not a profit-taking one.

Today is going to be a red day with a NASDAQ high of 13,522 and a low of 13,281 -- and I'm probably being too optimistic with that one."

if I understand it correctly if interest rates go up it means their revenue go down and if interest rates stay near zero their revenue will go up ?

why does that happen and no the other way around, I mean logically if interest rate is high then they generate more revenue right ? or does it mean that people will take less loans if interest rates are high ?"

Since opening up my positions during the early Feb highs, I've been refining my portfolio slowly to better match the long term strategy I want as opposed to the short term gain chasing that forums can drive.  I started out too tech + green energy heavy, and have sold some of the positions that I didn't feel as strongly about, put a stronger percentage into a world-tracking etf, and branched out to a few more solid sectors.

Only thing I'm still bagholding on is CRSR @ 38 - and I'm happy to wait a while on that one to see if it can come back up after lockup ends next week."
03/18/2021,stocks,I feel you. It only hurts more when people start asking you how you’re doing and all you can say is my portfolio is sinking and I’m buying dips the entire time meh.
03/18/2021,stocks,You DCA your speculative stocks but try to time VTI? That's backwards.

03/18/2021,stocks,Everything red...except AMC is the one lonely green on my watchlist. Like it's mocking me lol
03/18/2021,stocks,It's okay it will probably come back down in the morning
03/18/2021,stocks,They also went up 100%+ in a year.
03/18/2021,stocks,"with the crazy run up before said flat, they could flat for 3 more years and still be wildly profitable investments."
03/18/2021,stocks,Tim apple just chilling rn

Most funds have already took their money outs weeks ago."
03/18/2021,stocks,"The reactions are getting more muted as we go, as long as the SLR exemption gets extended, you likely have one more trading week to go before you could quite possibly see another grind up that lasts months.

If nothing is done though, then well, welp."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Industrials was always the better value choice.

It has no secular decline issues, and it isn't as prone to bank-specific crises."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I feel the same way. Glad I sold my XOM early this week, but I still have a lot of other energy that's taking a beating. One oddity I have is KMI, which is weird, because it's fine while another similar company, EPD is taking a beating."
03/18/2021,stocks,"When did you buy?

Those of us who bought in November are extremely happy."
03/18/2021,stocks,algorithms unironically
03/18/2021,stocks,"Still a solid growth company, me and me 50 shares are not rly worried."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Where are you seeing it's the insiders selling?  I was thinking about putting a little more into NET tomorrow, but maybe i'll hold off."
03/18/2021,stocks,Dam I thought it was even undervalued around $70
03/18/2021,stocks,*AMD stocks only go down 😓
03/18/2021,stocks,Looks like you're heading to the moon.

This has been a week of brutal, brutal news.

The only real good news has been J. Powell showing that inflation hasn't hit us yet -- but with the stimulus checks approved, it's extremely likely that inflation is coming amidst worsening economic conditions."
03/18/2021,stocks,It doesn't give a shit about bond yields per se...just the velocity (how quickly they go up). Yields go up quickly -> market tanks -> yields stabilise -> market recovers -> yields go up quickly again -> market tanks etc etc.
03/18/2021,stocks,That's the trillion dollar question the market is trying to determine.
03/18/2021,stocks,People are saying it'll end up around 2%. So expect that to be totally wrong lol
03/18/2021,stocks,It was 3 in 2017-2019 lol so like as interest rates rise the equities cool. It’s pretty normal
03/18/2021,stocks,"Was I stupid to buy anything today when everything I bought dropped FURTHER in the red? Stock was already down 10%, I buy, it drops further. Wtf."
03/18/2021,stocks,"No I’m jealous of your price, I’m holding 150 shares at $92 🤦🏻‍♀️"
03/18/2021,stocks,Only if you're not long.
03/18/2021,stocks,I lost so much fckin money buying the dip considering things have been dipping for a whole month
03/18/2021,stocks,"I mean if you're averaging down then it should work out long term, provided you're not trying to catch a falling knife."

03/18/2021,stocks,the whole market is red
03/18/2021,stocks,I just did this
03/18/2021,stocks,"Define medium term.

For some people it’s 6 months. For others it’s 3-5 years."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Smart man. I think people have wised up about ICLN, but I still see a lot of talk on here about PLTR being a good ""long term"" investment.

The truth is that neither of those have a very good chance of beating the market anytime soon. In 5-10 years, maybe... but also maybe not, and it makes very little sense to hold onto something that long for the slim chance that it may perform well someday."
03/18/2021,stocks,How long were you in PLTR and ICLN?
03/18/2021,stocks,Which ones are you in
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yup. Down 8% for the day.

So much for yesterday's rally!"
03/18/2021,stocks,Jesus
03/18/2021,stocks,Weeeeeeeeeeeee
03/18/2021,stocks,Only sector that's doing well today is the financial one.
03/18/2021,stocks,10yr bond yields went up
03/18/2021,stocks,"Keep in mind if it was possible to be sure tomorrow will be ultra red, the market would have fell way more than that today. The truth is nobody can be 100% sure what will happen tomorrow.


I expect a red day too, but i also know my attempts at timing the market are generally going to be bad ideas, so i'm just holding my positions and riding the waves. For example, if i was a market timer, i think i'd have sold before Jpow speech, and probably bought back once i saw his effect was positive...."
03/18/2021,stocks,No. I went and looked at the indexes from past quad witching dates and nothing happened.
03/18/2021,stocks,I have 100 shares too. Currently bag holding (bought way too high) but I’ve lowered my cost basis $6 so far by selling covered calls since the premiums are so great. I decided yesterday that I’ll also start wheeling it weekly at this new lower price. I sold a $37 CSP yesterday and if I’m assigned tomorrow then I’ll sell covered calls to get out next week and then I will keep repeating. If the premiums weren’t so high I wouldn’t feel as ok about this as I do now. Good luck!
03/18/2021,stocks,Everyone thought they were so good at making money and predicting what’s the hottest stock. In reality you can throw a dart to pick random stocks and still make money
03/18/2021,stocks,Long story short stonks only went up.
03/18/2021,stocks,DIS
03/18/2021,stocks,See y’all in 2 - 3 weeks is my attitude rn
03/18/2021,stocks,Weeeeee!
03/18/2021,stocks,12%
03/18/2021,stocks,Do you think a lot has to do with how dominant Tech is in our portfolios?
03/18/2021,stocks,"20%.

I felt better when I was up 7% yesterday and now down 8% today LOL"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Im probably up two percent or something, i am mainly invested in stupid shit and tech stocks protected by the chinese communist party"
03/18/2021,stocks,Almost down 6% today. I was up a lot this week before so this mostly reversed those gains.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I went all in on Bitcoin and related stocks, so either way I win."
03/18/2021,stocks,10% for me
03/18/2021,stocks,8.5% PLTR and NIO keeping my BAM gains in the gutters. Also AAPL has been up and down for me. I'd like that to stop. I don't have any more cash to DCA at the moment.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yes, yes, and yes."
03/18/2021,stocks,2020 wasn't looking to hot at this point in the year either.
03/18/2021,stocks,you had gains?
03/18/2021,stocks,I think we've seen the lows. The rest of the volatility is just froth. 💎🙌 Just hold your nose and wait for the volatility to stop and things will look better.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Everything is priced in at this point.  Buy the rumor, sell the news.  A week isn't going to change much.

Tech stocks are at risk for a number of reasons, but especially because work from home is going to either be limited or eliminated at a lot of companies going forward.  Then you have rising rates to consider.  Now 1.74%.  And on top of that a lot of other companies hammered by covid are now legitimate alternatives for investment.  The Nasdaq rose considerably due to work from home.  Not sure that continues.

There are multiple headwinds."
03/18/2021,stocks,People should not be looking at tech stocks this year dude.
03/18/2021,stocks,What do you think of trimming a little now and buying later in the hopes that the market will drop further. I've been expected a big drop for days now but nasdaq seems to have mostly exhausted the downward pressure.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Interested to hear your opinion on the timeline for this, I know you’ll definitely have some cash in reserve for some buying in the next few weeks, but do you not think we go as low as the previous drop? Either way, this choppy movement looks perfect for another drop imo,

Thinking last week of March for the best buying opportunities"
03/18/2021,stocks,I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER!
03/18/2021,stocks,"Do you think tomorrow over next week / last week in March? I could see that being the case, that acceleration into the close was rather scary."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm glad I invest and don't trade.  I'm in for another 15-20 years so a few months of volatility or an ongoing bear market isn't a big deal.

Market goes down, I contribute.  Market goes up, I contribute.  Freaking out and selling shares for cash I don't need is ridiculous.

Just buckle up and enjoy the ride if you're investing in the long term."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Oddly enough, do you think this bad news next week bode well for tech? Wouldn't these dimmer economic outlooks cause less of a concern of the stimulus causing inflation since the economy clearly needs it, and thus cause bond yield to drop, thus tech goes up?"
03/18/2021,stocks,">Today's said 770,000 people are still unemployed, which is much worse than anyone was expecting.

IIRC, today's news was that 770,000 more people went on unemployment, which was considerably higher than expected."
03/18/2021,stocks,"If you had to guess what Nasdaq will close at on the 26th, what would it be?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Did we hit 12,609 support in early March?"
03/18/2021,stocks,1.73%. big jump
03/18/2021,stocks,QQQ is a good one to slowly enter now and buy on red days.
03/18/2021,stocks,I love my VTI
03/18/2021,stocks,"Sometimes shorting isn’t about bad fundamentals, it’s that stocks get overbought and a sell-off is predicted."
03/18/2021,stocks,Not really
03/18/2021,stocks,"No, but during times of high volatility (like now) it can end up not producing the returns you want. There are some videos that explain the drawback of volatility on daily leveraged etfs like this. Because I had the same idea as you about a month ago"
03/18/2021,stocks,I just bought some TQQQ in aftermarket for 86.02. Lets see what happens!  (only 1% of my portfolio)
03/18/2021,stocks,I think lower. I’m going to try to hold out until Monday/Tuesday
03/18/2021,stocks,IMO I think oil was overhyped when tech crashed. Now oil deserves a correction.
03/18/2021,stocks,The sale was today.
03/18/2021,stocks,Your sanity will improve once you accept that you'll **NEVER** buy at the bottom and sell at the top.  The top and bottom are influenced by many factors beyond anyone's control.  You'll have a successful investment career and come out ahead than most as long as your selling price is **HIGHER** than your buying price on average in the long run.  Stop stressing over missing the top or bottom.
03/18/2021,stocks,Go for a walk.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Tech and clean energy are the future, they’ve also exploded in the last 12 months. Since then all the memes and new investors popped in. Expect more blood this year. You should have your horizon 10 years out"
03/18/2021,stocks,"They're the obvious stocks to sell during an inflation scare. Once this period passes and the media narrative/emotional trading shifts into growth again (in 2-3 weeks, likely) those stocks will pick right back up. In the meantime, don't sell, because the big guys are hoping retail investors will paper hand and create better buying opportunities for when the tech buying spree does begin again."
03/18/2021,stocks,They are hoping we sell and jump into value so they can buy tech cheap before the recovery pops off.
03/18/2021,stocks,I want to get of the bond market's wild ride.
03/18/2021,stocks,Thinking about buying today or market close Friday? I'm torn
03/18/2021,stocks,I admire the optimism :D.
03/18/2021,stocks,Sold that bitch a long time ago
03/18/2021,stocks,All my homies hate ICLN.
03/18/2021,stocks,"ICLN has been a valuable lesson for me to do a lot more DD on ETF's. ICLN is filled with so much shit that has ran up too much to have value over a long period of time. 

We've been ICLEANED OUT, the PLUG has been pulled"
03/18/2021,stocks,Seriously. I’ve analyzed my positions and if I would have sold multiple things at a slight loss and re bought lower positions when they continue to drop I would be up overall instead of down
03/18/2021,stocks,"Bout all you can do is pick a good company and let it sit. The best I’ve ever done is not looking at anything and putting money in regularly. I guess if you want to day trade you have to pay more attention but I’m not good at it. I’d have probably wanted to sell yesterday morning to save my gains, and then it turned on a dime so I just pay attention to the day to day other than seeing how the whole market is, and I come here to get an idea how everyone is feeling."
03/18/2021,stocks,All media is that way? It's basically mindcontrol
03/18/2021,stocks,It’s all complete bs. It’s all just fake news. Nobody cares about bonds. Nobody.
03/18/2021,stocks,Most of the best plays I've ever done was because I understood the company's business model. Understanding your end goal and the company's  business model is more important than news.
03/18/2021,stocks,This won’t last much longer in my opinion. A lot of recovery stocks are back to their normal levels but I would definitely reconsider some solar holdings unless you don’t mind waiting potentially a long time to see some green again
03/18/2021,stocks,UA has some clutch socks though
03/18/2021,stocks,Europe bad at vaccine maybe
03/18/2021,stocks,what
03/18/2021,stocks,Generally diversified ones. Voo and VTI are popular
03/18/2021,stocks,I'd normally say VTI like the other guy but apparently in 2021 its DIA lol
03/18/2021,stocks,LMT and ITA. cause “war” is likely in our near future
03/18/2021,stocks,Tobacco stocks. Low valuations and pricing power.

03/18/2021,stocks,The entire market is a self fulfilling prophecy.
03/18/2021,stocks,DCF...ever hear of it? When discount rate goes ⬆️ high PE bubble stocks go 💥
03/18/2021,stocks,"They matter because it means inflation is coming if it isn’t here already. The yield curve is spiking which means we’re on track to blow past JPows 2% goal and that means the fed could be forced to raise the prime rate. This means: slowing the recovery, rotation out of high risk stocks to bonds, tech companies can’t borrow as much to grow, and the housing boom grinds to a halt."
03/18/2021,stocks,There is a fucking novel worth of things retail traders get fucked on. That is a huge one though

03/18/2021,stocks,You think hyperinflation is a joke?  Get bitcoin now.  Not financial advice.
03/18/2021,stocks,It was one of the most hated SPACs (GHIV) for a reason. Nothing but a bad company.
03/18/2021,stocks,The fact that it's popular among the WSB crowd should tell you everything you need to know.
03/18/2021,stocks,Long term may be ok. On the riskier side imo
03/18/2021,stocks,I don't see any news or rumors from them but it keeps being mentioned in WSB for no reason
03/18/2021,stocks,"sit away is the best way, lol."
03/18/2021,stocks,"SCHD and DVY even better :-)

These have been among my best investments since the vaccine was announced.  Great funds."
03/18/2021,stocks,"No one can tell you what to do, go ahead! But diversification can greatly help your risk adjusted expected return. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXWYpVjMVsA) a great video on the subject."
03/18/2021,stocks,DCAing things like AAPL and DIS seem like smart plays tbh. I will not be DCAing my volatile tech stocks though. AAPL and DIS just represent nice times to buy into what's basically a savings account.
03/18/2021,stocks,There's a reddit thread posted on this subreddit nearly every day by a dedicated user.
03/18/2021,stocks,Marketplace podcast on spotify with Kai Ryssdal is my go-to if I'm busy doing things. Straight to the point news stories about the markets with no real editorialized takes. Just information that's easy to digest.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Lovely, but I’m shook on tech atm"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Unless you think a company is fundamentally doomed, there's no sense in panic selling when it's down."
03/18/2021,stocks,Nothing I bought is less than a three year hold. So not selling.
03/18/2021,stocks,I figure it’s too late to sell now.  Will just keep selling covered calls on my tech heavy account and hope it’s back even by EOY.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Nah I ain’t selling, nothing fundamentally has changed about my stocks. Ill just keep on buying when i can"
03/18/2021,stocks,I’m not fucking leaving!
03/18/2021,stocks,nah man I'm just gonna log off for a while
03/18/2021,stocks,I predict the market will go up at some point in time. May I have an analyst job now?
03/18/2021,stocks,It went above that this morning tho
03/18/2021,stocks,"This. Don't paper hand here, my retail friends. At some point in the near future, the bond yields will stabilize. And then a buying frenzy will begin. Just be patient — and look for the double bottom as a place to pick up any bargains that you missed during our previous bottom weeks ago."
03/18/2021,stocks,Quadwitching is a tossup. Everyone thinks we'll drop. Which means we won't.

03/18/2021,stocks,Hahahahahaha. 5%.
03/18/2021,stocks,"i must be new to this shit, 5% losses does not seem like much to me."
03/18/2021,stocks,5% drop and my account is 30% cash currently...

03/18/2021,stocks,It depends on if the groundhog see's his shadow
03/18/2021,stocks,People taking profits
03/18/2021,stocks,And invest in your struggling skateboard business. Mama woods!
03/18/2021,stocks,Which is still nothing compared to the longterm averages so why does everybody freak out about it?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Let's say you invest 100 bucks in Square. Their forward looking guidance says they want it so they can earn more ~5-7 years from now. Your $100 is buying you a seat to eat a piece of that future. However it's a small piece, obviously, at that shareprice. And it works out to a $101 piece of that future earnings is a 100 dollars today. The yield is less than 1%.

You won't get that dollar back as a dollar, they say they'll invest it in growth when that day comes, which is great, but their p/e is sky high and it just is what it is.

The U.S. government says it'll do the same but net a bit more -- depending on what time frame we're talking about. Right now the 10 Year gets you a bit less than 1.75%. Also it'll just give it back to you as straight cash.

It's not exactly a 1-for-1 comparison but no matter how you slice it the question becomes: why in the world would anyone buy Square? Or any of these stocks? Assuming we're not actually apes."
03/18/2021,stocks,I can offer only a rumor.   That Citadel is moving a LOT of money to try and not get caught out tomorrow for quadruple witching day.
03/18/2021,stocks,TIL people are still considering buying PLTR.
03/18/2021,stocks,I honestly think both are solid plays. I’m in a very similar position
03/18/2021,stocks,look at Boeing and Airbus
03/18/2021,stocks,Wait until they publish the re-statement  of financials.
03/18/2021,stocks,Where do you see it shooting up since yesterday? Do you have the wrong ticker? I am confused

03/18/2021,stocks,"I thought there was going to be one more pullback before a possible take off, but I didn't have in mind what happened today. 

There's no getting around it, today is absolutely alarming to me. Maybe I will look back at some of the analogs people have talked about, including myself as well. 

But today is not good at all, there was a reason I was being a little trolly about the OPEX stuff. Those ""market makers"" were likely selling puts that are now much higher than where we're at in the S&P."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I was gonna switch to webull for the perks for transferring but I’ve read a lot of issues with them , bad reviews and they are basically a Chinese clone of RH. Opened an account with TD,Fidelity now I just have to choose which one. Webulls UI is very clean though."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Tech doubled in a year. I would HIGHLY hope it cools off. TECH crashes are real and the Nasdaq is inherently the most volatile index. I own tech, I have done well in it for the last 8 years in a full on face ripping bull market, but doubling in 12 months shouldnt happen."
03/18/2021,stocks,"The most speculative type of tech stocks are the ones that are doing well, ranging from penny crypto plays to the speculative moon etf, still up quite big YTD and actually rise more than all large cap index today, I bet this have to do with biden administration's overall policy direction. Tax plus regulation for larger companies and stimulus for lower income+ small companies, this leads to rampant speculation on betting small or even penny corporations that could benefit from sudden windfall. Many penny corps who received some stimulus are also trying to justify their surging stock price from announcing crypto/EV/clean energy projects to continue the hype."
03/18/2021,stocks,170? You’ll be lucky to see 185
03/18/2021,stocks,The market as a whole is going to have to completely shit itself for that to happen. IMO DIS will see $300 before $170. I have a position.
03/18/2021,stocks,Seriously doubt it’ll go down that much again unless there’s a whole market crash
03/18/2021,stocks,Throw a bunch into $200 calls. Disney land reopens end of April.
03/18/2021,stocks,APHA was a steal at $15 last week or two.
03/18/2021,stocks,hugely priced in
03/18/2021,stocks,Takes a while for it be reflected on the quarterly report
03/18/2021,stocks,"Actually, this move does make some sense and is why I was not that bullish overall around the period the stimulus checks came out despite a recovery. 

Quad-witching time with many leaning bullish, means it's time for the market makers to destroy all the calls, the S&P has gotten close to 4k and it didn't get over 3k the first time easily I believe, and finally to screw over retail that put their stimulus money in the market.

The target for the S&P is still 4k+ land (in fact, there's a position that might be a MM here that may well be telegraphing this), but it's not coming easy, and that's been obvious for a while."

Whether or not it's a good thing depends on the company and its market sector. You have to compare it to it's industry peers to get a good idea of what the P/E ratio means.

The Dot-com crash was the result of several catalysts. Many Dot-com companies not only had high P/E ratios, but also had no income at all, or were spending millions on advertising when their income was only a few hundred thousands. They were valued based on web traffic rather than any actual fundamentals. Then there was in increase in interest rates, Japan entered a recession, Microsoft lost an anti-monopoly suit.

Is it? I think a lot of companies have realized that they can lower costs by having more folks work from home, meaning companies spend less on infrastructure costs. I don't think that this trend suddenly stops when the pandemic subsides.

> Then you have rising rates to consider. Now 1.74%.

The rates are returning to normal, healthy, pre-covid levels. 1.74% is still super low, compared to where we were just a few years ago. The market is puking up over this because it's creating short-term volatility and uncertainty. Once the rates level off, I expect the same for volatility. 

> a lot of other companies hammered by covid are now legitimate alternatives for investment.

Usually, when I'm trimming, I'm selling off some of my winners to take profit and then buy dips in other, different stocks. That also increases your diversification for a nice win-win."
03/18/2021,stocks,"> Thinking last week of March for the best buying opportunities

This has become my thought as well. Because so many folks missed that first big dip, and we do have JPow promising that keep rates and inflation in check (for what his comments are worth), I'm skeptical that we'll reach that previous low again.

I do think we'll head lower than here in the next week or so, but too many people will be more ready to buy that next big dip.

Timeline-wise, I think we're stuck in this corrective period for another week or two. Just wait until the bond yields normalize around 2% or so, and the narrative shifts towards the market being oversold in the face of a reopening economy. Then I would expect a massive meltup. We've seen signs of it take sprout already. Once the yield issue is out of the way, watch out."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Could you explain that to me?

For example I was looking to profit on a call with a $75 strike expiring next Friday. 

What would I sell to lock that in?"

I’m in UWMC purely because of wsb and I’m up 10%"
03/18/2021,stocks,I’m over 10% down for the day. What’s this 4.5%?
03/18/2021,stocks,Ow. I broke my arms!
03/18/2021,stocks,Because the media told them to
03/18/2021,stocks,"It's not about the yield, but about how fast the yield has gone up. It be different if this were gradual"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Would you buy bonds today if yields are up 6% tomorrow? You should obviously wait a day and buy them then. Fewer people buying bonds means even higher yields. Higher yields means the risk premium on stocks shrink. If we're forecasting that this premium will continue to shrink, then we forecast 6-12 month down the road, and all of a sudden certain stock classes make a lot less sense relative to bonds. So we go cash *now* and buy back in once yields flatten again."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Have you seen equity valuations for tech?

A lot of these companies valuations will be chopped off at the knees with historically average yield rates"

03/18/2021,stocks,"It's showing that on my sofi app. But when I check on robinhood, it's showing the correct data I'm assuming...hmm Maybe it was just added to sofi or something? That's kinda shitty.

03/18/2021,stocks,"Interesting point, TKAT went nuts yesterday too.. it appears trading was halted on it 1hr 15 mins ago too.  Wonder what happened there."
03/18/2021,stocks,For real. LMAO!
03/18/2021,stocks,We need to like start a giant movement where everyone put like 1/4 of their portfolio into bonds to lower the yields lmao

03/18/2021,stocks,Short term yes. Long term i very much doubt it.

03/18/2021,stocks,I would *love* to see MSFT under $230 again. I bought it heavily at that discounted price a few weeks back.
03/18/2021,stocks,The entire market needs a healthy ten percent slash and burn
03/18/2021,stocks,I’m anticipating a correction for sp at 10 percent so nasdaq would be like 20-30 percent. It’s always a bit more dramatic both in ups and downs
03/18/2021,stocks,I'll average down then.

03/18/2021,stocks,Don’t know what that means bro lol

(from hyperinflation)"
03/18/2021,stocks,I hope you're right.
03/18/2021,stocks,Oh didn’t know that. Thanks
03/18/2021,stocks,The trigger for the dot com crash was rising interest rates. That’s generally agreed. You really think that today’s bubble stocks are any different from 2000? ROKU trades at 26 times revenue (not earnings) never has had a GAAP profit. I can name dozens more. Bubble stocks everywhere.
03/18/2021,stocks,"You really don't even have to look any further than yesterday, where it was a bloodbath all morning and then turned green for the day by the afternoon."
03/18/2021,stocks,Yeah I get it ..I rode all the previous shitty weeks..I'm just sick of the market not making sense to be honest..as soon as positions went green I sold them.. I'm a heavy index fund investor that just got lucky on gamestop because I threw a random settlement check I got from my previous job into it and it happened to x22 cuz I listened to some reddit user spamming to buy 115c ..I didn't even know what that was haha. I don't think this individual stock thing is for me..too much work and time and my job and outside life just doesn't allow it.
03/18/2021,stocks,Done
03/18/2021,stocks,Exactly this. And even harder to not fall apart and liquidate every time there is a fucking road bump.
03/18/2021,stocks,That would be nice
03/18/2021,stocks,"Depends on what you're in.

I still think it's more likely than it is not that the tech indices themselves at least make it back to mid-February, even if it might take into May or later (my timeline has been mid-April), but certain stuff in the tech sector...things like Tesla for example...

It could already be curtains for all of them."
03/18/2021,stocks,Deep.
03/18/2021,stocks,He cant tell you because he doesn't  know
03/18/2021,stocks,"This is more than that though. Granted, market wide corrections is to be expected, but I think it's fair to be frustrated during one."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Nice, thank you.  I'll look into that right now."
03/18/2021,stocks,"The Dow has a lot further to run. It’s catching up to SPY. Interest rate increase are triggering rotation to banking, health care and heavy industry like CAT. That favors DIA."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yes meant no yield curve control*

That's the other think he told the reporter to fuck off when she asked haha.  I take that as he wanted to talk about it later and control the narrative and reveal the slow tapper off."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You're sure as heck wrong on that one. That fast of a move on everything at 2 PM has only 1 explanation and it's high-frequency trading.

Retail can't cause the Nasdaq to erase a near 1 percent loss in 15 freaking minutes. That was the last thing that I expected and based off the last things that I heard on TV, I don't think anybody expected this move in yields or in the Nasdaq today, unless they felt that the initial reaction by the people that can move the market was wildly incorrect (as I saw some that said that)."
03/18/2021,stocks,"RoaringKitty has entered the chat...

03/18/2021,stocks,how do we calculate it though..What's the equation?
03/18/2021,stocks,how do we look up what the highest strike was at that time...and say i did buy the highest strike..then how much would it be worth?
03/18/2021,stocks,Yea. It saved me a couple thousand in losses while at same time being able to buy back in at lower amount but at that cost.

03/18/2021,stocks,"No, all I know is what Powell said and he said ""something will be out soon"".

I haven't been expecting next week to be too strong for a while now. The things that keep the S&P in check won't be around and there's rebalancing.

It really stinks but like I said earlier today, the tech sector took a possible rally week the first week of March and heaved it into the garbage, then burned that garbage can. It's quite likely IMHO that it has 3 red weeks this month. But if they do do something with SLR, stronger seasonality starts in April.

So...13 more days."

03/18/2021,stocks,They said during their last earnings call that the semiconductor shortage limited their production and sales.  I think the market is pricing in slower growth for them in the short term.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Not invested in PLTR or ICLN, but it’s crazy what stock prices will do to people’s game plans and philosophies lol. 

Price increasing = good investment 
Price decreasing = bad investment 

I can never understand"
03/18/2021,stocks,"XLF and XLE are my two smallest ETF positions specifically because of that. XLE is 1.9% of my portfolio. 

I consider continuing to allow ICLN to hold my investments hostage to be worse for me than that. XAR and the extra cannabis stocks I bought have already negated by ICLN losses. ICLN was straight up overvalued and I made a mistake with it. I think it will continue to go down."
03/18/2021,stocks,Better to take a loss and divert the money into an investment that has a solid chance to appreciate in value vs. holding something that has gone down and will stay down. Even putting money into something that may not appreciate but will pay a consistent dividend can be a good idea.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Because the fund manager knows jack shit about clean energy, and they have PLUG as way too high of a percentage in the portfolio (10%). Until that gets corrected, it's not a good investment.

I'm not saying it won't appreciate, I'm saying it's not likely to outperform the market."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I bought 4Front early on and I’m still solid green on them. They have a strong foothold in AZ and there will be a large market there for low-cost cannabis. I do feel bad for people who bought at like 1.80 when it was high, but I think it’ll get back up there."
03/18/2021,stocks,Because for bitcoin to implode along with those other stocks would take down Skynet's chance to survive.  It would be a Pyrrhic victory.

WFH will be company dependent, some are and some aren't allowing people to continue it but it's still going to be less than what we've seen.

Where we go from here is anyone's guess, I just don't like the idea that we're automatically going up this summer because of re-opening.  A lot of the next 6-9 months of re-opening activity has already been bought up IMO."

And it being over can have nothing to do with what the yield curve. There's one guy that I've seen say that the ""fun trades"" are likely going to end at some point this year, and it seems like it likely has."

03/18/2021,stocks,Same. WHO is doing all the selling? Hedge funds? This seems like super panic reactionary trades for a simple interest rate.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Growth stocks have always existed and as far as I can tell Roku is profitable. There's definitely a bubble in the stock market right now, but it's not identical to the Dot-com bubble. Dot-com was masses of investors saying ""this company has no revenue, has never sold anything but it's a website so its definitely a good buy"". For all intents and purposes, before the bubble burst there were no losing tickers. People made insane returns buying startups that nobody had ever even heard of, the entire market was speculation driven, not just a few growth stocks"
03/18/2021,stocks,I’m in exactly the same boat. Just slap it all in funds I can’t be bothered with the stress.
03/18/2021,stocks,Well there *are* moves you can make in the market that don’t need to be monitored all day. Depends on what you’re trying to do.
03/18/2021,stocks,Good answer and an appreciation for deep fucking value - respek
03/18/2021,stocks,Thought so. I just think some of the comments here are outright dangerous for the mindset of some new investors as you see lots of these 'opinions' flail about like they're facts or top of the range financial advice. People really need to be careful.
03/18/2021,stocks,Completely agree.

03/18/2021,stocks,"That still won't make it a great investment. I see a lot of people saying that ""clean energy is a good long term investment."" But I think a lot of those people misunderstand what a good long term investment is.

A good long term investment is one that appreciates well over time and will beat market returns on most years, and will average out to above market returns. A bad long term investment is one that might beat market returns a few times a decade but will average out to below market returns. 

Clean energy still has a very long way to go before it's profitable. Makes very little sense to hold it and hope for above market returns when those returns may not happen for 5 years or more."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Hahahaha, I completely agree with that. I’m wondering if we see a more pronounced dip next week, but am seeing lots of buying in each dip we take so it’s hard to tell. When you say ‘things that are keeping the S&P in check’ what do you mean specifically though?"
03/18/2021,stocks,Avg down? When did you get in?
03/18/2021,stocks,"It's way more than that. 

PLTR - their own executives sold millions of dollars in shares several weeks ago signaling that even they thought the price was not likely to go up anytime soon. Since then, it's done nothing but go down in price. The CEO in an interview this week said PLTR was not going to perform well in the short term. People on here have this misunderstanding about what a ""long term"" investment means. A good long term investment is one that appreciates well over time, and will beat market returns on most years and average out to above market returns. A bad long term investment is one that does nothing for 5 years and then beats the market once or twice a decade.

ICLN - Having PLUG as the number 1 holding (10%) is just dumb, and shows the portfolio manager doesn't know anything about ""clean"" energy. Currently 90% of the worlds hydrogen comes from natural gas. That's not a ""clean"" energy source. Either the fund manager knows this and doesn't care, or he doesn't know. Either way... that's not good."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah, fair. ICLN is a difficult one specifically because it probably can drop further and you (rightly so) are considering the opportunity cost. In general though, this wouldn’t be smart. But I take the point about those specific stocks."
03/18/2021,stocks,The rebalance is next month for the holdings
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah that's me - I got in at 1.76. I was impatient and absolutely knew to wait until the wsb cannabis hype passed, but didn't do it and bought in.

03/18/2021,stocks,"Purely from a tech perspective companies that want to attract top software engineering talent will absolutely have to offer WFH options now that so many of the big players are offering it. The more companies that follow suit the more essential it will be. This will become the single most important “benefit” moving forward and people will accept an offer with a lower salary if it is fully remote 

I work for a company that has historically been completely against any sort of WFH policy and they’ve already announced 3 remote days per week once we return to office, and I’d be surprised if that didn’t eventually become completely voluntary"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah, it definitely is tempting. And I can't pretend that I haven't had some success with this maneuver. I was able to significantly lower *and* expand my QCOM position during this volatility. But overall, I wonder how much you actually gain versus the large risk you're taking that you might not find that optimal reentry point."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I've been in the market for more than three months, lol. Good luck to all beginners, and don't be afraid to take some money off the table once you start seeing positions push heavy into the green. Remember: Cash is strength."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm not convinced that tech gets left behind because tech still comprises so much of our future. Some of the inflated plays that benefited from the pandemic might lag (stuff like Zoom), but tech stocks that can work just as well outside of a pandemic (APPL, PYPL, MSFT, etc) will be fine.

Through good fortune, I timed the last bottom, so I'm pretty well invested at lower levels than this. What I bought was a basket of tech and value: ETSY, MSFT, FSLY, QCOM, TGT, WBA. I'd happily add to any of those if we dipped big again. I still do like NIO and CRSR, but if we're going to nosedive, I'd prefer to grab blue-chippers — foundational stocks — while they're on sale, and worry about my speculative plays later. Speaking of which, PYPL and CRM also look attractive to me here, but I already own too much of both from previously investing in those companies."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Oh! My mistake.

Yes -- I'm actually coming to the conclusion that our March low is the next support line below us. Which, I should clarify, is subjective and someone else could disagree with."

03/18/2021,stocks,So tomorrow?
03/18/2021,stocks,Yields are going up *because* investors are forecasting higher inflation.
03/18/2021,stocks,Lol ......
03/18/2021,stocks,I don't think there's any time horizon where that's true. S&P500 has a ~7% annualised return over a multi-decade period. Over the last decade it's more like 13-14%.

03/18/2021,stocks,"I have been bearish tech. I have been bullish value and bullish yields. I have been taking profits on each SPY and ES dip. Whenever the markets creep back up like yesterday, I add to my shorts and buy cheaper puts. I continue to be bearish short term.

03/18/2021,stocks,"When the market was going up and it hasn't dipped yet. Don't think you can read a one hour chart.

Oh man you post in TSLA and GME bagholders. Yeah stocks only go up."
03/18/2021,stocks,You should seriously not criticize someone's portfolio without knowing what it is.  I don't have speculative stocks.
03/18/2021,stocks,"You do realise a decent chunk of money in the market is borrowed? People and funds have margin calls, debt repayments, speculators who think they'll buy back lower, plus the level of retail investment is unprecedented, there's people who think -5% is a bloodbath and panic sell. Unless the company you bought is a scam, bankrupt or totally fucked you don't sell. Ever."
03/18/2021,stocks,Yeah that's what I'm planning to dowith half of it. Might try this out again later on
03/18/2021,stocks,Well that's what I have my roth for. I put in 30% of my salary into 401/roth. Those are in index funds or low risk etfs that are set and forget..my td ameritrade was just an account I made recently to try the market on a invidual level.. well so far that shit ain't for me haha.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Thanks. I added that to my watch list, may DCA into it."

03/18/2021,stocks,"It'd be above my paygrade to explain but gamma helps hold the S&P in check for stretches every month. That's gone, and the only reason why it's largely not doing awful right now with tech smoked is because we haven't gone through OPEX yet.

03/18/2021,stocks,"Everybody thinking I dumped all my apple stocks too just because I'm down a few percentage points lol. pltr and icln are unique situations, they could have A LOT further to go down with an extremely likely scenario where they take half a decade to go back up."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Trust me I hated doing it. I don't believe it's my philosophy in general. I'm holding all my other tech stocks because nothing fundamentally has changed with any of the specific companies I own shares with, or with the ETF's I have that are tech focused. So they'll eventually get back to the price I bought them at. So I'm not buying high and selling low in general. I just really hate ICLN and don't like the volatility of pltr, have no real faith in them, and don't have the patience for a reddit overhyped tech stock that can crash."
03/18/2021,stocks,Fidelity  does
03/18/2021,stocks,"That's not really an answer to my question.  Do you think that it can simply be turned off?   If your power is off for that long, then you have more problems than just bitcoin crashing."

03/18/2021,stocks,"If you've made your hundreds of thousands awesome, know when to walk away.

03/18/2021,stocks,"i have a feeling if i ask what you’re in, it’d be almost all meme stocks and speculative tech. but alright. in any case, i do suggest you change up your strategy, whatever it is"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Ha, fair enough. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it."
03/18/2021,stocks,I've worked for one of the largest energy companies in the world for the last 10 years. But please... Enlighten me with your vast knowledge...
03/18/2021,stocks,"It certainly can seems so, but I like to think about it from this angle: Apple doesn't create products or services. I mean it does, but more importantly, Apple creates **markets**. This is a company that literally builds markets for other sectors. Their products and services build markets. When Apple touches something, it often becomes a trend, a direction, and finally a platform. Airpods are a good example, [AirPods Are Becoming a Platform](https://www.aboveavalon.com/notes/2019/11/19/airpods-are-becoming-a-platform)"
03/18/2021,stocks,You want a great company like apple at a cheap rate because when it was cheap you convinced yourself that it wouldn't 2x from 1 trillion to 2 lol
03/18/2021,stocks,"Right, good explanation, thanks. Will look into this further."
03/18/2021,stocks,"it definitely is an answer to your question... it’s an opinion, but historic volatility along with a relatively untested currency that 99.9% of the marketplace isn’t prepared to accept... is pretty prime for crashing the moment something as serious as hyperinflation comes by. for the record, hyperinflation tends to destroy countries"
03/18/2021,stocks,"If we find a new digital currency which is more efficient (in terms of energy and transaction) then Bitcoin has no value. It will only exist in papers. Take NFT’s for example. They have value because they are in demand, that’s it."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Flat rate of 20% in U.K. Not the end of the world but yep set aside cash for that.

I’m not being stupid and doubling down- I’ve withdrawn most of my winnings/reinvested in safe companies. But keeping some money aside for “meme” stocks as they’ve treated me so well this year."
03/18/2021,stocks,No one invested in the S&P is doing it purely for the dividends. It's a dumb return metric to compare.
03/18/2021,stocks,"As the other user mentioned, this is only dividend yields. Stock returns are a combination of dividends and capital gains. They are essentially interchangeable. Ignoring one side of this doesn't make any sense in this context."
03/18/2021,stocks,"It won't, but I wish it would!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Thanks! Looks like price of entry is pretty high right now for those, but will add to a watch list if we get a good Dow dip at some point here."
03/18/2021,stocks,Hyperinflation is good for bitcoin.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Bitcoin has the most computational power behind it, this is what makes it desirable. I don't really personally care about NFTs, but I fail to see how they have any more or less inherent value than a piece of art? The mona lisa isn't worth anything, it's just a piece of cloth with old paint on it, but to people it's worth a lot of money."
03/18/2021,stocks,Bitcoin has value because it is scarce and we believe it has value.   How about FIAT?
03/18/2021,stocks,"It’s not retail investors moving, it’s the banks, foreign entities and institutions."
03/18/2021,stocks,I think you’re ignoring how conservative banks are. They will take the lowest risk option available and if they can make money off dividends with no risk they’ll take it.
03/18/2021,stocks,If it trades at 40x revenue or some crazy multiple like that it will easily fall 50% if yields keep marching higher.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah, both of those have been going up steadily. I bought in first of February."
03/18/2021,stocks,well that settles it! thanks for clarifying
03/18/2021,stocks,But other cryptos are also limited. There is not an infinite supply.
03/18/2021,stocks,Moving in to what? Bond yields go up when no one buy bonds. If institutions are buying bonds the yield would go down not up.
03/18/2021,stocks,That changes nothing about his statement. The comparison you are making is really bad. You are comparing a constant  with part of a variable and then pretending one is better them the other.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Sure, but how does that apply to stocks? Stocks go up and down. They carry risk."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Good look! I had CAT 2@$194ish but sold a little bit ago. Chalk that up with plenty of other fails, but hindsight 20/20."
03/18/2021,stocks,So?
03/18/2021,stocks,Just trying to explain what’s happening with tech and the yield curve. You’re allowed to disagree.
03/18/2021,stocks,"The banks and foreign governments don’t hold stocks AND bonds, they sell their holdings to buy the now desirable 10 year treasury."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm still learning, but I feel mistakes are just part of it. I think I've made more good moves than bad so far, and that is what I feel matters."
2021-03-18 13:30:10,stocks,"Why does the amount of issued shares matter if it's possible to trade fractional shares? So correct me if I'm wrong, but I've understood that some brokerages allow trading of fractional shares, but doesn't that make the # of shares irrelevant? I'm new to this, so it may be a dumb question, but one can only get wiser by questioning.

&#x200B;

Thanks!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Not sure I understand the question.

&#x200B;

The number of share is relevant to the Market Cap of the company. Number of share \* share value = Market Cap.

&#x200B;

Being able to buy fractions of a share doesnt effect the above."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Why would it make it irrelevant? It still, in theory, sets a total limit on the shares available to the market"
03/18/2021,stocks,"The price of a share is based on the supply and demand of shares. Less shares means less supply, which means higher valuation per share. That's why the total amount matters. 

If a company makes 100 dollars profit and has 10 shares outstanding it's 10 dollars per share. 
If the same company has 100 shares outstanding it's 1 dollar per share. 
When you buy a share you pay for it what you think it's worth. A share with 10 dollars profit per share is usually worth more than 1 dollar per share profit (intrinsic value). 

The fractional shares don't change the total amount of outstanding shares. The total matters!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Fractional shares are the only way I've ever traded, allows hobby traders like me to enjoy a bit of TSLA.

Hadn't considered the implication of owning fractions though."
03/18/2021,stocks,"If a company issues additional shares, it’s dilutive. If a company buys back shares, it’s accretive. If a large percentage of the float is shorted, or held by institutions, or exchanges hands over a given period, these all have different possible implications. If a brokerage holds shares and resells fractions of them to its account holders, this does not skew or conflate these various scenarios."
03/18/2021,stocks,"How does it not matter?  I’m baffled.  Just because I can buy 0.5 shares doesn’t suddenly mean the issued shares are infinite.  But here is the best Eli5 I can come up with:

Basically, I still want to know how much of the company I own.  Even if I own a fraction of 1 share, I want to know how much of the company that fraction is worth.  Is it 0.5/100 shares or 0.5/10m shares.  In the first option I own 0.5% of the company, in the second, I own significantly less.  I need to know the total number to calculate my shares value."
03/18/2021,stocks,Don’t confuse issued shares with authorized shares and outstanding shares!
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm taking an intro to technical analysis course, in which it's stated that number of shares is an important metric (I'm assuming it's because that usually leads to higher liquidity). But if shares can be split into fractions then the amount of shares shouldn't really matter as a metric, right?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Consider: BRKb is a fraction of BRKa. They should move in lock step, yet they *don't?*  Why?

It's easier to match buyers of BRKb, since there are more shares issued. If you want to sell 100 BRKa, you need to wait for a buyer to show up. That may not be as easy as finding 100000 shares of BRKb!  Availability creates liquidity and pricing disparities."
03/18/2021,stocks,Can you please explain the last 2? What are outstanding shares and authorized shares?
03/18/2021,stocks,"There is one major flaw in your thinking. 
Fractional shares don't trade on the open market; The only way to sell fractional shares is through a major brokerage firm, which can join them with other fractional shares until a whole share is attained."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You should take an intro to basic maths before you move into technical analysis. Share quantity X share price = marketcap, and if you think that fractionalising shares has any effect on that then you have some serious flaws in your arithmetic."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Right, I get the question now ;)

&#x200B;

Its still an issue as the broker still needs to obtain 1 share to sell you half of it. If the broker cannot obtain a full share the liquidity issue still occurs."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Brokers still move shares in lots of 100. Odd lots and fractions are harder to match up, so liquidity drops...and *the net price rises*. 

 Also note, Liquidity is good if there's a stampede for the door! Especially if you're early to leave. That fractional shares may get you stuck holding for a longer time."
03/18/2021,stocks,"It still matters because demand exists relative to percentage owned, not relative to a single share. So a stock at $17 with 100 shares is going to move a lot strongly than one at $17 with 1,000,000 shares. Because the former is 1% of the company while the letter is 0.0001% of the company. 

Basically in a fake universe where all companies are the same, the stock with the fewest shares will have the most demand."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah absolutely makes sense, great description too, thanks. I guess since I'm only trading such small volume, such small multiples, that it has never affected me meaningfully enough to worry about."
03/18/2021,stocks,Please use Google. It’s not rocket science. Investopedia will give you a good answer.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Similar point, phrased differently

03/18/2021,stocks,And your broker has an emphasis on fractions.. may not always be!   I'd say build your holdings to full shares. They're harder to ignore.

Aside: Schwab bought TD-Ameritrade, but they keep separate systems. TD has at least three interfaces on desktop alone.

- RH admitted they don’t hold the GME shares, and with a ton of people transferring their shares out, RH will have to round them up.

Those are the only definite potential catalysts off the top of my head. Also, there is always the chance they recall their shares since they’re over 100%, maybe by the new CFO? That’s purely speculative though."

03/18/2021,stocks,"I’ve seen DD on why GME is done & why they are still short and, to be honest, the latter is far more convincing with seemingly solid data to back it up.

My big question is the dip from $340 to $170. The best guess is a whale/entity selling their position, but there were so many calls that would’ve been ITM if they had kept pushing $10 more dollars to $350 EOD or even$400. Those options were what was causing the surge, so why in the hell would they sell at that point?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I think they covered. Didn't read the etf stuff, but how would an etf have impact on GME it's price. I feel this is just all hype.
That drop can be from someone who shorted shares at 340 while low volume. Creates a big drop and stop losses. So that person now made lots of money.

03/18/2021,stocks,But before the pandemic it was already down to like $10 a share
03/18/2021,stocks,"It was already down to like $10 a share the summer of 2019 though, it was below the price before the pandemic"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Any institutional transaction is enough to move it a ton right now. The bear case is that the DD is all speculative and needs to line up perfectly for the squeeze to occur again, and you have to believe that whales didn’t reposition when the stock was at $40 to make money either way. The only way this takes off again is if big money starts duking it out again."
03/18/2021,stocks,The only explanation for the dip that makes sense to me is that it was someone desperate to tank the price before it got to $350 or whatever. If you were trying to make a profit on those shares you wouldn't dump them all in an instant. Anyone got a better explanation?
03/18/2021,stocks,"The ETF shorting story actually seems pretty believable. Every ETF that contains GME saw a huge spike in short interest. By shorting the ETF and then going long on everything it contains, except GME, they have a net short position in GME.

It would only add the equivalent of maybe 1MM more shares shorted, but shorters playing shady games like this seems bullish to me."
03/18/2021,stocks,"So the idea is that is you make a package of companies worthless the underlying assets also become worthless. Think CDOs in 2008, when BBB bonds failed the whole stack up to AAA tranches (stock i guess) failed. Now we’re at GME which spiked hard, they “covered” now we’re back up to astronomical highs looking higher. I have a post pinned to my profile that explains the shorts in ETFS a bit more in detail if you’re interested!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Oh, I’m aware of that, but previous occurrences don’t define the next, especially in something as unpredictable as the stock market.  What I’m wondering is if something does happen, what activity does witching usually cause"
03/18/2021,stocks,"At this point I’ve chosen not to care about what happens to GME, that shit doesn’t run on fundamentals anymore"
03/18/2021,stocks,Yeah I’ve heard that about Jesus my whole life too. Hard to plan ahead.
03/18/2021,stocks,"We only know that it will happen, just not when. People always try but the only thing that matters is just buying what you can and holding it until the shorts have to be met.

As for the catalyst, it could be basically anything. Literally anything.just sit tight."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You don’t have to transfer them all in one go. Plan a 10 day transfer, and move 10% each day. 

Only thing to bare in mind the time taken to ‘clear’ in your new account.

With careful management, you can ensure you’ve only got 10% unavailable to trade. So if (repeat IF) value changes significantly, you still have 90% available to trade.

Not advice, just my idle musings."
03/18/2021,stocks,Can't disagree with that.
03/18/2021,stocks,Agreed.

03/18/2021,stocks,"Chopping and changing is what gets most people. I once got a piece of valuable advice from someone in my family who was an extremely successful investor. He did primarily real estate, and when I asked him why not securities and stocks he said “yea they return better than real estate, but you can’t fuck with real estate, you can’t just call up someone and sell/buy them overnight. Every transaction you sleep on for at least 20 days. The costs of selling and buying forces you to hold at least 5 years. Even more if you have a partner. That’s how all investment should be and real estate forces you to do it right” so idk maybe get into real estate if you have this constant tinkering mentality"
03/18/2021,stocks,"We about to be.
In all honesty I have no idea what I’m talking about, I see stocks go down for an extended period of time and I claim bear. There is probably a more accurate term for what our market is going through currently however."
03/18/2021,stocks,"We really shouldn't. Even if the economy isn't doing as hot as we originally thought, it's still on its way to recovery as the number of administered vaccines grows every day. 

The reason for treasury yield increases is actually because of everyone seeing the pandemic coming to an end, and exiting their positions in this asset. 

Markets could keep falling, but it's not going to be like March 2020 imo. In a rising rate environment though, a lot of the tech stocks that are way past their pre-covid highs are probably going to get hit mighty hard. 

Markets are just spooked at the moment, not knowing just how high yields will go and for how long. 

Possible the Fed will step in and increase asset purchases if it sees them going up too much despite the economy still needing relatively low interest rates to boost recovery."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yes exactly. Before the pandemic everyone (including myself admittedly) believed that theaters were dead, killed by streaming. Now that we have been forced to stay one year without theaters and with only streaming as a way to watch movies, the consensus on the fate of theaters has shifted dramatically. Personally I see theaters as a very viable business in the  near future, and also long term if they can innovate slightly their offering."
03/18/2021,stocks,Maybe they will have a good rebound as people are really ready to just do anything. When Hollywood gets back to normal and movies start flowing out again maybe they will get busy. Also maybe this meme stuff helped give them enough money to invest in their future. I also may just be really hopeful becsuse I have some only because it was safer in my eyes than gme I'm the long term. Brick and morter game stores are done I believe.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Well, it bounced back to $260. So, they could have sold their position and bought back in at $180 and trusted retail to keep spamming it."
03/18/2021,stocks,"That makes absolutely no sense. They only make money if the price of the ETF goes down, so if the underlying assets beside GME stay strong and GME, which only makes up 5-10% of their holdings, goes down a little, then their net profit is barely even worth it. This also doesn’t put any downward pressure GME itself. If anything, they’d want the price of the other holdings to go down and GME to become a bigger percentage of the value so they flood the market with shares when they rebalance over the next few weeks.

Edit: also, why is everything a bullish sign to GME holders?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Even if gme goes up, the shorts on the etf won't have to cover. Even if they do, price of etf goes up, not actually gme shares. So it's all nonsense it seems"
03/18/2021,stocks,"That would just mean they opened new shorts on the  etf, at a high entry possibly. And on GME itself it got covered?"
03/18/2021,stocks,spin the wheel for your answer. Some of this shit happens just because the moon is full.
03/18/2021,stocks,You don't know it's gonna happen...
03/18/2021,stocks,"That is very good advice, thank you."
03/18/2021,stocks,Just enough good news to keep us hanging until we are holding the bag?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Except gme is entering digital platform, thats the whole point of having Ryan Cohen on the board"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Apparently, there's another layer of complexity here - Authorized Participants (wall street big boys) are allowed to disassemble the ETF shares into the underlying securities, which is how they end up shorting only GME.

Fair point about my confirmation bias as a GME long - I'm here asking for the bear case in an effort to counteract my bias. But it seems like if someone's going to all this trouble to short GME in a way that doesn't push the ""official"" SI upwards, they must want me to sell."
03/18/2021,stocks,See my reply below - it actually does let them short GME
03/18/2021,stocks,"Think about it like this; if you’re a market maker and massive, you short a stock. Because of your vast knowledge/algo and deep pockets the stock falls in price due to your put/short sell. This drives the price down a bit at which point they can buy another out and keep this momentum over and over to keep making money (OR in this case keep digging deeper into FTD because they are starting to pull shares out of thin air)"
03/18/2021,stocks,"If you believe they covered then no.

 If you believe they didnt cover then I dont see how it cant happen, but only If everyone actually holds. If everyone holds and they're short then the squeeze happens because there's just no other choice. Right now it seems like everyone from whales and other MMs to retailers are primarily holding, so if the stock is still heavily shorted it will blow up.

But if you dont believe they're short then all this is null anyway. I personally believe they're still short because all the behavior seems to point towards that being the case despite them saying otherwise."
03/18/2021,stocks,"That’s the ultimate question. Even DFV only predicted the price going to 50. My personal theory is that as long as the apes hold their shares, it’ll make an already volatile stock have an even smaller float. I think there will be multiple small squeezes over the year as whales ride it up and down. Not as big as January , but I don’t think this is the last time."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I mean that's great, but can they compete with the platforms that already sell digital? And how csn they compete with Microsoft game pass? I mean I just don't see why anyone would buy digital from there when they can buy everything digital everywhere else already."
03/18/2021,stocks,Or they are just banking on it inevitably crashing back to earth on its own and want to avoid exposure to the volatility and costs of shorting GME directly.
03/18/2021,stocks,Yes but shorting an etf won't do shit to gme unless they short it to 0? Also buying gme shares won't squeeze shorts on an etf. I might be wrong but this is bagholders hoping
03/18/2021,stocks,I hope you are right.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Game stop already has multiple exclusive deals across different game companies which they can leverage as exclusives. Also they seem to be making their physical stores into lan centers and physical game stores like local game shops. Theres a lot of u knowns about gme with a lot of potential, and they're making public and noticable changes in the near future that reflects a goal to improve.

Also gaming just keeps getting bigger year by year so anything in that field will grow. Alternatively, movie theaters have seen reduced turnout year by year as streaming rises in popularity. AMC was already in debt and the pandemic put them super deep in the red. Their shares are already very diluted and theres a real risk of them diluting the shares even more in order to pay off their debts.

If you give me a choice in the longterm I see gme with a lot more potential than amc. It won't be easy, but it's not impossible. AMC just seems to want to return to the status quo which was already not very impressive pre covid."
03/18/2021,stocks,Can you explain in more detail? How does directly shorting GME incur more costs and volatility?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Not to sound like a dick or anything but did you even look into the numbers in my postings? If you have a lambo dealership, and you know lambo = good buy some people say lambo bad. Enough people on yelp say lambo bad, lambo value not change, but public sentiment of dealership bad = car bad. 
The same applies to ETFs, XRT for example was originally 2% GME now its ballooned to 12% (hence needs rebalancing). If there are no lambo left to buy in the world, people are going to start going to that shitty yelp reviewed dealership. That’s where we are now (hence the MINISCULE 15M volume yesterday). No one is selling GME except for big boys, and with the new DTTC T+1 rule going into effect today, I think there’s a real case to be made for astronomical gains (let’s not forget Citadel got absolutely spit roasted at the hearing yesterday)"
03/18/2021,stocks,It happened twice. Three or 4 times certainly seems plausible to me
03/18/2021,stocks,"The price can obviously swing wildly each day, so the IV on most calls and puts are pretty high right now and that can make them more expensive. The ETF options likely aren’t subject to the same phenomenon."

Before I've heard people mention the Vanguard FTSE All World but didn't realize there was two of them when looking on T212. They seem pretty similar but the prices are slightly different.

What is the difference and is one better than the other?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"VWRL pays a dividend into your account. 

VWRP automatically reinvests the dividend in itself."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I am confused, I use TD Ameritade and it just automatically reinvests my dividends no matter what company I buy into. Why does Vanguard need to sell two separate shares for dividend reinvestment?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Do you have an option selected to automatically reinvest dividends?

It’s not normal for that to happen by itself."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yes, on TD Ameritrade if you click on the account tab, than click on positions at the bottom there is a option that says dividends click that. Than you will see auto roll in DRIP you can turn it on and it just reinvests all my dividend payments."
2021-03-18 12:25:13,stocks,"Looks like a big institutional sell off today and friday. Guys, please do not get value trapped! If you check the 2000 nasdaq dot com crash chart you can see we are at the 2nd of the twin spikes right after the first big crash. Depending on the stock you can calculate and we are within a few percentage pts of the 2000 dot com crash ""twins of the apocolaypse"". I've used this chart as a road map the last 3 weeks to short Zoom, Tesla and several other tech stocks and its been spot on. 

Remember guys, institutions hold the majority of the float in a lot of stocks and today & tomorrow they want to dump it onto the poor american investor like theyve done every time.
I cant tell you what to do with your money if you wanna attempt to dip buy. But I will say, know the crash chart bottoms and dont fall into a value trap. Every stock is different, the speculative tech stocks have for the most part followed the 2000 dot com crash chart on wikipedia. Just on a much faster time frame. (close to 10x)
For reference, I believe bottom for Amazon and microsoft in 2000 were around 30% of the peak value. 
When I purchase the bottom, I will be looking for 20-36% of the peak as my buy in based on the big crashes. That to me provides the most safety against a wall street value trap.
Do not fret, there are 300% gains to be had upon the conclusion of this whole fiasco. 30% of peak will take months at the minimum I would think. Good luck and happy hunting guys!

Other than that: I think everyone is expecting some kind of crash or major pullback - but it can be still weeks/months/even years away. Tbh this might actually be more of a tax harvesting thing - we are round about 1 year from when everything went south - many bought cheap shares and might want to cash in now."

Thanks!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Your broker should.. for a huge fee
You can try reaching out to the companies IR group

Some companies like Apple & Disney quit paper shares completely.  

I've never used it but this looks fairly reputable

https://www.giveashare.com/"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Most brokers hold your shares in ""street name"" for low cost and ease of transaction. If you want to become a registered shareholder then you'll have to pay a fee for that, since that requires your broker to pay the company's transfer agent/registrar to enter your name into their database etc. It's not just the physical issue of the share certificate that costs you, but also the transfer agent and/or registrar's service. It's for the same reason that you vote through a proxy in shareholder votes, you'd need to be a registered shareholder to vote directly. If you become a registered shareholder, then clearance for your trades in that issue becomes more complex and costly since it involves dealing directly with the DTC and the company's transfer agent. See here:

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/registered-holder.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/registered-holder.asp)

Usually it's not worth becoming a registered shareholder unless you intend to make a sizeable and very long term investment in the company."
03/18/2021,stocks,Yup. Your stocks are not actually your stocks. They are held in “street name.”
03/18/2021,stocks,I’m curious - is it sentimental value or just a conversation piece to frame and hang on the wall? I kind of like that idea but not sure it’s worth the hassle or expense for me just for the heck of it.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Some companies are really missing out on an opportunity here.  Ferrari does not offer physical stock certificates.  They could offer them for a large handling fee, maybe even framed, and sell a ton of shares to millions of Ferrari fans.  It would probably stabilize the stock as well because people hanging them on a wall won't be buying and selling them on a whim."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Disney.. by chance, I have a Disney cert.. stamped *Specimen*!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Not true. Most brokers allow you to request stock certificates, albeit usually with a fee associated."
03/18/2021,stocks,"The shares legally belong to the person who purchases them. The broker holds them in street name to facilitate trades and reduce costs, but you can require to become a registered shareholder (for which you will have to pay a fee). This is a highly regulated business so it's not likely that the broker will try to cheat its clients on something like this."
03/18/2021,stocks,Some of both. It'd totally be framed on the wall.
03/18/2021,stocks,Physical shares are a great idea imo- the only ones losing on them are hedge funds lol

03/18/2021,stocks,"Hedge funds usually do well for themselves and are only accessible to accredited investors. Most retail investors are not even eligible to participate. The idea that small investors can stick it to the hedge funds is unrealistic, what happened with GME is a pretty rare event."
03/18/2021,stocks,"The broker will oblige if you request that, but you will pay a fee. Brokers are registered with the company's transfer agent and/or registrar and they will put you in contact with them if you ask. Of course this costs a fee which is charged mainly by the transfer agent (beyond a small fee charged by the broker)."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Apple won't issue one (for example).. it's up to the company. 

It's usually, but not always, available."
03/18/2021,stocks,The company may refuse to issue physical share certificates but they will register you with their transfer agent if you ask and pay the fee (which makes sense only if you are a major investor). Paper certificates are a bit quaint nowadays.
2021-03-18 11:51:32,stocks,"Has the Volks Wagen left the Station? So much good news about VW lately, and was thinking of starting a position. But seeing that VWAGY has risen 30% just yesterday, almost 50% in a week, 92% in 1m and 103% this year, I am afraid there will be a pull-back or a longterm sideway movement. But maybe over a long term horizon (2 years or more), it may still make sense to invest in them?

Though there is nothing official, some analysts that were being interviewed on Bloomberg yesterday were saying vw will be apple's partner for their ev and that deal may happen as early as summer. If that happens, then vw is gonna really take off again.

So what do you guys think?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Don’t forget the massive production capabilities of VW. Additionally (in the EV transition) they are able to sell cars (ID.4) to the masses for a “bargain” price. 

I’m also on board here (but also NIO). Take it as you want to, but I see that VW will catch up - especially in regards to the quality and Germany will substitute that heavily (tummy feeling as a source and because I live in Germany)"

03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm not a Tesla fan boy, and its price right now isn't super attractive, but if I was looking to invest in the EV/automotive market, I'd invest in Tesla. You can't deny the fact that their tech is years ahead of any competition as much as I liked to hate on it in the past. Even some SPACs are safer than investing into legacy car manufacturers (especially Ford and GM). People are day/swing trading VW. It's not a long term hold for most of them, and it shouldn't be for anyone."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Much hype with VW and their plans for battery production in the past days, but note a few things: Globally VW performs quite well, they sell lots of cars in China but they make the earnings with good old fuel powered engines. They lack EV and that's why I think they will fail on the major markets in Europe and the US, where electric might become kind of obligatory. 

I am not a automotive specialist, but I observe VW from its very heart here in Lower Saxony and have some insights into the company. What I found is, that they lack the appropriate culture to become a player in EV production. They are so proud of their old fashioned products and so rooted in our economy, they don't feel any pressure to change products and be innovate, as long as they can sell their fuel cars in Europe and China. Our government holds share in VW and they will make sure, they can sell there cars to us Germans, no matter how much CO2 they are emitting.

Also, don't trust those criminals. VW proved to be deeply corrupted and the whole Diesel manipulation thing did not have the consequences necessary to change behavior in that large company.

About the Apple car thing I am not sure if it will ever happen. If I was to decide on behalf of Apple, I would have a look for innovative guys and not that kind of slow developing VW people. Very contrary cultures in those companies, not sure how they fit together.

Anyway, as a German, I don't see EV becoming a thing here anytime soon. Even Tesla can't build the necessary infrastructure, we barely have charging stations and there are no signs that anyone will build some in the coming years."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Not before 2025 and that means 4 more years Tesla improvements

Audi's EV project Artemis will be delayed by one year to 2025. Apparently, Audi has problems in Software engineering for months now. They use VWs VW.OS 2.0 software. We can assume that vw will be delayed too. At the same time, Audi says: We must not lose sight of our core business.

Tesla is not just a car maker, they are also leader in software engineering."
03/18/2021,stocks,And because they own a stake through the federal state Niedersachsen and will benefit directly and through nice jobs for retired politicians in the company.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I am so Germany biased as well. I think the true value of VW is somewhere around $150-200 bn. which we already reached. But right now it’s really hyped up. 

There are several good reasons to invest into VW, which have been mentioned already. One of the most important things were VW and all car manufacturers lack is the distance reach of their batteries. Tesla is quite far ahead on that one. 
One of the big negatives on Tesla (besides Elons absence of proper shareholder communication) is the interior design of a Tesla. For a pricey vehicle most people would like to have Audi or Mercedes standards but they get low cost material and wide gaps. I think once the high end vehicles are competitive in terms of distance that Tesla will have a hard time. Moreover VW has a significant middle-upper class car fleet (Audi, Porsche, Bentley)

EDIT: I am holding 6 shares which I bought at $200 a piece"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Bro I made $750 today I don’t know if I should hold Volkswagen or sell, and buy the dip."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Man, Tesla market cap is still 5x that of Volkswagen, with a fraction of the sales. I understand if you think VW is expensive, but Tesla is MUCH MORE so.
Tesla cars aren’t even all that quality.

SPACs are a joke, pure speculation.

No idea if VW has left the station, I mean if the market made a lick of sense no stock would soar 50% in a day or week, save some absolutely exceptional cases, instead it’s happening ALL THE TIME and worse, even on huge market cap companies.
If the mania takes hold, it sure has room to run, see the insanity that went on with Tesla of Chinese startups. But VW may not have that shiny new halo, regardless of what it does, and the EV mania could well be past its peak."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I also think tsla will dominate the ev market for a while, but its valuation now (1k+ PE) is still crazy even after the dip this year. I will be afraid to touch it unless its below 500, but probably that won't happen.

But sooner or later, specially when the big  legacy auto makers like vw, bmw, Toyota really commit to ev, tesla is gonna give way.  Just consider what will happen the QS/VW venture on solid state batteries succeed? Or apple joining forces with vw or BMW? .."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Genuinely, what the fuck are you talking about? VW have committed to investing $66bn in EV development and are already something like $20bn into that number. The Audi e-tron, e-tron GT, Porsche Taycan, VW ID.3, Skoda Enyaq and ID.4 are all available to purchase, the e-tron especially has been out for quite a while and has sold well globally. The ID.3 is the highest selling EV in Europe currently outstripping Tesla, and they have plenty more on the way, including Audi Q4 e-tron, Seat el-Born, VW ID.5 and ID.6.  
  
The entire group is transitioning to EV. Audi have recently announced they are no longer developing internal combustion engines, Bentley will release their first EV and likely be EV only from 2026, Porsche Macan will be EV only from next generation, VW increased the working partnership between Rimac, Bugatti and Bentley. Even fucking Lamborghini are working on an EV.  
  
Their pivot towards EVs was maybe a bit later than it should have been but they are absolutely dick deep now, developing and releasing EVs faster than any other manufacturer."
03/18/2021,stocks,You have no clue what you're talking about.... Vw's future is EV. Look at their investments in nordvolt; europes biggest battery maker popping up shop everywhere around europe.

03/18/2021,stocks,"you see that's kind of my point. EV is every car manufacturers future. but VW only realising it now? they should've invested years ago already if they understood whats going on. they are reacting now, instead of acting years ago"

03/18/2021,stocks,Can you direct me to one of your posts that turned up positive?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Go back and try to find a single big winner of the past 20 years, using a PE ratio or any other standard metrics. Stock market is constantly evolving. There are many reasons to buy a stock, but if your best argument is 'it has a low PE' - you don't understand how the stock market works."
03/18/2021,stocks,"> EV is every car manufacturers future. but VW only realising it now? they should've invested years ago already if they understood whats going on. they are reacting now, instead of acting years ago

If you think VW is behind the curve, wait until you look at other manufacturers; [GM wants to go all EV by another 10 years](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/gm-go-all-electric-2035-phase-out-gas-diesel-engines-n1256055), and I suspect many companies are closer to that timeline than VWAG's five years.

VWAG sells 9+ million vehicles in the world every year and fight with Toyota for the top spot.  The fact that they are willing to go all EV in under five years tells me that they are already designing that next generation of vehicle *right now*.  And at the volumes they do, that means they've also locked up a *huge* supply and resource chain when it comes to battery components, else they wouldn't have announced their surprisingly aggressive schedule.

> I am not a automotive specialist

This is about the only thing you got right.  I'd suggest steering clear of it and injecting your ignorant opinion on the sector."

A good starting place is ETFs. They are safe (for the most part) long term plays that usually pay somewhat of a dividend. 

Research these, pick a few different ones and put some money in.  

Then once you actually feel confident in your analysis and understanding of specific companies, put money towards them.  

Making a quick buck is possible, but longevity is tried and true, and usually less stressful. N"

03/18/2021,stocks,"In my opinion you did the right thing by selling.   Even if the stock goes to $1000 next week you still did the right thing by selling when you did.   That is because you jumped in with fear and you jumped out with fear.   I have done the same thing and will continue to do it because I don't always learn my lesson.   

Fear of missing out causes me to make bad decisions, and I think it does for most people.   Because it was an impulse and you had no confidence in your position you run the risk of selling on a dip because of fear.   

This is not advice, but it is what I have learned about myself while being in a similar situation as you.   If I am going to buy a stock I need to know why I want to buy.   If I buy because I saw other people say it was a good thing I don't have much to rely on when the stock goes down in price and I start to feel uncertain.   If I saw other people say a stock was good, and I did my own research, then I can target a price I'm comfortable with and I can rely on my research to keep me confident when the price goes down.   If I'm confident I don't feel like I need to sell. 

Once I have my research I don't sell at a loss unless I find information that makes me feel like my research was wrong, or there is now new information that suggests something else is more likely to happen. 

I might also sell at a profit if a stock reaches my price target and I think it is over valued.  There are other stocks that I don't set a price for because I have no idea what it could turn into within the next 5 years,  so I buy to hold long term.  

I am holding onto games*op myself, but I am only doing so with an amount that I am comfortable with if it goes to $0.  That stock is too crazy and volatile to hold onto without being sure of why you're holding it."

You can consider them a **technology** stock with high growth (i.e  DIS+,  HULU), **entertainment** **and** **news** stock (i.e ESPN, Marvel, Star Wars, Disney being the obvious), or even a **reopening** play (i.e their amusement parks, cruiselines, shopping districts).

Their latest earnings report was excellent, but was overshadowed by the nasty drop in tech stocks the last month. Even then, DIS hardly dropped and is reclaiming the 200$ price point.

UBS has a price target of 200$ with the average price targets totaling to 205 according to FinViz.

Catalyst --> DIS to reopen parks in California by April 30. This is huge. The company is only operating from half strength right now in it's online presence of DISNEY+ and other foreign theme parks. I'm from Orange County where the parks are located and there is a strong community of people who will rush to go to the park. Competitor amusement parks such as Knott's berry farm in the area already started hiring thousands of employees in preparation for reopening and Disney will do the same.

Meanwhile DIS has a strong prospect for its streaming purposes. Total subscribers across Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ were over 140 million in January. Management has forecasted it doubling to 300M+ by 2024. For reference, Netflix has around 200million right now in the 4th quarter of 2020. Prior to DISNEY+, the company has not had a direct connection to its consumers besides the parks, but now it has ""hundreds of millions of consumers worldwide being fed a constant stream of content throughout the year.""

I believe Disney will retest the 200 position and have more to grow from there depending if market conditions have calmed. This is easily a large growth stock going into 2021.

My current positions:  DIS 4/16 200C's"
03/18/2021,stocks,So you're saying you'll see growth from 195 to 210 which is 7% in the distant future? even VTI will get you there faster.
03/18/2021,stocks,Sitting with 35 @ 110. Let's keep it moving.
03/18/2021,stocks,"The only problem I have with Disney is that they are behind the copyright extensions every time.

Mickey Mouse (Steamboat Willie) will have copyright for eternity and is basically the symbol for the copyright extension. That's good for the company, but bad for the general public.

Every time I think about Disney I think that 'art' has now 120+ years copyright and it will extended to even more soon anyway.

And I can't bring myself to invest into such a company. (same reson I will also never touch Nestle or Monsanto/Bayer)"
03/18/2021,stocks,DIS to 210$ in THE DISTANT FUTURE? That's barely growth my man
03/18/2021,stocks,"Got in years ago at $39, lets keep it going! lol."
03/18/2021,stocks,I'd also add that Disney/ESPN recently acquired the rights to half of the NHL's new tv deal for the next 7 years for 2.8B. The deal kicks off next season. https://www.thescore.com/nhl/news/2130188
03/18/2021,stocks,"So what you're saying - or betting on - is that even with the current P/E TTM being negative due to writeoffs / closures of operations and less revenue in FY 2020 and a pretty hefty fwd P/E of > 100 (at the moment of thiw writing) $DIS is a fine bet? 

And there's no, say, ""Disney+ Mania"" at all involved in that valuation?

Gotcha."
03/18/2021,stocks,I was thinking if they start pumping out movie quality series this might have some real growth potential. Was also worried it might move to slow.

03/18/2021,stocks,"I’d like to start by pointing out that Disney historically trades sideways with a better then average dividend. Obviously the pandemic has changed that and there’s no realinfo on future of the dividend but I would assume that it will be back by 2023.

Stocks fine where it’s at. They generate a ton of cash when fully operational which will allow them to fix there balance sheet nicely. there canceled dividend have also made losses less extreme.
 
They are going to win the streaming wars off of there massive amounts Of ip that allows them to turnout out more content at lower up front costs and less risk then Netflix. 

I won’t be buying more at this time but watching where park capacity limits at Disney Orlando stand and what type of numbers black widow puts up in the us and more importantly China will go along way to letting us know Disney’s future outlook."
03/18/2021,stocks,Nahhh they just added Starz too which has way more adult targetted content so that will bring more growth too imo.
03/18/2021,stocks,Nestle on the other hand is comic book supervillain evil
03/18/2021,stocks,"OK, fair points on the park openings. I'm with you though on it more being a ""sideways trade"" at best and at current levels.

Streaming Wars I think there's a lot of hope on all sides here... NF has no winning stake anymore for sure, the D+ Catalog gives them a huge ""Family viewers"" edge, agreed.

Still... I'd put its fair value at a $180-$195, including D+ revenue upvaluation since pre-Covid lockdowns. That's giving it a lot of boost already if you look at forward P/E.

Just can't see the $200 basis for it currently.

Given current market situation it's likely to break out above.

Question is just: will it stay up there?"

03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm going to give you the index fund answer:

Generally the safest way to invest long-term is to use index funds.   Normally I'd suggest a 3 fund portfolio consisting of VTI (US stocks), VXUS (International Stocks), and BND (US Bonds).

But since these ETF's hold pretty much every company in the US and Internationally, you do find that they contain companies that one might not want to invest in.   With this in mind, Vanguard (who provides the above funds) and others have produced ""ESG"" (Environmental, Social, Governance) equivalents of these funds.

Here's vanguards page: [https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/esg/](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/esg/)

The ESG equivalents of the three funds I mentioned above are ESGV, VSGX, and VCEB.   These funds exclude several categories of companies such as those who are poor stewards of the environment, or who have proven to be unethical companies, or who sell products that are controversial from an ethics viewpoint.

I'm familiar with the vanguard funds, but searching for 'ESG funds' will give you other alternatives as well."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Depends on how strict you are with your very own standards on what is ""green"" or ""ecological friendly"". There are plenty ETFs branded sustainable, ESG, green or what so ever. You will need to have a closer look yourself what it means for each of the products. 

I'll give an example: You could invest in electric vehicles, doesn't matter of it is something like Tesla, or battery production, or what ever component supplier. EV beats fuel in terms of CO2 emission. BUT battery production and car production is super resource hungry and many of the crude resources are extracted in questionable ways. A, electric powered car is still build of steel, which for sure was produced using coal, because there is no ""green"" steel yet. TESLA is clearing a huge forest in Germany to build its factory. Thinking this example through: Trains beat cars when it comes to CO2 emission. But again, trains are made of steel. 

Turns out there might not be any kind of ""green"" investment, if you're too strict. Just make sure, you focus on your very own priorities. If you like forests, don't invest in paper. If you like human rights, don't invest in China. Your are convinced of solar energy? Invest in solar energy. You are a train nerd? Invest in trains."

2021-03-18 10:10:26,stocks,Margin vs cash Can anyone explain what the difference between those 2 are? Been seeing talk on making sure to have a cash account than a margin account so your shares aren’t lend out. And how do you check if your shares are margin or cash on robinhood?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Buying on margin is dangerous if you have no clue what you are doing. If you stick to cash, your losses are limited to what your initial investment is. Investing on margin means you could be on the hook more than your investment & if you don’t meet the minimum margin call of the broker/dealer, they can liquidate your position(s) to satisfy the call and that can be any stock of their choosing."
03/18/2021,stocks,"If you can’t figure this simple question out, maybe you shouldn’t be buying stonks...??"
03/18/2021,stocks,using margin is like a loan I though? cash is your cash. kinda straight forward unless I'm wrong.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Cash is your OWN money. Money is the bank’s money which you can borrow to buy, but you’ll have to pay interests in it."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Margin = Cash loan from your brokerage using your stocks as collateral at x.x% APR interest.

Cash = Just that. Your own hard earned cash."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I’m sure yours is cash, to use margin on robinhood, you have to go to settings and turn on margin. I’m pretty sure you haven’t. Did you pay for robinhood gold?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Always use cash, Margins are related to loans and buying things with money you don't have, could end up in the hole, esp when starting out."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Let me give it a try, if I am wrong, someone please correct me.

When you have a cash account, you are limited by your own cash. If you have 5000$ you can buy 5000$ of stocks. The broker cannot and will not lend you money. 

When you have a margin account, you no longer have only your cash, but the cash of your broker too, and that is known as buying power. 

With 5000$ and no other securities on your portofolio you'd have around 20000$ buying power.(at least on IBKR)

You can use those 20k to buy shares or other securities, BUT only if your broker agrees(and this is the important part - the Broker must be willing to lend you money on THAT security(which is known as a marginable security)). And even if he agrees, he may put a different leverage percent based on the type of security(KO is way more stable than GME for example)

There are 3 important metric that you also need to consider:

1) Initial Margin - the amount I need to put down to OPEN a trade(how much money I block)
2) Maintenance Margin - the minimum required to maintain the position open
3) Net Liquidation Value - the total portofolio value as of now (that is, if you close all trades RIGHT NOW, that much cash you will have on your account)

So, let's give a practical example.

A Fresh margin account with 5000$ cash will have those stats:
1) Current Initial Margin: 0
2) Maintenance Margin:0
3) Net Liquidation Value: 5000$
4) Buying Power: 20000$
5) Current Cash: 5000$

I open a trade on KO, by buying 200 shares at 50$/share. 200*50$ = 10000$ 

My stats after this trade are:
1) Current initial Margin: 0 + an amount X(I need to open IBKR to know this)
2) Maintenance Margin: 0 + an amount Y(Need IBKR too)
3) Net Liquidation Value: 5000
4) Buying power: 10000
5) Current Cash: -5000$ (you had to borrow 5000 from IBKR to finish the transaction, so now you OWE them 5000$)

Why Initial and Maintenance Margin matter? 

When your NLV gets below CIM, you cannot open new trades, you cannot even roll over options, even for a credit if it is too much below.

When your NLV gets close to or below MM, you will get Margin Called and will have to deposit additional funds. If you cannot meet the requirements, oh well, you are forcibly liquidated 😭."
03/18/2021,stocks,Cc is margin and cash is your actual dollars you can spend in the market. Let’s say you bought stocks on margin and it went down. Your stocks go with it until you pay the lender but if you are in the negatives have no money. GL

03/18/2021,stocks,"I used robinhood to buy around 900 dollars worth of gme shares couple weeks ago, it ended up being deducted on my bank account. Is this a margin or a cash?"

03/18/2021,stocks,"so I used robinhood to buy around 2 weeks ago, I bought 900 worth of gme using the instant deposit from robinhood but it ended up deducting from my bank account, does this mean my shares now are margin or cash?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"so I bought around 900 dollars worth of gme on robinhood 2 weeks ago using the instant deposit, is my shares margin or cash?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"If cash was deducted from the account (assuming no cash is available in the brokerage account to pull from) this should reflect a cash transaction. Prior to your first margin transaction, you must acknowledge & sign a loan agreement. Anyone who borrows on margin, must sign and return it to the broker/dealer, signifying you understand the risks involved in margin. Margin operates in a loan fashion where you borrow the money from the broker/dealer and will pay the principal back plus interest. You could find yourselves in a tough spot when your value drops and you don’t have enough cash + securities to cover the margin call."
03/18/2021,stocks,"It depends if your fund was settled. If it’s not settled and you buy, then they use margin to buy it. If it’s settled, then it’s your money."

03/18/2021,stocks,"I used robinhood to buy it around 2 weeks ago, having trouble seeing if it is a margin or a cash account"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Not technically. It could mean that if it wasn’t settled on time, then they use margins to buy, then when your fund settled, then you’ll have your initial deposit to buy. You should call them. Also do you know if your account was created using margin? If no then yku don’t have to worry."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I don’t have RB, but is there a balance tap? Then go to margin"

03/18/2021,stocks,Yeah I believe robinhood is a margin account when first created. I’m on the process of transferring to fidelity. Do you know if I can turn my margin shares to cash on fidelity?

U/Breezytrigga1

Investing in Palantir now could be life changing  money in 3 years (I am holding 10) . Here is my take and why 80% of my portfolio is in this: 

1) Exposure to Military and Defence sector: Government contracting had early extension- Government money was PLTR’s main source of income for years. Biden was part of OBAMA party and he was high on war and tech. History will repeat itself and they will always be number 1 in government support. “CEO mentioned importance of this himself goes both ways” 

2) Monopoly &amp; Patents/ Ai: 
The Technology they use is so complex IBM could not compete for years and later became a client. No one is able to offer their services similar. There is 0 competition and if anyone wants to compete with their data science it will take a long time to complete. 

3) NEW Contracts/Clients(Commercial): 
They had massive contract signings as they move into Commercial sector which they have never done. Helping big names and look into how many country’s they are in. Mostly US. That is changing fast with new contracts in Japan, and UK. Also, this is the 1st time they had a Sales team to get new clients and introduce what they can bring to the table. Their new contracts were not shown in Q1 report and reason the stock fell+ lock up period over. Q2 and Q3 will reflect all the new money. 

4) FED statement “Powell” Today: 
Powell said very specifically interest rates are not going up. For Growth companies and Giants this is the time to scale and take advantage with good leadership. 
He also said “Late cycle behaviour says companies absorb higher labour cost in their margin” what does this mean? 
Basically saying companies (Ex: Amazon) will take the hit on margin for employment on their net profits- without lowering wages to stay more competitive because there is lots of competition. 
This tells me that big business is going to eat up the small guys because they’ll have a hard time growing with smaller margins because they don’t pump the same volume. 
Which Company Benefits from everything? 
Palantir: not only is it a monopoly and the biggest fish in its pond. 
It is the best thing to help the big fish in every other sector have the edge it needs to dominate.  The small fish can’t access it because they can’t afford it. 
Imagine trying to run a business against your competitors without using Google in any way shape or form. This is the best comparison on a larger corporate ladder to show how impactful it is as a resource.

Hope this helped and you buy and hold.

How do you arrive at your valuation, given we have little to no data, outlook on contract revenue yields mid-term. 

What we have is a lot of FOMO, everyone thinking something slightly different and applying their own interpretation from a ""[live"" demo](https://vimeo.com/488141017) and the appearance of [Alex Karp on CNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcUnqKFU9XA) and some other investing formats or the other interview on the [value of the stock and Wallstreet's influence](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/palantir-ceo-alex-karp-on-wall-streets-destructive-short-term-focus.html).

Is Palantir themselves being clear on the use of ""Foundry"" for Joe Everyman and Jean Everywoman for their software suite? Cutting through lots of fluff in the live demo, sure, we can see directly applicable supply chain uses for monitoring demand/supply logistics ""in real time"".

03/18/2021,stocks,IMO- best decision you will make this year for what it is trading at now. When it gets to $50’s maybe upside not as high. I have $85 price target this year.
03/18/2021,stocks,It’s not pumping you salty clown lol
03/18/2021,stocks,"Do you want me to break down math for you? I’m going to assume that’s a rhetorical question to illustrate your point of view and where you stand. 
I 100% respect your bearish outlook because you make some points. But when it comes to investing you can’t have 1 foot in both doors. 

They have 2 things I like to see: Proof of concept, and Ability to scale. They are going to have high returns because it is growing extremely fast. (1st time with a sales team) 
And 1st time in retail. 

I do not watch CNBC if you have read any books on history of investing you’d know these same people were bought to say what they tell them to. Also, I’m not in GME. 

I didn’t say mid- term it’s taking off, I said mid-term will reflect the new money shown on record for Q2, Q3. Unless it takes longer than 3 months and 6 months to start making money after signing a contract. Although I will say this. 
My price target this year alone is $85 Bull case."

03/18/2021,stocks,"When you say ""break down math"" I assume it's also rhetorical?

Because I only have their first financial year earnings with some interesting facts included, like especially the important growth prospects:

Growth came from 85% governmental contracts vs. 4% commercial yoy. This gives me pause in terms of future monetization and makes me think how quickly they can scale to grow revenues not only relying on their seemingly all-powerful ""Gotham"" offerings that are mildly interesting at best to the public eye. And they will not ""grow"" the business at scale since it's strictly limited (and secret).

I deduct from what info we have Palantir *could* build something really big based on what they seem to have developed. Also: Why's Gotham named after that run-down, dystopian city Batman hails from?

Maybe it's just me and they just have a DC fan sitting in their ranks that didn't give that one a 2nd thought. Engineers are ususally not great in branding.

Foundry is much more aptly positioned even though, again, the fluff in that live demo was pretty much to cut through to get to the few bits of info that actually make me believe they might have somthing to sell to ""imaginary company A with five factories and accordingly huge supply chains and consumer complexities"".

I do believe they can potentially build something to *actually* sell on scale in case of ""Foundry"". I'll stay in Batman's Gotham, personally.

Bear Case for sure here on mid-term sideways (2021-2022).

I'd be more inclined to follow your $85 target long-term, 2025+."

When you say YOY that’s my point exactly. 4% commercial was without trying. They can get by and thrive just on government work alone. 
Have you seen their new contract signings with companies this year alone? 
You sound more biased in your opinion than business point of view. Our job is to be emotionless. 
I really don’t think you understand their technology and what it is they do exactly, it’s not a secret there are live demos. 
You should look up the super computer “Watson” IBM created and spent billions on for years only to end up a customer to Palantir and their technology. I’m sure this will highlight some concerns you have on how relevant, real, and powerful their technology is. 
That partnership with IBM which happened only recently - Alex said himself “partnership with IBM has added more Sales people than they have EMPLOYEES- IN THE ENTIRE COMPANY” their sales force is going to push their software between 180 countries. 
After you look into that look at the usage in Palantir between countries. It’s USA by far not close and very few. 
This is just the start, still early."

For some reason, the roads started to bend. I’m not sure if I recall which movie but maybe either Inception or one of the Avengers movies with Dr. Strange I suppose where the roads start to bend at a sharp 90 degrees. Really weird. People were abandoning the town because some Godzilla creature was attacking. Then for some reason, I got a notification saying I now have $900k from my $GME shares. I was actually tearing up excitedly in the dream, like I actually felt that there was no way it was happening. Then, the truck ran out of gas.

2021-03-18 08:19:26,stocks,"Sun Country (SCNY) Ladies and gentlemen be careful out there. 

SCNY was up 50 percent, they are a company that has no real moat. Complete junk stock. They IPOed to pay off the loans from the government.

They do have a new revenue stream of doing a side hustle for AMZN but AMZN is a whipsaw corporation. They use ATI Jet, Atlas/Southern. Whipsaw is lingo for making sure each of their contractors remain competitive, meaning don’t expect any solid revenue growth from SCNY.

Sun Country has no real growth, yes they can grow on the cargo side but nothing that sustains a 50 percent markup on their IPO today.

Last thing I need is for someone to say short it... I can’t, I don’t have the capital to sustain the venture and options will not be available until next week. The market will stay stay irrational longer then I could stay solvent anyways.

Frontier Airlines will also IPO soon, again do not buy that stock at IPO levels, it’s just doing the .com bubble crap. 

However Frontier actually has a lot of room to grow with a good amount of plane orders. They are and were growing at a rapid pace pre-Covid. They have 100+ airplane orders and were hiring a fair amount of pilots. Recently they began hiring again.

TLTR: this is very reminiscent of the dot com bubble. Only thing different is none of these IPOs need a .com.

The new bubble is IPO. Invest smartly don’t FOMO, and beware of junk stocks like SCNY"

2021-03-18 07:47:08,stocks,"Why you shouldn’t use Robinhood I’ve seen a ton of posts from newer investors on what brokerages to use, and I want to be clear on why you shouldn’t use RH:

Who is their customer and what is their product?

RH would say the customer is you, the retail investor... but don’t customers give money for services?  Oh, right, they make money from order flow... that means their real customer is Citadel.

What does that make retail investors?  The product.  Just like FB and others, you are essentially the product that is being pawned around, except in this case, you have your own dollars at stake.

Is this necessarily bad?  Depends.  But if you are not their customer, you are likely not getting the attention you deserve as an investor.  The sleek look and ease to use is just to make the product more lucrative for their actual clients.

Also, it’s a tech company, not a financial services company.  Not inherently a bad thing, but a company who’s core competency is software development, and not equities trading, I’d think twice.

IRA?  Sorry.  I haven’t looked into why specifically, but it likely doesn’t generate the same money as a brokerage account.  If you were actually RH’s customer, why wouldn’t they offer you one of the best and most trusted retirement vehicles in this country?

Customer Service - never used it, but again, it’s a tech company... when have you ever got on the phone with google?

Leadership - the congressional hearings were pathetic... what is core to leadership?  Seeking responsibility for your actions.  This ceo needs to hire someone else to be the point man, he isn’t ready for the big leagues.

Many more points, but I’m getting angry just typing this.  Let’s keep brewing the hate."

There is plenty not to like about RH, but if you use the above logic, you will eliminate 90% of brokerages out there.

By your reasoning we basically should not use anybody but a broker who still charges $10 per trade, otherwise you're just the product, the cow for slaughter.

Also offering IRAs would probably subject them to many new regulations and oversight, it's an incredibly regulated industry and comes with multiple levels of compliance. My guess is that they will do this someday, but they are newer on the block.

Use whatever broker you want but this whole ""RH is the enemy"" and thinking that any other broker is not sharing all the same bedfellows as RH is pretty foolish."

Them selling my data for commission free trading, cheaper margin totally fine by me personally I was already aware of it but seems to be new information to some. I just find it funny ppl seem to point out when Robinhood stops trading or goes down but fails to mention when other larger brokerages do the same thing or push Webull a Chinese company.

DFV made bank!, and a few more who either bought the shares in bundles when they were $2 per pop or folks with deeper pockets than most of us here right now who could afford to make substantial plays.
  The rest were mostly young kids throwing away their  little savings and college tuition according to some of the posts on WSB based on instructions they got from fucking memes. It was fun while it lasted and I'm glad for those who got the lambos but the rest are still over there trying to catch a train on foot that left the station 5 minutes ago.

03/18/2021,stocks,"Just like anything else you use. Robinhood is a business, they make money off their users. If you use any business and don't realize this you are living under a rock.

It's free, unless you lose money, it's easy, it's convenient. 

I put $100 in it and it's $400 now in a year. Not great but not bad. I have a hell of a lot more money in brokerages, IRAs that a professional manages. But Robinhood is fun and has made me money, what's wrong with that?"

03/18/2021,stocks,Has anyone transferred over their stocks into a different broker? Mine is Fidelity.
03/18/2021,stocks,Most discount brokerages do PFOF. Up until recently IBKR was the only major one not to. There  are a ton of reasons not to use RH but they’re not the only ones selling your info
03/18/2021,stocks,"To think that those new posts are coming from new users and NOT robinhood themselves is preposterous. Ever since WSB was posted on the news, I've been very cynical of it's purity at this point. The stock world was shocked and rocked, then a week and a half later they were talking as if nothing happened. Reason being, they joined in on the game. They've realized, if they already didn't know, the power of reddit. What's to say they don't have bots filtering the subs or even bots creating on the sub? What's to say they didn't dedicate a few to advertising strictly on Reddit?"

03/18/2021,stocks,I like Ameritrade. I can get a human on the phone most of the time.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I worked for big tech. The most accurate statement I have heard is “if something is free, you are the product”"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Wait, wait.  I've never actually used RH so I didn't know this, but they don't let you open an IRA???  What's the point then?  If you're not maxing out your IRA every year then I don't know if you should even be messing with a taxable account."
03/18/2021,stocks,I use Fidelity but I just wish they had a better user friendly UI. RH interface makes everything easy to navigate and it’s pretty to look at. I can see why some people still stay with the
03/18/2021,stocks,I use E*TRADE and there’s no fees there either.
03/18/2021,stocks,I’m in the middle of a transfer from RH to Fidelity. I’m new to stocks (about a year of investing) and I’m finding that Fidelity’s UI on the app is hard to follow... RH was very easy to look at and read the real time charts and I like how they update every second(Fidelity is every minute?). Does anyone have tips on how to make Fidelity seem more user friendly to the newbies?
03/18/2021,stocks,I am more than willing to move everything off of Robinhood.  Question - is there a way to transfer everything to another broker?  I'm a baby trader (probably $1000 total value) mostly GME but I also bought low and so I don't want to sell it.  How can I leave Robinhood and keep everything as is for as little $ as possible?
03/18/2021,stocks,Fidelity is easily the best
03/18/2021,stocks,"You forgot one thing: how gamified Robinhood has made investing with their app. Some people might think that it is no big deal and that it doesn’t affect them but it does in a deep subconscious level. I noticed it immediately when I split my investments between two accounts: fidelity and Robinhood. I just have this tendency and desire to engage in more risky trades and to just trade overall with Robinhood.

The computer engineers and software developers who design these apps have become masterminds of human psychology and marketing. Scientists have spent years researching the reward system of the brain and how to manipulate it for their own gain. That confetti from those “scratch off” stocks you get in the beginning is exactly like gambling and people who are predisposed to gambling addictions will fall prey to their system. I don’t think a lot of people are aware of the forces being implemented into modern day technology and apps. Right now the Massachusetts securities division is investigating Robinhood for encouraging rapid trading instead of a buy and hold approach through its app design."
03/18/2021,stocks,Not a comment about rh but rather Google. Called up their customer service once and tbh it was pretty decent.
03/18/2021,stocks,Does this apply to WeBull as well? A software company not a financial company?
03/18/2021,stocks,Then what else do you suggest we use? Fidelity? I've learned a lot about investing being a newbie on Robinhood even if I don't have a lot of money. It's not a bad app to learn the ropes. Every company only cares about themselves... Nothing new. I like how all of these posts don't even explain an alternative... Great job bro
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm not disagreeing with you, I just don't understand your point about ""you"" being the product. I know what you mean by that, but what's the difference between say RH and Schwab at that point? They both exist to execute orders on your behalf, no? I'm sure their rates are different, and surely Schwab has better customer service; but it's hard to imagine not viewing yourself as a product for any company these days, let alone investing, so it's tough for me to use that as the main reason not to use RH. 

For context Ive had RH downloaded for months. I haven't used it yet, but I've actually been debating this topic as Im in the process of finding the right platform."
03/18/2021,stocks,"For boring long term investors or boggleheads who mostly buy and rarely sell Robinhood is not bad at all. It has a slick interface that is easy to use and simplifies investing. Also the debit card can come in handy for emergency purchases if bank account ever gets low.

For investors who are more active or day traders (gamblers) who are more time sensitive, then Robinhood is not a good fit at all!! I would say the majority of retail ""investors"" fall under this category. Their time horizon trends to be pretty short. If that is you Robinhood will screw you over with trade halts, by giving you spreads on short term trades, has no good tools for analysis, and a shit options platform.

Tldr; Don't day trade on RH, long-term bogglehead investing is a good fit for RH."
03/18/2021,stocks,">RH would say the customer is you, the retail investor... but don’t customers give money for services? Oh, right, they make money from order flow... that means their real customer is Citadel.

*All major brokers have pay for order-flow and have for decades now.*

This means that before Robinhood you were paying for trades *and* being sold at Fidelity, TD, etc. There is no free lunch but there certainly are people more than willing to take two and you're in an environment that Robinhood created trying to slam Robinhood for making investing accessible to you.

That's the irony. I am not saying Robinhood is great but I certainly am not daft enough to think that I was better off in the previous era. I wasn't. No one was. The ability for the ""little guy"" who actually had only pennies to pile in and do crazy things was limited. Now, he can too, be a fake tech mogul who pretends to understand the industry.

>IRA? Sorry. **I haven’t looked into why specifically, but** it likely doesn’t generate the same money as a brokerage account.

It has nothing to do with generating money because IRAs held by fiduciaries are actually great sources of interest and fees because IRAs *aren't free.* You can't offer free investing with a wrapped product (like an IRA) because the fees will be built into the product. You don't know anything. That's the problem here; you're admitting you know absolutely nothing but trying to write a scalding criticism and getting incredible attention while being wholly ignorant.

This is what's wrong with the community at the moment; RH is a scapegoat for your frustration at your ignorance.

>Also, it’s a tech company, not a financial services company. Not inherently a bad thing, but a company who’s core competency is software development, and not equities trading, I’d think twice.

The only ""financial services companies"" are dinosaurs that ""boomers"" use. TastyTrade, Webull, hell even Acorns (wut?) are not  Financial Services sector companies. Whether you're talking SoFi or M1 or any number of brokers in the modern space most of them don't meet this criteria at all. In fact the greater majority of them run through partnerships and banks that have zero stake in the Clearing Houses used.

This is schizophrenic.

>Leadership - the congressional hearings were pathetic... what is core to leadership? Seeking responsibility for your actions. This ceo needs to hire someone else to be the point man, he isn’t ready for the big leagues.

It's a tech company made for little dudes like you to go on rants on the internet after trading irresponsibly in ways no one can rationally fathom. RH is in hot water because they *allowed people to trade irresponsibly* not because they are a crappy company. They are literal outcome of ""It's my money; I do what I want with it!"" The joke and the murder of reason in one breath really; you actually *need* protection from yourself and these brokers, these old hats or their modern spinoffs, have all been doing that behind the scenes. RH, being not really something well built or understood by the creators, met with a clear and concise guillotine of activity for basically doing what everyone wished they could do but realized they really didn't want.

There's always that one lucky person in the whole crowd who's going to say something that doesn't make any sense but everyone will acknowledge and appreciate his bu!!$hit! Congrats buddy! You're that lucky person. Why can't I ever be this lucky?

> Just like FB and others, you are essentially the product that is being pawned around, except in this case, you have your own dollars at stake. 

What kind of fresh BS is this? Think about it. How does FB treat you like a product? Think... by getting your personal info and selling that to the advertisers. Why is that bad? It's bad because the advertisers can use it to break a demography.

Now let's come to the shitty example that you gave. RH. How the fuckk are we the product? You put your money in.... and that's it. You're done! 

> But if you are not their customer, you are likely not getting the attention you deserve as an investor. The sleek look and ease to use is just to make the product more lucrative for their actual clients. 

Note carefully how you contradict yourself in your own sentences! And they're not even far apart. Consequitive sentences.

""you are likely not getting"" - doesn't give me shit. Anything can be likely. It's likely that your bank might get hacked and close down. You see how stupid ""likely"" is by itself? You have to give something more concrete than that. You're just unnecessarily trying to be paranoid.

And then in the next sentence you praise them ""sleek look"" and ""ease to use"". So they do provide you some value. And not like they're gonna eat up your money. They're going to return it back, right? Think about it. So far you've not brought up anything that they're doing wrong.

> but a company who’s core competency is software development, and not equities trading, I’d think twice. 

More paranoia without saying anything concrete. How about I wouldn't trust the advice of someone on reddit because their core competency is reddit more than stock trading? 

> IRA? Sorry. I haven’t looked into why specifically, but it likely doesn’t generate the same money as a brokerage account.  

What are you talking about? A brokerage account has you paying for the trades you make. You don't ""generate"" money like bitcoins or plants. You trade money for stock or vice versa. A stupid use of words.

> Customer Service - never used it 

Again more paranioa! YOu haven't used their customer support. Then how in heaven's fuck are you in a position to criticize them? Just use it man. If you use it and don't like it then you're entitled to your opinion. Criticizing someone without ever having met them shows me the mark of a true moron.

> Many more points, but I’m getting angry just typing this. Let’s keep brewing the hate. 

WTF are you angry about dude? Chill out! Your whole post makes absolutely zero sense but you've got a lot of attention + upvotes. Oh sure! Lady luck is blind they say and in your case that's definitely true.

As for who is the customer? Seriously. If I hear that argument one more time..

Been in the market for 30 years and there has NEVER been a better time to be a retail investor. Just because you dont understand how it works is your issue. Robin hood did NOTHING wrong other than being a bit under capitalized.  Every retail brokerage (free trades) restricted trading, and have done it many times.

Gunna be honest its kinda cool. It takes a social media twist on a trade app. It works w stock twits.

And i believe you can day trade as much as youd like only under the circumstance you only day trade XYZ once. Your money takes longer to clear than rh so you cannot day trade and turn around and immediately re invest. Also the time for money to clear for withdrawal is at least 6 days or so.

RobinHood is free to you for a reason. If you want someone to call behind the phone, you need to adjust your expectations. It's a no frills brokerage. It's like going to McDonald's and expecting a waiter.

Citadel actually handles order flows for almost every online brokerages. It's not exclusive to RH.

RH didn't meet capital requirements so they couldn't continue operating as a brokerage unless they removed GME and other riskier stocks which were causing the collateral to skyrocket. The reason they allowed you to sell is because when you sell, you are relinquishing your stock and don't owe anything. It's like when you sell your house to someone vs someone buying a house. When you sell a house, you're getting your money because the bank will cover the remaining amount after the down payment while someone buying a house still has to get approved for the mortgage. Would you rather RH have just shut down their entire platform and no trading happens at all? 


Don't listen to the OP. He has no idea what he is even talking about and many of you are, sorry to say, highly misinformed about how shit works in the capital market so you're just listening to what other uninformed people are spamming.

If you at some point rapidly need all your money out of your account, you’re probably not making the best decision investing in the first place. If you had a problem with Robinhood blocking GME, you’re a gambler, not an investor. People blaming Robinhood for their own stupid investments is the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen. Robinhood made it so I can buy and sell from my phone from anywhere in the world, it’s the most easy to use way to buy stocks I’ve ever encountered. I don’t use Robinhood to research, I don’t use Robinhood to chart, and I certainly don’t use Robinhood to day trade. That would be a misuse of the service Robinhood is providing. If I wanted to do those things, I’d use a platform that was designed for those activities. Robinhood is not one of those platforms. For long term buy-and-hold investing, Robinhood is second to none in terms of convenience, ease of use, and GUI. I’ve never once had an issue with my investments that required me to immediately speak to a representative, and I have used many different brokerages over the years, including brokerages not based in the United States.

03/18/2021,stocks,"Well what would  you recommend to use? I'm VERY new to trading and have some stocks on different brokerages, yes doing the polygamy thing with them lol, but I'm seeing what indont like and do like. 

Most recent one I opened and might transfer everything to is fidelity. 

Whats wrong with Robinhood? Paper trade? What? all new to me again sorry."
03/18/2021,stocks,Anybody here invest with Chase? And if so how is it?
03/18/2021,stocks,I use Merrill edge since I have BoA
03/18/2021,stocks,What platform would you recommend?
03/18/2021,stocks,"I use Charles Schwab.  Great customer service, easy to use App, and their website has a lot of useful investment research."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I plan on moving soon but they got me with their practically free margin trading. 

Looking forward to my piece of the class action lawsuits though."
03/18/2021,stocks,Unfortunately citadel is the customer of every broker. You can't avoid them.
03/18/2021,stocks,"So what to use instead? Are there any good ones that charge you something a month or whatever?

I've been using IKBR since it gives access to options in europe but is there a better one people would recommend (and why)?"
03/18/2021,stocks,This post should be titled ‘Why you need to short RobinHood TF after floatation’
03/18/2021,stocks,What’s is the alternative for RH? What about etoro?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Hey, I'm completely new to investing, maybe y'all could give me some tips? Something like what platform should I use (small European country, so no fidelity and stuff) how to DD properly, and what should I focus on investing?"
03/18/2021,stocks,I have a few hundred growing on RH and about to dump my whole stimulus and tax returns on stocks. Wanna suggest what I should use instead?
03/18/2021,stocks,Can you direct me to another platform that doesn't have fees or require proof of address in order to trade? I'm next to homeless currently and just tryna get in on some doge..... so I'm less homeless in the future. I've tried webull and binance so far
03/18/2021,stocks,"I afraid if people start withdrawing from Robinhood, it will default."
03/18/2021,stocks,I wanna get out of Robinhood but I’m not paying $75 to transfer :/ I can’t afford that.
03/18/2021,stocks,They are all the same they are businesses that is the whole point to make tendies you are but a tiny spec of dust on their Armani suit so accept the fact they will but fuk you whenever they feel like it and just be like me a happy bottom feeder sucking up all your losses!
03/18/2021,stocks,"I moved to Webull, took advantage of that sweet promotion. It’s amazing."
03/18/2021,stocks,Who's going to robinhood looking for personal investment advice?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Fidelity also does not charge commissions for trades. Am I the product or the customer? Their customer service also sucks. I can not prove it, but I think one of the ways they make money off of me is to execute trades to and from their own portfolio at the market price if it is to their advantage, otherwise pass the execution of my trade to a market maker like Citadel."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Moved to Fidelity. They are nowhere near as flexible. If you sell a stock and want to I buy another immediately it takes ages to do. Great for investors, not sure great for day traders."
03/18/2021,stocks,After two stunts by that company that lost me money and all we hear from them is a “we’re sorry” 🤷 (picture South Park episode with BP oil CEO) yeah... I’m out
03/18/2021,stocks,"It's very interesting that Robin Hood offers a checking account as well as low margin, If you pair that with cryptocurrency and private keys things get very interesting."
03/18/2021,stocks,Im still waiting for my 1099 from them...
03/18/2021,stocks,im trying to transfer my account to fidelity. my only issue is fidelity hasn't approved my account for options yet. it looks like im going to have to call them.
03/18/2021,stocks,Good article on PFOF and the investing apps that use it: https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/which-investing-apps-receive-payment-for-order-flow
03/18/2021,stocks,"Customer service literally doesn’t exist for RH. It’s a automated response that says they’ll reach out in a few days via email. No number to call, no direct back and forth."
03/18/2021,stocks,What to use then?
03/18/2021,stocks,what about wealthsimple?
03/18/2021,stocks,I use it for quick stock checks. The UI is great. I buy on fidelity and vanguard tho.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I've used Robinhood as a small, fun money gambling account for years. I knew what I was getting with RH and I accepted that, or so I thought. 

This year they delayed sending my 1099. Apparently the IRS deadline of Feb 16 doesn't really mean much and RH can just request an extension. Robinhood blamed it on changes in my ""tax status"". 

I have much larger accounts with TastyWorks and Fidelity. Thousands of trades in each account. No ""tax status change"" in these accounts, but my $10k RH account holds up my taxes for over a month because they can't generate a simple 1099. 

Robinhood customer service consists solely of form responses via email. Considering responses only come during the middle of the night I think it's safe to assume all customer service is outsourced. They literally don't have a phone number to call."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I want to get away from RH, but I’m not sure which other brokerage to use. Any suggestion on one that has just as good of an interface?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Dipping my toe into stock information. By that I mean - I knew they exist, but I don't know much else. Yes, the GameStop thing brought my lack of knowledge to my attention. 

If RH is not a good choice, who is? Can you make some other suggestions?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"for anyone who is in uk i would suggest to use freetrade! just way better, you own your own shares  that are in separate accounts from anyone else shares"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Who do you recommend that allows OTC trading, doesn't charge fees (I already lose money, I don't need to give any more away), and has a mobile app?"
03/18/2021,stocks,What’s the best alternative? (newbie here)
03/18/2021,stocks,"ASKO aims to provide investors and community a cost effective Lend and Borrow Platform, while retaining high yields and profitability on ASKOLend"
03/18/2021,stocks,Robinhood is trash.
03/18/2021,stocks,I just use them to buy doge cause I can’t on Webull
03/18/2021,stocks,"I understand that RH isn't the way to go, but does anyone here have an opinion about Webull ?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I left Robberhood February 8th and they still haven’t given my new brokerage my cost basis on my stonks. I called my broker the other day and they said RH is having difficulties, and it could be another 3 weeks before my cost basis will be available."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I started with RH a few months back. Luckily I hadn’t made many investments before the meme stock frenzy so I was able to switch over to Fidelity quite easily. However I can see how some may struggle to withdrawal there funds in a timely manner if RH decides to hold some of your funds for a few days. This happened to me but like I said, it weren’t much money, so I just transferred money to fidelity from my bank account until I was able to retrieve my funds on RH. I’m still using RH for crypto, so if anybody has some options for me so I can completely get off of RH I’m all ears and am ready and willing, because they are really pissing me off. I had ZYNE stock and a few days ago it took off to the moon but they halted trading at $7 until after market hours and by then I couldn’t sell until the next morning where it fell $2. They claimed the SEC told them to do it, which is probably more truthful than “due to market volatility blah blah blah” Or “there were so many orders we couldn’t possibly keep up” or “ in Bulgaria, my home land” but nevertheless, it’s still BS"
03/18/2021,stocks,The customer service is terrible
03/18/2021,stocks,How would you switch? Do you have to sell everything and transfer the cash to a different account?
03/18/2021,stocks,I’m waiting for my tramito go through
03/18/2021,stocks,Curious what other brokers allow fractional trading?
03/18/2021,stocks,"They also have the best UX by far of any brokerage app, and i don’t care about any of the above. Open up an IRA at vanguard if you want one. RH is totally fine for new investors, if you’re putting a ton of money into a trading account, you’re likely not a new investor and know to go elsewhere for real capital allocation."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You ever heard someone say “Come to me with a solution, not a problem”? So RH bad, got it. Where should I go?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I have about $85 left in RH. At this point its my ""fuck around"" money. What do i mean by that? It was all that was left after I pulled everything ans decided to play a game. Most of my stocks are ones I plan on holding for a long while. This money however, is going to be my fast and furious, buy low and sell the instant I make any money the next day kind of deal. I want to see how high I can get it."
03/18/2021,stocks,So would you recommend liquidating my account or doing an acats before doing the switch?
03/18/2021,stocks,Is Webull in the same boat as Robin Hood? ( I currently use Ed Jones)
03/18/2021,stocks,Like many people before me I started using RH last year and found the ease to navigate simple to use and thought it was great. A year later seeing all the fuckery going on with them I setup a fidelity account. I have some calls open still on RH that I’m waiting on before I completely close out my RH account.
03/18/2021,stocks,"So for those of us that want to switch platforms, what should we do with the money we have invested in RH?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"As an European (Slovenia), what platform should I use?"
03/18/2021,stocks,Is webull ok
03/18/2021,stocks,Are there other brokerages that do instant deposits? I use both Vanguard beacon and RH and honestly that and the fact robinhoods app interface for some reason seems better is the reason I haven't switched completely
03/18/2021,stocks,"Who actually ows your shares is Citadel which resales it in the market creating naked shares after naked shares after naked shares. 

They abuse of hypothecation system’s loopholes to make a quick profit but leave the market with fraudulent transactions.

They have been sued many times over fraud charges but they keep doing the same thing."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Platforms to stay away.
Robinhood
TD

They are consistently restricting trading to MM advantage."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Transferred to Schwab and couldn't be happier. Was able to make a Joint account for myself and my wife, set up a Roth IRA, and feel like I have way more other tools to work with compared to Robinhood. 

Then there's the customer service. I can reach someone at Schwab 24/7, whether it's by chat, phone, or email. Try reaching Robinhood and let me know how that goes for you.

The one positive I will give Robinhood is their interface, and how easy it is to quickly see at a glance how a stock is doing for the day/week/month/3m/etc. Getting that same information from Schwab isn't nearly as fast and easy. Once the other brokerages finally get with the 21st century, I can't imagine there will be a place for someone like Robinhood, especially now that RH's biggest strength, allowing to investors to trade commission-free, is now becoming the standard."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I moved all of my stocks to Fidelity, just left my crypto. I don't want to sell yet the tax will sting. I can't wait until they allow us to move crypto out to our own wallets. The last article I read in February said they were working on it. They need to move faster.

03/18/2021,stocks,If anyone needs a Webull referral it would be awesome if you used my code!
03/18/2021,stocks,With the short AMC rebound the other day I was able to liquidate my remaining positions at cost and finally pull everything out of RH. Such a scummy company. Vanguard here we come!
03/18/2021,stocks,"Definitely don't leave robinhood to go to webull or etoro either, if you're out go to a respected veteran broker like fidelity."
03/18/2021,stocks,Schwab in my opinion is the best
03/18/2021,stocks,Closed RH account last night.
03/18/2021,stocks,Can I transfer out of RH if I have covered calls I sold that haven't expired yet?
03/18/2021,stocks,"I agree with all these points, but the problem for me is I like ease of use. Especially with the app. I want to be able to use the app easily and with efficiency. If I’m on the move during the day, and buying or selling a volatile stock, the fidelity app doesn’t measure up. I’m new to buying stocks and basically still learning the ropes.  I don’t use Robinhood to do my DD, I just use it to buy and sell.  That being said, I’d rather have the better tech than better customer service. For now at least."
03/18/2021,stocks,Anyone still using RH is an idiot. Dollar votes people
03/18/2021,stocks,I use the evil bank of evil Bank of America- Merrill Lynch. They give you 30x free trades per month if combined between BoA and ML you're above a certain amount. I like the interface but I haven't tried any other platform. Anyone have thoughts on MLs system?
03/18/2021,stocks,They finally accepted my transfer today. Bye bye Robinhood. And fuck you Vlad!
03/18/2021,stocks,Where should I go then? I’m still new to trading and Robinhood just made getting into it easy. I’m all for leaving the platform after all the GME stuff but where do I go? What do you more experienced guys recommend?
03/18/2021,stocks,"This argument is so stale and overblown, especially coming from someone who’s never experienced the thing they’re talking about. The comparison to Facebook is where this argument really falls apart: Are there people who use Facebook excessively and oughtn’t share just about all of their information? Of course, and that’s potentially dangerous or at least a liability. But there are also people who use Facebook responsibly and sparingly to keep in touch easily with old friends in a way that’s more dynamic than email and more convenient than a phone call or in-person meeting. The same is true of Robinhood: Just like any trading in individual stocks, the average retail investor should probably trade very, very little, and place 90% or more of their non-retirement and non-savings money into something very vanilla like VTI. That’s what I’ve done — a few individual stocks that are hardly speculative (e.g., AAPL, AMZN), and otherwise my non-retirement investments are in VTI or Vanguard mutual funds. I’d really like to see an argument for how I’m really losing out by using Robinhood in this way, and please spare me the “you might not be getting the best price” argument, as that one’s pretty weak, too. Also, I’ve had almost no need at all for customer service in 4 years and the service I got from Robinhood was just fine — quite comparable to what I’ve gotten from Vanguard, where I have my IRA and other kinds of investments. And, as far as leadership is concerned, please don’t try to tell me that Jaime Dimon, Walter Bettinger, and all the other brokerage CEO’s are dying to take care of you."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Fidelity won’t allow me to have a level 2+ options trading, yet RH will. I’d like to make the switch over but I’m afraid I have to stay with RH until fidelity allows me to level up my options trading."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm pretty glad that I started trading after the Robinhood scandal.  I was considering investing through them because of their user friendly approach to trading.

Thankfully they showed their ass before I bought in, and I elected to do the smart thing and open a Fidelity account instead (with whom I already have a 401K, so opening a brokerage account was a trivial matter).

Fidelity has been fantastic to me so far."
03/18/2021,stocks,Thank you
03/18/2021,stocks,Which broker should be used instead?
03/18/2021,stocks,I only use RH for the user friendly UI 📊. I monitor graphs there but trade elsewhere
03/18/2021,stocks,I’m trying to get out of robinhood and while doing so I was looking at my account statements and they all say account type ‘margin’ but I’ve only ever deposited money from my bank to by stocks? Is there another reason why it would say this? Also does anyone know how to find account title?
03/18/2021,stocks,SRVA? Thoughts?
03/18/2021,stocks,"I couldn’t deactivate my account bc I still have some money left like 0.0002 cents. Bruh, eff that app. Just delete it."
03/18/2021,stocks,"SVRA? 
Thoughts?"
03/18/2021,stocks,Citadel handles order flows for almost every online brokerages. A lot of you are simply just running around spreading b/s around. All of OP's points are just laughably bad. RobinHood is still fairly new to equity trading in the grand scheme of things. They don't have the capital that established players such as Charles Schwab will have.
03/18/2021,stocks,It’s not going anywhere. And with more younger investors wanting in on the action they’ll probably use RH. Not knowing that there is no “free lunch”
03/18/2021,stocks,"Customer service - horrific. Took me weeks to get an answer on my account. 

They listed me as “ on margin “ for using instant deposit (that cleared and noting is on margin) - so fidelity is handling that end, they are used to it now apparently. 

I did a transfer, a partial transfer, of my stocks to fidelity. I kept some positions that aren’t volatile, to keep the processing time down (supposedly - I’m still in the transfer) 

This is insane what Rh is up to. I’m so thankful for the DD, or else I’d be screwed."
03/18/2021,stocks,"The retail investors will never forget that time where they completely locked buying GME and yet still allowed the sell button on GME. CLEAR FRAUDULENT MANIPULATION. I highly recommend Webull or maybe EToro. When they had to lock buying on GME, they also locked selling so they didn’t manipulate the stock. I’d at least trust them more than RH. These scumbags can NEVER BE TRUSTED AGAIN!!!! These fraudulent criminals deserve to be put into a cell alongside their scumbag friends"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Ok, so what's a better app? Schwab looks like it's from the 80s. Webull is information overload.

What's a better app than Robinhood?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Op, in your opinion what is the next best app for trading stocks? Vanguard sucks and I don't trust RH.  

What alternative can you recommend?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"It is not a platform for trading. Some of your biggest opportunities to make money are during high volatility and stressed markets. They failed that test.

I would only recommend them as a starter account. First time savers with limited funds and you are buying and holding a ETFs. Never looking at the account. Then maybe."
03/18/2021,stocks,Could you recommend any good alternatives I could use on my phone? I work a really busy day every day of the week and only have time to glimpse at my stuff.
03/18/2021,stocks,What about Stash?
03/18/2021,stocks,Not to mention limitations. There are great OTC stocks with a ton of potential that you can’t buy on Robinhood.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I take serious issue with you categorizing them as a tech company with a ""core competency [being] software development."" When you consider that their whole app went down multiple times last year due to failures in their infrastructure it seems kinda ridiculous."
03/18/2021,stocks,How do i move my portfolio from RH to some other platform?
03/18/2021,stocks,What other choice do I have? There’s no other apps that will let me daytrade btc without commission.
03/18/2021,stocks,I recently tried to transfer all of my stocks from Robinhood to Schwab. Robinhood emailed me a few days later saying they fucked up and I have to re-initiate the transfer. Thanks Robinhood
03/18/2021,stocks,Bot
03/18/2021,stocks,I am just transferring over to Webull. My dumb brain likes the green colors but my smart brain likes widgets. I'll probably keep RH for visuals only and only have one or two shares in it. I do enjoy the simplistic rundowns of everything
03/18/2021,stocks,"Plus: When you start an account, it's set to use margin (BORROWING MONEY) by default, not the money you actually deposit.  


(I read this somewhere, don't know 100% if it's true.)"
03/18/2021,stocks,I wouldn’t trust Vlad to make my pizza.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Your money really is at stake, and yet the shares on RH are glorified IOUs. It's important to ensure your shares are held in cash accounts and not margin, so your shares aren't easily lent out to be shorted, as is the case with GeeME."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm a new investor, and started with RH, I made the mistake of getting marked as a day trader, and have been reading on and on on why I shouldn't use RH. Once I sell off my other assets I'll be shutting down my acct.

I've looked into using different brokerages, tried fidelity but I didn't like how unuser friendly their interface was. 
Would anybody consider using Webull?"
03/18/2021,stocks,I use robinhood because I'm a small trader. If you want to front run my trade you'll get .01% of a cent because I'm only buying 20 shares. I'd rather pay that than $.65. Place limit ordered and you won't get gouged
03/18/2021,stocks,"I have TDAmeritrade, but nothing in it yet. Should I switch from RH to TD.A then? Have yet to switch because didn’t know where to switch to yet"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Seems like all trading apps have their own issues. Makes it real difficult to make $$$ was trying to catch a dip on GME yesterday, but with all the bullcrap fees it was $265 when it was at $208 on the market. Not worth it!!"
03/18/2021,stocks,Market makers don't want you to know this. But you can Direct Route on some brokers to the exchanges. Therefore directly affecting the price and cutting off the middle man. Yeah your broker won't get PFOF and will probably start charging fees like before. But it's either one or the other. I my self am fine with a 5 dollar fee if it means keeping my trade information away from the market makers who's job is to create liquidity in the market BUT can legally TRADE FOR THEIR OWN BOOK against my information if they choose to.
03/18/2021,stocks,Okay so what easily accessible/ brokerage fee free services are there ?
03/18/2021,stocks,Waiting to sell my stocks off and then switch. Will probably take some time off to research stocks and be a little more educated next time around.
03/18/2021,stocks,Don’t other brokerages offering free trading do the same thing?
03/18/2021,stocks,I play with the bad boys so I’m at IBKR
03/18/2021,stocks,"My long term stock is PZQA

It can be bought on Degiro"
03/18/2021,stocks,What broker would you recommend?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yep, I was on their platform and deleted them immediately after the GME fiasco. I’m not doing business with people involved in a rigged system."
03/18/2021,stocks,REMINDER: RobinHood's app reviews have gone up to 2 stars. Would be ashame if we all did something about that...
03/18/2021,stocks,i always considered it sketchy..
03/18/2021,stocks,Shout out to Fidelity. Ive been using them forever now and they’re great. No fees and you can get a live American person on the phone just about any time of the day. They have really good customer service in my experience. I also have opened a checking account with them too. My only complaint is it does take a day or two longer for cash to settle after it’s been transferred in from an outside account.
03/18/2021,stocks,Yeah I can’t believe real brokerages aren’t capable of investing $20 into building an actual decent app....if fidelity had a UI like Robinhood I would transfer every fucking penny I have to them and never even consider leaving.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yea. The fuckers stole money from me when they liquidated my ACB shares during the reverse split. I should have received cash in lieu, since I had less than 6 shares, but they never deposited the cash.

Evil fuckers!"
03/18/2021,stocks,Good information on this thread.. Plan on transferring out of RH asap 💪
03/18/2021,stocks,"Fuck Robinhood, I and everyone I know has posted a negative review after the GME fiasco"
03/18/2021,stocks,I hear this loud and clear. But here's my biggest issue. Robinhood enables DCA into any equity. That is sooooo important (to me at least). I cannot find another broker who can replicate this.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Don’t forget. Not your keys, not your crypto."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Also I was using DRIP in robinhood, switched over to Ameritrade and started using DRIP.

Some of my dividend stocks are handing out discounts to people who use DRIP.

Lets use GENERICSTOCK for example. I had 50 shares and got 9.50 in dividends last month, well with TD Ameritrade I got over one share even though the list price was $13. With robinhood I had only been receiving fractional shares.

Edit: I did call Ameritrade and they basically said that stock gave a discount on list price for reinvesting in the company."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I am grateful to Robinhood because it was my first foray into investing. With that said, I transferred everything to another brokerage and feel much better for it. I have retained the app just so I can easily look up AH stock movements from my phone, but I don’t foresee myself returning beyond that."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Your also not the customer, the customer is whoever they sell the order flow too. You are part of the input. Like cows to the slaughter."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yea, duh."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I have a Fidelity account, but I’m scared of transferring my assets in case GME decides to take off. 

What should I do?"
03/18/2021,stocks,Should I sell off my GME shares on a peak and rebuy on WeBull? WSB is telling me not to but I got like 5 shares. I'm a small fish and can't justify the 75 buck brokerage transfer fee.
03/18/2021,stocks,Switched to Td and haven’t looked back. I have a smaller account that I can’t say trade margin. I traded 5 day trades one day thinking I would get flagged. So I call Td they answer quickly and inform that you don’t need to have a margin account if you have cash in your account and you can say trade your heart away. Moral of the story having a customer support that answers and gives you the correct info is amazing. Also think or swim is great once you get used to it.

03/18/2021,stocks,Is there a way to transfer your stocks to another platform?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Man....I just started investing more actively this year to try and change my life. I thought RH was easy to get into, and then all this happened. I'm really concerned now, but I'm afraid that if I move everything I have to another broker, I'll lose something or pay a convenience fee of sorts. What can I do to avoid that?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Agreed. I found a helpful list of all the available Robinhood alternatives here:

03/18/2021,stocks,Robinhood exists to make robinhood rich not you. Thats why you dont use robinhood.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Started my transfer to fidelity last night, hope it goes reasonably fast. 

Does anyone know if I need to do anything with the transfer of assets form that was generated by fidelity?"
03/18/2021,stocks,There are so many brokers with free trades it literally makes no sense to use RH. Amateur hour.
03/18/2021,stocks,Ive heard a lot of anti-RH posts and I totally agree but when I ask for reccomendations on who to switch to no one offers any help. So here I am a new investor still with RH because I dont want to pull out until I have an alternative.
03/18/2021,stocks,"eh, its free and allows fractional shares along with crypto. Good enough for a poor college student with a small portfolio."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm a fairly new investor, almost a year in. I have both a Schwab and RH account. I started on RH. I currently only use RH for options, because the platform is so use friendly and UI is clean, but my stock portfolio is managed within Schwab.  
  
Is there a negative to this, will the actual prices or return be different (i.e. less efficient) using RH for options over an established brokerage like Schwab? Genuinely curious."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I want to add a few red flags I have seen as well. For starters the inexistent customer service is like going into a dark ally where you know at any moment a gang rivalry might happen and you aren’t even wearing a shirt. It’s fckn RISKY SHIT, and there is no need for it when you can get to a real person with TD, or Fidelity etc within the hour! 

Next, many posts have come out showing inaccurate cost basis when transferring shares, as well as errors in the reporting for the tax documents. Idk if they are actually intentionally fuckn stealing or if it’s a big in their report creation. Either way ... UNACCEPTABLE. 

Next the education services, RH is still in that development phase of their learning but fidelity and TD have legit courses about every strategy under the sun, and they actually know what they are talking about. Idk if RH is reputable enough to really teach as previously mentioned they are a tech company and their client is citadel. 

Lastly, I want young people to start off my investing in a ROTH IRA with some mutual funds. Keep the stock picking and trading in an individual account, but always have that 6k just sitting and growing and not gambling with it. Don’t miss out on the years of compounding by day or swing trading. 

RH is killing you is on terrible spreads and fills. And it can’t change! If they are using dark pools citadel has to buy the real shares at the real market price and sell it back to you for some kind of profit. Shady shit guys, why are we even going to this lame ass party when you got an invite to TD’s boat party with security and good food. 

I also recall a redit post about someone’s email getting hacked and not setting up two factor authentication and the hacker changed his RH recovery email address and he never got it resolved! Are u fuckn kidding me. TD won’t let me change my pass unless I answer 3 security questions give them my voice record and it’s just like... how in the world did I ever let money sit in RH even when I had two factor. 

Just RUN a away from RH this isn’t even about the whole GME heart ache that happened these are legit reasons to not ever go to them for jack shit. They have a great UI, awesome, cool. But bye bitch just bye"
03/18/2021,stocks,ok
03/18/2021,stocks,Lots of my money plus no customer service.  Sign me up!!!!!!
03/18/2021,stocks,"I've been slowly phasing them out, finally pulling the plug now. Their GUI is the best which is what has kept me with a small amount on there thus far but too many reasons not to have $$ in there. No customer support, the shady GME stuff, not to mention every time I try to sell my contracts on there the price instantly moves when I put my order in. I'd much rather pay $1 per trade and get them filled reasonably than $0 per trade but have it instantly move against me and then end up paying an extra $10 per trade effectively.

Not to mention that they botched the leap year among other things. Just not reliable and it's a risky place to have your money."

03/18/2021,stocks,I'm curious how they think any other brokerage can afford to do free trading. Your one bad apple is likely the norm for all the others that jumped on board once they realized how to do it.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I made a couple posts a while back, linking to this petition, that never took off because the timing was bad, right when the initial squeeze was shut down as Robinhood restricted trading, and many apes were trying to get their money out.  I think it's time now.  Robinhood are a bunch of crooks, and their business model is bad for retail investors, whether you use their services or not.  Shut them down, please sign!

[change.org shut down Robinhood ](http://chng.it/564W2XgT6H)"
03/18/2021,stocks,I'd say RH was good at getting more people into investing due to it's ease of access and viral marketing.  It is a terrible brokerage however.  I do hope those that have not yet gotten burned by RH can move their portfolio before it's too late however.
03/18/2021,stocks,Robinhood trash. Please do not use!
03/18/2021,stocks,"Since the Robinhood fiasco, I've transferred 99% to fidelity. However have kept my Robinhood account solely for the interface. Make my buying decisions on Robinhood but make actual transactions in fidelity until they can update their UI."
03/18/2021,stocks,i gave it a try. invested $10. it wouldn't let me buy almost anything. ended up putting in another 10. doubled it in a few days. then they labelled me an insider trader and said i had to put in 25K more. it was VERY difficult to close my account. never again...
03/18/2021,stocks,So I tried to transfer my balance to Fidelity but the transfer didn’t go through. I am sort of happy about this as RH user interface was so much easier for me to use. I would still like to switch but which ones would you guys recommend? I started with RH and have done quite well and would like a brokerage with a similar UI and free trades.
03/18/2021,stocks,Finally was able to close/deactivate my RH account this week. Felt so good.
03/18/2021,stocks,Yeah man fuck them I hope they go out of business or atleast lost 80% clientele
03/18/2021,stocks,I've been looking to get out of webull for the simple fact that I want to join a 'big boy' brokerage and not deal with the bullshit thats been happening lately. Are there any non commission charging brokerages that don't work through payment for order flow? Are Schwab and TDA the same? I know schwab acquired TDA but do they offer the same services? Does vanguard offer trading or is it strictly mutual funds and other boomer financial services? Vanguard however is attractive to me cause I wouldn't mind setting up something like a mutual fund to go along with my stock trading. I don't mind commissions as long as they don't charge an arm and a leg. Thanks in advance.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Biggest problem w robinhood is it doesn't show enough information for tax planning like unrealized/ realized gain loss over long term and short term, and broken out at different lots. Also can't switch to lifo."
03/18/2021,stocks,Well tell fidelity to get their UI out of the 90s and I will make the switch.
03/18/2021,stocks,Fuck that company. Half-assed to the core.

03/18/2021,stocks,Who should we use?
03/18/2021,stocks,I tried to sell to close on my phone for a half hour and because it's a pos I lost $200. I wouldn't set rh up for my high school bully.

03/18/2021,stocks,"How do I go about transferring the current stocks I have in Robinhood to the other brokerages that I use now (Fidelity and Webull at the moment)? I don't have much in Robinhood, it's only worth about $230 but I'd like to transfer out"
03/18/2021,stocks,I fucking hate them and dont want to keep them at all but the ability to buy/sell options is the only thing keeping some of my play money there. Fidelity is making it so fucking annoying to get approved to even just buy a call and I haven't heard of any better US brokers where I dont have to jump through a million hoops to deal in options.
03/18/2021,stocks,After the fact RH manipulted GME in their exchange people still use it? LOL
03/18/2021,stocks,I tried transferring my RH account to Fidelity. I initiated the transfer and the following day I have a negative account balance. All my shares from RH were showing on margin. I called Fidelity and they stated RH tried sending them debt so they rejected the transfer. After a few days my Fidelity account went back to normal and I had to unsuspend my RH account. Going to try again soon. Did anyone else experience this? How did you resolve it. TIA!

03/18/2021,stocks,"I am a fan of M1. Fractional shares, etc. Uses a pie concept and you can add your own pieces. Rebalance easy. Can add stocks, bonds, funds and etfs to any pie. Cash account pays 1%. Browser and mobile apps are good."
03/18/2021,stocks,"So, I have a question. I use TD ameritrade and they basically operate under the same model right? Free trades because of selling order flow. It used to be a commission based service, but it's obviously gone the way of RH when it comes to trades.  Do you see the same issues using this platform?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I transferred all of my positions to Fidelity today, now starts the sweating that the GME train will pop off while it's in limbo. :("

03/18/2021,stocks,"I got marked a pattern day trader 3 times for selling one stock 3 times (bought stock once, sold 3 times). They restricted my account from buying even crypto for 90 days. It sucks"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Dumb question, why would anyone not just use a typical reputable company like Fidelity? I have never had issues with them an online their app. 

Why does robin hood have so many users?"
03/18/2021,stocks,And today I woke up and opened a robinhood account and have lost $4 since this morning.... everything's going to shit lol
03/18/2021,stocks,I'm still using robinhood and have yet to transfer because of my GME shares there. I'll wait it out but I'm no longer transferring any money into it and have already been using TD. Robinhood will no longer get anything from me and whatever I have there will stay in there until I close it out. My main concern is just my GME shares. Once GME finishes up I'll transfer everything out.
03/18/2021,stocks,"None of what you said really makes any real world difference. How does any of that affect me or my portfolio. They had a single-time funding issue... once. That's it. I tried to use Fidelity, but honest it was like stepping back into the 80s when I logged into their platform. There was no ease of use at all, information was spread everywhere, the app gave me outdated info half the time and their charts suck. Hell, even browsing stocks was straight up painful. I was able to actually get ahold of someone at Robinhood. I never was at Fidelity. I called and waited forever. Tried to use the chat agent, that was an endless loop of BS.   


Most of the arguments you can make against RH are just as bad, or worse, at the other brokerages. I get that people are upset that they biffed it with GME. But, honestly, they jumped through their ass to fix it. They secured 600 million in funding in less than 24 hours to open it back up. If they were the ONLY ones it happened to, I'd understand more, I guess. But all except a handful had to shut down GME trades.   


Honestly, they're fine. They're not an advanced platform. They're an easy platform. And if that's what you want, they're second to none. If you want advanced/mature? Good luck. They all suck from an UX perspective."
03/18/2021,stocks,Easy to use alternatives for a beginner with some money to play with and lose?
03/18/2021,stocks,I will say their app design is like an Apple product crisp and clean plus I’m a sucker for the graph on All but other than that terrible
03/18/2021,stocks,"Switched to Schwab, am very pleased."
03/18/2021,stocks,Their interface is amazing but under the hood it's trash
03/18/2021,stocks,Pretty much all your points were assumptions lol. At least give a real argument rather than a quick shitpost.
03/18/2021,stocks,Fuck robinhood! Td ameritrade for the WIN
03/18/2021,stocks,If you can find a broker that has great UI like RH I’d be happy to jump
03/18/2021,stocks,"Hey everyone,

Like many of you, I am considering transferring my stocks in Robinhood (around $31k) over to Fidelity.   I sat on the phone, on hold with Fidelity for 45 minutes before I hung up, so I’m hoping I can have my questions answered here.

Fidelity will transfer my exact number of shares at my exact average price, correct?  There is no disconnect here?

Partial shares cannot be transferred, but Fidelity does allow the purchase of partial shares - correct?

Is there a transaction fee to buy/sell on Fidelity , or any monthly fees or required minimums in the account?

No crypto on Fidelity.  If I keep my crypto on Robinhood and transfer everything else - is that unwise?   I don’t want to use RH anymore, honestly, but I’m also not keen on cashing in my crypto investments at the time either. 

Anything I’m forgetting or overlooking?

Thanks!"
03/18/2021,stocks,Retail traders will always be the product. The order flow being dealt to outside party is the conflict. Fidelity offers free trading. They value that data. But so they sell it externally?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Customer service is lousy with everyone at the moment, I don’t know much about Robinhood... 

I use TDA for my daily trades and they are good at picking the phone up, but good luck getting any adviser or broker on the phone with an account less than 250k lol. I have a good amount and I’ve been waiting over a week for a phone conference ( all the brokerages are closed in California).

Aside from the lack of getting an advisor TDA / ThinkorSwim is pretty good. I’ve also heard some great things from Fidelity. 

I also have Merrill Lynch account but that’s an inheritance fund of stocks."
03/18/2021,stocks,That's nice. But the UI blows everyone else out if the water and its not even close. I cant switch

03/18/2021,stocks,"I see RH hate, I upvote."
03/18/2021,stocks,The reason I would never use Robinhood isn't because ofbth bad press. It is because of how easy they make it to spend money.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I am sure I am restating the obvious. DUH!!

They have stopped trading or had black outs at very convenient times for their company that has ended in fucking over their users.

It’s because they are CFD. They give no fucks about their users.....

Also their risk management department is non existent so if you are holding more then the Insurance limit either 100k or 200k unsure.

When they actually get liquidated on a margin call your Fucked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Transferred over to fidelity but now I gotta deal with that bullshit 75$ fee. It’s going to take months to recover that in stocks, but it’s worth getting away from Robinhood"
03/18/2021,stocks,I just completed my transfer to webull but the shitty thing is they fucked up my average.  I had a 1.13 now after the transfer webull has me at 17.82 wtf?  Is there a way to put it back? Does it matter?
03/18/2021,stocks,Excellent points. Your point about tech company’s having terrible customer service only leads me to allocate more funds into AAPL during this dip. Not every single one is the same!

03/18/2021,stocks,I got in not knowing about GME and heard all the crap they were doing to freeze peoples accounts and immediately transferred out. Now I find out a friend is buying bitcoin from them. Is that safe? I dunno but my investing is out of RH after I heard they froze people from buying/selling. Its just very revealing about who they are and where their interests are.
03/18/2021,stocks,"It makes me lol when I still see Robinhood on lists of ""IPOs to keep an eye on in 2021"". Like who in their right mind would want to get aboard that sinking ship right now, especially when they are so blatant about helping HF and not retail investors? Hard pass."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Never reward abusive behavior. RH screw you guys and gals. When some restricts your availability to buy a stock because they “can’t clear transactions “ that is not your fault.

03/18/2021,stocks,"Yea, that's what happened to that one guy where there was a glitch that made it look like he was thousands of dollars in debt to Robinhood and he committed suicide. After he had done it they had finally responded saying that it was a glitch and he was all good. If they had a reasonable level of customer service, that guy would be alive."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yep. Someone hacked into my account during the start of the GME stuff and was buying stocks with my money, and no matter how many times I used RH’s process to change my pw and restrict my account, it kept getting rehacked.

If I do an account transfer to my Fidelity account and/or Schwab or something.... will they automatically grant me a lvl 3 options account? Or am I still needing to be re-approved by my new account?"
03/18/2021,stocks,And this is just what we know about— so there’s liuu Likely much much more under the surface. “Just the tip...”
03/18/2021,stocks,"I initiated my transfer to Fidelity last night. I saw all the posts and thought it didnt apply to me, I opened a cash acct. Went and checked my statement. Nope. Everything said margin. I know the squeeze might happen while the shares are being transferred. I hope not, but its possible. But the way I figure it is what good is cashing out at the peak of the squeeze is RH isnt going to have the cash to pay all of us anyways?"
03/18/2021,stocks,Any advice on others to use? All criticisms of them welcome.
03/18/2021,stocks,What is the better brokerage? TD ameritrade ? How do I move all my stocks out of RH ?
03/18/2021,stocks,"I suppose now that I'm out of gme, and more volatile plays I need to commit to the transfer already.     Going fidelity since my IRA is already there"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Schwab does fractional shares, but not for all stocks and it requires a minimum of $5 spent. So yes, in your example, $5.34 is fine.

AFAIK, the only way to get an instant deposit with them in your brokerage/IRA is to set up a checking account through them as well. All transfers from one Schwab account to the other are instant. For now I'm sticking with my current bank but I've considered making the swap."
03/18/2021,stocks,Schwab and Fidelity both have fractional share purchasing now.
03/18/2021,stocks,Fidelity
03/18/2021,stocks,"I will completely shut my RH acc down after they IPO so they see a decrease in accounts after the info is public and investors will hopefully see a downtrend in accounts.

Hopefully others can join me"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Can we invest AGAINST it by shorting it? Of course, while managing risk by buying a way OTM call once those go live to prevent RH from flying 🚀🌕"
03/18/2021,stocks,"100%.

That is , as long as you actually apply this to your life and not just a Reddit thread. Which most don't ..."
03/18/2021,stocks,No reason to not take advantage of IPO volatility.
03/18/2021,stocks,That would mean shorting Robinhood. Otherwise the money isn't put anywhere.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I completed a full transfer from RH to Fidelity a week or so ago. The transfer took 2-4 days at most. What took a long time was getting approved for options trading, oddly enough. Which you have to do for your options to accepted by Fidelity in the transfer. The application for options trading can take awhile to be approved.

1. To be options-approved, you must set your Risk Tolerance profile to “Most Aggressive”. I set mine to one notch below Most Aggressive because I’m not out here naked short selling, so my initial options request was denied after pending for about a week 🙄🙄🙄

2. I changed the Risk Tolerance and re-submitted for Options Level 2 (I only occasionally buy a long call or put with intent to exercise it). It took a couple a weeks, and they only approved Level 1.

3. Immediately resubmitted and they approved Level 2 after a week or so. Then I submitted my ACAT transfer out of RH.

Hopefully that helps some people. Also, after phoning Fidelity, apparently as soon as you’re approved at any level of options trading, they’ll accept any inbound options on a transfer; they’ll only allow you to close those positions but not reopen a similar one thru Fidelity until you’re approved at the proper level. I didn’t know that at the time, but don’t delay a transfer once you’re approved for options at some level, because I spent all of February with my holding sitting in RH unnecessarily.

Much happier in Fidelity though. Great info for proper valuations and things like that, and they don’t breach breach their fiduciary duty to their investors just so Daddy’s margin call isn’t so bad. I hope RH fucking tanks in their IPO."
03/18/2021,stocks,Did fidelity reimburse you for the ACAT transfer fee?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Wouldn't your GME and AMC ""be safe from his clutches"" by moving it over? I'm not following."
03/18/2021,stocks,Can you transfer your whole shares and leave your fractional shares RH?
03/18/2021,stocks,I'm thinking of transferring over to Fidelity but I'm afraid of losing something or paying a fee. Is there a guide to doing all this?
03/18/2021,stocks,"This right here, same thing happened for me."
03/18/2021,stocks,Welcome to every “Free Market”
03/18/2021,stocks,"You sold your shares rather than transferred them?

That’s either going to help or hurt come next  April"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Vlad’s dumbass couldn’t really explain it properly. What they did was nothing illegal, just a lack of liquid cash."
03/18/2021,stocks,But didn’t every other broker (other than Vanguard and Fidelity) impose the same restrictions that RH did? I’m not sure why people still think RH was the only broker to impose those restrictions.
03/18/2021,stocks,"“Thank very much for that question, Mr / Ms Congressperson. When I was a boy in Bulgaria...”"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Careful with paper trading . Don’t get cocky with the result from paper trading and yolo with real money thinking you’re the next best trader. It’s good for learning how spreads work, call, put, etc. I’ve seen way too many people thinking they’re ready to be a millionaire after they turned 50k fake money into 100k fake money."
03/18/2021,stocks,Keep trucking.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Check out Fidelity's desktop app before you get too deep in TDA, I found it much more intuitive to use than the ToS software. TDA also has fees on certain stocks that Fidelity doesn't that made switching an easy choice for me. But Ameritrade is a good broker you wouldn't go wrong with them.  
  
edit: maybe disregard if you meant ThinkorSwim mobile. Fidelity's mobile app is uh, not so good."
03/18/2021,stocks,Keep in mind that TDA charges something like $6.50 on all position changes on OTC pennies. Fidelity has a lot of those and won’t charge you a fee.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Boy, ToS is hard... I've been using WeBull for a while and the desktop is much cleaner.
Maybe I just need more time on ToS"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I have half my investments at TDA, I think they're pretty great. I have to say their customer service has been top notch. You can't say that about any brokerage."
03/18/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/18/2021,stocks,"They sell order flow too, but still better than RH"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I use ToS to look at stuff, but another broker to trade. You have to make an account with TDA, but you don't have to put any money into it in order to use ToS"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Agreed and I disagree with most points in the OP. OP is stretching to find some random reasons and because Robinhood is so despised it still gets upvoted.

I kind of am happy to see hate on Robinhood, because I think this will ultimately motivate platforms generally to allow limitless trading and full power to it's users, but in reality I'm not sure if all the hate is actually justified. I'm just saying, I'm not sure, not that it isn't. The reason being, what could they've done to not halt trading on GME? If they could've done something then I agree the hate is justified. PS: I have never used Robinhood and I'm from Europe."
03/18/2021,stocks,I don't get why we care who their money comes from. The real question is will my brokerage prevent me from participating in the market the way I want to?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Amazing people believe shit like he posted. Their real customer is citadel? Read a book, or google market structure. Oh, and the app is free."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I don’t doubt they make money off your data but their largest revenue source is through Payment of Order Flow. Even though they are commission free trading, they still take fraction of pennies from every share you trade. Nearly brokerage that offers commission free trading does this but RH has had a history where they do not disclose how their rate (which makes users believe that they are slightly inflating shares prices within their app). 

It’s not noticeable if you buy 1 share, but if you do options trading or make a large volume order than it will be noticeable."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Broker consolidation is a trend I think will continue into the future.  If we did get rid of 90% of brokerages, it’s a good sign that either the business model is flawed, they found a niche but find it unsustainable, or customers realize they can get better service elsewhere or some combination of the three.  So, what’s the issue with getting rid of business models that are not customer centric?

Everyone makes money off data, but can’t (mostly) extrapolate directly into where it goes on a balance sheet.  We do know, however, where fidelity/Schwab directly make their money, it’s from sitting cash in your account and services they provide."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Sadly, no. The major allure for RH is the app itself - it's simple and easy to use. Other brokerages really need to step up their app game if they really want to take RH customers."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I also swapped over to Fidelity and absolutely hate the app.  The Active Trader Pro desktop add on isn't too bad, but nothing is as straight forward as Robinhood."
03/18/2021,stocks,"in this exact same boat.  opened Fidelity account during GME's first pop and absolutely hate the app.  would love to move my stocks somewhere out of RH, but haven't seen anyone offer a UI anywhere close to being as user-friendly."
03/18/2021,stocks,I have fidelity on android and it absolutely is user friendly.
03/18/2021,stocks,Webull is pretty close but still requires a few more clicks once you're in the app. I like their desktop client a lot but I'm not a day trader. You can go on their website and check out their [demo](https://app.webull.com/trade?source=seo-direct-home) before making an account.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Fidelity just updated their Spire app to include trading. It is similar to RH but is still a work in progress - no limit orders, no options, no total account value graph etc.  It does make it easier to look at your positions and total gain/loss than the Fidelity app."
03/18/2021,stocks,"lol this is me rn.  All my new deposits go to my Fidelity account, while I browse on Robin Hood and tend to the few positions I still have there."
03/18/2021,stocks,I wish so much this would happen. Fidelity is just so painfully slow as well. It’s definitely an older application but like others have said I’ll never forget what happened during GME
03/18/2021,stocks,You can now place trades on fidelity spire. I think it is going to replace their regular mobile app. They still have quite a bit of work to do.
03/18/2021,stocks,They're working on it. Their Fidelity Spire app is improving as we speak. Vanguard is also working on a brand new app called Vanguard Beacon. Sooner or later these big brokerages will be able to somewhat compete with Robinhood UI wise!
03/18/2021,stocks,Yes! Can someone advise on any brokerages that have decent UI and reasonable margin rates? I’m going to look at IB today and see if it’s worth transferring. Margin rates at IB are similar to RH.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Although I certainly wouldn't want a fidelity app to inherit all the fearures. The app is literally run like one  of those gambling phone apps; constant notifications, virtual scratch off ticket with every free stock, the whole layout changing colour during red days. Almost everything about that app was encouraging you to trade frequently and with your emotions. Its almost like they tried to make your portfolio tank lol"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I love fidelity and use it, but it's not the prettiest looking thing out there."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I actually like it.  It's probably silly, but I kind of like that the app is a little clunky and boring white-gray ""business chic"".  The app being straight-laced and non-flashy gives me a comfortable feeling of ""yeah, these guys have been around forever and will provide me with a fair and safe trading environment.""

Like I said, that's probably really stupid, but it's the feeling I get from it lol"
03/18/2021,stocks,I think they are. Fidelity has an app called spire. I have not checked them out personally yet. I use the mobile app and ATP. I like both of them.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I saw some video reviews about vanguard.. i was like, there is no way a $6 trillion company is this behind in the push towards getting in the mobile platform. 

Im leanings towards schwab or fidelity.

M1 finance ui and ease of use is top notch but i feel i have to transfer to a platform backed by a financial giant."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I wanted this too at first, but after using Fidelity for a while now I've realized RH sacrifices information and usability for design and aesthetic. The data presented on Fidelity is far more informative and it's also easier to track pending orders whereas RH uses a weird messaging system to cancel things things limit sells."
03/18/2021,stocks,Did you sell everything and then just re-buy it at Fidelity or did you transfer everything over for a fee?
03/18/2021,stocks,Well played sir
03/18/2021,stocks,I did the same thing in 2019 before it became cool.
03/18/2021,stocks,Preach
03/18/2021,stocks,"Even if this were the case, for the average user you’re probably losing pennies per trade with PFOF. But somehow paying $5 per trade is better?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Check the financials on a Schwab or fidelity.  They make money from services and the cash you leave in a brokerage account.  For services, you opt into them and making money off your cash is a lot less invasive.  You are still the customer."
03/18/2021,stocks,The minute RH fails we all go back to paying $8 a trade.
03/18/2021,stocks,As a small money beginner why should I care about order flow?
03/18/2021,stocks,"IIRC, RH does not publish their rate for order flow, while other brokerages normally disclose it. So you can be paying a fraction of a penny more on orders than if you were trading with any other brokerage that does commission free trading and not even know it. Sure it’s not even anything of value when you make a low volume order but for options trading and high volume orders, it can add up."
03/18/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/18/2021,stocks,Fidelity does not sell order flow. I believe it's the only major broker left that doesn't.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I would've said this but I was afraid of being downvoted.

Granted there are other reasons to not choose Robinhood. The biggest to me is that feels like amateur hour investing lol. They do a lot of hand-holding that I think more seasoned investors won't want or care for. Plus companies like Fidelity or AmeriTrade just have more services. I intend to swap to Fidelity once I get serious."
03/18/2021,stocks,"All ""commission free"" brokers are hiding their commissions behind their spread. Whenever you're opening a position, calculate how much you would lose if you closed it on the spot. That's a commission."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Was already accused of being a fidelity marketer, so left out the recommendation in the OP.  Just go with the biggest brokers."
03/18/2021,stocks,"That vids too short, I needed to see his reaction lol thats gold.

But seriously though, let's be realistic here, what's the actual risk of keeping my money with robinhood rn? Asking because idk. Is it that they're gonna go bankrupt or somehow be charged with illegal shit and I won't be able to withdraw or transfer my funds if shit actually hits the fan? Everyones talking shit but I wana know the realistic chain of events that will lead to total loss of of my money and why I won't have any time at all to react ? 

I don't mind switching to something like fidelity later, but I'm staying for now because i don't wana miss a potential sell opportunity with gme on the off chance something happens within a couple days."
03/18/2021,stocks,And Reddit..... wait a second.
03/18/2021,stocks,people still use google?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Way ahead of you there, did that a long time ago."
03/18/2021,stocks,Think you missed the point here
03/18/2021,stocks,Which year? I heard this before and they said they filed taxes only for it to be wrong and got an amended 1099 and had to refile so their suggestion was to wait a little to file
03/18/2021,stocks,What mistake did they make?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Before RH, these brokerages were charging fees out of the wazoo. RH, like them or not, broke that model and made it simple for normal folks like me to access with smaller initial trades.

As I if Fidelity or TD Ameritrade ever gave a shit about my interests, either. Yes, RH sucks, but they changed the game."
03/18/2021,stocks,"It's the kids who tossed all their money in GME at $250 weeks ago being upset.

I expect this from WallStreetBets, but I guess it bleeds over here as well."
03/18/2021,stocks,Yeah its kind of ridiculous I can't use a brokerage without some snob telling me how bad I am as if any corporation really cares about us.
03/18/2021,stocks,"And they're fucking constantly spammed. Like bro I get it, Robinhood bad, knew that about 50 posts ago..."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I like the bullets about shit he’s never used before in RH.  Every no-fee broker as well as many fee-based brokers are selling your order flow, Robinhood is not special in that way.  If you’re going to make a review about them at least make it comprehensive and knowledgeable.  This post is just stupid circlejerk trash

**Why you really shouldn’t use Robinhood:**

Mickey Mouse fucking charts that have never been improved, it’s like the fisher price of trading apps

Non-existent support

They fuck up people’s tax forms on a regular basis then give you a revised version sometimes after you’ve already filed your taxes

The app STILL chokes and crashes on high volume days and has done so since the beginning, you would think they’d have figured that out by now after almost 8 fucking years in the business"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Mentioned this already, it’s not about feelings, it’s in the financials.

Look at the financials of a fidelity or Schwab. They make money off of their paid services and cash in your brokerage account.  In both those situations, you are the actual customer."
03/18/2021,stocks,This. RH revolutionized investing and all the ungrateful bastards are spitting in their faces now because they didn't let them buy a meme stock at some point. Just pathetic.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Found Vlad, and he big mad."
03/18/2021,stocks,Check out the lawsuits against Robinhood in regards to GME. With Robinhood you also don't actually purchase crypto they loan it to you. Robinhood is known to stop the little man from making too much money. Stat away from robinhood
03/18/2021,stocks,Yeah I read the post and still don't understand why I wouldn't use robinhood.  If not robinhood then what free stock trading app should I use and how would it be better?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yes, use what works for you, but understand where you are on the food chain and how the business model works."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You’re not in the same boat. No one pays for trades now.  

Fidelity does not take PFOF.  They make money off their services and cash in your account, check their financial. This business model is different from a RH.  At least with a fidelity, you are still the actual customer"
03/18/2021,stocks,"It took me 2 months to get approval at fidelity. Webull enabled it in 2 days. The transfer times were ridiculous at Webull. At RH, I enabled options at the click of a button. I switched to RH gold, and instant transfers.  

I have my concerns with RH, and it is a secondary broker for me. But, RH made trading amazingly convenient. I hope they can sort out their flow issues."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Let’s unpack this: if a brokerage has not given you the privilege to trade options, it’s likely for a good reason.  It sucks, but I wouldn’t want to invest with a company that gave everyone this privilege Willy nilly."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I have heard this before.  If you got time, why is it better than other brokerages?"
03/18/2021,stocks,TD
03/18/2021,stocks,"I don’t use any of my brokers for research, I just just yahoo finance to look at all my stocks and other tickers.  Yea, their interface sucks."
03/18/2021,stocks,“Because it’s bland” sure is a dumb reason to possibly get fucked for thousands of unrealized gains... But whatever floats your boat. It ain’t my money... lol
03/18/2021,stocks,Nice to know you care more about aesthetics of an app than your money
03/18/2021,stocks,"If you want an interface that’s nice and not RH Sofi is pretty good, I use it for some long terms but they don’t offer the OTCs that fidelity does."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Again, missed the point.  I’m a full fledged capitalist. Their users/customers, are the ones that pay for order flow, not retail investors.  This dynamic of who the real customer is, effects your experience and how you are treated.

Since you don’t have big money with them, it doesn’t really matter."
03/18/2021,stocks,I transferred out to Schwab. They reimbursed the $75 transfer fee after I asked support so that was nice. I am still waiting for my cost basis to appear though. It's been several weeks and I didn't really document it anywhere.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Thanks.

Go into a 10k and parse out how much net revenue is made from order flow from a Schwab or fidelity.  Ex. schwab, it’s 6%, up from 1% since  the TD acquisition.  Volume matters, this is not the main driver of revenue, meaning, it’s not a significant customer.

IRA, got me.

Other than that, I just hear a lot of noise from you.  I’m a buy and hold investor. I put my money into business models that make sense to me me as an investor/ as a customer."
03/18/2021,stocks,No thanks.
03/18/2021,stocks,More like we are the fishermen as well but RH let's us use the big boats of Citadel to catch some fish for free.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Honestly if you are abouy dividend investment and not chasing meme stocks, RH is actually an easy and user friendly app. The only ones scared of RH are the ones gambling on meme stock worrying they won't be able to cash out their gamble or somehow RH would screw the game.


I like RH for the ease of providing me the greeks and the probability when making CCs and CSPs. If you are a conservative investor, you don't need to be scared."
03/18/2021,stocks,Youre not buying Coinbase or Stariink on IPO day?
03/18/2021,stocks,"So far all the IPOs we've seen recently (Bumble, Oscar Health, Coupang, etc.) is a never buy at open type of situation. The only exception was Roblox which was a direct listing and quite frankly did really well."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You missed my point. It was an example to explain the concept.  And I also mentioned, you have skin in the game (your money) in the case of Robinhood. 

Fidelity does not use PFOF."
03/18/2021,stocks,A LOT of ppl still use RH. It will be fine. Humans have short term memory.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Weak take. 

Waited two wks for customer service at RH to reply to my issue. They finally got back to me with some generic copy-pasted bull shit reply, and didn’t address a single one of my issues. 

Called them out on it, and two weeks later they finally replied with the exact same copy-pasted message. 

Switched to TD Ameritrade, and after two days they personally called me to see if I was happy with the platform, and to let me know they were always available if I needed help/advice. 

Fuck Robinhood. All brokerages are not the same."
03/18/2021,stocks,Only reason I even use Etrade is I signed up in 2010 and it just wound up becoming a successful portfolio.
03/18/2021,stocks,"That’s a little too much.  I’m pretty sure it’s just normal people using RH.  This post is not an attack on their users, it’s on the company itself."

First movers in a market are great, they change the name of the game, but it doesn’t mean they should still exist or “honor” what they have done.

They gave us zero fee commissions.  Thank you.  But that’s all they should get if they do change to being more customer centric in their model."
03/18/2021,stocks,"TD Ameritrade app is just as easy if not easier to use the RH. 24/7 customer service, local offices etc.... RH on the other hand, no customer service whatsoever....."

03/18/2021,stocks,Fidelity. It's slow to start & the stock price is a little slow but you can use an app like WeBull just to track stocks & switch over to Fidelity
03/18/2021,stocks,All brokerages should have a transfer option. You should be able to transfer all securities to a different account. There is usually a cost involved though.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Fidelity's UI is like something from the early 2000s, but they have size and mostly free trades.  I think there are fees for certain options, but regular share purchases are free.  The only fee's I've paid were charged at $0.01/$1,000 in volume.  Since those sells were to lock in significant profit, that was a tiny percentage of the earnings paid in fees."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You missed the point.  If you are not customer (retail investor) specific in your business model, you will always get the shorter end of the stick and everything will drive for high usage/ high payout, rather than customer lifetime value.

It doesn’t matter if the ceo cares about me or not.  But if he/she knows their primary source of revenue is directly from retail investors, then the type of products offered (IRA, 401k, wealth management) change, rather than making a UI that increases your risk factor of losing an infinite amount of money."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Me too, I'm not sure what they require for level 2+ options."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Anyone that is customer centric in their business model. You can take your pick, but folks seem to think they need a one stop shop. I use fidelity just to buy, but I spend most of my time on yahoo finance to look at my portfolio and do research."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yes... it is ridiculous. Point is that they develop apps first, then trading/investing second. The disparity between the two causes these infra failures."
03/18/2021,stocks,You?  Maybe.
03/18/2021,stocks,What’s your definition of accessible?  Anyone can sign up for a Schwab or fidelity account
03/18/2021,stocks,"No, at all of them"
03/18/2021,stocks,They got some advantages.  I see them being an acquisition potentially.
03/18/2021,stocks,A fidelity or Schwab type
03/18/2021,stocks,For sure.  Legacy IT team and thinking on that side.  I just use the broker app to buy and yahoo finance for everything else.
03/18/2021,stocks,"You should be able to do a transfer in kind.  Only issue is that there will be an limbo period.  If you’re worried about it, just start new positions in your new broker and wait for a better time."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yes.  Depends on the broker, but you can often initiate online.  Don’t sell your stocks"
03/18/2021,stocks,"> There are so many brokers with free trades it literally makes no sense to use RH.

Which no one seems to be able to name. If there are decent brokerages with free trades on single stock shares, please share them."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I had the same fears of moving platforms. However, consider this:

1) the longer you stay, the greater your fear will grow
2) you don’t have to transfer all at once. Do it in increments if you’re worried about being frozen.
3) every day trading with the “bad” platforms is another day helping the the ones trying to crush you ."
03/18/2021,stocks,Signed
03/18/2021,stocks,"When you transferred out of robinhood, how did they take your $75 transfer fee? Did they take it out of your bank account connected to robinhood? Or did they take it from your portfolio?"
03/18/2021,stocks,Transfer in kind.  You don’t need to sell and shouldn’t just to switch.
03/18/2021,stocks,"They got bought by Schwab.  Scanned the 10k.

There is actually a bump in order flow revenue after the acquisition, which makes sense, but it accounts for about 6% of net revenue.  Not too significant yet, if anything, it allows the TD business to be less reliant on order flow"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Heh, not alumni at all.  Only meant to explain the business model for the un-initiated."
03/18/2021,stocks,Point taken for sure.  It was meant to mainly highlight that they aren’t equities experts.
03/18/2021,stocks,You can transfer your entire account to Webull and until the end of the month they will cover the transfer fee.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Where are the assumptions?

Just go into a 10k for Schwab or fidelity.  The answer is there.  

If companies align to a consumer centric model, they, then their wealth comes from consumers."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Good point.

This goes back to the concept of who is the actual customer.  If you wanted a lifetime customer, would you make it simply easier for them to spend money or would you want to educate them, and help them nurture a huge net worth?"
03/18/2021,stocks,It's going to take months to recover from 75$??? Do you have like 50$ in trading?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Because their options layout is great. Not because the act of trading options is easy, it’s their layout. I have Schwab, fidelity, webull and firstrade, and their options layout is awful."
03/18/2021,stocks,Don't overlook ETFS
03/18/2021,stocks,M1
03/18/2021,stocks,"A couple of days, also you have to pay a $75 fee to robinhood for the transfer. Unless you'd pay more in taxes by selling, just sell and do bank transfer."
03/18/2021,stocks,You would be better off selling your RH assets and doing a bank transfer
03/18/2021,stocks,"They did stop trades though. Went into non-scheduled ""scheduled maintenance"" during the peak of the hype. They also limited margin and extended settle times on GME/AMC.. they were doing their part.. trust me. Why I switched."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Has the cash you're trying to withdraw been recently deposited or from a recent selling of stocks? It may be held up until everything settles. If not, then that's fucked."
03/18/2021,stocks,Contact the SEC and file a complaint and they will get back to you very quickly
03/18/2021,stocks,"Transferring from a brokerage usually takes way longer than a typical bank does. One of the reasons you shouldn't use a brokerage account for your emergency fund.

Clearing times can sometimes take longer than expected and with everyone seemingly running for the exits with Robinhood there are bound to be issues. I'd wager there is a ton of damage control going on behind the scenes over there.

Guess that's why you shouldn't hand out margin like candy to high credit risk individuals who have no idea what they're doing with other people's money. Most folks probably don't even realize that when you trade on margin that it isn't actually your money.

Robinhood made a bad call and a lot of bad decisions, but they brought the consequences on themselves. They have to live with those now."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I’m experiencing the same. I closed two small positions three days ago, yet none of my money is available for transfer back to my bank."
03/18/2021,stocks,Dude there was a guy on here who got his RH card stolen. Thieves drained his account. Nobody to contact for the fraud charges.
03/18/2021,stocks,Are you fucking kidding me
03/18/2021,stocks,oof
03/18/2021,stocks,Source on this? Sounds crazy
03/18/2021,stocks,"Just FYI if in a situation like this kid was in, killing yourself doesn’t erase the debt (in the event it wasn’t a mistake). The company you owe isn’t going to cut their losses and say “oh well he’s dead now so I guess we’re fucked!”  They will instead go after your next of kin, beneficiary, family member closest to you (not emotionally but relatively). So that family member will then not only have to deal with your death but also, now, your debt.  That is a horrible thing to do to a person 

So that being said, if you’re ever unlucky enough to find yourself In a situation like this, try to resolve it first and never choose suicide. It’s just money"
03/18/2021,stocks,[removed]
03/18/2021,stocks,"Ok, RH's cutomer service is awful, but enough of this ""If Robinhood wasn't trash, he'd still be alive"" crap. People's individual problems are a combination of factors. I'm not defending RH, but I think it's incredibly disrespectful to the deceased person to blame their suicide on a company.  It's invalidating their life problems and that kind of mentality is toxic for people seeking help for the same reason."
03/18/2021,stocks,"+ $GME was just another *one* for RHs running track record... I had [this reminder](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinhoodOptions/comments/fcj49j/i_just_lost_all_of_my_money_because_the_system/fjbh84r?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) pop up the other week from last February. Most DEFINITELY the worst issue to date.

 I'm in the process of getting the last of my positions out of there I have some long options that I'm not closing yet but I'm done when I do!  

When they stopped the RobinTrack website it was quite clear that they knew the ""not really a secret, secret,"" was out and people were waking up a little more.

Happy hunting out there @ all, Steve Frosty

e: link fix"
03/18/2021,stocks,So where do you put your money?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Also never forget the bullshit mass email they sent out trying to explain what happened that day. Blatant lies saying that they were PROTECTING us retarded retail investors from losing too much money. Gee, thanks RH."
03/18/2021,stocks,If so could this not be manipulated to make charts that include volume data seem extremely volatile and put investors off even if the orders are all fractional shares from >$1000  accounts?
03/18/2021,stocks,I can't believe that RH stopped trading in GME because they didn't have enough billions to put up as collateral on the trades. Why didn't they just break US law and serve their customers the ability to buy the highly inflated stock that was almost guaranteed to lose them money... Smh
03/18/2021,stocks,"People say that, Interactive broker shut down GME too though. Also, they carved a path for commission free trading. I use multiple different brokerages. Either IB, RH, MT4, some others Ive used. They do not vary as much as I believe people say they do. 
The cons of RH get overinflated. Most people don't brag about thier brokerage. 
In addition to all of this... Many people criticing them, are investors, not traders. Investors may make a few orders a year, a swing trader may make a few a week, a day trader may make a few a day. If your day trading your brokerage will certainly matter, swing trading it will be a bit of a factor, in investing its mostly a moot point to me. Unless you want a lot of contingency options on your orders and the like. 

RH isnt perfect by any means, but its really not the monster people make it out as... 

If your a good trader your brokerage wont make or break you. Dually true for investors. 

Focusing on your trades, and trading strategies will take you further than brokerage evaluations."
03/18/2021,stocks,THIS. and not to mention Robinhood’s high order-flow revenues and how they charged principal trading firms [much more than the going rate.](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1015686/robinhood-was-indeed-too-good-to-be-true) It is just not worth it to get involved.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Oh thats really good to know, this is the first year that I have to claim my gains and I use schwab"
03/18/2021,stocks,I use mainly TD Ameritrade
03/18/2021,stocks,Charles Schwab
03/18/2021,stocks,Thats KYC . Every bank will ask you to give them shit ton of personal details.
03/18/2021,stocks,Am american and use Schwab. Desktop site leaves a little to be desired and I can't speak for the app but the mobile site is a good midpoint between a boomer broker and something like robinhood. They even have a live day trader style tracker you can download but I can't speak to its quality.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I never gave my ID to Webull.

I think Fidelity is exceptional and well trusted.

But I just tried Sofi ivesting app, very underrated, not bad for a simple UI and they offer fractionals and crypto.

both are commission free"
03/18/2021,stocks,"The drivers license is what made me stop the account. I like the interface of WeBull and use it for DD, but I'll never open an account with them being a Chinese entity."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I use Ally Invest. I've been with them a couple years and have a trade account along with an Roth IRA ETF and another higher-risk ETF. You can do self-directed trading, and if you're losing at that, invest in a managed (bot) fund, lol. Haven't seen this company mentioned much on here but works for me. Commission free, as are most nowadays."
03/18/2021,stocks,Fidelity is very solid. Would highly recommend
03/18/2021,stocks,I didn't need to provide a photo ID? Will they ask me in the future?
03/18/2021,stocks,"When it's customers vs product (us), they care about serving their customers over any regard for the product which they view doesn't know any better."
03/18/2021,stocks,I will take a company that is incentivized to care over a company that isn't any day of the week. A company that would lose something should I chose to take my business elsewhere is a company I want to do business with.
03/18/2021,stocks,"That may be true but their customer service is excellent! I have a service agent with an extension number that I can call and get a response immediately. It’s so refreshing. You can’t even speak with a human at RH, no phone number anywhere..."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah people can hate on RH all they want but RH is pushing other companies to finally change. Some of them had to also go comission free on trades so they didn't lose all their customers to RH. And now some companies like Vanguard are now working on apps such as ""Vanguard Beacon"" to be an easy to trade app like RH is. The current UI for Vanguard completely sucks, it's made for boomers who likes making phone calls for all their needs. My Roth IRA is with them because buying and holding is easy enough on their platform. But for actively trading it sucks. 

If it wasn't for RH I believe there weren't going to be much incentive for these big complacent companies to make any changes.

My Roth IRA is in Vanguard and my actively trading/options account is in RH until another big company like Vanguard can finally make an easy to trade on the go phone app with most of the information needed to trade all there. Because of this i am rooting for their new Vanguard Beacon app but I just hope they dont feel like they dont need to do that to keep their customers and give up on that project."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You talking about the TD app or their TOS platform app? Cuz the TD app is boomer af but their TOS platform, while being a little confusing for someone moving from RH, is pretty damn good."
03/18/2021,stocks,I have zero issues with TOS.  Works fine by me.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Companies need to have your interest at mind or they won’t be around long. 

See: RH"
03/18/2021,stocks,Imagine complaining about capitalism on a stocks subreddit
03/18/2021,stocks,I like E*TRADE also
03/18/2021,stocks,If the same people made the same trades at any other broker the same result would have occurred.
03/18/2021,stocks,If you’re a long term investor how can rh hurt you
03/18/2021,stocks,"This is the way. I wonder why you’re getting down voted? You are speaking truth, and protecting your money. 

I cashed out/ transferred to my fidelity account. I can’t wait for my shares to actually be bought and they can’t be used against me anymore. 


Rh is literally telling hedges what our positions are and then the hedges make money off of this by knowing your position and manipulating the market to screw you and benefit them."
03/18/2021,stocks,But their apps are soooo shitty
03/18/2021,stocks,"

03/18/2021,stocks,Gonna reactivate my account a few days before IPO and then deactivate again to help the cause.
03/18/2021,stocks,I’m in. Planned to do it anyway so might as well do it at a time where my voice has a chance of being heard.
03/18/2021,stocks,This is the way
03/18/2021,stocks,That's been my plan as well
03/18/2021,stocks,I like this idea. I transferred all my assets to Fidelity but the fractional shares remain. I'll wait and sell after they're public.
03/18/2021,stocks,Can't short it during the first 30 days of trading.
03/18/2021,stocks,Reverse yolo
03/18/2021,stocks,Buy it low ride it up then sell at the top take profit and plunder by shorting to its bottom👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹this is the way🚀🚀🚀💩💩💩💩💩
03/18/2021,stocks,"personally im buying calls on margin with robinhood and ill buy puts on my actual account.  from what im reading, theyll effectively short themselves with their own money and the puts will print."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Personally, I don't ever think it's a good idea to go against a company. It's you vs. millions of dollars of shares.

I'd place calls for the short term, and then a put in the long term. I bet their IPO is going to go down pretty hard."
03/18/2021,stocks,There is. It's called principles.
03/18/2021,stocks,Did you have any issues with cost basis not displaying correctly in Fidelity? I've heard that to be an issue and is definitely one of the things holding me back from jumping the ship immediately.
03/18/2021,stocks,I've been requesting level 2 for weeks and I'm still at level 1.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Did you have any issue with your stocks showing as ‘margin’ in fidelity? I did a partial transfer from robinhood to fidelity, only took 24 hours, but now my stock show as margin in fidelity. I never used margin in RH nor plan to use margin in fidelity. I didn’t apply or have it enabled in either. Any advice?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Did you have to do anything with the transfer of asset form that fidelity create when starting the transfer? I just see it sitting in tracking transfers

I started it last night and just waiting for RH to verify everything"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I did move it over. But only all my GME and all my AMC because partial account transfers (only a few stocks not the whole portfolio) take 48 hours instead of a week or more for the whole account.

 Not too worried about the boomer stocks for now. Ill transfer them too but they aren't likely to hit some astronomical number like GME & AMC"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yup. Very poor spokesperson, but Robinhood the brokerage did nothing wrong. The clearing houses were jammed up because of liquidity issues across the nation, and Robinhood created their own fledgling clearing house to get off Apex. It's the CH and securities juggernaut at the top requiring they up their collateral that screwed retail investors.

I personally don't think Vlad understood all of this, which itself is a problem. Robinhood should can him and bring in someone new before the IPO to reassure users and investors alike."
03/18/2021,stocks,No
03/18/2021,stocks,I lost all 300k paper trading where’s my medal?
03/18/2021,stocks,"1. I don’t plan on paper trading with more money than i’ll have in real life. I also plan to keep within my 2% risk margin like this book says.

2. I plan on getting at least 100-500 paper trades under my belt before going live.

Still not sure if I have a good plan. I literally only start to read about this stuff within the past week or so."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Fidelity’s mobile app isnt the best but they have always executed my market trades at eye-poppingly good prices in the spread, so they forever have my business, next to a long list of other reasons."
03/18/2021,stocks,Vanguard doesn’t charge any fees either but they also won’t let you buy a stock under a penny
03/18/2021,stocks,Just use the mobile version then. ToS is for advanced traders I think.
03/18/2021,stocks,Not trying to belittle you but you DID made sure to set the trading hours to extended right? ie GTC + EXT
03/18/2021,stocks,I trade pre- and post-market all the time with ToS. You sure you've got it set for limit-GTC-EXT?
03/18/2021,stocks,Are you using limit orders? Regular market orders don’t work pre/after hours.
03/18/2021,stocks,trying this with $SLV at 10¢ under the bid right now with no success
03/18/2021,stocks,"The only thing they could have done is had more money on hand, which they immediately did once it became an issue. Not really their fault though since it was the DTCC requirements that fucked them. Also not sure what you mean by “limitless trading”. As long as there’s requirements of the brokerage there necessarily will be limits at some point, we usually just don’t reach that point."
03/18/2021,stocks,"To me, it’s not even about what they could have or didn’t do, it’s that they chose to lie so really any reasoning on their end isn’t justifiable. I don’t need to be lied to to understand one makes a mistake. Picking yourself up is half the battle and they chose to shit on their base to save face. Even if everything was legally by the book, that’s inexcusable and unjustified."
03/18/2021,stocks,"If you're trading on margin and the security you're trading becomes too volatile/worthless, or they don't have the collateral to clear your trade with a clearing house, the answer is yes, every time, every brokerage, without fail."
03/18/2021,stocks,You absolutely should care where their money comes from. The way RH gets their money now puts you at a disadvantage. Their MM’s are trading ahead of you on your order info.
03/18/2021,stocks,Webull seems to be competitive in that sense. But they seem to have the same financial position as RH.
03/18/2021,stocks,Webull
03/18/2021,stocks,"It's not user hostile exactly, but going from RH to Fidelity is shocking. I mean I'm used to it now, but I was an RH guy for a long time and I remember making the change and being disappointed by the app (though not by the service and range of available products - fidelity has given me the tools to set my finances exactly how I want them). I regularly send feedback to fidelity telling them to make their app a little more modern."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I transferred to ETrade and they reimbursed the $75 fee that RH charged. Only gotcha is the cost basis comes a bit late. Transfer took 5 business days for me. Also, note down the cost basis from RH so you can trade on the new platform and for your own records."
03/18/2021,stocks,You transfer. No need to sell and buy back. There’s an online form you fill out. I started the transfer on 3/1 and it was completed 3/10 and 3/11.
03/18/2021,stocks,"They make money on the expense ratios for my mutual fund investments and $50 every time I accidentally buy some foreign stocks, god damn it."
03/18/2021,stocks,Pretty sure Schwab takes money for order flow. Fidelity is the only “free” trading platform among major brokers that doesn’t currently and insiders say it is probably less than a year out before they do as well.
03/18/2021,stocks,Every bank or financial institution in the world does this and has forever. I don't understand the you are the customer thing?
03/18/2021,stocks,Which is why I'm moving everything I have to schwab.
03/18/2021,stocks,I’m pretty certain that RH also makes money this way.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Well Ok yeah. that’s true. But let’s be real the whole reason brokers lowered their fees was because RH started to attract retail investors with their no commission and brokers had to follow because they would lose customers otherwise. I just want to point out how we got here. RH business model might be the future. Ok sure brokers can make money some other way. One way is to offer services customers might want to use. However, not everyone will use their other services. But if brokers get pfof then brokers will get paid."
03/18/2021,stocks,"They make money on margin debt, options, mutual funds, and servicing large accounts.

They have about half the CS people they need on the default phone number.

Edit: they also make a little money from [payment for order flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentoforderflow.asp) (note: the list at the bottom is not at all complete)"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Schwab's 100% sells order flows. Fidelity will soon as well when they realize it's inefficient for them to handle it on their own. The fact is, Citadel handles order flows for most of the biggest online brokerages. You should have researched it before spouting lies to these new investors who will just believe anything."
03/18/2021,stocks,"It's too late for that. The big brokerages already have changed to commission-free trading. For them to go back to their old model just because RH fails would be a stretch. If anything, the other brokerages' willingness to follow RH model could be seen as a contributing factor to RH's downfall."
03/18/2021,stocks,People can shit on Robinhood all they want but it was because of Robinhood that people can trade without commissions.
03/18/2021,stocks,Exactly
03/18/2021,stocks,"Provably incorrect. You can trade on any commission structure at IB and still use frac. shares, for example."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Really? Do you have a source? 

I’m not doubting you, I just thought they all did it."
03/18/2021,stocks,Why not to TD Ameritrade or Charles Schwab instead?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Thanks, just frustrated I can't get any useful info. I do appreciative the why's of RH sucks tho lol"
03/18/2021,stocks,There is no risk. The only illegal thing they could have done was to ignore DTCC requirements and continue allowing GME buys.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I don’t see any risk in keeping your equities with RH for now. But if you are actively trading using their platform, then you’re automatically on the losing end because you are their product that their selling to the MMs.

Ultimately, using their platform helps keep their business afloat. And while I don’t see any risk of keeping one’s account open for the time being, I would rather not help hem stay in business longer than necessary."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Don't read into the bullshit OP is saying. The only part where the RH CEO fucked up was when he said RH didn't have a liquidity issue when it was 100% the reason they had to shut down GME and other stocks. Other than that, the people hating on RH are simply ignorant folks who have no idea how trades are cleared and processed. 

You're covered for $500k in securities+cash and $250k in cash alone. I think RH has excess coverage so it might be even more of a coverage but it wouldn't affect 99.9% of people anyways. 

As for GME, the potential of collateral requirements increasing is definitely possible but RH has increased their capital so it's very unlikely that they will pause trading on it again."
03/18/2021,stocks,Everyone stop using Reddit. They don’t charge you so they don’t have your best interest in mind. Their real customer is all the companies that pay to have their ads featured.
03/18/2021,stocks,Duck duck go is where it's at.
03/18/2021,stocks,90% market share
03/18/2021,stocks,Lol I don’t think so. Not with all the posts I’ve been seeing lately pleading to stop using it. 😅
03/18/2021,stocks,This year. I am still waiting for it. I'm not filing until I get the revised one.
03/18/2021,stocks,They missed two large transaction - my big losses for the year. Instead of being in the negative for year they claim i'm positive. About 60k difference. Its absurd.
03/18/2021,stocks,Imagine these people trying to trade during the days of commissions.
03/18/2021,stocks,And it’s every other post or comment. All the stock subs started turning to shit ever since gme and (you know what sub) got shut down briefly
03/18/2021,stocks,I havent had those problems at all
03/18/2021,stocks,"Agree with all your points. 

Switched to Thinkorswim, and it’s amazing having MACD/RSI right there, the customer service is fantastic, and the whole experience feels so much less “plastic-y” than Robinhood. 

It actually feels like a platform for investing."
03/18/2021,stocks,"What if I don't care at all about ""being the product""?"
03/18/2021,stocks,How do they make money when you have cash in your account?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Youre the customer on all the sites

&#x200B;

If not, then what are you? A user? Visitor?"
03/18/2021,stocks,Lmao tbh tho RH is the main reason a bunch of investing sites and apps went commission free for the most part (like Fidelity who used to be $5 a trade not too long ago iirc).
03/18/2021,stocks,"Its every other post too. RobinHood Bad, Delete Robin Hood.

&#x200B;

We get it. And ffs stop spamming GME, keep it to a megathread"
03/18/2021,stocks,Children at this point. Never seen so much bitching in my life.
03/18/2021,stocks,This kind of thought process is really frightening. They did something good once so they can do no wrong now.   Yikes.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Those lawsuits aren’t going anywhere since what they did with gme was legal.
Its obvious that you dont own the crypto since is their is no wallet. 
Again, get yourself educated with thr gme situation"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Is there any proof every broker isn't selling your data somehow?

Edit: nevermind they are. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentoforderflow.asp"
03/18/2021,stocks,"This right here. Fidelity is far from ideal, but they *are* better. People keep conflating and oversimplifying brokerages' business models, and the truth gets lost in the sauce.

Robinhood was trash well before the recent incident, and for a lot more reasons than cherry-picked one-way trade halts."
03/18/2021,stocks,Why not? It's kinda ridiculous the sooner you have access the sooner you learn with less money at stake. But I guess  you want to be treated like a baby
03/18/2021,stocks,I don’t know what that reason would be.  It’s definitely not my income—to be Frank.  Could it be how little I’ve invested in buying shares with them? Previously used RH and haven’t transferred the funds to Ameritrade yet.
03/18/2021,stocks,"just use it to buy crypto or stocks or play with options. You will see how fast and intuitive it is. I would jump ship, but UI interface of fidelity and the number of times you have to click to do something is beyond frustration."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Again? First comment I've made here.

I agree you should know who the real customer is, but if you understand all that and choose to invest with them why does it matter? It's everyone's choice. 

True, if you have big money invested you probably shouldn't be using Robinhood. As I said most of my investments are through a bank with a full time advisor monitoring them."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Percentages are deceptive. If Schwab makes 100m from order flow and RH 200m but for Schwab that's 2% and for RH that is 20% you're being deceived on how good you have it. One way or the other you were the product and you will continue to be the product. Don't kid yourself that there's a moral high ground here when you're the sucker at both Poker tables.

Also, if you're a buy/hold investor RH and the transformation of zero fees has greatly helped you even if you don't use this particular feature very often. RH is definitely not at fault or any worse as a broker for you regardless because as a B/H investor you should have very little to no activity by which to need support!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yep. True that conservative investors need not be scared.

I don't understand why anyone needs to be scared. You are always in control of your money. You decide how much to put in, what to put it on, when to withdraw. Once you buy an asset you own it. They cannot snatch your money or control it directly at any step.

Also, whatever kind of investor you are, the risks are the same whether you invest it via RH or any other platform."

Dude, no one using RH should expect them to be customer friendly. They aren't a full service brokerage. They do the bare minimum because that's how they can allow you to trade for free."
03/18/2021,stocks,Thank you!
03/18/2021,stocks,Quick question; I know robinhood charges $75 for a transfer fee. Do you know if they take it from fidelity? Or should I have that $75 in my robinhood as cash?
03/18/2021,stocks,Thank you! Will crypto also transfer?
03/18/2021,stocks,Fidelity.
03/18/2021,stocks,I believe it was from cash I had freed up within Robinhood itself

03/18/2021,stocks,Do they have transfer fees?
03/18/2021,stocks,Doesnt fidelity reimburse the fee?
03/18/2021,stocks,That's true for most brokers. TD Ameritrade and TradeStation also charge a $75 fee for moving the stocks in the account. It's $0 if you sell the stocks and move the cash.
03/18/2021,stocks,Horrible advice
03/18/2021,stocks,"Maybe for you. Didn’t happen to me, especially with active trader pro.

Glad to have people leave fidelity though. Too many are joining."

03/18/2021,stocks,It's not even about paper trading with more money than you have in real life. It's all about emotion when it comes to dealing with hard earned money on the line. There's literally no emotion involved when you're paper trading and emotion will mess up whatever trading plan you got. I think it's even better to smart small with real money once you learned the basic from paper trading.
03/18/2021,stocks,The problem is emotional. Start with real money very small if you’re day trading. Slowly scale into more. When you add real money your mind play other tricks.

03/18/2021,stocks,"But the reason I bring up the matter is that it's apples to oranges. Schwab is A) much larger and B) offers many other products. 10Ks are useless if you're not thinking about what you're reading. Your entire premise is that you aren't the sucker at poker table A vs. B regarding order flow but you are. To try and shift it away and say, ""buy look at the other benefits"" makes you no less a sucker in that sense.

So while you don't consider it customer-centric you have to remember that your broker, probably one of the larger ones, *sold order flow anyway* on you. Always. You being angry that RH is blatantly doing it instead of doing it under the rug makes no sense. The original model, were to study it, is about customer-centric as Robinhood is today in your viewpoint; other than a call center and a lot of keeping you happily drugged from paying attention to the myriad of nasty hidden fees this is not a place where there was a free lunch. 

The only reason, and literally the *only* reason, that Schwab cares about how happy you are is so that you can keep being a series of revenue streams. I'm not against these companies but Fidelity makes more money off of you just having an IRA, that's it, doing nothing with it, than RH or WB or any of the other ""tech"" companies do with you making trades every day. Payment for order flow is nowhere near as lucrative as account fees. I'm just saying that you're stating a lot of things that are either outright false and underdeveloped or just skewed to a point of vilification but not particularly true of the industry or it's constituents.

Whether Fidelity is a ""good broker"" is a different question.

03/18/2021,stocks,"You can. But it's a lot harder to do. This is something that your average Redditor who makes shit up about not offering IRAs being meaningful is not going to do very well.

For instance let's take a small trip into history: 

In the past you had to literally call your broker. On a phone. A lot of these advances in technology moved you away from this but the infrastructure in the older companies was still there so it just simply turned into the customer service segment it is today; it is completely erroneous to think that Fidelity ""built"" this ""for you"". They didn't. They had nowhere for this stuff to go and it just kind of worked itself out.

And that's what I mean by having to compare these things; when people say that the CS is weaker than a 75-year-old seen-everything owned-everything company that has it's fingers in every possible pie (Fidelity FYI) that's a given. To say that the practice of selling order flow or anything else is immoral is fine, totally cool with that, but to argue that Fidelity is better on the basis that they let you run deep into their trenches so they can take your money is insane. Even Fidelity's financial services aren't free. Nothing is free in that model. In fact it used to cost more. 

It's just interesting to read people rag on one thing or another when in fact the biggest puppeteers and overseers are being worshipped. Fidelity is fucking you and if you don't know it then they certainly aren't going to ruin their own fun and tell you. I mean the number of SEC cases against them that have been just forgotten is pretty staggering. Likewise the other large older firms before technology allowed more instantaneous investing. 

It's probably closer to apples to combat helicopters the more I think about it."

03/18/2021,stocks,"I mean that’s true, definitely so, but the thing with giving robinhood the hate is nearly all other retail brokers did the same thing. There were a couple who managed fine, but it’s just almost like the flip side. Getting your orders filled doesn’t matter as much when you’re not sure if the price is actually current, or if you need to triple check what you’re seeing on various other sites. 

That’s my biggest issue with them. They’re totally great for buy and hold strategies where short term timing and price isn’t as much of an issue. But it’s not really all that intuitive for anything short term. Needing to turn on live price updates is about as boomer as something can get. 

Really besides the gme fiasco, I’ve had no issues when it’s came to orders getting filled other than other than on very hyped plays where the same issue generally occurred across all brokers. Most of them have came out cheaper than what I see when I hit buy.  But I’m not really pissed though that they limit gme, my biggest issue was the lies surrounding it. It doesn’t really matter where I’d been, any broker I’d considered at the time would have done the same thing. But not every broker wiped their ass with their clients."

Except a better interface does add to end product. I mean, you don’t know what your paying without live updates. You can’t get a feel for anything with the most basic of buy and hold charts. Trading is much more than just holding the product."

03/18/2021,stocks,"They are using Fidelity spire as a testing ground right now
Why we bowl over something like interactive brokers"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Ah, okay. I stand corrected"
03/18/2021,stocks,"No, the point of that is that I can’t just place the blame on them. As of January 27, I had no intentions of using any of those “legit” brokers. It wouldn’t have mattered where I went before then, anywhere I would have considered would have gave me the same loss. It doesn’t really matter if I lose it here or there, the loss is all the same. 

That’s why I can’t just place the blame on robinhood. If robinhood wouldn’t have been the go to broker of young retail, and degenerates, it would have been some other non boomer broker. 

People should be in jail, but really what can you do. These laws aren’t made to protect us or do anything but exploit us. I’m not entirely sure how any broker would be paying this out if it was left unhindered and got to run till it’s heart content. 

I’m not saying it’s worth it to keep, but it’s good to keep in mind that most of us would have been fucked regardless. If fidelity, td, vanguard, were appealing before the squeeze, they wouldn’t have been on robinhood in the first place. 

But going forward, that’s something the industry needs to keep in mind and the first old school broker to make an app that targets our type of traders would be a smash. Once my margins paid, I’m out, I can’t wait for it, but I’m also not thrilled about the change either. I feel like I’m ditching a 911 turbo that runs 1/2 the time for a tank of a 99 Corolla. Sure it may be more reliable as that is the most essential part so I’m not arguing against your point exactly, but it’s pretty understandable to not be looking forward to it."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah the bare minimum to work. Just as the mechanics going to do the bare minimum, what you pay for. 

I wouldn’t agree that making it sleek is simply marketing. And if it were so, that goes to prove the point that boomer brokers aren’t marketing to anyone who’s not a boomer. Yippy, they provide a “interface” in 2021, it just hasn’t been updated since before the dot com crash. 

I can make my brass plumbing pieces all day, but making them nice, is part of my job. It’s not about just working, just doing the minimum. I take pride in what I do and it shows. People like it when it’s nice, they want it nice, and that’s what they get. Nobodies going to choose a working tarnished turd over a nice polished piece when they effectively do the same thing. 

If all that’s marketing, than these brokers need to take a course in it. It’s part of the reason we’re one of the top manufacturers, and why Apple is one of the most sought after tech products. Nobody wanted to switch until push came to shove, and we all knew of these brokers before the new age ones, so what’s that say about their product, and marketing? People are begging for a nice interface, and when that happens, people will switch because it’s better. They’re not sacrificing one aspect to protect another."
03/18/2021,stocks,And GME wasn’t their first violation. This is a pattern.

They have an income source it's just not set up to generate large profits. Not sure how people.dont understand this. Vanguard is pretty famous for this approach and it's why they became so large and are one of the primary brokers for long term investment holdings like retirement accounts."

2021-03-18 07:45:24,stocks,"How does Ray Dalio's All Weather Portfolio reconcile with his latest views on Bonds? First of all, apologies if this is not the appropriate subreddit for this as this is not strictly related to individual stocks. I don't think I'm breaking any rules but I'm relatively new here so would appreciate any guidance.

With that out of the way, I wanted to get the hive mind's thoughts on Ray Dalio's All Weather Portfolio. For those not aware, the portfolio comprises of 40% long term bonds, 15% intermediate bonds, 30% stocks, 7.5% gold and 7.5% commodities. The idea is that it is 'all-weather' and can help preserve and grow your portfolio regardless of the economic cycle. You're of course not going to make the same returns as a 100% total stocks portfolio in a bull market, but the goals here is to grow your assets with least volatility.

This strategy is well established, well espoused and is rigorously back-tested. However, there have been recent posts from Bridgewater indicating there's no point in holding bonds. E.g. - [https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/why-in-the-world-would-you-own-bonds-when](https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/why-in-the-world-would-you-own-bonds-when)

Ray Dalio himself has come on CNBC and claimed that it's pointless holding bonds - I can't find an exactly link right now for his interview. This has me really confused. Given the all weather portfolio is 55% bonds, and Dalio and Bridgewater are now claiming that bonds are useless, then what goes into the All Weather portfolio in their place? 

I've invested quite a bit of money per this strategy and the recent bonds sell off coupled with the above statements have me concerned. I'm hoping someone smarter than me that has looked into this can help enlighten me!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I would think this has something to do with the Fed’s manipulation of the yield curve using bonds to achieve desired results. We’re gonna need back up...any Ms/phds in the house tonight?

Also I would think that really your allocation of percentages of stocks vs bonds would be more closely correlated with your appetite for risk or lack thereof...

Edit: I went to public school and hooked on phonics did not work for me."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I use the strategy too. But I alter it. I hold SLV instead of commodities. I adjusted to 40% VTI instead of 30% and due to those simple changes it has done better. I rebalanced at the bottom literally waited for 30% drop. Just got lucky. I still think bonds are fine. Just would buy less of them. Bonds in my eyes are solely for rebalancing a portfolio, or for stable short term interest."
03/18/2021,stocks,"First, the All Weather fund is passively managed, so they won’t change the allocations just because Dalio thinks bonds are going to go down soon.

Second, the All Weather Fund is far more complicated than a fixed % allocation. They use a strategy called risk parity which makes extensive use of leverage. This involves using leverage to buy bonds. The fund also has an inflation adjusted bonds component (TIPS, presumably).

There are publicly available funds that try to replicate the All Weather strategy, but when I looked at them their performance was poor. And no, nobody here is replicating that strategy. Trying to replicate it involves leverage: Wealthfront uses [total return swaps](https://research.wealthfront.com/whitepapers/risk-parity/), futures are perhaps another way to do it. Options or simply borrowing on margin are going to be too expensive.

If you just try to match the stated asset allocation %'s without leverage, you will drastically underperform the All Weather Fund."

03/18/2021,stocks,"I dont' know anything about bond, so don't take my word for it.  

I think the issue is fundamental changed.  Meaning bond yield keep going down, it's at a point  you may want to think alternate asset to hold."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Thanks. I had also tweaked it a bit and wasn't holding the exact percentages but was still \~40% in bonds. With the bonds selloff in the market, my portfolio is out of whack and to rebalance it, I'll need to sell stocks and buy more bonds which seems totally counterintuitive to how the market is performing and Dalio's own statements."
03/18/2021,stocks,"did you read the analysis of Ray? How do you find bonds are fine when you only get your capital after 100 years and it doesn't even follow inflation? This is the textbook version of a bubble where you hold something with the thought that you can resell it later, you can't hold it for its value at face value."
2021-03-18 07:21:00,stocks,"Wash trading confusion If you sell a security for let's say 50,000 profit. 

You wait a day or two and rebuy the same exact security, but oh no, it starts dipping and your down to 45,000. So you freak out and sell for a 5k loss. 

Do you still owe cap. gains on the full 50k, or just the 45k you have now? 

Sorry I'm just confused how this works, all I'm reading about is wash only applies when you lose, but then the 30 day rule confuses me again. Thanks in advance."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I am a newb, so just to confirm if I understand the wash rule correctly, it only applies when you sell at a loss and then rebuy the same or “similar” stock within the next 30 days and then your losses are added on to your rebuy. Correct? Or am I missing something? Any help is appreciated."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You’re still up 45,000 in profits."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You’re up 45k, so owe cap gains on the 45.  However, now if you rebuy the same stock again and make another loss of 5k, your first 5k loss will no longer count against your cap gains...  so the irs will charge you for the gain on the 45k even though you actually only gained 40k in the end (50k-5k-5k =40k). But the irs sees 50k-5k-5k=40k+5k(penalty)=45k gain

Does that make sense?"
03/18/2021,stocks,Correct. Your losses are added to the rebuy.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Negative. Your cost basis changes by the amount of the disallowed gain on the next buy. 

You have to think of everything in cost basis. 

The examples are all wrong because it doesn't have an initial cost basis. Start over:

Step 1) You sell 1 share of a stock for $150 with a cost basis of $100. Realized gain $50.

Step 2) You buy the same ticker @$151 and sell @ $146 with a cost basis of  $151. Realized loss is $5. If you stop here, then at tax time, you are taxed on $45 net capital gain ($50, above, minus this $5).

Step 3) You then buy the same ticker @ $125.  Your $5 loss from above is disallowed as a wash sale. If you stop here, then your tax bill for *this year* is on $50 net capital gain ($50 realized gain from step 1, loss from step 2 disallowed). This feels like you are getting robbed because you only realized $45 in gain, but are paying on $50

HOWEVER, now STEP 4) The share you hold has a cost basis of $130, even though you only paid $125 for it. In other words, the share you hold already has your $5 loss built into the price. You then sell the share for $123. Instead of realizing $2 of loss, you realize $7 of loss. If you sell in the same year (and do not re-buy within 31 days), then your taxes are not affected. You show +$50, then 0 disallowed loss, then -$7 for total bill of $43.

If you sold in separate years, then you show +$50 in year 1, then -$7 in year 2. Net effect is the same, you are just paying more tax in year 1 and less in year 2.

The wash sale rule has lots of implications, but it's not a ""penalty."" You don't ever pay taxes on more than you make--tax rules simply won't allow for it.

The wash sale rule was designed to keep people from gaming the system by recording losses earlier than they realized them. For example if you took a loss on VOO today, but bought SPY on the same day, then the IRS just treats it as if you held the one position the entire time, instead of trying to record losses on VOO when your position in SPY is essentially the same and you really didn't book a loss."
03/18/2021,stocks,That was awesome!  Thanks!!!
03/18/2021,stocks,"Thank you for this. Somewhat clearer now but still not completely. I hope you don’t mind breaking down my scenario.

Bought 10 shares and paid $10/share (100 cost)
Sold 5 shares @$5/share ($25 loss)
Bought 10 shares @$2/share (wash sale triggered)
Sold all 15 shares for $12/share
All within 30 days. 

How does the wash sale apply to this? Would the loss($25) be added to the overall cost of the 15 shares and the difference is the profit that is taxed? 

Thank you."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Disclaimer: Not an accountant.

Assuming First In First Out tax lot accounting.

Step 1) 10 shares @ $10, $100 cost basis.

Step 2) Sold 5 shares @ $5. You have 5 @ $10 ($50 equity); $25 loss; $25 cash.

Step 3) Bought 10 shares @ $2. Wash sale triggered. You have 5 @ $10 basis each; 5 @ $7 basis each (2 purchase price + $5 increase in basis from disallowed loss); and $5 @ $2 basis each.

A) You sell all 15 shares in Year 1 for $12 each. You book $10 gain from the first lot of 5 shares ($12 sale, less $10 basis for $2 profit per share. You book $25 from the second lot of 5 ($12-$7=$5 per share). You book $50 from the last lot ($12-$2=$10 per share). Total taxable gain is $85.  

If you do the math, the Situation A should be the same with or without the wash tax rule because you sold all the shares in Year 1.  $10 profit + $100 profit - $25 loss = $85.

B) You sell 5 shares @ $12 in Year 1; then 10 shares @ 12 in Year 2. You book $10 gain in Year 1 (5 x $2 profit, your $25 loss is disallowed); then you book $75 in Year 2 ($25 profit from the first lot of cost adjusted 5, then a full $10 profit from each of the remaining unadjusted 5). 

Without the wash sale rule, you would have booked -$15 loss in year 1 (5 shares x $2 profit minus $25 loss from Step 2 above) and then $100 gain in year 2 (10 shares @ $10 profit each). Still $85 over the two years.

Ultimately, it’s all the same unless you you are trying to game the tax brackets or long term vs short term taxes."

I imagine a balanced e-commerce portfolio including current leaders and credible potential disrupters worldwide would do well in a couple years, largely a buy and forget affair.

Also a portfolio of payment processors, from classics like Visa and Mastercard to more recent fintech (PayPal and co.) to potential future disrupters (Apple, Google, Amazon) would be interesting. Probably would give me more jitters than the above though.
Visa and Mastercard should be a safe fire and forget at least.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 3/18: Why am I bullish?  Many of the reasons have already been stated in this [WSB thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6k8kv/plug_power_down_ah_buying_opportunity/).  However I will add in technical jargon the stock looks to be trying to put in a double bottom (a 'W' formation on a stock price chart).  So far anyway, it looks like it successfully tested it's March 5th low.  You might point out it already tried a double bottom and failed just recently and went lower.  I would point out the Nasdaq 100 went into correction territory on March the 5th (a 10% move down).  Many traders/investors look to come in when an index reaches correction territory - I'm hoping enough of these people will come in and take a shine to $PLUG.  But then again I could be wrong and we are headed lower (wouldn't be the first time).

As for the oodles of contempt I'm seeing for Mr. Cramer, I will start by pointing out my experience with him in a comment I made awhile back [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvvsc6/jim_cramer_is_out_for_blood/gpfua6j/?context=3).  I admit I may not know all his transgressions and will look over what many of you have to say.  However for now I'm hooked up to the Pollyanna side of my brain and falling back on my Catholic upbringing (it didn't totally take) and thinking he is a man on the road to redemption!  And has confessed many of his despicable hedgie ways.  If he is truly corrupt why has he been so open about some of what he has done?  Could he be someone trying to give away the hedgie playbook?  Hey, like I say right now I'm hooked up to the Pollyana side of my brain.

If I want to be contemptuous I save it for [this guy](https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&client=ubuntu&q=john+oliver+davita) (not John Oliver, the fellow he is talking about).  I'll just say my friends and I have had issues with this Thiry fellow over the years, a long sad story.  But I digress.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 3/19 As for $PLUG yesterday, saw a stock under tremendous pressure from rising rates and a falling NASDAQ - looks like it didn't crack to me.  Came down, but the volume was low.

And since so many want to make Cramer the focus - sure, I'll give you my take on him.  Watched the Bear Stearns video and I saw a fellow who was just going with what Bear Stearns was putting out at the time - Bear Stearns wasn't going to tell anybody they were on the verge of collapse!  And none of us wanted to believe it!  If he truly had any info they were going under I doubt he wouldn't have touched that question with a ten foot pole!  And it sure sounded like he was talking about the accounts, not the stock.

Tell you what else I've seen, a fellow who was the early warning system for the 2007-2008 financial crash and told people to get out.   A fellow whose friend and mentor, Mark Haines (R.I.P) actually called the bottom.

However I'll admit the futures manipulation video was concerning.  But he looked like a person who wanted to get it off his chest and was willing to let the chips fall where they may.  In the long run it is good to know how the game is sometimes played.  I'm still willing to believe Cramer has been trying to redeem himself over the years."

For anyone wondering what he's talking about, there's a source. Cramer IS an actual criminal and provenly untrustworthy, you should *NEVER* trust what he has to say.

Here's a phenomenal example, him openly talking about how he and others commit market manipulation; don't take my word on him, take Jim Cramer's word on Jim Cramer.

He's sold out millions of ppl and earned billions for his friends, all so that he can keep his outrageous salary on cnbc. And im certain cnbc gets obscene ""advertising rates"" on their commercials as a form of legal kickbacks and he gets his huge salary and consistent contract renewals with raises. (Tbf i don't watch TV almost ever so idk, but I'll bet there's plenty of that)

Its not even a well thought out scam but it is what it is and its been successful for him his entire life. Every aspect of him has been trying to con the poor to keep himself rich. Its gross"

So now his friends have to trade on his behalf, despite this he still does it but there's ""no proof"" that he is because he doesn't hold stocks in his name anymore. The guys a criminal.

2021-03-18 05:04:54,stocks,CAT (Caterpillar) DD? Has anyone seen any good DD on Caterpillar? They had a couple of recent PT increases and the recent dips have not seemed to affect them. I would have thought the pandemic really hurt them but it seems like the opposite and I am quite perplexed. Anyone have any PT opinions? Thanks for any input.
03/18/2021,stocks,"A mass of land half the size of Europe just realized that having a generator for their building if their privatized power grid shits the bed would be a REAL good idea, so I expect CAT to do well in 2021-2022"

03/18/2021,stocks,"Coming from someone who uses cat equipment in my industry, there has not been any slow down in demand for new machines. A lot of companies are even moving twards needing less men to operate machines. Meaning more demand when wages increase. Not minancial advice, you’ve made me wonder though. I will do some dd."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I’m not sure exactly why they didn’t dip but construction industry wasn’t really halted because of the pandemic. The whole construction industry was considered essential I believe. There were contract labor teams I knew that continued to work after people on the crew tested positive for COVID.

03/18/2021,stocks,I think CAT will do good.  Biden says he wants to fix infrastructure.  Wouldn't that mean they need heavy machines to do that.  The news is saying there's no chance of him passing anything like that until at least summer because of the stimulus just passing.  I wanted to buy them but isn't it at a ATH?  Just seems expensive ATM.  Idk but I expect to see sales when the infrastructure law passes.  Not advice.

03/18/2021,stocks,"Wall Street has a habit a raising price targets after a rally instead of before. I think Caterpillar is decent reopening play, but I think there are better places to put your money. Definitely a better option than EV stocks or most of the meme stocks though."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Ive been planning on doing a post about Deere. I think it is the most superior industrial stock for the next 3 years and I much prefer it to Cat. 

Inflation is raising commodity prices which leads to more ag equipment sales and forestry equipment sales for Deere. But it benefits two fold on an infrastructure bill because of possible inflation (continuing to raise commodity prices) but mainly because it owns the Wirtgen Group. Which is the machinery for road construction and maintenance."

2021-03-18 04:44:25,stocks,"Hindenburg Research is about to get taken for a $RIDE I’m so sick of short sellers like Citron and Hindenburg to the point where I’ve decided to load up on shares and calls on Hindenburg’s latest target, Lordstown Motors.

If you haven’t heard of Hindenburg Research, they are a group of 5 dudes who work out of an apartment in NY. They take large short positions in companies and then release research reports to the public to slander them for their own financial gain.

They are primarily known for their hit-piece on Nikola last year – which I think anyone could have called out. Nikola had no factory or means of production for several years.. pretty easy to expose them especially once their stock ran up to $80/share.

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg Attacks Lordstown With Multiple Inaccurate Claims**

Last Friday, Hindenburg went after Lordstown Motors saying they have no “sellable product” and that they are “3-4 years away” from production (according to “former employees”)

Well – Lordstown had an investor call earlier today confirming that production is beginning THIS September (in 6 months), and they also provided [video evidence](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1372178838063570944?s=20) that they are currently in the beta phase (think of beta as essentially 97% of the finalized vehicle).

Additionally, Texas-based E-Squared Energy CEO [came to the defense of Lordstown](https://www.cfo.com/capital-markets/2021/03/lordstown-motors-responds-to-short-seller/) after the short report explaining that they intend to fill all 14,000 orders over a 2-3 year period. Lordstown is targeting fleet customers initially, so they will be selling a lot of vehicles to service partners like E-Squared Energy (who then sell to actual fleets).

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg was right about Nikola.. Aren’t they probably right about Lordstown too?**

Nope. I live in Ohio near the enormous Lordstown facility, and that parking lot has been packed every day with workers for about 2 years now. I also know first-hand what this company means to the state of Ohio. Lordstown is in the final due diligence phase for the [Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (“ATVM”) loan opportunity](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) – which is a very big deal for any company, especially a start-up. They have over 500 employees and over 200 consultants working there currently. The number of workers will be double by production in September.

Lordstown’s flagship *Endurance* truck will be [shown in action as a proof of concept](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-unveils-truck-for-race-in-mexican-desert/) next month in one of the toughest races ever designed, the San Felipe 250. You can also see numerous other videos of their truck via their YouTube channel.

&#x200B;

**Brief history on Lordstown Motors:**

Lordstown Motors acquired a [6.2 million square foot facility back in 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html) – this facility now has a replacement value of \~ $3 billion, but they received it for pennies on the dollar due to [GM’s desire to invest](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) in Lordstown. Within their massive production facility, they have carved out an [800,000 square foot area for their propulsion facility](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/lordstown-motors-releases-business-updates-prepares-ohio-factory-to-begin-building-betas-next-month) – which will house production lines for advanced battery packs and hub motors.

Lordstown’s CEO, Steve Burns, is an entrepreneur who has always been ahead of his time. Over 15 years ago, he created a startup called MobileVoiceControl—a predecessor to Siri. The technology patents that Burns developed were then sold and [used to help Apple create Siri](https://www.cincinnatimagazine.com/article/steve-burns-wants-lordstown-motors-to-build-the-worlds-best-electric-pickup-truck/).

&#x200B;

**Summary of Lordstown’s investor call from 4:30pm EST today:**

1. It was confirmed that production will begin this September – which will make the *Endurance* the first ever *full-size* electric pick-up truck to hit the road. This will allow them first-mover advantage into the massive light duty truck market.

2. The development mule that caught fire a few months ago was a result of human error – this was a human-made prototype, and the Betas that are currently being produced are being welded by robots (Betas are basically 97% of the actual finished product – so these will be a much more accurate depiction of the final vehicle than the development mules were several months ago).

3. In the coming weeks, as betas come off the production line, the vehicles will be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.

4. The fleet vehicle market is unique – which is why pre-order numbers are more based on calculated estimates from service partners like E-Squared Energy (mentioned earlier) and [Holman Enterprises](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-and-holman-enterprises-announce-co-marketing). Holman manages 2 million vehicles including 600K pick-ups. These service partners buy from Lordstown and then sell directly to fleets. It’s important to build relationships early-on with these service partners especially since Lordstown is going to be first-to-market in 6 months.

5. Demand remains very strong amongst service partners, government agencies, and commercial fleets. 

&#x200B;

**This is all great, but how in the world will a company from small-town Ohio scale across the whole country?**

To help scale and increase a country-wide presence, [LM recently partnered with Camping World](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/16/2146315/0/en/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry.html). This partnership will allow Lordstown to leverage over 170 Service and Collision Centers across the US, with thousands of technicians and service bays via Camping World’s footprint.

Marcus Lemonis is the CEO of Camping World and a successful businessman and entrepreneur featured on “The Profit.” This man would not enter a long-term strategic partnership with a company unless it was the **real deal**, and I can tell you with 100% confidence that he’s been [all-in on Lordstown](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1327013275821891585?lang=en) since last year. I highly recommend visiting Marcus’ twitter and looking through all of the videos and tweets pertaining to Lordstown.

[Joe Burrow](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/work-for-it-joe-burrow) is on board too!

&#x200B;

**Anything else besides their Endurance truck?**

They announced today that they will do a demonstration of their [electric van](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup) this summer, and it will begin production next year. Their 3rd vehicle will likely be a large SUV.

Keep in mind that as of 2021, the [global light duty vehicles market size is valued at over $600 billion](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/light-duty-vehicles-market) – creating a lot of space for companies like Lordstown to come in and disrupt the industry with their advanced technology and a low price point ($45,000 after federal tax credit).

But given all of that, I think $RIDE’s current *market cap* is currently wayyyy too low especially relative to others in the EV industry. 

&#x200B;

**What is a market cap?**

Market cap—or market capitalization—refers to the total value of all a company's shares of stock. It is calculated by multiplying the price of a stock by its total number of outstanding shares. 

Market cap allows investors to understand the relative size of one company versus another. It effectively measures what a company is worth on the open market, as well as the market's perception of its future prospects.

&#x200B;

**Why are you talking about market cap?**

Because I think it is important to look at Lordstown’s market cap in comparison with two of the other most popular start-up EV truck companies based in the US. *These numbers were from 3pm EST earlier today*:

*Nikola $NKLA - $5.9 billion market cap*

*Canoo $GOEV - $3.9 billion market cap*

**What is Lordstown’s market cap?**

*Lordstown $RIDE - $2.3 billion market cap*

Listen.. I’m just making the point that Lordstown has one of the **biggest factories** in the country and also will be able to produce [**600,000 vehicles annually**](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/shutdown-in-lordstown/lordstown-motors-seeks-state-waiver-to-sell-future-vehicles-directly-to-consumers-in-ohio) in a couple of years’ time. 

Lordstown is only 6 months away from **mass producing** (not hand-making) the world’s first ever *full size* electric pick-up truck. An *Endurance* will be coming off the production line every 6 minutes in September, and then every 4 minutes beginning in 2022. This is a very big deal, and I think it’s only a matter of time until the stock is accurately-priced especially relative to its peers.

Companies like Nikola, Canoo, and many other EV start-ups are year(s) away from mass production. And I can’t even imagine the 10’s of billions of dollars it will cost those companies to get to market – meanwhile, Lordstown acquired their state-of-the-art facility for [$40 million](https://www.mbtmag.com/home/news/21244850/lordstown-motors-to-finish-first-electric-truck-prototypes-in-march) (and then a couple hundred million in re-tooling the facility). But seriously – this is basically pennies compared to what other EV players like Rivian are paying for their production facilities.

&#x200B;

**Is this just a pump and dump DD post?**

Nope – I’m actually holding mostly January 2023 calls (LEAPS) - meaning that I believe in the long-term growth story here. I have 10 January 2023 call contracts at a $40 strike price. My price target for January 2023 is $150/share, which would mean a market cap of \~ $20 billion. This is a very volatile stock if you look at the 6-month chart, which is why I think holding onto shares or LEAPS is the smartest approach. It is also worth noting that the average price target between the 5 analysts that cover the stock is $30.

Additionally, I hate Hindenburg, and seeing that “report” last Friday set me off. That’s what caused me to do so much research into Lordstown over the past week.

&#x200B;

**Summary:**

To quote Warren Buffett, “You should be greedy when others are fearful”

Hindenburg Research putting out a hit-piece against $RIDE has created some fear for investors. This fear has caused a sell-off and an increasingly high short interest in the stock – I think Hindenburg and the remaining shorts are going to have to cover by the end of this week before they get burned really badly. This company is very real and it is now in the public-eye more than it has ever been.

And to the doubters and bears that will appear in the comments - you’re going to come back and look at this post in about a year when $RIDE is valued about 3-4x of its current price and wish you would have loaded up on these cheap shares ;)

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Citron and Hindenburg can go straight to hell. Load the boat on shares of $RIDE – this chart is poised for a breakout. Read my whole post if you want to see why Lordstown is legit and Hindenburg isn’t.

03/18/2021,stocks,I don’t know if I’d use a **Warren Buffet** quote to justify this investment
03/18/2021,stocks,"Your profile history is all about Lordstown. I am staying away, thanks."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Unpopular opinion: six months after Hindenburg's piece on Nikola, the company admitted [its ousted chairman misled investors](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/nikola-is-paying-8point1-million-in-legal-fees-for-ousted-chairman-milton.html). 

Apparently the concrete details in their hit piece on $RIDE are convincing enough to [bring the SEC into it](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders), the same way they got involved after its piece on Nikola. 

Ambulance chaser lawsuits are one thing. SEC investigations are for real and should be taken seriously. 

Tread with caution everyone, please. Go with speculative positions only. YOLO plays and GME-style rallies are seriously ill-advised at this point."
03/18/2021,stocks,I didn't see the part where you addressed the CEO defrauding investors with falsified orders.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I like Lordstown a lot more than Nikola or several others for the reasons you mentioned, but if they exaggerated preorders to the extent reported that's a very Nikola-esque red flag.

My main reason to avoid it right now though would be the very high execution risks. Fleet sales is a tough business to break into given how risk adverse or ossified a lot of the buyers are.

If it drops to $10 or so I may take a minimal position given the size of the market, but I still like VW and Hyundai's odds of transitioning a lot more than a newcomer's odds of succeeding this late in the game."
03/18/2021,stocks,"To nitpick a little... a packed parking lot does not equal mass production. And a computer rendering does not equal a finished product. There are still a lot of risks and the timeline is probably aggressive as they try to scale. I will say Citron can eat shit, but Hindenburg seems to be more often right than wrong. Do your own research, I still consider Lordstown speculative."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Even if there was no report or SEC investigation, EVs based on hub motors are still an incredibly risky investment seeing as how they've never been shown to work in a commercial vehicle. Doesn't mean they can't, and it doesn't mean that money shouldn't be put into researching/refining new technologies, but it does mean that there is inherent risk involved here until something concrete is proven over time.

Also, just because you own LEAPs doesn't mean you wouldn't profit from a pump and dump. It's not like you have to hold the option until expiration, you could easily profit off of a brief increase in stock price and volatility and dump your options.

Personally, I would love to see a hub motor based EV succeed and I think their pickup design looks cool. However, any investment that I would make in this right now I would consider as extremely risky and would want to be prepared to lose almost the entirety of it."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yikes, the ceo basically admits to making up the bogus preorders here (just trying to gauge interest...)

They bought the building , with a LOAN FROM GM.

03/18/2021,stocks,"Oh boy, is this company FUCKED. The CEO just went onto CNBC and said ""We don't have any pre-orders. I don't think anyone thought we had serious pre-orders. We're not even in the stage where we can have pre-orders yet."" after he literally said ON MULTIPLE TV CHANNELS they tons of pre-orders, had sold trucks, etc. etc.

This is going to be the easiest case the SEC ever reviewed..."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I mean...iirc one of the individuals quoted by Hindenburg straight up said he had no intention of buying the vehicles attributed to him as preorders. 

Said it was a marketing agreement. Gonna be a no for me Dawg. Good luck tho!"
03/18/2021,stocks,">I’m so sick of short sellers like Citron and Hindenburg to the point where I’ve decided to load up on shares and calls on Hindenburg’s latest target, Lordstown Motors.

Emotional investing is of course a sound way of making money.

I don't really know the company so I'll be happy to be proven wrong, but here are a couple easy counters to these (mostly semantic) arguments. Seeing people going in and out of a place does not equate multi-billion dollar corporation. Speculating on 600k production ""in a couple year"" from a workshop is a crap shoot, took Tesla nearly two decades to get there (and it had tailwinds Lordstown can only dream of, namely a very singular CEO/capital seeder/talent magnet), but this guy will get there no problem? Being 6 months away from mass producing has a 50/50 chance of being BS (made up odds, but the point stands) or over-selling. If there is a hickup, shareholders are the ones financing it. Other overpriced SPACs do not make a third fairly priced. Tesla is the first successful car mass producer in over a century, but all of a sudden there's a bunch of SPACs that will breed successful car makers (hmm). 

But mostly, it seems you worked your thesis backwards starting from ""Citron bad"", so it's hard to read the rest seriously... FWIW, I've bagheld Aphria for 2-3 years after Hindenburg turned it to tainted meat (rightfully, at the time, altho it wasn't a problem unique to the name... but it did work out wonderfully and I thank them for all the cheap shares), so I'm not exactly their friend, but being long because you're mad at a short is nonsense and kind of self-destructive."
03/18/2021,stocks,I'd be angry too if im bagholding a stock that is shorted by a short seller. 🤷‍♀️
03/18/2021,stocks,"The **most glaring part of the report** was not about when/if production would start. **It was that Lordstown continually put out press releases saying they had thousands of new pre-orders.** They listed the company names and the number of vehicles pre-ordered. It turns out those ""pre-orders"" were not pre-orders at all. They were just marketing gimmicks for both RIDE and for the company on the other end to just raise their profiles. Some weren't even companies with operations or employees. If that is true, idk how they ever thought they could get away with that (like...damn), with all the public attention on EV companies. I think the SEC investigation is going to blow this all up if even part of that is true."

03/18/2021,stocks,"I'd like to see the company succeed, the sales difficulty will be giving customers piece of mind that they can have the vehicle serviced nearby. The partnership with Travel Land will be helpful, but technicians to service the completely new vehicles will be a challenge."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Hindenburg is extremely legit.

Enjoy losing your money."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Hindenberg is one of the good guys. They call out actual fraud, and draw shorts and regulatory attention to it. This helps good companies get investment instead. They crushed NKLA as an example, which was a web of lies (per their report), and that company is still under DOJ and SEC investigation as a result."
03/18/2021,stocks,This seems like a pump and dump to me
03/18/2021,stocks,"So I like the sound of their tech and if have a working product and a way to produce usually orders come in, but I have a few issues;

1. I took a look at their 3yr, 1yr, and 9 months chart on a weekly. From the looks of it they are on a major downward trend since beginning of February and the this Hindenburg report came out in March right. What is causing the trend? If you take look there is kind of pattern looks like every couple months this gets pumped up to $30/share then bleeds to the 10-15 range, this would be the start of the 4th cycle.

2) Even if the have a product, factory, and GM partner doesn’t mean they will be profitable this year or next for that matter, GM didn’t invest their whole company in them, they could drop them and right it off as a bad investment. You said it yourself you have 10-40c for Jan 23, so not expecting profit for awhile.

3) All I have seen lately is DD on Reddit that turns out to be a pump and dump, and judging by the recent price history it seems even if you are-not intending that it is happening. Would be interesting if a search was done for RIDE growth DD for Aug 2020, Nov 2020, end Dec 2020, and March 2021. 

Just saying when I see a pattern like this it raises to many questions, lowers my trust in it, and I don’t risk my money if I can’t trust the numbers or at least what I see. This why I bounced out of GME there were too many people trying to explain patterns by speculation or just blaming an outside entity. If I see a bad pattern developing I exit, even I will miss the moon.

To be honest, I almost queued up a 200 share buy order for tomorrow, but after looking at this I think I will sit it out and wait to see if the stock can hold $30 for longer than a week, since it will be worth at least 150 buying in at a stable 30 wouldn’t be bad.

Thanks for the DD, and best of luck.

Edit: grammar/typos"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Idk, they took down both Nikola and wrecked me with KNDI but I’m glad they do their work so people don’t get fucked in it even later.

Well, if their research proves to be right, which when the SEC gets involved I guess it sometimes is."

03/18/2021,stocks,"mate, not gonna lie I saw the news about hindenburg, I bought the dip without actually reading the report. Now, I actually read the report and it honestly doesn't look good. I will hodl until the SEC report comes out or I see the 57 betas that they promise by the end of the month. 

Position: 4k shares fml"
03/18/2021,stocks,The CEO of Lordstown is a known liar. You need to say away from RIDE and most of these EV spacs. You will get burned. Even companies like $XL are getting caught inflating their pipeline and it's a huge problem for the sector. Wait for the collapse then buy the real winners. Now is not the time to invest in any of this crap trading at multiples of 2025 imaginary earnings...
03/18/2021,stocks,"There’s nothing wrong with short selling and these reports. I hate posts like this because it clearly comes from stock holders or promoters wanting a rally. Buy calls and/or equity and just let the market choose.

Edit: one last thing, your point goes out the door because you’re so fixated on them looking for short positions that you failed to see that Nikola admitted to misleading the market."

03/18/2021,stocks,">They are primarily known for their hit-piece on Nikola last year – which I think anyone could have called out. Nikola had no factory or means of production for several years.. pretty easy to expose them especially once their stock ran up to $80/share.










So...why didn't you call it out? Did you enter a short position at any point before the report? Why is Reddit filled with these armchair ""investors"" that make terrible investments but are quick to show their incredible 20/20 hindsight."

I understand if its incorrect info then yes its manipulation but if it's correct info this isn't slander, they are actually helping the market bcuz this has given a chance for random EV companies to public via SPAC's.  They also aren't a non-profit lol"
03/18/2021,stocks,They’re short because this company has already had many obstacles and have hit many walls. They offer one product. Don’t get me wrong I like the company. Held the SPAC sold the merger but this is probably one of their better shorts

I believe in Lordstown and all they have to do is successfully start rolling off Betas in 10 days and the Hindenburg report will fade from memory and the stock price will rise."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I have no opinion on or position in Lordstown. But the Hindenburg/Citron/Muddy Waters types are close enough to being criminals that someone should find a way to make their behavior clearly criminal. Whether a stock is overvalued or not, whether a company is engaging in questionable (or even fraudulent) behavior the price of a stock will be driven down just by the fact of the Short Sellers ""Research"" Report being published, irrespective of the legitimacy of the contents. It doesn't matter if they are right or wrong, they just instantly make money because they get out their message to possibly jittery share holders without any review or consequence. I've had a couple of stocks that these scumbags put out a report on and the first time I just sold after a 20% drop (esp. because it wasn't a company I had a lot of conviction in) only to see it come back pretty quickly. After that I have not listened to these creeps. If you could sell the instant their ""report"" goes out you probably should, but they are generally doing the research for someone else, as well, so by the time retail knows about it the damage is already done. Otherwise, unless the report is really convincing there is no reason to panic sell, and typically there is some short term rebound (even if they have successfully killed the overall momentum)."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Thank you for taking the time and laying this out for me and others...I posted a comment yesterday about RIDE and was labeled an imbecile, some other negative commentary about my investment and short attack. It was inferred I lacked DD in making my investment well above which is well above the current share pricing.  Well.... I purchased more shares again today....not just 1 or 2 shares....a tad bit more (it helped bring my average SP down a bit).

I tuned into the 4:30 press conference and listened.  Didn't seem to me like a bunch of Bull Shit, scheming liars or con artists.   I own a pick and owned a Land Rover....I've watched their Endurance Truck perform against the Ford F150 early on.  I realize there Truck is not perfected yet.  The real test in Bahi in April will be interesting. I've been on 2 all day Land Rover manufacturer/dealer sponsored off road excursions so I know 1st hand how grueling this can be on a vehicle.  Since the election, here in PA gas is up to $3.10 a gallon and it seems like its going up .10 a gallon every 2-3 weeks.   With estimated range to the equivalent of of 75 mile per gallon with the EV vehicle, projected pricing at $45K, lower maintenance costs, seems like they are hitting all consumer points....

I'm no stock guru, it's not my full time gig.  Rather play a bit in the stock market rather then making less then 2% is a bank CD or a  bit more in a Vanguard or Fidelity Mutual Fund.  I'm in the real estate development biz...I understand laying out huge amounts of cash and hard work that needs to be accomplished before any $$ come back (you have to win more then you lose)....

I'm all about American made & American jobs...I live in PA, next to you in Ohio and I understand the magnitude/size of this Lordstown facility and the potential positive impact to the local community but to the region and state.   So...you want to talk about having Balls and taking Risk.....the RIDE group, got it eyes deep.  After listening today....seeing your post...comments to my post yesterday....I'll buy more shared tomorrow at the open, wait it out...if it doesn't work out...I'll just chalk it up to a charitable contribution to an American Company having BALLS..trying to do the right thing...in a small American, blue collar town where people need to go to work, hard work, to feed & make a better life for their families.  The RIDE workers and management team are not sitting by a computer part or all day...trading shares to make money...some may think its work...That's NOT WORK to me!!!!"

03/18/2021,stocks,"FYI the Freightliner eCascadia is based on a 4 hub motor design. It's in development too, but there's plenty of real world testing miles already. Any electric motor and related tech in commercial vehicles is unproven and has some risk. I would say a company only making these vehicles is more risky since they have nothing else to fall back on."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Too late to get in once its proven. Another case of the, ill just wait until I know and everyone else in the market does, pay the premium, and miss the entire run up because I can't think from a first principles standpoint and lack any real risk tolerance.

03/18/2021,stocks,"Not sure if anyone caught the interview, but it was super damning. It was about as cringey as you can get. I felt embarrassed for the CEO! Cramer was laughing at him afterward like he just witnessed a kid piss their pants in front of class. It's hard to imagine a worse interview. Lordstown is fucked. They misled people bigly."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You're complicating things. It's really quite simple. All investing/trading is comparable to gambling, which always works out better if you can stack the deck in your favor. This is what we mean by the phrase, *""House always wins.""*

Step 1 - Find a new, vulnerable company, harvest and analyze all available data. *Buying the gun.*

Step 2 - Begin gradually buying shares and calls. *Buying ammunition.*

Step 3 - Strategize a short position on said company's stock, buy puts, then wait carefully for the most opportune time to strike.
*Loading the gun.*

Step 4 - Hire a disposable entity to cherry-pick said data in order to strain public credulity. If shit goes sideways, burn the easily replaced entity.
*Aiming the gun.*

Step 5 - Covered or naked, short the stock at high volume and terminal velocity.

*You get the idea.*

Step 6 - Repeat steps 1 thru 5.

03/18/2021,stocks,Can you link me to one of these press releases?
03/18/2021,stocks,Lordstown’s truck is a full-size pick-up focused on fleets / government contracts
03/18/2021,stocks,"Very legit criminals.  I don’t see how people are allowed to manipulate the stock market for financial gains like that.   It should be a criminal offense.

Hindenburg waits until the peak of a companies lime light when they know it will go up and then bet against it by rigging the fight.   And make a boat load of money off all those who invested in this company."
03/18/2021,stocks,Them why is their “report” so obscure? Who are these supposed “former employees”?
03/18/2021,stocks,I will tell you now I plan to exercise my calls in 2023 when this is over $100/share.. not a pump and dump.. come look at this comment a year from now when this is $50+
03/18/2021,stocks,"I really appreciate this comment.. lots of people just come on here and bash lordstown after reading the Hindenburg accusations.

Sounds like you’re a very open-minded person.. I think all of your points are valid. The stock market never makes sense to me in the short term, so I try to stay away from short term calls and stuff. The reason I’m holding long term ones is that I’m very optimistic on their future... EVs have gotten hit hard though and I do think it’s only a matter of time until EVs get hot again."
03/18/2021,stocks,"No, they didn’t. As of January, 2021 

Nikola continues work on its first production facility in Coolidge, Arizona.

Nikola Motor has not produced any products yet. It doesn't even have a factory. The company is building a factory in Coolidge, Ariz. The site has been cleared and construction will begin in 2020, Milton told TechCrunch in a recent interview, adding that he hoped for it to start this summer."

03/18/2021,stocks,Me too; but tbf that's about $25 😎
03/18/2021,stocks,"Make your own decisions of course, but I'd get out as soon as I can. The CEO just went onto national TV saying he never said they had any pre-orders and were just trying to gauge interest when there are at least a handful of videos from earlier broadcasts on national TV where he literally said ""we have tons of pre-orders"" or ""we have already sold a bunch of trucks"". This is a scam.

Also, they recently had a test drive with a prototype and it caught fire and burned to the ground. Which can happen with a prototype, but not 6 months before you're supposed to enter customer delivery."
03/18/2021,stocks,The alphas haven't been successfully driven without catching on fire... Why they are moving on to Betas has me scratching my head.
03/18/2021,stocks,You need (and want) short sellers for an efficient marketplace.
03/18/2021,stocks,"No that’s incorrect. If I wrote a short report no one cares cause I have no track record. Same thing if I wrote a lordstown is the best company ever report. But if someone who has caught a fraud before writes a short report, people are more inclined to listen. Just how if buffet discloses he bought Coca Cola it goes up 10%. Obviously someone can ride a reputation a long tome and last performance is not indicative of future performance but the reason Hindenburg moves market is cause people have seen them be right before and value their opinions"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Wait, they are the criminals? How about for example how last year Muddy unraveled how Luck Coffee was fabricating their sales?
If anything, many of these short activists are helping in exposing a company before they rope in even more investors."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Citron is definitely immoral, but Hindenburg has been on point on a lot of their reports."
03/18/2021,stocks,Thank you! I put a lot of time into researching and I think this company is a winner in the long run!
03/18/2021,stocks,I'd suggest [watching this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gP3wJvL1xc) before you get in.

03/18/2021,stocks,"Short reports are important for the stock market to be healthy by targeting fraudulent companies. And the people writing these short reports should be allowed to short companies based off their research.

These short sellers have an incentive to make reports that are at least somewhat accurate, or else their source of money will eventually stop because the market will stop listening to them because of how often they are wrong.

I’m not endorsing citron or Hindenburg in any way, but high quality short sellers are important. And the good ones should be rewarded for their work through shorting."

03/18/2021,stocks,Right?
03/18/2021,stocks,I agree.. this high short interest alone will send it back to 30 lol once there’s good news this will fly
03/18/2021,stocks,TSLA is a cult and is not comparable to RIDE.
03/18/2021,stocks,Hindenburg won’t be around much longer.. IMO. Only a matter of time until they get slapped with a massive fine or prison time
03/18/2021,stocks,"Sos is different though.  I’m willing to roll with SOS because They came out and disputed everything line by line and had a full on video of their miners and location.  Besides; miners and BTC is hard to fabricate.  You either have the miners and BTC or you don’t.  It’s been proven they mined their first BTC already.

By contrast to SOS; Lordstown has not defended themselves one bit."

03/18/2021,stocks,I like any calls rn.. look at the 6 month chart.. lowest this will go is $13.. should bounce back especially after JPow’s comments today.. growth stocks should be fine for the foreseeable future
03/18/2021,stocks,"They are capitalizing on the stupidity and ignorance in the market to sow fear and create confusion that they can profit off of. Financial terrorism lite, if you will."
03/18/2021,stocks,Hahaha I was thinking that the other day.. they Def named themselves that for a reason.. but some day they will collapse too just like the Hindenburg lol
03/18/2021,stocks,It will be back at $30 by the end of this summer.. such a good buying point rn.
03/18/2021,stocks,They did take a short position.
03/18/2021,stocks,They usually release the reports when a company starts to have a big upswing so they can rig the game and they bet against it knowing their report will make the stock fall when it has the greatest time for growth so they make the most money.  Hence why they time the release of their reports.
03/18/2021,stocks,Lol
03/18/2021,stocks,What evidence? Who were their “sources” they never said.
03/18/2021,stocks,Absolute craziness
03/18/2021,stocks,"Because they still have a ton of cash, enough cash to actually do at least some of the things they've promised. I would not invest in them but they still have plenty of runway to pull something off with competent leadership."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Before you downvote me, I would like to say I love speculative plays...

The fact of the matter is I work in Silicon Valley, and the NDAs we have to sign with some startups would guarantee to ruin our lives if we ever gave up our names. They are iron-clad contracts.

With regards to Lordstown Motors I'm not saying one way or the other because I truly don't know. I'm only stating why an employee with information would need to stay anonymous."
03/18/2021,stocks,Most of their “evidence” is from undisclosed “former employees.”
03/18/2021,stocks,"That is called market inefficiency and nikola should be and will be at zero but the fact that you have a factory doesn't mean that you can't commit fraud, enron was huge and they committed fraud, basically your point that lordstown has credibility because it has parts of a company is flawed."

And the brother of former ceo is the “head” of their hydrogen development. Before that, the guy was a handyman putting in drywall.

Nikola is like flaming garbage sprinkled on a dogshit sandwich."

03/18/2021,stocks,"- Guy Who Knows Nothing About Fleet Sales & Just Pulls Shit Out Of His Ass. 

Seems like a good reason. I take financial advice from my dentist. If you actually have a reason to say fleet sales is hard, like experience, or data, sure. Otherwise, it seems like you just picked something to whine about and somehow think its credible based on nothing except you feeling that way. 

Watching people do what you do with information, just generalize something based on nothing and somehow materialize an opinion based on your emotion. It really blows my fucking mind. Because you're not the only one. So many of you on here do that."

03/18/2021,stocks,That like saying... Yeah the nr is wrong but its ok because it complicated. Mate if you cant see how it addresses nothing then idk man
03/18/2021,stocks,"Thanks, there doesn't need to be publicly recorded instruments to smell something that reeks.

I get your point. It was the more than likely in the terms of GM's loan to them to purchase the building. I'm searching for further actual proof, seeing it says it was a memo from GM which is being mentioned because GM refused to release the terms of the loan. 

I'm on neither side here but let's use logic. GM does not care about any community , they care about money. Even if they were attempting to help the community , this is far from the best or most obvious way to do that. Why would you lose that much money on a building, GM especially, it's not Google. GM has a limited run here and they're not stupid, they're not going to just give up a building worth a billion dollars. That buildings value is a literal lifeline for them, that is of course if the value is even valid. As far as I know, that area of Ohio is basically Detroit. Real estate is a joke , you can have a building ""valued"" at a million dollars as it sits there completely empty for 20 years until they finally demolish it. Value has lost it's actual meaning, which is what people will pay for it.  


I see GM using Lordstown Motors as their way of staying relevant. One of their biggest issues is unions and this is a clear as day way of avoiding unions. That building has been vacant for like a year, and they didn't even attempt to sell it for a realistic price as far as I can see."

03/18/2021,stocks,"It's the platform, not the track record. Everyone knows Jim Cramer is an idiot but it if he goes on TV--maybe a special alert in the midst of some daytime show saying that he has uncovered fraud in [NAME ONE OF A THOUSAND COMPANIES TRADING ON FOMO AND SENTIMENT] and the stock will crash.

And do you have any idea what percentage of their reports are actually correct? Citron outed Peloton and put a price target on it of $5. Was that correct? They ripped a new one for Hailang Education in April 2018 and, yeah, its phenomenal growth has stopped but it is at the same price as when they attacked it and its valuation is very reasonable. Also in 2018 (when Wayfair was trading in the low $100s) Citron's ""research"" argued that it would not simply fall back to $45 that it had been in 2017 but rather that the correct price target is $10. Wayfair is currently over $300. 

I'm not going to go through all their archived ""reports"" (or those of Hindenburg, and MW)--I didn't cherry pick, just figured the first three they have posted make the point. You should be able to pick up on the fact that they are worse than bounty hunters because all they care about is whether they can move the price of the stock. I guess you could flatter them by calling them confidence men. The fact that, perhaps by chance, they are sometimes right, makes their con more effective."
03/18/2021,stocks,Stock manipulation is criminal behavior. Stock bashing is a form of stock manipulation. They are not doing this to protect investors.

I’d like for it to go as far as jail time and losing licenses if they knowingly spread false info, but I don’t see that happening. I could see them posting 100% whole-cloth lies and get away with it in today’s climate. 

Short selling has its place, but like I said I’m enjoying watching their pathetic $3M short immediately get gobbled up by the market. The timing is horrible for them as well, what with GME about to pop off again and margin calls suddenly being hot. If they really believe the crap they peddle they should have played it safe selling calls and buying puts, but they are a one trick pony only in it for the short term. 

Kinda sad, because the efforts they go through to steal value could be going to growing the market instead. Better long term value that way. Buffet didn’t get to where he is by being a (rainbow bear) shitkicker picking on emerging companies."

So I was asking if they were disclosing a short position this time, which makes me feel like they have a decent amount of trust in their research, or they think the retails trying to squeeze out shorts is a dying fad."

03/18/2021,stocks,"I dont see that problem with that, there are so many reasons as to why that employee would want to remain anonymous one of them so that the reddit crowd doesn't come and harass them."
03/18/2021,stocks,"This is how it works. Current employees very rarely snitch out companies. Sure they could be sourpuss ex employees, they very often turn out to be legit complaints though with very legit evidence to back it up.

Everything around this company reeks of GM trying to profit in the long run by cutting out the union. There's a buttload of things outside Lordstown Motors itself about GM that you should mentioning here."
03/18/2021,stocks,Nikola is going to go to zero...? (X) doubt.

03/18/2021,stocks,Hydrogen that nikola will be using is not green nor is it efficient.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I cant belive there is a guy here actually defending nikola, it's like people don't learn when a company gets caught lying or breaking the law drop it like it's hot, people seemingly can't learn from enron and other cases"
03/18/2021,stocks,I believe Trevor’s brother primarily poured driveways for residential construction. Pretty much the same qualifications for head of hydrogen development. It’s all mixing chemicals.

03/18/2021,stocks,HAHH- spot on.
03/18/2021,stocks,Nobody is bagholding at $80 of NKLA.... nobody. You’re trying to hard to justify the asinine conclusion that this company will go to zero dollars...
03/18/2021,stocks,LOL
03/18/2021,stocks,Hub motors are typical in sheet rock Lowell’s they are just powered by diesel.  They allow you to lift 12 ft boards to a 4th story balcony on a slope.  Saying they have never been shown to work in a commercial vehicle is an absurd comment.
03/18/2021,stocks,There would be a publicly recorded Instrument with the purpose of clouding the title so it can not change hands.  They would not have such a provision without protecting their interest in this way.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm certainly not gambling any more than you are. I investigate everything I invest in, and I plot my entrance and exit strategies before I ever commit.

And I'm not your pal. Far from it."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Well people don’t mention how many time’s Hindenburg have done this with other companies and their research wasn’t legit but because they put a disclaimer in it that somehow protects them.   

Scam is only really a scam when the intent is to defraud.  A lot of these companies are trying to make a legit product and are not a scheme.   They are also not developed.   Do I agree with companies lying about their product, no.   Do I think short sellers should be able to purposefully publish something that manipulates the market.  No. How does one wrong out do the other?"
03/18/2021,stocks,Anyone scandalously rigging the game should be.  Kinda like insider trading in a way.
03/18/2021,stocks,Anyone who is telling the truth should be fine with going on the record.  The fact that they don’t is extremely suspicious.
03/18/2021,stocks,I’m not sure if I picked up on your sarcasm...that is my fault hahaha
03/18/2021,stocks,You know how much scrutiny Elon Musk has gone through? Everybody doubted him every single day till 2018 where things started to slightly turn around.
03/18/2021,stocks,Ya me too man. I’m still mad I passed up on apple. If I had the time to research it in 1985 I would’ve loaded up on it.
03/18/2021,stocks,"> I’ve been trading for some time now and have never seen such negative outreach about a random SPAC start up before.

All I can say is that not everything is a conspiracy. If everyone is negative about this company, it's a very real possibility that there's a reason for that. The CEO incriminating himself on national TV certainly doesn't help.

That said, I'm not trying to convince you or anything. You seem to know the risks you're getting into. I'd say the chance this company makes it to volume production is less than 1%, but if they manage to scapegoat the CEO and do get to volume production you're gonna bank big."
03/18/2021,stocks,Short sellers discovered Enron - the largest fraud in American History. Also Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Were these reports market manipulation?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Bashing a stock doesn’t constitute stock manipulation by the written law. 

The same way, posting a positive report about a company doesn’t constitute stock manipulation as well. Even if the firm that posted the report is long the stock. 

What they say while bashing a stock, or pumping a stock is the key difference to whether or not it’s actual stock manipulation."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I don’t think the premium on puts is worth it at these levels.. look at the 6 month chart. The stock is super volatile.. Obviously this is not investment advice but I have a lot of friends who are very into trading/charts, and they think the current set-up is very bullish.. it’s over 50% off of all time highs at this point.."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Not every EV company will become a Tesla.  LTM go to market strategy is to gain marketshare and visibility via fleet sales initially.  Do you know how big that marketplace is?   I single order size could be 20k, 100k, 200k plus.  Haven’t you seen Biden’s order to convert all government fleets to green vehicles.  This isn’t a Tesla buy your car on line with a credit card go to market. Target audience is the hardworking American that relies on heavy duty trucks to get a job done. Simple!"

03/18/2021,stocks,"Tell me how what Hindenburg released wasn’t a good short report? But, I bet you can’t give an unbiased answer because you’re invested in RIDE enough to be posting in their subreddit. I have no stake in this game, and can appreciate a solid short report.

If you weren’t invested in lordstown you’d be able to see that the report was credible enough to have the SEC start asking questions, which means that some of what Hindenburg said was true enough to raise eyebrows.

And citron didn’t stop going long, he just said he’s not gonna announce their short plays cause he’s getting attacked on Twitter, so “we” didn’t do anything."
03/18/2021,stocks,They also love loss porn lol. Perfect for them
03/18/2021,stocks,"JFC man, this place is amazing and shitty at the same  time to the most extreme levels... I guess that's that Bay.

I wish you well here man. Personally I can't wait until we can save enough money to live a simpler life in the country... or at least get out by Santa Cruz or Pismo.

EDIT: came here for the opportunity, it was provided. But I'm over it. Chasing money isn't my endgame."
03/18/2021,stocks,In my opinion you can’t call what Hindenburg does as research. They don’t ever site any of their sources. Its always “former business partners” or “former employees”. They never name anyone in particular. They could come out and outright lie and no one would know. They also have a financial interest in seeing the stock fall. Someone who stands to gain if the stock falls is going to try to make the situation sound as bad as possible. I just don’t think the report can be taken with the weight that it’s being taken with right now
03/18/2021,stocks,"The problem with that is a “former employee” said production is 3-4 years out, and Lordstown showed today they are in beta production and will be producing this September."
03/18/2021,stocks,You must be blind. God bless you child.
03/18/2021,stocks,"It will happen, nikola is worthless because it dosnt have a damn product or vision, lordstown does have a factory and all the parts of a company, problem is that does absolutely nothing to deny that the company faked preorders, it's like good job your company is legit but that dosent help addressing the issue because no one thought lordstown was faking their products and factory."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Nikola is doing a second offering so they can continue moving dirt in Arizona, what makes you bullish that the company can even make a single car? Just curious?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Considering it wasn’t a statement and I literally ended it with a **question mark...** no....

Also, I don’t have a number on the market share and profit margins, but I’m going to go on a limb and say LT isn’t anticipating the market share in Pickups that Nikola is anticipating in semis.

Wow you came in with some hostility."
03/18/2021,stocks,They are $80 bagholders. No choice but to defend their holdings. 🤷‍♀️
03/18/2021,stocks,I hope you meant that with a /s
03/18/2021,stocks,"it won't go to 0 but you'll be averaging down forever

the point of investing is to keep up with inflation eroding your purchase power.

The longer you hold heavy bags, the more inflation compounds on eroding your purchase power \^\_\^"
03/18/2021,stocks,then where would this be found? I mean I'm only going by your wordhere but I don't really see why this needs to be something that is documented in a way where the public has access to it?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Usually when someone calls you a pal after you call them a child, it is satirical. It is however interesting that your rebuttal to my criticism about OP's comments on the **business** and the starting point of his thesis is just more salt over short sellers. If you are a huge bull on them as your profile indicate, you should be welcoming Hindenburg for the cheaper entry rather then passive-aggressively explaining the process out of the blue."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Hindenburg hit on Nikola and Clover and those were widely reported. They were scams. 

Anybody purposely publishing bullshit is not going to last. And just because there is a legit problem doesn’t mean they will succeed with their shorts.

There is more market manipulation on CNBC than any of these short seller reports."
03/18/2021,stocks,Discovering shady practices and writing about them doesn't apply here
03/18/2021,stocks,also the short seller has IMMENSE liability if they say untruthful things. Hindenberg is very careful.
03/18/2021,stocks,"No, because they'll get sued personally with a SLAP lawsuit, and not be able to defend it. NKLA made a ton of lawsuit threats against critics as an example."
03/18/2021,stocks,If burglars discovered you have passed out from a stroke are they paramedics?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yes, manipulation through short and distort is absolutely illegal, and people/entities are charged for this. It is just hard to nail people for it because it requires showing that the shorter made deliberately false statements with the intent of driving the price down, and any half-competent weasel can concoct plausible deniability regarding that."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I think ""hard working americans"" are going to stick with over leveraging themselves on ford's."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Of course they have a chance, but when they were shorted into the ground they had a tiny chance of success. The stock was being demolished for over 5 years before Cohen came in and I doubt many could argue that GME was a great company circa 2015 to 2020."
03/18/2021,stocks,Read my comment on the top. Already answered your silly question. Im invested in alot of companies and im always loud. I hate seeing morons lose money because they don't know what they're talking about. Ive been doing this for a while. Just go read my comment at the top and get back to me.
03/18/2021,stocks,Haha
03/18/2021,stocks,"And someone who gains if the stock goes up will make it seem like everything is good, please stop with these double standards for shorts vs longs, also again there are so many reasons why those sources would be anonymous that is absolutely not uncommon, and generally if the sec thinks the report was good enough it's convincing now they might be lying and nothing happend but in situations like this just drop the stock, you don't want to be the guy holding enron after everything was revealed"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Well my issue is that I don't exactly trsut lordstown, why? Because first their ceo has a history of questionable activities also they have every incentive to lie, that's why I'm waiting on a sec report to come back, lordstown may not be lying but I just don't trust them in this situation because this is how it always goes down when the company is going to obviously deny allegations"
03/18/2021,stocks,"No chance. Nikola did the same thing, they showcased their truck and it was just a concept with no technology in it"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Lmao they're always ""a few months away"" from beta production. Why don't you take a look into Stephen Burns's history?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"In fairness, they do offer some pretty dank T-shirts on their website. /s"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Nikola has moving trucks you know? A factory that will be finished this year for that product, which it has. It’s also a hydrogen energy company which it can arguably make their primary objective. What are you talking about?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"They have 800 million in cash in hand still. Pre orders from Anheuser Busch. They have a competitive product (even working prototypes) in a growing market and they have dirt cheap hydrogen from Arizona public service which they will leverage into hydrogen stations and become a leading hydrogen supply.

Why on earth would they go to ZERO? Zero?!

Just curious."
03/18/2021,stocks,"But it’s not really fraud if you’re not taking money from people? When they specifically stated before “non-binding” every time they announced their pre-orders, do people forget that quickly? And we can speak from real life experience, I pass LMC every day on I-80 to go to work, and the parking lot is crowded and there’s a lot of activity going on. My company even bid to install one of their lines last year. I’ve seen it first hand, none of it is fraud."
03/18/2021,stocks,It was 100% a statement.. you just put a question mark at the end to be a smart ass 🤣🤣🤣
03/18/2021,stocks,I had hoped that was obvious.
03/18/2021,stocks,You’re admitting the one thing everyone else is too insane to admit... it’s NOT going down to zero. Thank you.
03/18/2021,stocks,"That comparison doesn't make sense - who are the paramedics in this situation? If a burglar discovered someone passed out from a stroke that was not discovered by a paramedic (or anyone else), then that burglar would add value to the world by alerting someone else that someone is passed out from a stroke."
03/18/2021,stocks,Good point!  A lot of truck owners love their brands.  Probably why LTM are hitting up fleets first.  Companies look at total cost of ownership a lot differently.  Cheers
03/18/2021,stocks,You may be part of Hindenburg for all I know😂 I’ve never seen someone back up a firm so strongly.
03/18/2021,stocks,"They have GM on their ass, they’re going to produce if Burns likes it or not. It’s not workhorse where GM wasn’t involved, GM won’t take shit from Burns I promise you that. Unlike Nikola, GM wasn’t involved like it is with LMC."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Waiting is the language of the poor. 


Literally the comment that started me on my entire financial journey. Wait, wait, wait. You can't wait. Because if you wait until after the fact something happens, the thing has already happened? Silly how so many people make up reasons to wait and fail to see the obviois flaw."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I can see what you’re saying here - but I bet you by the time the SEC comes back and clears them, the stock price will be back in the $20’s.. you can reference this comment in 2-3 months lol"
03/18/2021,stocks,"None of those trucks have been actually bought and many canceled their orders, and it has made so many false statements about its hydrogen tech, I just don't believe this company and not many people do, this company has been caught lying why would you want any part in that, I mean were here in this thread talking about how evil shorts are and then we turn around and back companies like nikola which have been caught lying and lordstown currently under sec investigation like cmon man."
03/18/2021,stocks,Moving by gravity does not count....
03/18/2021,stocks,Why are you shilling for a worthless company
03/18/2021,stocks,"When a company is caught breaking the law their investors dump their stock and they get sued and customers don't trust them, enron, worldcom, valeant and many others actually had sales but they overstated them, and nikola dosnt even have sales, you are literally asking why a fraudulent company goes to zero dude"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I do have to admit, there could be a play by the oil industry to ""go green"" using hydrogen as fuel so you may be right. the only thing is the prototype is just a prototype and let's see how 80 millis go until they have something solid."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I’ve invested into crypto when EVERYONE thought it was a “scam” back in 2018 when cryptos were at pennies, I bought VGX at $.02 now it’s worth over $5 a coin...I invested into Moderna when everybody didn’t think “it can meet the vaccine deadline” when it was at $55 it hit the deadline and their stock price went to $180...I was in Tesla at $200 (pre-stock split) when everybody said it it wouldn’t ever go back to $300, Teslas stock hit $2600. Now, everybody’s doubting Ride, saying it’ll never be worth anything OKAY, we’ll see how that’s going to work out. I bought Carnival Cruise when it dipped to $9 last year when EVERYBODY AGAIN swore up & down it’ll go bankrupt, it’s stock is back at $26+ a pop. Point being, shorts you’re literally never right. Short Term set back is literally nothing when the company is actually working towards something. Shit I was in QEP (Oil stock) after it crashed at $.40 a stock and PEOPLE again swore up & down it’s going bankrupt, now QEP is at $4+. When you know a company is working hard towards something revolutionary, it’s not a scam. It’ll take sometime, but this stock is easily $50+ stock I can just see it."
03/18/2021,stocks,"That is absolutely not true, if you fake pre-orders and lie to investors that is one hell of a crime, and since there is an sec investigation which is serious the sec is not something you mess with."
03/18/2021,stocks,Yea I don't agree with your statement on lordstown but that was so not a question lol
03/18/2021,stocks,No it wasn’t. But keep pretending...
03/18/2021,stocks,"LMAO dude still missed the point hahaha

as long as it doesn't go to $0, baghold for 100 years is okay.

Got it."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Problem is that even in the worst cases of fraud--let's take Enron for example--the shorters get rich and retail gets screwed. So investors lost 74 billion dollars and many basically had their retirement funds completely destroyed. Jim Chanos made 500 million. The same thing happens on a smaller scale every single time; the ""research firms"" or the people paying the research firm make out insanely well while retail (or even retirement funds) get hit hard. When the reports are basically fabricated, which they frequently are, stocks tend to rebound, so the only damage is to people who panic sell and lose 20-50% of their investment in that stock. So, even though it is correct that fraud is detected (or better yet protected) having vigilantes who channel money from retail into the ultra rich, often based on lies, is not a good way to do it.

As for the metaphor, I'm saying that if someone doing bad accidentally does something good it doesn't mean that they are good or of value to society. Of course, it isn't a perfect metaphor because it is unclear if the shorters actually do anything of value for society, whereas in my metaphor at least on that day the burglars do."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Because I've been around long enough when the shorts where the ones who exposed a company called valeant who was jacking up drup prices on patients up 700% or lehman brothers and many other firms such as enron, this notion that shorts are the only ones to gain from a situation is so nieve, it's also setting bad precedent for every new investor to just dismiss a short sellers report, imagine if people on here were investing in valeant a company who is jacking up lifesaving medicine 700% because shorts are evil"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Remember when GM went bankrupt? I remember. Might not be the best defense.

Go skim hindenburgs article. If only 25% of what they said is true, I would still stay far far away from RIDE.

As for OP, versions of this have been posted on multiple stock subreddits, he (and maybe others) are pumping the hell out of this. And he words it in a very manipulative way. I would not trust him either.

I won't comment on the what the stock will do, because Nikola still exists with a 6b market cap."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Hahaha now GMs stock is over $50+ ya the entire industry went bankrupt it wasn’t just GM. Like I would agree with you, but your point isn’t really valid because at that time when that happened there was a financial/economic crisis , entire industries were simply going bankrupt and GM was one of those because I also remember Ford, Chrysler/Dodge we’re going bankrupt as well."
03/18/2021,stocks,Dude there is a big different between taking the risk on tesla or what not and buying into a company actively under sec investigation
03/18/2021,stocks,Buy extra shares at 14 and sell it back to smoothbrains for 20 after it hits 22. Ye be doing Gods work that way. The lost can't be shepherded. Just keep taking their shares and call them stupid later. Personal favorite techniques of mine.
03/18/2021,stocks,"You’ve danced very far away from your statement from “They are going to ZERO” to “I don’t like the stock.”

Many people, including Anheuser Busch have not cancels their orders. And all of those cancelled orders are from the Short Seller attack on Nikola.

What lie has got you fuming the most? Seriously what lie makes them incapable of delivering a product?

Elon Musk was under SEC investigation, then shortly after skyrocketed his company to make him the richest man in the world briefly. SEC investigation isn’t a guilty plea or a company foreclosure.

You said ZERO... I can’t fathom how you take billions and go to zero with a competitive product in a growing market."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Enron went bankrupt - Chanos called them out on fraudulent accounting practices well before the bankruptcy. So in a way, he provided investors in Enron an early out. They were given a chance to get out before the company went bankrupt - without his reports how would they have found out? Enron was a huge house of cards that went on for years screwing over its customers and employees - had Jim not stepped in how long would that scam have continue to go on? 

The short attack on Enron took place over most of 2001, it was not an immediate one-off report that made the stock drop. Short sellers definitely need to be reigned in - no argument from me there. Most short sellers are shady actors - but how is that different from Chamath / Elon jumping in to try to pump GME or Dogecoin on Twitter to their thousands of followers? Both are forms of market manipulation and should be investigated by the SEC. But there have been short sellers that have uncovered some massive frauds that the SEC or any other governing body was obviously not able to uncover. So I think there is still a place for short-selling in the market."
03/18/2021,stocks,Ok well Lordstown isn’t valeant. They are in a different market and they are being very transparent and letting people know what’s going on. Hindenburg is just accusing them of lying. You can’t take any of that report seriously when Hindenburg supposed talked with e squared and quoted them saying they “never intended on ordering any vehicles”. After the fact E squared said they planned on fulfilling their order and they never said that. Until I see a report proving hard evidence to Hindenburgs claims I won’t believe them
03/18/2021,stocks,Ford never filed. One of the only ones that didn't
03/18/2021,stocks,"Oh, my bad, please keep telling me stuff. I am inexperienced and stupid. How many years have you been successfully doing this? 

Or are you just..........talking out your ass like most people here do? You're obviously new if you think the SEC being involved is just automatically bad and that its a rare event. Especially after a short report. 

I know you think you know what you're saying, but let me give some accurate context, saying the SEC is a big deal in this context, is like saying its a big deal a principal went into a classroom. See how ignorant that would be? That's you right now bud. 

But please, say SEC investigation another 25 times, maybe it will make a difference."
03/18/2021,stocks,"That lie that they said they have a working truck when they didn't, and it actually ran on gravity, or the lie that they managed to slice hydrogen prices or that they produced hydrogen at all, those lies."

But my advice drop it like it's hot no customer or serious investor will ever trust this company, things like this damage reputation forever"
03/18/2021,stocks,Also stop downvoting anything you disagree with it only hurts your credibility
03/18/2021,stocks,"All I’m saying is, RIDE is obviously working towards something critical, it’s going to establish it and it will start producing by September. It’s really not a matter of opinion anymore, it’s just facts. Betas are coming off the line, production line is running and their battery facility is operational. It’s all facts. They’re taking heat now mostly because of their non-binding orders, and how they didn’t address that as well as people wanted them too. But the fact is, as a company LMC is going to produce cars by September, GM is on their ass probably pushing hard for it hence why they spent 100M+ on re-tooling in just one year. If GM wasn’t a key partner with them, it’d be skeptical, but GM will act as their “supervisor” essentially to ensure they are operational soon. That’s why my hands and feet’s are in cold water, because GM is probably watching their every move, hence why they have a seat on the board. And YES I am 1000% sure GM will eventually acquire LMC, as a Local everybody kinda of knows that but ya LMC is going to be functional and productive, they have to be, GM won’t take anything less of that. My theory is Steve Burns is acting as a Construction & Production Manager for GM for the time being, once he completes the tasks at hand, he’ll move on to something else and GM will magically buy LMC out.

To back up my theory on GM buying back LMC is why the heck would GM start building a 3B battery plant right next LMC, like what are the odds right?? Just think about it, out of all the places in this country, they build the battery plant next to their soon functional plant."
03/18/2021,stocks,"The biggest difference between a pump and a short report is that it is a lot easier to make a stock fall than to make it rise (unless you tweet out something absurd like ""Funding secured"" , which was investigated by the SEC). A reasonable investor has time to confirm the reliability of a pump before deciding to invest, whereas with a ""short research"" you have already lost 20-50% before you even know of the report's existence. Given that these so-called research firms work with investment firms (and I don't know that they disclose which ones) the transfer of wealth from retail to big firms has likely already occurred by the time retail even knows of the report."
03/18/2021,stocks,"The problem with e squared is that it has one employee supposedly handling all of the company's pre-orders. Also that is why there is an sec investigation but you don't want to be the one holding after it is revealed they broke the law, just don't take this risk man"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Dude you are not only being an idiot but also setting a awful example for newer traders, if the sec is involved that is absolutely not a good thing at all, taking a Gamble on a stock you belive in is a whole diffrent conversation than actively buying a stock under investigation it is not normal at all don't know why you make it seem so and also you don't want to be that guy that bought nikola or enron worldcom at the top because unlike the market if these allegations are true it is not coming back."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I don’t know if you read my comment. But they do have a working truck... 

I don’t know if you know this, they do have cheap hydrogen, they get it from Arizona public service.

They have those things! You’re proving my point..."
03/18/2021,stocks,"It’s because it’s a lot like gas. Longer drive distances, smaller batteries and faster refuel times.

None of that leads to the company going to zero..."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Or, like most people’s predictions. Betting on a company going under isn’t all that likely..."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You know there was a pandemic right? Most people’s stock tanked 75% last year. Lmao...

You said ZERO. You think a $6 Billion company can’t keep its head above water to the point of complete destruction. It’s asinine.

I have no idea why you think a company will magically disappear to NOTHING."
03/18/2021,stocks,Lol. Are complaining about getting downvotes?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Your replies really just seem like defensive spastic retorts, and you aren't stating a single logical thing besides spewing slander, which is fine, but having no point, is not. Say something besides SEC investigation and Nikola and Enron. Make a point."
03/18/2021,stocks,"How many years have you done this? How many accounts have you blown? Can you name the criteria that triggers an investigation? Do you know how an SEC investigation unfolds? Im going to go out on a limb and say, you haven't been doing this long and you can't name any of the rest? Right?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"They said they produced their own hydrogen first which is a lie they can get hydrogen elsewherebut they said that they produced it which isn't true at all, and their working trucks break all the time as was the case when they showed the truck to cnbc. And haven't meet any of their deadlines while simultaneously releasing new renders of other products."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Dude, Nikola is the biggest piece of trash stock on the market right now, how it’s not at $0 already is a mystery."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Also forgive me if I don't believe anything that comes out of this companies mouth, also musk was under sec investigation because he broke the law so idk what that has to do with anything."
03/18/2021,stocks,In aggregate it's a bad bet. For a scam co? A high probability bet
03/18/2021,stocks,"Um what? Lol first most stocks are not down 75% as you have noticed also the drop was in June 2020 after the pandemic first crashed the market and by then it was in upswing, that isn't what going tobzero means God you are so uninformed when a company like enron which was a 60b dollar company got caught in an accounting scandal, investors started selling and soon lawsuits came our against the company and customers stopped trusting them and eventually they couldn't finance themselves so they went bankrupt, nikola is in a more dire situation because they don't have any sales and if the ev hype dies down they will go bankrupt fast."
03/18/2021,stocks,My Frontier Communications stock FTR went to zero and they still service shit tons of customers.
03/18/2021,stocks,I'm sorry but nikola dropped after the crash on March. Lmao...
03/18/2021,stocks,"It just shows how immature you are, I wholeheartedly disagree with you but I don't downvote"
03/18/2021,stocks,"My point is pretty clear that this is not about waiting and the,  language of the poor like you said, it's about not buying into a situation that has terrible risk reward, also I'm not spewing slander I'm telling people to avoid this entirely because that is the responsible and safe thing to do, just don't mess with a company accused of fraud."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I have been doing this for 4 years and no I can't name out all  of those things but in what world do you want to be inside a company that is accused of fraud and is currently under investigation, that is just a risk you shouldn't take, you don't need ro know the steeps of an investigation to know that is terrible risk reward"
03/18/2021,stocks,"The fact that it’s a “mystery” to you now says a lot about your forecasting.

Something can be trash and not go to zero."
03/18/2021,stocks,He broke the law but it didn’t send the company to ZERO like you claim is going to happen here. Smh.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Then your not using the voting system. Silencing your vote doesn’t do anything one way or another. Complaining about downvotes shows how immature you are and so does the name calling... smh. It’s pretty easy to not value that content.

Saying a company is going completely and irreparably bankrupt down to zero who has $800 million cash in hand and amazing prospects is wild. And you’re backed nothing up other than “SEC investigation!”"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Alright man, im tired, ive already blown the thread up enough. I'll give you the answer, the short report triggers the investigation regardless of the claims. Because it has to do with price manipulation. Have a good night. Do more research. Stop letting big players take your shares."
03/18/2021,stocks,You got a video of their working vehicles?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Dude you are so dumb, when one person is under investigation it is diffrent from when a company is under investigation, if a person like musk breaks the law he himself is punished and the company didn't do anything Wong, if a company is under investigation because they broke the law because they did do something wrong aka their reputation is gone, Jesus have people not learned anything from enron, or valeant and world com, don't touch companies who lie and break the law is it that hard."
03/18/2021,stocks,"How am I name calling you first, and second because as I explained when a company gets in trouble it needs to settle lawsuits and investors sell their stock and their customers don't trust them which eventually leads ro bankruptcy, that 800m dosnt mean anything if no one will buy your stock and your customers don't trust you, also 800m I'm cash is so little for a company worth over 1b"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Dude of course the short report triggers an investigation, and   from reading the shorts report you see that they have tons of evidence, this is a really terrible situation to buy into, this is again not about taking the leap and believing in something, if you buy in you are taking a massive risk that this could go down fast, you want to know why retail loses its not because of hedge funds or big guys its about not taking ridiculous advice like this, like its common knowledge not to buy into a company accused of fraud or is that the language of the poor as well?"

You can be under investigation and not send the company to ZERO. You seemingly don’t understand that. Smh."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You literally called me immature. Smh. Are you kidding me? That’s a personal attack. That’s name calling.

They can settle all of that and still have HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IN THE BANK. If there’s even anything to settle in the first place. Again, they have the working trucks and the hydrogen..."
03/18/2021,stocks,Sure would be nice seeing some sort of raw footage after it was found out this company is a little sketch instead of just promotional stuff. But hey if that works for you best of luck!
03/18/2021,stocks,"First Because it wasn't only Milton, it was the company itself, Trevor Milton didn't release that video of the truck rolling down on his own it was the company, also it wasn't just him that overstated many facts about the company, elon lied but that didn't actually affect the intrinsic value of the company and also that lie was very diffrent from Trevor's lies to begin with, lieing that you will take your company private while lieing about what your company can and is doing with its products is very diffrent because one affects only stock price while the other affects the whole legitimacy of the company."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Also yes and investigation can and will, enron and worldcom and they actually had sales they just overstated them while nikola dosnt even have the first part, they went to zero because after they were caught investors didn't want anything to do with them and their customers didn't trust them, plus lawsuits so they went into bankruptcy."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I called you behavior immature that is not a personal attack at all, also 800m is absolutely nothing and will run out fast if no one is investing and no one is buying"
03/18/2021,stocks,Probably running a nice diesel in them.
03/18/2021,stocks,They have a YouTube channel as well...

Not my behavior. **Me.** Don’t lie. It a bankrupt worth quality, right? You’re rewriting to save face.

$800 million is a lot of money for a company, especially one worth ZERO DOLLARS AND ZERO CENTS. Because you said that what it’s worth...."
03/18/2021,stocks,The unwillingness to accept any positive reality is an easy reminder for how asinine the ZERO dollar stock claim is. Reject anything that doesn’t fit your narrative..
03/18/2021,stocks,"That’s great... they also lied so to me that’s a massive red flag from a company that hasn’t even sold a truck yet. I have yet to see anything that reignites that trust. Especially after their CEO stepped down amid controversy. 

There’s too many red flags for me and promotional videos ain’t cutting it."
03/18/2021,stocks,"That's not what going to zero mean going to zero means bankruptcy which results in the companies demise, also I'm sorry with how I worded that I ment to say it shows how immature your behavior is."
03/18/2021,stocks,They’re advertising videos and they don’t have a good track record.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Cut it to what? Cut it to trust it won’t go to ZERO DOLLARS? It’s absolutely asinine.

It’s one thing to argue it’s not a good company, it another to pretend it’s only on a path is to bankruptcy without a doubt. Smh"
03/18/2021,stocks,It’s good if you to admit being wrong in this conversation and even if it was a backhanded apology where you continue to attack my character. Pretty immature attack of you still.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Cutting it for me to buy as I don’t believe there’s any value nor future value because of their BS. I will never invest in a company who had their FOUNDER step down amid fraud. That’s just asinine to defend.

If it works for you good luck."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Whatever I'm done, saying your behavior is immature is not an attack in any way and I'm sorry if you take it as one, I apologized for how you took my statement and if you still think the thing I ment to say is a personal attack idk what to tell you man."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I’m defending the notion it’s not a zero dollar stock and here everyone is standing up and saying it is.

Musk almost had to step down and now his company skyrocketed and he’s one of the richest men in the world. That’s not an excuse to me.

They said they had cheap hydrogen...they do now.

They said they had working trucks...they do now. Nothing anyone is claiming is enough for me to believe it’s a zero dollar stock.

Just wish people weren’t so shameless to admit that a far fetched claim.

“I don’t like the stock” is far different than “it’s with zero dollars and zero cents!”"
03/18/2021,stocks,I continue to look forward to all the non-zero days ahead. Apparently $0.01 expectation is all it takes to be bullish on NKLA.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I never argued it was worth $0 I was coming at this as a new investor having never touched them. Everything presented does not change my position that they aren’t worth it now. 

Musk got in trouble for tweeting not for lying about their product. Let’s not compare those two and that’s all the defense I’m giving to Musk."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Musk lied about taking the company private at a much higher price than they’re current price was at the time to elevate the stock price.

The whole origins of the conversation and even the thread you comment on was directly about Nikola going to Zero. The commenter before your first comment was a person saying it was a mystery who it’s not at zero already. Which I replied, then you jumped in.

They have $800 million, cash in hand. That’s not anything to be more than worthless?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Securities fraud and lying about products are different animals. I’m not defending musk anymore. I also don’t want to seem like I’m saying what Elon did is ok because it’s not but it’s just a different beast is all.

This is going to be a very long DD, but it has all you need to know about the [***Play Magnus Group***](https://playmagnusgroup.com/).

#1.Market
Chess is a unique and fascinating game in many ways, but most so in that it has a simple set of rules universally accepted across the globe. It essentially requires no more than a board and a few different looking stones, which makes it accessible to almost every person of every age on this planet. That already describes the biggest up- and downsides of it as an investment:

 ##Evaluation
You could say that the market is bigger than in any other industry. Not everyone who could, actually plays chess, but an estimated 650+ million people worldwide do, and surprisingly most still offline. At first it’s quite puzzling to think of ways to make money from it, since it's free for everyone and there is no form of copyright to the game. But the main point is that the money is not in boards and stones, but in the playing environment and more importantly the additional content available within this environment. As mentioned, the rules are simple but in the end chess is virtually the benchmark for [Bushnell’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushnell%27s_Law) of a game “easy to learn but hard to master”. Many people learn it just by playing, but if you really want to become a good player you need to seriously study games or get a professional trainer or both. And that is the selling point of a good contemporary chess venture which most people seem to miss:

- Chess playing and broadcasting websites create market reach – but not value! 
- Playing chess is free – but coaches and good study material are not!
- The online chess market is huge and still widely untapped!


#2. Competition:
There are 3 major chess websites worth the mention. When discussing the [*Play Magnus Group*](https://playmagnusgroup.com/) in forums like this, one of the first arguments always immediately popping up is that the company’s playing site [*chess24.com*](https://chess24.com/) (which I will discuss in more details below) is basically [shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/HikaruNakamura/comments/ldb3w4/i_mean_who_uses_chess24/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_source=share) and has no chance against the main competitors *lichess.com* and *chess.com*. I will not fight on this topic too much but will just highlight some points to spark your own thoughts:

- The preference for one site or the other is kind of subjective. Different people prefer different visuals/animations/sounds/etc. and also feel more connected to a certain user base to compete and socialize with. That is fair and should not be challenged too much.
- Lichess.com can easily be called the overall most appealing playing site. But it’s open source without any paid content (100% free) and as a charity ;) I will not consider it as a competitor for the relevant markets in this analysis, simply because the best content creators will only put in so much of their valued time for free.
- Chess.com is deemed the most successful – and I guess you could say “best” – chess website overall. It was the first one I signed up to years ago and it’s also the choice of 50+ million other users. It's by far the biggest playing community in the game. Many say it largely owes its success to the domain but I personally think that does not give the site enough credit. Surely the popular name was a factor initially, but the company did so many things right for so many years that you just have to admit it is undoubtedly a top address for chess which can be easily recommended to anyone interested in the game.
- Many chess players, myself and almost certainly the current top 20 in the world included, don’t just use one site, but at least two of them frequently.
- The market seems big enough for even more companies and good ideas and they will all help growing chess and increase each other’s success.
- Play Magnus is the only publicly traded chess company I know of.

##Evaluation:
Competition is good for everyone and will benefit the Play Magnus Group.


#3. Business (Brands and Services)
There is a lot to talk about but I will try to keep it as short as I can. PMG has grown immensely both on the organic and acquisition side in very short time. Their current business can be divided into the following sections, which together build an absolutely unique and harmonized ecosystem fueling each other, set up for significant growth:

**Play:** The company’s foundation and name patron is the [*Play Magnus app suite*](https://www.playmagnus.com/en), in simple terms a mobile game to play against machine versions of world champion Magnus Carlsen at different ages in his career. It has a related tactic trainer app and I believe the main app contains some interesting trivia about Magnus etc. I have to admit I have the least experience with this, since I prefer playing real opponents and also feel I would be too frustrated to constantly loose against a toddler or so. But the main app and the tactics trainer both have 1m+ downloads and a 4.2 star and 3.9 star rating respectively in the Play Store and I would say it’s one of the most innovative ideas to capitalize on the name of a famous chess player in many years.

**Watch:** [*Chess24.com*](https://chess24.com/) was founded in 2014 and acquired by PMG in 2019. While I have mentioned above that it has serious competition for playing, the overall opinion on the best watching experience of all available services is pretty much set, with chess24 being the premier broadcaster of many world class chess events with major partnerships and presence on tv, twich and youtube etc. If you want to watch a big chess tournament in your language, you will one way or the other be recommended chess24 at some point.

**Study and Learn:** PMG’s current driving force towards profitability and one of the main focus points for revenue acceleration is [*Chessable.com*](https://www.chessable.com/?page=landingpage). Co-founded by John Bartholomew, one of the first and most influential chess youtubers around, the site offers a one-of-a-kind learning platform and community with their science based learning software *MoveTrainer®*. You have to think of it like this: For decades players annotated and analyzed their own and other player’s chess games and extracted key positions and recurring patterns in order to collect and present them in a kind of analog quiz form in dusty books, for students to buy them and play through these lessons on a real board in long hours at home. Chessable.com is the polished digital 21st century version of this, refined to such a pleasing and simple user interface that any kid could learn with it, while having the feeling of directly interacting/chatting with a world class chess coach. For people who don’t play chess this may sound really nerdy and strange, but within the chess community things like these are regarded as an absolute game changer if not the holy grail of commercializing chess. When I started playing, online chess was already famous, but to learn my favorite opening the best I could find online was still a small private website with long annotation, text and some diagrams thrown in for all different variants. Today with a few clicks you have a chess Grandmaster video-teaching you the opening while you see the moves from famous examplary games played out on your screen, followed by an interactive quiz with encouraging comments for every correct or wrong move. It’s just nuts to me! And to emphasize the ecosystem aspect for you, in 2021 PMG has acquired the profitable company [*New in Chess*](https://www.newinchess.com/), world’s No. 1 chess book and magazine publisher and [*Everyman chess*](https://everymanchess.com/), another major publisher with the plan to integrate the best of their content into Chessable online courses. See, we speak about the rights to some of the greatest books and articles ever written by chess legends, waiting to be digitized and made digestible for the everyday chess Joe.

[*iChess.net*](https://www.ichess.net/), acquired in 2020, also focuses on the e-learning through video courses. Most of the above applies here too, so I will not repeat it.

[*Cochess.com*](https://cochess.com/) is another pillar in PMG’s strategy to dominate the market for professional chess training. You can select and book face-to-face chess lessons with one of the top chess coaches represented on the site. 

**Compete:** A real Pandemic-winner is the [*Champions Chess Tour*](https://championschesstour.com/), a series of 9 online tournaments throughout 2021 with 9 days of chess in each tournament and a historic prize fund of $1.5m fought out by the absolute world elite of chess. This is the second tour after the huge success of the first one in 2020. The PMG management continues to mention that the tour is not meant to be profitable (which I personally believe it actually is), but a catalyst for all other ventures of the Group. The concept is easy: tens of thousand of viewers drawn by the broadcast (peak viewership of the 2020 tour were around 200k viewers) get interested in the other great products of PMG and sign up for subscriptions. To finance the tour itself and increase its recognition the company partners with many fascinating names. The current 4th round is presented by [*Breakthrough Initiatives*](https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/) which is backed by Mark Zuckerberg and Sergey Brin. If you are already into chess or browsed reddit lately you may have seen the viral video of the [Bongcloud meme game](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/m5xzi1/magnus_carlsen_current_reigning_chess_world/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) between worlds No. 1 classical chess player Magnus and world’s No. 1 Blitz chess player Hikaru Nakamura, which happened in that tournament and got 1m+ views on Youtube in one day. It’s also really interesting to see how good the Play Magnus Group is in appealing to a new and young customer base e.g. with their great tour broadcasting team around the lovely Kaja Snare.

 
**Outlook:** Describing potentials which I personally see for the company but are not material at this point, would drift too much into speculation, so I leave that. However, seeing PMG partner with [BCE](http://www.bestchessmenever.com/) for the beautiful new Play Magnus chess set only adds one additional income source to my imagination. But I have to go deeper into one particular thing which is already announced and will be one of the most important generic projects for PMG’s future: As mentioned [*chess24.com*](https://chess24.com/) is the group’s website to play online against opponents around the world. For competitors as well as the public perception this is one - if not THE - major point for brand recognition and gaining customers. Chess24 is seen far behind in this category mainly due to their poor UI and too few variants and time controls. Few frequent players online at the same time mean you cannot easily get paired with another player of your strength and that results in mismatches or long waiting times, which is a death sentence for a game moving more and more towards faster time controls. On March 3, 2021 chess24 has finally opened the long awaited [new playzone](https://chess24.com/en/read/news/try-out-the-new-chess24-playzone) for their premium members, although the timing when it will be finally available to everyone for free is still unknown. Well, guess who already uses the new playzone since last year? Absolutely! The champions chess tour is played exclusively on the new software, which means the world’s top professionals are free testers for the project. I don’t want to exaggerate the effect, but to me this feels like having all F1 drivers test a new Porsche model for a year before bringing it to the market. You get the point! I believe the new playzone will be the Porsche among the online playing sites and my guess is that it will be released latest towards the end of the tour in September 2020 (but probably much earlier).

##Evaluation:
In terms of portfolio, there is no company in any other gaming field, which is better prepared to take over the huge market they compete in.


#4. Management and Ownership
Probably the part which I felt needed the least research after I saw how the company is managed from a strategical viewpoint. 

CEO Andreas Thome and CFO Dmitri Shneider convinced me in the presentation streams I have seen. They are straight forward about the company’s position and at the same time strike me as the kind of persons to not make any claims they can’t actually stake. Thome joined 3.5 years ago from Opera and Shneider left a strategic executive director position at JP Morgan to become COO at chessable before the acquisition by PMG. CTO David Kramaley came in as a co-founder of chessable.

The [Ownership Structure]( https://www.playmagnusgroup.com/investor/share-information ) is not too surprising. The 52.4m issued shares are listed on Merkur Market in Oslo with a current market cap of around $150m. Besides myself as a proud owner of a few pennies, there are of course some institutions/banks involved, while the founders of chess24 (9.5 %) and chessable (2.0 %) and obviously Magnus Carlsen (9.5 %) and his manager (2.0 %) seem to be the largest individual shareholders. It has to be mentioned that around 4.2m warrants were outstanding as per Feb 2021 which could move the price upon execution. I even believe this could be part of the reason why the stock is currently moving side-/downwards despite a very successful tour and positive financials.

##Evaluation:
I will probably take the shares to my grave, but anyone else is of course free to do what they want. The management to me is much above average for a company of this size.


#5. Financials
I have spent quite some time not only on all the above but also on the financials and I strongly suggest you look at this for yourself before you invest. With the size and age of the company the available data does certainly not allow a DFV-style valuation model. At a revenue of $7.9m in 2020 (vs. $2.9m in 2019) the company lost $16.0m (vs. $4.5m in 2019), mostly driven by non-recurring expenses e.g. for ramp up/hiring, acquisitions, share-based compensations, equity funding and exchange listing etc.  

At such a loss, PMG - similar to other growing tech companies - has to be measured by their growth rates, for which they use these KPIs:

- Bookings (revenue that has been paid or contractually agreed to be paid) is up 196% YoY to $9.26m in 2020
- Average Revenue Per Paying User (ARPPU) is up 30% YoY to $18.4 
- Monthly Paying Users is up 89% YoY to 44.3k

The balance sheet shows an almost debt free company loaded with cash ($35.3m; equals around 60 % of total assets) and intangible assets ($15m) which screams for more transaction announcements in the near future.

The officially communicated target is break even in 2022 and $60m+ bookings in 2025 (with the company overachieving all their quarterly targets in Q4 2020/21). At the current market cap this would value PMG at a revenue multiple of around x2.5. For reference: Pokerstars changed owners in 2019 for around x3 revenue while e-learning company Chegg currently trades around x30 revenue. I see PMG somewhere in between, with much room for phantasies.

##Evaluation: 
The company is healthy with a great plan. Obviously, financials (especially forward looking) alone are difficult to judge outside of all the context given above and I really recommended you make your own research here. 

#6. Momentum:
I guess even before times of retail-investor-driven meme-stock-markets, trends had to be part of the investment consideration, but today the influence of informed young minds is more important than ever. Chess has never had more steam with all the hype around Netflix’ Queens Gambit and the top reach on twitch where PogChamps and individual streamers like Hikaru with 1m+ followers brought it up to be (among) the top followed game(s) on the site. There are so many interesting and influential ambassadors for the game (just google the Botez sisters) which are as far from the dry image chess had for years as you could only imagine. The world chess championship in Dubai – the world capital of influencers – at the end of 2021 will pour more fuel into this. 

Finally I have to emphasize one important point in the context of the current attention for my favorite game: Many people think this trend – and with it, the interest in the game – will go away just as fast as it came. Now, I am a pretty average player and person but I believe chess is the most beautiful, interesting and entertaining game ever invented, and its unbroken popularity for centuries tends to support my belief. If people are like me, they will – once drawn in by its beauty – never drop the pieces again. If a guy who got hooked after watching [Fresh](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0109842/) in the 90s is still flame today, so will the gal who found chess for herself in QG2 in the 20s still be in in love with it in the 40s! There have been chess hypes before, but never did one company tackle the commercial side of the game like the Play Magnus Group does these days.

##Evaluation:
**For me personally, yes, I do find it's an attractive investment at this price point.**


This got even longer than initially expected. My last recommendation is: don’t spend money you don’t have based on strangers opinions on a messenger board. If you can’t afford shares, picking up a board and a few different looking stones or better registering for free to any chess website to learn the game is by far the better idea. I would even say it’s the best idea period! I am not a financial advisor so you should do your own due diligence before you blindly believe anything I said."
03/18/2021,stocks,"That's interesting. I prefer [chess24.com](https://chess24.com) but would never give them money.

Disregarding their competitor just because they're non-profit is a major mistake. It's a problem that they even have a competitor like that, it should tell you right away what anyone who plays chess should already know; chess isn't about capitalism."
03/18/2021,stocks,what is the symbol for it?
03/18/2021,stocks,I didn't realize Play Magnus was public. Chess has absolutely exploded in popularity this year and would be interested in getting in on this. Can't find it through Fidelity though.

Hi all

Long story short I am feeling particularly bullish on the future of green hydrogen and fuel cell technology. 

I have been putting together a pie to expose myself to as much of the industry as possible, please let me know if I am missing, or you would suggest any stocks? 

Currently got;

Plug, Ballard Power, ITM Power, Hyzon Motors, AFC energy, Nel, Toyota, Fusion Fuel Green 

Any others you could recommend? 

Thanks"
03/18/2021,stocks,So you're saying you think Hydrogen is about to blow up?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Have you checked out the new ETF HDRO? Might be worth checking out if you’re really investing in all those companies. 
My favorite is PLUG. They’re flush with cash and expanding domestically and overseas. They’re restating 2018-2019 financial statements which is never good news but it shouldn’t affect their growth targets moving forward. Now might actually be a good time to pick up some cheap shares. Good luck!"

03/18/2021,stocks,"I am in close contact here in Europe with a very central organization working in the field of fuel cells and hydrogen. It is definitely an interesting field and could be the future of power storage, but it is still at infant stage. The projects set up by the EC are pilots and pretty unprofitable so far. Also, there is not enough renewable power in the whole wide world to produce the green hydrogen needed for a country like Poland, Germany, France. Do not want to discourage you, but beware it will take a long, long time until this materializes..."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Hydrogen's real market potential is at least 5-10 years away.  

Hydrogen MAY turn out to be useful for a variety of hard-to-solve clean energy problems (seasonal energy storage, industrial process heat, long-distance transportation).  I say ""may"" because there are competing energy solutions (flow batteries, power-to-X, etc) and it depends which matures best. But all of these applications don't become relevant until we have a powergrid that is mostly running on renewables.  The market data tell us that we should be intensely bullish on growth in  renewable energy, but even the most optimistic projections say we're 5-10 years from the from the point where hydrogen is a useful complement. 

**What you're seeing right now is a hype bubble in hydrogen.**  From past experience we know that hype can translate to a huge future market... but usually only after the hype bubble collapses.  We saw this with renewables around 2011 and with Tesla a couple years back.  Great tech, but the market ran up the asset valuations before the sales and fundamentals were strong enough.

If you buy into hydrogen right now while the valuations are run up to high levels you will probably get burned.  If you want to make money on hydrogen stocks, then you need to wait until the valuations correct down to something more realistic."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Well Air Liquide just build the biggest  PEM- (Proton Exchange Membrane) electrolyser and now partnered with Siemens energy to work together in hydrogen research.  (beware the 2% tax in france for buying stocks)

There is also the German company ""Linde"", which is currently the biggest producer of industrial gases worldwide. When one company can do the whole hydrogen chain inhouse then it's them and they are also ramping up hydrogen. (but hydrogen will only be a small part of this company)

There is also Siemens energy, but I personally would rather go for something else, too new and too hyped at the moment.

IMO, if I’m grabbing like 4+ companies for a given sector, I usually just go the ETF route because I’m not sure which companies will emerge victorious at that point. If you’re confident that 1-3 companies will dominate, just consolidate around those.

03/18/2021,stocks,"ITM Power.. even though it has hit me the most in terms of losses (I bought at the peak). This company is a bit niche, in that it’s focused primarily on electrolysers, rather than fuel cell technology. It has big business partnerships.. Linde, Shell just two to name, but many others. It comes as no surprise the oil companies are taking an interest as they look to transition.  I think Plug has more going on, but this company is like a tenth of their market cap. Only criticism is they are fairly euro centric .. not much exposure to US markets but that could change. I don’t really delve into the financials .. but like most hydrogen stocks at this stage , I imagine not great."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Hey - thanks for that. And I agree, not expecting this to be a fast pay off. Probably 2030 is when we might begin to see things take off. Long run play... I’ve managed to buy things when they peaked and lost 10% in a day already haha ..

03/18/2021,stocks,"Hydrogen is a boom or bust investment - it’s very difficult to adopt it in real life so many barriers to entry adoption and infrastructure - I would recommend only investing in it short term and instead look to electric cars and related tech since they are a much better long term bet - less likely to blow up and destroy your portfolio - make sure you diversify so if the worst happens you won’t be caught with your pants down
- ark etfs are a good bet (though volatile) - disclaimer I don’t own any ark etfs as of today - also this is not financial advice I’m stupid - letting a smarter pants choose for you can pay off in the long run is what I think
- buying hydrogen stocks is like spending lots of money on lotto tickets - your odds are pretty bad in my opinion

With electric Elon made a catalyst with Tesla - boon in electric cars - reality - multiple companies pursuing it with great success.  

Hydrogen - no catalyst - people have been trying to make hydrogen a reality since the combustion engine was invented but we are nowhere near mass adoption."

I know you're using understatement and I've got the stock myself but it still made me laugh."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I still don't understand the use of transition or why hydrogen is big on the stock market at all.

It's just as temperature sensitive, has 2/5s the power retention (Energy produced versus energy stored) of a battery meaning it's not clean as a means to store the energy, the physical hydrogen has a logistics cost like fuel to a pump, a battery or supercapacitor could instantly devalue the decades of research into the tech...

I'm so lost as to why people think hydrogen infrastructure has a future outside of small regions of the midwest that are powered by renewables already. You'll be bag holders liable for the smallest innovation in a better tech."

03/18/2021,stocks,I saw someone the other day say that we could never use hydrogen because look how much damage the hydrogen bombs do. Nobody knows how to research shit these days.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Hydrogwn is great but all it takes is one minor incident for a big explosion, its like nuclear. 99% safe just doesn't cut it. In Sweden we've had trials with hydrogen busses but two years ago when one was in an accident the emergency servuces had ro evacuate a *whole city block* in case the battery had been damaged and risked an explosion.




It's fine for heavy machinery wirh few people around and low speeds. Its simply not worth it in everyday trafic due to the amount of morons driving as if they've stolen the car. One tiny accident, one crash going badly and the explosion will be frontage material for days (and everyone will scream at poliricians to ban ""bomb cars""). Imagine terrorists using it...it's a recepiw for disaster. I'm staying out until they produce one that litterary cant exolode no matter what...until then public fearmongering will kill it in its tracks."

03/18/2021,stocks,Is this in response to me? Because I was agreeing with you.
03/18/2021,stocks,I believe they are the number one hydrogen gas supplier in the world - primarily to chemical industry - but I expect some partnerships.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Glad to see some agreement here.  I think in this case it's not a matter of timing the market as much as looking at fundamentals and appropriate valuation.  

In the long-term, companies making electrolyzers and doing R&D in that space are by far the safest bet in hydrogen -- green hydrogen is a feedstock for power-to-X.  Fuel cells are a technology with an uncertain future; and it seems highly probably (though not guaranteed) that lithium ion batteries and solid-state batteries will kill any potential for fuel cell vehicles."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah I’m just saying if your into that many companies for a given sector, might as well consider a representative ETF. This one so happens to hold all of the companies you like, so that’s reassuring. ARK is totally different, that’s a bit more of a cult play on Cathie Wood’s judgement. I’m not gonna say they’re right or wrong but you’re buying into Cathie’s vision with actively managed funds."
03/18/2021,stocks,"there are several use-cases for hydrongen technology apart from automotive.

The most import one is probably that with hydrogen you can transport energy far easier over long distances. As a practical example: Germany is creating lots of wind energy in the north sea and is struggling to transport that energy to the south of the country (towns and cities don't want the power lines through/near their houses, it is expensive and difficult to build over long distances.

In this example, if you could create liquid hydrogen via electrolysis near the wind turbines, you could transport that with pipelines or even trucks over longer distances. At the destination the hydrogen could be converted back or just used directly as fuel."
03/18/2021,stocks,One Hindenburg and people are ...
03/18/2021,stocks,"Mainly because hydrogen can scale out and it is easier to retrofit current gas station to handle hydrogen.  The technology is already around for cheap locally produced hydrogen so long distance transport is not needed as much.

The problem with battery is neighborhoods are not wired to handle enough power if too many people get EV cars.  Not to mention all those apartments and cars in neighborhoods that park outside of a garage or on the street.  Charging takes too long if you need distance.

EV could possibly fix that if the manufacturers agreed on a replaceable battery program.  Then you could wire ""gas stations"" with high watt power, you drive in they drop your old battery, swap in  a charged one, and you drive off in under 5 mins.  The high power is needed so they can charge enough batteries to keep up with 15-20 cars every 10 mins like a current gas station or a hydrogen station could do."
03/18/2021,stocks,"All of these “hydrogen is stupid” comments are using the assumption that the tech won’t improve. Just because something isn’t possible now to be a major energy source, doesn’t mean someone won’t figure out how to make it so."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I did put a bit of research into this back in April, I only wish I had a brokerage account set up. Hydrogen has come along way, and Hydrogen fuel cells are actually considered safe. Unlike batteries which eventually go dead, fuel cells can continue to produce energy once fuel and oxidant is provided. As hydrogen is lighter than air, any leaks cause the gas to quickly disperse before any damage is caused. Right now, there are a lot of safeties that have to be built in, but given a couple years or so, I think Hydrogen will dominate the market, especially if it can be contained safely, or as safely as petrol. When oil becomes scarce, Airplanes will need a new supply to run off. Batteries just don't have the power for that. The best chance they have is with hydrogen, or maybe with methane. Anything with a high octane rating tends to be best"
03/18/2021,stocks,Shit.  Looks like my son got ahold of my wife’s phone again
03/18/2021,stocks,No. Apologies. Wrong thread
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yep.. that's why my favourite is ITM Power, though it has stung me the worst (need to stop looking at it in honesty). They have specialised in the electrolysis side, ignoring fuel cell technology. Lot's of business partnerships, particularly within oil (see Gigastack).  I'm probably over exposed to fuel cells, but I can't really find more stocks beyond ITM and Nel who are heavily exposed to the electrolyser business. 

Regarding fundamentals and evaluation .. most of these companies burn cash and it's quite hard to do financial due diligence as their valuation is based almost entirely upon potential growth."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Haha yeah I wouldn’t touch Noah’s ARK .. just an example. We don’t have access to as many ETFs over here. I’m not aware of any hydrogen ones, hence may need to rely on a pie. Looking to see if there is a way I can buy defiance’s ETF, but looking doubtful ☹️"
03/18/2021,stocks,"That’s the big point ..

I’m not really interested (at least short term) in its application for automotive. But it’s real value comes from the fact that renewable power cannot be stored easily. (LNG, coal) can be stored and converted as needed, however with renewables there are grid imbalances when demand is low and we are left periods of excess power (where it can trade at negative rates). With electrolysers, that extra power can be used to turn water into hydrogen, and ultimately convert to liquid hydrogen which can then be stored. Green hydrogen I think will see it’s initial growth in industry .. like steel producing and oil .. both currently use a lot of hydrogen. But it’s the only way to become truly carbon neutral."
03/18/2021,stocks,? Charge it at night ??? Hydrogen is super silly
03/18/2021,stocks,"We shouldn’t be assigning such a high valuation to companies dependent on multiple unsolved research problems, some of which have been worked on for a while.

1. Generating hydrogen from water is very energy intensive and is energy inefficient.
2. Generating energy from hydrogen involves efficiency loses.
3. Hydrogen is notoriously difficult to store and volumetric density is low. Liquefying or converting to ammonia to improve density and storage involves even more efficiency losses.

For hydrogen to succeed, these problems need to be solved."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Thermodynamics will be turning on its head to make its scale of efficiency worthwhile. Just because the market wills engineers to make it so, does not mean engineers will be able to make it so. This is a really old discussion & believe me, I want a hydrogen car. I just don't want it if that comes with infrastructure is actually less green than the pre-existing power grid.  


Hydrogen is only stupid if you feel like a technology & not a person can be stupid. I don't think that things are stupid, I think they're inefficient & unreasonable."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You're not reading in between the lines in what you're saying.

The expensive fuel cell is what degrades over time & Toyota to this date hasn't made a PEMFC feasible for manufacturing on a mass scale thanks to the cost of TITANIUM, this isn't something for nothing like entropy stopped for one unlimited energy process. They still lease their vehicles because warrantying them & allowing them for service isn't something they see in the market til 2030, which is why they opened to the Nikkei in 2017 for the first time in over 15 years. You're going long against the Japanese market.

Hydrogen is lighter than air, meaning it escapes virtually any container quicker than propane on a hot day, making its storage difficult & a constant loss no matter how well the system is designed. Further this makes logistics twice as difficult, should this storage not be resting right on top of the hydrolysis plant... which will inevitably only be green if it's right on top the renewable power plant...

No, it's not gonna catch on fire & burn, it's just less efficient & not any bit more temperature stable than batteries."
03/18/2021,stocks,No worries. You’re making you’re own ETF :) maybe you could even just look at their holdings and add if you’re interested; that would make your hydrogen portfolios more similar.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Ok I agree that hydrogen wind energy storage is a good candidate for the tech - but that’s not a catalyst - it’s a use case scenario for one situation that has other competing technologies such as battery and solid heat storage that are seeing wide adoption.  Sounds good on paper, but if it’s so great, then why isn’t it being adopted?  Because of costs and infrastructure.  Show me the Tesla of hydrogen tech and I’ll invest.  For now I think this is incredibly speculative and risky.  Though if it’s successful of course you’ll make money.  Who knows the future?  I sure don’t.  Caveat emptor."
03/18/2021,stocks,"It would be charge at night every other day based on average usage.  So you are still back to apartments, all those cars not parked in garages, and those traveling  so are you expecting all those building to retrofit with charging stations.

Then you have the problem that the amount of power needed by your average neighborhood if all those cars are plugged in they would exceed the amount that is brought into the area even if done when people are a sleep, which is not enough time to charge the batteries."
03/18/2021,stocks,Is your actual position that a battery is cleaner than generating or storing hydrogen?  Just trying to figure out your stance here.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Good points. I definitely don't think Hydrogen is a fuel we'll be seeing in use by next year, maybe not even in 10 years, although something has to change. Ya, electric cars are good, but planes can't run on kerosene forever. I think we will see a big push towards hydrogen, or maybe methane over the next century, its just a matter of when. Ya, there are a lot of issues, but hydrogen is progressing at a pretty quick rate. With so much investment given by retail investors and the like, I find it hard to believe this won't accelerate the move towards more renewable sources of energy, hydrogen being one of them."
03/18/2021,stocks,I don't believe battery technologies are actually competing with hydrogen as an energy storage tool. They kind of do different things. Battery storage is much shorter term than storing energy in Hydrogen. It's tricky to use batteries to combat seasonal changes in demand. Whereas hydrogen electrolysis combined with underground storage could be ideal for this.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Both, more energy gets from the power plant to the motor in a traditional battery powered electric vehicle compared to just the process of hydrolysis without even considering then using the hydrogen & it is ridiculously difficult to contain & move liquid hydrogen.

Also the mining for the fuel cells isn't exactly better than the mining for batteries, especially with the advent of Cobalt free batteries reaching production in China by 2022."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Planes will never be able to run on any kind of electric or electrochemical energy at higher altitude, you'll be seeing literal rocket science, like Methane engines from the SN series of rockets that SpaceX is testing.

I've wanted a hydrogen car since Pop Sci Kids said I could have one by the time I was 17 about 20 years ago. Good luck. I still want one, but not really."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Elon disagrees with you - he’s building a huge battery in Texas for energy storage to help mitigate weather related power outages and increase grid efficiency.  Also ceramic bricks are being used in energy storage systems for off peak heating, which is where 40% of power use in a grid goes.  

There are many other energy storage solutions and hydrogen is one that is being implemented - I don’t dislike the tech - I think it’s very smart.  I like hydrogen.  It sounds great on paper.  The issue is the infrastructure necessary to store, transport and convert it for wide adoption.  Of course it’s already been used in fusion cells, buses, etc but it’s a tiny drop in the ocean right now.  How fast do you think this will realistically grow in the next 10 to 20 years without a catalyst?  During that time, what will happen with the competing energy storage solutions?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I don't think he neccassarily disagrees. ""Weather related power outages"" are still short term and the battery in South Australia  was built to combat change in daily demand, which is again is short-term. One figure I keep seeing is that batteries can store energy for around a month. This isn't long enough to combat seasonal cycles. This could improve in the long-term though! I guess my thoughts aren't really about how stocks can grow, but about what is needed if we want to rely solely on renewable energy. Without long-term storage we will still need either biomass or fossil fuels combined with CCS to deal with the seasonal ramp up and down of energy production. This or perhaps modular nuclear power. There are alternative energy carriers to hydrogen though. Ammonia and methane are also talked about. Obviously with methane again you would need CCS for the conversion back into energy via a natural gas power plant. Although many countries already have great natural gas infrastructure."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Batteries on a power grid would easily fix the issue and would last many years - even though lithium cobalt cells have limited charge cycles Tesla has made them last effectively for the life of the car.  Lithium iron and lithium titanate are following closely behind and the latter has basically almost unlimited charge cycles (greater than 20,000 charge cycles, or 1000x the longevity of current lithium cobalt cells - something like a 100 year life cycle if used in a big enough cell matrix).  Lithium iron cells are already being used in Chinese Tesla’s (which the western world scoffs at cause they don’t understand how much better they are even with the reduced range) 

It’s only a matter of time before every home has solid and or battery energy storage systems with energy efficient hvacs(made by Tesla and competitors) Intelligent energy usage systems in a smart home would also store energy  in your car’s battery and use it in your home when it knows it won’t affect your typical driving pattern usage.  All of these competing techs have catalysts accelerating their development and adoption. 

The good thing about investing in hydrogen is that you are directly contributing to the technology’s development and adoption.  If money is not your end goal then I applaud your avant garde efforts, and wish you luck.

I for one, want to have portable fuel cells that are so small compact and efficient that they make lithium batteries look like caveman age tech.  I want it - unlimited power!!

I also want hydrogen to replace all fossil fuels, for it to be widely adopted.

But the safety implications of widely adopting hydrogen as a common fuel is many decades away in my opinion.  It’s something I don’t think I’ll personally see in my lifetime, unless a catalyst that catapults the technology happens in the near future."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I think over the years the safety implications of using hydrogen have been overstated and in reality it isn't so different from natural gas in that respect. For me, one catalyst could be the willingness over governments to decarbonise natural gas. This can be done via steam methane reforming + CCS and the cost of this is much cheaper than producing hydrogen from electrolysis. Obviously, in 100 years we would rather rely on electrolysis from renewables, but in the short-term I think this is where much of our hydrogen may come from. In this respect, certain oil and gas companies can be seen as an investment in hydrogen, since its these companies who own the natural gas fields, the CO2 storage sites, and the IP for some of the cheapest CCS technologies."
03/18/2021,stocks,Ok imagine this : imagine what would happen if natural gas exploded when it mixed with air.  Picture it.  Hydrogen explodes when mixed with air.  Hydrogen is no joke.  People are dumb.  Gas leaks happen everyday all the time.  It takes a spark or a flame and lots of concentrated natural gas to make an explosion - natural gas is several orders of magnitude safer to handle than liquid hydrogen.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I mean the lower flammability limits of methane and hydrogen are 4.4vol% and 4vol% respectively. And the autoignition temperatures of both are around 600'C. So the concentration and temperature you need for an ignition are virtually identical. However, hydrogen is flammable to much higher concentrations, so there is that.  The heat of reaction of the combustion of hydrogen is also lower than methane on a volumetric basis. I would say they are both extremely dangerous. But there engineering guards we can use make both safe."
03/18/2021,stocks,"NASA disagrees with you:

Hydrogen has a very broad f lammability range—a 4 percent to 74 percent concentration in air and 4 percent to 94 percent in oxygen; therefore, keeping air or oxygen from mixing with hydrogen inside confined spaces is very important. Also, it requires only 0.02 millijoules of energy to ignite the hydrogen–air mixture, which is less than 7 percent of the energy needed to ignite natural gas. That is why a burn pond using a 1-in. water seal was considered safer than a flare stack. Experience over the next several years showed us that keeping air out of the vent system was difficult and required strict procedural control and maintenance.
More often than not, fears about the potential for explosions were justified. Designers at Kennedy Space Center were concerned about using a hydrogen flare stack to manage waste hydrogen because they believed air could enter it and lead to an explosion. During the developmental testing of the SII stage of the Saturn V moon rocket at the Mississippi Test Facility (now Stennis Space Center), their concern was validated."
03/18/2021,stocks,"That isn't disagreeing. I did say I thought hydrogen was very dangerous. But there are engineering controls you can use to make it safer. Storing hydrogen is very different and much easier than flaring it, which is what your paragraph there is discussing. Industry already uses hydrogen for some things and other dangerous gases like ethylene. At the end of the day yes we may need to spend slightly more than we do for natural gas to make the infrastructure safe, but it is doable. At the end of the day with climate change we need all feasible solutions to stick to 1.5'C of warming and even with the extra expenditure needed to make hydrogen safe it will still be cheaper than alternatives for certain functions. Heavy goods vehicles, seasonal energy storage, low carbon aviation/shipping hydrocarbon fuels when coupled with DAC. Hydrogen will be part of the future at some point!"

2021-03-18 03:55:47,stocks,"Now is a great opportunity to go long $TLT As the title indicates, I believe now is a great time to start building a position in the twenty-year Treasury ETF, ticker $TLT.

This is not a revolutionary idea--probably because I am not a financial advisor, and my thoughts on capital markets should not be misconstrued as investment advice. I am, however, a businessman. As a businessman, I have experience doing business things. It might therefore be pertinent for you all to consider my thesis, for academic purposes at the least.

The last month or two have been, hm, shall I say humorous. Gracefully, I held my tongue as the entire market flipped out about rising treasury yields. Why was I calm amid sharp equity selloffs, rocketing yields, and talk of damaging inflation?

Because a) we've heard this story too many times before, b) not mutually exclusive from a), Jerome kept on trying and trying to tell everyone that rates wouldn't rise for the foreseeable future, and c) this inflation story has not only been bandied about like folklore, but furthermore, all the while, *we've failed to even reach minimum inflation targets*.

Today, we finally heard from our great Teacher, JPow, who reminded the kids that the rules still apply. And what are the rules? Keep printing money and keep rates rock bottom low.

I do not for one moment buy that the unprecedented printing of money, in the face of an unprecedented halt of the entire economy, will cause problematic inflation. Also, in the end, Treasuries are not absolutely tied to the Fed's overnight rate; the demand for Treasuries is what decides the price and therefore yield of said Treasuries. We've just seen one of the biggest selloffs in Treasuries since 2018 (and the very early days of last Feb./March, until the bond ETFs regained sanity and there was a flight to safety). I don't see yields rising more, becoming totally detached from the Fed rate.

For thirty years, bonds have raged bull-wise. I don't see that ending when money is cheap as ever. 

If anything, I see markets settling on cyclical, strong balance sheet equities. Even that, however, is a stretch for me. FANGMAN is about as cheap as it's been in a while. Facebook is ridiculously cheap. Amazon doubled earnings expectations recently and wasn't even rewarded for it. Semiconductors are brimming with demand. Financials are on fire. Airlines and cruises and live events and etc. etc. are preparing to come back with a vengeance. People are buying Bitcoin as if it were gold circa 1849 for Christ's sakes. We're just entering the biotech and clean energy age, even if it's still fledgling and speculative.

Moreover, we've just finished off a HUGE Treasuries selloff. It's not about where we are now, but where we were relative to recently, and with rates still near zero and the economy ready to explode, I simply don't see a reason to seek shelter; bonds will remain strong as a speculative device, as it is in all bull markets. (Bond prices don't rise because your grandma bought you a couple 20-year Bills so you could make $500 dollars when you turned 21. They rise because institutional investors are trading them.) We'd have to see a serious extension of the recent selloff to justify the velocity of Treasury yields--which have already slowed significantly since the latest growth/tech correction. **Oh yeah, and the Fed is still buying Treasuries...Lots and lots of the every day all day from sunrise to sunset and maybe still in the night when no one is looking.** 

For a while now, institutional investors have been short $TLT (lots of put buying as well). Last August, I held the same thesis, didn't have the confidence to follow through, and shed a single tear for each day that passed as a phenomenal opportunity passed me by. Rates had nowhere to go but back up. Especially mortgage rates had gotten out of control. But this is exactly the overextension I was looking for. This is, potentially, an equally profitable opportunity on the upside.

The beauty of this trade is, you can also use this as a mechanism to hold cash for future buying opportunities, keeping it low risk. For example, say you park 10% or so in $TLT. Say it continues dropping for a bit longer. You can sell calls, collect the dividend, and keep your basis down until it turns around again. And if it stays flat, fine, either take the premiums or collect the small interest.

If you're speculating, I think calls are a decent play but not quite yet. Premiums are high as a result of the recent selloff. Personally I think shares are the way to go until IV drops as things stabilize.

I'm going to start building a position slowly as it continues dropping--about 1-2% as a nice foundation, then about .2-.5% every week or two after that. Then, when it begins to flatten out and reverse, start buying more aggressively and discontinue my short call program, until I reach about 10% of my portfolio. I'll then keep it at 10% moving forward, rebalancing when opportunities arise or more cash comes in from the 'ole 9-5. (Perhaps here I should note for the record that I am a contractor and freelance in a number of areas, ranging from business development consulting to freelance writing.

That is all."
03/18/2021,stocks,"First, as another poster mentioned, TLT is not 10 years.

Second, while I don't have a crystal ball, you timing on this is likely *horrible*. The likely reason yields have been rising in due to the expiration of the SLR exemption for Tier 1 capital that was but in place last March, combined with the massive influx of cash deposits into the banking system due to stimulus checks. Given that the Fed didn't signal that they were going to extend this exemption or otherwise implement some form of yield curve control, there is a *very*, *VERY* good chance we see yields absolutely skyrocket in the coming weeks.

Again, I don't have a crystal ball, so I'm currently straddling TLT. But doing a long treasuries play right now, without *at least* hedging your position, is just asking to lose all your money.

Edit: I said *the reason yields are rising* and as pointed out in the reply, I should have said *the likely reason yields are rising* as this is something I don't know for certain."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Just so you know, TLT is not the equivalent to 10 year Treasuries.  The weighted average maturity is 26.18 years.  Its benchmark index isbthe 20+ year Treasuty index.

As far as I am aware, the only ETF with a higher duration is EDV ehich I made a lot of money eith back in the early 2000's.

By the way, I kind of agree with your premise that we wont see rates go much higher but I see lots of holes in your reasons.

Bond yields are not, as you say,  determined by the Fed.  Yields instead are determined by thr market's inflation expectations.  You can see the market is not anticipating inflation in the current negative yields of Tips bonds.
You.might want to look at IEF with a weighted average maturity of 8.53 years.  The benchmark fornthis is the 7-10 Year Treasury Index."

Edit: though I'm not sure good enough just yet to jump in, I will be keeping an eye on it. The higher yields rise, the more attractive it has to look for foreign investors as well."
03/18/2021,stocks,"My long term view is pretty aligned with the fed, in that inflation and rates will stay low for a long time.

However, we haven’t seen the short term inflation spike of a re opening yet. Traffic here in LA has gone back to 75% the pre-covid level in just the last two weeks. Movie theatres opening in a week or two here.

My point being, the effects of pent up household savings plus the recent stimulus have NOT been felt in the economy. We will really only see this in the next 3-6 months.

My guess is we might actually see 3-5% CPI for a short time as household savings trend back to the normal 8% or so, but it will normalize quickly."
03/18/2021,stocks,Don't mean to shift topic too much but how far out are you selling the covered calls and what strikes? The premiums don't look that juicy from a quick glance. I'd be curious what your thoughts would be on accumulating shares on something like pltr and selling covered calls. There is some real nice potential there if you believe in it long term. Asking this in the sense of best use of capital when comparing trade opportunities.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Great thesis and write-up, thanks for sharing. Some street analysts have been echoing this - Starting earlier this month saying to buy TLT/10-years aggressively. I think you're right.

Curious to know though - You say you're a contractor amongst other things. Building products have been starting to rise and many in the media point to this as evidence of inflationary pressures. Have you seen this anecdotally in your day-to-day?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Nice write up. Got stopped out off TLT once it broke that 2 year support line around 138. I like it because it provides decent risk reward and is a nice contrarian hedge from the widely held inflation thesis, so long as you enter cautiously since its not clear the bottom is in."
03/18/2021,stocks,"If you want to hold it for less than a year, use ZB instead, that's the 30 year treasury future.  You can also use ZN which is the 10 year. These give better taxation if you win - 60% LTCG, 40% STCG.

I also dislike this trade lol. It may work, but economy may beat to the upside on massive productivity growth, which will send rates up. Long stocks win in that scenario still."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You don't go long treasuries when rates are near all time lows, definitely not now.

Why would you expose yourself as retail investor to long term rates only , rates going up would totally wreck your position"
03/18/2021,stocks,"This was put in place as a safety measure. When it was put in place it was assumed that there was a potential for unstable markets for an extended period of time. This is NOT the case AT ALL. 

Furthermore your opinion is just that—an opinion. There’s nothing even resembling a consensus on this. Yet you mention this as if you have conviction. As you said, you don’t have a crystal ball. But there are just as many saying this will relieve pressure on bond markets. 

And yes, it’s the 20 year. My bad. Fixing it now."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Also another thing is, volatility would increase premiums on calls. That’s literally a hedge. Maybe not enough for you but you’re on the other side of this trade."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yes this was a typo. It’s fixed. 

If you pin it on inflation expectations that’s all the more reason confident: this is a short term outburst that came out of nowhere except an extreme extrapolation of some analysts. It’s hardly the sort of data the fed would use, and they responded accordingly. 

For what it’s worth, bond yields are still highly correlated. If people flock to an inflation thesis and therefore safety they’re expecting higher rates at some point. Obviously not totally connected but it plays a role. 

But more than that, inflation is not even close to the sole determinant of bond prices. Bond prices are determined by demand for bonds, and inflation is just one reason for demand in bonds.

However I think your reasoning is very sound. I’ll take a look at that. The inflation expectation would be in that time range. Wouldn’t the five year be in that range as well? $IEI Is within range of you buy that thesis. For me however the twenty year is free of that so all the more reason why rates should fall."
03/18/2021,stocks,Yeah I mean if I had respect for his opinion at this point I’d take it. Too bad he’s been calling for a permanent crash for a decade now.
03/18/2021,stocks,I have no idea what you just said. But I think you’re implying that I would be committing my money for 26 years. That is not how this ETF works. It’s 100% liquid.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Sounds like you sold for a loss. Other than that, how would you know when they are Peking? If you knew that you’d be a billionaire."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I mean the dude is acting like it’s a no brained play but he made almost 4,000% on his calls on, and this is his quote, “The biggest move in bonds in the world.” 

I would bet you my entire account on 100% leverage that there will not be a move even resembling that anytime in the foreseeable future. 

The ghetto spread idea is alright but nothing too revolutionary. He’s just selling covered calls really."
03/18/2021,stocks,To be fair it doesn’t really matter how much it’s dropped. The upside on treasuries is actually far less than the downside. Rates can only go so much lower.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yes someone else here was saying that it could get volatile. Where we differ (them and I) is that I don’t really mind the volatility as long as in the long term the position turns out well. For example, if I keep selling calls and adding very slowly until the trade starts going my way I could easily end up way out ahead as I aggressively ramp it up as rates reverse. 

And I still don’t think rates are necessarily going to keep climbing. Even with the inflation thesis, the same characters were saying the same things back in 2008. It’s my prediction that things will turn out very similar. Obviously that’s where we disagree but even if you’re right I do think it will be short term like you said."

03/18/2021,stocks,"I agree with you, but it isn't *just* an opinion. It's an educated opinion that *fits the evidence*. Can you offer me another valid explanation as to why yields have skyrocketed so much is the last few months aside from the SLR Tier 1 exemption expiring and massive amounts of deposits incoming from stimulus checks resulting in banks dumping treasuries to come into capital requirements? I'm not saying there isn't one, but if you can't offer (and especially one that is bullish for treasuries from this point on) then you should really re-consider this position. If you have one, I would like to hear it.

And I'm not on the other side of calls, I'm literally playing volatility by straddling because I didn't know what the Fed would do today. However, in the absence of another explanation of why yields have been rising, the lack of continued SLR exemption and YCC is extremely bearish for treasuries in the short term. Additionally, increase in premium due to vol isn't really a hedge, it's a gamble. If yields rise, you won't see an increase in value of your calls due to volatility, they'll just lose their value.

However, I am bullish on treasuries long-term. Unlike most, I think we're in for a wild deflationary ride, with serious market and liquidity issues in the near future, which I think will cause another flight to safe capital."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Im not sure what you mean by the 20 year is free of all that.  If you mean inlation, then noiy is not.

In any given year bond yields move a lot.  It is normal.  Even thoigh inflation numbers are not anywhere near as volatile, you see fairly large yield changes.  Those changes are amplified as you go out in duration.

Ten year Tnote yields have been in a downtrend for 40 years.  Their 40 year trendline is parallel to the onflation trendline.

The upper bracket ofbthe trend channel is at 3%.  The lower end is at 1.25%.  From that perspective, the anomoly was the fall in the yield to 0.50%.  

We have corrected back into that long term channel, but the high side is still 3%.  It is not all all unusual to traverse the range in any given year.   So even if the 10 year moves to 3%, it still doesnt demand the inflation rate increases.

But a move from 1.5% to 3% would cause 10 year prices to fall by almost 25%.  That is not a risk free investment."

03/18/2021,stocks,"We had just rolled a huge 401(k) Dec 2019.  We were just investing it in Jan/early Feb 2020.  The bond portion went up 7-8% within a matter of 5-6 weeks.  I told my advisor I wanted to sell them all and go shopping because by March 17th everything was on sale.  The timing couldn't have been better.  My advisor said no because of our financial situation and the VIX.  I still disagreed.  I took what cash that wasn't invested yet and bought airlines, restaurants, cruise, oil, all sorts of stocks.  I watched those bonds go down over the past 10 months to either where they were or below.  When I met with the finacial advisor, he again said bonds and in particular, TLT is where I want to be.  I told him when I open my porfolio I hate 2 holdings, TLT and EDV.  As my brother who works in the bond market told me bonds is not where you want to be right now.  And he related it to every 10 years it works.  I continued to see them drop even on a big market drop, gold, silver, bonds, stocks, nothing was safe, it all dropped.  I dumped all my silver and still have some gold and got rid of every single bond. I had 2-5 year, 10 year, 20+ year.  I got rid of them all.  The thing my brother did was actually buy the bonds.  He bought, I think AA.  That has a huge rate and as the rates dropped the value of the bond goes up.  Maybe you want to own the bond(s) itself, because they are paying a great rate.  I bought some LQD and plan to add more, even so, down 5%.  I think there is a time to own TLT but I would go back in when rates are much higher.  And I get it you are writing covered calls and using options to shore up or improve the position or hedge against the position.

> Volatility is not risk. People who think that are emotional about investments.

Volatility is *always* risk. Volatility is the entire market, especially when you are playing options. When the market doesn't change as much as you anticipated, that's volatility risk. When the market changes more than you anticipated, that's volatility risk. Everything about options pricing is literally the market pricing volatility.

> What other explanation do you want? I’ve laid it out for you above. I think you just disagree.

To be abundantly clear: I am honestly in agreement with you that we are not going to see inflation, and that treasuries will skyrocket in the future. We are of the same mind on that. However, I believe your *timing* is absolutely horrible. But if you have a case as to why this isn't true, I would honestly like to hear it. To re-iterate what I previously said, what I believe your analysis lacks is an explanation as to why yields have risen since the beginning of the year that offers a short-term flat or bullish perspective on treasuries. Short of this, I don't believe putting money in treasuries is a good idea at the moment, as the explanation that seems the most plausible at this time is that banks are dumping treasuries to come into compliance with SLR. Given that the Fed is not extending this exemption, or implementing ycc, and that we are about to see a massive wave of customer deposits, if banks have been dumping treasuries because of SLR, then we are *almost certainly* going to see them dump a *massive* amount of treasuries to come into compliance with SLR in the near future. If this explanation as to why yields has been rising is correct, then your bullish case does not hold. If the fact that the Fed is buying treasuries is bullish and will cause yields to go lower, then why have yields been getting higher for the last 3 months? If you don't accept the SLR explanation, then what is the explanation? Because without this explanation, you don't have a case."

03/18/2021,stocks," My understanding is that banks needed to hold treasuries as collateral against lending. Banks had been buying up bonds to increase their collateral so that another financial crisis didnt occur and they could bail themselves out with the collateral instead of taxpayers. Lending was tight, so When covid hit, the fed wanted banks to increase lending to businesses and households to survive, but banks didnt want to because it was risky. The fed suspended the SLR (well, they excluded treasuries from the SLR) so that banks would lend more easily and people and businesses could extend credit lines.

Banks started selling the treasuries TO THE FED, via QE, and used the capital to lend.

SO, when the SLR suspension expires, and SLR is in effect, banks need to start holding more capital and tighten lending. They will need to hold more collateral aka bonds. Banks will be buying bonds up like no tomorrow to get back to the regulations of the SLR, as well as to cover the expanding balance sheets from the stimulus package

Yes, basically.

> Banks will be buying bonds up like no tomorrow to get back to the regulations of the SLR, as well as to cover the expanding balance sheets from the stimulus package

No, it's the opposite. In terms of SLR, treasuries are consider *risk weighted assets* not *capital*. Just like banks have to have a certain amount of capital relative to their loans or customer deposits, banks have to have a certain amount of capital relative to the treasuries they hold. Capital this instance would be actual cash on hand, money via stock holders, etc (you'd have to read about the specifics, I honestly don't know or understand all of them). Treasuries are considered a low-risk asset similar to a high-quality loan or a AAA corporate bond."

Shadowing them but with modified weighting loses, because at this point, the share price of the underlying tracks ARK, rather than the other way around, so anything they promote will be a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Pair trading known good fundamentals against sketchy microcap doesn't work in either direction, for the same reason as above, because you're still effectively just playing a half-contrarian derivative of ARK's trading/marketing decisions.

As for full-contrarian against the funds, I don't think anyone except a fellow billionaire has the capital to ride out that bet.

So that leaves just buying the funds direct, which means you slowly bleed to management fees, and live knowing that the music is going to stop at some point, whether it be natural flat performance following saturation/maturity, or disruption by an opposing force, either one leading to an inevitable mass-evac event, to the likes of which we got a preview of a couple weeks ago."

I understand your point, but I do still think you're talking about timing the top. In your example, you describe buying ARKK at $121 and basically stop-lossing at $165, but in doing so you're still effectively making a judgement call that $165 is the 'top', albeit localized to your personal exit strategy.

I'd agree that is a great strategy if you're looking at fundamentals and valuation from reasonably tangible business operations and macroeconomic conditions. Problem is, we've blown past that point several times over by now and are in speculation fantasy-land. So if the concrete numbers would estimate the top for ARKK's holdings should have been, say, $40, no amount of research will give you a well-calculated exit target from where we're at now.

 BT Gains After Bagging 5G Airwave Capacity in Auction -- Market Talk

6:18 am ET March 17, 2021 (Dow Jones) Print

1018 GMT - Shares in BT Group top the FTSE 100 risers, up 5.5% after the U.K. telecom secured several chunks of 5G airwave capacity in an auction staged by U.K. communications industry regulator Ofcom. BT's EE, Hutchison 3G UK, Telefonica UK and Vodafone bid for airwaves across 34 ""lots"" in an auction of 200 megahertz of spectrum, Ofcom said. EE won 2x10MHz in the 700MHz band for GBP280 million, 20MHz in the 700MHz band for GBP4 million and 40MHz in the 3.6-3.8GHz band for GBP168 million. ""That will help BT to expand its position as the U.K.'s market-leading 5G network,"" says AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. (philip.waller@wsj.com)"
2021-03-18 03:18:17,stocks,"Just increased my positions in Big Tobacco. Update post here.  This one will be short and less data-driven.  If you want the original, detailed DD with numbers and facts, check out my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loygiq/why_i_just_went_long_on_big_tobacco/).

**Rationale**

I bought into Big Tobacco a month ago because I saw a safe mid-to-long term investment there.  People have been saying tobacco is on the way out for decades, and yet here we are.  Smoking is decreasing and becoming more regulated in the first world, but it's actually increasing quite rapidly in emerging markets.  I don't see it going away in at least the next 30-40 years, and there's been data to support that.  Again, check my original post if you're interested in that data.

I've invested modestly in a retirement fund IRA over the past few years, but this February marked my first foray into a more personalized and perhaps even ""aggressive"" investment approach.  I had a lot of cash on hand and while there's certainly an argument to be made for dollar cost averaging, I was kind of eager to start investing and decided to pull the trigger on some sizable (for me) investments.

I saw that a lot of the market seemed to be, IMO, overheated.  Will the bull run continue?  Maybe.  I don't know.  But with the P/E ratio the S+P 500 is trading at right now, I do reckon I'm a bit late to it.  So I didn't want to dump too much into tech or growth stocks... too risky at this point.  Especially for me because I'm not sitting on huge amounts of cash.  I did put some in MSFT and AAPL, and also BABA.

The largest portion of my portfolio, however, was and is in Big Tobacco.  I've got the 5 biggest tobacco companies (MO, BTI, PM, JAPAY, IMBBY), as well as the largest grower (UVV) and two accessories / smokeless brands (SWMAY and TPB).  I like some more than others but decided to diversify in everything in order to hedge against any total losers.

Last night I decided to paper hands BABA for a minor loss because I don't think I was fully aware of the risks involved with China when I bought in.  Still an amazing company and possibly worth the risk, but I'm somewhat risk averse so it just doesn't make sense for me at the moment.  I used the proceeds from that sale to increase my positions in Big Tobacco.

&#x200B;

**Updates on my positions:**

**Cigarette companies:**

Altria (MO) is my #1 tobacco position by just a tad.  I like the way they're positioning for cannabis and legalization in the US, something that I missed in my original DD.  They also seem to be trading well with a lot of possibility for growth.  Did not YOLO into them because they only serve the US market, where cigarette consumption is declining.

British American Tobacco (BTI) #2.  I love their exposure to emerging markets, and since my last DD they have announced a 20% stake in a Canadian cannabis company (OrganiGram). I upped my position significantly in the last couple of days.

Phillip Morris International (PM) #3 just a tad under BTI. Again, I love their exposure to emerging markets and brand portfolio. These guys sell Marlboro around the world.  Not my #1 position because they trade pretty high at the moment, but still up there for me.

Japan Tobacco International (JAPAY) #4.  Significantly lower stake than the first 3.  I'm still kind of a noob so I do rely on third-party analysis of companies to some extent, and I haven't been able to find much for them.  What I gather is that they had a poor performance last year, and also projected poor performance for 2021.  That said, they have a huge portion of the market share in Asia, where smoking rates are going up significantly.  Worth a small stake IMO.

Imperial Brands (IMBBY) #5. Similar stake to JAPAY.  These guys are the smallest of the bunch and a bit of a laggard.  They've been trading south for a long time and their last year was lackluster.   Innovation is also questionable.  That said, they are a huge international tobacco company, and I reckon they'll be here to stay and paying dividends for quite some time.  Worth a small stake.

**Other positions**

Universal Corp. (UVV) - Stake that's in between my top 3 and my lower 2 cigarette companies.  Largest grower of leaf tobacco in the world, and they sell to all 5 of the companies above.  Great dividend payout.  Trades fairly.  Didn't want to YOLO into them because there's little room for innovation here at the moment, but it's a solid business for the time being.

Turning Point Brands (TPB) - Similar position, and new since my last DD.  They sell Zig-Zag rolling papers in the US, smokeless tobacco, and also CBD products.  Steady revenue from what they already sell, and huge upside potential on cannabis legalization.  They have data that shows that all of their smoking papers sell markedly higher in legalized states, plus the potential for CBD and

Swedish Match (SWMAY) - Similar position, and new since my last DD.  They sell Zin, a nicotine pouch (tobacco-free) product that is dominating the US and Scandinavian markets at the moment.  Product shipments have increased markedly over the last 4-5 years with no signs of slowing down.  Oh, they sell those White Owl blunt wraps too, as well as Red Man Chew.  So steady revenue there, as chewing tobacco declines but White Owl sales rise.  Did not want to YOLO into it because I'm not sure about the future of nicotine pouches, but worth a small stake for the time being.

&#x200B;

**The Bottom Line**

I don't like the uncertainty of the market right now, and I feel I was a bit late to the game on many of the growth stocks.  I don't own purely tobacco, I also own the tech stocks I mentioned above plus some others in other sectors (feel free to ask).  But my largest position is by far in tobacco.  Like I said,  I think these are a safe bet medium-to-long term no matter what happens, with great dividends and huge potential growth opportunities in cannabis and other smoking alternatives.

Safer than throwing it all in an S+P 500 index fund, even if I won't get the same returns in the event that stonks always go up.  Lose some of the potential upside, but also lose a lot of the potential downside.  Fits my needs perfectly.

Moral questions: I'm a noob, small-time retail investor.  I don't think I'm killing anybody by investing small amounts of money in these companies.  And I don't feel bad making small amounts of money off of them.  I used to smoke and I like these stocks because that stuff is really addictive.  7 years off of it thankfully.

My dividends, for now, are all set to reinvest.

I am not a financial advisor, do your own DD."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Jokes on you, I quit smoking three days ago! No more dividends from me."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Big Tobacco is the best weed play, they will definitely get involved. They have all the distribution in place."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Great DD. I think the play for Big Tobacco isn't necessarily tobacco but cannabis. Both Altria and BTI are getting heavily in invested in the cannabis market with weed growers, weed tech companies, vaping tech, and the like. Big Tobacco already has the distribution networks, lobbying capability, capacity to grow, and access to banking that many of the pure weed companies lack. Couple that with the fact that tobacco companies have been planning for decades how they'd roll out legal cannabis products. This is the opportunity of a lifetime for them to pivot away from evil tobacco and onto ""healthy, cool, dank"" weed. 

&nbsp;

TLDR: I'm hella bullish on MO and BTI and am preparing my rocket to tendie town for when Congress passes national legalization. I will see you there.

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice, I just like the stocks."
03/18/2021,stocks,This is the first year in decades that smoking rates stayed almost the same in the US.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Thanks for this!

For me Swedish Match looks risky - let's of debt and negative Equity (I may not use the correct term as I'm not a cat nor accountant). Did you think into that?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I agree and purchased a substantial amount of MO last year at around $39. I see a lot more growth potential with weed and other alternative products. It seemed like a great value play with big growth potential if they are able to capitalize on cannabis and transition/expand from combustible tobacco. 

Plus I’m getting about a 9% dividend yield. Cheers!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Except smoking is dead.  I think the road ahead is rocky for big tobacco.  They aren't going anywhere but I don't see them thriving either.

03/18/2021,stocks,"Honestly, not bad plays. Also, smoking might be declining but there are also modern alternative products that are popular right now. Especially, snus tobacco-free alternatives like Velo and Zyn."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Hey I quit 7 years ago!  Congratulations to you, it was one of the best decisions of my life!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I agree. I wouldn't say it's 100%, they could definitely fumble it, but I do like the odds.  Especially with more than one company getting involved.  MO and BTI are strongly involved, actually I think IMMBY is also taking a look at it too.

But the other cool thing is even if they fumble it's not like they're going to collapse immediately.  Still a strong business without weed.  I'm not in on pot stocks because there's still a lot of uncertainty there and it's still not totally clear who's going to be the big winner.

I heard someone say it's like Netscape in the world of internet browsers.  Just because it's first doesn't mean it's the best."
03/18/2021,stocks,"$MO owns 43% of CRONOS (a weed stock).  That holding accounts for only around 1/5000 of $MO total value.  I would expect MO to continue taking a larger position in weed stocks to offset the declines in the US tobacco market.  As you mentioned, the dividend here is great."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm not totally sure about the cannabis play.  There's a lot of uncertainty there, and while these companies are well-positioned to bring these products to market, there's no guarantee that they'll be able to deliver. You also have to wonder if pot smokers will be comfortable buying weed products from a cigarette company.  Some pot smokers are pretty anti-tobacco.

I'm not saying it's a bad play, and their stake in cannabis definitely made me more bullish.  But if the cigarette business weren't there I wouldn't be in on these stocks.  I like to think that they have a very nice cushion from tobacco with a strong potential for growth in cannabis.

You win steady, with a small chance of winning big.  What's not to love?"
03/18/2021,stocks,Great data.  I wasn't aware of that but I did see that smoking rates have not been declining as sharply as they once were.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Take a look at their Q4 presentation. They're using their debt to finance their Zin business which is absolutely booming.  And IIRC the debt to EBITDA is less than 3 and decreasing. 

It's actually one of the businesses here with the strongest outlook for growth, strictly looking at their numbers.  That's why I'm in it.  It's a small portion of my portfolio, however, because I'm not sure about the long-term future for nicotine pouches.  It's something I'll be watching closely as we go along and be ready to sell when needed.

And sure thing!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Oh, that's a very interesting one that I hadn't heard of.  Any thoughts?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Good for you!  Yes, in just one month MO has been my top performer and I'm looking forward to those sweet dividends."
03/18/2021,stocks,"> Except smoking is dead. I think the road ahead is rocky for big tobacco. They aren't going anywhere but I don't see them thriving either.

That's not true.  It will only decline slightly in the first world and in the developing world it's actually rising pretty significantly.  Speaking at least 30 years out here.

> Edit: I have been in the vapor space for 6 years now. People who have given up cigarettes do not want to vape something made by big tobacco.

Fair enough.  I don't love the vapor play of Big Tobacco, honestly.  Maybe more promise in the heat-not-burn segment."
03/18/2021,stocks,Yeah I agree tobacco is dead.  You’ll get your 7-8% divy but the stock isn’t going to 5-10x in 10 years.  Stock is going to be in the same range as it’s been for the last 10 years.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yep, I'm specifically in Swedish Match because they lead that sector with Zin. I think the other companies have similar products as well."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Thank you. I plan to use daily cigarette money for stocks going forward, so it feels like an extra reward seeing things grow."
03/18/2021,stocks,"They're about to be approved for the first reduced risk cigarette on the market.  They essentially figured out you can CRSPR the tobacco plant to engineer nicotine OUT of the plant.  No nicotine, no addiction.

03/18/2021,stocks,"Some thoughts on this:

Even if the FDA regulates this, that's only in one market. And if they do, Altria and British American will most certainly sell similar products, even if they have to license them from XXII.  Finally, I like the nicotine aspect... it's good for business. I'm not sure how much market share a nicotine free cigarette can take... there'd have to be regulation in place and I'm not sure about the odds on that. 

I see the possible growth on this stock when taking the cannabis business into account as well.  But it's not for me. Seems like a risky play with potentially high rewards.  I will pass for now.

Best of luck to you and thanks for the info!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"For those of us long on XXII the “about to happen” logic is now about 5-6 years in the making.

03/18/2021,stocks,"Ironically, Altria is being sued over patent infringement on Juul vaping tech. My take is that Big T got caught with their pants down in regards to vaping and its popularity.

Juul and other e-cigs/vape pens were a big hit but now they are being stymied by the stigma of smoking and tobacco.

Also keep in mind that if anyone knows how to deal with lawsuits, it's Altria. This doesn't change my opinion on them.

I agree that their vaping products are not the most attractive.  I'm in it mostly for the cigarette business.  Heat-not-burn looks good from their position in terms of alternate products."

I'm an adult in late 20s with disposable income and could not justify paying $180-300 for a high end HEADSET like the competitors offer.) 

- Recently, they've made the jump into the complementary accessories like you've mentioned. Sign that they are looking to grow.(Also a reason to dislike, will they be successful?)

- Has been one of the better performing stocks In my portfolio.


Why I dont like the stock:

- will the acquisitions provide value in short or long term? 

- it's hard to imagine HEAR being able to top a year like the stay-at-home, pandemic-driven 2020.

- the gaming accessory space is becoming very competitive.

TM is a debt heavy company which is not unusual for automotive manufacturers. But, it is a great growth stock that’s volatility is especially low. The real reason I say TM as a buy is because they are going to be an adversary to Tesla by making cheap, reliable, and driver-friendly EV’s. 

The market this year has pumped electronic vehicle start ups 300-1500%. People are looking for the next Tesla, and for the for seeable future I don’t think there is going to be one. But that doesn’t mean we can forget the most popular Automotive manufacturer in the world. Toyota has been fiddling around with electric cars for decades now. And they have many models set to release next year that are full electronic vehicles. Not to mention for those customers who are not ready to make the switch to electronic vehicles, Toyota makes some of the most gasoline efficient sedans and hybrids. Hybrids our poised for major tax benefits under the Biden administration.

He would prefer going down the hydrogen fuel cell route. It will be harder than people think to change from ICE to EV as profit disappears from the service side and shifts elsewhere. 

Toyota is working on solid state batteries but so are many others. If the tech was solved this year, they may be able to scale it up meaningfully towards the end of this decade. I don't expect to see it in scale until next decade. If they wait for new tech before investing in battery production at scale, they'll be left behind this decade.

I would take VW over TM as #2 to Tesla. They are going down the right path based on their recent power day presentation imo. They are following a similar path to Tesla but much slower. They're bringing battery production in-house but will still only be at less than 1/10th of Tesla capacity in 2030. It really illustrates the difficult balancing act of winding down their cash cow ICE business while transition into an EV business that will be unprofitable for some time.

I don't really know any others aside from TD Ameritrade (and they're making the account-making process really difficult for some reason). All I really want out of it is to be able to invest basically as soon as I put money into it, because I really want to have minimum time between selling my stocks on the old broker and re buying them on the new one (and preferably not having to pay fees to do so).

2021-03-18 01:27:06,stocks,"Isn’t exponential consistent growth, with no exception of index funds, unsustainable? Perhaps a hot take, but I’m having a difficult time seeing a consistent rate of return with index funds on a raw number scale.

The logical conclusion of index funds always being successful is dealing with exponential growth that is ‘expected by investors’ to reach and break through the quadrillions. 

Unless I’m missing something, is there not a point in which there is simply not enough money to support the new 7% expectation?
  
For instance right now $2.2 trillion would have to be invested into all of the S&P500 to meet the ‘average 7% quota’. But in 50 years, if the market cap were $1.04 quadrillion as expected, it would take $65 trillion to maintain the same effect.

Assuming inflation in the US is stable around where it is now, consumers and perhaps even companies wouldn’t be able to invest enough to build the 7% return that they initially invested for, given that the requirement for it is exponentially growing.

The only caveat that i can think of at the moment that allows this 7% expectation to continue is an equal % of inflation, yet that would ruin the point of traditional investing if %inflation=%rate of return

(Market cap calculations used for 50 years out is multiplying by 29.45, which is 1.07^50)"

03/18/2021,stocks,"If you buy a painting from an unknown artist for $100 and the artist goes on to become world famous and then meets an untimely demise, your painting may then be appraised for $10,000. Where did all the money come from? That 100x increase is way more than inflation since the time you bought the painting. The thing is there is no money, at least not yet. There is only the painting until you sell it. The value of your asset increased, but that doesn't mean that it somehow sucked money out of the economy equivalent to that increase in value. It simply became worth more because people were willing to pay more for it. The same is true for stocks. If people are willing to pay more for them they go up in value. That increase in value does not require an equivalent amount of money to be destroyed."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Companies are full of smart, hard working people who actually create value.  Central banks ""lend"" pretend money to banks, who lend it as real money, helping people create that value.  It's really great."

I think you're misunderstanding how the market works. I can put in a limit order for $136 on aapl, and the companies total worth will jump 10% (or a 100 billion dollars in market cap). There doesn't have to be 100 billion in new investments for it to grow by that amount. 

The OC was on the money until he detoured into crazy town with all the pyramid scheme nonsense. 

A company can not grow and still earn 7% for investors. All we're doing is paying for the rights to future cash flows. A company that doesn't grow can trade at a PE of 15 and generate 7% in returns via buybacks and dividends or stock appreciation due to growing the balance sheet.

There's a hurdle rate that is set by the market. If it's too low, then people won't invest - this was generally the mechanics of the dot com bust, people saw 6% treasuries and started wondering why it was worth considering the stock market at a PE of 50.

7% is probably lofty from the current valuations though. It'll likely be in the 5-6% range going forward."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Ah, but yes, you are right in the sense that it is exponential growth, but if you go towards infinity it is a logistic curve.

03/18/2021,stocks,Please reread my comment. I clarified it since people like you misinterpreted the paragraph about pyramid schemes. Of course there's an incentive to buy low. It is besides the point.
03/18/2021,stocks,How so?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Well in the case of the painting, I would just have paper gains, at least until I actually sell it. 

But the gains in the stock market aren’t just paper gains, the gains have been realized by each generation. 

Lots of people use the stock market to save for retirement. Since it has consistently gone up over the long-term, anyone making contributions over the course of their career has probably ended up positive by the time of retirement, even if they had to go through some bear markets. 

So basically, people from each generation are getting more money out of the market than they put in. It just doesn’t really add up to me, it really does seem like money is being created from nothing."
03/18/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/18/2021,stocks,"Why is it not essentially a pyramid scheme? On the stock market, current investors have an incentive to ""recruit"" new investors to pump up demand. The new investors then have an incentive to ""recruit"" new ones. And so on.

Of course there are differences too, but my point is that there's a ""recruitment feedback loop"" inherent to both that pumps up value to those sitting at the top of the chain (those that invested first).

(I agree with all your other comments.)"
03/18/2021,stocks,"It's not money that's being created; it's value. It's also not created from nothing, but rather from the initial capital investments from IPOs, secondary offerings, and any other situation where a company issues shares to pay for something and then from the continued operations of the company.

Value can be created or destroyed rather easily. If you make a nice meal from raw ingredients, you'll generally be able to sell it for more than the ingredients. On the other hand, if you burn everything and end up with something inedible you've destroy the value of the raw ingredients. Companies exist to create value in one way or another, then sell that value for money, and eventually return money to the shareholders.

So yeah, something is being created and we do use money to exchange for what's being created. Since companies on the whole are more productive than destructive in terms of goods and services that are exchanged for money and even tend to increase their productivity over time, then each generation should be able to take more out than they put in. The investment that they either put directly into the company or bought the right to has been working for all those years, not as actual cash, but as plants or labor or raw materials with the proceeds continually reinvested or distributed back to the shareholders."

2021-03-18 01:21:50,stocks,"$BB 3/17/2021 - Green on St Patties Day Hey guys!  


It was a solid day today, even with the uncertainty today due to waiting on the fed's decision whether or not to increase the interest rates. Even before their decision, $BB is still holding very well. \~1% in the red for most of the day, and once they released no interest rate hikes we spiked \~4% from today's low. That's awesome.  


ICYMI - Feds are saying there are no interest rate hikes likely through 2023  
SOURCE: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/fed-decision-march-2021-fed-sees-stronger-economy-higher-inflation-but-no-rate-hikes.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/fed-decision-march-2021-fed-sees-stronger-economy-higher-inflation-but-no-rate-hikes.html)  


What does this mean, you ask?   
Interest rates are also known as the ""price of money"". Low interest means borrowing money is cheap, and if borrowing money is cheap you can take out a loan and make more money with that loan, negating the cost of interest you need to pay per month to the bank.  


For the dumb-dumbs: Money easy to borrow. Borrow money from bank and put money into stock market. Borrowed money easy to repay if stock market go up.   


For ultra-dumb dumb: Replace the word ""money"" in the sentence above with ""banana"". Borrowed money make banana into bigger banana.  


What else happened with $BB what the fuck else do you have to say?  
Low volume. Extremely low volume. From [tradingview.com](https://tradingview.com), this was the lowest trading day since January 13th. Lowest trading volume in over two months. Why is this relevant?  


We are green on very low volume. Green on low volume means people are accumulating slowly and holding. No/hardly any sellers. I can only assume that this is due to a lot of baggies and that there's a lot of people interested in having this stock hit that sweet $15 strike price this Friday. I'm currently expecting a lot of volatility in the next couple of days due to:  
\-No interest rate hikes  
\-$BB still holding that strong uptrend  
\-Very tight Bollinger Bands on the daily and hourly  
\-RSI on Daily, 4-hour, Hourly are smack dead in the center. This means we are not overbought so we have room to go up, that being said this also means we can go down.  
\-Triple Witching. Read this if you don't know what this is.   [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplewitchinghour.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplewitchinghour.asp)  


With tight Bollinger Bands, the RSI in the middle the stock is able to go either direction in the next couple of days, and triple witching hour happening this Friday, this means $BB COULD, by technical analysis methods, be very violent. Up or down.  


Right now, for those of you that are long and strong like me, do not worry about tomorrow or Friday if $BB goes down. Daily fluctuations do not matter in the long term.  
If $BB spikes, we might see some crazy numbers if it breaks the line at \~14.44.  


Enjoy the rest of your day and I'll catch you guys on my recap of the week on March 19th.  


Take care."

2021-03-18 01:11:38,stocks,Cash Account Better Than Margin? Hello I'm new to investing and opened a WeBull account however I heard that a cash account is better than a margin account. Without knowing this I created my account as margin. WeBull is not letting people switch right now currently and I'm not sure why. They said it would take up to two weeks for my account to be able to be switched. Should I deposit money now and start investing or wait till I can switch my account? I don't want to lose being able to get the stocks you get when you deposit money and I'm not sure how long it can be before I can't get them. Any advice would be great!
03/18/2021,stocks,"Advice i give to everyone that is new is, cash account is the best solution for first timers. Build your self up from there, remember you can always change to margin account"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I also use Webull... Like others mentioned, you can simply not use margin buying power, keep an eye on your ""settled funds"". The one reason a cash account is specifically better is that it is not subject to pdt rules, even if your account is less than 25k- as long as you spend only settled cash and wait t+2 to use the profits from a trade"
03/18/2021,stocks,"btw, can someone explain why there is a need to use margin? 

From what i see, with cash account, if I want high risk/reward ratio, I can go for options; it's already freaking high-risk."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Agree. From a discipline standpoint, not having access to margin account to avoid the temptation or a knee jerk buy is important as well."

If you use Webull, they give you access to your deposits immediately (before they are transferred from your bank). Sorry if that's no help, I'm not sure how you get settled early lol. Also if you try to buy using unsettled funds or sell stock purchased with unsettled funds you will be shown a warning, describing the t-2 rules before you execute"
2021-03-18 00:51:31,stocks,"Basic DD on Nano Dimensions and why it has major long term potential Hello everyone, 

I’m a 24 year old student who started investing a few months ago and would like to talk a bit about Nano Dimensions. 
The sources for the information below has been taken from Yahoo Finance, Interviews with the CEO, Videos that the company has made, other DD’s that had info I found to be usefull. Hope y’all like it. 

**What does Nano Dimensions do?**

First off. They sell 3D printers that can print all kinds of complex electric components like circuit boards, capacitators, antennes, sensors and SEMI CONDUCTURS.  Which Biden signed the executive order for because of the shortage of those at the end of last month. The CEO has a good track record. This ain’t his first Rodeo. Been involved in Aerospace, Security etc. Eli David is on the Board of Directors.


**Now why would anyone buy those printers?
Well a bunch of reasons.**

1. No outsourcing of production which saves them money. 

2. Increases confidentiality cause customers build their own IP. (E.g: Important for Defense/Medical)

3. Time saving since customers are able to get their prototypes within hours instead of days-weeks. 

4. Eco Friendly cause less waste compared to current manufacturing process

5. Automated printer = less operator maintenace

6. Able to be used 24/7

7. Their machines are just so much more efficient. E.g; The more layers a circuit board has, the more complex the manufacturing is right? Not for these printers. Nano Dimension's printers can print up to 30 layers at the same cost and ease as one with 2 layers. 

8. Will become able to be used in space. Whole lot cheaper to have some electronic component manufactured right there instead of having to send something into space. *CEO said that they will test the materials in Space and plan to manufacture Products for the use in Space. But for now they don't play to produce in space, that would contradict their plans for the automatic factory.*


**Financials:**

They did a bunch of offerings. Any shareholder might know that it’s been a bumpy ride. But it’s been worth it. 
Currently they’re sitting at little below $1.5 Billion cash and zero debt.
Market cap: $2.81B

**Revenue:**

2019 4thQ: $1.977.000

2020 3rdQ: $438.000

2020 4th Q: $1.971.000


This is a $6k YoY decrease from their 2019 4thQ Revenue. 
Now why isn’t this really that bad of a signal? Most of their revenue comes from selling these printers. These go for hundreds of thousands. Due to covid a lot of entities decided to hold off on capital expenses causing a major dip in revenue. But even tho covid is for the most part still around; we have seen a major spike compared to the previous quarter as capital expenses have started to open up for some of them. They were expected to have a lot less revenue and managed to hold pretty strong under the current circumstances.

**What about competition?**
Well tbh. Atm there ain’t no competition. Literally no one. These guys secured the patents. If this pops off they taking it all. 

**So where's the money coming from?**
They sell to Defense, Research Institutions, Automotive, Medical, fucking everywhere. I mean its electrical products they're making. What industry doesn’t use them? 

**Revenue streams:**

**1. Printer Sales**
As I said, these machines go for hundreds of thousands.  70% of customers renews their machine every time a new one comes out. They like the tech. So big chance that any new customer will buy more than 1 printer. Which ofc. also means years of recurring revenue and maintenance contracts.

**2. Recurring Revenue**
The blades and material need to be replaced.

**3. Nanoservices**
This is an interesting one. Last year they barely sold machines since companies atm lack the budget for these printers. However revenue was better than expected since customers who are currently lacking the budget come and pay for Nano Dimensions to print their project for them. Can be anywhere from $5-20k per project. 
The thing thats good here is, its a great opportunity for them to build a relationship with their customers and make them more familiar with the tech. CEO expects many of these customers to start buying the machines when their budgets open up post covid, causing a sling shot effect in sales. 

**4. Maintenance contracts**
Speaks for itself

So where is their potential growth? 

1.	They will release a new printer this year. *New Printer-Generation will be announced early summer, shipping will be possible eoy*
2.	They are still looking for more new types of electrical components to manufacture. *They are looking into nano-mechanical devices as well*
3. They are looking for acquisitions in 2 types of companies. I'll explain more on that below
4.	They are planning on making printers that will be able to be used for production instead of prototyping/testing. Some defense companies already use this as production because the projects they require aren’t possible to manufacture without these printers.
Now I don’t think I gotta explain why that’s a good thing.
Once their machines are able to be used for production that will open a completely new door to them  I believe 2022 is what the CEO said IIRC. 

**Acquisitions**

Now this $1.5B is gonna come in handy. It will be shares and cash for these acquisitions tho.  However the CEO refuses to enter the “rat race” where private companies have become overvalued and is taking his time to decide, refusing to overpay. Says he is in talks with multiple companies atm. 

Now the 2 types of companies they are looking to acquire are:

**Type A**: Companies that can help them with distribution and are working in the pcb industry. Market cap of $50-200M. 

**Type B**: Companies that have tech that they want to own and/or think is going to be big in 2-3 years.

Note: *One of the european ones will be a producer of machines, prop. central or eastern europe, to help them reducing their time to market for Dragonfly NG*

**Risks**

There is always a chance of them doing more offerings, although I don’t see that happening personally. *CEO made clear that they did not plan it in the near future.*
This is right now a niche market but with years will become huge imo. If you want something to daytrade this stock might not be it for you. It can be very volatile so if that’s not your thing stay away too. Also if they don’t spend this $1.5B wisely, investors may lose trust after having shares diluted a bunch of times. Personally I trust the CEO because of his track record with acquiring companies and taking his time, refusing to overpay for companies. 


That’s all I’ve got. 
Would like to hear some feedback. Anyone else invest in Nano Dimensions? What’s ya’ll opinions on the company and the future share price? Good investment or waste of time?


**TLDR; GOOD STOCK. BUY WHEN RED. CHECK BACK IN 5 YEARS.**

Edit: added some points made by u/KhanUlrik. See Italic text"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Bought in at the recent dip at 6.97. 
Pretty comfortable with it so far"
03/18/2021,stocks,"My top portfolio position, whenever it dipped below 8$ I bought like 80 more shares and I’m thinking about trimming other positions in my portfolio and expanding this one even further. In 5-10 years this has huge potential. I think how much they can grow in that amount will depend on their acquisitions though but with the technology as ahead of other companies as it is, this feels like a safe bet to me"
03/18/2021,stocks,Don’t they make offerings like every 30 days or something?
03/18/2021,stocks,The biggest red flag for me is its history of massive share dilution. I get that companies need to raise money but this one is something else.

03/18/2021,stocks,Well as someone else here mentioned..The CEO has made it clear there will be no more offerings in the near future. He'd be crazy to still go ahead and do it in the next few months
03/18/2021,stocks,He couldn't say the real name because the mods won't allow posts about the company because it has a low market cap.

03/18/2021,stocks,Personally I find both the regular TD Ameritrade page and app less user friendly than Fidelity’s. I’m hoping the conversion to Schwab will be soon. Would recommend Fidelity.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I use fidelity and like it. They have a tremendous amount of research tools available as well as stock screeners and a lot of clear information behind their research metrics. They also provide analysis from most leading analyst firms including Zacks. and contrary to the complaints about their UI, it isn't THAT bad. Clearly dated. clearly boomer orientated. very much boat-shoes and kakhis vibe... but eh, I don't care. I only every use desktop app and active trader pro though."
03/18/2021,stocks,"This is the only thing stopping me from switching to Fidelity. Fuck man, they need a complete overhaul of their UI; shit is so convoluted and ugly."

2021-03-18 00:50:37,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, March 17, 2021 Stocks edged higher, rallying sharply in the last few hours of the session as market participants digested the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) key monetary policy meeting and an upgraded economic outlook by the Federal Reserve. Treasury yields rose again, with the 10-year benchmark at 1.646% at the time of writing.

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package.  FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to speak tomorrow.

The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors, wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance, “The Fed certainly gave the market some meat to chew on, raising its economic growth forecast for 2021 significantly to 6.5%. The implication of this projection is that, at some point in 2022, U.S. GDP will exceed its pre-pandemic path. Despite this very strong outlook, the Fed played down the risk from inflation, with their projections showing a very modest and, importantly, only temporary overshoot of their 2% target – certainly a more subdued inflation outlook than many investors were fearing.”

Concerns continue to flare regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Germany, France, Italy, and Spain becoming the latest countries to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union’s vaccination efforts, which were already behind schedule. Studies are currently being conducted in the UK and other places. More information is needed.

2021-03-18 00:42:46,stocks,"Wash Sale and Lowering Cost Basis Newer investor here, and I'm trying to get a better understanding of wash sales. I've been purchasing shares of a particular volatile stock in increments at varying prices. My cost basis for 34 shares was $220/share and I sold one of the earlier shares that I paid the most for ($295) for $220, then bought one share back at $217.

This triggered a wash sale but brought my average cost basis down to $217/share (from $220/share). If the cost basis was brought down enough so that it is now lower than what the stock is currently worth, will the wash sale have any adverse effect on this (since I technically bought one share for $295, sold that share for $220, then bought another for $217)? Thanks!"
03/18/2021,stocks,The wash sale rule is for tax purposes. They won’t let you take an L on purpose for tax write offs. The money you lost in the first transaction of a stock is simply added back to your cost basis.
03/18/2021,stocks,Great breakdown with all that.
2021-03-18 00:39:09,stocks,Taxes on short term capital gains question I made like 80k from my job and profitted 65k on the market all short term. I'm a single and one filer and live in california. First time doing my taxes with stocks and its saying I owe 18k is that right? I lost a lot of that profit at the start of this year. So I can't claim against it as a loss? Or is there like a break even?
03/18/2021,stocks,"80k regular income plus 65k in gains, so 145k total.  The 18k on the gains is 27-28%.  

If it were my money, I'd examine things closely.   But it's not, so all I'll do is point to Investopedia, who says *""As regular taxable income, short-term gains are subject to whichever tax bracket you fall under. There are currently seven federal tax brackets in the U.S., with rates ranging from 10% to 37%.""*  

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp)

It's entirely believable.  If you want to reduce it, get an accountant.  Involving one sooner may have had a greater effect (his advice may have been more helpful during the actual tax year), but it's never too late to start."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You needed to pay quarterly tax payments last year.  So expect a penalty and interest payment letter after you file your taxes, from both the IRS and your State.  Leave aside a couple of grand if you have to pay an extra 18k in taxes.  

Mark your calendar for this year.  1st payment due = April 15th.  2nd payment = June 15th.  3rd payment = Sept 15th.  4th payment = Jan 15th, 2022

If you are making gains this year and expect to make similar, you should be paying $4500 on those dates."
03/18/2021,stocks,"So a que about the percentage here, isn’t 18k of 65k like 27 something percent, how did you know it is 22. I’m always confused about capital gains."
03/18/2021,stocks,There are tax tables you can look up with a simple Google search. Just apply your situation to the table and that's how you find what % your gains will be taxed.

2021-03-18 00:24:02,stocks,"I have a question: opening a long position of less than $4,000 of marginable securities, what's the value of Excess Equity?  

Assuming that I have a new margin account, I deposit $2,000, after that I buy marginable securities worth $3,000. My Equity will be:

**Equity = Long Market Value (LMV) – Debit Balance (DB)**  
$2,000 = $3,000 - $1,000

But what my Excess Equity is going to be?

**Excess Equity = Equity − Required Regulation T Equity**

1. $0 = $2,000 - $2,000  
or
2. $500 = $2,000 - $1,500

What's my ""Required Regulation T Equity"" in the formula? I know that initial margin percentage must be the greater of $2,000 or 50% and that's why I have to deposit $2,000 instead of the 50% of LMV ($1,500), but in the excess equity formula which value should I consider, the 50% of the LMV or $2,000?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I wouldn't really think about it like this.  Simplifying the actual, complex world of margin requirements is not a good idea.

When in doubt, you need to call your broker and talk to them.

Margin requirements will vary by broker and by security.  In addition, the requirements can change at any given time without notice.  In addition, if you have an account with multiple positions, it becomes even more difficult for a human to compute what is happening without software calculations.  In addition, if you have derivates ... etc.

When in doubt, you have to call them.  And you have to get used to calling and talking to them because if, in the horrible circumstance, where you have a margin problem, you need to know who to call so you can fix it before they nuke your account."
03/18/2021,stocks,"In reality is the ""Minimum Margin"" that I don't understand very well:

[https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsmarginhtm.html](https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsmarginhtm.html)  
""Before You Trade – Minimum Margin

Before trading on margin, FINRA, for example, requires you to deposit with your brokerage firm a minimum of $2,000 or 100 percent of the purchase price, whichever is less. This is known as the ""minimum margin."" Some firms may require you to deposit more than $2,000.""

I know about the Initial Margin Requirement and about the Initial Minimum Equity Requiremente, but... does this ""Minimum Margin"" apply to EVERY purchase on margin when securities are worth less than $4,000? For example, assuming I do have more than $2,000 of Equity does that mean that if I buy marginable securities worth $200 the initial margin requirement is 100% ($200) only because the the purchase value is less than $2,000? Or is it a rule only for the initial deposit?"
03/18/2021,stocks,Pretty sure it depends on the ticker and what your broker decides is the margin value on that stock.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I interpret it as:

<$2000 account value is treated as a cash account and you need to fully purchase everything.

\>=$2000 account value you can begin trading on margin.

In general, if you are just buying things, like buying stocks, if you have the cash for the initial purchase, you are good to go.

In addition, your broker should have an Equity Percentage display somewhere.  If it reads 100%, you are not on margin."
03/18/2021,stocks,"How do you interpret this: https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=26658 it says: ""25% 1 * Stock Value (minimum of $2,000 or 100% of the purchase price, whichever is less)"" 

Reading this it seems that (assuming you have enough equity) EVERY new long position is going to always have a Initial Margin Requirement of 100% if the purchase value is less than $2,000. It seems like if you open 20 long position (consecutively) each one worth $400 your are going to have an initial margin of 100% ($8,000) but if you open all the positions together with a purchase price of $8,000 your initial margin is going to be 25% ($2,000), but that's illogic."
2021-03-18 00:18:15,stocks,"What to hold in the next months? FED has just given the stockmarket a 20% rise over the next year, just by keeping the interest rate low and buying corporate debt.

What do you think?"
03/18/2021,stocks,I completely bought the 2021 bull market today. I just could feel the pop coming after the fed announcement. I don't see anything killing the run over the next few months.

However, they already have some partnerships as BMW already support Apple CarKey and CarPlay.

2021-03-17 23:49:32,stocks,"Hypothetical Situation: where to place 100K in a stock market crash Hello All,

I wanted to get your opinion of what you would buy during a stock market crash. Nearing the one year anniversary of the 2020 Crash, I think this would be interesting. 

**What would you choose:**

1. Low cost S&P index fund
2. Individual stocks: if so which ones and why?
3. Gold/Silver/Oil ect.
4. Tech sector stocks
5. International stocks
6. Dividend paying funds/stocks
7. Other: (*please explain more)*"

So I guess it depends on what causes the crash. If a certain sector wasn't hit in particular I'd go with the overall index funds and call it good. Never know who doesn't survive a crash. Companies with lots of cash would be the safest."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You all should consider GME as a possible reason for a stock crash. A massive short-squeeze could cause widespread deleveraging that could cause a panic and crash the market. I have GME stock as a hedge against this possibility. I also would invest in SQQQ, like some others have said"
03/18/2021,stocks,"If I had to do it again, I would have shorted just the XLE and the KBE and raised cash until there was a bottom... I had some puts on the SPY and was 50 percent cash by the time it got absolutely insane.

I would buy any mega cap tech if it significantly dropped suddenly like it did a year ago."

Many tech stocks tanked and rose above their original pre-crash numbers relatively quick.   Wait for my tech stocks to return to its original pre-crash price, then take that and invest in stocks that tanked haaaarrrrdd, like airlines, hotels, and cruise lines.

And like before, who's to say that institutional money isn't going to stop the squeeze like last time, if your point about a market crash is true? If GameStop squeezing to the proportions you claim it will squeeze to has the potential to crash the market, why aren't any institutions or even the government stopping it from happening on the first place?

03/18/2021,stocks,"I definitely respect your points here. And on all accounts, I would think the same if I hadn't started looking into this further. There's one too many correlations to suggest that the true short-percentage is much higher than whatever FINRA/FINTEL is saying these days. For one, synthetic shorts are not counted towards the float. Even today in the GME hearing naked shorting was discussed as a big problem. Additional, many have noticed ETFs that contain GME being shorted in high volumes: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m5v1xy/i_think_its_quite_evident_they_shorted_gme/)

Evidently, short-sellers are able to short the ETFs, and then immediately cover all non-GME shares, effectively shorting GME without the short-interest data showing up in reports such as FINRA. 

If you have been following GME closely, there was a large dip from 340 down to 180 recently. The dip correlated with a huge number of shares being taken off iBorrowDesk, as well as just about every single media outlet reporting within minutes that GME dropping out of the sky. Suspicious, but not concrete evidence, yes. 

If this isn't enough, there is also Citadel's long history of being fined for illegally misreporting short data. See link [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel_has_no_clothes/)

Recently, it was also realized the GME (since February) has had a negative beta value of -2.09 (or lower). If you are not familiar, this means that GME is negatively correlated with the overall stock market. If the stock market goes down 10%, GME goes up 20%. If the market goes up 10%, GME goes down 20%, which is just a prediction model. I'd encourage you to look it up if you're not familiar. Again, these seems correlated, but not fully concrete. There has been very consistent data showing these opposite reactions when the market does poorly and GME does well.

>and institutions aren't putting their money behind the stock after seeing it's insane volatility

**This statement is very incorrect, surprisingly**. GME is going up *predominately* because of institutional buying. Get this, Fintel is reporting 136% institutional ownership of GME shares. See link [here](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme). But how is that possible?

See, this is the killer out of all the things that might be considered speculative, but not concrete. You can't get 136% ownership without a whole lot of naked shorts (synthetic shares) out there. And institutions are not selling. Just check SEC 13D/G forms.

If the whole shebang was over, why would institutions not sell right now? GME is at an insane price, around 200 something right now.

This is the killer of all the theories that all the shorts are covered. At the very least, there's a whole lot of naked shorts out there, and a big problem with the share distribution and ownership of GME

So let's say it does squeeze like last time, and RH gets shut down. Or how about all the brokers? Well, RH claimed to have a liquidity issue, and frankly, they may have been right, but for all the wrong reasons of a poorly run brokerage. There's some outlandish theories out there that I won't entertain you with, but the fact of the matter is that the difference this time is that institutions are leading the charge into the short squeeze. Just look at the 13D/G forms and you'll see this is a hedge firm vs hedge firm + other institutions battle. They're going to have more influence and power than a bunch of idiots on the internet.

The main reason the government has not stepped in is probably due to both ignorance of the true nature of the situation, as well as the inability to fix the problem. The problem really has to deal with debts. A short is a debt, so if there is a bunch of shorts out there, closing down GME or something does not solve the debt issue. The brokerages are still on the hook to get their loans back.

Where I might agree is whether a short-squeeze could actually cause enough deleveraging to cause a sizeable dip, and then cause a market crash based on panic. Perhaps it would just result in a small dip to the overall market, I don't know."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I I knew what parabolically meant, I’d give it a shot 😂"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Parabolic is called parabolic for a reason. It means that if it were to continue, it would become infinite. Which is not possible in a world where money is finite. 

Something like this can not statistically stay parabolic.

It’s a fallacy that prior performance has anything to do with future performance. See: Bogle - Little book of common sense investing. Many mutual funds were hailed as “parabolic” or with 40% gains etc, just to run into a wall, lose 30-80% their value and plateau afterwards. 

Things can not continue to go up parabolically."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Well, yes. I agree with you. Also, money is not finite. Nor is human productivity to back it up. Money definitely not. In fact, you can plot the amount of money in the world against global stock market prices and you'd get a perfect correlation. And before you scream the bogeyman of inflation, it's deflation that the developed world has been grappling with for a long time now. Physical resources are, yes, but growth of late has been tied to maximizing our resources, whether human or physical, rather than creating more. That will continue, especially with an aging and shrinking population.

No one can predict the future. But the last two decades have been a time of exponential growth. Will that continue, or have we hit a wall? Particularly in tech? I think we're going to find innovations in AI and biotech especially that'll supercharge our longevity and productivity in different ways. So yes, I find a lot of reasons for growth in equity markets to continue in a big way.

Here is an article to chew on. And I think this number is conservative.

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/03/17/openais-altman-ai-will-make-wealth-to-pay-all-adults-13500-a-year.html

In this case, you want to be on the side of owning the equities of companies that make this all possible. The 13K will be a pittance in comparison, as will wages for many, absent public policy interventions.

So yeah, I can either bet on that reasoning and keep an open mind. Or listen to Bogle and be wary and wait for a crash that'll likely never appear, because the underlying secular trends are simply too promising.

But yeah, your username definitely checks out 😂"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Doesn’t that make it NOT a fallacy that past performance can predict future performance? Which is to say, the farther out you get on a “parabolic” curve, the greater likelihood there is of coming back down? (ARKK I’m looking at you here!)"

SQQQ is an inverse x3 so if nasdaq 100 goes down 3% you gain 9% and Vice versa. In a bear market SQQQ is great to have. In a bull you’d want to go with the TQQQ. So basically, TQQQ is just QQQ X3. It’s risky but I like to live on the edge. Why lose 10% when you can lose 30!!!!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"The basic concept of **leverage** involves borrowing capital to invest in more stock than what you can afford on your own. Leverage can result in an increase in your return on investment, but you can lose more money.

Basically they use options and derivatives to invest 3x for every dollar. Normally a stock moves up or down 1:1. For a leveraged stock like tqqq(triple leveraged) for every 1 dollar the nasdaq moves (up or down) its a $3 price movement.

That is to say its just higher risk/reward.  If you think the markets going to go up you can get 3x more than qqq, but if it goes down the value also goes down 3x."

Pay attention to the economic numbers; everything will be fine. I don’t understand why everyone is freaking out, but my guess would be, with more retail players, more volatility. Seeing red, sell. Seeing green, buy. When it should be the opposite. Could also be the boomer generation retiring and fearing so withdrawing from stocks. If you’re long-term, just hold tight and buy when you can."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Seriously, I bought more this morning because it was down but not necessarily because I thought the market would definitely pop after his comments. But it was pretty easy to guess exactly what he would say, which is why I'm still curious how it seemed to surprise so many people. As you say, he's been telegraphing his position the entire year and it's basically the only thing he can do that makes any sense as well."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Powell didn't even talk about the yield though and any potential plan if they got out of control, no one seemed to care though."
03/18/2021,stocks,Yep. I certainly bought quite a bit 9am-11am Pacific. It was quite nice. Buy when people panic is a good strat so far.

The difference goes into banks' pockets. When they've made back the money they were leaving on the table in 2020, the Fed will start to follow the rates up to keep the bank vig constant.

[Bond traders are also raising the government's borrowing costs and have been since August.](https://images.mktw.net/im-270807)

So the Fed is riding with its hands off the handlebars for now, waiting for market forces to cause their own trouble."

Ppl who jerk it to QQQ don’t realize it took 17 years to recover. The modern day investors patience is gone after about 5 days of trading."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I agree. That matched with the velocity of the M1 (and M2 savings increasing substantially until recently). 
But, as yields rise, prices in bonds drop (i.e., they’re inversely related endogenous). But we have a lot of wealth growth with some individuals, rate of return is constantly changing, risk, liquidity, inflation, etc. (i.e., exogenous). So I believe many firms are liquidating and hedging via bonds (betting that the Fed will raise sooner rather than later, maybe 22 vs 23). The bond markets are much bigger than most of us realize. By doing this, they’re betting that they can get these bonds at a decent price and sell them for a better/more attractive price later. This will be beneficial if the inflation rate increases more and longer than we think because whoever holds/bought the bonds (lenders), loses during inflationary times while the buyers (borrowers), gain during this time because they’re borrowed money is worth more than their actual money.
I could be wrong, but I feel this is a bet for most firms. And a safe one at that."

03/18/2021,stocks,"You think they are buying bonds now even though yields look to keep increasing for a bit, and then hoping yields fall later on?  Not sure that strategy has a lot of appeal.  I think they'd rather sit on cash or very short term bonds (or equivalents) and then buy after the yields rise higher.  Those bonds would be more worth holding and possibly being sold at a premium in future years.

Personally I think the 10-yr will be around 2% before the end of the year.  If there is a big correction then who knows where it will end up though."
03/18/2021,stocks,Is it though? Technology is naturally causing deflation. Why should asset owner reap all the gains of automation. Even Adam Smith foresaw technology supposing to benefit the lives of everyone. But as it stands we have made massive gains but central banks have worked to make sure only asset owners where able to reap those gains.

03/18/2021,stocks,Deflation means you'll have to lower prices the entire time you're in business even if you have a moat or a monopoly. It puts a big hole in future profit projections and in investment. It's what turns recession into depression.
03/18/2021,stocks,AAPL and AMZN are perma-meme stocks. As long as FAANG is a thing.
03/18/2021,stocks,"The total market (VTI used as a proxy) is up over 25% since Jan 1, 2020 with real 2020 GDP of -3.5% and an estimate between 5 and 7% for 2021. Typically the market trades a little better than GDP since theres always a bit of speculation involved, but a 20% decrease would actually be somewhat reasonable. Regardless, I don't think that banks, who Powell explicitly stated had the ability to survive a stress test, being forced to sell some treasury bonds to meet leverage requirements would be as catastrophic as you are claiming. 

The narrative was that the increase in the yields of 10Y treasuries caused the dip in equities, I don't think that is accurate to the actual reason the market had a correction after running a 10% increase in the first 2 months of the year. Market reporters feel the need to attribute something to a change in the market, this narrative was probably the most convenient. A word to the wise, don't blindly trust what you read from news outlets as being 100% factual every time. 

Stress tests are performed to ensure that banks are liquid enough to handle an economic downturn. In short, it's a test of a bank's LCR. Freeing up more money to loan by selling what is likely a small portion of bonds relative to the overall market will likely drive up yields across the broader bond market, but were talking maybe tens of base percentage points...(<0.1% to yields)."
03/18/2021,stocks,Canada recently set a date to taper off the bank covid exceptions.  I expect a taper off for America too.   That probably wants to wait to announce so he give a more nuanced discussion and control the narrative.

03/18/2021,stocks,"I don’t understand what you’re trying to say. There are multiple reasons why something increases in price. Inflation is one, and yeah I’m sure inflation has increased prices on many goods to some extent, but the housing materials sector is currently under strain due to supply shortages and greater-than-normal demand. Supply shortages include severe delays with international shipping, ongoing disputes over Canadian lumber, and overall slowdowns within the US. Inflation isn’t the major reason these prices have gone up.

I don’t know what you want me to say. Buy silver, gold, canned goods, and ammo?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I can't see a use case yet for 3D printing something in wood, as 3D printing is currently best used for small objects that would otherwise be very expensive to machine, but if there is an application out there, someone will find it and build it."

He's not going to do anything to slow a recovery. But he's looking straight at the 7% number though and realizing if he does anything to goose it, it could go haywire.

The unusual thing is he said they won't do anything on interest rates until EOY *2023.*  That's almost 3 years.

I don't know how he can be that confident. He's got data we don't see, somehow."

That's about 1% of total outstanding treasuries. If all US banks were forced to completely liquidate all treasury notes, there would be maybe 3% more notes in the market and there is no way  that they would completely liquidate them. Most likely is to sell off about 50% based on historical balances. Call me crazy, but a 1.5% increase in supply does not yield a 10% drop in price (ie. Higher yields). The US treasury sold more bonds within the last several weeks than the banks would have to liquidate to meet old benchmarks. Can you please quantify the change you expect in the bond market and use data to justify it? I feel as if I have to be missing something for us to have drastically different expectations."

2021-03-17 23:01:41,stocks,"What are your thoughts on SLGG? (Super League Gaming, Inc.) I have been eyeing the Super League Gaming, Inc. for a few weeks now and this is one of those companies that I been frequently researching and as amateur gamer myself I can see potential in this company. I am not by any means a pro or expert in the stock market and all my thoughts and reasoning can be gibberish towards those who know what they are talking about. I'm sorry If my discussion seems absurd, I am only about 1 year into stock trading. 

Super League Gaming, Inc. (SLGG) is a content and community platform that is meant to prioritize amateur gaming and create content, and host championships/tournaments. They are meant to bring amateur gamers into the world of esports.

Here are some facts about their fourth quarter and full 2020 year returns:

\- Fourth quarter revenues reach record $779,000 in 2020, up 197% compared to 2019

\- Fourth quarter gross profit margins increased 1300 basis points to 62%

\- Full year 2020 revenues of $2.1 million, up 90% from $1.1 million in 2019

\- Full year 2020 gross profit margins rose 600 basis points to 59%

In addition to these numbers, they have nearly tripled registered users from 1 million to 2.9 million in only a year (2019 to 2020) and total engagement hours more than tripled from 15 million hours to 72 million hours. 

Recently they also recently acquired Mobcrush which is a broadcasting platform that is well known for its streaming capabilities and services. The cool thing about Mobcrush is that you can use it to stream throughout multiple streaming services such as Twitch, Mixer, Youtube, and Twitter simultaneously. While I never used Mobcrush personally, it seems like a promising broadcasting platform to reach multiple audiences.   

This company clearly has had some large accomplishments within only a year. I expect to see these numbers to continue rising as the company becomes more known and involved with the gaming community. 

Here is a February 2021 investor presentation is any of you want to look more into their partnerships, goals, and to-date accomplishments - [https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\_7389cf3f88be8a4d45874654668ab134/superleague/db/640/5343/pdf/SLGG+Investor+Presentation+-+February+2021.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_7389cf3f88be8a4d45874654668ab134/superleague/db/640/5343/pdf/SLGG+Investor+Presentation+-+February+2021.pdf)

This is there investor relations webpage as well to check out latest news, media, and events from the company - [https://ir.superleague.com/](https://ir.superleague.com/)

There is more on the company regarding partnerships, their business model, and future outlook. I just wanted to show people this company as I never see it being discussed on reddit. Thank you if you read through my little discussion, it was my first of hopefully more to come! I will elaborate or engage with those who choose to do so."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I am long SLGG. I'm not certain if they will or won't be one of the successful ESports companies, but the purchase/merger with MobCrush is positive.

Some stats that were put out in their Annual Report that were promising, yet misleading: 

Both Twitch and YouTube gaming have more viewers than HBO Max, Netflix, and Spotify. However, it should be noted that HBOMax and Netflix are not free services dependent on ad revenue. So the comparison isn't really a fair one.

That being said, the viewers for Twitch and YouTube Gaming show that there are mass amounts of potential viewers. SLGG needs to find a way to monetize on that more effectively. Hopefully increasing their viewers with the MobCrush deal will help move them from the ""harvesting viewers"" phase into the earning phase."

The whole sector lost a lot of business because of the pandemic, which is why stocks dropped early 2020. With the vaccination process now on full blast hospitality stocks gradually got back and are currently trading close to pre-pandemic levels, some are at ATH, based on good expectations about the future. But the pandemic is not over and all the business these companies expect to get in the following year or so is already priced in very optimistically. Recovery will be a process that takes more than a year. Covid is not gone yet and we hear on the news about a British variant, Brazil variant, Nigerian variant, all in all there is a lot of uncertainty if existing vaccines are effective against different variants, so there are factors that might further slow down the recovery process of the hospitality industry. 

I wanna know what am I missing or why I'm wrong believing that most stocks in the sector are overvalued right now."
03/18/2021,stocks,Definitely overvalued and based on a lot of speculation. Business travel has been permanently changed now that companies know they can operate more remotely. I worked in the industry for many years and the people I still connect with say that a lot of the damage is irreversible. The only exception being hotels in hot spots for vacation which are booking up fast but still relatively cheap.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I think AirBnB broke the hotel model and there are a bunch of properties that these companies own that are heavily tied to business travel. They will weigh on margins well into 2023. But there are significant winners in the short term when you look at specifically leisure.

They have pricing power based on demand. The casinos are cash cows especially with all this money sloshing around. I think the 2018 price high is more of the target for Wynn and Las Vegas Sands. I also like Playa Hotels and Resorts. It is all high end all inclusive resorts/hotels in Mexico and the Caribbean.

Also AirBnB..."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I don't think Marriott is overvalued. 

They've quietly made enormous, positive changes. It's gotten to the point that I don't think people truly understand how big they have become and how many brands are now under their umbrella. They have everything. Cheaper long term stay brands all the way to the ultra luxury, fit for a Dubai sultan and branching into homes and villas. They have quietly become the biggest hotel brand in the world. 

While everyone was looking at AirBnB, Marriott just swooped in and dominated."
03/18/2021,stocks,Check the underlying REITs that own the actual properties. They are still trading at a steep discount I believe.
03/18/2021,stocks,Time for Puts?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Hugely underrated point about airlines and hotels. Business travel absolutely dwarfs leisure travel in volume and dollars. I know someone who used to travel around the world for his job constantly, and his company already told him to expect to be permanently remote.

My one play right now in the airline industry is AerCap, who just bought GE's aircraft leasing division. As many airlines are reducing their fleets and will likely continue to do so, the leasing market should be pretty strong regardless of what happens to the individual airlines. Plus I think the real money is going to be made in air shipping in the next few years, especially with both ground and marine shipping in a bit of a clusterfuck right now."
03/18/2021,stocks,"What would you say is fairly valued? Still feels like everything is absurdly expensive, certainly relative to this time of year last year."

They just beat earnings again yesterday for the third quarter in a row, and are predicted to have a positive net income this year. Seems like it still hasn't made it onto the main radar yet. Credit Suisse just raised their price target on it from $9 to $21. And every analyst currently has it at buy or strong buy.

I’m thinking the catalyst is that their EV sales have been booming and they’re challenging Tesla by name. 

I’m not sure if this is going to moon, but public sentiment might be if Tesla is $600, why is VW only $40. 

Would like some opinions on an exit strategy lol

03/18/2021,stocks,"Zoom out on the chart, and you'll see this shit crashing down eventually like hot shit. There's a large volume spike following the Power day. I watched it, major in this field, and they're behind in technology. This is all old news, an attempt to profit off Tesla's Battery day similar hype. Get in and get the fuck out. This price action is more comparable to GME's movement. Some weird squeeze is going on, and if you don't know what you're doing, don't fomo in, you'll be burned. 

Yes, Volkswagen sells more than Tesla, they're older, more established, and are very popular in the Europe EV market. But this market is not running on fundamentals. RBLX is a good example where r/investing is crying about how overvalued it is, as are other meme stocks, and get left out on the gains. 

This is not GME, if you plan to trade this, set tight stop losses with the ATR."

VW is currently lacking a mid priced sporty and sexy car, like the Model 3 / Y, but the ID 3 / 4 seem to be the better vehicle if you aren’t interested in pure performance and glam. The ID 5 should at least close the gap in sexiness.

Upper class, Audi and Porsche are both going to release a small suv based on a new shared platform, respectively the Q4 e-tron and Macan EV. Especially the new Macan is likely to be a huge success IMO, given how the current one is Porsche’s current best seller and the Taycan is selling well too.

Am just wondering if anyone would be able to suggest any resources or books on preferred shares. Looking for quality material, I have a good understanding of what they are. Just hoping to get a deeper understanding on the topic."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Security Analysis by Graham and Dodd goes into them in detail at the highest level - think academic level.

However, as a side note, Preferred Shares are a lot more rare in the modern era of finance.  They do not see as much use anymore as they did in the old days.  In a simpler, ELI5 example, a preferred share is 50% bond and 50% common stock.  That's the simplest way to think about it.  They sit between bonds and common stock and have attributes of each.

I was looking at Drive Shack about a year ago and this company has preferred shares outstanding.  So, if you need a modern company to look at, or want to look at modern SEC filings with preferred shares and their accounting and everything, you can check out the Drive Shack filings."

I haven't really checked into it in all these years, but I heard a few years ago they were halting trading on the NYSE and moving to Canada's exchange.  Didn't know what that meant, just ignored it.  So I was checking in on my stocks, and noticed on my brokerage details that the shares for BXE is now 10.  Apparently they did multiple restructuring over the years, and looking at my past statements, shares went from 500 to 100, and then later on to 10.  I'm guessing this is now valued at $0, but would like to hear from someone who knows the history and current status of BXE."

2021-03-17 21:37:44,stocks,"Feeling a little down and could use some advice from those more experienced...  Hey All -

I'll try to summarize my current position as best as I can to limit the amount of reading.

I'm new to investing / trading. I just started learning about it about a month ago.  
I am not trying to get rich quick.  
I understand the ideas and basic concepts about not falling to FOMO, not putting more into the market than you can afford to lose, not playing with options unless you understand them, etc.

Most (89.6% to be exact) of my portfolio is in a mutual fund / index fund for the long haul. This is money I plan to supplement retirement with or help my kids with in the future. Not anything I plan to touch for the next 15yrs.

My goal for investing / trading is to hopefully make better returns than I would with the money sitting in the bank and to learn something along the way. I'd say with the remainder of my portfolio - I am trying to use about 3/4th of it for semi-modest plays and 1/4th for the higher-risk / higher reward.

I don't have enough focused time to be able to day trade. But I do have enough time to pay attention to what's going on. I like the idea of having some stock I'd maybe hold onto for a week or two, and some that would be maybe a month or two. Then roll the dice on some options plays.

Well - my timing was pretty horrible. I got in right before the tech sector started to have its almost 2 weeks of red and it looks like I'll be holding for awhile now. *I tried to post my positions below but some tickers are not allowed.* 

I suspect since I'm all red, that my play is to ""never sell at a loss"" and just wait it out...?

My larger positions are down 20% - 30%. I have a few smaller positions down less than 7%. 

***Is there anything else for me to consider? Should I close a couple positions I'm only down less than 7% and use that cash to open up new positions at better entries?***  


I feel stuck just sitting here waiting for months in hopes that my positions turn green or break even. I do have some covered calls out there to pocket some premium, but I'm wondering what others would do if in my position.

2021-03-17 20:50:55,stocks,"Understanding Cost Basis I'm pretty new to trading and I don't understand why my cost basis increased significantly after selling and rebuying a single share.

My question is: why is my total cost basis $100 higher if I bought the share back at a price lower than my initial average ($217.5/share)? What I thought would be a quick $4 profit turned into a $100 loss. I know wash sales can increase cost basis, but I'm pretty sure that only comes into play when a stock is sold for a loss, so that shouldn't apply here."

I know many parents whp signed up due to the great deal but who wont be re-subbing. Their kids wstch more YouTube/tiktok then disney and while cool the Mandalorian isnt enough to keep a sub running. Even nostalgia wore off quickly and sibce Frozen 1 Disney hasn't had any real homeruns. Netflix in comparison is *the backbone* in every home since they got something for everyone from kids to dorky teens to boomers. Disney has to fight Youtube Red, Roblox, HBO and countless others...while netflix stays as the king ""jack of all trades"" entertainment.

2021-03-17 20:14:09,stocks,"Best Practices Hello fellow investors. I have a question regarding best practices regarding stop loss and trailing stop loss orders.

Im obviously new to the wonderful world of stocks but i have absorbed as much information as possible over the last few months. Ive seen some different opinions regarding stop loss and trailing stop loss orders. A few books ive read (Peter Lynch) say never set a stop loss order because you are out of the game for that position if your stock price doesen't increase immediately and you sell. Reading some different online articles ive seen setting a 10 to 20 percent trailing limit order can help prevent losses.

So.. I have a Sofi account and a Fidelity account. Started on Sofi but im opening more positions on Fidelity as I learn what to do and what not to do. Right now as a beginner I have about 2k in 7 positions in the biotech and fintech sectors. They are doing well in my opinion, meaning they are mostly in the green so far.

My theory is; to always buy into a position on the uptick, and to set a stop loss order a few cents above my cost average asap. Then monitor the price of the stock and if its gets above 15% increase then remove the stop loss order and set a 10% trailing stop limit order for the stock.

It makes sense to me because i'm protecting my original investment, and once I see enough gains from a position I can lock it in with a trailing limit order in the hopes that the position will stay green.

I'm just looking for any opinions on whether or not this is a good / bad strategy since i cant stare at the charts all day!

Thanks in advance for any guidance!"

03/18/2021,stocks,Everybody loves a BBW.
03/18/2021,stocks,I still think because of today’s standards Unity Technologies has a lot of room for growth. It could easily shoot up massively short term and remain high for long term. Do you see it potentially being a solid short term play?
03/18/2021,stocks,"what does Unity technologies have to do with Olo? I may not be seeing it. 


Anyways I think Olo will continue to impress with earnings. It's abit overvalued right now at 40-50x revenues (any company is at those ratios) but if it can dip back down to mid 20s ill buy in"
03/18/2021,stocks,Oh crap my bad I accidentally did a reply
03/18/2021,stocks,"Adjusting residential voltage requires transformer replacement.  Many utilities already did that to normalize voltages around 240V.  Before that happened it ranged from 220-250V depending on the utility.  I don't think it's worth the cost to up them only to 250V but the other option would require a separate or new service entrance and transformer with additional secondary taps for 480V or so.

I've seen line upgrades before.  It's no different than replacing damaged poles.  I've seen many existing distribution lines upgraded with new poles and additional line capacity.  It's not hard with an existing easement."
03/18/2021,stocks,Where are you talking about adjusting residential voltage?   That's not a thing!  I work for a utility.   Replacing a damaged line is simply a splice to reconnect.   Changing the voltage is seriously different from simply replacing damaged poles!   Read.  Learn.  It will improve your return when investing.
03/18/2021,stocks,"You obviously didn't read what I posted and it apparently is outside of your technical understanding.

I think we're done here."
03/18/2021,stocks,"although it is not science to agree with it, it is equally ""nothing"" to protest against it as the antithesis to science. (or saying that people who believe it, has fallen for a doomsday cult) The beauty of the system we have in place is that if you take the time to understand the procedures and methodology by which something becomes accepted in the scientific community, you can put  your trust in things that you have read no reports about.

Imagine a school-board-meeting where we discuss what we should do about the asbestos in the roof - right now, to me, you are the guy telling everyone that no one knows if asbestos is really that dangerous, and that people shouldn't be alarmists, cause just blindly agreeing with the scientists is the antithesis to science. we need to read the asbestos reports ourselves. But most of us are perfectly fine to accept that asbestos is dangerous, simply because that is the scientific consensus - but we understand science enough to know what it takes to get to a scientific consensus, and understand how hard scientists work to disprove themselves and each other.

It's hard for me to believe that you apply this standard of skepticism in other areas of your life. That's why I'm reacting a bit strongly to your comments."
03/18/2021,stocks,I just started trading in February and all of my stocks are red so far. 😬
03/18/2021,stocks,"You bought a hot stock at the all time high without research. Now you complain that it’s gone down during a time where all high growth companies went down dramatically. Because of that, the company must be garbage. Seems legit."
03/18/2021,stocks,Every stock pick I make is a bad pick. Go figure! I’ll stick to VOO from now on lol
03/18/2021,stocks,all of them
03/18/2021,stocks,Your first mistake is listening to MF...
03/18/2021,stocks,Sold some of my bank stocks for a Nasdaq ETF 😓
03/18/2021,stocks,ICLN will be down this year. What do the youngins say? HODL. I believe the worst dip this year will take it to 18/19. Oh well.
03/18/2021,stocks,"XL, Plug, NGA, AI, GIK .... wait that’s my whole portfolio FML."
03/18/2021,stocks,Nvda and Costco
03/18/2021,stocks,Ishares global clean energy
03/18/2021,stocks,TAN. Was slowly sinking even before the correction. Dropped like 30% more and is very slow on the recovery. Still holding this and some other clean energy stocks in hopes Biden makes another statement so I can dump them.
03/18/2021,stocks,TRCH at 3.1 not expecting them to almost intentionally fuck their shareholders
03/18/2021,stocks,You have to Watch those SNEEKY professionals on How they say Buy a stock.... the FINE PRINT below will say like “BUY LMND with tiny print ‘below $75’.
03/18/2021,stocks,"GRCV. It did a reverse split of 2500 to 1. I had $75/10k shares and now my 4 shares are worth $8. It got down to $1 at one point but I’m not selling it for that loss, no point."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I almost bought I to lemonade, but I went to the estimator tool and the minimum amount of miles was more expensive than my current insurance so I decided not to. They aren’t quite competitive yet IMO."
03/18/2021,stocks,"$ACES ALPS Clean Energy ETF. I bought in mid-January for $95.84 a share.

Today it closed at $77.55. It's the first time I've bought an ETF as I've historically ""created my own ETF"" by just buying individual shares of the companies I was interested in. I liked $ACES because it focused on North American Clean Energy companies and gave me exposure to some strong players in the sector.

I can't decide if I just bought during a time when green energy was being hyped to an extreme and if I just got in too high, or if it was just a bad pick. I suppose if I liked it at $95.84, then I should really like it at $77.55. (Insert shoulder shrug here.)

Buying opportunity to DCA...or...bad pick?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"From a % it’s NPA, from a $ it’s ARKF 

Not getting killed on either - wasn’t a bad month"
03/18/2021,stocks,"NAKD is a weird one for me, really inactive preformance then all of a sudden hikes, then crashes back to all time low and inactivity for another 2 months"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I know I’m stupid but I don’t think I have any. I’m good with every stock I have. I might be down $1 but I’m probably up $50k. I was out before the recent red and did ok. 

I’m up. 

I hold some bags but I became positive after a year selling cc’s I can’t remember my last loss. I’m not done yet. I try to make money all the time."

03/18/2021,stocks,pltr baba u tm17. Have a feeling baba will bounce tho.
03/18/2021,stocks,WMT
03/18/2021,stocks,"Very late to the party, but mine is IPOF. It was holding steady at 15 for so long that I thought it was stable. How wrong I was. I'll probably be bagholding until a target is announced. Its a SPAC for anyone who doesnt know."
03/18/2021,stocks,AWK thought I was buying a safe stable dividend payor.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Regi @ $94.01 

It's never coming back is it"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I bought RTP @ $13.64.... still hoping for it to *take off*....


......***YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH***"
03/18/2021,stocks,HIMS and RICE warrants. Good times
03/18/2021,stocks,"I sold a 25p on WKHS 2 hours before usps annouced the deal with OSK. I got $3.22 for the put and sold more puts on it on it's way up for another $2 realized. Breakeven is just below $20 on the April expiry. I've had a few trades go wrong, but not this bad this quick lmao"
03/18/2021,stocks,CHPT and PLUG but I’m up on them overall
03/18/2021,stocks,Zoom! I bought that shit right before Texas announced they were opening up and right before the tech sell off

03/18/2021,stocks,Sold gme a day before it mooned. Paper hands I guess. Didn’t loose much so not that upset about it. Always another W out there.
03/18/2021,stocks,ASXC! Fuck that shit!!!
03/18/2021,stocks,I made my first investment in VWS at 163 and after some weeks it went down to 140. It's not a bad company but I think it wont reach the buying price for a LONG time

03/18/2021,stocks,"I play in the S P A C world so warrants I bought for a MJ S P A C, it's going to trade OTC after merging, between the S P A C drawback + being listed OTC, I'm down 60%"

03/18/2021,stocks,"Bevcanna Enterprises INC

Pennystock. DD reddit looked promising. To the Moon. Got some 1+ euro. Within a day down to 60 cents. Dived into the company. 2 employés! Dammit! 200 banana’s sitting there now. 

And bought them true Frankfurt market where i have to pay 8 euro fee. So even bringing average down is a pain. So the struggle is real. 

But learned my lesson! ;-)"
03/18/2021,stocks,Apple bought it at ath. Cause i was convinced they are a solid company that will keep performing with enough cash to weather any storm.
03/18/2021,stocks,I have a love-hate relationship with AAPL
03/18/2021,stocks,I think your first mistake was listening to Motley Fool.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Shorted Tesla right before their S&P inclusion.

Still a wildly overvalued stock, but I’m not looking to get run over by that freight train again. 

I wish Burry and those still in the game well."

03/18/2021,stocks,PVDG
03/18/2021,stocks,really? i actually bought into ICLN recently and plan for it for a slow accumulation in shares over time. cost average is under 25. with the current administration i think green energy will do well. this is a years from now hold and i have that in mind when i got it
03/18/2021,stocks,$ICLN shifts their holdings around ... plenty of time and room for it to run
03/18/2021,stocks,Yeah...you know it wasnt gonna work out when reddit was hyping it so much and the main reasoning being Biden was going to be president and he likes clean energy lol.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I've been averaging down. My biggest red right now, but I'm in for years - not months. I still like the stock."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Stay in the long run and it’ll go up again. Renewable energy is the future. Once Biden fixes the fuck ups that Trump caused with the economy and COVID-19, he’ll shift his focus to green energy. Stay chill and hold."
03/18/2021,stocks,This and FAN are fuckbois
03/18/2021,stocks,Correct! ICLN wrecked me as well
03/18/2021,stocks,"I have honestly discovered that if I invest in companies I use, they are probably going to succeed.  I am not a day trader.  I invest for long terms.  Therefore, I have bought into Corsair.  I am break even so far on it, but I am a strong proponent of Corsair products.  In my current machine, I have Corsair brand RAM, case, and even the power supply!  So, I am holding onto it.

HBO Max... love it!  So, I invested in $T because AT&T owns them.  They are not price gouging movies for $30 like Disney+.  Instead, they are including the movies with the service, and I think it is going to work to get new subscribers.

AMC Theaters.  I bought in at $5.00 a share because as soon as theaters really start opening back up, it will remain stable.  (I just sold AMC, though.  I am probably going to just put more into $T for now.)  However, these two play well together in ways that other companies may not.

Every time I have avoided investing in companies whose products I use, I have missed out.  So, Corsair I think it still a good call if you are okay with holding onto it for over a year or two while throwing some money into it occasionally."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Traded both of these this year for a win, but I just got lucky and got out ahead of the falls just because my short options hit 50% p/l and I closed them. 

PTON took me for a ride down though."
03/18/2021,stocks,Oh man are you me? Hopefully once the rate FUD dies down we’ll be back to PLTR in the 30s and CRSR in the 40s (at least my August calls in both those names hope so)
03/18/2021,stocks,"OP said worst picks, not best. I used this as an opportunity to add more PLTR that I otherwise wouldn't have. All about the long term here."
03/18/2021,stocks,I think CRSR will benefit soon when LANs and gaming events/conventions open up again.
03/18/2021,stocks,Same F
03/18/2021,stocks,That one is odd to me considering they’ve performed well and their last earnings report was strong. I guess the market doesn’t think the covid fueled gaming surge will last but I see the gaming sector being absolutely massive 5-10 years from now
03/18/2021,stocks,$38 here.  Going to average down if it drops a bit more.
03/18/2021,stocks,Fuck FUBO
03/18/2021,stocks,"Same here, but with NIO for me. 

Still HODL though. Will see how high it goes in 7-10 years time"
03/18/2021,stocks,Some of their premium picks have worked out fantastically: two I distinctly remember are Shopify at $20 and Trade Desk at $40.
03/18/2021,stocks,You gotta give VGAC time to shine.
03/18/2021,stocks,"This whole thread is unbelievably stupid. People complaining about investing ETFs and stocks like Costco because it went down 1 month after buying. If you are buying stocks like those for short term gains you are doing it wrong. Also, nearly everything is down right now.

I swear this sub is like Wallstreetbets without the humor."
03/18/2021,stocks,"It’s been a tough several weeks. I’ve received flack for talking poorly about Lemonade, but of all the stocks nothing has lost 45% of its value in days and remained completely depressed."
03/18/2021,stocks,Exactly. Kind of ties into the MF rec being hot garbage if I must say so myself. It was less than 48 hours from asshats rec that it dropped 50%
03/18/2021,stocks,Funny... Costco is one of my highest conviction stocks after recently buying it at $310
03/18/2021,stocks,I bought Cost two weeks ago and it's up 10%
03/18/2021,stocks,"The forward PE is 22 with a $570 average price target. It’s a fantastic company, you’ll be fine. Not the calls"
03/18/2021,stocks,FWIW thermo is dumping massive amounts of money into the research triangle. We currently have about 5 active contracts with them alone. I understand this doesnt help your calls but I wouldnt have any problem with these guys long term. Same for MRK
03/18/2021,stocks,Ouch. Good luck digging out.
03/18/2021,stocks,ARKK will be fine. Don’t worry about it. It’ll just be a couple months
03/18/2021,stocks,i bought a few shares after this huge tech sell off. long term hold ferrrr sherrr like all my etf’s i buy
03/18/2021,stocks,I’m in TLRY at $65 🙈
03/18/2021,stocks,"Just curious, why is anyone buying TLRY when APHA is still cheaper than the merger's stock conversion rate?"
03/18/2021,stocks,Why did you sell it? I think it’s heading to 50 soon.
03/18/2021,stocks,I guess I got lucky buying at 8. I do like them long term tho
03/18/2021,stocks,I believe in CPNG and bought a little in case it mooned for some reason. This week and next week will probably be the time to average down
03/18/2021,stocks,I plan on buying on Friday. IIRC a lockup date is this week. So may drop some more.
03/18/2021,stocks,Clawing back into the game.
03/18/2021,stocks,"> below $75.

Haha, very true. The below caveat also probably means 4 years ago or right after the next pandemic begins."
03/18/2021,stocks,"In another evaluation elsewhere, it was predicted they will be purchased or bought out long before the stock go anywhere meaningful."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Seems like clean energy, fuel/energy sources, etc. aren’t a bad long play. Guess it’s just picking the wheat from the chaff though in the early stages."
03/18/2021,stocks,Ask for a refund :(
03/18/2021,stocks,Oh no! Hopefully you have been playing the dips so far at least
03/18/2021,stocks,"Oh, ouch. Has lost almost 100% of it value since Mar 2020. Damn."
03/18/2021,stocks,That's still true...
03/18/2021,stocks,Apple is a good hold. They have such intimate access to people’s lives would be surprised if their stock went anywhere negative.
03/18/2021,stocks,ZSAN club! I’m stuck holding the bag too. At this point I’m in it for the long haul. Or until I can average down to $1.10 and close it out when it has a spike.
03/18/2021,stocks,Hope you didn’t load up with 100K at .098. Sounds about like my attempts at penny stocks
03/18/2021,stocks,Did the same. Glad I did it.
03/18/2021,stocks,"These people are crazy. Like did they really expect an ETF to make 2x gains in a month? 

ICLN has always been a long term play (as in years) that's going to be more volatile because it's in an emerging industry. You don't invest in something like this because you think you will make a quick buck, you invest in it because you think clean energy will be huge years from now."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm gonna hold into June, at least. Biden is currently preoccupied with normalizing the economy that has been heavily damaged by the pandemic. He would have to suck up a lot of backlash if he were to push his platform before things have gone back to normal. There will be good news to come for green energy."
03/18/2021,stocks,So did you hold for an year? Or were you ok with the STCGT?
03/18/2021,stocks,That’s sort of an unfair criticism don’t you think? Plug for example is far from sentiment with growth targeting emerging Asian (SK Group partnership) and European (Renault) markets. People are obsessed with value but have failed to realize that the comparable energy “value” plays like oil have been subsidized (and continue to be subsidized) for decades to the tune of ~20 trillion dollars; give a fair shake to the inevitable renewable platforms and watch them usurp in the next couple of decades like we NEED them to.
03/18/2021,stocks,"You are correct in that clean energy is the future, but which companies that will be dominating that sector.  People continue to throw money at anything that has ""green"" possibilities without ever looking at the product.  There are many legacy or boomer companies that have huge research departments that will more likely absorb much of the green energy companies due to their wealth.  Most of the companies in ICLN aren't worth 25% of their current price."
03/18/2021,stocks,Good luck! Their top holding reported miscalculating financials...that would scare the hell out of me if I were still in the stock.
03/18/2021,stocks,"ICLN isn’t even majority American holdings, you do realize that right? So your Biden theory is a little silly. There are way better green energy ETFs that are American based if you’re basing your opinion on Joe Biden driving the price up."
03/18/2021,stocks,"If you have legit leaps, then I wouldn’t worry, unless you bought your leaps a year ago."
03/18/2021,stocks,"The thing that gives me pause about PLTR is that they have been playing the long game for a long time.  They're not a brand new startup; we had Palantir reps with us on-site when I was in Afghanistan in 2010 trying to sell us the same product they are still pushing.  Not saying it's a bad product, but they've had a long runway already."
03/18/2021,stocks,LOL if you think T will be anything other than a money pit (dividends included)
03/18/2021,stocks,"I thought the same, and I thought if even Disney can fucking go up forever with a streaming service $T must be able to. Boy was I fucking wrong, how much opportunity cost have I paid for that one it hurts to think about."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Smaller companies can warrant higher PEs, I think CRSR is overvalued but comparing it to LOGI simply based on PE is shortsighted.  Also 20% short is nothing."
03/18/2021,stocks,"It's absolutely too early to judge. It's an ETF in an emerging industry, it's a long term play. Long term means years, maybe a decade. 

Did these people expect ICLN to 2x in one month?"
03/18/2021,stocks,I bought 100 @ 45 and it’s not one of my primary positions; I’m going to hold until it at least breaks even just as a reminder to do more DD.
03/18/2021,stocks,Is there another lockup ending?  I saw one ended in December.  I bought some shares under $30
03/18/2021,stocks,They’re gonna be fine.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I disagree. I've followed (read) Motley since the late 90s (when I was in hs) and have been using them since 2017. Not all of their picks will rise, but if you pay attention to the ones you think sound good after reading TMF info and researching a bit, most of their picks have been absolutely great for me (TTD #1 💙, ZM, AAPL, KMX, TDOC, CRWD, ATVI, APPN, NVTA, PINS). My little play account went from 8,500 (3/2020) to 45k now. All but one pick of my play account is from TMF. I recommend them wholeheartedly... Best $200  spent on their stock advisor service.

Oh and I did buy LMND at their recommendation. Not the best pick *currently*.... but TMF does recommend 3-5 year holding period. 

Also, I ignore their upsell emails. They are still a business who wants to sell. LOL"
03/18/2021,stocks,Hello SEC? I bought this eco green stock ICLN and it doesn't go green every day. I need a refund.
03/18/2021,stocks,I sold my VGAC after learning the spac holds just 11% of the company.
03/18/2021,stocks,I had a buy limit trigger at $10.50 to average down from $13.
03/18/2021,stocks,"Thanks and likewise. I'm with you - I love the product and think they could be a gamechanger. Personally speaking, I probably entered at a price where they would need to nail everything and take a pretty substantial (bordering on unrealistic) market share to validate. I'm in it for the long term, so nothing to do now but enjoy the ride and see where they go in the future."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah, it's gotten really bad. There's far too many uneducated 'investors' who have no clue what investing what they're doing or what they're buying. That's how we end up with posts like this one, that is somehow 92% upvoted, and where almost all comments are complaints about a stock that is currently red, which they were promised to make them instant returns. It's actually pretty pervasive, this idea that the stock market right now is just free money."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Another vote for COST. I bought after someone on here recommended and I did the bare minimum of checking it out. Thank goodness just one share, but bought at $335, and it just cratered. Never again will I follow the advice of a random Reddit post!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I like it, but my long term holding (right now) for that space is in Danaher.  Keeping it on my watch list.  I think the dip is overdone and may do some longer term calls.  Right now just watching and doing a bit more research."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I wasn't convinced it had a lot more upside. It's been going up for a while, but eventually it's going to correct itself, so I wanted to get out before that happened.

It may come back to bite me, but that was my logic at least."
03/18/2021,stocks,"""Fortunately i realized before making a loss."". 
  
I don't expect the stock to drop much: the business should have a great few years. but also don't expect it to grow much because of what is already priced in."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yep I agree it will be dominant in the hotel industry and have huge business growth: and that's why the market cap is already far greater than any competitor. 

 Unless it's going to enter some new industry I struggle to see further catalysts to increase its valuation."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah, was trying to predict a crash"
03/18/2021,stocks,I know but goddamnit i timed that ath perfectly hahaha.
03/18/2021,stocks,I mean...ya'll bought at the top. PLUG is its biggest holding. I bought PLUG at $6 and sold at $63 in January. ICLN is great.
03/18/2021,stocks,Yeah he must be preoccupied I haven’t seen him since the campaign and he never takes questions.

03/18/2021,stocks,"No it's not unfair at all. People are buying green energy stocks because they ""believe it will be huge in the future"". No shit, I believe that too. However, when companies are already priced like it's 2030 with 10 years of revenue and growth missing, you aren't going to make much of a profit long term. You can see that with no further devling by seeing green energy stocks give more than 100% gains in the last year with no real improvement.

The shares were more for security, so I could hold more longer term.

Getting in on what will grow and has ample room to IS investing. Your myopic view seems to be more of traders mentality. Are you seriously trying to say that the prices the hydrogen companies are at already include their future values when the hydrogen market is mature? That’s just wrong. Literally looking at how massive oil is (3.3 trillion in 2019), if we said energy demands didn’t increase in the future (which they definitely will), that’s 3.3 trillion to be replaced with renewables. Let’s say hydrogen only take up 20% of that, that’s 660 billion available for hydrogen. Plug, ballad, bloom energy, itm, fuel cell have a combined market cap of $45B, or ~7% of the static and charitable 660 billion estimate I provided.

They aren’t my only plays, but to discount them when the story makes sense and you see actual deals being made is folly. Enjoy your safe blue chip prospects with less opportunity for growth; every pick looks stupid until it works out, and I think the basis of my choice is sound—you can’t even argue it, you’re just saying that RIGHT NOW they aren’t making a profit when I’ve explained to you just how dynamic the energy sector is and how poised these companies are to expand massively by inevitability (be it solar, wind, hydrogen, etc).

03/18/2021,stocks,"No you don't fundamentally disagree, you just disagree lmao. As you haven't made one argument based on fundamentals of the stock, you are gambling. Thats fine and dandy, but there are many other better opportunities that ARE fairly valued and have huge potential to grow in the next 10 years. 

That's the difference between trading on fundamentals and not. Both are looking at longer term prospects, but look at the outcomes scenarios. 

- A company is fairly valued or undervalued currently in their sector, and pays a small dividend, has good revenue, low debt, low valuations. If the stock goes up like you project it will, great. If the projections don't go like you think it will, the stock will probably still go up somewhat if it has a good business model, or will stay pretty steady and you just keep the dividend. If the market crashes then it will likely still be okay due to already low valuations and low debt, so it won't get butt fucked. 

- A company is overvalued (by a ton), pays no dividend, is losing money every year, has bad debt, high valuations, and a TON of exuberance from traders. If the stock goes up, some crazy shit happens like you think it will, then the stock will go up, but remember, the higher the valuations, the lower the return will be. If not much happens, the stock will become increasingly fucked as everyone sees it still isn't making profit, debt is getting bigger, it was only going up because of exuberance and once that's gone it's gone and the stock will crash. Scenario 3, a market crash will cause a company with ludicrous valuations with no fundamentals to be the first in the grave. The stock will drop to the floor. 

That is investing and why you do not want to put money in stocks like this based on some future prospects that may or may not happen. It's not a long term play unless you are okay with all 3 scenarios and are prepared for it. There are plenty of fairly valued plays out there."

Expecting renewables to replace fossil fuel for energy demand is not gambling, wtf are you on? It’s the timeline that we can argue, not the reality of if this will happen. Putting all of your money on any one stock is never a good move, but they have sector ETFs to limit volatility (both risk and reward). I think PLUG is poised to emerge dominant in the hydrogen sector. I already explain to you the $3.3T market (from 2019) that has to be replaced by renewable in my life time or we’re fucked (how about that binary? Sensationalized?)
Quit treating all sectors and companies as the same thing. The writing is on the wall and there is literally no scenario where fossil fuels continue there hegemony on the energy sector, they’re a dirty, FINITE resource that is artificially propped up anyways. Nothing sounds sustainable like that 😂

Let’s also not pretend we’re in a free market society where the best business models always thrive. We’re in a state capilist system and political winds will dominate which companies are allowed to thrive. Idk about you but the zero emission by 2050 target sounds like a nail in the coffin to carbon-positive feedstocks. How are you seriously talking about the generality of stock fundamentals without considering the insane catalyst we’re on top of? Also, I already walked you through how small even these OvErVaLuEd stocks are with respect to the energy sector they’ll come to dominate. Learn the difference between price and value.

Would it be possible to modify it to identify stocks that are undervalued so to get in early before it pops over the ATH? once it’s over ATH you can only gain so much before it drops so it can be risky even with stop loss.

Based on this data, 50% of the gains achieve 8.9% or better. This gives you an expected value of 4.46%.

BUT, that's not actually the best expected value. If you compare gains to the likelihood of achieving those gains, your sell limit should actually be 11.7% which has likelihood of 41.4% chance (based on same dataset). This gives you an expected value of 4.82%.

It took an average of 9 days to achieve 11.7% or higher gains."
03/18/2021,stocks,Is there a tutorial on how I can use this? your methodology sounds reasonable and I would like to try this but it overwhelms me and I'm not sure where to look and start first. thank you for your efforts.
03/18/2021,stocks,Grrrr I just wanna see this and it won’t work
03/18/2021,stocks,"Why ""under"" 500? If the score is representative of popularity / mentions wouldn't you want the score that is highest with the stock that hasn't popped yet?"

1.  Does the sell price trigger look at pre and post market hours.  Since some brokers have different times, its hard to know when you can actually sell.

2.  When the market tanked at the end of February and then dumped again in early March, did your success rate fall?  Are you winning more when the market is winning?

3.  How often do you get a ""buy"" alert  to go into a stock?

4.  If you lowered your ""take profit"" to 10%, how much success above 75% do you achieve?"

03/18/2021,stocks,This is awesome.   Have an upvote!
03/18/2021,stocks,Is the ELIF version of this to find tickers from unbias or the google sheet with a reddit score of 250-500 and low stock growth % and make sure they’re legit
03/18/2021,stocks,"So on unbias is there a way to pick a ticker and sort by which subreddits mentioned it the most? For example, ticker ACN looks like a potential candidate. 

Reddit score 254

13.39% score change in past 24 hours

Stock Change % 0.29

&#x200B;

It would be nice to see if it was mentioned across multiple subreddits easily instead of having to filter for the subreddits one by one."
03/18/2021,stocks,Do I have to join Github to use it?
03/18/2021,stocks,Great point. That's the kind of thing I look for when I'm doing a little deeper dives on my short list. If they look like bots I cross those off
03/18/2021,stocks,Might want to report this to Reddit admins. The SEC would be really interested in this.
03/18/2021,stocks,Great find. I'm looking on Unbias Stock but I can't quite figure out how you determined they had the same amount of mentions every single day. Where did you find that info? Thank you!
03/18/2021,stocks,"I am a new trader as well but it sounds like you are smarter than me lol, would you mind clarifying?

what I am understanding is that OP built a 'scraper tracker' and that tracker found that unbias stock was a good scraper. and that the most effective way of using that scraper is scraping all subs on reddit, and then finding a ticker with a sub 500 score with a good increase in score and a small increase in price and then buying shares from that ticker and selling at 15%? am I missing something?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"If the mob shows it can be led, the money will corrupt the leaders."
03/18/2021,stocks,You try explaining to this sub that going balls in on a stock or etf thats just hit its all time high is a bad idea and see how it goes. Its always a bad idea but pullbacks and corrections dont exist here until they happen.
03/18/2021,stocks,argument to buy after the ATH.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm stupid. Does this automatically make a personal copy for myself, or do I have to do something else after clicking it?"
03/18/2021,stocks,🤣
03/18/2021,stocks,"I did a bit in the beginning but wasn't having good results, probably because the data wasn't complete enough to make good picks. I think after I have another month of data I'll be comfortable enough to use it for buying weeklies"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I agree - not much better than a coin flip. I'm tracking it to see what trends come out of it, but as for the first few weeks it doesn't seem like a great strategy"
03/18/2021,stocks,"So it's not just me?? Sure, it's an impressive amount of work, but I'm not getting excited about a stock that is more than likely going to dip right after I bought it and may or may not rise a short time after. Especially not for a five percent gain!

Even the OP admits it's a hit or miss for him."
03/18/2021,stocks,"There's no set number, It depends on the day and tickers. Monday I bought 5, spending $1000 each. Tuesday 3 of them hit 15% and I sold, then bought 2 more. Today one is at 10%, another at 3%, and another at -1.5%. I'll hold them until they hit 15% or until 5 days. At 5 days I'll sell no matter what.


After that I'll look at what else is popping up that day, do some Reddit searches to see what everyone is bullish on, and pick up any that seem to stand out. There's no clear sign that says ""BUY THIS STOCK!"", so in the end you still have to go by feel a little bit. This spreadsheet just narrows the tickers down to a reasonable amount

In the beginning I was buying a ton at $100 each to to test strategies"
03/18/2021,stocks,"It's mainly due to ARKK, FNGU, and a few other tech stocks. I have LEAPs on them. Fidelity is my long term hold stocks so it moves with my market. My RH is what I play with all throughout the day"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah it's pretty hilarious, I found that WH and a few other two letter stocks had a bump corresponding to the sentiment rising. WH is used in posts about the white house, the others were posts about a recent Canadian election, I guess their parties have two letter acronyms that are also ticker symbols lol"

03/18/2021,stocks,"I'll try make a copy today, it's giving me a hard time loading since Google doesn't seem to be able to support sharing more than a few people."
03/18/2021,stocks,"This is a valid point and great analysis. I considered this, but I figured I'd go for the slightly less-risky option even if it means smaller gains.

But this is awesome info, thank you for it! I will keep it in mind"
03/18/2021,stocks,I'm going to start looking into github tomorrow so we don't have to deal with Google sheets
03/18/2021,stocks,"That's what I expected to find too, but it turns out that by the time it gets mentioned and popular enough to hit the higher categories it has already popped"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Signal: New High

Top gainer means it had the highest percentage increase. I'm sure that can be valuable too but I don't use it"
03/18/2021,stocks,"My data tracking has shown me that most chart traders aren't any better than guessing. Past performance is not an indicator of future behavior, and chart analysis is just astrology for stocks"
03/18/2021,stocks,"RMBL and UAL. I'm not sure what they have in common, I actually don't look at the companies themselves - just the sentiment. I expect that some will lose, so I buy shares so that I can drop them after 5 days for small (1% - 2%) losses"
03/18/2021,stocks,"After I paste the ticker, date, and reddit scores everything else is automatic through functions. Google just struggles when too many people are in the sheet"

03/18/2021,stocks,"1. Since Google sheets only tracks during market hours that's all it shows

2. When the market tanked it was pretty interesting - the data heavily leaned toward the 500 category only. I think there was just a smaller pool of what was successful at the time

3. There's nothing as clear as an alert, the data really just helps you narrow it down to a solid 3 - 6 tickers. After that I search reddit for those tickers and see which ones give me the best feeling

4. I'm betting it'd be about a 30% improvement since the average % increase for those categories is 15%. So if you're happy taking 10% profit (which is great) then you're nailing 1/3 more"
03/18/2021,stocks,Why?
03/18/2021,stocks,"How would it hinder me? Sharing it doesn't change anything about the data.

As for why, partly I'm just trying to help and partly I want to see if anyone has any cool ideas about the data that I haven't thought of"
03/18/2021,stocks,Sometimes it does. When I catch those I'll delete them from the list
03/18/2021,stocks,"That's basically it. Use Unbias to narrow down a list, then do some searching on reddit to see which ones are the most bullish across multiple subs and which give you the best feeling"

03/18/2021,stocks,"I would expect the owners of Unbiased Stocks to have a time series. If they're displaying historical numbers over 7 days, you'd think they would maintain a longer time series.

Could probably contact them about it. Then you'd be able to do more straightforward analysis (i.e. backtesting strategies like holding top 50 highest scored stocks for a month, then reforming the portfolio)."
03/18/2021,stocks,I have been unable to open or Download the document. Not sure what the issue is on my end? Has anyone else had a issue?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Thank you for this! It is much appreciated! When you’re looking in Unbiastock, what sub in Reddit do you choose? Or do you just choose the “All” option?

03/18/2021,stocks,"I flipped through the time frames, 24, 48 Hours, and 7 days and switched between All and the different subreddits. If you go through the pages there will be large blocks of stocks with the same mentions that day, and the day before. Honestly, taking a closer look, there's a lot more than just those stocks. While I'll try and stay away from the obvious ones, the ones that are less obvious because they are also mentioned by random people get harder to sift through. Here's another set over a 7 day period:

Again, all Blackrock. Several has them listed as the largest institutional holder. I'm probably missing a lot of other stocks they are trying to get people to buy.

Edit: If you also eliminate all the other fields so show average reddit karma next to the mentions, you'll see the average reddit karma levels are exactly the same too... Now it is way too obvious...

03/18/2021,stocks,I haven't had a chance to look at the sheet (because too many people are trying to accessing it.. lol) but had a quick question if you don't mind. What price is used as the base for calculating the 15% or 5% increase? Is it the ATH or something else?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Which time horizon do you query for this? When you say the stock has only gone up 5%, is that referring to the stock change % column? 

Like $SLNO for example. It's listed as +3.05% so in theory has another 12% to climb?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"What time frame are you using for the percentage increase? I.e. is the 5-15% increase over the last day, week, month etc?

Really appreciate the insight btw, fantastic post. Just wish I could access the spreadsheet"
03/18/2021,stocks,Just curious. What did you buy based on this during the big downturn earlier this month? Banks and energy?
03/18/2021,stocks,Is that 15% from when you bought or 15% from when they first popped up?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Hey OP you're the best. I am a new trader and I was hoping you wouldn't mind clarifying what it is exactly you have done here lol

it's my understanding that your spread sheet has found that the most effective way of using Unbias Stock is scraping all subs on reddit, and then finding a ticker with a sub 500 score with a good increase in score and a small increase in price and then buying shares from that ticker and selling at 15%? Is that correct?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Hi, even newer trader here, not sure where you got the 160/137 from?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"That's correct. If you're able to look at the spreadsheet, you'll see that OP calculated that stocks from Unbias with a reddit score of 250-500 had the highest number of stocks being profitable (they hit a price higher than the price they were bought at) and on average were able to reach a price point 14.5% higher than the buy price.

Of course, before he buys any of the tickers that match his score criteria, he does a quick reddit search to see what's being said about it. Reddit has been flooded with bots that only exist to pump certain tickers, and he says he avoids these because he doesn't believe the bullish sentiment behind them is genuine. EG anyone pumping Silver.

I think the most important lesson from OP's strategy is that he sets a sell price (15%) and does *not* deviate from it unless it exceeds his timeframe for the trade (5 days.) He sticks to his strategy and takes his profits. Most new traders lose money on winning trades because they're unwilling to sell while they're up.

I'm a newer trader myself and have so far been unsuccessful with my own strategies, so I'm doing a live run of OP's strategy and keeping my position sizes to a single share. I don't mind losing a few bucks if it means testing a potential winning strategy."

All day I've been sitting here thinking WTF, all this work and you're not making any money????"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Interesting idea... I bet you could take the average percentage increase as an indicator of when it's about to drop, and then look at how much it tends to drop right after"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Using my sheets led me to UWMC about a week ago (you can see in my post history). I picked it up for $8.16 and hit 15%+ a few days later. I didn't sell since I'm hoping it'll hit $10, but that was pretty standard for the data I've been seeing"
03/18/2021,stocks,That's good to know - I was operating under a false assumption!
03/18/2021,stocks,Do you look at their volume and choose only in the millions?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Nope, I go 100% off sentiment. I don't look into the companies at all, I just look for movement.

So got instance, last week UWMC popped up in the under 250 category. The average % increase for that category was 17% at the time but the stock had only recently gone up about 3% so it had room to grow.


So I bought in and a few days later I was up 15%. I still have no idea what the company does, or most of the others I buy. I'm just interested in how much attention they're getting from everyone else."
03/18/2021,stocks,"That's interesting, I'll have to find a way to write that into it. I don't think it'd be too hard. Find stocks with an upward trend that is within 5% of its ATH, for instance"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Based on the data (and following it with my real world money) I've learned that the sweet spot seems to be:

1. Stocks with a reddit score of under 500
2. They average a 15% return within an average of 6 days

So I sell at 10% - 15% gains within the first week. After that week I sell at whatever the price is, even if it's a loss. The rest of the categories are not as profitable which indicates that it's not worth bag holding in hopes it'll come back, because it rarely does (at least within the timeframe I've been tracking). So I move on and look for the next buy. I don't expect them all to be winners, so selling some at a slight loss is part of the strategy"
03/18/2021,stocks,I just may
03/18/2021,stocks,I guess the way around this would be to just hold a shit load of shares so you can have some you can sell at a certain price target and the other stash to sell CCs?
03/18/2021,stocks,"Only 56% are up after 5 days or so, right? Which is a coin toss. In a rising market, most stocks will be up 5-8 days from now. Maybe not by as much as 15% so that makes this sifting valuable. But how did you get a 75% success rate? Was it all from these sentiment searches and gut feel?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Thanks so much, will prob make more sense after I can look at your spreadsheet!"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Unable to open or download, not sure why?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm doing well with the sentiment trading part - pretty consistently 10% - 15% gains, and the ones that didn't have gains I only lost 1% - 3%. The ATH stuff, not so much"
03/18/2021,stocks,"
OP what formula do I use to get the average %?"
03/18/2021,stocks,What should I go to right now? What you entering in for stocks?
03/18/2021,stocks,Just means its “1 year high”. Maybe you can toy with longer ranges or true ATH
03/18/2021,stocks,"Let me see if I understand this: 
IPOE Reddit score 243 score change 68.75%   stock change 3.79% this would be something to watch or would you buy it?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Now I understand that part. Thanks for the clarification. 

One more thing: are you using the week view or day view?  It changes the Reddit score accordingly."
03/18/2021,stocks,If you guys are going to collaborate on this then let me know. I need to learn git for work anyway and i'm trying to follow what you were doing on your sheet.
03/18/2021,stocks,"how much premium are you expecting to make on a 5dte cc that's 10% otm? then it pops and you either lose money to buy it back so you can sell the shares or it pops and then falls and now you've lost your gain but gotten a small premium?

the options play here is to buy calls instead of shares on what you predict will pop. leverage!"
03/18/2021,stocks,Placing limit sells might be too simple a strategy. You’d actually want to look at the expected gains (probability of success x estimated gains). It may be that holding on the the stock a few days longer will give you higher expected returns even though the likelihood is lower than 50%
03/18/2021,stocks,Also the 56% is if OP bought every stock that fit the criteria of below AVG gains. OP is only buying a subset of those
03/18/2021,stocks,"AIEQ and BUZZ are closely tracking each other over the couple of weeks that BUZZ has existed.

AIEQ tracked SPY until early November, when it went on a 30% tear above SPY until the correction started in mid-February. It looks to have a beta between 2 and 3 otherwise.

Hypothesis: If they can buy their own *or each others'* shares, talking about them could put them into a positive-feedback loop, causing infinite gain."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I do it in pivot tables, but if I was doing it manually I'd do AVERAGE(range of %s)"
03/18/2021,stocks,Honestly I haven't looked into anything today since I'm waiting on the ones I bought the last couple days
03/18/2021,stocks,"It'd definitely be on my short list! Generally speaking I'd expect something with that score to hit 10% - 15% gains in the next week or so. My next step would be to do a real world test and search the ticker on reddit. If there are a bunch of different posts in different subs and everyone seems bullish then I'd buy.

Since the score is low don't expect a ton of comments, you're looking for a wide range of groups bringing it up"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Day view, since the return percentages show better payoff periods of days rather than weeks"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Maybe target something a bit further out of the money, a number you wouldn't mind selling some shares at. It's very possible you could keep selling covered calls for 6 months or so where the strikes you choose never hit. So you're basically just making a steady income for the time being versus just letting ur shares sit there."
03/18/2021,stocks,I wonder if I could drop these into a Portfolio on VectorVest and have a use a technical indicator to tell me End of Day whether or not to put in a sell order. Perhaps a simple MACD cross and/or RSI overbought signal can help pinpoint superior buy and sell points.
03/18/2021,stocks,"I use Python quite a bit, if you were able to record yourself doing the copy/pasting I could take a look and let you know if I think I could automate it."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Sorry for all the questions, you are just buying the stock or are you buying options? Can you tell I'm new to this? I'm afraid of options."
03/18/2021,stocks,"What’s most interesting about this is that the ATH doesn’t seem to fall to the Gambler’s Fallacy, but actually increases sentiment. 
How many of these are penny stocks?
(I *still* can’t get into the doc)"
03/18/2021,stocks,"You're describing typical CC strategy, yes. It's a good strategy, I make about 2% monthly on about 5 positions selling CCs with a target delta of \~0.125. In a consistent year I could turn 25% on those in just premiums. Those are conservative numbers because I DON'T want them called away, but it's in my Roth so I'm not concerned about long term vs. short term taxes.

I get that you're saying this is an opportunity to sell more aggressively priced CCs because he wants to sell the underlying. However, you're missing the fundamental drawback of selling the call - you can no longer sell the shares without first closing the call position.

TL;DR - OP said ""I sell in 5 days if limit sell doesn't trigger"". YOU said ""you could sell calls if you want to hold it for 6 months..."""
03/18/2021,stocks,I responded
03/18/2021,stocks,"I don't mind the questions! Right now I'm just buying shares. Options are fun, but shares give you safety when you're testing out a strategy.

Plus, if you can get 10% - 15% a week off shares that's amazing, and you can lose it all with 1 bad option expiring worthless. At least with shares you can bag hold or sell at a slight loss"

03/18/2021,stocks,"Fully agree with you. I have had a new and bad cough for almost a year (but not covid-related) and all I get are Telehealth appointments that resolve nothing. No one looked inside my nose, my throat, no one listened to my lungs, no one did spirometry. My GP said I need to be seen by a specialist at this point (even though I only saw my GP online), and the specialist's office called me to say they only do virtual appointments as well (and I'm even vaccinated!). My job pays 2,000 dollars a month for this insurance. CAN I SEE AN ACTUAL DOCTOR IN PERSON after 10 months of this? WILL I EVER be able to see a doctor in the future, or are we just going to have 90 percent tele""health"" from now on?

03/18/2021,stocks,Nope I haven't
03/18/2021,stocks,"Because you have insurance with low co-pays. Look at what high deductible plans would cost you to get a refill or have a persistent rash looked at. 

It's a means of reducing overall cost and increasing convenience. Yes, there will be growing pains. The upside however is ridiculous."
03/18/2021,stocks,"yeah i like the product, but don't like the price. what are you defining as ""quants""? i feel like that's a loaded word."
03/18/2021,stocks,"No, that is a high deductible plan.  The doctor gets paid $31.25 for the visit.

Adding price transparency to medicine (such as making that $31.25 available to a cash pay patient), and reserving insurance for protecting against large bills, leaving consumers to pay for routine care out of pocket would do a lot to make healthcare more affordable and accessible.  

The limitations of telemedicine, added to the fact that it really isn't saving much if any money, mean it is not a panacea."
03/18/2021,stocks,"We will have to agree to disagree. Hopefully you stay open minded and follow as the industry evolves. 

Telemedicine and in person services aren't mutually exclusive. My wife works as a NP for Oscar and it's opened my eyes to what telemedicine can become and how integrated it can be for both sides to save money, increase convenience and use data to help with preventative/maintenance care. 

Teledoc is the leader in this industry being pure play virtual services while Oscar implements insurance with in house telemedicine. One Medical is another hybrid approach. TAM is at most 1% tapped, meaning a lot of room for growth."

03/18/2021,stocks,"Because of big money, while 3% isn't life changing to most of us, for a fund with hundreds of millions,  they will take guaranteed money over speculation any day any time.

03/18/2021,stocks,"And for those of you who don’t know, as yields rise, prices in bonds drop (i.e., they’re inversely related endogenous). But we have a lot of wealth growth with some individuals, rate of return is constantly changing, risk, liquidity, inflation, etc. (i.e., exogenous). So I believe many firms are liquidating and hedging via bonds. The bond markets are much bigger than most of us realize. By doing this, they’re betting that they can get these bonds at a decent price and sell them for a better price later. This will be beneficial if the inflation rate increases more and longer than we think because whoever holds/bought the bonds (lenders), lose during inflationary times while the buyers (borrowers), gain during this time because they’re borrowed money is worth more than their actual money."

03/18/2021,stocks,I think people do mention that. It's unclear what the future holds but the concerns still exist at least in part due to the reasons I listed above. I think most people would argue that rates can't stay this low forever so if the trend has been decline for this long it doesn't necessarily mean that will continue.

03/18/2021,stocks,"They don’t give you the car.

You borrow interest free money, allowing you the buyer to use your savings to do what you please.
This frees up your “capital” to invest in additional items to increase your overall net worth if used correctly.

The OP was asking about the importance of 10y bonds. Many business use borrowed money to operate. The lower interest is, the better their books are. Higher interest means they are making less profit than they could be."

So why donyou assume the market hasn't priced this in? Weed stocks have a bsd reputation for good reason, lots of stoner hype based on speculation and several hard crashes when those hopes fail to materialize. I'd say the current prices already have *priced in* a legalized weed despite it being a while away and despite intial competition meaning low profits until a handful of companiws dominate. Sure, ETF is the way to go but Id never have more then at most 10% accolation in oke industry. It's like begging to lose money the minute some less then stellar news hit.."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Let's see:

>550 mortgage 301 condo fee 114 insurance 100 electric bill 79 internet 100 gas 200 food (-500 roommate)

That is about $1500 / month and at 6 months, you'd need $10K.  That $10K should also be part of your overall portfolio so don't discount it, but don't invest it into something that is illiquid.  

* $10K - Emergency Fund for 6 months
* $8.5K - Cash
* $7.5 - Brokerage

Using just the last two items, you're heavy into cash and you could definitely stand a bit more risk due to your ability to tap an emergency fund (something most people can't, so you're doing better than most people there!).  In total, that's $26K.

Consider increasing your brokerage account to $20-22K, knowing it takes 3-5 days to transfer from there into something like WFB if you need it, the cash you can keep in a checking account if you want earning 0%...  

Increase your equities exposure to at least $10K (another $2.5K) and based upon your cash position, I'd take it to $15K.  At that point you'd have $7.5K in equities such as your VTI/VUG (so buy) and can look at other equities which float your boat ... but up to a 10% total position in any one company (giving you 3-5 such positions) to protect yourself with diversification.

Presuming no large outstanding debt (condo mortgage doesn't count as it's a non-recourse loan)... pay off any other items such as credit cards, overdue library books and those car payments if the interest is anything over 3-5% (inflation).

Understand that there are other sources of emergency funding as well.  You can borrow against your credit cards (dischargable) and even your 401K (knowing that you're paying yourself back at that low 3% or so interest rate ... which most means lost opportunity and not lost money).  So you're not going to be on the street.

* You're doing very well
* You're cash heavy
* ETFs such as VTI and VUG will be the core of your portfolio (or at least should)
* Being risk averse can reduce your downside, but will also your upside opportunity

There aren't many places to invest and gather a return these days besides the market.  We can't count on the future holding DJI breaking records in the future, but holding cash means losing buying power today."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I'm guessing that:
A) he doesn't realize how much he invests compared to an average consumer (which is a good thing, kudos to him), and
B) he didn't notice the part about you having a pension for $60k/year (that wasn't in the post, just a comment I saw above). 

With a pension matching your current salary, any investing is just gravy on top, and maxing your Roth is a good start. If you didn't have the pension, however, I'd be concerned with only investing $6k (+ whatever you are investing in ETFs). For example, I don't have a pension or anything, so I max out my 401k each year hoping it will be enough. 

I think he wasn't trying to flex or knock you, though, just legit surprised by how much he invests relative to his salary. I'll be honest, I don't know anyone making under $30k that invests in the stock market; all of their disposable income goes to living expenses or splurges instead."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yep, no debt other than mortgage. I don't live in a condo, that was another guy, but your payment guess is basically my mortgage and taxes and insurance so well done!

I just ordered the boglehead book. So VTI and VUG is fine to keep, but swap out the CNBS for something not so wsb memeing. 

I've always read that you should have 3-5 funds. I just really want to make my money do something. Having the cash feels good (safe wise...if roof goes who cares, plumbing shot, meh ez fix). But I know it's losing not being invested."

I called back and they confirmed the issue and sent me to another guy. Now I’m on hold. by the end of waiting on hold for three hours the guy said he had no idea why they called me and there was no compliance issue.

I do not recommend using fidelity. At all.

BDSI: Riskier play of the bunch. Small cap health care with insane growth planned for this year and the next. if one of the 3 will double, its this one. From reading articles on it, yes there is a catch: an ongoing litigation.


NESR: The forward PE for this one is only 8, lots of planned growth, and sounds oversold to me.


TKC: Another crazy value/growth play, but the catch is the very low momentum combined with the risk of investing in turkey. The company itself would be a no brainer if US based."

next 5 years over 20% and debt ratio under 1. I also try to find ones which got recently oversold, but may be on an upward trend.

03/18/2021,stocks,"Here is how Fidelity explains it: https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/trading/avoiding-cash-trading-violations

Bottom line is it takes 3 business days to settle the trade all the way through. You’re always able to see your settled cash balance when checking your overall account balance. You will also see cash available for trading, which includes settled cash plus a credit for shares you recently sold but for which your brokerage has not yet received the funds. 

Anything you buy with settled cash you can sell whenever - even 30 seconds after you buy it. This is because you bought it with YOUR money. However, once you sell, you’re back on credit until the trade settles.

Anything you buy with cash credit (i.e. unsettled funds) cannot be sold until the transaction that generated the credit has cleared. If you buy with cash credit, which is NOT YET YOUR MONEY, the warning you saw should inform you of this. If you try to sell too soon, you should also get a warning that the sale will trigger a violation. It’s up to you, though, to decide whether to cancel the trade. 

With Fidelity, if you incur 3 violations in 12 months, they basically withhold unsettled funds from your cash available to trade, which means if you sell $10,000 worth of stock, that $10,000 is unavailable to use for subsequent purchases for 3 business days. The restrictions last 90 days, but they will be monitoring and restrict you again if necessary.

You can get around this and pattern day trading restrictions with a margin account, but that is definitely not for everyone. It’s also worth pointing out that the recent Robinhood fiasco was partially due to the arcane number of days it takes to settle trades in the 21st century, which increases risk for all parties in the transaction. Part of what legislators, regulators and industry leaders want to do is reduce or eliminate this window, which would relieve or render this whole issue moot. I’d say most new traders and investors have no idea they are using borrowed funds to trade in these situations. It’s not the broker’s fault or the investor’s fault or really even the clearinghouse’s fault. It’s just how the plumbing works."

A big thing you need to look at is: how many recent NEW YOLO's are there on GME? How many new players buying in? Very hard to tell.

Both sides have their own DD, and both sides have their own uncertainty.

Would this be something I could find in the statement area? I'm searching and don't even know what I'm looking for. A negative number somewhere? Most of my most recent purchases are stocks that are more volatile in nature, should I just move more cash over for a couple days? I sold a couple shares 2 days ago and don't want a violation if one of my volatile stocks blows up and I wanna sell them 😅 thank you again!"

03/18/2021,stocks,"They’re not lying, they just don’t know what they’re talking about. So many “DD”s I’ve read that were done by people who clearly had zero experience and made subtle but bad mistakes in their analysis. Also, almost all accusations made right now are unfalsifiable and not backed by any evidence. That’s just trash talking points. No reason to believe that. I’ll start listening when I see some real evidence and not conjecture 

To answer your second question, yes absolutely, remember, during the peak of GME mania volume was around 160M shares, in a day. The short interest was much less than that, they could’ve covered twice over in a day. So yea off course they covered, everyone did, all the reports says they do. Here’s something you don’t hear mentioned often, short squeeze needs lows volume to happen. That clearly wasn’t the case."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Yeah, crazy normal stuff tho lol. What reason is there to think our shares are fake? 

 Idk, it's just in general what I read on wsb or stuff, some of it is like how some people believe in ancient aliens helping with the pyramids bc it's more believable than simply thousands of people spending their entire lives building something. And somehow, it's perfectly normal to have Einstein, davinci, all these scientists making computers and getting us to the moon, but the idea they had Einsteins in ancient history is unfathomable and aliens had to have helped. Like yeah I'm sure some gme action seems suspicious, but it's been explained. Some just don't believe it. 

I get you're just putting out ideas tho."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Here is the same type of information for them: https://www.chase.com/personal/investments/learning-and-insights/article/How-to-avoid-cash-trading-violations

It does not say anything about where to find the balance details, so I don’t know. Maybe someone else uses them and could chime in. On Fidelity, when I click on the balance tab for each account, I see a breakdown of total cash, cash available to trade and settled funds. I assume all brokerages show this because it’s critical to decision making.

It sounds to me like if you think you might want to sell something quickly, you should just wait several days after raising funds elsewhere, or deposit additional funds, to ensure you are making the purchase with settled cash and are therefore free to sell whenever. The lack of any warning upon trade preview should mean you are clear in this regard.

As to why you expect to trade certain shares so frequently, that’s beyond the scope of your question, but I would encourage you to tread carefully there. Day trading on purpose can be quite dangerous, but day trading on accident can be even worse. I have found that trading too often increases my chances of being on the wrong side of a trade and/or getting the timing wrong, even if the ideas were good. Your mileage may vary, but probably not."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I ran across this yesterday- it occurs (at least it did for me) if you recently sold a stock in the last couple of days, so most or all the value in your account is from that sold stock. If you then buy a new stock and sell it again quickly, you’re basically working with borrowed funds since Chase hasn’t collected the money from your original stock sale yet. So you can buy the new stock without a problem, but don’t sell it again in the next few days or THEN you will have a problem (cash trading violation). I don’t know why this is, but I bought my second stock and am holding it and it seems fine."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Son of a bitch, I’m in."
03/18/2021,stocks,"You might not be paying attention friend. Funko beat earnings by 130% you read that right. Now, guess who their largest retailer is? Amazon is closing the gap. But GME takes the cake. Mix that with a new console cycle in Q4, snd booming Nintendo Switch sales and now you’re really cooking.

Not a single bit of that even begins to speak to Cohen’s transformation of the company. Gaming lounges, same day delivery, etc.

I obviously have a position in GME. But my daily keep is in the advertising world. This is a very rare, and unprecedented situation of massive brand recognition and re-lift, if you will, essentially for free.

Chewy is not currently profiting due to large marketing investments (Cohen has tons of interviews on this), but him inheriting GME, he has started with a solid foundation.

The future is unknown, but make no doubts about it, this whole situation has changed their future. Prolonged the inevitable? Maybe. But I believe in people (I have a great boss), and I believe in him. His a new age guy and gaming, like it or not, is just now poking its head into mainstream society. The stigma has changed, some streamers have larger audiences than the Super Bowl, etc."

03/18/2021,stocks,Is there a way that you know of where I could find out if the cash has settled yet or not? Or should I just move more cash to the account for a couple days to cover the cost of the shares I had sold?
03/18/2021,stocks,Someone should go to jail then if that’s true. They’re responsible for the major freeze on their platform before gme hit 500 then crashed. A lot of people got burned.

They then responded, ""This isn't financial advice, you're on your own"". Then I woke up and realized that it doesn't matter whose fault it is, because the market can invest in other companies that can accurately report their own information and not get involved with a company that can't report accurately.

03/18/2021,stocks,"just can't understand Autodesk's valuation. I've pretty much spent a good portion of my engineering career transferring AutoCad drawings to Solidworks. I'm not even sure we still have a license at my current company. We haven't updated an AutoCad drawing in years. It just goes straight to Solidworks. Apparently, they're still growing but it must be other industries I'm not familiar with as I don't know a single engineer that uses them and I couldn't imagine having to use their software to design anything I print. 

Looked into a Stratasys printer recently. It was nice. Too much for what we need tho. The super cheap printers actually work much better for our very low volume prototype and manufacturing needs (went with an Ultimaker).

Overall, I think the 3d printing industry is a game changer for the companies that utilize them but I'm staying away from the 3d printing companies themselves.

Edit: the 3d modeling programs I've seen most used in Aerospace and Medical Device industries are SolidWorks, Catia, and Creo. All are very good programs, but I vastly prefer the ease of use of SolidWorks (Creo is similar but requires a lot of little extra steps which is annoying). The first two are owned by Dassault (DASTY) and Creo is owned by PTC (PTC). Any company older than 15-20 years has so many old legacy AutoCad drawings that they haven't had time or resources to convert and they just continue paying for a license even though they don't use it."

03/18/2021,stocks,"I was under the impression a direct listing is as you described, and an IPO creates more shares. Is that not true?"
03/18/2021,stocks,"The number of shares created is merely a distraction from who really ends up with the controlling interest of the company's ownership.

Stocks split all the time without changing the percentage of ownership.

And IPO cashes out some ownership by transferring it to new subscriptions.  But I suspect there can be quite a bit of change in controlling interests in the run up to an IPO if desired. In the background, there is a lot of thought and effort going into minimizing capital gains taxes on the gains of the owners of the private equity 

I suppose a direct listing doesn't change  ownership structure. It just allows public trading. No capital gains tax impact."

03/18/2021,stocks,Youre right! I was definitely exaggerating a bit hahah but it is a very difficult thing to account for i should say instead
03/18/2021,stocks,"The thing is that we don’t have a pure capitalist society. If we did, there wouldn’t be bailouts like we had last year or even during the banking crisis back in 2007/2008. Those banks/companies would go under, giving the opportunities for smaller/upcoming competitors to rise or even new companies to form and gain some of the marketshare. 

I agree, competition drives innovation, but new comers with likely more innovative products/services or whatever have a more difficult time gaining traction due to the big dogs. Some rightly earn their place at the top, but when they suffer, they should be allowed to collapse under capitalism. 

As for the estate tax, the point I’m making is that the $3mil mark is too low for the exemption for high cost of living areas like parts of California, New York, and other major cities. Having property alone can trigger large amounts of estate tax for the upper middle class (net worth between $3-5mil). Remember, before the last administration, the exemption was around $5.5mil before raising it double when Trump came around. The threshold being lowered to $3mil would cause upper middle class inheritees to liquidate the property they inherit to pay the estate tax, unless they have hundreds of thousand in cash laying around. So basically at the time of transfer, this appreciating asset stops being an asset and is converted into cash, taxed, then needing to be reinvested (hopefully) but now somewhere else that is more affordable to the inheritee. While say, someone who’s inheriting $5mil would need to be 2 properties, maybe they need to liquidate one to pay for the estate taxes (continuing on a $3mil exemption) but they still have one appreciating asset, thus helping bridge the wealth gap. In the first scenario the person doesn’t. Any ground that was previously gained is lost. Keep in mind that when inheriting property, there’s no cash involved, so although there’s value, cash needs to come from somewhere to pay taxes. Without selling the property, the next likely place is going to the banks to pull a mortgage or LOC and now this person has debt attached to the inheritance.  In this case, the banks come out ahead, which isn’t a coincidence either.

I’m in the mindset where the upper middle class is the best bet to bridge the gap between the wealthy. While even the upper middle class is likely pretty far ahead of the lower middle class, there’s an even larger gap between upper middle class and the wealthy. If we keep putting policies to keep the upper middle class down, there is no chance to close the wealth gap over generations. It’s like a ladder missing a couple steps. Some can get past it to get toward the top, but much less than if those steps were there. I believe the upper middle class is also more likely to directly contribute back to society either with their skillset or financial donations compared to the wealthy, unless they’re Bill Gates (the poor dude gets too much hate for actually using his money to try to help). 

Probably didn’t explain my thoughts the best, but hopefully get the idea across."

As far as shorts,  I’m not sure of lots of things but in my mind if VW saw a short percentage creep up to where they don’t want it to be, even if minimal I think they’d make some moves to shake the short sellers out. Obviously I could be entirely wrong as I don’t know enough to clearly see VW but I do like the stock currently."

America probably does have lots of assets to sell off to foreign investors. However, America is fairly protectionist. The UK sold most of its assets (railways, power supplies, water companies etc - thankfully not the NHS yet) which has messed things up for consumers in those areas. Some areas have been re-nationalised besauce private companies messed up so badly putting profit over the service. There is nothing left to sell in the UK.

> America can't allow UBI because business requires workers willing to put up with low wages and poor working condition out of the fear of impoverishment. If people could choose not to work they would.

Sadly I agree with most of this. My main reason for supporting UBI is that it would give some power back to the workers. Not having to stay in a job purely because you have bills to pay would, in theory, improvethings greatly for workers. Companies would have to improve they way workers are treated to retain them or risk mass walkouts. 

 *If people could choose not to work they would* - this is the part I disagree with to an extent. A universal basic income is just that - basic. It wouldn't afford anyone a life of luxury so anyone who wanted a better life would still do so. In a sense this is already in place in the UK - in the UK there are a very small minority of people who have never worked, never will and live their whole lives on social security benefits. Almost everyone is entitled to these benefits or some form of government assistance. The reality is that the vast majority of people who end up receiving this get jobs as soon as they can because the government assistance isn't enough to live much more than the most basic of existences (I expect this may attract some negativity from some Brits. Yes, some people do live very well on benefits somehow but they are in a small minority). 

*The only difference now that I see is that formerly better off demographics are being made redundant. For example, DevOps has been the hot software paradigm for a while now and it is basically making software development a self-running, inefficiency-cutting machine.*
*The so-called professionals worried to death about joining the low-paid working class should try to raise the quality of life for the bottom rung before they drop there*

These are points I wish far more people would take notice of. As I said above the industrial revolution was about automation of manual labour while the current tech revolution is about automation of thought processes. There is almost no person in any position in the workforce that can not be automated. Those who think what they do could never be automated need to know that someone, somewhere in the world either has already done so and is pitching to companies righ now or is working very hard to automate your job and will do so soon. 

Welcome to the brave new world."
03/18/2021,stocks,"I mean I’ve worked in the service industry most of my working life so it hasn’t been that drastic of a change. And I’ve already worked as a bartender for 1.5 years so by this point I’m pretty comfortable with the work.

So for reference where I live you can get a pretty decent one bed apartment for $600/mo but if you’re willing to live with a couple of friends you can rent some gorgeous modern homes for like $400-500/mo split. Gas is cheap ($3/gal for premium at the time of this post), and you can eat out good for $10/head.

I am not sure how much I could make full time at my CURRENT position, because I am still in training. There’s at least two-three months of it since the work is more sophisticated and in depth than a dive bar like I’m accustomed to. Our cocktail servers are making $800-1000/week in tips, and that’s during a pandemic with sales cut in half. So on a good weekend when things are back to normal you could have your rent paid in a day or two.

When I was bartending, weekend nights I was bringing in $250 a night on average. Sometimes up to $350. Weekdays I could see $80-150 a night. Plus with my hourly wage I would make $30-35 a day. 

I don’t really have a nest egg. I’ve got almost $10,000 saved up from unemployment/stimulus. Half of it is in the bank liquid and the other half I got sitting in speculative EV stock that I’m planning to hold for at least six months."

The neo-cons are currently running the Rep party but the party voters have overwhelmingly went MAGA. It's become hard to find Bush Republicans because most converted. Many of us are trying to retire rich so we invest that's why so many of us invest. 

The election fraud is real and so obvious that anyone who looks into it can tell it's fraud. The people who deny it don't bother watching any of the live video or any of the hard evidence. 

If an entire portion of the investment community switches from bullish to bearish maybe the stock market just creeps up slowly. Should any bad news happen then what happens then? The market went from a straight up bull run to this weird bull,bear,bull,bear,bull,bear market. Seems to me the market is trying to figure out what it's doing after having a crazy long bull run."

It’s kind of sad that otherwise smart people are actually gullible enough to believe there was some nationwide massive voter fraud because a literal con man told them to, but that’s an issue for you to grapple with I guess.

Yes, a lot of conservatives are into investing and passive income. What I’m saying is that most investors aren’t desperate or gullible enough to think the election was a hoax, and most of the people dumb enough to believe that stuff aren’t investing. Not a substantially large enough number that it would affect markets, which gets back to my original point about what you said, when you talked about ‘this half’ not being sold into America anymore.

It’s not a half, not even close, so you’re placating yourself when you think like that. It’s a dwindling number, and not nearly impactful enough to impact the markets, because most people surprisingly aren’t that stupid.

If I’m being honest, like I said before I lean conservative but dislike trump. I was hoping trump would lose the presidency and the republicans would win the senate to cause gridlock because I dislike these policies being mentioned in this thread.  I can have an original thought to myself though and believe when my side is wrong.  The 2k was a ploy to win the senate, you don’t have to defend it every politician promises things they don’t intend to keep in order to win.  Just like I believe trump was embarrassing with the way he handled covid, storming the capital was a disgrace, and the things he said many other times made America look awful.

There's no new/growing tech in that though. At best you could call their UX tech, but if they have no shows to watch it doesn't matter, and the UX can be ripped off. You can copy how things look and feel, and you can make an attempt to copy the algorithm  that suggests shows to watch. But with netflix's shrinking library that algorithm is less and less relevant. And nowadays people mostly don't care at all what they watch, or go to a service for one specific show and don't need suggestions.

Taiwan is so not protected by NATO that Congress has to designate it a ""Major non-NATO Ally"" to get the Pentagon to allocate attention to it.

03/18/2021,stocks,I think this run will deflate pretty soon...but I do think there could be catalysts in the year that send the price up again. The idea that intrigues me is the share recall at the July shareholders meeting. Either way we have more power when the price is lower.

03/18/2021,stocks,"Not at all. It would basically eliminate the counterfeit shares. In theory it would force all institutions holding counterfeit shares to rush out and buy more, causing the MOASS. I’m sure someone with a finance background could tell you if this is even possible.

03/18/2021,stocks,"It's insane that this is a hot take. Tesla is the only one of those companies listed where pretty much no one (besides stakeholders) would give a shit if they just disappeared.

Imagine Microsoft, Google or Amazon going under though. It's basically incomprehensible"
03/18/2021,stocks,"Definitely. There is a Microsoft, google, apple product in nearly every home and business in the world. Almost everyone in North America has purchased things through amazon. The whole world uses Facebook every day.

Tesla just isn’t in that league yet.

I’d put Tesla in the same league as AMD or intel, but even that’s a stretch, because pretty much everyone has a laptop or pc."
03/18/2021,stocks,"Growth = risk. Tesla rises high in price, but it can easily die like chrysler and a new EV company takes it's place. So you gotta be active (at least on a 30 year scale).

While forever stocks, look at what some people have posted about finding their grandfather's certificate. 30 years of share price rising, stock splits, etc, hundreds of thousands of dollars of profit. Yet calculate it and it's 8% yearly. Not a lot. But over 30 years, hundreds of thousands.

There's thoughts about what % of your portfolio is forever stocks or funds or etfs, and which is growth/risky stocks. But risky stocks grow the overall size of your portfolio and you shift some of their profits to your forever stocks to reflect that desired %, and then use the original risky investment plus a part of the risky profit to keep ""gambling""."
