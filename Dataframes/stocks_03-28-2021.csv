03/28/2021,stocks,Dividends aren't everything....
03/28/2021,stocks,"Because there are stocks out there that grow your money faster than dividend paying stocks/etfs

Don’t get me wrong, dividend stocks have their place and half my portfolio pays them, but it’s not the end all be all."
03/28/2021,stocks,Technically investors should buy growth stocks with the hope they will one day pay dividends
03/28/2021,stocks,You answered your own question. For the gains.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Most not all dividend paying stock are not in growth mode, so the company does not have other ways to allocate capital, so they return it to shareholders through a dividend. Companies that are re investing into the company usually do not have “extra” cash to pay a dividend. Rarely do you see a high growth company pay a dividend .  You buy non dividend paying stocks hoping that they will grow because the company is in growth mode"
03/28/2021,stocks,"> A common answer is for capital gains by selling their shares when it’s at a higher price but that doesn’t actually answer the question.

Why not?"
03/28/2021,stocks,"If a stock does not currently pay dividends, the owners could vote to make it pay dividends. The money is available to them, but they don't need to withdraw it as long as the stock price acknowledges it."
03/28/2021,stocks,Because every investor that buys in a certain price has the same thinking?
03/28/2021,stocks,"Stocks also have net asset value. When you buy a share you buy a portion of the companies assets. Which immediately makes the stock worth a minimum amount of money dependant on how much stuff the company is sitting on (be that cash, buildings, software, etc). Then as companies grow they gain more of these assets as they invest in themselves"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Pretty simple reason for me. Most of my growth stocks don't pay dividends because I'm expecting/hoping for rapid growth. All of my value stocks pay dividends because I plan to hold them for a long time, and I'll eventually use them for covered calls. Growth stocks can make you a lot of money quickly (and losses), usually more than dividend stocks."

03/28/2021,stocks,Greater fool theory
03/28/2021,stocks,"Because in order for the price to go up higher, other investors have to buy that stock which still raises the question of why those investors would want to buy a stock that doesn’t pay dividends."
03/28/2021,stocks,"It does answer the question. You just don't want to accept it for whatever reason. I could ask you why investors buy a stock with 2% dividend when there's a stock with 6% dividend, or why they choose x stock over y stock when they both provide the same dividend. There are many answers to these questions."
03/28/2021,stocks,"But if I believe that the company will be attractive to other buyers as it continues to invest in its own growth, why not buy that stock that I believe is on the rise?"
03/28/2021,stocks,Attractive to which buyers?
03/28/2021,stocks,Future buyers.
03/28/2021,stocks,What would be their reason for buying?
03/28/2021,stocks,"Suppose you make a taco selling business.  You go from one taco stand to five taco stands.  Then you get investment money to help your company grow.  You can start splitting profits with your investor immediately (dividends) or you can reinvest that money to turn your 5-location taco business into a 100-location taco business.  Both you and your investor see huge potential for growth, so instead of paying out profits, you expand.  Now the investor who owned 50% of a $1M business now owns 50% of a $80M business.  The investor's share is worth more now.  Anyone else who wants to get in on the action now has to invest in a bigger, more valuable company.  Paying dividends takes money away from capital investment (investing in its own growth).  It's just another strategy.

Future investors see the 100-location business expanding to 500 locations.  So they invest.  But they have to pay based on today's valuation, not last year's value."
03/28/2021,stocks,Because the company looks promising and is primed for growth
03/28/2021,stocks,FKnol.  Simply Wall Street. YAHOO finance. Trading View.  ...and there are a multitude of apps and screeners.
03/28/2021,stocks,"If I had one share of apple for every post like this, it wouldn’t matter if it crashed or not.. I’m predicting no crash but a low growth year since last year was so crazy"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Let's not forget the market dropped substantially almost exactly a year ago, which is when I bought up a lot. Now that I've reached long term gains status I've been selling. Can't be the only one. I'm guessing this has a lot to do with the recent dip."
03/28/2021,stocks,No crash I do believe interest rate will be going up in 2021. That will have an effect on markets and slow growth to follow
03/28/2021,stocks,The so called experts have predicted 20 out of the last 2 crashes
03/28/2021,stocks,"S&P is at a new All Time High, three weeks after the last one.  That's not the type of behavior that is predictive of a market crash.   It could happen,  but it would be odd."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Crash in the next 6 months if the 10 year yield manages to resume its trend up. Like 2% by May would be pretty bad, I think.

Anyone else notice that Friday was only green because the 10 year was tame during market hours? It was high early morning and high after hours."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Traditionally, in years in which the market went up over Jan and Feb, it tended to go up over the rest of the year. Therefore, I predict we will do well in Mar-Dec."
03/28/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/28/2021,stocks,According to my crystal ball it’s going to happen on 4/9. Load up on puts.
03/28/2021,stocks,"For me it’s a no, I believe markets will just stay flat for a while, tech sector will bring market down while other sectors will continue to grow and improve."
03/28/2021,stocks,Imagine thinking we are about to crash right before we are about to explode.. we are so close to declaring covid is over
03/28/2021,stocks,"Lol yeah right the markets going to crash one year after its low point because of covid 
Maybe a FAT correction 
but yeah Scare Tactic my boi ! The Stock Market is just beginning its new revitalized state . IMO"
03/28/2021,stocks,It could however I think some growth stocks will crash however value stocks will go on a bull run
03/28/2021,stocks,Where’s the crash with govt pumping money. Look at the last two stimulus pumps.
03/28/2021,stocks,I don’t what you recall the last two months probably tank until Biden is gone
03/28/2021,stocks,"It’s like being a Meteorologist, they can get it wrong all day long and still get paid for a job done. 

It’s gonna rain... worst case I warned you. Best case it doesn’t. 
It’s gonna crash... etc,etc,etc."
03/28/2021,stocks,"That's not quite true, market tops consist of very whippy price action and slowing growth"
03/28/2021,stocks,Fair point
03/28/2021,stocks,"Gonna be find here as was investing in 2008.  Wasn't the March crash pretty bad and given the current volitility, rising rates, and what I am thinking has to be a coming correction still pretty bad?  

BTW I don't mean a correction is immenient but something more along a K recovery.  But...I am new and only thinking in terms of how any type of system must react."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Fair argument, thank you :)"
03/28/2021,stocks,Thanks :)
03/28/2021,stocks,Tank? We have hit ATH a couple of times since Biden was inaugurated
03/28/2021,stocks,"The DJIA is literally at ATH alongside the S&P 500 which is right near its ATH.

Give me a break."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Sure, but a market top (as in the high point prior to a correction or crash) will only be known in hindsight, whereas a ATH, generally has another ATH follow without a large drop. Eventually one of the ATHs will be the top,  and the slowing growth and whippy price action may help you decide which one,  it isn't the typical response and most expansions last greater than eight years making one new ATH after another,  I would stay fully invested. 

Of course,  I'm not a technical trader and couldn't identify whippy prices action if it bit me, so this could be the market top, but I don't get worried until those lines Finviz draws start crossing in the downward direction."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Well these past few weeks have been some of the most insane trading days I have ever seen, were bouncing 1% either direction fairly regularly which is definitely very whippy"
03/28/2021,stocks,"I'm not doubting you,  I don't know how to look at those things other than the lines on Finviz.   I remember a few years ago a bunch of +/- 3% days but then when it was all over, the trend went up.  Does that whippy action happen at bottoms also? Is that what I'm remembering?"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Whippy price action is indicative of increased volatility, so yea whippy price action is indicative of major bottoms and tops not ends of smaller cycles. Also just a question how long have you been trading since you don't need lines to tell volatility normally the market dosnt move anywhere close to 1% on average"
03/28/2021,stocks,"You’re using brokerages, these days every brokerage has an app so it’s not clear at least to me, what you’re looking to switch to"
03/28/2021,stocks,All those places are brokers (brokerages) do you mean a financial advisor like edward jones? Or someone that creates and manages your portfolio. I personally wouldn’t unless you have a big mix of assets and accounts in your life but most places like this will give you a consultation. If you just want managed funds available to most (ie not hedge funds) then you have mutual funds or eft’s main difference is mutual funds have higher fees because they are actively managed meaning if there’s a big market downturn or fluctuations they have some control over mitigation of loss. EFTs are not actively managed so the % in fees is a lot less but during extreme fluctuations they tend to just hold positions. I will tell you though if you’ve only been in the market the past year and bought during the initial pandemic low and then upswing of 150-180% are not uncommon I would at least think about trailing stop losses if you’re just holding on these
03/28/2021,stocks,Waooo 130% is really good
03/28/2021,stocks,"On tv, they usually call their stock broker and it looked important, I thought maybe I needed that lol. Sounds like these apps are essentially the same thing. I’m clueless."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I was under the impression that brokers may give you some kind of guidance, but it sounds like I’m making this more complicated than it has to be. I may just move everything over to a safer company and forget about it. I appreciate your through explanation"
03/28/2021,stocks,I feel like it was rather easy considering the dip last March. I just happened to get started at the right time. I sincerely doubt I’d be able to get that return in a “normal” market.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Volatile and long term don't go well together. Long term stocks are solid well performing profitable, with moat.  These typically aren't Volatile. I have a few stocks that I have faith in as an example,  405 shares of AFL cost basis $39.71, but I don't expect it to rapidly move up or down.   I think it will continue to make a random walk in the upward direction for the next decade while paying me a decent dividend."
03/28/2021,stocks,I think ON will be a real winner this year
03/28/2021,stocks,Honestly. I'm liking REITs right now.
03/28/2021,stocks,"I would be interested in contributing on some projects in the future, if you are open to the idea! (Current grad student cs and engineer)"
03/28/2021,stocks,Palantir Technologies will be phenomenal long term
03/28/2021,stocks,GOOG probably for me. I think the upside is limited in comparison to other stocks. But Google is so embedded in our societal consciousness and infrastructure that it can only continue to grow imo.

03/28/2021,stocks,">Volatile and long term don't go well together.

Agreed, my plan is to purchase a volatile stock (that I have faith in) when it tanks, maybe short it.

&#x200B;

Long term wait for a tank if it comes, then buy the dip and hold.

With that being said, I'll look into these :)"

03/28/2021,stocks,I started reading it yesterday and I'm not sure if I will continue. To me it seems like a lot of the book is about the dotcom bubble and the events around year 2000 and not about investing. Am I wrong there?

03/28/2021,stocks,"VTI for long term and secure. As far as individual stocks, Microsoft, Honeywell, Disney are some of my favorites. I believe Pepsi has the best dividends return. Personally I like a majority of my money in VTI and other ETFs 70%. 10% in blue chips I feel will grow exponentially. 10% for yolo plays. I'd suggest keeping a nice chuck of cash in your portfolio too as you watch the market. Most notably now with the market volatility. I'm fairly new at this but I've done my DD. If anyone has feedback or different opinion, feel free to elaborate.

Edit: 20% in blue chips"
03/28/2021,stocks,"I would say companies like KO and PEP are no brainers for a long term portfolio, if you want a little bit more risk go for some old tobacco stocks like PM, MO or BTI. Railroad companies are also amazing long term investment."

03/28/2021,stocks,"Those stocks are not what I would consider diversified. Being consumer staples, energy, utilities, commodities and real estate would be diversified. If there is a market crash all those sectiors are going way down."
03/28/2021,stocks,Maybe pick a few of your favorites and give them a little more of the pie each time. And maybe whittle away some of your less favored stocks. Lots of diversification means that you take less of a hit if one tanks but really the most you should have should be around 10-12 and that’s on the high end. Also enable DRIP
03/28/2021,stocks,"I'd check out VNQ to get some REIT exposure. The dividends are usually pretty nice from that sector and it looks like one of the best performing ETFs for real estate. I've also got PG sitting at about 8% in my 401k, it's such a steady company"
03/28/2021,stocks,Thanks man i appreciate the input. I think I might need to narrow my portfolio down a bit and not have 100% of it in just long term bluechips aha :)
03/28/2021,stocks,Appreciate it man :)
03/28/2021,stocks,Nothing wrong with having it in a lot of bluechips.  You can almost make your own ETF with enough stocks and not pay the ETF fee.
03/28/2021,stocks,I like the canadian railways (CP and CNR) I think they are better than their American competitors. You might only want to invest in the US and UK though. You can buy these and some other large cap Canadian stocks on the nyse though if you can't buy from the tsx.

03/28/2021,stocks,"I wouldn't.   I think the California high speed train that is way overbudget,  and way behind schedule has killed any hope for passengers rail in the US for any foreseeable future.  

If you insist on betting on rail, go with something like WAB that makes parts.   It's doing well with freight and passenger (if it happens) will still need a lot of those basic parts (wheels,  brakes,  couplers,  etc)."
03/28/2021,stocks,"American companies? That's tough. Wabtec maybe? Bombardier is Canadian but in the S&P I think, Alstom is OTC but send like a decent company."

03/28/2021,stocks,The risk in the rail market is with equipment suppliers. The strong play is with a few consultants and a few large contractors. The former large US signal equipment suppliers are now foreign owned and keep changing hands.
03/28/2021,stocks,"I'd be very thorough about DD for Wabtec.  They sounded fine by me a while back, and disappointed me severely.. up.. decent paper profit, down... Held longer than intended just to break even.  It's more volatile than I'd think is justified.

Know that I trust their business model, but the varieties of heavy rail equipment businesses makes me wary of doing it again. 

Note: they took much of GEs business since I unloaded it. Could be better for them, now."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Awesome! Thanks for the feedback, exactly what I was hoping to find. California high speed rail is a good counter point. I'll have to take a look at WAB which I've seen, but haven't researched yet."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I'd have to double check, but I'm pretty sure bombardier sold off it's rail stuff."
03/28/2021,stocks,The reason I'm asking about US companies is pretty straight forward politics. It's an easier sell politically if the investments go American.

Or is it that you just don’t want any companies to make money on it? So you want it to be organized by the government to ensure that everyone has access to clean drinking water? Can it be a combination of the two? Or should the government be allowed to seize all sources of drinking water? Do you want water to be free, or do you just want price control?

It’s not clear what you are want or are asking for.

EDIT: Why downvote? I seriously don’t see the battle he is talking about?"
03/28/2021,stocks,In my opinion there isn't to much wrong with that. I just don't see how water being traded as a future is much different from soybeans being traded as a future or beef being traded as a  future.

We’re taking about Wall Street here. I’m sure they’ll find a way to affect the supply and demand of water through conflicts of interests nobody will know about."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Lol, because Wallstreet has been known for its morals and ethics? 

It’s an investment opportunity. What’s to say they don’t find ways to ‘create the shortage of water’ themselves. 

They’ll find a way to influence it."

03/28/2021,stocks,"So why haven't wal street created an oil shortage or a beef shortage or lumber shortage. Because it's out of their control, altering the supply of water is nearly impossible as I is for oil and other comodites because wall street deals with finances and they can manipulate financial product but creating a water shortage or any commodity shortage hasn't been done by wall street before so idk why you think they will suddenly manipulate the price of a new commodity when the comodites they have been trading for forever haven't been manipulated, your argument boils down to wall street is evil with no historical evidence to back it up."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Sub-prime crisis. 2008.

Unfortunately for that one, they actually got caught. 

So we have evidence."
03/28/2021,stocks,Companies/governments do create shortages of products. There are agreements for the amount of oil that they release to the market. Milk is washed down the drain when there is too much supply. It happens all the time.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Like I said wall street can easily manipulate financial products because they create them, but water is dicated by so many factors that wall street doesn't control"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Well first wall street doesn't do this, these tightly controlled prices are mainly for the betterment of the economy and to make sure there is not an oversupply, this is not done to speculate on prices and manipulate the markets of these respective comodites for the betterment of themslves like this guy is saying."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Lol because they haven’t gotten caught. I don’t need evidence. 

I work in Finance and you’d be surprised the shit we do to maintain clients on a daily basis. 

We definitely don’t break the rules, but we definitely bend them. 

As far as we can."
03/28/2021,stocks,What?? Like I just said finance companies can manipulate things that have to do with finance. But water is dictated by supply and demand and also dicated by many factors the financial industry can't influence. I know wall street breaks the rules when it comes to financial products but they can't influence something as broad as water or oil even if they tried.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Supply and demanded is dictated by beliefs relating to greed, uncertainty, doubt, FOMO etc. and through psychology. 

Beliefs and psychology can be manipulated."
03/28/2021,stocks,Are you sure you work in finance lol. How exactly can a product that is used by people across the globe for their everyday needs be manipulated by psychology? I'm just very confused at what you are getting at here is wall street going to make the whole world go into a mad dash for water? I'm just very confused mabye you could elaborate
03/28/2021,stocks,"It can be manipulated by psychology when there is a monetary interest to be gained. 

Wall Street doesn’t have to be the main player, they can outsource methods related to their interest to third parties that assume the risk. 

Also, Making water as a tradable commodity puts a basic human right into the hands of financial institutions and investors, a very dangerous arrangement as climate change alters precipitation patterns and increased water scarcity."
03/28/2021,stocks,"But again futures are a financial derivative they don't affect price. Wall Street can play the coming climate change but it won't affect the real price. Also I'm still confused as to what you mean by psychology, do you mean that someone will influence 7b people to suddenly buy water? Because that is definitely very ridiculous. What's diffrent is everyone buying water because of global warming and wall street benifiting off that, yea it might not be moral but it really doesn't affect anyone or water prices."
03/28/2021,stocks,"You seem to think of Wallstreet as just a financial company, I don’t think you seem to understand the connections they have globally. 

Veoila, Surz, Xylem are water companies that will have a conflict of interest when water becomes tradable. 

Your whole stance is founded on the basis that Wallstreet can’t influence supply and demand of commodities. 

You’re thinking from a small fish point of view, with limited knowledge of how things actually work financially and globally.

It seems like you know nothing about Wallstreets operations asides from the basics and being ignorant to everything they are related to and have an impact/influence on. 

This argument warrants no more further responses. I don’t have time to write a wall of posts just to provide my stance. 

Do your own research. Or go take your MBA from a top 20, intern and work for wall street for a decade, become a CFO and then only will you understand how the big boys really play. 

Laws and regulations? Lol. They don’t care about that and never have.

The only time Wall-street ever creates new regulations is when they get caught red handed and then manipulate the public my making ‘stricter’ rules so that they can convince the very people they screwed to trust them with their money again.

So tight regulations? There’s always a way around it, everyone should know this by now. 


Have a good day."
03/28/2021,stocks,You must not know how regulated the water and by extension utility companies are by the government. These companies are regulated more than any other industry for a good reason.
03/28/2021,stocks,You. Want some more?

I have a little invested in a each of the Ark active ETFs and Ark's PRNT.

03/28/2021,stocks,SBE merged with CHPT
03/28/2021,stocks,Chpt any day. Blnk is a horrendous company
03/28/2021,stocks,Chargepoint is probably the best charging station company. I do hope they implement more fast charge (400V) chargers so that Electrify America doesn't encroach on their market share.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Google ‘ev charging station near me’ and see what comes up. When I did, the first 6 were all Chargepoint; so I bought the stock"
03/28/2021,stocks,Chargepoint has taken a big dip but I think long term this should be a solid company.   They have enormous potential and already own huge percentage of charging spots.  Should be back to the premerger prices soon I’d imagine.
03/28/2021,stocks,CLII EVGo I think will be the future. DC fast charging 100% renewable energy source and massive GM / Nissan / BMW tie up.
03/28/2021,stocks,No one mentioned tpgy and it’s sad af cause it’s the best charging play we have in the market right now not only because of the fundamentals but also the valuations. First mover advantage is really important in this market because the competitors aren’t likely be able to compete in the same location if there’s already someone in the location. TPGY is expanding at 3x the speed of chpt and is the clear winner in the charging market right now. Currently it has more than 200k stations and chpt has around 130k and they are expecting to hit 1 mil stations by 2023. It’s mainly in Europe but we should start seeing stations in the states pretty soon.
03/28/2021,stocks,Fastned
03/28/2021,stocks,"From my understanding XL fleet created a branch of their company ""xl grid."" They just got the deal for the world's largest charging station at the new arena in New York.  I think they plan on utilizing arena parking lots Nation wide for charging when the stadiums arent having an event. This would work well if you consider commercial trucks will need this to become prevalent in EV, since they're too big for smaller lot charging."
03/28/2021,stocks,GIK soon to be ZEV
03/28/2021,stocks,The last ticker switched over to CHPT.  That's why you can't find it anymore.
03/28/2021,stocks,GRID etf
03/28/2021,stocks,Thanks 🙏
03/28/2021,stocks,BLNK why so bad? Do you live in US? I am in Europe and the only thing I can see is good rating for that stock
03/28/2021,stocks,Electrify is publicly traded ?
03/28/2021,stocks,I live in EU. For USA what’s the most popular ?
03/28/2021,stocks,Good to know. BLNK no?
03/28/2021,stocks,Is EVgo offered via CLII? What’s the ticket ?
03/28/2021,stocks,Why did the price drop by almost 50% between February and now.
03/28/2021,stocks,Yep. Came here to say the same thing. TPGY/EVBox. Largest in Europe and already started expanding here in the states.
03/28/2021,stocks,It has only 47 employees. I would not invest into that
03/28/2021,stocks,Thanks
03/28/2021,stocks,Is there an UCITS alternative to this ? I live in EU
03/28/2021,stocks,Good question I live in USA there management is horrible and dodgy and most of their chargers are broken
03/28/2021,stocks,"No, but I think they plan on going public within the year. They are also backed by VW group so that is another powerful catalyst for their bull case."
03/28/2021,stocks,ChargePoint is the largest network of chargers in the states.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Blink was definitely overpriced, I can’t believe it’s still higher than Chargepoint since SBE merger went through. Its not a bad play with EV push. I like Chargepoint’s management a lot more than BLNK, they seem to have a much better vision and ability to see their vision through.  I can’t speculate on near term value,  could climb to premerger 40-50s or stay in this value range if EV doesn’t become more established.  But if you want to put money in and never think about it til 2025, Chargepoint should continue to grow and eventually dominate the market in my opinion.  In their presentations they expect some considerable growth in 5 years."
03/28/2021,stocks,CLII is EVGO SPAC
03/28/2021,stocks,"It’s a spac that’s what it comes down to. Most spacs are getting down to nav cause they are deemed to be speculative and usually don’t fare well when it comes to a sell off. Relative to the other spacs out there, it has fared pretty well compare to majority of them I would say."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Sorry, I don’t know."
03/28/2021,stocks,Thanks for the information. So better go with CHPT?
03/28/2021,stocks,Good to know. Any other suggestion that I might be missing? I live in EU and all these companies are in the US
03/28/2021,stocks,Thanks
03/28/2021,stocks,Finally what about CLII EVgo? I know that Chargepoint is their n1 competitor
03/28/2021,stocks,Ok. And does it make a difference if I buy now prior to the merge or after ?
03/28/2021,stocks,Thanks for your reply
03/28/2021,stocks,Thanks
03/28/2021,stocks,Yes and chpt has a much bigger network.
03/28/2021,stocks,I guess investing in Tesla is almost like investing in their huge charging network but its mostly their tech that you'd be investing in. A lot of the US charging companies are done by state electric companies (PSE for Washington State). EVGo will go public via SPAC (Climate Change Crisis Real Impact I Acquisition Corporation) but they have a small network of chargers that never seem to work when I try them. There are a lot more that I am missing but you seem to already know the main players.
03/28/2021,stocks,"I will probably buy them too. They’re a little different in that they own and manage their locations, and have backing from major automakers."
03/28/2021,stocks,👌
03/28/2021,stocks,I hold Tesla but I am looking to invest only into ev charging station companies. Which are the top 3 in your opinion ?
03/28/2021,stocks,Honestly just CHPT and BLNK right now. The rest of the charging networks are mostly regional in the US.
03/28/2021,stocks,EVgo will be available though CLII?
03/28/2021,stocks,HFS and Goldman had to drop blocks of shares to get some $$$. That’s what I hear as to why their share price tanked. That and Discovery

03/28/2021,stocks,"I live in Mosxow and invest in Russian stocks and bonds. I’m not Russian by Nationality ( Indian student in Russia ). You just have to show proof that you are staying in Russia for about 6 months I guess and you can open an investment account with alpha bank. 

But, if you don’t stay in the country for more than 180days a year , you have to pay 30% as tax. If you stay for 180 days or more you pay 13%. 

Yes, the bonds do provide 7% and some corporate bonds provide 8-9%. It’s quite safe but in case of inflation the coupon payments from the bonds are worthless. Since they are not inflation adjusted bonds.

03/28/2021,stocks,What a great man! Thanks for sharing his story.
03/28/2021,stocks,Yeah hopefully he didn't donate to one of the 99% of the charities that apply 5% of donations to their actual cause. Imagine how much of his money went toward paying some charity CEOs hugely inflated salary so the charity can be considered non profit.

03/28/2021,stocks,But did it actually go to charity or just to the executives who run the “charity”

03/28/2021,stocks,Every time I set aside money and give -- no matter how large or small the amount I can afford at the time -- I always somehow  get something wonderful back in return or lots of somethings. Giving has created abundance in my world.
03/28/2021,stocks,"At least he didn't leave all that money to a dog, cat or bird!"
03/28/2021,stocks,My life goal
03/28/2021,stocks,"hit it me, my name is charity."
03/28/2021,stocks,I bet he didn’t sell his winners which is probably the most common piece of advice given here.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Or when you are retiring just using the stocks gain to purchase things/service that you like, part of how equities help economy in a big way is senior spending from their stock gains from youth. My goal is to purchase lots of advanced sex robots with robust AI dynmics and neuralink gaming gear and its products."
03/28/2021,stocks,The OG Diamond Hands
03/28/2021,stocks,Dude probably forgot his password and couldn’t sell
03/28/2021,stocks,It’s funny because he acknowledged that he didn’t benefit society through his work
03/28/2021,stocks,Sounds kind of like Buffet. Warren doesn't really care about money. It's more like a high score on a video game to him.
03/28/2021,stocks,Pretty sure Charity is having a party time like no other and some $$$ going into some places

03/28/2021,stocks,Did he Hodl too?
03/28/2021,stocks,"Great read. And I share your sentiment. I’m trying to make money to elevate my family, not flash. I hope I make enough that I can give back as well."
03/28/2021,stocks,"As the operator of a non profit, this gives me hope that one day an investing superstar will just mess around and fully fund us."
03/28/2021,stocks,I'm changing my name to Charity!
03/28/2021,stocks,I heard he also had a farm e i e i o
03/28/2021,stocks,"Respect, makes me feel better about my stonk losses."
03/28/2021,stocks,"When I donate my stock market gains - it will have to be when I die too. 

Because this year, while I am alive, I am already paying 50% of those gains to the government."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Im looking forward to giving some $$ back to my high school hockey and football teams, from my stock $$$.

This guy inspires to give back, that's what it's all about."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Did the guy have kids and a wife???? 

I often think about never having a family and being rich I think donating to help the needy is a go to in that situation..."
03/28/2021,stocks,Could have thrown me a million so I could buy high sell low forever!
03/28/2021,stocks,Thank you Jack. One of the few people who should be remembered.
03/28/2021,stocks,this man is a legend
03/28/2021,stocks,I'm going to plant trees instead
03/28/2021,stocks,"Or... get rich, because you now have time freedom, personally going out to help the people who need it on the front lines yourself."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Jack MacDonald was a man 

Who died with loads of cashhhh

A stock stock here 

Some Doge coin there 

Pretty soon 

Pretty soon 

Stacked to the air

Jack Macdonald was a man 

Whomdied w loads of cashhhh ..."
03/28/2021,stocks,Goosebumps!!!
03/28/2021,stocks,I am all for donating but if I was a relative of his I have to admit that I would be bummed that ALL went that way. Especially since there was so much! But what a good guy!! Amazing.
03/28/2021,stocks,Jack Macdonald had a farm. E I E I O. Rip
03/28/2021,stocks,"Too bad it's no easy task to find a charity that operates as a charity to benefit those who need.... charity.

Nice story regardless."
03/28/2021,stocks,"damn. if i had that much money, I would not live frugally.

mansions, cars, hoes, vacations.

I'm single, and don't even have family. No point living like a rich pauper."
03/28/2021,stocks,Donate the lambo to charity
03/28/2021,stocks,"Gotta buy a Subaru like the rest of us. Sorry, man."
03/28/2021,stocks,"yeah i thought the tangent about his Korn obsession was a little unnecessary, but entertaining nonetheless"
03/28/2021,stocks,💀😂
03/28/2021,stocks,Came here to say this. Thanks
03/28/2021,stocks,This should be a book title about him.
03/28/2021,stocks,I too am fascinated by the market - I love reading interesting stories from history that involve stocks
03/28/2021,stocks,"Dad, is that you?"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Don’t round up at restaurants or grocery chains. They donate it on their own behalf and write it off from their bottom line. You should donate directly and be the one to write it off for your own benefits. Not a rich companies.

Edit: clarified below. Don’t round up and make a yearly (larger) donation to a charity you like."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I would never  round up more than 3 cents

&#x200B;

you are a true legend"
03/28/2021,stocks,"My taxes fund government charity. Food stamps, free school, free housing, free medical etc.. costs me plenty a year and I know some people have cash jobs making as much as me that qualify for all of these programs since the government sees them as no income. It makes me sick to think of how many people cheat the system and that makes me skeptical of any additional donations unless I'm finding research for cancer or something."
03/28/2021,stocks,But what did she stripe? Candy canes? Zebras? I need to know
03/28/2021,stocks,Dude don’t dox my sister like that
03/28/2021,stocks,"Ah yes, a fine fish indeed."
03/28/2021,stocks,I'd settle for 10k
03/28/2021,stocks,Don’t see why personally. I see no benefit to me or those who matter to me.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Same, not giving a single cent to charity until I hit 188m"
03/28/2021,stocks,"If I am ever rich, I would hope to instill charitable values in my kids so they do so willingly on their own."
03/28/2021,stocks,As opposed to the model of efficiency that is government.
03/28/2021,stocks,You think donations to charity are more likely to be wasted than tax money to the government?
03/28/2021,stocks,Theres plenty of small law firms that just work things like real estate/renters contracts that are a single lawyer and one or 2 people working the desk and billing who make good money but arnt rolling in it.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Also ""lived frugally"" my ass, he probably lived in a million dollar home and never once had to worry about whether he was going to able afford groceries that week."

03/28/2021,stocks,Ya your right. Moat Charities skim most of the money right into the hands of top executives
03/28/2021,stocks,Some are. Browse [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/) for example.
03/28/2021,stocks,How easy to you suppose running a multi million dollar charity is?
03/28/2021,stocks,"You might be interested in [GiveDirectly](https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly), which basically does exactly that."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Yo mr money bags, wanna pay off some poor guy's student loans?"
03/28/2021,stocks,Lollll right kid
03/28/2021,stocks,"I have trouble believing that, like, at all. Lol"
03/28/2021,stocks,This is not the first time he donated (this happened in 2013). He did this while he was alive and made sure they receive money after his death. The $188m is his profit. He was saving it for the charities. And his family and close friends knew about this.
03/28/2021,stocks,"1. 7-8-year old news.

2. https://www.law.uw.edu/news-events/news/2014/macdonaldbequest


https://www.seattlechildrens.org/about/jack-r-macdonald/

If there were any reversal, at least court proceedings should have started by now. Feel free to share any news of that."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Like the poor old librarian at unh who had been saving up his whole life and donated millions to
The school
When he died. They bought a Jumbotron"
03/28/2021,stocks,"There are a couple charity watchdog websites that rate charities.  Charitywatch, Charitynavigator, even Consumer Reports.

Edited to add... there are other organization / sites that check on charities too, I just listed a couple of the big ones. And there are organizations that have checked on these watchdogs.  If at all interested, I recommend doing a little googling to verify."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I think it’s really inspiring what Mackenzie Scott (Bezo’s ex wife) is doing with her mammoth wealth. By all accounts she is finding good decent projects and literally just handing over a cheque. Organisations who have received money says it comes with no caveats, no wanting to get involved or telling them what they should do with the money, no asking for recognition. Just giving them the money and letting them get on with it."
03/28/2021,stocks,"My parents used to donate to the Red Cross (i think?) or another charity that was supposedly doing work in Africa

Some weird stuff went on and they stopped that because it got pretty fishy. Since then they’ve just been donating directly to our local children’s hospital"
03/28/2021,stocks,"If you don’t have the wherewithal to pick a charity to donate to, I doubt you’d have the ability to pick stocks that make you rich enough for any of this to be a problem"
03/28/2021,stocks,It's not that hard actually. Most charities are legit. Not sure wtf is up with this latest meme that all charities are scams. They have employees and such. Government programs are also similar. Do you think they just hand out buckets of cash with 0 administrative costs?
03/28/2021,stocks,"That's what [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/) is for, and similar organizations."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Look up Effective Altruism, and also givewell.org"
03/28/2021,stocks,Check out Charity Water.  100% of donations go directly to those who need it.  Their operations are funded by a group of people who believe in the organization.
03/28/2021,stocks,"charities are 98% waste, overhead, red tape, embezzlement"
03/28/2021,stocks,Not true jackass.
03/28/2021,stocks,This 100 percent.  99% of charities exist to grift and pocket for themselves.
03/28/2021,stocks,https://www.givewell.org/
03/28/2021,stocks,True
03/28/2021,stocks,Volunteer until you find one that does.
03/28/2021,stocks,Indeed. It's very hard to give away millions or billions for charitable work if you actually want it to have an impact.
03/28/2021,stocks,"It's amazing how little of a $1 donation helps - crazy when you look into how places like Red X, all these military / vet ones. Really sad you almost just have to hand it directly to people on a corner"
03/28/2021,stocks,"might be a better deal to have people apply for money and they can present their case .

such as families whose household income is less than X amount."
03/28/2021,stocks,yup bunch of rich kids are going to get some sweet bonuses
03/28/2021,stocks,It does seem that non-profits are just a place to get poor paying job with no benefits for the workers where the executives  are very well compensated.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Other garden tools as well...

You can't do everything with a hoe"
03/28/2021,stocks,"the man is also a lawyer, he ain't exactly scrapping by on purpose. he just isn't buying a new car every year."
03/28/2021,stocks,Yup same. I always balance building up my nest egg with having a great life while I do it. When you’re busy working it sometimes becomes a challenge to spend money so I make sure everything I buy and every trip I go on is the best money can offer. It’s difficult but I’m hoping not to leave anything at the end.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Brb, donating a Lamborghini to St. Jude's Children's Hospital."
03/28/2021,stocks,"This is reductive. Business who do that are allowing average citizens to make a non-meaningful contribution, pooling tens of thousands of those non-meaningful amounts, to create a meaningful donation. It’s a great thing for society, and you can round up the 4 times a year you eat at Panda Express and still give to charity on your own. It’s a win win for everyone involved."
03/28/2021,stocks,Not sure a write off on $0.11 is worth it
03/28/2021,stocks,"This is wrong, think about if they took the deduction it means they recognize 11 cents of revenue too and nets zero.  The IRS would never allow them to take that deduction."
03/28/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/28/2021,stocks,I just assumed for a charity to get a deal with a huge chain like that the CEOs kids had to be given a six figure no show job at the charity.
03/28/2021,stocks,And then they run add campaigns about how much they donate
03/28/2021,stocks,"People will always game a system. It's much better to just think of those who really do need it, and benefit greatly, who are not gaming it. There much more of the people who need it than the people who game the system."
03/28/2021,stocks,The people gaming welfare systems are a very very small minority.
03/28/2021,stocks,Doxxx
03/28/2021,stocks,What if he dixx your sister?
03/28/2021,stocks,Food on the table is all i need
03/28/2021,stocks,"I'm sure you could find a cause that would benefit you and/or your friends and family. Even if it's just something generic like cancer research

Either way, strangers benefiting from your donation can benefit you in many indirect/unseen ways. Perhaps a stranger you helped one day gets to start a company as a result, and that company takes you to the moon. Maybe a kid who would otherwise become a criminal gets the help they need, instead of going on to rob you or your friends one day. Who knows. Point is, having a happy/healthy society (especially those living closest to you) is a lot better than the alternative"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Do ever have to deal with complete fucking idiots?

Would you like to not have to deal with complete fucking idiots?

Fund a school. 🙏"
03/28/2021,stocks,Any big org is inefficient. Economies of scale still apply.
03/28/2021,stocks,That is definitely twisting what I said
03/28/2021,stocks,"Here, here. Actually, having staff that could work the front desk and handle billing would be quite luxurious. There’s plenty of solos like me who have to do it all themselves and drive a 20 year old beat up car because we’re in a ton of law school debt still. I’m sure this guy wasn’t in debt, but thanks for making the point that being a lawyer doesn’t equal wealthy."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I actually have this dream of becoming wealthy, but doing nothing differently. 

I won’t drive a lambo, I’ll drive a Miata. I’ll still wear shitty target and banana republic outlet clothes from last season. I’ll show up to my shitty job everyday with the rest of the losers. I’ll live in my regular ass neighborhood.  My kids will still eat macaroni & cheese from the box for lunch. 

The real difference will just be the peace of mind that my family and I will never be broke. Sure, I’ll take them on a few more vacations, but who the hell wants another house to deal with? Give me a nice hotel any day. I think I just really enjoy being a normal, everyday person. Expensive things don’t sit well with me, even though my ability to afford them has increased. 

Kind of a dear diary, but your comment made me think."
03/28/2021,stocks,"In Seattle, no less"
03/28/2021,stocks,Frugal relative to his ~200 million in wealth I guess
03/28/2021,stocks,No job is easy. I doubt though that it’s worth 1000 more than the recipients of the charity make.
03/28/2021,stocks,Should have gone to the library. I remember this story and it still angers me
03/28/2021,stocks,This is what keeps me from donating to charity. I want to know that my money's going to actually help someone.
03/28/2021,stocks,"I always thought this story was totally overblown. Fungibility of money means it doesn't really matter that much where you ""designate"" your money to go.  They were probably going to get a new scoreboard within a couple years anyways.  Does it really matter if they spent ""his"" $1m or the ""students"" $1m? It's all just a pile of money in a bank. 

Also, he specifically said give 100k to the library, and the rest however you see fit. He was perfectly fine with however it was spent. He liked the university."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Can’t you leave the money to them under certain conditions? Like it has to go to specific areas of the school, like education and not sports? I feel like this is very possible."
03/28/2021,stocks,Teachers and the admin at schools are very selfish and full of themselves. Typically the selfless ones are not the ones who move up because they ruffle too many feathers.
03/28/2021,stocks,"That’s really nice of her, there’s some good people out there"
03/28/2021,stocks,Most of Jack’s money did go to the Seattle Children’s Research Institute (part of the hospital). I used to work across from the then recently renamed Children’s building in Denny Triangle: The Jack Macdonald Building.
03/28/2021,stocks,"This is an interesting read: [https://money.cnn.com/2013/05/24/pf/donations-charities/index.html#:\~:text=To%20get%20the%20biggest%20bang%20for%20the%20buck%2C,puts%2098%25%20of%20donations%20toward%20feeding%20the%20hungry](https://money.cnn.com/2013/05/24/pf/donations-charities/index.html#:~:text=To%20get%20the%20biggest%20bang%20for%20the%20buck%2C,puts%2098%25%20of%20donations%20toward%20feeding%20the%20hungry).

&#x200B;

TLDR:  ""The Salvation Army typically spends 82% of donations on aid. But during disasters, it draws from its budget so it can direct 100% at relief efforts."" 

I actually thought Red X was much worse but Salvation Army seems to worst bang for buck"
03/28/2021,stocks,"For a long time (maybe still today, I haven't checked in a while) any donating ""to Africa"" is fishy as fuck. Many of the countries there are run differently than we think, money has to grease hands, maybe you don't know the right people, there's regional fighting that doesn't follow national lines all the time.... It gets weird fast if you're not used to it. Best to stay away for the most part."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I’m not going to blanketly say “all charities are 100% above the board”, but I do believe that there’s a bit of a misunderstanding of how they work. There are still boring cost centers, like IT ops, grant writing, outreach, accounting, HR, etc. Getting effective grant writers can be tough, and not that cheap. They’re basically still workplaces, and they need to be good workplaces to get people who will be effective. I’ve rambled on but, basically, there can be high operating costs that seem like waste. (I’m not talking about Susan J Komen fund here, mind you)"
03/28/2021,stocks,It's mostly a way for people to justify their own greed while simultaneously convincing themselves they're morally upstanding.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Maybe a few, but far from the norm. 

>Our data shows that 7 out of 10 charities we've evaluated spend at least 75% of their budget on the programs and services they exist to provide. And 9 out of 10 spend at least 65%.

https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=48

Further, depending on the type of charity, some are easy to be efficient, and some are hard to be efficient. It's easy to be efficient with a food bank, as there's not much overhead, and you don't have to spend as much soliciting donations."
03/28/2021,stocks,I think you've been donating and volunteering for the wrong nonprofits.
03/28/2021,stocks,"I believe a charity should have the goal of putting itself out of business, so to speak.

Charity to remove landmines?  Once you’ve removed the landmines in an area, you leave.

A charity to help feed kids?  Look at the root causes of that malnutrition and work to fix that (while feeding the kids).  Then *leave* the area once it’s been fixed.  

Charities often do wonderful things, but they also often perpetuate the need for charities."
03/28/2021,stocks,Maybe buy some roosters if you're into that.
03/28/2021,stocks,The good ones you can
03/28/2021,stocks,But you should try first
03/28/2021,stocks,I’d buy hoes for my hoes!
03/28/2021,stocks,">hoping not to leave anything at the end

&#x200B;

same here.

I'm spending every last cent before I die. Stimulating the economy in the process.

maybe I'll have like $100k left over to donate."
03/28/2021,stocks,I’m not saying that. I’m saying don’t round up anywhere ever. Then make a donation for $100 or however much you’d like to the charity of your choice.
03/28/2021,stocks,Add a million of those up and it becomes worth it.
03/28/2021,stocks,And * customers per day * days open a year = worth it.
03/28/2021,stocks,Even if it’s not the case it’s your money they’re writing off as donations or donating on your behalf. Wouldn’t you rather be the one writing it off? I guess you can try to save all the receipts or estimate how much you’ve given?
03/28/2021,stocks,They are not writing off just your 11cents they are putting yours and the tens of thousands of 11cents they get from all the customers giving them a huge tax break for the donation that they contributed nothing to. You can keep your 11 cents save each one of them up and at the end of the year donate what it accumulated to at a charity of your choice and take the tax write off yourself
03/28/2021,stocks,"They just write it off, Jerry!"
03/28/2021,stocks,"You can get a tax credit for donations. 

Essentially, you help them pay less taxes."
03/28/2021,stocks,Sending thots and prayers
03/28/2021,stocks,That’s hopeful but the benefit is too indirect. I’d rather just live well and keep the wealth within the family.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Socialist country, my insane taxes pay for that."
03/28/2021,stocks,"In that case, are there any orgs bigger than government?"
03/28/2021,stocks,Cheaper inefficiency?
03/28/2021,stocks,"Aye, this is my dream as well."
03/28/2021,stocks,"To be fair, a million dollar home in Seattle is a $150,000 home in Memphis."
03/28/2021,stocks,"To wealthy people, living frugally means having only one vacation home, only three Mercedes, and a mansion with only 15 bedrooms and 5 baths."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Being an executive of a very large organization is a job that you want someone who's qualified for, which kind of requires a competitive compensation. 200k isn't even close to the top end of that scale, there are some that make 2M (which I'm not saying is a good thing, they're awful) but when you're handling an organization that large, I'd like to know it's in good hands. To do that you offer enough that someone worth it will be interested."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Read it way back when but went over it again...  When we asked a university representative if the bequest will result in anything being named for Morin, Erika Mantz, the school's director of media relations, noted that ""a bench in the courtyard outside the library was inscribed with his name.""

Ain't that some bs. 4m donated but only 100k goes to the library and you get your name inscribed in a bench."
03/28/2021,stocks,Best way is to do the charity yourself in some way.
03/28/2021,stocks,You can always give to your local food pantry. It goes directly into the mouths of those in need and cans of corn aren't easy to embezzle.  :P
03/28/2021,stocks,[Givewell.org](www.givewell.org)
03/28/2021,stocks,"Check charity navigator every time.  If they aren’t reviewed ask the charity for %admin costs, %to programs, with documentation.  If they can’t provide it, or if the money is mostly going to salaries, don’t donate to them.

If they are local, go volunteer with them and find out how they work.  Learn where their pain points are, and donate specifically to that.  If it’s anything significant, put in writing exactly where the money is to go.  If it’s actually significant, hire a lawyer ahead of time to make sure it is handled properly.  Money doesn’t get paid until it can be shown that the project was done/is being done right."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I never give money for that exact reason. Specific Items however, are great."
03/28/2021,stocks,"It's worth taking a bit of time researching charities.  Let's say you spend 40 hours per week working, which equates to about 2000 hours per year.  I imagine you can take 1 hour in a year to look into charities, and that may be enough to help you decide.

Personally, I'm a big fan of the Access Fund, which secures public land access to outdoor recreation areas in the US and helps keep federal lands available to the public (instead of being sold to foreign mining companies, for example).  The importance of the Access Fund to me is obviously reflective of my own priorities and beliefs, but I'm certain that you can find an organization that performs charitable acts in a way that you can support.  Not every charity is scummy like Susan G. Komen."
03/28/2021,stocks,Give to givewell or charities on their list. They are bang for the buck charities
03/28/2021,stocks,"Yes, especially with large donations. This dude wanted $x to go to the library and everything else as however the university saw fit, iirc."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Yeah I think her wealth increases faster than she can give it away. She’s also just married her kids science teacher, seems content with living a happy life helping wherever she can."
03/28/2021,stocks,That’s fantastic!
03/28/2021,stocks,"Lol they explained it to me a bit. They were donating X amount a month to an African kid they “adopted”. There was a couple odd things about it in the mail they got over the months, so they were a bit skeptical but still thought they were helping someone somewhere. Then one day they told them that now they were “adopting” a different kid. Oh no same amounts, just now it’s going to be this kid instead of the one you had!

That’s when they were just, okay yeah nope, forget this lol."

03/28/2021,stocks,"Eliminating the root cause is harder than it sounds but most are trying to do. The root cause of malnutrition (within the US) is typically poverty and lack of easy access to grocery stores. Getting rid of it isn't a simple problem that can be solved in a couple of years. 

Some charities focus on educating parents and training them for higher paying jobs. Some charities focus on eliminating crime in neighborhoods and that would encourage grocery stores to open up nearby. In the meantime, kids still need to be fed so some charities organize transportation to grocery stores or give families the food they need. One organization can't do everything and it's hard to say which is objectively ""better""."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Sounds good in theory. How on earth is a food bank supposed to alleviate homelessness, underemployment, drug addiction, etc, etc. There's other charities and govt programs that spend a lot of resources trying to figure that out. They want to make sure a human doesn't go hungry today. That's a good enough if nobody else is fixing today's problem."

You're going to have put the legwork in to find something local in your area that fits what you want. If you want to make a difference, you have to find something that matches your philosophy and that does take effort/time.

As far as travel goes, though, I anticipate that recovery for major airlines might take longer than people realize.

If they ever finish it, cyber truck looks like garbage, so I doubt they will hit sale forecasts. Downside, China may really hurt teslas numbers b/c they may start banning it in more places so the people are forced to buy Chinese made ev's. I'm not worried about all the ev SPACs b/c they won't be able to get their production costs down before Ford, gm, etc start cranking out ev's like its candy, another concern b/c they have a loyal fan base. I'm debating buying tesla between $500 - $430 if it gets there & a long call option on Ford. Industrials, commodities, banks are a good w/ rising rates & inflation while tech lags.

If you want a buy & hold stock just buy best of  breed stocks at good price points during pull backs and you will do good. If the pull back in the stock is b/c of bad fundamentals w/ a bad CEO stay away. Also, pay attention to market conditions. If rates go up banks, industrial, etc go up & tech goes down b/c it costs more to borrow money for development. If home purchases are up, home builder stocks go up. Good employment numbers = higher rates. Follow tsa checkpoint numbers if your in aerospace. Also, stocks/ companies have seasons that they uptick in b/c of demand for their product.

This version of Atari started in 2013, yes after bankruptcy- payed off all the debt, and is now on the start of a global comeback like never seen before.

03/28/2021,stocks,"Hang in there. I know it’s rough seeing your investments go down for so long, but I want to congratulate you on sticking to it for this long, you definitely got the right idea.

I took a look at IPSA, and although the IPSA haven’t done much in the past 10 years, but it’s up 8 times in the past 26 years, you would actually have done pretty well with a 30 year time horizon. Now I have no idea what is going on with the ECH. It seems to do a really bad job of actually tracking the index. Do you have any idea of why this is?

I don’t know anything about the economics of Chile, so you probably knows better then me if you should be bullish on the Chilean economy.

In any case I think you are doing the right thing by trying to diversify outside of Chile, to the best of your ability. If you can try and find a fund that tracks indexes from other countries, and be aware of fees or hidden costs. The fund (or fintech) could easily be ripping you off.

If you can’t diversify internally you might want to look into bond or other fixed income vehicles. I generally don’t recommend fixed income in the environment, but if you are limited to Chile and don’t think the economy is going anywhere, or they can’t attract international investors, fixed income might be your best option. You can also consider if investing in real estate is an option. You can also do a split between bonds and stocks."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Buying an index fund composed of just Arkk funds, Tesla, and Apple is not diversifying. Your still heavy into the Tech sector. You have options you can either just buy an actual diversified index fund like VOO which is diversified across multiple sectors not just tech. You can also invest in a few high conviction blue chip stocks that are not tech to help diversify but its more risky. Risky in the sense of owning less companies and not the stocks themselves. Or just simply wait it out. You bought into stocks that have been consistently going up for months now we are seeing a rotation out of tech. Tech will always be here and if you really did your research on those stocks and didnt buy them because Reddit told you and you are in it for the long term it doesnt really matter at all really. So just wait it out and diversify more to minimize risk."

It could a country market index or not but the Economy must be growing because the market reflects the value of economic activity.  There has to be a vehicle to invest outside of Chile from Chile.  Find it.  

About your loses.  If you don't want to feel bad in case it comes back then sell half and look for better opportunities.  The definition of insanity is to keep doing the same thing and expect different outcomes.  So, of you have been doing this for a long time and it's down, down, down.

03/28/2021,stocks,"Your first mistake was investing in a Chilean stock index. Your second mistake was investing in U.S. tech stocks *after* they spent the past year shooting straight up to the stratosphere. 

Invest in something with a history of long term success, and steady growth. The S&P 500, for example. VFIAX or VOO. Invest in broad baskets of stocks, not single sectors or countries. There will be volatility but not nearly what you’ll face when you’re invested narrowly."

03/28/2021,stocks,"Well, the market is generally at an all time high now. And likely due for a correction soon. So if you think you’re red now, just way a another month. Hard to predict, this is not financial advice. But the tech stocks you seems to invest in. Are very extended. They will likely perform well in the future. But in the short term they might not. Investing is also about long term horizon. If you’re truly investing you don’t want to watch your stocks everyday. That’s bound to put you in an emotional Rollercoaster. I personally completely missed last march’s correction and a few months later didn’t even notice. But if I was watching my long term investments in March I probably would have had a heart attack chicken out and sold low. Now I don’t know what’s going to happen in the future, and these are turbulent times. Personally I would find some educational material about value investing and look at bill gates, warren buffet, and those similar for how invest in choppy times. Then when things have bottomed out, and the feeling is in the market optimistic, get into ark and high growth stocks. But even so, understand that a fund can do well, but individual investors can still lose money. Why? Because they get scared when it’s not going up all the time, buy high and sell low. If you truly don’t know how to invest just let the funds do the work and come back in 10 years. This is just my general ideas, I’m not a financial advisor."

Let the quarterly earnings come through and the tech sector will prove it's worth....these are good blue chip stocks.

As for the other sectors like growth and speculative plays such as in the ark k fund they will have to improve their quarterly  earnings and EPS to show they can be profitable it will take a more than one year.....I recommend you watch some of the recent videos  of cathie wood where she talks abt growth stocks...and wht to expect....from her funds.

So I say for the above hold and hold dont sell....concentrate on 2 things
Average down if you have spare cash.......and increase your cash holdings too SAVE sit on cash.....remember  cash is an asset too.

As for Chilean funds...if u cant see an improved outlook...you might just have to take a loss...thts part of investing and learning the best Investers lose money it's part of the game....so cut your losses be honest about the future potential  of those investments.

Your luck is not bad this is test of character and every investor goes through these challenges at some.point."
03/28/2021,stocks,"The fund looks like it was trending down for a long time before 5 years ago. Possibly your just in a bad investment. If its possible to invest in some of the funds stocks individually might be better or switch funds. I looked at Bank of Chile (on of its holdings) and outlook looks ok, not impressive but still some upside. I don’t know the Chilean economy though so that could break it. 

If you can’t invest outside of chile (pretty sure you can though) one alternative money maker is land. I know this one personally because my wife bought a piece of land near Antofagasta for 5k about 10 years ago and apparently its worth around 10-15k (CAN) now - quite a gain for a piece of land."

03/28/2021,stocks,"Hey that's a good point! I'll edit the main post with some context on Chile. Sorry for making you read through this wall of text, i'll try to be as concise as possible!

I started investing IPSA in late 2017. Back then (early 2017), the index was looking good because of high expectations in the new president (Sebastian Piñera, a right-winging conservative) economic outlook, people thought Chile would skyrocket thanks to his administration.

2018 came and chilean growth was mediocre at best. People started noticing Piñera's better times (Tiempos Mejores) weren't a reality, as economy-oriented government reforms were hard to implement because of the left-wing politicans in the chamber of deputies blocking them.

It's 2019, the year of the commercial war between the US and China. China was the main economic partner of Chile, so the confrontation was very bad for the chilean economy. Some side effects of the trade war, according to analysts, include lower prices in commodities such as copper. There is a very high, known historical correlation between copper and the Chile IPSA index (you can read about it in [this](https://repositoriodigital.bcentral.cl/xmlui/bitstream/handle/20.500.12580/3612/BCCh-rec-v17n3dic2014p056-085.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) paper, the point being it's been studied). So, low copper prices + trade war = $ECH goes down even more.

October 2019 comes and the 30 peso revolution starts. Public protests were an alien thing for us chileans before October 2019, we had a very stable country with low to none social revolts in our recent history. This revolt started because of a subway (Metro) fare price hike 2 days prior. Protesters destroyed the subway, supermarkets, police stations, and so on and so forth, asking for a refundation and a new constitution that replaces the one written by Pinochet's regime 40 years ago. The IPSA crashes.

Late 2019 comes and politicians from all sectors, left and right, conservatives and liberals, reach an agreement for a new constitution, one to be written by 155 electors chosen by popular vote in the same way as deputies. The IPSA goes up 8% in a single day because everything seems to be going good. The protests mostly stop and Chile finds its new peace. Investors are scared at first because of the potential dangers of a new constituion, but since we have a D'Hondt voting system, right-wing politicans are certain to reach the necessary threshold of representatives to keep the political stability that characterizes Chile as a country, especially when compared to its latin american neighbors. Investors stop fearing so much, and it's this point when i said to myself ""it's finally going to pay off. 2020 is going to be a great year for my portfolio!""

Then 2020 comes and the virus comes. The IPSA crashes to 2008 levels. At this point, it just makes me laugh how unlucky I can be. There is a small-percentage recovery right now from the absolutely low nonsense prices we had in 2020, especially because Chile is the second best country in vaccination speed after Israel, we're expected to reach herd immunity in June 2021 or earlier. Also copper is at all-time high prices, but we lost the copper-to-IPSA correlation after these recent events. 

That's where Chile stands at, 2009 levels right now. In order to recover my losses, the IPSA would need to recover from: a commercial war, a social revolt, the dangers of a new constitution, the coronavirus, and the impact of low copper prices from years prior.

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading!"
03/28/2021,stocks,"I'm so sorry! just realized you said ECH wasn't doing a good job tracking the IPSA. Actually I invest in IPSA, not the ECH, i just say ECH as it's easier to google for foreign people and it's dollar-indexed, so it's a better indication of its purchasing power in USD.

The reason ECH is different from IPSA is because of USDCLP fluctuations (CLP being Chilean Peso). For example, during the 2019 social revolt, USDCLP skyrocketed to all time highs, which means the CLP losses purchasing power and thus the $ECH goes down."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Yeah you have a good point there. I'm waiting a lightning strike from god because of two reasons:

1) The chilean index is at subprime-crisis levels. This is ridiculous when comparing it to almost every other country in the world. I read the news everyday and analysts keep saying it's gonna go up, that it's lagging behind way too much when compared to the world, etc. Also high copper prices and commodity prices in general. Analysts mention the current price has lost its correlation with technical AND fundamental analysis and that it should recover. Actually I read a column from an analyst that talked about your point of ""economic activity"", and what this analyst said was that in order to go back to 2011 levels (55 USD, +48% from where it's at right now!), the economic activity should be as good as it was back then, but it's way, way better so it should just be a ""matter of time"" as global investors realize that Chile is doing good again and invest here. This hasn't happened as of yet... 

2) The typical story of the world's unluckiest investor in the SP500, the ""buy the dip"" narrative, and the typical recommendation of investing books regarding the ""time in the markets beats timing the markets"" perspective.

It seems both of these are just an illusion so you may be right."
03/28/2021,stocks,He literally explained that he didn't know how to do this from his country.
03/28/2021,stocks,"I think this might be a good idea, i won't withdraw my current money (i'd hate selling low) but i won't continue with my 100% saving plan. I have awful luck so i'll just save in the bank, 0% is still green to me."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I wasn't actually buying the dip. The Chile IPSA index has been sinking in a path to $0 for the past 5 years and i've been diligently investing my entire income into that, effectively ""buying the dip"" without actually trying to do so. I do agree with your perspective regarding buying the dip though."
03/28/2021,stocks,"is it really at an all high time now? i keep hearing that but my $ECH portfolio is still very low compared to other indexes whose last year's price graph looks like a rocket to the moon. Actually i read a while ago that $ECH is more than 1,5 standard deviations lower than the world average index price. 

I'm not expecting short-term gains, but in the last 5 years i've been diligently saving my entire income, so my current -17% profits aren't what I would expect after 5 years of waiting. I don't know if my expectations are set too high, but i would've expected -1%, 0% maybe after so much time?

I will wait 10 years and even more, I honestly think the approach you mention is good, way better than being scared every day, especially since stocks tend to go up in the long run. But in my experience, I don't think that's going to make a difference. Look at $ECH for example, it was 56 USD back in 2010 10 years ago, and in 10 year it hasn't done anything but lose much of its value.

My thoughts regarding this then tell me that maybe it's a bad idea to invest in $ECH since the past tells us this 10 years of waiting produces a NEGATIVE profit, so maybe i'll just invest in an option that works better historically in the long run: US tech stocks! That's what I told to myself and 3 days later the fund crashes, hard.

I understand your point, but i did consider most of it already so i'm still lost regarding the steps i should follow. I never get scared, but after 5 years i'm at an awful -17% gains even considering I NEVER sell. What should i do then? Keep waiting and lose more? 

Thanks for your answer."

03/28/2021,stocks,"I'm from a poor background, but most of my friends' parents are rich, mainly because i studied in a private, elitist university. Most of my friends parents invest in real estate and they keep getting richer and richer and housing keeps getting more and more expensive, it's ridiculous. I live in Santiago, Chile, and it would take \~120 months of my entire income to buy a 17m\^2 apartment in the suburbs. That's one of the reason i don't want to move from my parent's house just yet.

I can't find the source right now, but chileans real-estate/stock investing ratio is much, MUCH greater than in other countries, most high income people invest in real estate as it's a secure source of income. Because so many people invest in real estate, apartment towers are sold almost instantly, which makes prices go even higher. And that's also why i dislike real estate so much: it was really difficult for my parents to buy a house, and it won't be fully paid even when they're both dead.

But personal feelings will only make me keep losing money. Maybe i should withdraw all of my losses and use it as a down-payment on a mortgage for an apartment, would you say that's a good idea?"
03/28/2021,stocks,"but i didn't pick any stocks, only indexes"
03/28/2021,stocks,Right.  People are dumb.  Msft and AAPL LRCX hd unp unh etc.  It's not that difficult folks!
03/28/2021,stocks,"Now that's an interesting perspective! To me, investing in the Chile IPSA index looked as the most diversified thing I could do, since it's an index it doesn't depend or on the success of a particular company or economic sector. But as a whole, betting on Latin America is risky, even if it's ""the entire country"" for me, I can understand it being kind of a Casino play for americans.

I'm not scared of high risk plays, I've been reading investment books and guides for a long time even before I started for the first time. I know I should be thinking long run and all, but isn't 5 years enough waiting? Literature usually mentions 3-4 years as a good benchmark tool for measuring long-term oriented investments. For me it's been more than that and I'm 17% down.

The wording in your reply (emphasis on the *timing* part) makes me think that you believe my assets should recover eventually, is that so? I wouldn't mind waiting an extra 2 years to be back at +0%, but the trend seems to be that every time i put all of my month's work into a fund, I lose money. Do you think IPSA/$ECH will eventually recover, being a high risk investment and all? Or will it stay in its trend to $0 and i'd be better of withdrawing the losses and going into something else? I don't want to sell as i would need a 22% gain to recover losses, it just seems so far away at this point.

I insist, i have NO issue with high risk plays, I just find it weird that after 5 years of waiting, i'm so much in the red. The fact that the moment after i invest in tech stocks, they go down HARD makes me laugh, but it doesn't worry me too much. US markets seem to never run out of money for some reason. I'm just baffled by how much i've lost in Chile. I'd be better off not working at all hahaha"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Aey that's pretty interesting. I'm afraid I don't have much more to add.  After your description, it sounds like the worst has passed, so as long as the new constitution is business-friendly I can't see why the Chilean economy shouldn't recover, they might even be discounted right now due to uncertainty. I always love buying into fear, and I might even take a look at the businesses in the Chilean index to see if there is something interesting in there. Copper prices are high right now, it probably won't stay as high when the supply normalizes, but I am bullish on copper long term, so that's a plus."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Which is good, OP is willing to learn from past mistakes. However the poster is right to point out that *these were mistakes*, investing in US stocks can go good as well as crap. OP needs wide index funds to prevent further disaster, that said he can't be the first/only Chilean who's wanted to do this. Surely a quick Google search could've saved him some headache?


And if not I hope he gets help here, he needs to diversify..."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I wasn’t really talking about $ECH. You mentioned you bought some US stocks as well? I can only speak to the American market.

You would know better about $ECH. For example, do you believe your country is on the right path? Do you have confidence (from research) that whatever the $ECH (or any other stock) represents is in companies that will do well in the future? If not it’s sometimes best to accept a small loss now than to wait for potentially a bigger loss in the future."
03/28/2021,stocks,Also -%17 is not that bad. I have invested in stocks that have lost %70. But sometimes. I go lucky. And had some stocks that went %1000 and %3000 up. But those are rare. And they are definitely not indexes or ETF. if you’re doing better than 5-10% your doing well and up to 30% your doing exceptionally well.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Also, yep, sometimes bad luck happens. Investing recently in high tech is stocks and high growth etf did take a hit. Sometimes it’s just the way it is. Unfortunately that’s when people want to buy stocks where they are high, because the thinking is, it might go higher. It’s much harder to buy stocks when they are going down, because then the thinking is, what if they keep going down. But generally you would want to wait for a correction or even a market failure to buy stocks that you believe will recover and grow, so that you buy cheap. This is basically value investing. But there are many more knowledgeable resources online than me. So I suggest looking at what other hedge fund managers are doing as get ideas from them. And sometimes the trend in general isn’t good. If us markets are going to go down, every fund or most of them will also go down.  Some might just go down less than others. Now, if you believe the market is turbulent and dangerous now, I would keep some cash just sitting around and waiting, so that when a correction happens you can get cheaper stocks. For example recently bill gates sold 11 stocks and bough 1. In some high tech companies he sold 100% of the stock or 50% of the stock. That’s probably a hint. Again I’m not a financial advisor don’t take my word at face value. I’m just suggesting that you do more research."
03/28/2021,stocks,Lol did he really? That's sad...how can you play tsla like a sure thing like that? I mean I don't borrow even if I had a crystal ball telling me to buy Amazon in 2006. Unnecessary debts a game for losers.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Hi again, just asked my inlaws because I was curious. They’re Chilean and live in Canada but visit Chile a few times a year and know the economic/politics better. So they were saying there isn’t a reason that you could not invest outside of Chile so I suggest looking at what other brokers might be available and what avenues you could use to invest elsewhere in the world if the outlook for Chile isn’t great."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Very hard to know for sure since I’m in Canada and very different though my wife is Chilean so trying to ask her about the chilean economy - she hates this stuff so not much info there! Anyway, you need to project your investments into the future to know if its a good idea or not. Like if the homes in Santiago are going up on average 10% per year, that would be a decent investment. Do they not have 25-30 year mortgages? Thats common here in Canada. Then can you rent that? Another possibility. I’m just throwing out ideas of what you can do so it is up to you to figure out the math and if that works for you. 

But back to your bad returns. The only way for you to know if your investment is good or bad is to project it into the future some way. Its more than I can explain fully here but learn how to forecast prices which you’ll need to do with many of the funds holdings in order to have confidence in its future or not."
03/28/2021,stocks,"In the grand scheme of things, 5 years isn't really that long. Long-term investments are measured in decades. I don't think you're wrong to take risk while you're young and earning a salary. But you should understand that Latin American stocks (even an index of them) is a relatively high risk investment compared to more developed markets. And similarly, the US technology sector is very high risk compared to a more diversified index. Even the S&P 500 now isn't as diversified as it used to be, since the tech component has become so large. Equities as an entire asset class are very high risk compared to other investments like government bonds, or a savings account like you've already mentioned. What you've experienced isn't extremely unlucky; it's a very common outcome for a risky portfolio of investments over a relatively short horizon of ~5 years."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I edited the main post to include my thoughts and some context on Chile. If that terrible chain of events didn't happen (trade war then social revolt then covid) didn't happen, Chile should've been doing at least as good as its neighbours. Right now the country should be one of the first in the entire world to reach herd immunity due to a fast vaccination program, but who knows, after all of these things happened maybe the country literally explodes. Who knows. 

And yeah, i've stopped investing in Chile i'll try to keep investing in the american market since it always goes up."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Yeah i don't really want to invest in specific stocks because of this. Losing 70% of my portfolio wouldn't even surprise me after all that's happened. I can see your point there, being -17% in the red is not really that bad, but it's been 5 years of not being able to use that money, 5 years of disciplined saving in an indexed fund which is supposed to be safer and it's been nothing but losing money in my personal experience.

So i think i'm doing something wrong. I'm bullish on Chile: fast vaccination, the index is not in a bubble, actually over 1.5 standard deviations lower than other countries according to analysts. So it should keep recovering right? But these terrible events keep happening, one after another. So i dont really know what i should do.

So i take this fintech fund that invests in USA tech mainly and the next day i'm in the red already. And the next month is worse and now it keeps getting worse and worse. It honestly looks as if I single-handedly caused the tech-sector crash because of me investing in it. 

So yeah, i'll just keep waiting for years and years while my portfolio keeps crashing and crashing. Maybe in 20 years i'll be at 0% again? But i keep seeing these success stories of profits in the market... but for me even a 1% profit in 5 years would look AMAZING compared to where i'm at right now."
03/28/2021,stocks,Msft aapl.  Problem solved.  Most people should just buy an index if they don't realize what a good company is
03/28/2021,stocks,"Thanks for helping! I'll try to find a broker that sells international ETFs to try and start buying VTI, a common recommendation in some comments in this thread. I honestly don't know what to say about the outlook for Chile at the moment. Everybody's been saying the worst has already passed for the past 4 years, and every time a new international/local crisis comes and ruins everything.

I'll try to start investing in VTI without selling my IPSA holdings. Let's hope a meteor doesn't destroy Chile or something."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the reply! The decades thing makes me think a little. Maybe I should've done some research on the profitability of the IPSA index before investing. So, long term investments are measured in decades. Which means I should check what 2010 looks like vs 2020 for example. So, 55USD in 2010 versus \~28USD in 2020. That's pretty much a negative 50% gain. So, it's a risky play with no reward.

What a mistake."
03/28/2021,stocks,"But i did invest in an index, is the ipsa index not considered an index? Its literal meaning is ""Selective Stock Price Index"". Is it not because it's not from a developed country? Maybe that's what i've been doing wrong. I've read a bunch of books for people new to investing, so i thought buying an index was the best option for me. What *is* an index then?"
03/28/2021,stocks,Yeah vti will do you well. Its hard for other countries to compete with us and chinese in terms of companies to invest in. Though there are good investments in most countries.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Just invest in VTI or VOO. An index follows an index and has many stocks.

Do some research on Google."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I'll try to find a broker that sells VTI. Thanks for the recommendation.

I know what an index is. The IPSA is an index composed of many high-capitalisation chilean stocks. 

You're telling me the chilean index, IPSA, is not an index, I just wanna know why. If I knew it was considered a stock and not an index, I wouldn't have invested in it, as I do believe I'm unable to realize what a good company is. What makes the distinction?"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Dude this guy is an idiot, don't listen to him. Generally, when people say to invest in an index fund, it's because the index fund will generally do as good or better than trying to pick individual stocks covered by that index. In this case, your mistake was hearing ""You should buy index funds"" instead of the implied ""you should buy index funds instead of trying to pick individual stocks covered by that index"". I bet if you took a look at actively managed mutual funds that mainly holds companies covered by your index, you're probably ahead. 

In the future, this is why you need international diversification, and not just the US. If you can buy VTI and VEU."

03/28/2021,stocks,"Watch futures later today, tonight. Get up early and see how things are going in Asia / Europe / Suez boat thing / COVID. 

Friday and last week were wild and choppy but the last hour or so was incredible. The SPY rose like a godamn phoenix from it's ashes and printed a fantastic candle to close at the highs of the week. It's like once all the fucking selling dried up from hedge fund liquidation a great weight was removed from the markets. Shorts were routed once again. We're spitting distance away from ATH on SPY.

My bias is always to the upside. I think there will be more of the same. Rotation into real companies and more under performance in hype runners. Hopefully VIX stays down, yields and dollar bog and no big dislocations elsewhere so we can print multiple ATH's."

Predominantly, I’m doing more of the same: watching my tech stocks stagnating; playing some wheels; HODLing.  I am also watching the Suez Canal drama to see if there are some short term option plays that might turn a profit. Don’t know a lot about it, so I’ll be watching and trying to do some DD to see if I can’t catch an opportunity there."

03/28/2021,stocks,"Goldman Sachs had a forced liquidation from Archegos.  Most of the stocks that were affected were oversold on Friday and are primed for a short bump on Monday.

If you bought Friday near the bottom, it’s a great opportunity to sell for a quick buck.

If you held through the sell-off, you could keep holding waiting for the demand to come back up and price to recover from a large one-time sell off.  (Likely would minimize losses but not get back to where you were.)

03/28/2021,stocks,"I see 30% corrections to December 2019 levels across the board and slow climb back until August. And this may be a catalyst for margin call on the GME/AMC ETF shorting synthetic share scandal, which I know most people elsewhere are willfully ignoring as a fad or dumb apes, but is an actual major liability for the rest of the market to which we don't know the repercussions yet. I expect a near instantaneous market bounceback as long whales buy up the losing hedgefund's old positions, but it may also erase a trillion dollars or more off the economy that never existed to begin with due to the overleveraging, same as the synthethic CDO fraud in the 2008 mortgage backed securities."
03/28/2021,stocks,Unfortunately it's impossible to find the holdings of said asset management that Goldman Sachs sold shares in behalf of. What I do know is that there were two timings of big selloffs that lasted roughly 25minutes. Just have to spot it and ride the boat.

03/28/2021,stocks,3 months? Try 5 years
03/28/2021,stocks,"sorry, you are obviously not wise enough to get a glimpse. Buffet and the major investment banks are selling off. That alone is enough to send the market into a slump.  They aren't selling off for any other reason other than keeping cash on the sidelines waiting for the impending drastic correction/crash. Shhhhh, it is how they get to be so rich, you should pay more attention...then you can take a look at my balls."

03/28/2021,stocks,"anyone who follows anything blindly is sure to lose. I never said I even invest in the same equities he does. My largest current position is in a speculative space rocket tourism company that doesnt even have a working product  yet. Does that sound like buffet?? WTF is wrong with all of you?? When Buffet says a crash is coming....and then backs it up with action (large cash position) we should all take notice. Then JP morgan Chase follows suit. GME will likely bring down the market further. The virus is ramping up again in the US, the gobe just printed trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars. My position is one of caution. Massive caution. Being in cash is safer than being in stocks when the market takes a turn. Fuuuuck. You guys are full on f'ed up!! I havent even started talking about my cr\*\*to positions yet...."
03/28/2021,stocks,Based on what?
03/28/2021,stocks,Not according to the IRS
03/28/2021,stocks,"Try look at it this way.. You buy stock for $100 and it drops to $80. If you sell, you have lost $20 that you have to get from somewhere else. If you hold stock while at $80 and then it goes up to => $100 then you did not lose anything and possibly have gains depending if it goes above $100. As long as you don't sell when down you will not have actually lost due to you still owning said stock. It is just worth less temporarily. When it goes back you have broke even. However high it goes above when rebounds is profit/tendies. Yes, you are correct in you have technically lost whether sell or not, but if hold you get your money back without having to find it elsewhere. Don't sell, don't lose. Just temporary misplaced. 😜"
03/28/2021,stocks,Its not on the elemental chart!
03/28/2021,stocks,Oh nah this wasn't an earth shattering loss at all. Just another day at the casino
03/28/2021,stocks,Thank you
03/28/2021,stocks,Stoxy App is also really nice for that
03/28/2021,stocks,Come on man. My savings account with 80k in it pays me $1.60 a month. That’s excellent.
03/28/2021,stocks,Emergency fund purposes more or less.
03/28/2021,stocks,That’s at least what they want it to look like on paper.
03/28/2021,stocks,And they still want to charge people 14-28% interest on credit card purchases. Which is only slightly better than payday lenders or pawn shops.
03/28/2021,stocks,"This is due to the central bank setting the benchmark rate to \~0%. Money is cheap, and there's no incentive to save. The Fed is incentivizing you to spend, invest, and take risk to keep the economy afloat."

03/28/2021,stocks,Where should I have my money then? Roth?
03/28/2021,stocks,Brokers can still lend out your stocks to hedge funds to short your stock ...
03/28/2021,stocks,Think 5 years from now.
03/28/2021,stocks,">nothing on the open market.

If it doesn't affect the market, then why is Viacom and Discovery down -50% then? Because they got margin called and forced to sell. not because ""t.v is toast"" Prices don't drop that fast because t.v is toast all of a sudden lol"
03/28/2021,stocks,"There was less debt before, the stocks were less overvalued before."
03/28/2021,stocks,And where was the equity market ten years ago?
03/28/2021,stocks,True... but government debt is also twice of what it was ten years ago. That makes spikes in yields much more concerning (for stocks).
03/28/2021,stocks,The nasdaq sure thinks so
03/28/2021,stocks,"I did, thanks.  The funny thing is the new SEC rules will require delisting if the Chinese companies refuse to open their books to outside auditors.  So the sellers were assuming the companies won't open their books?  Or were afraid of what's in the books?  It's unclear what the motivation was, and no one is talking to the media.  The fund owner Huang has been fined over $400M in the past for hinky stuff.  Most of the story remains untold, it seems."
03/28/2021,stocks,Good news is the gains were so stupid in 2020 I can afford to pull out of speculative shit and sit in cash for while and at least see where this is heading.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Exactly, GME is just a top of iceberg. We'll see, anyway - every crash is an opportunity to buy stocks in sale. The only thing that makes me worry, is the size of this possible (but not impossible, rather more likely) crash and how to hedge against dollar devalvation."

Buying companies with a P/E of 50 never made sense to begin with so enjoy your BB that has a book value for 3$ per share. I'm sure it will provide you with a great lesson. As soon as you use the phrase ""100% certain"" when talking about equities, everyone including Warren buffet thinks you're delusional."
03/28/2021,stocks,">well, we can agree to disagree about GME. As far as inflation goes...you could be right but what comes first, noticeable inflation or a major market correction?

That's essentially how I'm viewing it--it's not that I can time the market perfectly and don't believe anyone can, but when Buffet and the big payers begin taking money off the table, I'm being a bit more selective with my trading.

Smaller positions, some of my money in puts or the VXX, etc."

03/28/2021,stocks,Based on trust me bro
03/28/2021,stocks,"I think based on:

The SLR exemption expiring 

Massive headline inflation number due to the base effect even thought they mean nothing

The economy reopening thanks to everyone being vaccinated

The dumping of the Treasury General account ending soon

All these should result in long term bond yields spiking like crazy causing growth stock which have been carrying the market to pull back like crazy.  But I'm not dumb enough to put a date on it like the OP above."

03/28/2021,stocks,Both had crazy run ups before the drops.  They were way over bought and came crashing back down.
03/28/2021,stocks,Those were sold off because they probably needed money. Due to being Margin called the other huge blocks were from Chinese companies and new SEC laws
03/28/2021,stocks,Because people freaked out on the news more than likely.
03/28/2021,stocks,In a bull market?
03/28/2021,stocks,"I disagree that it's concerning for stocks, maybe certain stocks. It mainly just means people aren't buying bonds so the prices are going down which is raising yields, which makes sense given all the context of our economy right now. Just my opinion."
03/28/2021,stocks,"It's a strong narrative. Personally I find it hard to believe that growth sell off was due to a few points in the yield.

And QQQ isn't even down for the month, but yes yields, everyone run."

03/28/2021,stocks,"Buffet is ALWAYS in cash. He has more cash than ever now...it is for a reason. Again, you are a poor excuse for a person if you cant deduce that my entire response was about how I feel and I am sure and I believe....I firmly believe that the entire market and world for that matter are currently drunk. The markets, real estate, the virus, trade, politics, there is no more up or down. It is all a mess. I feel the world starting to sober up a bit. I don't think we see a recovery the way most envision it. I see a recovery very quickly ended by lack of jobs and major problems with foreclosures and evictions also a huge lack of resources will keep the recovery to a minimum.  I feel that cash is better than equities for the very short term future....because the 7 trillion printed by the US is gonna really hurt. 

AS for BB. for sure it is a risk. It is  very calculated one on my part. BB will likely become the #1 name in EV and security software for the foreseeable future. I bought a ton at 4$ and 8$ and then sold it for 25$ I made life changing money. after I made more life changing money off GME. Im Im currently way down on my SPCE after Chamath sold his shares but not before I made a quick 20K off the ATH. I rebought BB at 13$ and a week or two after earnings I fully expect BB to be back up around 20$.

&#x200B;

Anyway....Im going all in on cash for the foreseeable future. I wish you luck."
03/28/2021,stocks,"well, we can agree to disagree about GME. As far as inflation goes...you could be right but what comes first, noticeable inflation or a major market correction?"

03/28/2021,stocks,Literally

The stocks were all down on Tuesday, big drop on Wednesday, down more on Thursday, and another big drop on Friday but we're expected to believe Friday was the block sales?

This smells like the news wants us to believe that it was a 1 day thing and that everyone should buy the dip.

Reality check, VIAC is actually at the price it should be right now. Look at its historical financials and its historical price chart. There was no reason for it to be at $100.

After a while these headlines and hedge fund movements so common that it's hard to see it as anything but a tactic in and of itself.

The interesting thing is that a lot of people realize this and let it govern their decisions regardless because they think that's what everyone else will do anyway.

I think in the long run, it will greatly benefit the 99% to adopt a habit of holding."

For every seller there is a buyer.

How about this narrative:

03/28/2021,stocks,Sounds like a tactic to trigger further market selloffs and get rid of retail investors.  They are wanting to get rid of the retail investors and take thier money cause despite their efforts to control the market there are sometimes when they cant.

What **did** happen was a major player in the market just unloaded billions of dollars in stocks through sequential block trades, which is highly unusual.

OK, there it is.

No one's saying you have to go to college. It's debatable and that's its own conversation, but listen to what these people are saying about investing in yourself and don't forget to value an income. Investing makes a great ""side-hussle"" but if it's trading you're interested in, that's probably different, I don't really know much about it. Last thing I'll say is that of course this is something that appeals to you. It feels so damn good to make money doing nothing. We would all do it if we could. Is your aspiration to be so detail oriented and up to date on every rumor to have a real edge? How will a gap year earn back the opportunity cost of not pursuing something else for a year? Can you do this AND other things simultaneously?

Best of luck!"

Basically their entire prospectus is oriented around this idea that these technologies will hit an inflection point as they approach mass adoption and their stock values will grow rapidly. When they show their work on this for Tesla, everyone freaks out and says “Hey wait a minute, that’s too much! You can’t do that! They’re just pumping!” Those arguments just don’t hold much water with me. What would be the point in pumping something with a five year forecast? The timeline is too long for the pump to matter, even if the price rises short term it will drop to what people are comfortable with inside of that timeframe. Would damage the funds reputation for no real gain. I think it’s just cynicism run amok. Their TSLA evaluation is just an example of the kind of growth that Ark has always claimed is at the center of their investment strategy. But everyone gets all offended when they predict exactly what they always said they were trying to target. Maybe they’ll be right on Tesla, or maybe they’ll be right on one of their other holdings, that’s why you buy the fund instead of just TSLA. If a few take off the fund as a whole benefits. If Ark is wrong, the risk is distributed amongst their other holdings. 

If you compare five year growth for any major companies that have been successful with new technology, Ark’s evaluation for Tesla looks aggressive but not really obscene. This of course assumes Ark is right about TSLA being much more than just as auto manufacturer. A lot can change in five years."

03/28/2021,stocks,"I made money investing with her until I pulled all of it out in January. 

When I realized how her fund is structured amongst illiquid positions I realized they’re fucked and her recent price target on Tesla was a gross, Bernie madoff level attempt, to save themselves."
03/28/2021,stocks,">yes, they're MMs, not fund managers pumping their own stocks - surely you see the difference?

ARK saying TSLA to $3000 vs  Jefferies upgraded GME from $15 to $175 last week, that's a 1000% price target increase. Jefferies happens to own 1% of GME and is also handling a potential stock sale of $100 million for them.

MMs publish price targets on their holdings and funds publishing theirs. What's the difference?

&#x200B;

>Fund analyst != fund owner/CEO

Off the top of my head I can think of Josh Brown who is CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management and Stephen Weiss who founded and is a managing partner of  Short Hills Capital Partners. Both are regulars on CNBC's Fast Money and talk daily about individual stocks, their holdings and their price predictions. Cathie Wood is in the exact same role as these guys, they are CEO/CIOs and analysts. 

What exactly is the difference between a fund analyst getting on CNBC and saying ""TSLA to $3000 based on our analysis"" vs a CEO/CIO saying ""TSLA to $3000 based on our analysis"". Why would one be a conflict of interest and not the other?

&#x200B;

>You ever heard Warren Buffet putting price targets on coca cola or Ray Dalio talking to the media about the price WMT or Alibaba will hit?

I've heard Dalio talk prices, he recently advocated for the increasing price of gold, which his hedge fund is heavily invested in. His co-CIO Jensen then came out in Feb and said gold could hit $2000. Nothing wrong with them saying that in my opinion, but that could easily be construed as them pimping their position. 

Buffet is different, he doesn't do targets, charts or patterns, he said that in one of his recent BRK letters. However he will freely make commentary on his holdings, he talked about KHC an interview last year saying that they should pay down debt and maintain the present dividend and that they paid too much for the company. Essentially saying that the stock price was too high.

How are all of these commentaries not conflict of interest? Where do you draw the line?"
03/28/2021,stocks,Warren does promote coke a lot. It's a miracle he isn't their Santa Claus yet. I don't see the problem. Burry shits on Tesla 5 times a day and he's in short.
03/28/2021,stocks,"The ""funding secured"" tweet you're using as defence literally has a price target in it!

[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1026872652290379776](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1026872652290379776)

He also tweeted that TSLA stock price was too high which resulted in a 10% drop in price - [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239815256797184](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239815256797184)"
03/28/2021,stocks,"They’re a small company for all that they hold a lot of money, and analysis is central to their entire operation. Saying that the analyst wing of the company should make announcements and not the CEO, is like saying the aquatic part of an orca should swim and not the blowhole.

And they are an investment company not a car company. It makes perfect sense for them to announce price targets for their holdings. More than it would for Musk to announce stock price targets for Tesla. 

To me it seems clear that Ark truly believes in their analysis of Tesla’s potential share price in five years. Whether you agree with them or not seems a better place to stake an argument than saying that a fund shouldn’t be transparent about what they believe the value proposition for one of their holdings is. 

So if you have a problem with the evaluations ark is offering on TSLA, that’s great. That’s your prerogative. I just roll my eyes at the accusations of impropriety or foul play."
03/28/2021,stocks,You wouldn't say that to her face
03/28/2021,stocks,It's too early to judge whether they are bad or not.
03/28/2021,stocks,"No - I meant that Tesla went 7x since her original $3,000 price target before the split - not that she's the reason. So of course she's gonna be even more bullish."
03/28/2021,stocks,"The criticism of venturing outside your core business is beyond silly.
 
Hey Amazon, why are you venturing outside selling books? Hey Coupanf why don't you stick to coupons? Hey Apple stick to making those computers to classrooms, not the phone in everyone's hand in modern year, their tablets, their airpods, their speakers, and forget about that EV rumor."
03/28/2021,stocks,I wasn't comparing Apple to Tesla. I was pointing out that Apple (and many other companies) would be much smaller today if they'd followed OP's advice.
03/28/2021,stocks,"If that Twitter conversation is your justification for criticizing the ark report, you're missing the big picture. Insurance and share dilution are tiny factors compared to certain others."
03/28/2021,stocks,RemindMe! 6 months
03/28/2021,stocks,Go for it

03/28/2021,stocks,How long were you in her funds?
03/28/2021,stocks,I bought ARKK at 150. I sure would.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Yeah, AAPL was profitable and throwing off cash making mac books. AMZN was profitable selling books online before they took over online retail."
03/28/2021,stocks,Fair enough
03/28/2021,stocks,"when you mess up, overlook or lie by omission the little details, what aren’t you saying about the big details?"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Like what, like the fact that tesla doesn't make profits from selling cars? https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/teslas-profits-are-not-from-selling-cars-2021-01-30"

03/28/2021,stocks,About 5 months
03/28/2021,stocks,So you're not looking at this from a neutral perspective
03/28/2021,stocks,"Conversely, a competent criticism would recognize which details actually matter and go after those directly. Zeroing  the insurance revenue barely makes a difference. Focusing on the miniscule details shows a lack of understanding."
03/28/2021,stocks,Classic bear looking in the rearview mirror for a rapid growth stock.
03/28/2021,stocks,So not very long then?
03/28/2021,stocks,"Neutral as can be. I find it stupid to double down in zoom and tsla. Its a good stock, but 3k is absurd. Zoom isnt going to blast off again since we are reopening. So why not make some plays that will be in the green to counter the red?"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Yeah but they completely made shit up about the insurance analysis and you’re trying to defend them basically lying.

Why do you find that acceptable behavior?"
03/28/2021,stocks,"RemindMe! 6 months

That forward mirror tho"
03/28/2021,stocks,TSLA to $125
03/28/2021,stocks,"Bro they’ve been red hot for only a year. 

Are you really gonna give me the poser pac sun treatment cause you were invested with them for like 2 months earlier?"
03/28/2021,stocks,I recognized it was high and don't care because it barely makes a dent if it gets zeroed. People that keep focusing on it either have an agenda or are just incompetent. They can plug in their own insurance revenue assumptions and show what difference it will make to the stock price but they won't do it because people would realize how little It matters.
03/28/2021,stocks,"If you're investing to sell in 6 months, you're doing something wrong there too. Check back in 10 years."
03/28/2021,stocks,Strongest bear case yet
03/28/2021,stocks,The fair price would be ~$400 pre-split so perhaps even lower
03/28/2021,stocks,$75
03/28/2021,stocks,Lol what? All I'm saying is that you haven't been invested with them for very long. What's your deal?
03/28/2021,stocks,"It’s not just high, it’s pretty much impossible given the industry. The fact that you aren’t aware of this makes me think you’re the one pushing an agenda.

If they’re willing to lie about something, that I agree is insignificant to Tesla’s business, what else about their price target is bullshit?

If you’re fine with investing in Tesla that’s ok but after reading that report no rationale investor should be parking their money in an ARK fund."

So your point sucks"
03/28/2021,stocks,I wish those existed so I could sell them to you. Recently sold the max 2 year leap puts for 40% premium. Buying 10 year puts must be one of the dumbest ideas for investments I've ever heard of.
03/28/2021,stocks,You have something up your ass clearly since I wasn't even arguing with you..  I simply wanted to know how long you were invested. Maybe my point sucks... but you suck as a person. Gtfo
03/28/2021,stocks,"It was a joke, no one makes decade puts.

I’ve already made a lot on puts since TSLA $690. Only regret is not hopping in sooner. 6/18 puts are starting to print too.

Sell me some 12-18 month Tesla puts I’ll gladly buy"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Really, then what was the point of asking how long I was in their funds for?"
03/28/2021,stocks,Already sold some mar'23 around current price for strike and at 450. Already made $$ with IV down so good time for you to buy. You can be on the other side of the trade instead of MMs.
03/28/2021,stocks,Curiosity? Dude are you serious?
03/28/2021,stocks,"Then I apologize for the hostility sincerely.

I thought you were making a disingenuous question. I’ve dealt with that from ARK fans before."
03/28/2021,stocks,I suppose I should apologize for being rude back too so sorry about that also
03/28/2021,stocks,"its not timing the market, its time in the market"

03/28/2021,stocks,because timing the market + time in the market > time in the market
03/28/2021,stocks,"i am a big believe in entertainment stocks moving forward. as more and more work from home, family sizes shrink, dual income households continue to rise, and US govt giving out more ""free money"" and multiple forms of welfare, discretionary spending is increasing dramatically -- this includes at home entertainment plays, and all forms of vacation 

\*\*\*although I personally would stay away from the hotel industry - vacations will start to lean more on airBNB and its competitors, and work travel is going to decrease IMO which is what the hotel industry relies on"
03/28/2021,stocks,"More than perhaps any other sector, I think ETFs are certainly the way to go with clean energy. It is an industry that is heavily reliant on government subsidies and other policies. Winners and losers are practically hand-picked. You won't want to gamble on individual companies. Find a low-expense ETF and let the fund manager do the work. 👍"
03/28/2021,stocks,I’m also very bullish on Microsoft’s cloud computing segment. Azure is the company’s golden egg and will provide massive income in the future. Thanks for the analysis.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Number one is tax hike threat. Many stocks are moving in anticipating of what will benefit or hurt due to the tax hike bill. Major reason for nasdaq 100 choppiness since September and the massive rise for infrastructure, clean energy and small to mid caps stock. However now these stocks are starting to go too high. Coupled with some movement from chip shortage, inflation fears, international tensions and mid cap overvaluation, that’s creating some pressure for certain stocks while boosting some. At least for the nasdaq100, if manchin come out negotiating the tax hike down a lot, then both outlook 14000 will be reached easily, still not sure how the other index would look though even if with tax hike being negotiated down."
03/28/2021,stocks,I would add beam and ntla in the genetic sector

03/28/2021,stocks,Energy via battery storage could be a great play going forward...

Look at Nordic American when all the ports closed last year, took a 50% jump because the tankers were charging their clients for down time as they sat anchored at sea."
03/28/2021,stocks,Anyone think this is good for tech? Interested to see if this causes a rotation back towards tech since software doesn't flow through the Suez.

03/28/2021,stocks,"This story doesn't matter at the moment. I would watch Europe for any dislocations and selling. Germany is talking about another lockdown and this shipping disruption could add some selling pressure there. 

Shipping / tankers / oil is up as traffic is being re-routed around Africa. 200 boats are milling around waiting for the canal to get cleared. I haven't seen any stocks or sectors that are getting BTFO because of it yet. Just delays so far and will likely impact Europe / Asia / Middle East more than North America markets.

Second, even if this only last weeks it will cause a ripple effecting many different industries for months. Think about how many containers are being held up at the SUEZ. Literally millions. This means other products will be held up. This kind of reminds me of covid. At first people are like this will just blow over - only 2 weeks. This ship is 200,000 tons and lodged between two continents. It's also grounded not floating. The salvage of this ship is going to be a monumental feat of engineering. You think it's going to take a week to get the equipment out there that they need? Right now they have like a few excavators and tug boats and they haven't even moved it a millimeter yet.

edit: apparently it moved slightly. The ship."

Lol you're 100% wrong, where did you get that lie? 

Only 1.7 of 39 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY (that are transported via the sea) go through the Suez. That's 4% guess numbers aren't your thing huh?

Also that is not even ALL oil, way more is transported via pipeline."

2021-03-28 19:41:36,stocks,"Complete list of this week's trending tickers and top posts from Reddit **How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. I've displayed the most 'popular' tickers on whichever sub-reddit the post may have originated from. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

03/28/2021,stocks,it's always amazing seeing GME top list like this every singe time lmao
03/28/2021,stocks,Bb earnings this Tuesday after market. Discounted sales for 2 for more days 🤞
03/28/2021,stocks,"thanks daddy swaggy

for those wondering, check out [SwaggyStocks](https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/wallstreetbets/ticker-sentiment)"
03/28/2021,stocks,This is beautiful. Thank you.
03/28/2021,stocks,"How is the average hype calculated?

Could you add another column for comment bearish? Bearish and neutral comments are currently grouped together. For e.g. Does UPST have 77% bearish or are there equal bullish/bearish/neutral comments."
03/28/2021,stocks,That Thursday action was sexy AF.
03/28/2021,stocks,"i don't get why people are hyping this shit.

even some youtubers made extensive videos about this shit going to the moon

those bagholders from november must be really desperate to transfer their bags to new holders"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Im anticipating at or below previous earnings.  They’re making more deals but it’ll take a bit for that cash flow to materialize.  That being said, I like the stock."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Because it's last earnings report showed great growth and profitability. 

It's only down because of the overall tech sector and lock-up period ending."
03/28/2021,stocks,I'm a perma bear with an 8 year old account and included bear in the name for that reason. I like CRSR. I like the gaming industry. Now CCL I got mad puts on that lol. pman6 sounds like a boomer. No offense to him but prob doesn't see value in gaming stuff.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Yeah and I get that approach. Gaming stuff can trade funny because it can be seen as unsustainable. I remember the old Activision Blizzard days.


At this point for me CRSR is just amazing value."
2021-03-28 19:40:49,stocks,"Begginer who's looking to buy S&P500 and Nasdaq. Hi everyone.


I don't know much about Finance but i do have some money to invest.


I'm not looking for a 800% yearly return or something silly like that, and i'm looking for a long term investment.


I'd just love my money somewhere else outside the bank.


My main question is, how much of a safe bet putting money in the SP500 and Nasdaq would be.


Thank you very much."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Safe is not the word to use. The nasdaq and SP500 can fall hard just like anything else. If you have some money to deploy into the markets, dollar cost average into the indexes over the course of several months, then hang on for the ride."
03/28/2021,stocks,You should check out the boglehead strategy. Sounds good for you. 👍🏼
03/28/2021,stocks,"You probably want VOO if you want to invest in the S&P500, same as SPY but lower expense ratios.    
https://towardsdatascience.com/spy-vs-voo-is-there-any-difference-437defc2c3f3  

If you're just looking for a place to put your money, 3 fund portfolio is pretty recommended.  https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio  

VTI is an alternative to VOO, total stock market index, though it still tracks pretty closely with VOO/SPY, the small caps don't seem to have much impact in the end, it's still dominated by the S&P500 just because of how large they are in the market. VXF is an extended market index that is basically small/mid size caps minus S&P500.  VT is a world index, but still pretty heavily US weighted (60%). VXUS is world minus US.            

And just to offer an opposing view to S&P500/US-centric investing, US has been on one hell of a bull run, there's a decent amount of people who think there may be more room for growth in international markets and US market may lag a bit. Though you'll find no shortage of people arguing both cases."
03/28/2021,stocks,"better go with the SP500 Nasdaq is pretty richly valued and will probably underperform next decade.

just buy VOO"
03/28/2021,stocks,Voo is one of the only 5 positions in my portfolio to still be in the green after the nasdaq bloodbath. I really like voo.
03/28/2021,stocks,QQQ long term
03/28/2021,stocks,"Future tech is pretty safe. Nio, tsm, quantum scape. You’ll likely have red days though so it depends how you are emotionally. That’s just me. I personally feel like ev,battery,lidar, ai are all safe bets it’s just about know who to pick."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Of course, not looking for a 2 months thing.

A long term."
03/28/2021,stocks,Statistically speaking DCA fails to outperform lump sum investing 2/3 of the time... Just putting it here for a reference for OP
03/28/2021,stocks,"Tech was a future bet in 1999.   And that rosy future was absolutely realized, unfortunately tech was way overpriced in 99 and those prices didn't generally recover for 10-15 years but since then have far surpassed everyone's expectations.  So be careful about being correct but correct at the wrong time.  Do a search on AMZN and MSFT from 99 to now.  If you needed your money in less than 12-14 years and had invested in 99 you would have lost money on what was ultimately a hugely winning investment.  The Nasdaq hit 5000 in early 2000 and then crashed by 80% and did not again hit 5000 until 2015.   Now it is over 13,000.   So a person with a 21 year time horizon did very well, but had to suffer by ""losing"" 80% of their money for 15 years.  Do you have the ability to hold through that kind of roller coaster?"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Long term, it’s hard to beat SPY and QQQ. 75% of my net worth is in these two. It has served me well over 20 years."
03/28/2021,stocks,Lump sum at first then DCA over time. If you got 10k to invest then put it all in rather than 2k here and 2k there. But People generally get paid biweekly and invest portions of thier paychecks. It just makes sense tk DCA because people can't consistently dump larges amounts of money consistently without losing the money they need to live their lives.
03/28/2021,stocks,Interesting. I have never heard this. Thanks for sharing.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Right. I don’t disagree. But those are more dotcom investments. I believe we’re in a new inflection point of the next round of tech that will change our lives. Autonomous tech, ev, renewable energy (already kind of taken off but still room before mass adoption), AR, Robotics, AI, semi conductor chips which is going to be used more than ever in the coming 10-20 years. Those have not been realized yet. Also a lot of those sectors tie in together - when 5G becomes completely standard we’ll see how it drives all these new technologies."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Thank you very much for the help.

What SPY and QQQ stand for?"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Aha, so you believe ""This time it is different?""  Every person that has ever felt that way in the investment world has been very wrong.  Good luck this time."
03/28/2021,stocks,"SPY is the ticker symbol for the S&P500, QQQ is the ticker symbol for the nasdaq 100 (100 largest companies in the nasdaq)."
03/28/2021,stocks,"You can use google finance to compare spy qqq voo vti. I would add more etfs, so you are not completely exposed to US market"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Well yeah they’re life long holds. I’d assume long term investments to be 20-30 years. I whole heartedly believe nio, tsm, quantumscape and black berry will pay off over the next 20-30 years. Less so black berry."
03/28/2021,stocks,Do you think its worth it to add qqq to my etfs? The top 10 holdings look very similar to tech etfs
03/28/2021,stocks,Imagine pushing nio on a thread like this lol
03/28/2021,stocks,QQQ is a tech etf.
03/28/2021,stocks,Didn’t know a thread would change the reality of a company or market. China is the biggest ev market in the world and nio is heavily backed by China. I don’t see them failing. I also think (could be wrong) Tesla’s factory in China may actually benefit Chinese ev companies. Wouldn’t put it past China to steal info/tech from Tesla.
2021-03-28 19:33:31,stocks,"BABA--Looking for a bounce? Been watching the trading range on BABA, to me a bounce back to $250 looks reasonable over next couple weeks after bounce from $220.  Last week was bad for Chinese tech companies, don't think they are going to delist because Wall Street is not going to give up their position to Hong Kong, London or Shanghai willingly.  Just a lot of political BS. Likely bet with options, can get the 4-9 $245 strike for $2.26 for 50% gain."
03/28/2021,stocks,What happens to puts if the stock is delisted?
03/28/2021,stocks,I got 77 baba shares and keep adding with every paycheck. Its my 2nd largest position and hoping to be first
03/28/2021,stocks,"Few concerns for me. Chinese ccp took over BABA. Jack Ma is removed without his will. Bill Gates sold all his BABA position. Not sure if it’s a good call, but who knows."
03/28/2021,stocks,All Chinese stocks to 0 or delist. Can't trust the ccp they all fudge their numbers.
03/28/2021,stocks,45 strike?  You mean 245?
03/28/2021,stocks,Probably act like a short
03/28/2021,stocks,"I think BABA from a discounted cash flow valuation is one of the best value + growth stocks out there. Their cloud business has just become profitable growing at 50%. Even completely ignoring the stake in Ant Financial, this is a buy."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Yeah apparently with the slr rate rising I read that a lot of banks are pulling out of tech/Chinese tech basically speculative stocks.

Which we saw on Friday."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I'm 100% just guessing, but my guess would be that it could still be executed, but it would be on the put buyer to find the shares to sell, no idea on selling the put position itself though."
03/28/2021,stocks,MA hasn’t been CEO during any of the news of his disappearance this past year. Jesus. No one knows how to google anymore?
03/28/2021,stocks,"Valid concerns, but at end of day the CCP wants to support their stars, albeit after taken to woodshed.  Huge growth, fair value, i'm looking for a bounce back trade."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Yea, some say that, no way does wall street let big Chinese stocks delist.  They fight for listings, $ from WS win out over politics."
03/28/2021,stocks,They are audited by PwC
03/28/2021,stocks,"Yes, fat fingered that one"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Just trying to play a bounce back, RSI about 41"
03/28/2021,stocks,"I agree with you, but also when you get into more details that isn't everything.

BABA is certainly at risk for it's association w/ Jack Ma's crew as well as the general crackdown. There was a great WSJ piece in the past month about the complicated ownership structure of Ant Group where a lot of people in Jiang Zemin's faction secretly owned shares through various structures. And that it made Xi mad. It wasn't just the credit risk Ant Group posed that led to him pulling the plug on the IPO.

So, I don't think any of us really have transparency on the details of that imo. It's a risk.

And I bought in when it dropped to the 220's in December so I'm still long. But it's definitely a risk. I think it's pretty clear that Alibaba was singled out, we just don't know where the CCP intends for it to end."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I meant Ma is removed as CEO. I don’t have to google much, follow 13Fs and follow economy news in different languages in diff nation news media. so i’m not getting tricked by one media"
03/28/2021,stocks,With the ccp being increasingly hostile as time goes on I don't think money can hide the problems of the ccp wanting to expand into Tawain which is protected by America. The stunt the ccp pulled on hongkong is already too far and should have left China crippled from sanctions.
03/28/2021,stocks,Right but my point was we’ve got to look at the broader market. Sure BABAs value might have been determined to be $x +\- %. But if the nasdaq is going to take a hit due to wha we are going on with banks liquidated assets they usually get rid of tech/speculative stocks first. So I’m just saying there’s that to consider.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Your concerns are valid, but i'm looking for a 2 week trade.  Aside from that, I still think long term it's in everyone's best interests to get along.  We can say what we want about China, but they do have over a billion people with only 20% to 30% in middle class.  Western business needs this market and are counting on it."
03/28/2021,stocks,Not that I agree with a lot of what the CCP does or want to get too political but who is more hostile: China finally building a navy and some asserting some dominace in its sphere or the US with bases all across the globe while dropping bombs on other countries or over throwing governments around the World?
03/28/2021,stocks,"Got it, good comment, agree, momentum and positioning changes by big players can impact market direction regardless of individual fundamentals.  We also have some Q1 rebalancing coming up, still a question on how that turns."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Yeah I think there’s also some factors people haven’t considered or even heard of. When the feds lowered the SLR rate during the beginning of covid banks started lender more with short term returns in mind. Who got these loans? Hedge funds. Everyone thought it was only gme and amc that got shorted. Last week we found out that over 300 ticketrs are set up for a potential short squeeze. The hedge funds are way too over exposed. (Speculating on jp and Goldman’s recent block sales) and the worst part is citadel is in the hole the deepest. If they go down we could see some major instability. Banks are going to start seeing greater than -3% on the lends they gave out to these hedge funds and start margin calling them - causing squeezes like dominoes and then retail and long whales will liquidate to take in profits and we’ll se an even bigger sell off. 


This is highly speculative but a good chunk is supported by data minus knowing for sure when/how much banks are going to start Margin calling."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Well articulated response, so your saying additional margin calls are going to put downward pressure on stocks.  Gonna have some fun this week going into Q1 close."
03/28/2021,stocks,Well margin calls will create a squeeze first but that’s only a blip before everything comes down. Look at viacomm and discovery and the drops they recently experienced. So things will shoot up for the squeeze then tumble. The concern/something we haven’t seen before is multiple squeezes happening across the market in such a big number. Hedge funds abused the loans the got during covid.
03/28/2021,stocks,"So, does this play out over days, weeks or months?  There are so many ebbs and flows, i'm not even sure what to look for based on your comments?  Are you saying it's time to go short or hedge down side risk to prepare for the unwind?"
03/28/2021,stocks,"We haven’t seen this before. There’s a lot of speculation and I don’t know myself to be honest. Considering citadel is responsible for 47% of retail trading and they’re a hedge fund as well as a market maker (conflict of interest) no one really knows what’s going to happen. Also citadel has been fined something like 58 times. 


I guess I don’t know enough to speculate, but I know enough that there’s a lot of shady shit that happened financially during covid and it’s set up to possibly blow."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Holy crap, if I didn't have enough to worry about.  Thanks for the insight!"
03/28/2021,stocks,Interesting read. Thank you both.
2021-03-28 19:31:12,stocks,"Why I am long DKNG (and you can too) I'll do my best to keep this tight and to the point but informative.

First, positions or ban. I ran the wheel on DKNG last summer but didn't dive too deeply into the company. In January, I bought 25 shares while it was trading \~58. I bought a Jan 2022 90C and June 2021 70C, and I sold those for premium after the rebound two weeks ago.

**What DKNG Is:** Draftkings is a mobile sports betting and daily fantasy sports app. Before sports betting was opened to state-by-state legalization in 2018 by the U.S. Supreme Court, Draftkings' product was daily fantasy sports games. This was a gray area in terms of betting, as DFS are pay-to-play games that pay out prizes to winners, and highly addicting. Draftkings now runs a sportsbook with future and live betting odds.

**Avaliable market:** Sports betting is currently legal in [14 states and D.C.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/13/is-sports-betting-legal-in-my-state.html), representing about 25% of the U.S. population. Many states are expected to legalize it in 2021 or 2022 by either a referendum on the ballot or legislative action. Texas, New York, and California would be massive boons for the betting market, as those states contain the overwhelming majority of the outstanding U.S. population that does not yet have legalized sports betting.

**Market prospects:** Nobody really knows. [An old estimate](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/firms-say-sports-betting-market-to-reach-8-billion-by-2025-2019-11-04) claims $8 billion in revenue for the betting industry by 2025. The industry is way too new in the U.S. But here are [some numbers](https://www.sportspromedia.com/from-the-magazine/us-sports-betting-market-gambling-revenue-states-2021-data) showing the state-by-state proliferation of sports betting (I want to point out for people not familiar with sports betting that $ wagered does not equal revenue -- money must be paid out to the winners. Book revenue is excess wagering not paid out to winners):

>In October 2020, Americans legally bet an estimated US$3 billion on sports for the first time in a single month, according to the American Gaming Association. Sports betting revenue was up nationwide by 53.5 per cent year-over-year to US$237.5 million. In December alone, New Jersey set the national sports betting record for the fifth consecutive month, taking an eye-watering US$996.3 million in bets.  
>  
>Naturally, the decimation of the global sporting calendar meant revenue for the broader gaming industry was down year-over-year, falling 33.5 per cent to US$24.12 billion by October. But it is a measure of betting’s proliferation that six states – Colorado, Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and South Dakota – generated more income from wagering for that month compared to a year ago.

This all happened with a very weak sports calendar because of the pandemic. March Madness was canceled, MLB lost 60% of its season, and NHL and NBA saw long delays. With a full sports calendar in 2021, expect U.S. wagering to climb YOY even more.

**DKNG's prospects:** Like most tech startups, Draftkings is running at a loss. This is largely due to their large marketing outlay. Their revenue is steadily increasing every quarter. They smashed Q4 earnings expectations and [raised their 2021 outlook](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/draftkings-lifts-2021-outlook-4q-125335607.html) as a result:

>DraftKings’ co-founder and CEO Jason Robins said, “In the fourth quarter of 2020, we saw MUPs \[monthly unique payers\] increase 44% to 1.5 million and ARPMUP \[average revenue per monthly unique payer\] increase 55% to $65.”  
>  
>“We are raising our revenue outlook for 2021 due to our expectation for continued growth, the outperformance of our core business and newly launched states that were not included in our previous guidance,” Robins added.  
>  
>...  
>  
>The company raised its FY21 revenue guidance from a range of $750 million to $850 million to a range of $900 million to $1 billion, indicating year-on-year growth of between 40% to 55%. The revenue guidance is driven by the launch of online legal sports betting in the states of Michigan and Virginia and assumes that all professional and college sports events will take place as announced.

Draftkings has inked a new [partnership with UFC](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/draftkings-dkng-ufc-sportsbook-fantasy), and struck a [deal with DISH Network](https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2021/03/dish-and-draftkings-introduce-first-of-its-kind-app-integration/?wpsrc=Organic&wpcn=Organic%20Search&wpscn=Google) that will integrate Dratkings sportbook on DISH interfaces, allowing people to bet on events directly on their TVs while they watch. Draftkings [maintains an exclusive partnership](http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/06/2074556/0/en/DraftKings-Expands-Exclusive-Partnership-with-Major-League-Baseball.html) with MLB, and it's my opinion MLB may want to promote fan engagement with Draftkings as a way to recover lost revenue resulting from the pandemic (MLB was the only major sports league to lose a majority of its season last year). Draftkings also has partnerships with many teams in the NFL, NHL, and NBA, though these are often short-term partnerships and team-by-team, not league-wide.

**Stock outlook:** DKNG started trading last April. Since then, the stock is up about 265%; it is up 42% YTD. The stock hit an intraday ATH of $74.38 last Monday, March 22, and closed the week at $63.60, about 14.5% off its ATH, as part of a larger swoon for tech stocks. The stock experienced choppy trading in 2020 but has been in a strong, 5-month uptrend that started at the beginning of November 2020. Localized volatility in DKNG seems to be part of the overall market anxiety that pounded tech this month. Still, it remains up 10% since that excellent Q4 ER before February 26 trading, and IMO presents a great buying opportunity in this zone.

Some [ETFs with major exposure](https://www.etf.com/stock/DKNG) to DKNG by % allocation or share count include BETZ, BJK, QQQN, ARKW, and VO (by most shares).

**Bear case:** Draftkings undoubtedly benefited from a pandemic-induced closure of in-person betting. Reopening plays that directly challenge Draftkings' market share are MGM, WYNN, and PENN. As casinos, table games, and sportsbooks reopen for in-person betting, that may sap gambling revenues away from mobile betting.

For Draftkings to continue growing at a pace that justifies its stock price, it will need to continue growing its user base. For that to happen, more states need to continue to legalize sports betting. While governments have rarely turned down opportunities to capture new tax revenue, some may still hesitate to do so on the backs of a vice like gambling. Like marijuana, gambling legalization seems to be gaining momentum. But a ballot measure that fails to pass, or a state legislature that fails to agree on legalized sports wagering (or how to allocate the revenues generated thereby) can slow Draftkings' continued growth."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I agree. One thing to keep an eye on is NY. They want the state to run and operate it, similar to the state loto. Plus in RI, people use the website associated with the local casino to place bets, not draft kings."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Nice dd! Much better than the usual “sports betting is gonna be super big so buy draftkings” posts with little regard to its current valuation. I like dkng on this pullback, although it’s a stock that tends to run pretty fast so you have to be ready to take profit with it unless you’re planning on holding long term."
03/28/2021,stocks,Little note but the NFL just added an extra week of regular season football to the schedule for the foreseeable future. All I hear is more gambling opportunities as states legalize
03/28/2021,stocks,"Lots of positive catalysts for DKNG this year with so many states considering legalization and growing user base. 

A massive amount of growth condensed into 2021-2022 bodes well for the stock over the next year or two."
03/28/2021,stocks,What’s your thought on GNOG? Multiple states opening up to online gambling also these days.
03/28/2021,stocks,I think DKNG has some space to correct a bit more. But DKNg is def a good long term play.
03/28/2021,stocks,"I cashed out my DraftKings account and switched to fanduel solely because you can’t make parlays. On fanduel they will let my throw my money away on 10 12 14 leg parlays 
If DK will allow custom parlays I can see them taking over. But until it happens fanduel is superior."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Not really how sport books are gonna be run, each state decides what if any book is going to be allowed to open. Also each state is going to have say how much of percentage of the profits it’s going to take in taxes, licensing or just simply right off the top.... They are also going to have give up all those partnerships with major league sports..."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Thank you!

Sports betting is so young in the USA but it is off to a promising start.

I do like DKNG long term and will see any future drop in the near term like we had last summer as another buying opportunity."
03/28/2021,stocks,DKNG does allow parlays.  And round robbins
03/28/2021,stocks,They didn’t 19-20 nfl season.  If they did 20-21 season I don’t know about it cuz I’m on fanduel. I guess I should’ve researched before posting.  Can you mix player parlays with team parlays?  Like. Example. Can I bet Bucs to win with Scotty Miller scoring a TD and Brady going over 200 yards with fornette going under 65 yards?  I like throwing away my money on fanduel.
03/28/2021,stocks,fanduel is still superior and flutter is the real play here. If they spin off fanduel for an IPO. Oh boy
2021-03-28 19:17:31,stocks,"Coursera: A DD Introduction Disclaimer: This is my first DD, so please forgive any gaps, omissions, or mistakes. I welcome any and all (constructive) comments and criticisms. Secondly, as is obligatory, *this is not to be construed as financial advice*.

&#x200B;

**Factual Summary:**

&#x200B;

Coursera (ticker: COUR) is an online learning platform (it is available for perusal at [coursera.org](https://coursera.org) for the curious) . It has been in the industry for over a decade, having been founded by Stanford alums and professors  Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, as an alternative to the more traditional analogue schooling system; it is considered a powerhouse in its field. During this time it has been privately traded at a consistent annual loss despite market popularity. However, it has nearly 80 million users worldwide and is highly rated in the industry. I strongly suspect this fact is itself a main driver in the decision for the company to go public.

&#x200B;

The date of Coursera's IPO onto the NYSE is March 31st, 2021--this coming Wednesday. A definitive price point for shares will not be announced until the day before the company enters the market, but analysts and those snottily claiming to be ""in the know"" speculate a range of $29-$36 per share. At inception, there will be approximately 16 million shares available for trading. Roughly calculated, that is a market total of almost $500,000,000. This relegates them to the small-cap investment level. Currently I have been able to locate only one investment fund with holdings in Coursera, SuRo Capital, which invests strictly in privately held companies (you may view the rest of their portfolio at [surocap.com/portfolio](https://surocap.com/portfolio)). At this point in time, Coursera is this fund's largest holding.  


**Analysis:**

&#x200B;

From what I have been able to ascertain, Coursera is a ripe pick for the speculative short-term trader, and possibly even for the investor looking for a long-term hold. The stock itself has proven to be volatile, but not uncomfortably so. The fact that management is pushing for an IPO is, to me, indicative of a desire to move from the small-cap investment level into the larger arena. At this point in time, Coursera would be one of the only online learning platforms to make this move--a market indicator for the future perhaps? (Insight: Already one of Coursera's main competitors, Udemy, has announced its intention to IPO later this year, likely so that it can observe the relative success or failure of its industry sibling and rival to gain insights.)

&#x200B;

I strongly suspect that Coursera's price point will move with high velocity in the opening days. It is not beyond the realm of believability that it should double on its first day of trading. This point in time to me represents a Goldilocks zone--not too hot, not too cold, but just right. Especially considering the fact that SuRo Capital does not traditionally hold stock for very long in publicly traded companies--as Coursera comprises roughly 17% of SuRo's current portfolio, this is a relevant observation--the opportunity for substantial profits at IPO may not be replicated again for some time, allowing for a palatable purchase price for those wanting a long-term hold just as much as those seeking a short-term profit."
03/28/2021,stocks,I love the product but not sure about the price. How are earnings and revenue?
03/28/2021,stocks,"Where did you find the IPO date?  

It looks like the prospectus was recently filed on 3/5/21 (and subsequently amended on 3/22/21).  After the prospectus is filed, it can take months until a company starts trading on NYSE.  As far as I can tell, there is currently no known IPO date...it will probably be later this year."
03/28/2021,stocks,"They're a bit in debt. With companies of this size, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. A little debt = more credit offered, it's a reliable way for lenders to generate revenue for themselves. This is probably one of the main reasons for Coursera going public, to generate revenue and expand. I expect they're trying to reach the $1B cap and move up to the next investment level."
03/28/2021,stocks,"It's on iposcoop.com and elsewhere. I'm not sure, but it seems pretty definite."
2021-03-28 18:56:56,stocks,"Why is Discovery cheap right now?

03/28/2021,stocks,The long was liquidated to cover the short. They are saying they were over extended on short positions that got called and have to liquidate the longs in their portfolio to cover capital requirements. They're is a lot of possibilities with bond rates and SLR rules yada yada yada but it's a good sign. Many more block trades coming with anyone who went short on movies and games. Not financial advice but made everything liquid for this and will load up on discounted blue chips in the coming months. Have to run the last 10 years balance sheets for Viacom and Discovery as not watching them currently but it could be a nice entry with an unexpected selloff.
03/28/2021,stocks,"The price would tank because the fund was forced to sell assets it did have (discovery, Viacom, ten cent, etc) in order to cover its short exposure that it didn’t/doesn’t have... 

The sales being pre market blocks that Goldman and another bank offered with no regard to trying to maximize money on the way out is highly suggestive of a forced liquidation. 

Most is speculation beyond the known that massive blocks of shares (I believe the Viacom position was in excess of a billion dollars) were sold wholesale and rapidly."

Companies will continue to push for ways to replace workers with automation, especially with the push to raise minimum wage.

I am only making this post in order to inform people of some strategies to **protect** their equities and investments and thus themselves. 

You can call me crazy or any name you think of, that is okay and will not bother me, just at the very least save this post, then go on with your day. I am not a financial advisor, in fact I am unemployed, and my previous job was a crappy service gig that had nothing to do with finance and only earned me $17/hour, so I am technically a bum right now. My username is the product of a long time gamertag I used when playing a Hunter on World of Warcraft + I really liked the movie Step Brothers. I am just some random dude trying to bring you some helpful advice in the event of a worst case scenario.

&#x200B;

# Few Tips for what to do you do in the event of a fire sale?

&#x200B;

***A loss on a trade is only solidified when you sell***

* This may lead to the question, **How do I know when to sell?** If you have high conviction in your long term positions within your portfolio and **you still believe in them long term, Just maintain them through the fire.** Trades on stock investments only risk becoming completely worthless in the event of **Bankruptcy.** If your investment is not within reasonable risk of bankruptcy, there is a good chance it can recover. Add this to your thought process when determining if you should sell any investments.

***Only put money into the stock market that you can afford to lose***

* If your life is hanging in the balance on your portfolio then you need to pay close attention to the market more than anybody. Take time to really educate yourself using resources much better than I can provide, if you haven't already. Always maintain a big/long term view.
* If you are a bear waiting to **""time the drop""** then it would be safe to operate under the assumption there could always be lots of more volatility ahead. Some firesale deals may look very good on the surface, but should not stop you from conducting extensive research on them.

# If you deal with any investments that have even a remote possibility of a margin call, then you should be the ones on the highest alert

* Always assume the worst and constantly run estimates/calculations on your worst case scenarios
* if you are a **novice investor** and just said **""what does margin call mean exactly?""** then you should probably not be messing with these types of financial instruments in the first place. When I say these type of financial instruments I mean things like **Naked option contracts, covered calls, margin trading, and short selling etc.**

&#x200B;

If there was any tips that are wrong or I missed please feel free to add more or correct me in the comments and I will make edits. Like I said, I am closer to an idiot than an expert, so my words should not be treated like gospel just something to consider down the road."

03/28/2021,stocks,"“Only put money into the stock market that you can afford to lose”

This is misleading/inaccurate advice. 

I might tell someone this if they were buying a speculative risky stock at $200, knowing there’s a scenario in which it could go to $20 or less. Most people could not stomach that kind of loss. That’s also not really investing, it’s more like gambling. I would also give the same advice concerning options. Single stock investments can go to zero, they can decline by a large percentage and never recover. It is known. 

But if you never invest anything in the stock market because you’re afraid to “lose” it, I’ve got news. Cash is a guaranteed 1-2% loss every year you hold it. You need to take some risk with your money to achieve any kind of return. If you don’t, you will be grinding it out for a lot longer than you have to and possibly be left with not enough money to ever retire or leave to your kids. Sitting out is losing out. 

The key is taking the right risk. No, you shouldn’t invest any money you need for the bills or the mortgage, and you should have an emergency fund of at least 3 months expenses. If youre planning a big expense in the next year or two, definitely don’t put everything into the market. But beyond that, I would never consider money put in broad market index funds as money I could potentially never get back. 

Even if you had the worst timing you could have ever had in the last 20 years, and invested once in VFIAX at the absolute worst moment in 2007 before the financial crisis, you’d still have your money back within the decade (6 years later according to the chart, but actually sooner because of dividends). Meanwhile, if you had stayed invested, your money is now worth almost 3x as much.  

If you put that money under the mattress instead, your money is now worth 27% less. No joke. You lost nearly a third of your money doing jack shit. 

So let’s not go into this with the attitude “don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.” The right attitude is, don’t gamble your money away, instead, make smart, diversified investments. You won’t “lose” it if you make the smart choice. History shows that in the worst case scenario, you’d still do better over time than burying the money in the backyard."

You made a bet and it did not pay off. There's no guarantee the stock will recover in the near term, if ever. You're being sentimental about the money you lost instead of looking for a stock that has sound fundamentals and is currently growing.

You can't, nobody can. Not without taking large risks and/or getting lucky.

Forget about the past (well, don't forget, learn from it but don't dwell on it) and move forward.

I'm not going to discredit it, but the only reliable leading indicator from what I've read is yield curve inversion.

the charts are misleading because during a a depression or reccession  the p/e goes up because company profits drop rapidly. A high p/e while  company profits are still rising is bullish

So its currently overvalued cause they expect even more profits

what do you think about?"
03/28/2021,stocks,"The Schiller P/E can tell you a lot, you just have to think about why the P/E was or was not high at a certain time. The recession and the high values resulting from low profits are not quite correct. During dotcom bubble was not an economic crisis, the prices for the companies were just extremely high. In addition, the key interest rate also influences the level of the value, low interest rates lead to high values.

Of course, it is also questionable to what extent the composition of the S&P500 has an influence on the value. More and more tech stocks (which on average have a high P/E) make up large parts of the entire index. Since this is a cross-sectional data panel, this effect is not taken into account here. The Schiller P/E can therefore very well say something, but only in combination with other findings and influences."

03/28/2021,stocks,"Another trend to check out for indications of overly bullish or bearish market conditions (diagnostic not prognostic) is the number of IPOs and SPACs that hit the market year to year.

Check out the table in the bottom-left of www.spacanalytics.com of SPAC and IPO activity to see data since 2003. 

By their data, in 2007, there were 299 IPOs in the US, vs 47 in 2008. In 2014, there were 258, and dropped a bit to 111 by 2016 during a bit of market stagnation. In 2020, there have been 450. Thus far in 2021, there have been 377."

03/28/2021,stocks,"It's not ""the end"" of Tesla. It's just an overbought stock. It happens. Tesla won't go anywhere soon. It was holding 800. Then it was trying to hold low 700s. Now we see it trying to hold mid 600s. It's a ""slow bleed"" to somewhere and I'm not sure exactly where. In all honesty if it fell to 300 it's only considered a ""deal"" due to where it traded previously. Bitcoin pricing also matters a lot to Tesla. Tesla needs a good catalyst or it'll fall below 500 as a norm in the short term. No idea what the future holds. I'm not as bullish on EV even if it's the future. Auto companies where never a popular investment but now we think they are because they will be producing electric vehicles. 

Autonomous vehicles are the only tech I see as a disruptive technology that will change things dramatically but a vehicle doesn't need to be electric powered to be autonomous.

I'm glad Tesla exists so we can talk about it everyday. It's a high risk high reward play. Lots of people made a lot of money. I like Elon Musk. I don't like TSLA valuation."

03/28/2021,stocks,EV was red on friday because of nio's production stop due to chip shortage.
03/28/2021,stocks,"I think the Tesla hype is slowly coming to an end. There are the following reasons for this:

Tesla is getting serious competition; the demand for EVs can now be met by other companies. Market share is shrinking in all markets and will shrink even more in the coming months.

FSD is a big lie. Elon has been promising it would be available next year since 2015. What is the problem now? Many people spent 10k on the potential for FSD. But now years have passed and people may have already bought a new car in the meantime. The 10k was totally wasted. And Tesla itself has admitted that FSD is only level 2 and this will not get better in the near future. 

Gruenheide is properly delayed. No cars will come off the assembly lines there in the summer. Completely impossible.

You can also see that Elon's ass is on the line. He tries to hide all this bad news with one smoke grenade after the other. The bitcoin purchase, his appointment as technoking, etc. The house of cards is slowly collapsing and people are realizing that they own a non-profitable car company that will only have single digit market share in a few years and can't build robotiaxis."

But with Feds looking to shrink money supply or at least won’t be increasing as economy get back to normal and increase competition, I just don’t think TSLA will see those predictions from ARKK aka Cathy. I would not be surprised if we hit low $500 before a bounce. Likely $500-$700 range. All these Tesla fanboys talk about FSD, robotaxi,...etc actually have been priced in! I mean how long did it took Apple to get to $1T. It took TSLA less than a year to hit $1T more or less! It was actually pricing in we shipped Tesla to Mars!"
03/28/2021,stocks,Chip shortages will make it a rough month for EV stocks or IMO a great time to buy the dip
03/28/2021,stocks,"What would you rather own?

[pets.com](https://pets.com) or chewy?

AOL or Google?

IBM or Apple?

Being first is almost never equals long term success"
03/28/2021,stocks,They said the same shit years ago about Volkswagen. These companies now need to clear the hurdles in EV Tesla cleared long ago. Sell it and regret it forever.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Tesla is clearly in a bear trend and will continue to drop over time in the foreseeable future.
That’s my opinion. It would take some huge news to change that. Tesla only makes money from Bitcoin and selling regulatory credits (google “Tesla's Profits Are Not From Selling Cars”). I know about the future potential from the fanboys, but it should not be priced in 1000 times due to all the uncertainties. With rising interest rates (and A LOT of competition) etc., money is moving to companies that actually generate a lot of cash."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Its the end of the tesla as meme stock, not tesla. Slowly people are waking to the fact that its price isnt justified, no I dont think it will come up to 800 dollars anytime soon, it will fall to around 400$ imo. A 1000 p/e ratio should tell pretty clearly whats what. Volkswagen has 15 p/e ratio."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Tesla was over valued based on its current sales and has been corrected.

Will it fall to $300 highly unlikely.   Will it raise to $800 in a few weeks also highly unlikely.

Looking at reports it should be a little over $800 in 12 months or within.   

Tesla on the current thresholds will keep it balancing between $620 and $700 for bit as it seems to have found its home even with its high viotility.   

Even Kathy Wood thinks Tesla is a long hold looking at 4-5 years out as their sales growth catches up to their share cost.

As far as other companies catching up, that isn’t happening if you read the reports it will take them 3-5 years to catch up to where Tesla is now with EV and by then Tesla will be so far ahead it won’t be a race.

I own some shares in Tesla when it was in the after split price and some in the $800 range.   

The problem with Tesla for now is it found its spot, like it or not.   So if you are getting into Tesla go Tesla long.   

This is only my opinion I don’t provide financial advice."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I think Tesla is worth max $70 a share. I may be in the minority, but there are respected, big name analysts, who agree.  It’s been around a while now, but it is still a 100% upstart with zero real operating profit. No way it can compete with VW, Daimler, GM."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I bought a 500 shares of TSLA during the current dip.  I am not concerned about VW at all.

I have a Porsche Cayenne S, 911S and a BMW.  They all have a few things in common, the electrical sucks, the plastic sucks.  The metal is great (engine and body).  That's the opposite of what EV needs.  I have no doubt that VW EV owners will have to replace the battery around 5-7 years of ownership.

Typical car companies save the newest features for the best model.   TSLA is not doing this (the Model Y has newer/better features than the model X).  I agree with this approach.

I've not met an actual TSLA owner that is pissed off because of the delay in FSD.  Infact, I've know more people w/o FSD than with.  That's great for TSLA.  By the time FSD gains traction, there will be a ton of vehicles w/o FSD hitting the used market.  All TSLA needs to do is adding FSD to those vehicles and turn them around for a 5-10k extra profit.

The current US electrical grid is not suitable for large scale EV adoption.  To level out the demand, whole house battery/solar system is needed, TSLA definitely has a horse in this race.

China is a very important market and TSLA is the AAPL of the Chinese EV market.  Sure there are tons of local brands phone with more features at a lesser price,  the iPhone still has great profit from the Chinese market.  Tesla will be the same - a #1 choice among the richer part of the population.  EU EVs will also share this richer population but w/o the benefit of a local factory.

Other smaller EV companies are just noise.  Things only get serious when AAPL and Toyota enter the market.

TSLA is also a b-i-t-c-o-i-n holding company.  While many people may thing it's a negative,  I think it's a good thing for the company.  it's not much different from McDonald is as much as real estate company as a fast food company.  It sets the low for the company values.


Most people would agree that last month TSLA has seen very significant drop.  Look at the data,  it's more than $10/week.  However I also lower my cost basis by $8-$10/week selling CC while waiting for the chip shortage to lift and the cyber truck to roll out.  Now if TSLA drops down to the $500 then I won't be able to sell CC at my original purchase price and may have to hold.  I'll worry about that when the time comes.

If you can't effort to get 100 shares of TSLA, it's not a stock for you.  The ability to get high premium consistently is the key during the chip shortage period - ""get paid while you wait"" should the slogan for owning TSLA stock.

When TSLA hit 380 during the battery day week,  some people wanted to wait for 350 to get in.  They've been waiting ever since.  To be fair,  I bought a bunch of shares at 380 just to have them called away quickly after at 450.  The shares that I held got sold at the limit order of $695 not too long after that."
03/28/2021,stocks,"It's not the end of Tesla. but it is the end of the hype. 

(a) IMO fair value is somewhere near $350. This is sort of a mid-point for a variety of estimates from analysts who aren't in the Tesla cult, ranging from about $100 to $500. every stock eventually settles near fair value, which is why valuation matters in the first place. 

(b) any time a stock shoots straight up on the chart, like Tesla did, the stock WILL come back down. it's inevitable. spikes straight upwards are not driven by changes in the company's sales status and financial info but by irrational investor behavior that is always corrected. 

(c) Tesla is only narrowly profitable, and that's from selling regulatory credits to other car markers. Once other companies start selling more EVs, they won't need to buy the green credits from Tesla

(d) Elon is nuts. he has a history of making strange statements that undermine his role at the company and weaken his image."
03/28/2021,stocks,"This market share metric is currently huge load of shit ATM. They make it seem Tesla is losing shares quite rapidly. Conceptually, when company A has 100% market share and then company B comes along and launches a similar product, company A naturally loses it market share when even just one person buying Company B's product.

Tesla's EVs are currently superior to it competitors. Look at what Volkswagen offers vs Tesla and you'll notice at the same MSRP you get more from Tesla."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Tesla are more than a car company, their energy business will dwarf the car sector."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Overbought, yes, but Tesla is not just a car company."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Tesla never 'lost' any market to VW? VW was and will be the biggest car manufacturer for quite some time. And Tesla keeps growing, they still could sell more cars than they currently can produce. In fact Tesla keeps earning market share currently.

Don't look at the EV only market share. You should look at the total car market share.

And car manufactureres usually have a P/E of ~10.

The more mature Telsa will become, the closer it gets to this P/E.

With the current growth you would basically assume Tesla will be the only car manufacturer left on the world in some years. The explosive growth of Tesla is basically over and Tesla may even underperform for the next years."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Volkswagen has a incredibly sketchy past when it comes to being environmentally friendly, they don’t care, they just want a quick buck and I believe that will come through once again.

There is no situation where I’d go for a Volkswagen over Tesla. Although Europeans have a weird thing for German cars"
03/28/2021,stocks,"I think they are grossly overvalued.

Even if they are a tech company hybrid my dcf got them as being in the 400 range for stock price.

I could be wrong but still, no margin of safety for me.

03/28/2021,stocks,Ford is going to be releasing an e-F150 soon and at that time it will be game over for the absolutely ridiculous looking trapezoid that is the Cybertruck. The Tesla Cybertruck is the modern day design version of the Pontiac Aztek. Google it. Lol.
03/28/2021,stocks,It's not just Volkswagen bro.
03/28/2021,stocks,no it isn’t
03/28/2021,stocks,No.
03/28/2021,stocks,What people fail to understand is that Tesla needs widespread EV adoption so the introduction of EVs from other manufacturers is a positive catalyst. They do not need to maintain their marketshare to justify a much higher share price.
03/28/2021,stocks,It didn’t broke the Support. Also VAG are keep delaying their VW and SKODA models dates. It was for FEB this year. After that March. After That June. Now VW and SKODA cars will be first delivered in JULY... you can pre-order the cars but without seeing them. I still don’t understand sometimes ppl ordering a car like pair of jeans 😄
03/28/2021,stocks,Yes. Tesla is going bankrupt tomorrow. Sell it all.
03/28/2021,stocks,"In a way, yes. TSLA isn't going out of business, but it's stock price will decay for the next 12 months. Probably to sub $100 a share."

03/28/2021,stocks,"I don't hold Tesla. I put abit of money into Daimler instead when I started investing not long ago.  


I'm looking forward to where it will go, so far a bit gains for me, and I'm interesting to see how market will respond when they revail the EQS on april 15. th. They say come with battery that has range of over 700 km (437 miles). [News of the EQS](https://www.daimler.com/innovation/digitalisation/industry-4-0/battery-production-hedelfingen.html)  


Also looks like they have entered joint venture with Volvo about fuel cell production.  


So while Tesla might have robotaxi comming, it will be interesting to see if Daimler trucks will come with self-driving trucks. I would imagine there would be more money in that than taxi driving. [Daimler selfdriving truck](https://www.daimler.com/innovation/case/autonomous/automated-driving-daimler-trucks.html) But other companies is also researching this e.g. scania have gotten green light by swedish government to test self driving trucks on the free ways.  


So while many hails Tesla for self driving and that they soon will have robotaxi, I think other companies a not far behind in making selfdriving vihicles.   


It won't be end of Tesla as they also have other things going for them. But I can't justify their current price to myself."
03/28/2021,stocks,It’ll get back up there but I think it’s going lower first

03/28/2021,stocks,"Most tech stocks are still down right now from February because of the 10 year yields and possible inflation, it’s not just Tesla. Also media has been going at them hard the last couple months to drive the price down. VW and Ford releasing EV’s (still haven’t seen a single one) and a couple crashed they’ve tried to blame on autopilot. (One guy was speeding and crashed into a trailer. The other one two underaged kids backed into a police car. AP can’t reverse). Nothing really new though. Tesla gets trashed more than any other company other than amazon. They’re opening up 2 brand new gigafactories in Austin and Berlin in the next year or so. (India wants in too) Have new battery tech coming out in about a year or so. Have the cybertruck, Semi, roadster, refreshed X and S... not even getting started in their energy and future autonomous driving business.

And tesla is not only EV play. They have AI software and EV batteries."
03/28/2021,stocks,Its not just vw. Ford mustang mach e is pretty slick. As more and more manufacturers jump into the electric car game the smaller the market share tesla will have.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Autonomous vehicles don’t need to be electric powered (there will soon be long range robo trucks for highways) but in a robotaxi network, they need to be for cost per mile benefits.   That’s where the major disruption will come from, if fleets will adequately substitute for personal ownership for many people.

Expect the young and old to use them—first group won’t have enough money for cars, and second is less willing or able to drive.  There would be many who first learn to drive at 30 instead of 16."
03/28/2021,stocks,"In addition, I wonder if Tesla fanboys today care of Tesla’s future more than Elon himself.

For the inexperienced investors holding Tesla stock, it can be seen as a precious, unique ticket to riches and validation.
In a market full of uncertainties and risks, there is their certainty of success. They see it as irreplaceable because they can’t see any alternative.

For Musk, Tesla is largely Mission Accomplished. It kickstarted - or at least accelerated - the switch to EV. It helped bring a change on the world.

What’s left equally amazing for Tesla to do? Sell lots of cars? So unglamorous, not a goal worthy of a visionary.
Revolutionize self driving? Many extremely skilled companies are already working on it. It’s not an unique opportunity to make a difference. Green energy? Same story.

If Elon wants to aim again for the moon, he probably needs to move his attention progressively away from Tesla. And that’s what I expect him to do.
Rockets, AI, cyber interfaces, are some of the objects that have long been on his mind.

A funny idea, what happens if Musk founds a new company to work full time on some new, ambitious world changing goal? Where does that leave Tesla shareholders betting on future something-or-the-other, Tesla-is-an-everything-company? Hanging on to the dreams of yesterday?

Among the potential risks facing Tesla investors there should be, written in capital letters: Musk goes to do something else."

03/28/2021,stocks,"the thing is , no one else is working on FSD.

so right now tsla has the lead on that.

simply replacing gas engine with electric doesn't make someone a competitor. basic electric cars still have to be driven manually

i'm not dumb, i recognize competition. I'm not fully bullish, but I was stupid to enough to hold tsla at an average cost of 720."

03/28/2021,stocks,"This! And the fact they make money on their carbon offsets and, just would never bet against Musk. He is smarter than most. I have bought the dip as well and even bought some calls for April/May. May be a little too early, but Tesla will be fine.
Technicals don’t matter in this market."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Genuine question. 

Tesla is losing money for every EV they sell, is VW also doing the same?"
03/28/2021,stocks,"As if Tesla is any better.

The new giga factory in Germany needs huge amounts of water and the official water supplier already has complains that the huge water usage will drain the ground water there.

I personally see more value in the vehicle being a hybrid, easier to travel cross-country, but I think the demand for the Tesla lies both in the fact that it is ridiculous looking vehicle, and that it is full electric."

03/28/2021,stocks,Yes. There are many other EV companies as well. Europe knows it...but many Americans never heard of other car brands. I tried to make simple text.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Indeed, you can’t be first to market without losing market share. It reminds me of the endless stream of articles, back in the day, that fretted over android market share vs AAPL."

03/28/2021,stocks,"Even with the supposed delays, Tesla did not gain on market shares. This is not good.

Perhaps Tesla has markets other than EV, but that really remains to be seen and not as well developed as their EV products"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Tesla is currently the car manufacturer which is the most worth on the planet while having a market share of 1 or 2 percent ...

In fact Tesla is worth more than VW and Toyota together!

Call me stupid, but I would call that overvalued."
03/28/2021,stocks,Always love the hearing the Musk is a real life Tony Stark fantasy...
03/28/2021,stocks,"True, Tesla is the mistress for the moment, SpaceX is the wife.  Once Starlink is making big revenue, I think Musk will devote most of his effort to it."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Yes, but Spacex/Starlink are not part of Tesla. Spacex is a separate entity."

03/28/2021,stocks,"the home battery business is ultra tiny, not even worth a billion. Satellite and spacex are independent companies and do not belong to Tesla.

03/28/2021,stocks,"Tesla is a Tech and Engineering company (Elon has been quoted saying specifically they're an engineering company). Their most known successful products are their Vehicles, Solar Roofs, Home Power Storage, Batteries and Power Grid tech. Tesla commonly partners with Elon's other companies including SpaceX which launches satellites."

03/28/2021,stocks,"That wasn't my point with the Volkswagen reference.

In their early days, Amazon and Facebook and P/E ratios that were through the roof, and most mainstream investors said surely it was a bubble. But they never crashed or faced any major corrections, the earnings slowly caught up to the price. Then slowly the bears realized they had ignored network adoption effects, and were valuating it wrong all along. We will witness the same thing with Tesla."

03/28/2021,stocks,"Wood is an asset manager. She should not even be opining on valuation, I would have thought that was illegal for her to do. Her obvious desperation in coming up with hyperbole is the most disconcerting, she sounds more like a Madoff salesperson than a manager responsible for other people’s assets"
03/28/2021,stocks,"I honestly don't know if they are but EV market as whole is quite in a development phase, so perhaps."
03/28/2021,stocks,Yeah vw isn’t profiting from their selling their EVs. I believe they plan to profit from the tax advantages and possible packages sold with their cars. But not their cars itself.

The energy storage market will inevitably increase secularly through time to be a good fraction of petroleum industry today—and selling electronics and control software beyond deploying in their own systems will be profitable and less cyclical than automotive.

I don't know if this recent liquidation is just due to a poorly managed fund having a fire sale creating great buying opportunities, or the leverage artificially inflated stock prices previously and the prices are now coming down to fairer value.   **DISCK** traded between $20 and $30 for the last 5 years, then in the last 3 months shot up to $60.  Now it's back to $30 which might be where it really should be.  Definitely worth keeping an eye on future liquidations.

03/28/2021,stocks,"You've got to know a guy on the inside if you want to succeed in the Chinese market, because numbers available to the public are all cooked. Those on the inside are operating at a massive advantage, and there is no regulation, so the chances of you bag holding are high. By the time you can, with your limited view into the market, identify a power house from a scam, the stock's already over valued. You may still be able to make a bit of money from continued expansion, but it's not even going to be close to investing in an Amazon or a Tesla back in the day.

And even then, Chinese regulations can change quickly depending on government priorities, and as an international investor, the chances of you identifying those changes quickly enough to pump or dump before those on the inside do, is low. So as a rule - the Chinese share holders will always move first, while international stock holders will inevitably bag hold; there's not much you can do about it."

2021-03-28 11:52:43,stocks,"Don’t catch falling knife, don’t buy at all time highs, don’t buy over valued, wait for dip. Is a false strategy and should be ignored. Disclaimer: this is only advice for long term investors.
Most of the best stocks I’ve bought were at all time highs or close to. In bull market it feels like a great buy if pull back comes like last few months you question why you bought too high or why you even bought it.
If you bought something planning to hold for years just get in if you like the price. Chalk it up to bad timing because buying dip at bottom is rare.
Buying stocks when market is red for weeks and down 30-40% isn’t easy. Buying on way up sounds easy but who knows if it’s just a good week.

Point is, covid crash taught us you can’t time it, buying at those prices seems no brainer today. But also seeing your gains gone and dumping more  money into market a month into pandemic seems like suicide then.

If you like a company long, get in. If you were correct on the  company the price 5 years from now won’t matter."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Indices are always at ATHs. They average about 20 per year, or one new ATH every other week. Every ATH has in its wake a string of previously-ATHs. They're nothing to fear."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I somewhat agree.

I think it ultimately comes down to this. Just because a stock has gone down doesn't mean it's worth buying, and just because it's gone up doesn't mean it's not worth buying.

I do think some people put too much focus on 'buying the dip'"
03/28/2021,stocks,">	If you like a company long, get in. If you were correct on the company the price 5 years from now won’t matter.

Big IF there. What if you were wrong? Risk management includes accounting for the possibility that you are wrong.

You should consider both the upside potential of being right, and the downside if it turns out you were wrong.

Essentially, you seem to go from a perspective that stocks only go up long term, which is false.
Indexes have been historically going up, individual stocks are a different story. Beware of conflating the two."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Another thing to note, no one here is a proven financial adviser. If you are moving your stocks because some stranger on the internet said you are buying the wrong stock. You should reconsider your investment strategy"
03/28/2021,stocks,"You can always increase your net gain by buying at dips to lowering your average cost. If you strongly believe in your convictions, then why not buy at dip? I agree with rest of sentiment tho."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I have to disagree with this. Especially on the part of Covid-19 crash. I bought a lot of stocks in the crash. Didn't hit the absolute bottom. Bought some too early, bought some too late.Nevertheless, they turned out to be excellent buys. I wouldn't call it luck. When prices fall 30% or more, you can be sure there's a lot of over-reacting in the game.

>Point is, covid crash taught us you can’t time it, buying at those  prices seems no brainer today. But also seeing your gains gone and  dumping more  money into market a month into pandemic seems like suicide  then.

It may feel bad to invest more but that is just a mental block. You have to get over with it to benefit from low prices. A good mindset is to look forward to crashes. 

I am a long term investor too. I have my selection of companies I want to own. But I want to have them with low prices. So I time my buying. I am convinced it can be done. And low purchase prices really matter when one does the aftermath."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Couldn‘t agree more with you. But the problem is, that most of the people (I‘m counting myself in as well unfortunately), still hope for the quick and easy games in hours or days and get frustrated if they don‘t achieve it in that timeframe. 
So the best advice I can get is, if you like the company and what it is doing. Invest in it and „forget it“ but also keep some money in the pocket to play on any short term bets. 
With this strategy you won‘t sell your investment when it‘s red to invest in where you expect to make quick profit."
03/28/2021,stocks,"good point! 

fact is profitable stock market is as boring and takes much longer than waiting for paint to dry.

03/28/2021,stocks,"I partly agree but also party disagree. If you're gonna invest you want the most from your money and you want to optimal returns (as possible). 

If someone keeps buy at highs, they'll will average higher and won't get the best return for their money.

Adding positions at a cheaper price WILL add up in the long run, all you have to do is wait."
03/28/2021,stocks,just always buy and be happy
03/28/2021,stocks,The market spends a large fraction of its time at all time highs. Not buying then is dumb.
03/28/2021,stocks,Buy high and sell higher. Be confident a trend is happening before you buy in
03/28/2021,stocks,I agree. All those advices just boil down to market timing which is impossible to do.
03/28/2021,stocks,"yep, for sure many taught Tesla is at the top at $400."
03/28/2021,stocks,Invest everything into HYLN falling knife. Got it!
03/28/2021,stocks,"Solid advice if applied to total stock market index or sp500. Same advice would also work when one buys a quality business for fair price. However, if you overpaid, even if business is solid, you need to reevaluate your abilities. Just because overpriced business is down 10% does not necessarily means its at fair value."
03/28/2021,stocks,It’s a great strategy though has been skewed by the asset bubble the fed has created.  Remove seven trillion from the Fed’s balance sheet. Balance the federal budget because if history has taught us anything about fiat currency it is that this is going to end well.  Then valuations will be more in line with historical expectations. That is a 50 percent haircut across the board from here.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Say that to those who invested in S&P500 in a year 2000. Just zoom out and let the thought of that sink in. It would take 13 years to get back where they were in 2000. In fact they were back in late 2007, but 2008 wiped 50% of the value again. Last 10ish years of bull run doesn't mean that it will continue forever."
03/28/2021,stocks,Buying on dips and big red days isn’t all that hard and does make a difference.  🤷🏾‍♀️
03/28/2021,stocks,"I prefer to look for a stock that bottoms out.

Perhaps the saying could be better said this way:

""Don't catch a falling knife. Pick up those that are on the floor.""

People who focus on falling knives tend to be focused on one stock. The problem is that there are many. 

Some stocks moved up quickly after the COVID bottom while others took a while move back up; and with good reason.

There's always a group of companies available at a good price that have hit a bottom. I don't need wait for only one particular stock to hit a bottom."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Totally agree! My first Amazon buy was when the day it hit $1000 for the first time. Sure, it dipped something like -10% a few months after but there was no way of knowing, I was happy with what I got. Timing the market is almost impossible"
03/28/2021,stocks,"good comments, i would add, buy stocks if you think they are under valued, in the long term, the valuation should come to fruition.  like you said, just bc it is an all time high, does not mean it wont go higher, and on the dip, it can trade lower.  look at Amazon, how many times it has traced back from all time highs"
03/28/2021,stocks,So your advice is to time the market?
03/28/2021,stocks,these don’t seem like any more of a false strategy than expecting everything to always be better in x years because it was in the past
03/28/2021,stocks,"I asked my dad about this last month when I finally started investing, he’s not a financial adviser at all.
But, he’s been in the market most of his adult
Life, so understands it a bit. I told him I was looking at getting into JNJ, KO and a few others. I asked him if I should wait for a dip or just get in. He told
Me that with companies like JNJ, KO and others are just ones you want to buy and get into it because since they are long term investments it doesn’t matter if it’s high, low or somewhere in the middle when you buy in as those stocks will always give you a return in the long run, unless you need to sell some at the same
time the market corrects, which is just bad luck."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I generally agree depending on your confidence in the company’s financial future.

This advice does not hold up well when considering companies such as Cisco and even Microsoft to an extent in 2000.

You do need to make sure that the company does not have too much room to fall during a downturn so odds are the price will usually recover even at ATHs."
03/28/2021,stocks,"People chasing quick gains, what are you doing with the money?

Are people day trading, trying to catch dips to buy a new TV or graphics card?

Just be lazy like myself and let it ride, catch the tax break for long term gains and don't worry about shit day to day or even year to year."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I've said it before and I'll say it again, DCA all the way!"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Only advice I think all should use is this: don’t use market orders. Unless you like your buy/sell price to be a surprise, then by all means."
03/28/2021,stocks,I agree in principal but next 10 yrs of SPY are looking pretty grim with projected 2% yr on yr....May as well get into bonds? Otherwise it’s growth stocks which are scary to hold over time.
03/28/2021,stocks,"For the longest time it was sound advice, but with the mass entrance of new retail investors and access to information the game is changing, as should investing mantras"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Stocks, as a whole, actually only go up. 
Yea, it’s a meme, but in reality the market returns 7-9% per year on average depending a bit of where you invest.

Nasdaq 10-14% if you look back 10 or 15 years. Dow 7-10%. So stocks go up. Not all, but most, and most of the time. 

And quality is expensive. Very few are successful bargain bin hunting, there are plenty of value traps out there and no, 4% dividend is not a good return. It’s 1/3 to 1/2 of what the market, on average, returns.

So, 100% with OP. If you’re in the long game, buy a good company, buy more in a dip, and delete app for 5-10 years."
03/28/2021,stocks,Price still matters look at Cisco but generally speaking your correct
03/28/2021,stocks,"While your advice is good, psychologically I'm still partial to buying into companies that I'm interested in on dips. In practice it probably limits my upside, but I'm a big fan of minimizing my downside too and have been pretty good at that by waiting until they drop a % I like."

03/28/2021,stocks,"Sounds a lot like a ""Buy high, sell low"" subliminal message. 

Anyone who sold on dip (large market caps) and bought same stocks in April or May made gains by end of 2020. Those who long the stocks are around break even today. So time in market always win out, regardless which strategy one uses.

03/28/2021,stocks,"Sorry but waiting for the dip it is a good strategy more even if you’re planning to hold for the long term. Long time investors cannot disregard the strategies you highlight in the title.

There are falling knives that do continue falling for extended periods of time and there are too many options on other stocks have that kind of risk appetite 

Buy at the dip and take profit are top strategies. Example Think of those buying solid AAPL at 130. Look at it now. Do you want it long term? For what reason exactly? It only locks down capital for a ridiculous dividend.

I had a long position below 120, since last year. It has been trading sideways for months and As soon as I saw it breaking 135 I sold, no regrets."

03/28/2021,stocks,Truth ! I’ve done all of those and I’m pretty happy with my investing.  I do think the falling knife should be slowed  or stopped but not necessarily going up.
03/28/2021,stocks,People are hyperfocused on ATHs but don’t realize it’s the *rate* of increase that matters more. If a stock goes up steadily over time it’s a sign of sustainable growth and should be a safe investment even at ATHs. If it shot up 50% in a short time it’s not sustainable and you should expect a pullback.
03/28/2021,stocks,"People are constantly saying don't buy because stocks are at ATHs. Thing is, every year stock will always be at ATHs.. sooo?"
03/28/2021,stocks,"exactly. ATH is a psychological barrier for risk averse people. If a stock is increasing (especially indices as you point out), there will always be ATHs. Let's not forget that at some point, Amazon had an ATH of like $20 a share. Imagine saying ""sorry, can't buy right now, it's at an ATH""? You'd be missing out on something that grew 150x."

03/28/2021,stocks,"Exactly. New traders which seems the majority here now (just look at the profile when they joined) were told many times:

- Valuations will matter again but they don't care
- don't chase stocks but they don't care
- don't just jump on the reddit hype train and due some basic research but they just don't care
- expectations are insane. Stock doesn't double in 1 month its just not worth it

I said it before and I say it again most of the new people here have absolutely no clue how to valuate stocks and just want that other people tell them what stocks to buy. They just live in their 1 year bubble and mostly only experienced one of the greatest bull market in history.

They run up PLTR to $40 that would give it a forward P/S of 40 which is insanely high and can only be justified in a market where valuation doesn't matter. Even now at this price a forward P/S of +20 is very high considering their estimated revenue for 2021/2022

Same with BB and so many other stocks that are hyped here to no end.

Don't get me wrong when they first pushed PLTR it actually had a decent valuation but that was around $12.50

Another problem is that many new traders don't even understand the most simple stock terms. They still don't even understand marketcap and just think a $1 is cheap and a $100 is expensive while it actually can be the exact opposite.

My feeling is that a lot of newbies will just disappear as long as they just buy random stocks that reddit or youtube etc tells them to buy and are mainly just hype stocks"

And now that 21 years, not 13, have passed, where are the those people now profit wise? If they cashed out and just kept the cash, they'd be worse off today despite not needing to wait 13 years.

03/28/2021,stocks,">	You don't know that you're wrong though

Yeah, just like you don’t know if you are right. The one sure thing you know, is that you don’t know for sure.
So you should always think of downside potential, not only upside.

>	Is tesla, amazon, microsoft, apple, ibm not gonna go up in 5/10/20 years? Hell, one of them might go under, but probably not all of them.

“5/10/20 years” is not a timeframe. Pick one. You got a life to live, and there is a huge difference between 5 and 20 years if you have plans for the money invested.
If I make a bad investment, telling myself it will probably be ok when I’m 10 years older is of no consolation.

But again, the great problem is that we don’t know the future and don’t even fully understand the present.
An example, focused on the shorter end of your timeframe:
There is a theory that the rise of some of the most capitalized stocks was in part fueled by the increasing trend of passive investing. As lots of money got funneled in index funds, they had to buy more of the biggest companies, which led them to become ever bigger in a self reinforcing cicle.
What happens if index funds lose favor, for example to the advantage of thematic stock pickers like ARK?

When we look at 10~20 years, the risks are even greater IMO.
Remember, Exxon was the biggest company in the world. Nokia and BlackBerry were industry leaders. Yahoo was the face of internet search, and MySpace the social network. Sega used to be a big player in home consoles. Sony Walkman had similar brand recognition as the iPod later and iPhone.

That’s why I feel that active stock picking with a very long time horizon is more dangerous, not less. We have no idea what will happen in 5 years, much less in 20!
There is zero guarantee that anyone who is great today will still be relevant after so long. Long time brand names and market leaders fade, new ones are born.

Think about it, in 20 years many of these products will be bought by people who aren’t even born yet! How can you know what they will like and choose?
Look at Facebook. The new generation doesn’t like it as much as the previous, favoring the likes of Instagram. Stuff that you find amazing, it may be old people’s crap in yet unborn eyes.

At the end, valutations matter, because they tend to limit your downside."
03/28/2021,stocks,"That depends entirely. Some dips can be predicted, as in the stock will recover from it. There's also a lot  patterns can tell us. The classic 15 minute into open dip is a pretty presictable dip too if the stock is otherwise solid."

If a high volatile stock like CMPS jumps up 25% in 3 weeks with seemingly no catalyst I’ll sell all of my shares and look to get in when it dips again. I like the company but I’m obviously not nearly as confident in it as something like Apple.

If BB jumps from $10 to $15 in 3-4 months I’ll either sell off a little or keep it depending on why it jumped in price.

If you’re an investor that kept buying dips and bought everyday, that’s months worth of dips you’re buying with no end in sight. 

Hindsight is 2020, but psychologically it was painful to watch every purchase go down and down and down. Yeah it worked out but the covid dip could have lasted years. We got lucky and it only lasted 6-9 months. But the reality of the situation is, it could have been a lot worse. 

So the economy is in the tank and you’re putting all disposable income into dip buying. At some point fear does set in and you start wondering if that amount isn’t better off in cash reserves."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Yeah, but predicting significant dips, like covid, is a COMPLETELY different game. There were no pandemic patterns to follow, it was completely unpredictable."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Yeah, but without knowing what’s happening in the future, we could be at the very beginning of a dip. We could be at the very bottom. There’s no way of knowing."
03/28/2021,stocks,"He's referring to selling options, which is generally much less risky. If you sell a put and are ok with buying 100 shares at the strike, that's not really an added risk. Likewise, if you own shares and sell a covered call, your only risk is losing the shares above the strike, but if you are ok with that level of profit, it's a pretty attractive risk.

A lot of people sell options to act as a dividend. It takes effort to time it well, but the way most people sell options, it decreases the downside risk of the underlying shares."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Same here, it's a micro-manage variation on long term investments. Buy asap, because time in the market beats timing the market, but when buying only grab what's 'on sale' at that moment (and is in your pre-vetted 'I should buy this' list)"

03/28/2021,stocks,"People don't understand the mindset people had in late '00s. No one wanted to touch stocks.

In hindsight it was one of the best times to buy in. Now its the opposite, people are afraid not to be in the stock market.

03/28/2021,stocks,"You make a fair point and I’ve upvoted. 

You mentioned S&P500 (ETF) so yes, I’d plan to keep buying the dip. Like I said the average would keep coming down, and with dividends it would be like a glorified savings account with a massive (potential) upside.

But my answer would be different if we’re talking about individual companies because yes I’d be shitting bricks. Even if something as strong as Apple remains in a very very long slump, I’d definitely start questioning my own conviction on the stock and be thinking “is this the new Enron!?”"

There was good evidence that a) the virus was airborne b) easily transmittable c) more serious than the flu and d) USA response would be ""fat"" and ""sad"".

AND THEN you're saying ""buy the dip"" would be done repeatedly, over months. A dip is a short-term variance, and several months of similar behavior is called a trend or a pattern. 

Anyone who sees that much of a pattern and doesn't re-evaluate vs yesterday or last week's thinking isn't someone we should spend time thinking or caring about. That behavior isn't investing, and it's not even smart trading. It sounds like compulsive gambling.

If someone sank their liquid value, all the way to the hilt, in meme stocks, quick recovery plays, or trading then they've chosen to risk all that money. If someone saw solid, good stocks going down, and bought on the way down, they're probably good already. And, let's be clear, if you're investing, it's too early to be needing your profits.

I don't claim my way is better than yours. If you don't believe buying at dip is not a good thing, then don't buy at dips. I earned much more money through long-term stock holding than what I could have earned through my full-time job. I'm satisfied with it. I'm not that familiar with meme that much other than GME meme.

So, I just look at the current price and compare with my initial cost. If its dropped like $5~10 (I'm very happy with 10+) then I buy it. If I don't have disposable income at my bank account, then I feel like I'm missing the chance but I let it go. I used to be one of guys who just put their income straight into savings account. When I learned about inflation and investment. I realized I lost lots of money for so long. So, I started investing and its been great so far. When I meant dip, I meant the drop of price of share compare to your initial cost. I'm not a day trader and I don't do options. I'm not an expert either. So, I don't claim my method to be right.

I was under the impression a wash sale was selling for a loss say buying at 10 selling at 9 and then buying at 8?

One was a transferred stock. Cost basis never transferred so I enter the exact purchase history on the stock and it shows the correct info under tax lots. But the cost basis on my postion page and total gain/ loss is way off. A doller plus higher per share. Figured no big deal I know the correct amount 
Then same as OP. bought a few shares sold half at a profit and never bought more. Shows it as a wash sale some how and my average price is up $2 per share. I think I’m gonna call them soon and figure it out. 
But maybe not if they gonna report it as a loss if I sell below they’re ave price. Maybe  I’ll take the tax loss"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Do other brokers keep track of wash sales?  And do they give a warning when you buy back a stock that was sold for a gain (not a loss)?  Because I'm thinking about buying the same stock again, and if I sold it at a gain, then I don't want to wait 30+1 days."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Prior to purchasing this stock at $10, did you have any other transactions with the stock? a wash sale is 30 days before or after a sale for loss. 

in other words, had you previously owned this stock at a price higher than $12?

That is the only thing I can think of, otherwise, this does not appear to be appropriately flagged as a wash sale."
03/28/2021,stocks,No cost basis is now higher than what is should be
03/28/2021,stocks,You find out when taxes are do normally.
03/28/2021,stocks,I had bought and sold it before but never for a loss
03/28/2021,stocks,"Well that sounds great! You might not have to pay tax on your first gain since it is tagged as a wash, and now your higher cost basis will give you less to be taxed from when you sell again."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Okay this is happening for me, too.

I had ETFM at .0080, sold at .0150 and bought again at .0083 and it has my cost basis all jacked up and says it’s a wash sale.

Fidelity as well."
03/28/2021,stocks,A bug in an app does not mean you don't have to pay taxes

You're in a period of life where you're highly engaged in a subject and you're enjoying it, for whatever reason. My partner encouraged me to absorb as much as possible why we were locked in.

That chapter ends eventually, when you ""figure it out"". For me it was picking a few stocks and rolling heavy into them with confidence. But finding that confidence took an enormous amount of time to settle.


These days, I write on the weekends on those subjects to encourage others to learn. Because despite not having obsessive learner energy anymore, I still enjoy economics and applying my experiences to a market understanding.


Be proud of yourself. Learning this stuff is often a generational change of which you are a part of."

So I think it depends a bit on which stocks you are holding. Daytrading is exciting but also seems to be way more addicting than longtime investing and also surely is more likely to make you lose your money."
03/28/2021,stocks,Well I always find it nice to know that warren buffett has 100b and doesn't check his stocks everyday why should u
03/28/2021,stocks,"Dang, so much hate on here.
OP, don’t listen to the haters.  Yes, I’d say you need to make some adjustments, but I think your head’s screwed on mostly right.
Force yourself to either get out of such volatile stocks (maybe consider ETFs, or less volatile, dividend paying stocks?), or force yourself to only check the shares at certain periods throughout the day/week/whatever.
Most stocks will rise and fall.  That movement shouldn’t mean anything to you.  Provided you’re in it for the long haul, you buy good companies that will grow and whose shares will increase in value.  It doesn’t matter if it’s up/down tomorrow unless you’re planning to sell them.
If, on the other hand, you are day trading and flip-flopping, then I have to agree with others on here and would suggest that this is too close to a gambling addiction.
If you want to have a little more control over your future net worth, take some time to create a budget and plan your spending so that you can add some savings to your portfolio every couple weeks.  Long term, that will help significantly.
All that said, remember that there are some very old men in this world who would trade their life’s fortune to be in your position right now.  Appreciate what you have and who you have, and spend equal time working on those relationships as well.  Money provides lots of freedom but it’s not as special if you don’t have anyone to appreciate it with."

funny side note, i shit you not the free stock i got when i signed up forever ago was gamestop. unfortunately i sold it way back when"

03/28/2021,stocks,"Sure, robinhood is insured but you're missing out on what bigger brokers can offer. Honestly, $600 is so small right now there isn't much point in transferring that portfolio. I'd say just open accounts at a few other brokers and ee which you like"
03/28/2021,stocks,"I just double checked, fidelity doesn't cost anything to transfer your shares out. That's one thing that makes a large broker better than robinhood. Robinhood wants money just to transfer your shares"
03/28/2021,stocks,"If you want to hold both of those long term then I can almost guarantee that you will not miss out on $75 profit on a principal of $600 (in regards to those two holdings) if you pull out, cancel your account with robinhood and then open up an account with a real, legit broker such as fidelity. If you are truly in the long run and look at history, the US market will always perceiver, therefore you will not miss out on much at all within the few days it takes to settle and be replaced"
03/28/2021,stocks,"It usually is very costly to transfer positions. If your invested amount is 600$ it would, mostly likely, be cheaper to sell it all, transfer money, and rebuy it... in fact in many cases this might be the better choice.."

# What does this company do?

3 main businesses: 

&#x200B;

**Automotive Financing Facilitation: (Clear market leader (see \* below) )**

* Helps car buyers complete car purchase procedures more efficiently and provides loan solutions.   
 
* Cango goes to the car dealers to explain content and terms of the car loan while providing assistance to the customers by completing online application and subsequent landing services.

&#x200B;

**Automotive Transaction Facilitation : (No Competitors in addressable market as per IR team)**

* Connects auto producers, individual consumers, and offline physical network channels through transaction service platform.
* Helps make automobile circulation simpler and more efficient. Cooperates with mature logistic infrastructure service providers, whose parking space are rented on a variable cost basis.
* Helps car dealers increase turnover rates, and improve logistics and warehousing financial services.

&#x200B;

**After-hours services facilitation** 

* Covers diversified insurance such as auto insurance, non-auto insurance and health insurance. It dedicates personnel to provide follow-up to guarantee professional services. 

\* I have been in constant contact with their IR team and since it was hard finding data online on their competitors in China, they said there is only one directly comparable competitor (Yixin Group (2858.HK) ). But, better profitability in Cango’s business, and it operates its own sales team while Yixin relies on third party agents. (more on this later)

&#x200B;

Mission: Work with car buyers to make car buying simple and pleasant. 

Vision: Become the preferred car buying service platform for consumers. 

&#x200B;

# Key Facts and Figures

1. Autofinancing solutions covering **ALL TESLA STORES** in Shanghai. 
2. Strategic Investment in **Li Auto** with **2.2%** equity interest. They invested in Li Auto pre IPO and this has netted them **$3.3 billion** since then, a considerable cash influx to strengthen their already formidable financial position. 
3. Strategic Partnerships with Li Auto, Weltmeister Motor, Aion, 
4. Strategic Partnerships with China's **biggest bank (ICBC)** and 13 other financial institutions. 
5. Backed by Tencent, Warburg Partners
6. Partnerships with 48,000 dealers
7. Have assisted 1,700,000 + car buyers.
8. Partnered with other 36+ industry participants.

&#x200B;

If you are betting on the electric vehicle industry to grow over the next 5 years, then Cango is well positioned to capitalize on this growth. Without having to invest in one particular auto company that you think will do well, why not **bet on the entire industry**. If Chinese consumers buy more cars, it is likely that there will be more auto financing. Moreover, car dealers will need more logistics solutions and efficiency if they want to get ahead of other car providers. Cango solves both problems without having any direct competitors and a robust financial position (see later). 

&#x200B;

* Cango invested in **Li auto** which has returned $3.3 billion in 2020 after Li’s IPO. Cango is still holding about 19.6 milllion shares which accumulate to a total unrealized value of $568.4 million, whilst the majority has been realized and acts as a bonus to their short-term investment assets.   
 
* They have partnered with ICBC (China’s biggest bank) and 13 other financial institutions for their auto financing business. 

**They are building a technology-based dealership management system to provide multilevel integrated guidance and services for their dealers to cover the entire car transaction process.** 

&#x200B;

# Industry Metrics

1. Cango has maintained market share despite the fallout in car sales due to the Covid pandemic. This is a great sign since 2020 was guided as a “slow year” for Cango but we saw new peaks in financials. (see later) .Car sales volume declined by 6.6 % YOY in 2020, yet Cango's market share stayed put at around 1% of total revenue / total cars sold in China. This is not a metric for their particular industry but for the entire China's car sales. 

2. Cango is the dominant player in the auto financing field. However, this field is yet to plateau. It   
only has a tamed market penetration rate when compared with US’s 80% penetration rate.   
With auto financing as their core revenue driver, it can be safely assumed that this area is yet t

expanding and maintain resilience in the market. With its key partners, it won’t be a stretch to   
assume this can be achieved.

# Why would a consumer choose Cango instead of just buying loans directly from banks? 

Cango removes bureaucracy and increases efficiency. This graphic speaks a lot in terms of consumers’ search for ease-of-use technology.

# Why you shouldn’t worry about investing in a Chinese company.

But, investing in China comes with an awful lot of caution for investors, with government regulations that are often disclosed without warnings, resulting in overnight losses in value. However, Cango is structured in a way that takes advantage of government policy. Governments in China want to transform the automotive industry by removing pollution, yet Cango only deals in cars and doesn’t produce them. Moreover, the recent crackdown of Alibaba and Alipay exemplifies the loyalty the government places in state banks. Cango has only partnered with state banks. 



# Awards and Recognition 



1. For the third year in a row, Cango was awarded the **Best Auto Finance Service** 

2. Cango Ranks among “2020 China’s Top 10 Innovators in Auto Marketplaces, Platforms and Services” 

3. Cango was awarded the Innovative Auto Finance Service Enterprises award by China

\- Blowout year, 43% increase in revenue. Both core businesses have accelerated even though this sector is cyclical and was hit due to Covid.  

\- Important thing to note is that in q4 50% of their revenue came from car trading transactions which is a drastic change since auto financing was their core revenue driver. The good thing about this is that it shows they are expanding outside of auto financing since auto financing revenues did not decline. However, we have to note that this business has lower margins, is fairly new and yet to be completely integrated. After emailing their Investor Relations team, the conversation transcribed as follows: 

Me: Thank you for your informative email, I really appreciate it. Everything is clear for me now but I have one final thing to clarify: Your network of offline dealers interact with each other through Cango and ""trade"" cars while inventory is stored at warehouses which are rented on a variable cost basis. This helps car dealers be more efficient and solve logistics problem while Cango receives commissions on this car trading business. Am I right to think along these lines? 

IR Rep: Your understanding is correct.  
 Just to be clear, our car trading business is in the early stage, the business model is that we generate the demand from our dealers, then we place orders with OEMs. We just earn the spread, not commission. The gross profit margin of car trading business is around 1% now. When we reach a certain business scale, we will optimize the profitbility and will make the model lighter by increasing the proportion of facilitation(no inventory), at that time, we can earn commissions from both dealers and OEMs side. 

\- Though Cost of revenue has increased, the cost of revenues as a percentage of relevant revenues was the same as before, cost increased to the boom in their car transaction business. 

\- They got a $3.3 billion cash influx from their investment in Li Auto which is such a bonus to their already strong balance sheet performance. 

Current Price = $8.43

P/E = 1.2 (criminally undervalued, they just announced a crazy special dividend of $1 per share)

Dividend Yield = 12.5%

Book Value = $17

Price / Book = 0.5

Price / Cash = 1.65 

Quick Ratio = 3.6 (wtf)

Current Ratio = 3.6

Debt / Equity = 0.3

Long Term Debt / Equity = 0.12 

EPS Q/Q = 1386.50%

Sales Q/Q = 173.80%

Institutional Ownership = 30.80%

ROA = 34.10%

ROE = 51.70%

Gross Margin = 46%

Operating Margin = 15.50%

Short Float = 2.25%

These numbers speak for themselves. It doesn't take an accountant to realise how undervalued this company is. If you want an in depth analysis of their balance sheet and income statement, message me because r/stocks is really annoying photos.

# Price Target

I have tried to assess their fair value and revenue prediction to create a simplified future cash flow analysis of a conservative price target (assuming 15% growth in revenue and increases in costs) and a bullish price target (assuming 20-40% growth). You can find both if you message me. But from my very simplified calculation the price should be anywhere from **$16-$30.** 

&#x200B;

TLDR: 

Cango is a company that captures the behind the scenes of the entire Chinese auto market. They are the leaderrs in providing auto financing solutions and auto trading transactions. They are criminally undervalued trading at a P/E ratio of 2. They have grown EPS and net revenue every year at 40% growth. They also got a massive influx from investing in Li Auto which netted them $3.3 billion in profit. They are the top solutions partners for Tesla stores in China, VM motors and Aion and have a registered network of 48,000 car dealers. They are also on the right side of government policy since they have partnered up with the biggest bank in China and 13 other financial institutions which are state-run. 

Overall, If you are betting on the electric vehicle industry to grow over the next 5 years, then Cango is well positioned to capitalize on this growth. Without having to invest in one particular auto company that you think will do well, why not **bet on the entire industry**.

&#x200B;

Positions: 500 shares at $9.2.

03/28/2021,stocks,"Very very fantastic DD. I will keep an eye on this, but Chinese stocks are taking a beating because of their lack of transparency."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Great DD! Thanks for your efforts. You state dividend yield 12.5% but I checked couple of websites and it shows around 2.88%. Also the market cap should be around $1.2B, please check. 

The other question I have is regarding ""Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act"" that SEC just adopted.  The measure would kick foreign companies off American stock exchanges if  they fail to comply with U.S. auditing standards for three years in a  row. The rules also require firms prove to the SEC they are not owned or  controlled by an entity of a foreign government and to name any board  members who are Chinese Communist Party officials.  The measure was  signed into law by then-President Trump in December, before it was  evident how the Biden administration would handle relations with  Beijing. 

Will this affect CANG share price in the short term?

Again, thanks for the DD, really appreciate it!"

2021-03-28 09:17:19,stocks,"PFSI is way more undervalued than UWMC and other pureplay mortgage competitors **First, a summary:**

PFSI is significantly undervalued when comparing to competitors. They have a 1.04 P/S, 1.38 P/B, 10% of cap in cash, buying back 15% of float. If you think UWMC is undervalued then you'll love PFSI, and I think PFSI is undervalued by at least 50% compared to other pureplay mortgage companies.

I tried to post this in WSB but of course the apes don't actually read the post and just downvotes since they are down in UWMC. Wanted to see if the more rational investors here have any thoughts and comments.

***Just a note: UWMC and RKT still have good potential for short term speculative plays since their short interests are high. This post is only talking about mid to long term valuations among large traditional mortgage companies. I think the valuations of RKT, TREE, LDI, etc are different since they have a different business model with online lending.***

**Introduction:**

With the recent feud between RKT and UWMC, I decided to take a closer look at a few other companies in the mortgage sector. I was surprised to find that PFSI was at such a low valuation compared to competitors. PennyMac Financial Services (PFSI) is a company that does mortgage origination and investment management services. They were founded in 2008 at the heels of the mortgage financial crisis and they are based in Westlake Village, CA. Currently, they are the 3rd largest mortgage lender. They operate in both the direct-to-consumer channel and the broker channel.

**Financials:**

PFSI has a market cap of $4.73B on sales of $4.56B, and a net income of $1.65B in 2020. They also have $3.4B of equity, including $500m cash, at the end of 2020 (see their [10-K](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001745916/ef9f38e8-9bdd-48a2-9a09-3cc22e4832ac.pdf)). This means that if they make $1.3B profit in 2021, it's P/B will go below 1 for the current stock price. Book values for mortgage companies are generally pretty accurate because there aren't a lot of physical assets that are difficult to value. $1.3B is a 21% downside to their 2021 earning numbers, and I think it will be pretty likely they make this much since the housing market is still hot. The consensus EPS forecast for 2021 is $19/share, and with 71.77m shares outstanding, that would already be $1.36B earnings. Usually for sectors like mortgage, the outlook and forecast are pretty conservative as well.

**Stock buyback:**

PFSI recently approved an increase of their buyback program from $500m to $1B, $350m of which is already used before end of 2020. This means that they are going to buy back another \~15% of the company at current valuations.

**Comparison to competitors:**

*P/E:*

PFSI (3.09); UWMC (n/a); WD (13.6); ESN (11.45); COOP (11.27); HTGC (8.01)

*Forward (P/E):*

PFSI (5.45); UWMC (6.15); WD (11.82); ESNT (7.39); COOP (6.93); HTGC (11.34)

*P/S:*

PFSI (1.04); UWMC (3.59); WD (3.21); ESNT (5.35); COOP (1.1); HTGC (6.47)

*P/B:*

PFSI (1.38); UWMC (2.6\*); WD (2.68); ESNT (1.29); COOP (1.25); HTGC (1.42)

\*using equity numbers from UWMC's 10-K, the public numbers are wrong because of UWMC IPOed with a merger.

Here I've only compared a few larger cap traditional mortgage companies. I excluded companies like RKT, LDI, TREE, etc because they have different business models with online lending and I think their valuations cannot be compared with these traditional mortgage companies.

**Risks of housing market downturn:**

The major headwind to mortgage companies right now is the prospect of rising interest rates and a housing market downturn. However, we know that JPow said the Fed interest won't move until at least after 2023. The mortgage interest rate may creep up a bit but won't go up wildly for next few years. This means that the risk to mortgage companies is not substantial. The lower EPS is already included in the forecast. Furthermore, these few biggest mortgage companies are still gaining market share from the big banks in the mortgage sector, and I would expect this to offset the loss in overall business somewhat.

Positions: bought 150 PFSI shares to start. I'm also holding RKT shares and leaps for its growth potential and squeeze potential (see my past DDs on RKT: [RKT's Road to S&P 500](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m835pq/rkts_road_to_sp500/), [why RKT is not a mortgage company with an app](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8olrf/why_rkt_is_not_just_a_mortgage_company_with_an_app/), [Catalyst for continued housing boom this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8tg5w/rkt_catalysts_for_continued_housing_boom_this_year/), [RKT's growth story shows up in its financials](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/macryp/rkts_growth_story_shows_up_in_its_financials/))"

2021-03-28 09:09:51,stocks,"Hedge funds shorting ETF's containing GME: if GME squeezes, hedge funds will pull out of the entire market leaving retail bag holding? I find it quite concerning that if there is any possibility of the title being true, then why is everyone still parroting stuff like ""bond yields"" and ""sector rotation"" ? There was truth to it in the beginning, but now the markets are continuing to fall and it doesn't make sense anymore. Seems a little too convenient that the markets were pulling in all time highs due to confidence about the US's recovery from the pandemic, GME was getting ready for a 2nd run, then out of nowhere big money starts pulling out, and handing everyone this neat and tidy narrative about bonds while continuing to pull out.

Could the 2008 financial crisis repeat, this time with ETF's?

To be clear, I have no idea if GME will really squeeze in the end. Maybe hedge funds can just stall and buy time for decades until people eventually move on from GME. Or maybe time is running out and 2021 will be known as another financial disaster in our future's history books.

I have no idea. Can most of us that have no idea just step up and admit that we don't know?

Thoughts?"
03/28/2021,stocks,"The bond market showed signs that interest rates needed to go up to counter inflation. The fed has been pumping trillions in liquidity into the system, and has indicated they won't stop unless we reach full employment or inflation gets too high.

Since there were signs of inflation, there was fear the fed would reign things in, and that fear was being priced in.

Could GME be another reason? Maybe. It's possible. However, even at $10,000 per share (likely an insane price even as a brief peak during a short squeeze), it would take $350B to close all short positions. And there's no way all the short positions close at a price that high. The fed's ""we swear this isn't actually QE"" economic policy injects far more than that."
03/28/2021,stocks,Buying opportunity coming?
03/28/2021,stocks,"Bond yields shot up fast. It’s not a fiction it’s a fact. Bond market is insanely large compared to the equities market and generally considered smarter than the stock market. Rising bond yields are not really the major concern, it’s the rate of change that has investors spooked. Also the dollar is rising, despite unlimited printing. Doesn’t seem rational. Oil and cotton dropped 10% - 15% over the past few weeks. Precious metals are flat.

The markets don’t like uncertainty and the markets especially don’t like dislocations and uncertainty at the same time. The rotation into value / defense makes perfect sense. IWM / QQQ are clearly not leading. It’s DOW and SPX pushing higher now. It has nothing to do with GME which is a very small fish in the overall economic ocean."
03/28/2021,stocks,"So which ETF does contain to a big percentage GME?

I couldn't find any ETF which has a meaningful impact on GME? The biggest ETF is iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF where GME is 0.29% of the total.

There are some other where GME has 3-4% of the total, but the total fund size of these is just way too low to even have any impact.

From my view shorting ETF's for GME is just bullshit."
03/28/2021,stocks,Why do people keep talking about GME 'really' squeezing when it already freaking did?
03/28/2021,stocks,I think the bond market was a legitimate reason for a sell-off. But it doesn't make sense for the markets to still be falling. It really seems like there's some market manipulation going on

You should also write something about China being their main customer of iron ore and how this makes them overexposed to China."
03/28/2021,stocks," Fortescue Metals may have been on the rise throughout the past few years due to the increasing demand of iron ore from international markets like China, however they may be a point where China believes that they can import iron ore from other countries and regions, such as Brazil and certain African countries, despite reports taken into these deposits that they have lower overall iron ore quality, however China may be reluctant to import from Australia as relations slow down and may settle for lower quality in order to avoid any chances of Australian tariffs if any are placed as well as they might believe that they don’t need as much steel production for infrastructure, which would kill Fortescue’s biggest market off. FMG would have to look at alternative countries and demographics, which they have looked into South American countries to extract iron ore from and export iron ore as well.

2021-03-28 08:50:32,stocks,"Old school stock investors vs this new age. Sincerely I don't even know how to ask this question but hopefully it will be understood. How confident and enjoyable do LT stock investors in let's say just 10 years ago feel about investing today? There are many new companies/stocks today with promising futures.  However, they are still in their infancy stage with pricing which make them more affordable to be tampered with volume wise. Tampered by today's technology, algorithms, Social Media, HFs, shorters (etc).... all manipulating and compromising true S/P not allowing organic growth with real value based on all technicals you would normally use. For new investors such as I, not only do I feel LT investing is a gamble, but there is an incredible amount of shadiness. Back to my examples in manipulating above. 

I truly feel I have picked very good LT plays but what I've seen is so blatantly bizarre happening in the stock market, that it has me very skeptic.  Organic growth feels almost 1 in a million to achieve. 

Again, question is for the old timers. Just feels safer to invest in more expensive and established blue chips than to invest in potential future diamonds.  Again, I hope this question was understood because even the question felt so difficult that I'm sure I rambled."
03/28/2021,stocks,"The fundamentals of investing never change. I recently read a book from 1688 (the confusion of confusions; an author describes the goings-on at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange back then) and it was just like today. Only there are people in every generation who think they know how it works now, and try to justify their investments with ""this time it's different"". The basics never change, and interestingly, value has been doing better than tech for hundreds of years (with prominent exceptions). Don't get confused or think that the basics are changing. You can still read books by Graham or Buffet today and still perform well."
03/28/2021,stocks,"The market hasn’t changed.

There were tech runners 50 years ago. There is a lot more noise and hype now via social media tho, especially after the past year, ten years of bull market. There are also a lot of new exciting companies that won’t exist selling shares now. It’s much more of a gamble buying shares of individual companies than index investing. The SPX represents the strongest companies in the country. If a company gets BTFO, they get dropped off the SPX and the next best one is added. Survival of the fittest so to speak."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I think the market, that is the conglomerate of ""retail"" individuals and ""institutional"" investors, is still the very same to the core. But now augmented by much more technology.

Algorithm Trading, HF Trading and the like are way more accessible to the ""institutional"" part of the market - that's the perceived ""edge"" they have. I hope this will change soon as smart individuals are hopefully working on smart invest AIs across the globe for people to have access to these trading algos on an everyday basis if they choose to.

What always existed, to my very limited knowledge, is:

\- *Informed Professionals* who are closer to some information or closer ""to the market"", aka Traders sitting at Market Makers, Analysts with direct lines and more real time access who can execute a trade in seconds, not minutes.

As an analogy to the very far past: think back to the roaring 1920s. Stock trading was a fad. However, ""Telegraphs"" delayed the ticker values by several minutes even outside the stock exchange where actual trading was executed. Today you sit at a Bloomberg terminal or your brokerage account and push a button almost in real time to buy at a certain price. The people sitting at trading desks have more direct access. This has changed vastly though as you can also get ""Level 2"" data nowadays as an individual investor. The gap is closing.

\- *Dark Pools* in one or the other way

\- *""Behind Closed Doors"" trading* (related to the above) by direct deal making. Think big instituational money lenders and the acquisition of direct Warrants, exchangable to shares under certain conditions.

\- *Whale Investors* who can influence and play the system as they know more than the individual investor (not sure that is still true in terms of knowledge, but certainly in access to analysis with more data or professionalism) or they simply have more weight on share prices when they decide to move

The ""Short Game"" has been literally played since ages ago, you can read up all about it in literature.

The long game, however has never changed and proven by Grantham and Buffet to be a very, if not *the* most successful way to be ""in the game"".

Now, how you place investments is for you to decide.

The simple way is to ""set and forget"" your bets in solid companies that you believe will further your investment and grow their value by doing the right moves, investing in the right technology and people to grow their overall business and build technological moats around them to gain an edge long term.

So if your time horizon for investing is set to 15-30 years, the long game is what wins you money.

If you're in the short, volatility, swing trading game, prepare to be rattled and stressed by your investing decisions, as this is a full-time job.

One most people actually can't do because, you know, they have a real life job that is not ""Analyst"" or ""Investment Banker""."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I remember being on the trading floor 10-15 years ago, and the older guys saying back then that the market doesn't make sense anymore. Technology is always advancing trading possibilities, and there are always going to be really smart people out there who think way outside the box.

As far as specific stocks, I've always said one of the hardest things about stock trading is knowing what stocks are out there. I let the indexes sort out what stocks have legs from those that don't. The nasdaq 100 is the top tech index, those are your solid blue chips. 100 stocks isn't too difficult to keep track of. One obv drawback to following an index is yeah, you might miss a new ipo that 🚀 but once you are used to watching a list, reading the news about upcoming releases makes sorting through easier. 

Trading & investing will always be there and will always be subject to advancing technology. Algos will probably be more available for individual investors in 10yrs and things that I can't imagine will be out there as well. 

If you stick to blue chips you certainly won't regret it. Let the index makers do their thing and they will help you sift through all the thousands of stocks. When aapl stops being a good investment, well, that's a scarry thought."

If you go back far enough you can see corollaries to today.

I think the reason why you're confused is that you don't really understand your investments. Given what I read, it seems you haven't done enough analysis on different companies and your ""plays.""

The shadiness you see is just speculation. There have always been people trying to get one over on others. There have always been DeLUIsiOnAL people who try to convince others. And there always has been crowds pushing up bubbles.

The question isn't one between blue chips and potential future diamonds (whatever that means). The question is what a particular company is worth, whether the price you can pay is lower than what its worth, and the size of the cushion in the case something unexpected happens. As Warren Buffett says, the market is a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in the long term.

2021-03-28 08:50:09,stocks,"Volkswagen's other play: synthetic fuel (VOW, VWAGY) While Volkswagen is aiming to become the consumer EV market leader by 2025 and possibly as early as next year (read: become the Next Tesla), it isn't abandoning the usual ICE markets to the likes of laggards Toyota and Suzuki:

[Porsche to produce fuel 'as clean' as electric vehicles](https://www.dw.com/en/porsche-to-produce-fuel-as-clean-as-electric-vehicles/a-56787413)

> Enter electrofuels or eFuels as Porsche calls it — synthetic methanol gasoline that will be produced using green hydrogen, made with renewable energy. The fuel will burn the same as gasoline made from crude oil but without the huge greenhouse gas emissions. It can be sold at the existing network of filling stations globally and Porsche owners won't need to get their engines modified.

> Porsche spokesman Peter Gräve told DW its eFuels will ""permit the almost climate-neutral operation of combustion-engine vehicles."" The carmaker recently said its electrofuels could cut CO2 emissions by more than 85% and is cleaner than an electric vehicle when factoring in the environmental impact of battery production.

While the article discusses Porsche out of all Volkswagen brands, the applicability of this synthetic fuel initiative extends to all the other brands.

Even by 2030, there will still be markets where switching to EVs is not feasible, most notably emerging markets whose electrical infrastructure can be easily knocked out by typhoons.

Synthetic fuel could be Volkwagen's ace up its sleeve against the likes of Toyota and Suzuki, or it could just be the next Dieselgate.

*Disclosure: Long VWAGY and POAHY.*"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Yeah this is very interesting, but seems also an awfully long shot.

A few things to think over:

Price remains a concern.

Distribution also. It needs to be adopted by the whole industry or it won’t make it to your fuel station.

Green fuels won’t stop the move to EVs. Electric is just better to drive, easier to care, doesn’t smell and choke you when you are in a trafficked road or big city.

Let’s not forget we already have a kind-of environmental friendly and inexpensive alternative fuel: LPG.
I have a dual fuel LPG car. With it I can go in the city center on days of traffic closure, and at a rough calculation it’s about as expensive to run as EV charged on a public fast chargers. No range anxiety, and the car itself is much cheaper than a EV.
You can also convert many existing cars to use it. Yet you don’t see anyone care much about.

In fact, it probably gets willfully ignored to make the case for EV look more compelling. EV savings on pollution and fuel are shown against petrol and diesel, rather than the better option, LPG.

So eFuels, assuming they see adoption, may become just an option to keep certain old cars usable for longer. Specifically, sport and historic cars, which are unfeasible to convert to LPG because of the need of an additional fuel tank goes against the spirit of preservation. That’s not a huge business.

For most everyone else, the eFuel option exists and is available already, it’s called LPG, and the masses already don’t care because it’s not new and shiny anymore."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I work in public policy in Germany where the debate on electric mobility vs. hydrogen mobility vs. synthetic fuels has been settled for a while now. the long story short is, electric mobility, due to simple physics, has the highest overall energy efficiency, from your solar panels or wind turbines to your wheel. hydrogen is distant second, synthetic fuels are dead last. in fact, you need 4 to 5 times more solar and wind power for the same number of kilometres driven for hydrogen than for direct electric drive. that translates into 4 to 5 times the capex for power production alone, plus capex for the extra conversion step from power to hydrogen (ever heard that electrolysers being expensive? well ...). for synthetic fuels you need *even more* clean power and *another extra* conversion step. no amount of subsidies will make synthetic fuels competitive with battery in our life times. all serious researchers and policy consultants have known this since before the battery prices dropped 90% in the last decade. there’s a reason Tesla is the most valuable carmaker in the world.

You know to whom synthetic fuels make sense? To the carmakers still sticking theit head in the sand and hoping the governments bail them out. although it’s probably not even an honest play at this point anymore and even they know the future is electric, but their c-suite has to make it look like they’re on top of things and earn their golden parachutes. that’s why they need to make it appear like the internal combustion engine has a future in a zero-carbon world. in Germany, you can see how busy the still-world leading carmakers are lobbying for the slowest transition and the most toothless regulations possible. with some success, too. but if the battery prices drop another 50% by 2025 and the upfront cost of an BEV is on paar with an ICE, it won’t even matter anymore. 

sure, synthetic fuels might be how (parts of) air and sea traffic are decarbonised, and renewable hydrogen will be needed in industry. but for road transport, don’t buy the carmaker’s propaganda.

edit: some styling for clarity"

03/28/2021,stocks,"To their credit, in an interview I saw with someone at Porsche, the eFuel was presented as a way to try keeping existing cars on the road for longer, more than an alternative to EV.

I see it largely aimed at cars that have a heritage, preserving the past. Think of car collectors and lovers, at all the existing iconic vehicles from brands like Ferrari and of course Porsche, even some relatively inexpensive ones like the Alfa Romeo Duetto.

Probably they also want to tranquillize the buyers of luxury cars today, that if you spend 100-200k on a new ICE Porsche today it will have a long life ahead.

Anyway, cool cars are being made largely road illegal by the new emission standards, and this affects common people not only collectors.
I have a Mazda MX-5 NB, both a very inexpensive and very cool drive, but it’s emission standard Euro 3, which makes its circulation already illegal in some big cities. It would be a pity to just demolish it, but that’s where we are headed."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Considering your background, yes, VW is moving with the times.

However, like I said in my OP, emerging markets can have their electrical infrastructure knocked out easily, especially by typhoons.

It would be stupid if VW were to abandon them to Toyota and Suzuki just for the sake of EVs.

Speaking of EVs, why is Toyota going with hydrogen fuel cell-powered cars instead of BEVs?"

03/28/2021,stocks,VWAGY if you're North American and VOW if you're European.
03/28/2021,stocks,"I agree. Presently, the environmental damage associated with driving an internal combustion engine car is still largely externalised, but this is changing. For one, CO2-levies on transport fuels are being introduced in many countries. Secondly, emissions standards are getting tighter. This is pricing in the environmental aspects of driving an internal combustion engine (ICEs) car and making it more expensive, and therefore increasingly a luxury. 

I don’t think any government anywhere will ever flat out ban the sale of gasoline and diesel fuel, as the political prive would have been too high. (even though bans on sales of new gasoline and diesel cars have already been imtriduced im some countries, starting in the 2030s.) Rather, the governments will price out the ICEs through a combination of increases capex and opex (see above), plus making electric cars more attractive. 

The end game for the policy makers I think will be to price out the fossil fuels and eliminate their emissions, and replace them with synthetic fuels for the wealthy if they so choose and with electric drives for the masses. So people wanting to enjoy their Porsches and Ferraris will always be able to to that, but not poeple driving Volkswagens, as that will become too expensive per kilometer driven. 

In a somewhat ironic policy twist, the expected EU emmissions standards require such expensive technologies that Renault has decided to discountinue the Twingo model, because small cars have margins that are too thin to accomodate that. That’s different for bigger, more expensive cars that are offen also gas guzzlers. So the trend of ICEs being priced out might have started at the wrong end, but it’s started nevertheless."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Yeah Japan’s carmakers are really tough to understand if you think of them in a way you’d think about western carmakers. In the West, they answer first and foremost to their shareholders. In Japan, the government has much more say in what the companies do and expects them to align their strategy with the nation’s industrial policy. 

Which sees a huge role for hydrogen - and not even carbon neutral hydrogen which is only to come after 2040 or so - in heating, transport and power system. While hydrogen can do all of those things, most of them it doesn’t do very well, so you‘ll end up with a very inefficient energy system across all sectors if hydrogen is the end rather than the means. That translates into an expensive power system with slower decarbonisation rates than you could achieve if you had independent universities and consultants develop comprehensive decarbonisation scenarios rigorously tested for sensitivites, like that‘s the case in the EU or US have (which doesn‘t mean the politicians will always follow the advice, but it‘s at least a start). 

In a sense, you could say hydrogen is almost like religion in Japan. 

But trust me, emerging markets will never drive around on hydrogen, they can‘t finance the infrastructure, vehicles or hydrogen. It‘ll be a mix of electric and good ol‘ oil for a long time."

03/28/2021,stocks,"Yes, actually.

The American system has a mix of private and public bodies with separate, often conflicting, agendas. It relies on private auditors and public regulators with varying degrees of autonomy, power, and decency. There are several places where this system fails and is in need of improvement, and has improved in the past in fits and starts. Therefore the Securities Act of 1933, Sarbanes-Oxley, Dodd-Frank, and a thousand other minor course corrections. It’s not going to be perfect or devoid of corruption or revolving doors, but it adapts and does not play to the tune of a single agenda. It’s a lot like democracy.

The Chinese system, on the other hand, has no notion of autonomous oversight or independent audit whatsoever. Whatever the state wants, will be delivered. An American President who wanted the market to go in a specific direction or data to be misrepresented outright would have to contend with a whole structure of independent people who don't mind following their own interests. The last American President tried a much milder version of that, and got burned for it in all directions. In America, ‘state interest’ directing all things is an anomaly and one the system actively rebels against; in China, it is the system.

It’s fashionable (edgy?) to equate the two systems, especially for Americans who have never encountered a truly authoritarian, monolithic system that has no compunction using violence for its ends on all occasions. They are not."

PACB has made huge strides in lowering the cost of this kind of genomic sequencing. 
I also use it for genome assembly, this is when the genetic material of an organism is sequenced and it's genome is reconstructed from the sequencing data.  Many organisms have the annoying property of having ""repetitive"" sequenced in their genome. PACB technology helps dealing with this kinds of issues.

2021-03-28 06:55:37,stocks,"Could the semi-conductor shortage be bullish for steel producers? Edit: I'm actually looking for *any* non-bullish case for non-chinese steel producers, not just as it relates to semi-conductors. That's just part of my bullish case at the moment.

I'm beginning to think that the semi-conductor shortage could lead a very bullish scenario in the non-chinese steel producer market and I'm wondering if anyone has a reasonable case that non-chinese steel producers will decline or remain flat over the coming year or so. Here is my bull case:

Tensions have been obviously ramping up between China and the Western nations over the last few years and I believe the will be escalating pretty dramatically in the next year. While there is a lot of talk about Uighur and Hong Kong, one of the angles I believe that people are missing is the connection between the semi-conductor shortage and potential serious confrontation between the US and China. Everyone is looking at the semi-conductor play and TSM comes up a lot, but as the saying goes: buy the rumor, sell the news.

The shortage is the news, so what's the rumor?

Well, from what I understand, TSM is incredibly crucial to helping make up the semi-conductor shortfall of western nations, as outlined in [this](https://www.bloomberg.com./news/features/2021-01-25/the-world-is-dangerously-dependent-on-taiwan-for-semiconductors) article. This is very interesting, because it puts Taiwan in a particular position of strength and leverage in dealing with western nations. Why does this matter? For a long time Taiwan has been considered a ""part"" of China per the ""one-China policy"", and the current President stating that she [will never accept ""one country, two systems"".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan). Further, while I know very little about internal Taiwanese politics, it seems that her party, the DPP, holds a very significant portion of the congress and considers an independent Taiwanese identity a core issue of the party. This seems to put the government of Taiwan in a position of great leverage to demand that the United State, Japan, Australia, Europe, etc, recognize Taiwan as a legitimate, independent nation, separate from China, and with a significant amount of leverage to make these demands. Why would Taiwan sell its semi-conductors to the US instead of China if the the US won't even recognize Taiwanese independence? What is the incentive when their products are in demand everywhere? This isn't even a matter of just being able to make iPhones, a lack of semi-conductors could be a serious threat to nation security (I'm not saying it is, I'm saying it's possible it is).

China, on other hand, seems to be very reluctant to give up it's control of Taiwan stating in 2019 that ""If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese military has no choice but to fight at all costs"" (same Wikipedia article). In fact, I think they have already recognized that Taiwan may use this semi-conductor situation to their advantage and are backing up these words with action. It seems that the Chinese military has been being conducting large-scale military exercises in Taiwanese air space, with someone stating that they are [conducting exercises that would simulate an operation against U.S. warships that sail through the Bashi Channel](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwna-china-security/taiwan-reports-largest-ever-incursion-by-chinese-air-force-idUSKBN2BI24D). And the the US already seems to be taking [its own pro-Taiwanese actions](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/us-taiwan-sign-coast-guard-deal-to-counter-china/articleshow/81702961.cms).

Let's add on to this that generally speaking, the language coming out of western governments hasn't exactly been pro-China lately. The US is talking about [sanctioning](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/22/us-allies-sanctions-china-uighers-genocide-477434) China, and Australia is talking about bringing to the WTO over [unfair trade](https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news20_e/ds598rfc_21dec20_e.htm).

At this point you might be thinking, ""ok, this is a great lesson in geo-politics, but what does this all have to do with steel?"". The thing is, Chinese steel has been a very contentious issue for a very long time. China produces roughly half the world's steel, and accounts for about [15% of steel exported globally](https://legacy.trade.gov/steel/countries/pdfs/exports-china.pdf), and there have been constant accusations of China dumping excess steel to suppress global steel prices. If you were paying attention during the Trump administration, this was a central focus of the trade war and the tariffs on China.

If tensions continue to ramp up, I don't see why sanctions wouldn't be an order of business, and I could very much see the US demanding that it's allies boycott Chinese products, with steel at the top of that list. Combine this with the fact steel already as already hitting all-time high prices and that Biden is announcing a 3 trillion dollar infrastructure plan, it seems like we are heading into a situation where we will have a growing demand for steel and high material costs, and a potential boycott of Chinese produced-steel which could be a boon to non-chinese steel producers.

While I have read into this, I haven't read into it *super* deeply, so any commentary is appreciated."
03/28/2021,stocks,"So, let me first say that I am bullish steel and other industrial metals.  
However, the post is asking for a bearish case for steel as it relates to the semiconductor shortage.  To that end, I'll play devil's advocate. the bearish case is that semiconductor supply to domestic automotive supply-chains are tightest.  In fact some U.S. auto assembly plants are being taken off line NOW as a result of the semiconductor chip shortage.  The auto industry is a large consumer of steel.  The chip shortage will artificially stunt U.S. auto production and an important component of domestic steel demand. This reduction in demand will result in a reduction in steel prices.

As for the geopolitical situation (tensions) with China impacting Chinese steel imports, the Section 232 tariffs enacted under Trump and widely supported and reaffirmed by the Biden administration place a 25% tariff on Chinese (among other) steel (& 10% tariffs on aluminum) imports.  This has definitely already curtailed imports, driven prices up and spurred an expansion in U.S. steel making capacity.  

BTW, Taiwan has historically and  consistently considered itself independent from Taiwan.  US has a long history of selling Taiwan arms to protect itself against China and would likely intervene to support Taiwan in the case of an actionable threat.

>Source: I'm an industrial metals trader

Well that definitely adds to the bullish case lol. I'll troll through your post history if its all in there, but I'd be interested in hearing your case for steel and any other industrial metals you're bullish on. I really think the big trades of 2021-2023ish are going to be in food, industrial commodities, and bonds.

I was actually looking for *any* bearish case for non-chinese steel producers to work out whether this is a good trade, but I think you made a really good specific case as it relates to the semi-conductor issues. I remember the Biden administration specifically talking about auto when addressing the semi-conductor crisis so there is a good chance we see a decline in demand for steel due to reduced production due to lack of semi-conductors. Likely, this won't be limited to the US alone, I can imagine that it will affect auto manufacturers internationally. Which begs the question: *if* there is a boycott of Chinese steel, will demand for non-Chinese steel hold?

From what I understand, the largest purchasers of Chinese steel are South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines, who I would think would follow any US/EU boycott to signal their alignment in any potential conflict. I believe South Korea is pretty big on auto (Hyundai and Nissan maybe?), so their demand for steel could potentially tank if the semi shortage continues.

Section 232 is also a good point for American steel manufacturers, also keeping in mind that any infrastructure bill would likely have some sort of ""buy America"" provision. This would definitely be bullish for American steel, but the question is whether we have the capacity.

So I guess that leaves the questions of:

How much will the semi-conductor shortage lower the demand for steel due to auto manufacturing constraints?

Does the US have a large enough productive steel capacity to be the sole supplier of any large-scale infrastructure project?

Who will have the most demand for non-Chinese steel, and where will they buy it? It seems to me that most of the Chinese steel importers are regional (which makes sense due to shipping) so the likely benefactor would also be regional, if there are any. I can't find an article to support this at the moment, but I also seem to remember reading somewhere that India will be suspending steel exports until like June or July, which is also very interesting."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Just wondering, who are the major domestic manufacturers of steel and metals processing equipment?"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Yeah, CLF, X, MT, and NUE are the tickers I see floated around often. I'm just looking for the bear case, because I honestly have seen any one float one yet and it seems just too good to be true as the market has obviously *not* priced this in."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I've read through the Godfathers original set of posts when I found that sub. We came at this same case for steel from totally different angles. His seems to be predicated on the increased cost of raw materials and end product leading to the producers stock to moon over summer, like it did in 2008. While I think this is a good case, I'm not entirely convince. If I remember correctly, prices started to rise in 2005 and it took a full 3 years for producer stocks to moon. I've also read that there was a good deal of manipulation of steel prices back in '08, so you have to wonder how much of the bump in prices was due to that.

His case also relies on demand from China, but I actually don't think that will hold. In absence of a boycott of Chinese steel, falling demand for steel from China will lead to more dumping, which will suppress steel prices and be extremely bad for non-Chinese producers.

I think he is a good source of info, but I'm skeptical of some of his positions on this trade."

03/28/2021,stocks,"The Chinese portion of the play doesn't deal so much with increased demand but with China cutting back their rebate for exports, thus making Chinese steel more expensive for consumers around the world."

03/28/2021,stocks,"Gotcha, this I wasn't aware of so I'll have to look into it more. I kept seeing him talking about demand from China so my assumption is that it just dealt with that. Thanks for the info.

I think I’m gonna look for puts long term"
03/28/2021,stocks,"Exactly. Bearish at current valuation through recovery. 12-18 months. After that I def see sector growing. But Even if sector prices drop 50% Monday I likely wouldn’t buy bc I like my money in other places right mow. I ASSUME I’ll make more $ mid term elsewhere then when time is right buy the sector. Just not now. I do have some lithium, graphite, etc though. Also, something tells me that a few of these won’t survive long term term and I don’t want to be caught bag holding one of the chumps."
03/28/2021,stocks,"That makes sense. It’s hot so it’s booming but the sector will balance itself and the companies that can’t last will be exposed. I feel like charge point is that company. The shares on market is 277M while blink and CCLI is around 40M. It’ll be hard for them to raise capital for the new wave of competition coming and will probably fall in value. Thanks for sharing guys.

It is definitely an interesting company that is young and grew revenues almost triple digits YoY. The bullish case looks at rapidly growing revenues, the societal move away from cable, and Fubo’s integration of a sports/entertainment streaming platform with a massively growing trend of sport betting/gaming. The bearish case looks at concerns over lots of competition in the streaming space and how far away FUBO is from profitability. What are some of your opinions and which side of the argument are you on?"

03/28/2021,stocks,"Until recently I personally subscribed to FUBO TV for the last couple of years. Before that I used Sling and now I use Hulu. What I can tell you is that FUBO is in SERIOUS trouble in the competitive landscape. Its only true edge is sports which is why I switched to it from Sling. Since that time most other streaming services have added more sports channels and while not necessarily on par with Fubo, it is enough for most people. 

Personally switching to Hulu was a breath of fresh air because of the huge amount of additional content available. Looking back, I wish I had switched sooner. Sling is significantly cheaper ($29), Fubo is very expensive by comparison ($79), and Hulu has way more content ($71) while also being cheaper."
03/28/2021,stocks,What about the world cup? Won’t Fubo own a major share of the content?

Then you’re gonna have to kill me and dig up the cemetery because I am taking this stock to the grave.”  If you hold on to your shares, Wall Street can never own them.  This will frustrate them. If enough investors buy and hold a stock because it’s a great company with great growth prospects, then the vampire squid will move on.  Wall Street’s biggest weapon is fear. Fear in the face of an uncertain future.  If you sell, they win.   If you hold, you win.  Don’t let Wall Street steal your gems!"

With more streaming services getting soccer contracts as well as fans being allowed back in stadiums their short term revenue may see a dip, or at the very least climb at a lower rate.  I used to subscribe to fubo for soccer content, I left it because the combination of peacock and sling got me everything I wanted at a cheaper price than fubo on it's own.  Fubo needs to either add content or lower their prices to compete long term."

03/28/2021,stocks,"I think the definition of a meme stock has been blurred a little bit. To me it's when people have no idea what they are doing but ""like the stock"" and are buying based on hype instead of fundamentals.

There are companies that are good buys that have become meme stocks, and adversely there are super crap companies that have become meme stocks.

I saw someone mention AMD as a meme stock just a moment ago. AMD is a long term hold that is already profitable, not exactly a meme stock imo. 

Gamestop is definitely a meme stock. They are at least ten years late to the game and they have paid the price for it. I'd love to see them turn it around, but they are now competing directly with the console manufacturers as well as first movers such as Newegg. 

I wouldn't call BB a meme stock, but definitely a little bit of a gamble on if they can pull off the software turnaround long term. (I have a small allocation to BB).

Sadly Tesla is a meme stock. Great company that will hopefully be around long term, but horrendously overvalued for current metrics. Don't get me started on ARKs thesis on Tesla, it shows a fundamental lack of understanding of how many aspects of the company work (or can work), as well as showing that Cathie has maybe lost touch with reality just a tad. I'd really love to buy in to Tesla but it's just too high of a valuation.

Speculation is dangerous. When you see people saying ""I'm new, BUT... ___ is a no brainer""... kind of a sign that it will end up badly. Understand that a lot of the people pumping meme stocks have not-a-clue what they are doing.

From the beginning, small investors are always dreaming and wishing that some billionaire buys what they are holding....and take that stock up. Before it was only Warren Buffett. Then we saw people like Icahn and Ackman and Soros getting in on public attention. Now it's all kinds of characters! Do you ever stop to seriously wonder if this is the NEW ILLUSION that Wall Street has created to get ""dumb money"" in? Anyway, man....it's your money...you have every right to invest where you want.

2021-03-28 01:44:42,stocks,"Tanker Gang Rise Up; a Repeat of 2020? First, check [https://istheshipstillstuck.com/](https://istheshipstillstuck.com/) and if the answer is ""Yes"" on Monday morning, watch the action on oil tanker stocks.

Last April, oil futures went negative which created the ""Tanker Gang."" Shooting to meme status was one tanker stock, $NAT and the stock ran from under $3/share to $9/share in weeks.

Most longtime tanker investors hate on $NAT because their CEO is a promoter and goes on Cramer. They don't like the fact their Suezmax ships are old and think their book value is overstated due to the age of their ships. Book value doesn't mean much for an operating company that's not in danger of bankruptcy. It's profits, cashflow and ability to service debt that really counts. They're able to keep these old ships running, even using the latest low sulphur fuels and pay most profits earned as dividends. They're basically the slumlords of tankers and if you've ever been involved in real estate, you know those slums cash flow much better than Trump level properties.

Nevertheless, tanker stocks generally suck and tanker gang got burned after oil futures trading returned to normal.

We like short dated options plays on the tanker with the greatest meme power.

Do what you will with this information. This is gambling, not investing and we don't provide financial advice.

&#x200B;

EDIT Monday, March 29, 2021: Looks like the ship is partially refloated. Awaiting for options plays to blow up (and not in a good way). Aren't you glad you waited until Monday morning?"

03/28/2021,stocks,VUZI. The company is doing an offering at 20.50$ atm (that's why the price went down). It's almost guaranteed to go up significantly when they release next gen smart glasses in H2. The CEO is just *the boss* of smartglasses.
03/28/2021,stocks,"Good list!

COST - makes their money from membership activity, not necessarily the merchandise.  The only other large retailer that can compete is Sam's (WMT)

PYPL - Payments can be tricky, their acquisitions have helped.  In addition, the remittance area is pretty strong.  I wouldn't buy, but have plenty from 2015 myself, slowly liquidating (down to about $200,000 currently).  Haven't seen their tech stack in a few years but based upon the pace of change, not seeing them make major strides. 

TGT - Not seeing major tail winds to provide support.  Went with a WMT play last year that didn't pay off.

FB - Hiring but their antics during the 2020 election has me not returning the calls of their recruiter.  Good technological stack though.  In other words, they're not going to pay me enough...

DIS - Got hit hard with COVID, especially with the park being shut down in CA, and then there is the cruise line fiasco that is coming down as well.

HD / LOW - Good plays, typically after a disaster when people are buying up wood and hurricane supplies to rebuild.  Come summer, expect to see generators still being sold as CA shuts down their power grid again.

NFLX - Tough to call.  Had contacts with people who went to work there and they said it's brutal internally.  That of course drives innovation and change as people want to keep their jobs.  However, AMZN and HBO are moving in that direction as well.

NVDA and AMD are chip makers.  I'm also looking out for $500 NVDA but leery about the chip / supply shortage (Suez included) forcing NVDA to release video cards which are hobbled.  Huge backlog for RTX 3080 / 3090 since the release of November.

I do not see anything stopping an AMZN juggernaut in the future.  They're not embroiled in the Section 230 censorship issue, and have broadened into many areas the same way that MSFT has as well.  Not even calls for the break up of them as part of a monopoly discussion as we had with MSFT in the past.

* ~~NFLX~~
* ~~DIS~~
* ~~LOW~~
* ~~AMD~~
* ~~FB~~
* ~~PYPL~~

I saw Cramer cover FROG (since you like tech, you may recognize them) and there are security plays out there as well.  I'd keep an eye out for Snyk, look into Splunk (SPLK) and then Atlassian (TEAM).  Since you may also be familiar with the SF Area, CRM is an option as well.

03/28/2021,stocks,"So I think there’s a couple things goin on. Gas prices are rising and expected to head higher, and while that’s realistically not much of a headwind the market thinks it is. There’s the mileage tax that was mentioned. The cost of all the inputs to make them is rising, raising the overall unit costs. And then there’s the whole “how the fuck do we top last year” element. I personally don’t believe Covid will be as much of a factor this summer/fall, and people don’t usually buy new RVs every year (or even close to it) so I imagine they sold a lot to the people who would’ve bought one last year. No way to match those comps, especially cuz a lot of families who bought one just cuz of Covid will dump them on the resale market this year. 

I think RVs had the best year they’ll have in a while last year. I love RVing, but the number of new people buying/using them was staggering and I personally feel it was unsustainable. What I would do is sell covered calls moderately OTM if I were you. If the shares get called away, I think no harm no foul, you get the premiums either way.

03/28/2021,stocks,It may also be that the Harris admin is planning to implement a mileage tax. I would guess any price drop hasn’t taken that into consideration though. More likely that WGO was already inflated in price short term due to covid buying of RVs.

2021-03-28 00:42:41,stocks,"Is OTC/darkpools trading a giant middle finger to fundamentals? One of those aforementioned fundamentals: 

more buys (demand) than sells (supply) = stock price goes up

Does the the price of stock truly respond to demand and supply? Idk, but it's way too oversimplified. It didn't state WHERE these trades have to take place in order for that fundamental to be applicable.   


While I'm not entirely clear about OTC/darkpools and the percentage of trading activities through performed through them compared to the open market, its existence, lack of transparency and potential for bullshit/exploit somewhat void the fundamentals. It's not entirely ""illegal""; only a few critical ways of using it are I believe. However, if my understanding of it is correct, you can use it to alleviate buy pressures or effectively control (greyishly manipulate) stock prices.

But wth do I know. Someone educate me more I don't wanna sound all paranoid."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Off-exchange trading through ECNs/dark pools certainly influences price and can lead to better prices than the [NBBO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp). This can lead to price improvement which may not be accessible to the usual retail trader, unless he uses a broker with superior routing and execution (and access to ECNs/dark pools) or a good [direct access broker](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/directaccessbroker.asp).

The majority of volume in US markets is generated by algo trading and such trading definitely affects prices artificially in the short term. It is naive to think that the ""demand and supply"" behind the short term prices you see is generated by human traders given that most orders are placed by algorithms which attempt to profit from human trading and to move prices on short time scales. However the effect of algo trading on prices tends to wash out in the long run.

Notice that FINRA provides reporting facilities which record off-exchange trades with certain delays. See:

I would impose other, stricter rules on these, since when used wrongly a Dark Pool will only benefit those with direct access to it as opposed to a ""free market""."
03/28/2021,stocks,"It also benefits retail traders by protecting them from massive crashes when an institutional decides to sell.  

>Supply and demand definitely have an effect on the stock price.

They do but we also need to understand that in most cases there are upper and lower price limits."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Dark pools were created in the interest of institutional investors and not to protect retail investors. Their purpose is to avoid moving the price when making large block trades. Hedge funds are not the only institutions using such trades, the players include pretty much any investor who wants and can afford to pay for access. There are direct access brokers who offer the possibility of sending trades directly to ECNs/dark pools to individual or retail traders."
03/28/2021,stocks,"> But if you think about it, it really benefits ONLY the hedgies. They get to trade under the table for a better price because if they tried buying in bulk on the market it would surge the price up. So they buy wholesale from another hedge fund all at the same price.

03/28/2021,stocks,"In this context ""OTC trading"" refers to any trading that takes place outside of the exchanges (the three major exchanges in the US being NYSE, NASDAQ and AMEX).

03/28/2021,stocks,"There is no doubt that dark pools serve a useful purpose for institutional and other large investors. However, they also tend to distort price discovery in public markets given their traditionally non-transparent nature.

As usual with such things, one has to balance divergent interests, which is the job of government regulators such as the SEC and of industry watchdogs such as FINRA. Up to now, the SEC has been of the opinion that OTC trading through ECNs and dark pools has a net positive effect on the market by increasing competition and liquidity. And FINRA has been making efforts to increase transparency of OTC trading as explained in the links I provided.

In any case retail investors do well to learn about such subjects since it is in their interest to understand the market's structure, functioning and players. Transparency and education  promote market integrity, which is a social and economic positive."
03/28/2021,stocks,"The fact that a company trades through the OTCBB is different from the concept of ""OTC trading"" in general. An OTCBB company trades OTC but companies listed on exchanges (say on the NYSE or NASDAQ) can also ""trade OTC"", say though ECNs/dark pools.

03/28/2021,stocks,"Here is my general [advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/lyp347/Hey_newbie_here_and_I_need_advice_./gpu3lv9/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) for novices. (Not sure if this is specific to you, but for most young people it makes sense).

I assume you're an average novice young investor since you seem to post to r/gme a lot, so I would recommend Josh Brown's [book](https://www.amazon.com/How-Invest-My-Money-Finance/dp/0857198084) for you to think about how to invest. (Most people shouldn't be managing thier own account and choosing stocks.)

If you really want to start to understand fundemental analysis I would recommend Phil Fisher's books ([best one](https://www.amazon.com/Common-Stocks-Uncommon-Profits-Writings/dp/0471445509/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=common+stocks+and+uncommon+profits+by+philip+fisher&qid=1616890944&sprefix=uncommon+profits&sr=8-3) and [another one with both books combined](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B008847LKW/ref=dbs_a_w_dp_b008847lkw)). A video to watch is something like [this](https://youtu.be/oMmocnLnVgQ). It is good to watch to understand the investing mindset at a cursory level.

If after all that you think it is something you want to continue to do your own, then you can easily find other recommendations on here that are more complex and deal more directly with valaution. 

I hope that helps. Good luck."

So with the PPT rule I sometimes catch myself in a position with no day trades available. Without saying the stock I will give a example.
  Bought stock yesterday woke up to see a pre-market gap up. Sold 66% of my position. Open market dip slammed to my original position I bought back 66% of my shares. It did a lunch rush so I scalped 66%. 
  Now I hit 0 daytrades because I scalp often. Which means I can not stoploss the 33% shares I kept. Luckily for me it touched me again but slammed up. But ""lucky"" is not the way to trade for me. 
  So what if I am out of daytrades it goes to slam below me and I open a 33% share short position on my position to protect myself until the next day? Yea I cant make any money but I cant lose either. Also of course this is trading a stock where short shares are available.

2021-03-27 23:17:25,stocks,"[Rule 1 Investing] Stock price stagnation... how do you know when it's time to call it quits on one of your chosen companies? For those of you familiar with Phil Town's Rule 1 Investing:

Rule 1 was my first real exposure to investing, and now that I'm a ways down the road and have also spent time learning from many others, I still consider it a great starting point and still employ Rule 1 strategy despite broadening my knowledge.

I've spent countless hours listening to and reading Phil's stuff at this point, and I am grateful for his teaching, but there is still something I have yet to really hear him discuss and explain.

What happens when you pick a great company that has ALL the right metrics... and well... nothing happens? For reasons unknown, the stock price just never takes off and growth fails to materialize. You know you bought it undervalued (according to the numbers), and at a comfortable MOS, but it continues to just sit - undervalued - with only horizontal movement.

How long do we wait for it to take off and begin the climb of stock price eventually intersecting with the company's intrinsic value? I have no problem being patient, but I also think there's a line you cross where it's obvious that you would be better off in another company. For example, holding a stock for 10 years, seeing single digit gains, but being CONVINCED by the Rule 1 stats that it's still undervalued - well, doesn't seem like a wise use of investment capital. Even if the valuation metrics are still stellar, surely we don't just continue to hold indefinitely, right?

So what kind of time limit (or quarterly/annual performance standards) do we hold our investment choices to? (Also, has Phil actually posted discussion about this on YouTube, and I just missed it?) Thanks all!"
03/28/2021,stocks,"If you're buying unprofitable companies, then that's a risk you're taking. Trading current profits now for future growth in the hopes that the dividend it eventually pays out will be worth it. 

If you're buying a profitable company that continues growing profits...then the stock price shouldn't matter. Even if it's trading at half of it's fair value, a profitable company will be returning its profits to shareholders with either dividends or share buybacks. And if the stock price still stays stagnant...well...enjoy your 20% dividends or whatever (because a stock with sustainable 20% dividends is absolutely underpriced). 

I think a lot of investors lose sight of this and get caught in trading and speculation. The ultimate end goal of investing in any company should be to share in its profits at some point in the future. If it's not paying you dividends/buying back shares, then it better be doing something that will increase it's ability to do that in the future."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I am going to quote a well known Economist, John Maynard Keynes.  When the data changes, I change my mind.  If the reason you bought it is still there and the Price drops you get more.  If the reason you bought it is gone, then you need to let go.  Hope is not an Investment strategy."
03/28/2021,stocks,"You really have to look at the reason you invested in the company in the first place.  Are the assumptions you made about it still true?  If so then hold on to it.  If not then you need to reevaluate your position.  

Other things to consider are if it pays dividends and if you can sell calls.  It may trade sideways but if you still believe in it then sell covered calls to make money.  It might not be much but you could make 5-10% through calls or even selling puts."

This is very common. Its known as a value trap and if you go looking you will find them all around you. If we're being honest here, stock prices are dictated by popularity and feelings, not concrete, measurable financial factors. This is why its highly recommended to just buy a total market index fund instead of picking stocks. If you've got a real, legitimate, mathematically verifiable trading edge then that's different but if you are out here picking stocks based on P/E ratios, free cash flows, and earnings reports then the most likely outcome is that you are probably gonna get eaten alive."

03/28/2021,stocks,"If you truly believe in the company and truly believe it is undervalued, then trading flat is awesome as you can keep adding to your position at an undervalued price. Add the ability to sell covered calls and you're just winning,l. I would reccomend selling long dated calls at your fair valued price as maybe the market wakes up one day and ur stock reaches your price in the span of a few days or weeks.
 Example
 you think its worth 60 but its trading at 30 then sell a year or more out because calls that otm with short dates would be worth almost nothing. 
But if the difference is small such as it's at 50 and worth 60 then a month long covered call would be decent.

Keep in mind the market usually over reacts so selling short dated has the potential to miss out on the over reaction such as the price going from 50 to 75 meanwhile it stays there and you get assigned missing out on 15, and eventually a few days or even months later it corrects back to its fair value of 60."

No matter what a parasite real estate agents tell you - There is no way angent can add 5-6% (Their commision) value to a $1.000.000 house or not even a $500.000 house. I live in Denmark, and a normal agent fee for a $1.000.000 house would be around $10.000-$15.000 (And it’s pretty close to fixed may I add), but in the US the fee is more than 4x that, and it’s percentage based. How come? There is a service so somewhat new service were some good friends of ours sold their $1.300.000 house for only $3.000 in real estate commisions. They did everything for them A-Z, took pictures, marketed it, listed it online (Our own version of Zillow) and on MLS. They total cost for selling their house was around $4.500 after Lawyer fees and inspection fees. 

The service here is called Brikk - Link is in danish, so if you want proof: https://www.brikk.dk/

You don’t even need an Agent, and then the price gets knocked down to $2.000, and you just have to show around the house yourself.

- AT&t announces they will not pay a quarterly dividend, which I would imagine would make the price plunge. 

This is all my wrinkled brain can think of. I would imagine the first reason is the biggest not to do it. But in a down market? I’d love to hear other reasons against.

03/28/2021,stocks,"Oh where to begin... It's a combination of poor capitalization post-GFC, local market fragmentation, poor macroeconomic environment across the EU, and consequently ultra-low interest rate (low spread earned on assets) that's killing nearly all European banks. 

Like most other industries, winners tend to take more and more. With US banks topping league tables in most European institutional businesses, many European banks (other than a few like DB, Barclays, BNP etc.) have basically retrenched to doing 'boring' loan/spread business due to a lack of scale and technological investment to sustain their institutional/corporate business. (RBS is probably the best example of shutting down most of their capital market / IB business post-GFC through endless restructurings). 

This is also where the macro factor comes in. As some of these banks basically turning into traditional savings & loans bank, imagining making 75bps on a 5-year commercial loan due to low-rate environment across the EU, only to see the country go into another recession (hello Spain, Italy) and the bank having to write off \~5% or more of its book due to default -> you are risking \~5% of your capital to earn 75bps spread -> bad business model. 

Long-term upside is only realistic if there is a sustained period of economic growth (not the central bank printing induced type) that allows these banks to earn a higher spread (steeper EUR curve), face lower prospective credit defaults so they can repair their balance sheet. Otherwise they remain highly levered to the macroeconomic environment of the specific country / broader EU, and that means a lot of risk premium when discounting any future expected earnings..."

2021-03-27 20:21:17,stocks,"What does a stock split as a percent mean? Normally, a split is of the format ""X for Y"" which makes sense, but once in a while there are some that are labeled as a percent (see https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stock-splits). What does that mean (like currently with FIEB and CETXP)? I've tried looking around, but haven't really found any info regarding it (just endless explanations of the X for Y)"
03/28/2021,stocks,"I'd read the 5% as 20 for 1, but that's just thinking in terms of a ratio to percentage ... Actually 19:1 is 5% but that's more for odds, not sure how it applies to a split.

I'm thinking 1 for 2 for example would be 100% maybe since it creates 100% more shares, to me thinking in terms of percent, since it splits to create 2x as many shares .... So 20 for 1 would leave end result being 5% remaining of the share count before the split or it could be 19 for 20 leaving 5% more shares post split.

Would probably have to review info that is available specifically regarding the split, or reverse split is how iv seen reference to a split that creates less shares.

Still new and learning, got hit with a reverse split on a position Friday 75 for 1, 8k shares down to what I'm thinking will be 107, it's still not settled in my account .... So 1/75 would be 1.3% of the shares held before the split."

Our lockdowns were almost non existent and it seems the covid numbers here are not much differ than states going crazy with lockdowns.

But ultimately I think it will open up in us anyway that’s all I’m saying. 
It’s a difference of option and I’m not worried. If I’m wrong big deal 1000 shares is only about  .5 % of my portfolio. Why do you think they are waiting till mid April? They are probably working contingency plans to sail out of other ports if us does not allow and if it’s possible for them ect.  I think you are being one sided.

03/28/2021,stocks,"This bull run for the last 10 years has favored tech growth stocks heavily. AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, etc as interest rates have effectively gone to 0%. As interest rates rise though value stocks are going to outperform. Look at HD, CAT, BA, PG, K, IBM as of late. The dividend comes in to play as well. T pays 6.9%, TOT pays 6.7% KO pays 3.2%. It adds up YOY. You might not be getting 100% gains but your getting a boring yet reliably profitable company and avoiding wild 20% price swings every week. 

As we will likely witness sometime in the near future, many of these growth outfits will go toes up when actual profit matters more than hype of potential profit in the future."

IBM could be argued to fall into that category. It remains profitable but continues to watch competitors pass it by in certain areas. Cisco, Intel and Ebay are a few others that in my opinion fall in that category.

At the end of the day, a stock is only as valuable as what people are willing to pay. The company may still be profitable and contribute to the underpinnings of our society but people pass it by for whatever reason. Often this happens if the security is overshadowed by some looming existential threat. The value can be there but if it's never realized, it doesn't really matter."

It seems a lot of people joining finance subs are taking the casino approach to the market. I guess time will tell if that works out. Also, feel free to come back and tell me I’m and idiot if GME ever hits above $350, which was my exit price.

I know there's a bit of a learning curve but it's not too severe and once you learn the basics of reading a graph (which isn't too hard from learning the controls/gamely of a video game) it comes pretty easily. Plus they have at access articles about your investments. If you're really looking for another alternative I would do yahoo finance. They have very simple graphs and break downs and offer up articles that lack the over complicated bullshit terms and say things the way the average person will understand

03/28/2021,stocks,"Another vote for Fidelity from me.

When I first was exposed to the market(2004), it was through etrade because of my employer's stock plan. It seemed easy enough then and I was 19.

I gave ally invest a try a while back.. It's okay but ultimately i just wasn't satisfied with it. I've also been using Fidelity for a while. Originally through 401k but now it also has my brokerage and roth ira.

If I ever have to open up any more investment accounts, I wouldn't hesitate at all to open it at Fidelity."
03/28/2021,stocks,J.P. morgan is pretty good. They don't offer fractional shares tho
03/28/2021,stocks,Tbh i think stock sims like Investopedia or HowTheMarketWorks is better for beginners
03/28/2021,stocks,Anything
03/28/2021,stocks,"thinkorswim. It offers paper trading to get your feet wet, as well as a wealth of information available to learn about different concepts and strategies. It's through TD Ameritrade. Fairly simple, has an app on the app stores. Has separate accounts for paper and live trading."

03/28/2021,stocks,"Consider introducing him to the Boglehead approach and getting him started with a solid ETF/index mutual fund portfolio. In my opinion, when anyone is just learning about investing, they should start their portfolio with index funds. If they later want to start playing with stock picking, they can do it with a tiny percent of their portfolio.

But for someone young like your brother who is investing for the long-term, who shouldn't care about the day to day swings in the market, he should probably just start with ETFs. But then again, so should everyone, realistically.

This approach is particularly well suited for people who may not be super interested because they can ""set it and forget it,"" with automatic deposits and investments. If they do this, it could be in their favor as they may be less likely to sell in a market downturn.

This may be r/stocks, but ETFs are still a useful tool and may be a better fit for your brother. (Okay, let's be realistic, everyone should have most their portfolio in an index based strategy and the vast majority of people should solely use one) 

If you go the ETF route, Fidelity, Vangaurd, and Schwab would be my three recommended brokers, in no particular order. They generally have the best offerings in terms of ETFs with low expense ratios. You'll find that the Boglehead forums has an obsession with Vanguard, being that it was founded by Jack Bogle. However, Fidelity is equally great, has great customer support, has more physical locations, offers other services like a 2% cash back credit card, and has  even brought the race to the zero expense ratio ETF to the bottom. I'm less familiar with Schwab, but I believe their benefits are similar to Fidelity and I know they have low expense ratio ETFs. Oh, and Fidelity and Schwab's websites aren't as bad as Vamguard's.

As for the issue of ""How easy Robinhood is,"" that's by design and isn't helping you. Robinhood's UI is designed to make people focus on day to day market changes and making lots of trades when realistically you need to look at much longer trends and be making fewer trades. None of the other brokerages' UI's are so terrible that they are going to be hindering your brother. If anything, they will let him slow down and let him think about what he is doing instead of sparkling confetti in the screen every time he makes a trade."

Not really intuitive if you want a page of stocks you watch but it is there. I tend to check yahoo for everything I'm watching. If something is trading at a discount or price I want in pre/extended, then I'll open up the app to snag it."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Fidelity definitely supports fractional shares at least on the mobile app. They might have also added it to the desktop site recently, but I'm not positive."
03/28/2021,stocks,To confirm for you... You can fractional buy a company or an etf on Fidelity.
03/28/2021,stocks,"That's one thing that drives me crazy. I love Fidelity and I always use the app for all my buys but there are times when I'm working and I just want to open up a new tab, log in, and fractional buy on their website. The last time I checked(about a month ago), it still wasn't enabled on their site."
03/28/2021,stocks,"You can definitely buy fractional shares on the site.  Go to the order page after searching a ticker and click on 'dollars' I believe it is instead of shares, input the amount and you gold."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I was on the desktop site not too long ago and saw something up at the top like ""new: fractional shares"". Since this isn't all that new on mobile, I wondered if it maybe meant new to the desktop site (but didn't look into it)."

03/28/2021,stocks,"So SOXL is a 3x leveraged etf that has holdings specifically in semiconductors. Etfs aren’t stocks but a big soup of holdings in specific sectors, so SOXL holdings are primarily TSM AMD intel nvidia, big chip makers. Points are percentages +/-1%. When the “correction” downturn or whatever you wanna call it on the nasdaq started for various reasons recently Soxl’s main holdings lost value so its price went down as well. 

Now this is a buy the dip opportunity, SOXL being an etf typically has a ton of volume meaning if I write an option on it I’m very likely to be able to sell it quickly because there is a lot of buyers out there. I watched it bottom around 28 then slowly pushed past 32, between 32support and 35 resistance, but when it breaks 35 it runs to 38/39 very quickly. So for the past 3 weeks like clockwork it’s running up and down between 28-38. “LEAPS” are a term for long dated options usually expiring one to two years out. Leaps are a good defense against time decay and delta is typically over .6 so you’re getting almost 1$ per percentage it’s going up. Options contracts are in sets of 100 shares so you’re  getting 60-100$ in value per 1$ increase in price. When SOXL dips to 32 I buy a 40call leap and wait for it to push past 35 for that big gap up to 38 and I sell it for +300 to 500$. Being that it’s a leap if I’m wrong and it gaps down to 28 I’m still pretty safe because the time decay isn’t really an issue, so I just have to be patient.

So I don’t really know what I’m talking about but these leaps have made me 3k a week the past three weeks buying on Wednesday and selling Friday at noon. I can always hold them longer but I find when call options go over 100% (I mostly trade small cap tech) nobody will buy them and typically I don’t have cash to exercise and sell the shares awarded. Good luck I probably come off as a lunatic."
03/28/2021,stocks,"I would push you to Google. I not trying to be an asshole, there’s a shitload of jargon associated with trading. I’ll touch on the two I’m pretty sure of:

03/28/2021,stocks,"That's incredibly false. If you look at value metrics and tilt your head to the side and close 1 eye you could say those companies are fairly valued. 

Those are growth companies, if you look at their current valuations  compared to their assests and revenue you are wrong to call them undervalued.

Second, they are not oversold. Go look at their RSI, I took a peek at the Nasdaq and it's sitting at 50. It's not oversold or overbought. 

It's cool if you have opinions about companies in the nasdaq but don't use an opinion as a fact. Yes, in 5 years Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft will likely grow out of their current valuations but that doesn't make them undervalued right now."

How are you feeling about the many stocks that are dipping significantly from their ATH yet gained nearly 100% in the last year? They all have massive PE and if the market continues to trend up (specifically tech) is this a good time to buy? Or do you think many of these stocks could cut 40% off in the next year to a more ""realistic"" value?"
03/28/2021,stocks,"It really depends on the stock. I will look into ""is this stock fundamentally different than it was a year ago"" and if not, I don't trust the 100% run up. This recent correction might not be the one but there will be a reckoning eventually.

But there are some where I think it's justified. Covid presented an opportunity for some brands to become entrenched in people's lives. Roku is an example of this.

And in some cases, I think they overshot. Peloton, as an example, is certainly better off now than pre-covid, but the stock rise seems unjustified to me. 

Usually this just means I stay away. There's plenty of things I find more solid than to muck around with what ifs. In a few cases, I've seen them sliding outside of general market trends and have been making some good money shorting them (put debit spreads).

03/28/2021,stocks,It's only relevant when you're dealing with legacy businesses. Most tech companies don't operate under the basis of P/E because they are mainly growth companies that reinvest a ton of their profits back into the business. It's just a horrible metric to use for tech stocks. It's actually not just Amazon and Netflix unless you're referring to penny stocks only. There are simply better metrics than to use P/E for tech. You don't compare the P/E of tech companies to let's say Home Depot for a reason. Different sectors require different metrics.

FSD is a toy for geeks amusement. For everyone else it has little practical value, because it requires paying more attention to the road than when you are driving yourself, making driving more stressful, not less.

An useful driving assistance package is one that is entirely predictable, even if it works only in restricted situations.
Smart cruise control so you don’t have to pay attention to speed limits, lane centering for long stretches of straight highway, low speed stop and go in tight traffic, blind spot monitoring and danger warnings, these are all useful, at condition they work in simple at predictable ways.

You don’t want them to use a logic so “advanced” that you can’t easily predict their actions.

(I have personally talked to some, to answer your question) C) Is all of this is directly the US's fault instead of a complex interplay between all factions involved? 

I read the article, it's interesting. It still doesn't explain the prisons that have been photographed, the multiple accounts of religious oppression in China and the fact that Indian sources, human rights sources and individual accounts have said something's going on.

Whether or not its exactly what the US says it is (most likely not), I do believe given the evidence, *something* is happening.

Edit: I did a deeper dive than that article or the ""fuck China"" articles... that shit is a hyper-complex interplay between Russian, Turkish, Taiwanese, Chinese, Uighur and American interests.its like a giant fucking medley of complicated."

03/28/2021,stocks,"I gave up on syncing it to my Outlook a while ago. The annoying part is that despite our entirely sales team being outfitted with SF, the executive team does not use or know how to use it. This means we have pull every piece of information off our SF dashboard when they want reports in excel, and it’s not always easy to transfer the data. Other problems I have with it are its extremely slow loading speed. A fully loaded Adobe Premiere project with VFX loads faster than converting a lead to contact half the time.  It would be impossible reverting back to not using it though, which is credit to its overall utility. It also seems to have a lot of difficulty recognizing duplicates until the very last moment and you’ve already wasted 3 minutes loading all a lead’s information. All in all, the average salesperson will really only use about 1% of SF’s total features, in the same way a magazine editor will only use 1% of Photoshop’s features when editing photos."

Debt is kind of tricky. A lot of people see financing as bad. A lot of the automakers have debt + financing debt/loans on their book. So people value it with that in mind.

Slow, GM and F are so slow. They want to be all EV by 2035. When China and other countries are already pushing for 2025/2030 green initiatives. Korea, Japan and China come to mind.

03/28/2021,stocks,"Not quite - though, you’re still overall correct.

He’s doing a straddle, meaning he’s playing the “stonks always go up or down” game. If he’s getting a true straddle, he’ll make money either way and lose money if the stock trades sideways.

That said, you’re still right. A stock trading sideways would fuck him/her and it’s twice the loss than just playing it in one direction. It is a good move, though. Plenty of people do exactly this on volatile stocks in volatile markets and tend to make out - but 5% profit isn’t that much of one sideways trading period would result in 50-100% loss as might be the case with long straddles ( totally depends on how OTM he’s buying and if it’s weighted to one side or not)."
03/28/2021,stocks,"There’s a lot of wild assertions in this that are very subject to market conditions.

The wheel is far from a perfect strategy. It’s a great strategy with stocks that stay mostly in range, but there are a lot of ways to lose money with it. You’re making the assumption that given enough time, the stock will always recover to its entry point price.

I’m not knocking the wheel btw, it works very well with mostly stable stocks - I’ve done very well wheeling JPM for a long long time. I just don’t like statements like “never not make money” and “little risk”. 

They’re not at all applicable to the wheel. Though, yes with careful stock selection you are minimizing risk but in a lot of ways you can end up more exposed if something goes wrong mid wheel turn when you’re holding actual shares."

If the weekly chart is overbought and the daily chart is overbought....it is time to exit the position or reverse it if you have the margin. I have learned to scan for stocks under 30 on stochastics and figure out which ones are moving back up. If the stock is oversold and you get movement above the EMA 8  and it continues positive the next day.....winner, winner buy it up and wait for the big green candle with lots of volume before you sell in the overbought area. I stay away from low float stocks, Pharma, lifescience, bioscience and medical stocks because they can lose half their value overnight on BS news. At least look up stochastics and see how the indicator works before you decide that it is too much work to learn something new to keep your portfolio from going red all the time because you are buying when everyone should be selling. It is called the Euphoria section of a chart. Good luck and happy investing."

* We're looking at overbought on the RSI (30 min)
* MACD shows strength we could run up higher

We've had a couple weak W shapes on the S&P in the past couple months. This leads me to believe that we may be in the midst of a strong W forming.

1. The first sharp decline: 3/4
2. The first sharp rise: 3/16
3. Second decline: This is what we might experience next, a sharp pull back potentially back to 3/4 levels
4. Second rise: Recovery into a bull market, less techy growth stocks and more fundamental based value stocks

Correlation between Suez Canal ship and Treasury yield rates. We are currently in a detachment with the S&P 500 and treasury yields. Treasury yields are rising, and the S&P is going up (it should be going down). If Treasury yields rise significantly to 1.7%-1.9% levels we could experience a sharp pull back, (See #3 above). If the ship can't be moved by the end of the weekend, the risk is there for Treasury yields to rise. Thus, a market pull back."

03/28/2021,stocks," SHOPIFY: Fraud, Ponzi or combination of both? 

Company that gave an illusion that it is new Amazon that will make its shareholders millionaires. In my opinion it either does fraudulent financial reporting, operates as a Ponzi scheme or is a combination of both. This DD are for those people who have already invested, because no one in clear mind will invest in a 17-year-old company who has >400 PE ratio. That is why to save your time I will not explain company operations or other details. 

Our main resource will be Shopify annual report (hereafter - AR) presented on the website of Shopify: 

[https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc\_financials/2020/ar/40-F.pdf](https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/40-F.pdf) 

I will refer to pages of it as AR p.xxx  

Revenue - bullshit 

Let's start with revenue (AR p.103). 2 of 3 bln. is coming from merchant solutions. I don’t believe this figure. For several reasons. 

1) (AR p.101) In audit opinion it is stated that revenue recognition (Principal Vs Agent) was a subject to both management and audit judgement. If auditors were sure about correctness of revenue recognition, they wouldn’t mention it. 

2) WIX, competitor of SHOPIFY, has similar number of live websites but has 10 times less revenue from merchant solutions (they call it business) than SHOPIFY. This figure looks much more correct to me since I think that both WIX and SHOPIFY are agents with respect of merchant solutions. 

Financial statements of WIX are: 

[https://sec.report/Document/0001178913-21-001179/](https://sec.report/Document/0001178913-21-001179/) 

3) (ARp.102) Balance sheet. How can a company with 3 bln. of sales have 0 inventories? Even if it is in 17 million other current assets (AR.p.122) the number is still very low. 

4) And finally, revenues are not matching reality. If a commission of SHOPIFY is 10% as they claim and I believe it since it is an appropriate expense ratio for an average store, it means that total amount of sales from all SHOPIFY stores is 140 billion. 1/3 of all imports from China to USA. This looks as unreal number. I refer to imports because most of stores on SHOPIFY are doing dropshipping. We will return to it later. 

Sales and marketing costs. 

(AR p.103)  Since I don’t believe in revenue figure, I will refer to gross profit. It is 1.5 bln. For this gross profit SHOPIFY spends 600 mln. on sales and marketing. That means one dollar spent on ads gives only 2.56 dollars of gross profit.  This number is very low and indicates that SHOPIFY is not such a good or mass product. Reminder, company exists for 17 years. 

Research and development 

(AR p.103) SHOPIFY spends hundreds of millions on research and development. But we don’t see any increase in intangible assets or PPE. Why a company that uses creative accounting to show good sales is not using it to capitalize R&D expenses and show higher profit? In my opinion, because those expenses aren't R&D but Cost of sales. Recently companies started to use creative accounting to reclass COGS to R&D and show better gross profit margin. The most recent example is Plug power. 

Unrealized gain on equity and other investments 

Despite all the manipulations P&L still does not look good. We have 90 million income from operations from a company with >100 bln. market cap. To show a better picture SHOPIFY decided to find another source of income – revaluation of purchased assets – 135 million. It is 150% of income from operations. (AR p.120) They received investment in Affirm in July and measured it low. In September they revalued it and got 133 million profit. Both evaluations were done in the same quarter. They have created a profit out of thin air. If we exclude this profit from EPS calculation it will fall to 1.56 and PE ratio will become 700. 

The information below is subjective and not supported by evidence, but I feel responsible to mention other concerns. 

Additional information. 

I don’t believe in cash figure either. (AR p.118) The cash consists mostly of commercial papers and bonds. It is hard to audit, you can't just send confirmation request to the bank and receive a reliable evidence. You perform physical examination of those documents. They can be forged, they can be borrowed. And statement of cashflows (AR.p105) shows that there is a consistent outflow of cash from trading of marketable securities. 

Dropshipping 

In my opinion dropshipping became a Ponzi scheme in the last a couple of years. People purchase from one store that purchases from another and so on. One sale can go through up to 10 stores on its way prom consumer to producer. It is in internet environment where most producers have their own websites. SHOPIFY relies heavily on dropshippers and when pyramids will fail, I expect that SHOPIFY will suffer. I am not sure if SHOPIFY is involved or it is just used. Its provides very good instrument for pyramid schemes.

03/28/2021,stocks,"We never hear about Book Value per Share because the thing that matters is that the market values a company at and not what the book says the company should be valued at. For starters, book value does not capture what the market views for the growth prospects of the firm which is a large part of growth stocks' share price. Second, the book value rarely captures information about intangibles such as brand value. While there is a spot on the balance sheet for intangibles, something like Apple's brand recognition is hard to place a dollar value on. Third, the PE ratio is a metric of a firm's market value of equity, (price/earnings per share is the same as market cap/earnings) therefore, the appropriate comparable is Book Value of Equity / Earnings, which can be negative. Taken all together, the book value per share can be at times ok but also very misleading."

so 2 out of 3 of your purchases were made within the last 30 days

Try to buy dips on red days though, but if youre in it for the long term it shouldnt really matter. Long term is safer than trying to play the market when youre new"

03/28/2021,stocks,"Pretty much useless. These days the only useful ways of valuing companies are DCF/forward PE for growth and just standard PE for value plays.

Be careful in current environment though, there are going to be a lot of value traps out there with huge amounts of debt being taken on by bleeding boomer companies that won't necessarily make it through the recovery. If you want to buy value then you will also need to be looking at cash on hand and debt to determine if the company is healthy enough to keep paying dividends and not collapse after rates go back up."

Yeah you're right that it seems to be calculating the entire loss correctly, but it's going through this unnecessary wash sale thing."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Or use a lot of leverage + risky derivatives.

Blow up the ship? Have you *seen* pictures of the current situation. The ship is MASSIVE, even if it was blown to pieces, the chucks would litter the canal and stop other ships passing. Its a 24m deep canal, not a bottomless ocean. The ship would barely sink.

As for why the containers aren't moved off... That will take a big crane being moved to the area - which will take time. It is a last resort, as moving containers could unbalance the ship and cause it to break in half - which would make this crises take literally months to resolve - as a giant 'effing cargo ship would need to be taken apart piece by piece and hauled off.

If containers *could* be safely moved off, the ship would float higher in the canal and there would be no need to blow it up, as it would become unstuck. It will be what they try if tugging attempts this weekend don't work."

03/28/2021,stocks,Why didht you sell at 70s? 85? It might be a while before that bud.
03/28/2021,stocks,"that's the thing with the wash sale rule.   
when you sold buy#1, it saw that you made buy#2 and buy#3 minutes or hours later.   
so you technically bought the stock (#2 and #3) in the 30 days prior to sale of #1.   
That's likely why the wash sale was disallowed.  
Bottom line is, the IRS is not ripping you off at least."

03/28/2021,stocks,The only way to make 100k on a 10% increase in a stock is by doing what’s called “options trading” where you essentially bet on a stock going up or down instead of actually investing and buying shares in that company otherwise mathematically you can’t make 100k on a 10% increase unless you invested 1 million as 10% of one million is 100k
03/28/2021,stocks,"I think what you mean is something you can invest 100 dollars in and have it go up 100,000%, giving you $100,000.  I would suggest you go back in time to roughly 2009 and buy 2 bitcoins. If you can’t find your time machine, none of us can help you accomplish this."

So if he were to exercise it he'd pay $6700 for 100 stocks at $67. 

So say stock goes to $75 and he wants to sell the contract how much profit does he get? 

Because upfront you do not front the $6700 correct? If say April 1st came and stocks at $60 so he sells for a loss how is that calculated? Is that money already pulled from their account? How is the loss calculated/ where do they pay it from?"

03/28/2021,stocks,"Well, the overall market tanked because of macro issues unrelated to your equities.

And tech stocks tanked hardest. They were idiotically overvalued (and some still are). 

Plus, money is rotating out of tech into infrastructure and commodities ahead of Biden's announcement of the next phase of spending (around 3 trillion on building).

Recovery isn't going as quickly or smoothly as people would like. These things take time. People expect it to happen tomorrow. 

Your consumer retail and travel stocks will come up, but the industry has to recover. People being vaccinated and planning on travel/buying stuff isn't a recovery. No one is making real money on hotels and flights yet.

Meanwhile, everyone got so excited about how much money they'll make if they buy retail/travel stocks that they've become overvalued for the most part.

Depending on what price you bought your holdings at, they may have been serverly overvalued at time of purchase.

Put simply, some of your stocks came down because they shouldn't have been that high in the first place.

Diversifying a portfolio between tech, a couple banks and some retail/travel stocks is enough in this market. You have a lot of growth stock and I don't see much by way of large cap. You holdings are basically only in a few sectors.

Look at how stocks for infrastructure are doing (and how well commodities have been doing).

I think your portfolio has a lot of good to it but it's not going to shine right now.

Well... Except the next week or two. I think things will blow up pretty huge before the next downturn."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Oil is tricky right now because so much is influencing price. Travel stocks are overvalued because people are doing what they did with tech - pricing in future profits then bailing because future isn't happening right away.

SPX and DOW seem to be the best bet these days. Infrastructure stocks have started to tick up in advance of Biden's next big announcement - $3trillion in economic spending on infrastructure and economy.

Tech stocks will probably pop up this week. Stim checks are still hitting. Mood of the market seems pretty bouyant after Friday. Biden's about to open his wallet again. But I think they'll decline again. 

The market in general is still MASSIVELY overvalued."
03/28/2021,stocks,"Travel stocks got overpriced (and many still are). 

And now people are worried about vaccine efficacy, new strains and supply/distribution so profits for travel stocks are further out now. 

Financials don't like low interest rates when there is a surplus of money floating around. People aren't borrowing money when they can get it for free. Loan interest isn't much $. And the SLR rule was repealed.

You can see money is flowing out of other stocks like tech and fin stocks and into infrastructure stocks. Industry. Commodities (like steel and concrete).

Biden's next big plan will be announced soon - three trillion to be spent on infrastructure (and likely other things - he may touch on green energy, pot legalization - which would give the country much needed tax revenue and jobs).

It's likely infrastructure stocks will get run up and be overpriced too. 

I also think it's likely there is a more legitimate crash on the way. The market is just too overvalued and, unless Biden and the Fed pull off a massive miracle with taxes, job creation and increasing consumer spending, the economy could be in a real mess."
