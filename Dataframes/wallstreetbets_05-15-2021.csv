2021-05-15 19:25:03,wallstreetbets,Could’ve joined us on GME smh. You rather take a gamble with this BS stock
2021-05-15 19:57:14,wallstreetbets,"I just discussed PLTR with my Financial Advisor and his firm has a PLTR price target of $10 EOY. He's recommending XLF, XLE, HDV, and dividend-paying value stocks in general."
2021-05-15 19:33:44,wallstreetbets,"You clearly know what you’re talking about, fellow Palantard... so let me ask you this, in all honesty, where do you see this stock going by EOY? Do you have a price range?"
2021-05-15 19:48:08,wallstreetbets,GME at 160$ isn’t BS
2021-05-15 19:48:17,wallstreetbets,"I would consider 30 to be realistic barring any macro market shenanigans.  Fundamentals are solid but the sell pressure from lock up expiration, which is still being felt now, was extremely underestimated.  The stock based compensation just puts more pressure on the price near term.  The float is massive, even bigger than Tesla's, so it'll take some time for this ship to move."
2021-05-15 19:41:18,wallstreetbets,Vitards going wsb mainstream again once the thesis is proven right
2021-05-15 19:12:05,wallstreetbets,NUE and STLD are better imo
2021-05-15 19:07:39,wallstreetbets,So you’re saying buy puts?
2021-05-15 19:15:14,wallstreetbets,"I also own NUE and believe it’s best in class. I will write a DD on NUE to explain my thoughts. I just think there is still a lot of room left for X. I think NUE and STLD are great investments with less risk, but I think they have already had a strong run."
2021-05-15 19:12:27,wallstreetbets,"Its shorted to fuck and is the lowest it's ever been. The borrow fee is nearly 100% and there's no shares left. The float is tiny.

2021-05-15 18:29:33,wallstreetbets,"""Add that to the 1.25% dividend yield (i.e., 10 cents annually divided by $7.98). So the “total yield” as I call it, is worth about 2.95% (i.e., 23.6 cents divided by $7.98). At $10 per share, the total yield is 2.36%, a more appropriate valuation.""

This is incorrect. Dividend yield is 0.1/quarter so its 0.4 annually"
2021-05-15 19:07:15,wallstreetbets,There is a lot of pressure on the fed to start tapering off bond buying sometime soon and the fed has assured the market they will announce this well in advance. The best time to buy UWM will be a couple days after this announcement.

I dont think I'll ever go back to my pre-lockdown throwaway spending again, but I was lightly in the stock market since I was 25, about 8 years. I legit don't care if the malls are closed, because I found I didn't need any of those tangible goods. I saved some money and invested some. I'll pretty much go back to normal, minus excess shit laying around that I don't need."

2021-05-15 17:53:15,wallstreetbets,How much and when?  Get the fuck out of here Kenny. We don't do dates. We also don't sell
2021-05-15 19:23:07,wallstreetbets,WITH AMC SQUEEZE AND GME..I CAN BUY ALL THE 10s I WANT. LOL
2021-05-15 18:35:10,wallstreetbets,Sounds like the problem is you need to pick some 10's that would turn into 2's but before you sleep it off but trade with some other sorry bloke for their 7's that will become a 6 so you wakeup with a respectable chick who will become your wife one day then you can take her boyfriends money to buy more stonks.
2021-05-15 17:52:42,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a wendys please stfu
2021-05-15 18:59:53,wallstreetbets,After years of research and study I believe the best strategy is to YOLO on deep otm calls of meme stonks a year before the expiration date.
2021-05-15 19:01:11,wallstreetbets,I had to chew my left arm off one morning to get away from a $3 stock. Definitely took a loss on that one.
2021-05-15 18:56:23,wallstreetbets,I am excited to take my woman out to a real Wendy’s. Where we can have a romantic dinner in the dining area instead of in the car.
2021-05-15 18:29:18,wallstreetbets,Never gets old.
2021-05-15 17:58:06,wallstreetbets,"Everybody thinks I’m crazy when I won’t spend more than 50 bucks a week on anything but stonks. My entire pay minus 50 a week goes into the market. And if it crashes, that means I can buy more."
2021-05-15 17:58:03,wallstreetbets,"Ok. So if everyone does what you do, what happens to the reopening trade?

Isn't it true that if people who didn't spend thier money on services and malls and all of that during the pandemic spent it on stonks, then they would have to buy less stonks in order to go to Vegas and buy the family package at the cruise line?

Either the reopening trade happens and people spend their money on Services.

Or people do like you and spend less than they did before so they can continue to invest in stonks. 

Right?"
2021-05-15 19:34:14,wallstreetbets,"I'm getting a ton of serious ideas like yours.

Surprising actually."
2021-05-15 19:00:39,wallstreetbets,I considered cruise 🚢 lines but then I considered how much debt they have.
2021-05-15 17:53:23,wallstreetbets,"Cruise lines are going to be busy.

So many people want to do something."
2021-05-15 17:53:36,wallstreetbets,Yes CCL🔜🛳 it’s the last Covid recovery play left out there
2021-05-15 19:12:47,wallstreetbets,"FYI covid is spreading among vaccinated people in tourist spots see headline below. This alone will make cruise lines risky as while vaccination does reduce severity among people less than 60 it is still severe for elderly and guess who the biggest age group  for cruises?

CNN: The Seychelles is 60% vaccinated, but still infections are rising. That's not as bad as it sounds"

2021-05-15 18:01:31,wallstreetbets,Is it? Meh I was worried about it. I’m still heavy on weed stocks anyway
2021-05-15 18:40:28,wallstreetbets,Fuck sorry I forgot to say drink better/more booze to get that 10 who turns into a 2. The key is trading her to a guy you also drank a lot so you trade up for the better girl. Basically arbitrage with the aid of alcohol
2021-05-15 19:20:33,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, chili, chocolate frosty, double cheeseburger, fries and baconator for the road"
2021-05-15 18:03:28,wallstreetbets,Anything I want. I learned how to budget on 200 a month and basically ask myself numerous times if I need something before I buy it. I cook my own shit too. Wayyyyy cheaper. You’d be amazed after a few months how much you’d save and how much equity you can build in stocks doing so
2021-05-15 18:07:43,wallstreetbets,Same. Long hold til the turn around. Buy them for cheap rn. Canopy is a win

Good thing about early earnings calls - companies rarely announce something like accounting errors or that they are closing the shop. Thats the only thing that could stop us apes from getting richer. But it is usually the opposite - some good news on time of good news. Future is with CLOV. I am not hoping for a squeeze anymore even though I did my best to contribute to it, but I would take hot air balloon over rocket as long as it flies and even it takes another quarter to reach a higher layers of stratosphere.

2021-05-15 15:26:15,wallstreetbets,There's a few good buyss on the market right now. This is definitely one of them. So is $UWMC. Especially with that sweet sweet dividend. Where else can you get 6% return and a bonus when stonk goes up?

2021-05-15 17:46:04,wallstreetbets,"Short selling is how you make money when stocks go down. Borrow the share, sell it, price goes down, buy it back and return to lender and keep the difference.

If however the price goes up because millions of wsb apes suddenly buy in to that company then the short seller is fucked. At some point the short seller has to cut their losses and buy back the shares they shorted which then, if it's a lot of shares, pushes the price up further. This is the squeeze."

Thats how shorts make money ""shorting"" stocks.

The problem occurs if you sell at 10 but the stock goes to 40, you have to buy the share back at 40 meaning you have a 300% loss, MUCH more then someone who is ""long"" on stock shares."

2021-05-15 16:44:21,wallstreetbets,"All you have to post is AMC, GME, moon, or similar words and everyone jumps on your dick. This sub should be called WallStreetCircleJerk, so glad I was able to witness it in it's golden days before the influx of teenagers that don't even trade started leaving the dumbest comments for karma. Not only did they take out this sub, but pretty much every financial related sub on reddit now has been ruined. There are still some nuggets of info in specific smaller private subs though."
2021-05-15 15:25:29,wallstreetbets,40% SI speaks for itself.
2021-05-15 17:21:16,wallstreetbets,ur not wrong but the entirety of the market has been incessantly shorted since Covid started so its not even far fetched to say there’s more chances for short squeezes than there were years prior
2021-05-15 15:13:46,wallstreetbets,Yes crazy times.
2021-05-15 16:13:02,wallstreetbets,I'd me mad happy if it does. I'll take a looong ass vacay and stay away from trading for a month then
2021-05-15 16:47:25,wallstreetbets,now this is some dumb shit.
2021-05-15 15:58:07,wallstreetbets,I hope you’re right

Sure he's a corporate scumbag and is gonna make a lot of money, but that doesn't mean the companies he takes public can't flourish. He'd make way more of they do."

2021-05-15 15:52:40,wallstreetbets,Wrong
2021-05-15 16:01:32,wallstreetbets,Well they cut their losses 50% from 2019 to 2020 while the revenue went up 50%. They expect to be profitable in 2023.
2021-05-15 18:39:31,wallstreetbets,"No dip Monday 

Dip is gone"
2021-05-15 16:41:06,wallstreetbets,100% or nothing?

Bro it’s possible to squeeze other stonks 

And this will squeeze to over 50$ if it really squeezes!"
2021-05-15 17:40:50,wallstreetbets,High short interest ≠ squeeze.
2021-05-15 16:03:39,wallstreetbets,Good earnings report and PR ≠ stock go up

2021-05-15 15:30:26,wallstreetbets,">a bunch of apes bought calls to get the gamma going.

No, if they bought calls, they did it to make money for themselves.  They’re not doing it to get anything going, because 1) they can’t and 2) they don’t care about your bags, anyone who thinks they can manipulate the market with a few calls is retarded."
2021-05-15 16:12:04,wallstreetbets,!remindme 48 hours
2021-05-15 17:02:39,wallstreetbets,Jesus stop saying gamma squeeze or short squeeze for everything.

2021-05-15 17:48:41,wallstreetbets,Thank you I understand now.
2021-05-15 16:43:56,wallstreetbets,It can be very dangerous especially if enough people get on board and take that stock to the moon.
2021-05-15 17:13:18,wallstreetbets,No they don’t necessarily have to buy if the stock goes to 40. They might have to buy for other reasons linked to the stock going to 40 or choose to do so if they think that will limit their losses. They can also wait for the price to go back down.
2021-05-15 15:04:31,wallstreetbets,Fine 2
2021-05-15 17:33:49,wallstreetbets,It will all buff out.

2021-05-15 16:57:15,wallstreetbets,What was your alt during those times? I'd love to see some of your other plays. Oh that's right.........Have fun losing money 😭
2021-05-15 16:11:52,wallstreetbets,"But doesn't clov have more then 40% si reported on the 5th? Add to the fact that there is somewhat a gamma ramp potential, don't you think this will fly?"
2021-05-15 16:35:31,wallstreetbets,"Bro how are you comparing MVIS.

They made 500k and were worth several
Billion..

Lmao !!"

2021-05-15 16:43:32,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 72hrs “squeeze?”
2021-05-15 16:47:21,wallstreetbets,So Puts Monday at close?
2021-05-15 15:55:56,wallstreetbets,Ok have fun
2021-05-15 19:28:56,wallstreetbets,"Given that RH turned off the buy button during the squeeze - no, no we don't"
2021-05-15 19:02:53,wallstreetbets,Yeah maybe. Gut feeling is the company is a scam. I have a few $15 June options so I'd be happy to see it take off.
2021-05-15 16:45:47,wallstreetbets,"I like GME a lot more than I like CLOV. In short, I’ll buy more GME on Moonday 🤗"
2021-05-15 17:58:41,wallstreetbets,Alright I’ll save this post and remember it for Monday morning. Whats your Price target?
2021-05-15 18:01:34,wallstreetbets,"Not everything is a squeeze bro. People saw what happened to GME in January and think it’s supposed to happen every month now. All that mentality does is create bagholders. I especially hate these ER Squeeze posts because how do you even know the Er will be GOOD? And even if it is, how do you know it will be good enough to cause a squeeze?"
2021-05-15 19:03:53,wallstreetbets,I kid I kid. I just don’t see this going up Monday. I hope it does though man gl! 🤞
2021-05-15 18:23:05,wallstreetbets,You gonna provide a source or tell me to look it up myself?

2021-05-15 16:17:14,wallstreetbets,That doesn’t really sound like a good short term play but you guys do you
2021-05-15 18:41:24,wallstreetbets,"I mean I could be wrong but this usually happens with earnings, I’m thinking one more red day for clov, maybe just a half red day at least in the morning at open, it’s like reading earning reports give people a stroke, if they make less than 50 billion in revenue people panic even though we are going through a fucking pandemic where 99% of business are gonna lose or break even"

2021-05-15 16:37:50,wallstreetbets,Well if you would learn to read you would notice I was referring to a squeeze.
2021-05-15 16:48:37,wallstreetbets,"By all means invest, I just hate it when people mislead others with nonsense about a squeeze. Thanks for the insult about my wife, you're real mature."

2021-05-15 16:39:12,wallstreetbets,"This shouldn’t be compares to MVIS in any way.

High short interest

Just need to add gas to the Rocket on Monday"
2021-05-15 17:20:09,wallstreetbets,"Lol .. you started this comment section by calling everyone retarded .. lol.. I agree  “short squeeze” is abused now with every stock.. CLOV has a high SI and so there is potential, but it would take a very good ER to ignite that rocket"
2021-05-15 16:50:51,wallstreetbets,"i agree, sorry that was not very mature of me.  my apologies!"
2021-05-15 17:31:17,wallstreetbets,"In all fairness, his insult was about you (in that she won't even listen to you)"

2021-05-15 18:31:51,wallstreetbets,"yes, but do you have a source or is this your guess?"
2021-05-15 15:44:13,wallstreetbets,"Besides screaming SHORT SQUEEZE and crossing your fingers that some fool will buy your shit for more than your dumbass paid for it, what's the play here?  This is another Chamath junk SPAC. By tuesday it won't even be allowed on WSB."
2021-05-15 16:03:54,wallstreetbets,"How many quarters of posting losses before they expand to lose money in more locations?

They did the SPAC, the capital has been raised.  They haven't put it to good use, and the intial investors (like Chamath) have wiped their hands.

It's shit bro.  Get out."
2021-05-15 17:34:54,wallstreetbets,"Anything really, as long as the font stays in red"
2021-05-15 17:44:24,wallstreetbets,No I’ll be here to laugh at your 3-10 dollar “squeeze”
2021-05-15 17:45:32,wallstreetbets,Your “squeeze” is just a normal fucking Monday for GME.
2021-05-15 17:46:22,wallstreetbets,"Exactly my point, avoid the real and make jokes. This is too easy, and why you’re still on wallstreetbets like a simp."
2021-05-15 17:33:21,wallstreetbets,2020 net income 3.38 billion. Not a $7 stock. Not even close.
2021-05-15 16:51:22,wallstreetbets,Their tech is pretty average too 🤷🏻‍♂️
2021-05-15 16:42:04,wallstreetbets,"You don't know how many times people say that, it just need this or that. Unless it literally is shooting up and shows that investors are interested. It's just another stock with a hype."

2021-05-15 16:05:26,wallstreetbets,"So your original point was complete bullshit. Cool. That’s all I needed to know. Hopefully these print next week.

Chamath, his partner and their firms can’t sell until price is 15 for 20/30 days and CEO can’t until price is 30 for 90 consecutive. What? Where are you getting your info?"
2021-05-15 17:36:00,wallstreetbets,Ok goals for Monday

2021-05-15 17:50:10,wallstreetbets,"I’ve always known about squeezing.

Calm down. 

First one I was involved in was TLRY a few years ago. 

Stop being so butt hurt. 
You can stay with your GME

2021-05-15 17:43:23,wallstreetbets,You know there are 1B+ shares?
2021-05-15 16:45:41,wallstreetbets,"Only time will tell.

I been watching it get pummeled for 6 months."
2021-05-15 18:06:59,wallstreetbets,Why does this sound like MVIS and ROOT to me lol. I’m just gonna be quiet and see Monday. Neither of us can predict the future so I’ll be fair and give it a chance. If this doesn’t squeeze however I just want this to be the start of the end of these Er squeeze post. All of them have been wrong.
2021-05-15 17:16:11,wallstreetbets,Keep hoping.  Hope is all you got.
2021-05-15 17:49:50,wallstreetbets,And you’re on RH! Remember me. Ill forget you.
2021-05-15 17:53:28,wallstreetbets,"Tlry you call that a squeeze? Gtfo you’re an actual moron. I’ll try and remember you, but i come across so many idiots you’ll just blend in. Tlry LOL!"
2021-05-15 17:55:05,wallstreetbets,"Glad you had enough time to Google a “squeezed” stock lol. 10 minutes for that reply, yet you replied other things in real time. This is classic."
2021-05-15 17:44:49,wallstreetbets,It's not about how many shares are out there. It's about how many are owned. And that number will shrink the more they buy back. But yes. 2 + 2 = 4.
2021-05-15 18:16:37,wallstreetbets,Fair enough

Apparently no one drove for DoorDash in that town, because our food was never picked up.  We kept calling to try and figure it out and even called the restaurant directly.  They told us that even if we showed up they couldn’t give us our own food without permission from DoorDash.  DD finally canceled our order about an hour and a half later.  At least we got a refund, but by that point we were unable to drive and had to subsist on the random snacks we happened to have with us."

2021-05-15 18:44:16,wallstreetbets,Were you just super late?  There was good money to be made on those puts when DoorDash was still above $170.

2021-05-15 14:36:51,wallstreetbets,He got 800 shares sold short with a profit of 1872 usd and 5 call contracts he sold short/wrote (thetagang). Aint that hard.
2021-05-15 14:18:45,wallstreetbets,"Wtf is this trade can someone explain. Is he selling naked calls and shorting the stock or covered calls? 

Door dash is going up long term. Impressive revenue growth and EBITDA so I don't know about this play. Probably you are going to lose some money."

It was laughably bad service, the dude had to have done that on purpose.  A complete scam company that wants to charge people for purposely non delivered product.  I wouldn’t even invest my wife’s BFs money into this piece of shit company."

2021-05-15 17:10:04,wallstreetbets,This happened to me yesterday the delivered to the wrong place. Customer service gave me another order free plus $40 of credit for inconvenience. I’ll take it.
2021-05-15 16:49:27,wallstreetbets,Maybe Chad across town tipped more
2021-05-15 17:23:13,wallstreetbets,"You sound like a bloody retard. Sure, hate the company. Sure, you might have had a shitty driver. But you obviously have no idea how the driver side application works. 

If your driver had a double order (picking up 2 orders from the same restaurant or picking up 2 orders from different restaurant) the driver app prioritizes the order that was placed first. If the driver does not complete each delivery within the allowed delivery window their metrics reduce and they may be penalized . The driver app does not make it  intuitive to see the address of the second order. (Requires 4 clicks, and manually typing the address into their GPS, can't copy/paste...it's a waste of time.) The driver could use the Jump to Task feature to manually switch to the second order...but this feature is a bit hidden in the app, and not many Dashers, especially new ones know about it). 

Perhaps this is why that Dasher passed your house, he had no clue where you lived until he finished the other order. Blame the app for it's inefficiencies..."
2021-05-15 15:41:13,wallstreetbets,Please ELI5
2021-05-15 15:07:12,wallstreetbets,Prints welfare chqs maybe.  Door dash has enough marketing power to run 5 percent of the market share it will profit a lil . These fees will be regulated and the services that offer consistent delivery will profit. The real subtraction is restaurants won't hire drivers as much. Why would they have a guy that aligns to thier demand for a driver

2021-05-15 19:51:18,wallstreetbets,"DoorDash has no 2FA by default. My account got hacked and someone spent $100 at a burger place then tipped the driver $90. I called support and cancelled the order less than 5 minutes after it was placed and they refunded $100 in credits and told me too bad on the $90, there’s nothing they can do about it. While I’m still on the phone with support, the hacker spends all the credits at a Walgreens. This is all happening in a state I’ve never been to. I had them cancel that order too and close my account. I asked for a refund again and they said “you have the credits already”. I just closed my account, I don’t want credits, I want my money back. The guy on the phone asked if I wanted to reopen the account to get the credits! No dude, your security is obviously shite. I use a different PW for all my accounts. Then he said it was impossible to change credits to a refund. 

I filed a chargeback with my bank and it was successful after a month, I got the entire $190 back. Fuck DoorDash and their shitty ass everything. I had spent thousands on their app for food delivery during covid too and that’s the support I get. I hope they get shorted to oblivion and die a painful death."

2021-05-15 18:02:49,wallstreetbets,"Most likely, they will buy up the shares. The play is that the supply at the end of lockup increases and demand isn’t there so the price drops.

* and the ape here wins. 

That’s assuming the investment bank that’s working with Ddash let’s that happen. If they take up the lack in demand by buying up the supply, share price shouldn’t drop that bad and keeps up afloat while others try to buy and thus increasing price.

* ape here loses

Supply/Demand"

2021-05-15 16:52:26,wallstreetbets,"$60 trading commission?  Are you kidding me?  We haven’t had those since the 80’s, and that was along the lines of a Merrill Lynch commission.  If I recall correctly, I paid $25/trade from some no-name brokerage back then.  

So basically, is this one of the gleaming examples of Socialism up there in Canada?  Sounds like the brokerage cabal has sufficiently paid off government to solidify exhorbitant trading commissions, with no sense of competition amongst them to drive down costs.  I’d appreciate your viewpoint on the topic.  

Even the most ardent of US “anti-capitalists” on these Reddit boards would revolt if told they had to pay even $20/trade!"

If he owns 10% of the company and selling 2% of the 10% stake it’s not much(I would be more worried about McKenzie telling people to short before selling out of the position just to cuck Jeff). You can also see the gaps and points in which he is selling if you ever track aftermarket activity. Amazon is a ticker I actively track. Feel free to lmk if I’m missing anything.

2021-05-15 14:46:56,wallstreetbets,"JD's earnings are inflated by their numerous spinoffs this past year. If you remove those and look at their underlying operations, they're closer to a P/E of 40/50"

2021-05-15 15:06:57,wallstreetbets,"You're right about the events being non-recurring. However, they retain a great majority stake in the spin-offs which are apparently profitable and desirable. I don't think the succesful spin-offs are bearish..

Also I don't think your numbers regarding profit margins or your PE approximation are correct but exaggerated. Their profit margin is currently about 4x that of JD. I think the chance that JD improves their margin is greater than baba improving theirs."

2021-05-15 18:22:44,wallstreetbets,"That's why I'm saying you should just adjust the earnings. I'm not saying you should discount their assets (you still need to see whether or not they are what the market values them however), which is where their stakes in their spinoffs will show up in the future. 

Also, I'm looking at operating margins over gross margins. Operating margin gives a better look at the company's operations because it takes into account stuff like payroll and overhead. JD's 2020 operating margin was on the high side of 1-2% and Alibaba's was 18% or so. I definitely agree with you that JD, in all likelihood, has more room to improve their margins than Alibaba drastically in the long term. I don't believe this will occur for the next couple of years, however. Unlike the US or Europe, the e-commerce marketplace in China is very competitive. JD's model of buying goods and reselling them also differs from Alibaba who operates more as an intermediary between buyers and sellers.

Edit: Mind you I'm long both, but at these prices I am heavily prefer to add to my Alibaba stake using covered puts"
2021-05-15 18:36:43,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the context. Looking at operating margins makes sense. I'm also long in both. Your perspective has made me want to do more research. I want to increase my position in one or both but was leaning JD. What do you think of the CCP antitrust investigation? JD has been able to stay out of it (so far).
2021-05-15 18:56:41,wallstreetbets,"I think it won't have any material impact on Alibaba's operations, the main investigation was concluded with the 2.4b fine. 
What the CCP might still do is:
1. Force BABA to divest it's media assets
2. More Ant group regulation (news finally seems to be turning positive from state media).

What the CCP will not do is:
1. Nationalize Alibaba
2. Specifically target Alibaba further 

You'll rarely find bargains in the market that have a clear cut bullish case. The key to picking winners, in my opinion, is to pick out the companies with negative headlines that will continue to have strong bottom and top lines even if the worst **realistic** scenario comes to pass. I will say, JD seems to be far better at managing the political landscape in China than Alibaba and that can definitely have a material impact on operations. They seem to be voluntarily divesting it's non-core assets without pressure from the CCP, as if to get ahead on things."
2021-05-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Main Reasons why I would INVEST in $BCRX before Q2 ER In this article I will shortly explain the main reasons why I would buy BCRX before the Q2 EarningsReport. In case you're looking for some deeper DD, I suggest you check out the other [BCRX DD article](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtzhp2/bcrx_dd_the_embarrassment_of_riches/) I wrote.

&#x200B;

* **2021 Q1 ER Beat**

On May the 6th, 2021 BCRX presented Q1 Earnings Report data which managed  ***Beat Analysts estimates***. Basically what matters from this ***Q1 ER*** is that it was the ***launch of Orladeyo***, and Analysts wanted to see a decent amount of money generated by it. They were expecting Orladeyo sales to top ***$3.1MM*** and Orladeyo actually generated ***$10.94MM***, this is a ***353% sales beat***

https://preview.redd.it/uppmf8dy09z61.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=7215a9fc3d12ae2ead2bb782802742ef8ab998cb

The consequence of the ER beat was an increase of **24.06%** in the **SP**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3dhmebmo39z61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8876fcc6c02233d347ec7bab257ef079d5ea74e6

&#x200B;

It's *really important* to mention that **revenues generated this Q1** only came from the **USA**.

This **Q2 Orladeyo** has been **approved in Japan/Europe/UK** aswell, adding new sources of revenue.

&#x200B;

**Orladeyo sales** are expected to **grow exponentially** each quarter. Main reason for it is that it has been approved in the countries mentioned above. The other reason is that the amount of patients they treat will slowly score up as insurance companies allow their clients to be treated with this drug.

&#x200B;

The data displayed below shows the amount of patients using Orladeyo in 3 or 4 pharmacies which provide information to Bloomberg. This numbers help us to have an idea of how Orladeyo is doing in terms of gaining new patients, but it's not 100% accurate.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qw97n7ga89z61.png?width=1257&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d353dc8fe919da2f4e10d6c5f68527c7cb7813b

If we sum up the numbers from the Q1 we get a total of 43 patients, in the first month of Q2 there are 38 new patients already, meaning Orladeyo nearly managed to get in a single month all the amount of patients it gathered in the Q1, reasuring the exponential growth. This numbers will keep rising now that Orladeyo is approved in additional countries.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **Orladeyo**™ **(Berotralstat) oral pill**

&#x200B;

Basically Biocryst has a drug called Orladeyo, which is the first Oral approved treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with hereditary angioedema (HAE). It is estimated that HAE affects 1 in 50,000 people.

&#x200B;

Orladeyo was firstly approved in the ***USA*** ***December the 3rd,*** ***2020. Q4***

Orladeyo received ***Japan*** NHI price listing approval ***April the 14th, 2021. Q2***

Orladeyo received ***Europe*** approval ***April the 30th, 2021 Q2***

Orladeyo received ***UK*** approval ***May the 12th, 2021 Q2***

&#x200B;

Orladeyo is [ranked](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/20-most-expensive-prescription-drugs-in-2021.html) the **#13 most expensive drug** in the USA market. The price shown below **$37,308** is approximately what patients must monthly pay to access the drug.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/68per70ny8z61.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=9146f6c55c4280ab48b5af36f4a46edaa603807c

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **USA**

&#x200B;

In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, ***7500 diagnosed and treated,*** 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over[ 41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for ***3,075 patients.***

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/arh13tkub9z61.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cfb70508321842a2123cb2b4fc586343e28dc94

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to **485,000$**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **Japan**

&#x200B;

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with ***Torii Pharmaceuticals.*** A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to ***at*** ***least reach 500 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to ***$248,500***

***Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment*** from Torii.

***BioCryst will receive*** tiered royalties ranging from ***20% - 40% of Japanese sales.***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **Europe**

&#x200B;

It's estimated to be around ***12,000 HAE patients in Europe.*** Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of ***4,920 patients*** in Europe.

Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's ***$248,500/year.*** This number should soon be confirmed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results.

&#x200B;

***USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$***

***Japan - 500p x 248,5K  = 124,250,000$***

***EU - 4,920p x 248,5K = 1,222,620,000$***

&#x200B;

Summing it all up we get $2,751,270,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of ***$2,628,170,000***. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma.

&#x200B;

Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating ***$2,628,170,000*** a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier **x7**. We get a total of ***$18,397,190,000*** meaning an increase of  ***$104,46***  in the stock price.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***CEO himself confirmed*** multiple times that the company will ***not need to do offerings anymore.*** As shown in the pic below, current cash runaway takes them into 2023.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3xehgeq9k9z61.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=74a81e11b1817c7978f786ec3bd159ef52534484

&#x200B;

* **Conclusion**

We are just about to witness how ***BCRX evolves*** from being a small-cap company to being a high-cap one. This will mainly happen due to the ***revenue generated by Orladeyo*** and the ***potential of BCX9930.***

Basically from now on each ER will be a new catalyst for BCRX. Considering how Orladeyo is still in an early launch state the revenue it generates will exponentially keep growing, so will the SP.

***Orladeyo*** undoubtly is an awesome asset for BCRX, a ***cash-cow***. But the one drug in BCRX's pipeline that has the ***most promising future is BCX9930***. An Oral inhibitor in PH3 which treats ***8 different diseases*** as of now, aimming for a potential ***40B market size by 2025***. Deeper information about it can be found in the following article [BCRX - The Embarrassment of Riches](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtzhp2/bcrx_dd_the_embarrassment_of_riches/).

I currently do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range. In my opinion BCRX probably has the best safe/reward ratio in the bio-world and I do not plan to sell my shares yet."

**Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon/UFOs \[and how to capitalize on them!!!\]**

Momentum has been building across the world for greater disclosure of government knowledge into UAP’s (Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon) after the New York Times released it’s bombshell coverage of encounters by 3 Navy pilots in 2017 and 2019 each reporting to have seen technology that defies the limits of physics with capabilities that far exceed that of any known assets in US, Russian or Chinese arsenals. Manoeuvres that have been witnessed include rapid deacceleration (high velocity to a sudden stop, then hover); sharp angle, high velocity low angle turns (right angles or sharper); low altitude trans medium travel (submerged craft lifting and flying from water, and the reverse); high altitude trans medium travel (craft dropping from above 80,000 ft then coming to a hover at 30,000 ft, and the reverse); high velocity travel (Mach 10+ or near instantaneous); non aerodynamic aircraft design (cubes, pyramids, cylinders, disks, acorns, top hats) and propulsion systems that do not function off of exothermic thrust based physics (no thermal heat trail). Pressure has been building on the Pentagon to release what it knows, which has since resulted in the declassification of those videos and confirmation by the Pentagon that they are authentic as well as new mandates outlined in the 2021 COVID relief bill mandating full government disclosure by June 2021. The Pentagon has also publicly announced the creation of a new UFO taskforce and has been giving closed door briefings to members of the Senate and Congress, including the Senate Intelligence Committee, on these incursions into American airspace. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has long fought for funding and disclosure and recently when asked the question “so are you saying there’s information that the public hasn’t seen on the subject”; he responded, “what I’m telling you is that the public hasn’t seen most of the information”.

As recently as two weeks ago, new videos and pictures have been leaked of UAP’s flying in formation over US battle squadrons which include captured images of acorn and pyramid shaped craft hovering at distance. The frequency of these incursions has also been alarming, prompting several Atlantic based Airforce bases to issue warnings to their pilots of unknown objects in their airspace ahead of every exercise. Radar technicians aboard the aircraft carrier “Nimitz” describe seeing these objects at such a high frequency and in such high numbers that on some days they were described as “falling out of the sky”. Additional alarm has been raised by other members of the military as the frequency of sightings also seems to correlate with proximity to nuclear facilities including missile silos, aircraft carriers and submarines, with senior officials in charge of these facilities describing anomalies in launch sequences that appear to be intentional. These concerns are what prompted Christopher Lemon, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence along with Luis Elizondo, former director of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (ATTIP) at the Pentagon to leak the videos to the New York Times.

Speculation of UFO’s dates back to World War II where pilots regularly observed bright lights in the sky that would track them into battles. At the time, these unknown objects were referred to as “Foo Fighters” but were later termed UFO’s (Unidentified Flying Objects) after the public became enthralled in the crash at Roswell where the government announced it was in possession of an alien aircraft and subsequently retracted the story the following day. Public interest was further garnered in the 1980’s when a military contractor, Bob Lazar, who worked as a physicist on advanced propulsion systems came forward with information that he had worked on 9 crafts in government possession at a military black site called S-4 that matched the descriptions and performance capabilities of the UFO’s described by pilots. This base was later known as Area 51 and has captured the publics imagination ever since.

In 2001, a group of concerned senior military leadership and citizens held the first attempt at public disclosure, hosting the Citizens Disclosure Project in front of a panel of several sitting US Senators. While momentum again began to build, that momentum was quickly quashed by the events of September 11 and public interest and only just begun to resurface.

**Invest in otherworldly opportunities – Procure Space ETF (UFO)**

UFO has captured the minds of space-themed investing since its inception date April 10, 2019. It has performed remarkably in-line with peers when benchmarked against the S&P 1500 Industrials Index as of May 12, 2021. As with many funds of its vintage the crash of March’20 effectively served as a stress test to the financial health of its component companies, which it passed with flying colours, achieving almost a full retracement (the fund only recorded a loss in value of 3.64%, from $26.37 to $25.41, which was improved by a further 1% from dividends earned during the period). Post-2020, similar space-ETFs have launched in 2021 in advance of an anticipated flood of investor funds into this emerging sector as Morgan Stanley estimates the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion of more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. With roughly half of that increase expected to come from satellite broadband, UFO is well positioned to benefit from this influx of capital with 40.71% of fund allocation comprised of a mix of both orbital and surface communication companies.

**Why UFO? What’s the play here?**

Former Democratic Majority Leader and Nevada Senator Harry Reid, as well as other notable ufologists, have long claimed that defence contractor Lockheed Martin may have had fragments of a crashed UFO in its possession. Many claim that possession of the UFO material is what not only inspired the shapes of many skunkworks aircraft but led to multiple breakthroughs in materials research and stealth technology. Employees at Lockheed have gone so far as to make eyewitness reports of alien sightings and direct interactions. More broadly speaking, any admission by the government of extra-terrestrials will naturally be met with fear, and the simple play here is to place a long trade on defense and aerospace of which UFO has a significant composition (with an allocation of 27.19%, including major Pentagon contractors Raytheon, Northrop and Boeing). Should the evidence provided be less than conclusive interest in UFO the ETF is expected to increase at the bare minimum both from direct key term searches (literally the letters “UFO”), searches by retail investors surrounding related investment opportunities, and even more generally through social media sentiment. The uptick in interest should naturally lead to an increase in volume traded in popular aerospace and defense stocks, most of which are held by the fund. Defense stocks are a popular benefactor in times of global uncertainty and the sudden interest back to space is likely to exacerbate existing trends toward the militarization of space and a resurgence of Cold War between leading world powers (notably between the US, China and Russia, see this article in Politico below). Increased investment into satellite communications is also an expected knock-on effect as countries will be focused on boosting their “ears and eyes in the skies” (see below article from C4ISRNET).

-invented something that could make F-22 or F-35 look like a paper plane and created UFO propaganda to hide it

-they co-operate with aliens somehow, aliens came down, check how close we are to nuke the fuck out ourselves and then go back, 

if they really did reverse-engineered UFO into something like TR-3B (mythical unknown classified aircraft with extreme capabilities) then these defense companies could profit very, very well...

if Bob Lazar speaks the truth, it's only a matter of time

remember, we know as much as they allow us to know, if they could keep F-117 classified for a couple decades, they surely could do the same with this UFO crafts. (F-117 was firstly introduced to the world when they shot it down first time over Serbia I believe)"

# Yes market is opened tomorrow. ***5/17 Outlook

Am tired ape.

# SPY 5/14 - BULLISH

* We gapped up this morning above 410 to the 412-413 vol trigger and almost filled the gap as suggested as a possibility last night.
* We hit 15.3 price target and .11 away from upper price target from this morning post.
* **We found resistance at the top of the gap line @ 417.49 range.**
* **Bulls need to hold 415 - 412 - 410 (Below 410 and I'll be neutral - bearish)**
* **Bulls need push through 417.8 resistance.**
* **Bears need hold 417.8 or gap down to 415 test support and fill the 413-410 gap between vol trigger and gamma strike.**

# SPY RSI

Even though we are near oversold on the 1 day timeframe, we still have some room to run.

* Note the 91.5 top in beginning of April. Currently we are at about 70
* **We are still technically trending down on the RSI so we need to break the the 70 oversold line and hit 77 - 81 - 91 range for ATH.**
* **However, this could indicate some downside early next week before more upside, possibly later in the week. Keep an eye on it :)**

2021-05-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why concrete companies are going to be the next meme stocks Alright so I'm sure you've heard of Biden's proposed 2.3T American Jobs Plan, fixing and creating vital infrastructure for the US economy while at the same time employing thousands for work. Out of this Bill, there is around 621B allocated for transportation.


Here is a quote from the White House's website about allocation:



*""Repair American roads and bridges. One in five miles, or 173,000 total miles, of our highways and major roads are in poor condition, as well as 45,000 bridges. Delays caused by traffic congestion alone cost over $160 billion per year, and motorists are forced to pay over $1,000 every year in wasted time and fuel. The President is proposing a total increase of $115 billion to modernize the bridges, highways, roads, and main streets that are in most critical need of repair. This includes funding to improve air quality, limit greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce congestion. His plan will modernize 20,000 miles of highways, roads, and main streets, not only “fixing them first” but “fixing them right,” with safety, resilience, and all users in mind. It will fix the most economically significant large bridges in the country in need of reconstruction, and it will repair the worst 10,000 smaller bridges, including bridges that provide critical connections to rural and tribal communities. The plan includes $20 billion to improve road safety for all users, including increases to existing safety programs and a new Safe Streets for All program to fund state and local “vision zero” plans and other improvements to reduce crashes and fatalities, especially for cyclists and pedestrians""*


This will be the largest infrastructure plan since FDR released the New Deal, nearly 100 years later. 173,000 miles of concrete, 45,000 bridges made of... You guess it, concrete. 

With 621B up for grabs thats going into a product that gets manufactured, bought, sold and which companies issue shares for this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to hop on the concrete and cement train.


Now, this still has to get passed through congress. Along side with the American Families Plan, this a MUCH easier sell for republicans. 1.8T for the American Families Plan, 2.3T for the American Jobs Plan to a whopping total of 4.1T in spending. The funny thing is, out of the 4.1T the least contentious part is the 621B for infrastructure. This is actually [what](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/what-to-watch-for-in-congressional-debate-on-biden-economic-plan) republicans **want.**


Free education for four years? Tough sell.

Direct support to families and children? We'll see

Senior care and wage hikes? Good luck.

Infrastructure to repair roads, bridges and infrastructure using American made products by hiring American workers? **SIGN US UP** 

Even if its less than 621B, say what gets agreed on is 450B, I guarantee you out of anything in the entire two plans, the infrastructure will go through.



How to play this:

Load up on concrete. Firms and funds have already been doing this quietly in the background. Look at $PAVE, the US Infrastructure Development ETF. Since Biden was elected, its been on an escalator ride up. I believe this escalator will turn into an elevator soon enough, especially when the Dems and the Republicans get an appetite for all the sweet sweet gray concrete and black asphalt.  


So you can either go the ETF route or hop into individual companies.


Some of the top US Concrete companies:

CRH Oldcastle

**CX** - My favorite

Lafarge

US Concrete


CX is what I'm currently holding, got in around $6.50. I personally think anything under $10 is a steal. I think these are all going to run hot in the next few weeks with chatter around the two bills. Their revenue last quarter beast estimates by over 1000%. You read that right. They are perfectly positioned to take in a big chunk of this government spending. Look what they focus on:



*""CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V., together with its subsidiaries, produces, markets, distributes, and sells cement, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, clinker, and other construction materials worldwide. The company also offers various complementary construction products, including asphalt products; concrete blocks; roof tiles; architectural products; concrete pipes for storm and sanitary sewers applications; and other precast products, such as rail products, concrete floors, box culverts, bridges, drainage basins, barriers, and parking curbs.""*


That is exactly what we are looking for from a company who will profit over this bill.

I currently have a mixture of shares and options in CX, every time there is a dip I buy more. Including this last week. I wouldnt be surprised if this stock runs up to $15 when the final approval sets. 

At the time I wrote this article, CX is trading at $8.34. I don't believe we will ever see another bill this large with the sole purpose of infrastructure. Like I said, Franklin Roosevelt had his Infrastructure Plan approved almost 100 years ago. Don't miss this train."
2021-05-14 21:19:00,wallstreetbets,Post your positions gay bear
2021-05-14 22:02:11,wallstreetbets,"I work in the concrete industry, and I can safely say we are fucked right now. In fact last week I placed puts on cemex, us concrete, and Vulcan materials. 

There are cement supply chain issues, fly ash shortages, driver shortages, price increases, more bounced checks from customers right now, and orders have been consistently slowing down. 

Would recommend the exact opposite of this."
2021-05-14 23:06:27,wallstreetbets,"Good luck to you, however as a civil engineer I can tell you we don't use concrete to repair bridges and roads.

Building bridges from scratch yes a shit ton of concrete, but not for repair. Also repair is a pretty vague term - could range from anything to replacing bridge bearings, replacing expansion joints, correcting alignment or settlement issues, embankment grades etc.

Modernizing safety aspects of roads and bridges include upgrading/installing steel guardrail, crash barriers, cameras, message board signs, revising speed limits, visibility issues. etc

Don't confuse repair with construction.

*This includes funding to improve air quality, limit greenhouse gas emissions...*

Concrete is a huge producer of carbon dioxide emissions during manufacturing so that would be pretty ironic...

If you know any asphalt manufactures that may be a better play as repairing roads involves relaying sections of asphalt and filling in pot holes.

If you want to try to make money off this then look at companies who do contract work for Highway Departments i.e **civil engineering companies/contractors** and **companies engaged in the production and distribution of construction equipment and materials** like asphalt, gravel, stone, sand, cranes, trucks, etc.

CX fits into this category so looks like a decent play."

2021-05-15 09:01:07,wallstreetbets,"Most highways are made of asphalt.

Most bridges are made from steel.

Bridge repair may include foundational repair but mostly it will be steel work and painting.

If anything this is a steel bull case for Vitards.  Steel for bridges, steel reinforcing for foundations, and steel reinforcing for concrete sections of highways.

I think the big case for concrete will be new schools and other building projects."

2021-05-15 10:37:34,wallstreetbets,Problem is the infrastructure bill had very little in genuine infrastructure funding. It was so much slush/pork/stretching of the term infrastructure that I would be surprised if a single dollar fixes any road or bridge.

This definitely isn’t a typical WSB FD play. But this is certainly a longer play, buy some decent delta LEAPS and wait. I see this similarly to playing steel. Even without an infrastructure bill being passed, it’s a hard asset which is gonna do well with inflation coming. The issue arises if they decide to spike interest rates because that could cause things to pull back hard. If I can free up some funds I’ll be looking into some CX 1/22 ITM calls, already long on 2 different steel plays, so I’ll most likely take the gamble on this as well"

2021-05-15 11:21:28,wallstreetbets,"Fly ash is used to substitute for cement (usually around 20% or so) it comes from the leftover residue from producing coal. They have nowhere to really dispose of it so they turn it into fly ash, stick it in concrete, say it’s “green” for using your job as a way to dispose of it, and call it a day. 

When used in the right quantities it improves strength slightly, but also is harder to finish (sticks to the trowels more)"
2021-05-15 11:23:02,wallstreetbets,"So, when it runs out... people don’t get credit for “green” building materials which can be used for tax subsidies. 

In addition the most costly part of concrete is the cement by far. 

So the cost of the concrete itself goes up when you can’t use fly ash anymore."

The current president, sadly, is a confused, deteriorating old man, that probably doesn't make any decisions. Feeble, weak, and caving to the extreme left. I've always considered myself a democrat, but the last 6 years have been completely retarded. People suffering from Trump derangement syndrome are completely blind to what has happened to our rights, and will gladly vote for elite, criminal, career politicians out of hate - instead of what is objectively best. The same people are all butt-hurt now that the CDC said people who have gotten the shot don't need to wear masks. There was literally an anchor on CNN crying yesterday. Twitter screenshots of people saying they will always wear their mask so they don't get confused with conservatives.

I kinda stepped back from the concrete side of things in my company and focused on drilling now but keep watching Croell creep up north.  Won’t doubt they go back to owatonna and make their portable there a permanent fixture.


Most the quarries around mason city and north Iowa are owned by yohn and niss or other private companies.  Cemstone is kinda stalling out in down in Iowa."

They've got the worst balance sheet of all of them by far along with the smallest growth prospects, but you can bet a years salary that if someone's talking about steel, theyre gonna bring up US Steel anyway lol (and to be clear, it will (and has) gone up lol)

2021-05-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Huya: The most undervalued company in the market. https://i.imgur.com/dVC4QND.jpg

What is Huya? 

Huya is the largest game streaming platform in all of China, it’s basically the Chinese equivalent of Twitch. 

Esports is absolutely huge in China, bigger than in the west, it’s like a real sport over there. They hold tourneys in giant $900m stadiums and offer substantial cash prizes to winners. This is an industry with strong tailwinds and we know there will only be massive growth for the foreseeable future.

The majority shareholder of Huya is Tencent, which is great news for Huya because they can buy exclusive streaming rights for all Tencent games like League of Legends and Dota2 as well as exclusive broadcast rights for tournaments, which is creating a very nice moat. Add the network effect and you can forget about anyone ever challenging Huya’s dominance in the industry. We all know Google and Microsoft could never even compete with Twitch despite sniping the largest streamers Ninja and Shroud, because the network effect for game streaming is just that strong.

So what makes Huya so undervalued?

Well, just look at these goddamn numbers:

Market Cap: $4b

Sales: $1.67b

P/S: 2.4

PE ratio: 28

PEG ratio: 0.3

2020 Revenue growth: 30%

2020 Earnings growth: 89%

5 yr revenue cagr: 20-30%

Cash: $1.6b

Debt: $0

Compare these with a somewhat similar company, Bilibili, the Youtube of China.

Market cap: $37b

Sales: $1.8b

P/S: 20.5

PE ratio: 0

PEG ratio: 0

2020 revenue growth: 50%

2020 earnings growth: -118%

5 yr revenue cagr: 35-45%

Cash: $2b

Debt: $1.29b

But why?

Huya has been hit with the perfect storm of bullshit. We all know tech and growth stocks are crashing right now because of inflation, add the fact that Chinese stocks are getting hammered right now because of the new regulations that threaten to delist some of the shadier Chinese companies out there. But that’s not all, there is something else holding this stock down, a pending merger with their largest competitor Douyu.

This potential merger would basically double Huya revenue instantly, double the cash on the balance sheet, while giving them a new market cap of roughly $7b, and they would instantly capture 80% of all game streaming market share in China. Basically a monopoly in a hyper growth industry. They could also increase margins substantially with no competition and no need to outbid competitors with large contracts to their streamers to keep them on the platform.

Under normal circumstances this potential merger would be the most bullish development of all time, but not today. The CCP really doesn’t like it. They don’t like Tencent buying up smaller companies within an industry, merging them together, and creating a monopoly. These days it seems like there is an article every day about how the Chinese government is really starting to crack down on Tencent and Alibaba. The Huya Douyu deal is at the center of all of that China stock FUD, and there is a real good chance that this merger gets blocked outright within the next month or two.

Then Huya is screwed? 

Not really. Whatever happens, it’s good for Huya share price. Right now Huya is one of the most shorted stocks in the market. There are a large number of shorts looking to take advantage of the price difference between Huya and Douyu shares, Arbitrage shorts. They will have to cover either way once the merger decision is reached, leaving Huya to run higher once the merger FUD is over. Over time, Huya will rise to reflect the strong fundaments and growth of the company. 

This stock should be 5x the price it is today at a bare minimum.

What am I doing?

I’m buying LEAPs all the way down, averaging in from the start of this week. I’m up to 90 already and buying many more hopefully before it shoots up.

2021-05-15 14:54:45,wallstreetbets,"recent positive last few months: china has recognized eSports as a legitimate occupation, reversing trends of cracking down on internet addiction. lot of build out of eSports facilities in major cities.

negatives: competition, bilibili growing at faster rate, people seem to prefer it to huya; growth outside china seems limited - nimo tv 60% of revenue from brazil, twitch already big there. share count has more than doubled in last five years.

if merger goes through I see bilibili moving to shore up its anime niche. I'm thinking that's why it sold LoL rights. if it falls through more competition seems likely - bilibili, kuaishou.

I'm long. seems dirt cheap. looking for holes in bull thesis. rapid bilibili growth plus push into eSports seems largest to me. welcome perspectives on perception or reputation of huya in china."

2021-05-15 15:02:42,wallstreetbets,I’m not worried about Bilibili at all. To me this is a perfect parallel of when Youtube rolled out their streaming features and some people said this would kill Twitch. Since then Youtube and Twitch have only gone on to grow and Twitch’s dominance has never been remotely challenged. Douyu is the only legitimate competitor to Huya imo and the fight between them threatens margin expansion until there is only one left standing.
2021-05-15 15:30:09,wallstreetbets,RE-inversed
2021-05-14 23:58:01,wallstreetbets,"I really like Douyu. Its nearly as undervalued as Huya if you take the merger out of the equation. It will probably have a sharp drop in the near term if the merger fails, which is a real possibility."
2021-05-15 07:06:24,wallstreetbets,These calls led you to the conclusion that huya is not worth the risk atm?
2021-05-15 15:28:03,wallstreetbets,"It is in the same position as BABA. Right now all eyes are on this Huya Douyu merger to see if China will slap down Tencent from creating essentially a game streaming monopoly. That’s why the share price is so low at the moment, a ton of uncertainty about the future of this company. That’s also why it’s time to buy, no matter what happens the market has already priced in worse than the worst case scenario here."
2021-05-15 18:43:20,wallstreetbets,"Yes, Huya has started to expand internationally with their NimoTV app. They are currently operating in 10 countries in South East Asia and South America. Competitor Douyu has already expanded into Japan, if the merger manages to go through that is another thing to consider. I am bullish that they will eventually capture a large market share in South East Asia, however, they are facing stiff competition with Twitch in South America currently. It is also worth noting that none of their international revenue is enough to move the needle and likely won’t for years to come."

2021-05-14 22:34:57,wallstreetbets,"I agree. Look at how many companies smashed earnings and plummeted, not even Chinese. We are in a major fud market, every pop gets sold down. I plan to average in and buy more LEAPS if it drops."

Pandemic is essentially over or will be over in the Western world with the poorer countries targeted next for vaccine rollout. There is a lot of pent up travel demand and summer is coming. Airlines are recovering and ordering more planes and predicting travel will fully rebound by 2025 or sooner.

Hey what company has been doubly fucked by pandemic and shitty plane design and is trading at a massive dip and historic discount and below fair value and price target, yes you guessed it $BA. The pandemic is reaching it's end and the max 8 has been certified to by FAA to fly again. BA is delivering planes again. $BA is poised for massive rebound.

Hell $BA even soared to $280 dollars a month ago on plane deliveries before the electrical wire issue tanked the stock again. With the electrical wiring resolved and max 8 deliveries resuming buying $BA at this level is a steal and if it recovers to former levels will be well above $400 in the future. Remember   Boeing is part of duopoly and travel is poised to be in the next sector rotation.

TLDR: 

Buy $BA, shares if you want to be safe,  monthly options for leverage

 77 x 08/20 $250 BA calls, plan to add more"

\- BA closed and is selling its old HQ property south of Seattle and made ++++ other cost reductions during pandy

\- possible that airlines retired / will retired older planes less efficient planes, now will buy more efficient higher tech new planes to replace.  

Other downside:

SpaceX scooped up hordes of BA talent a few years back when BA cut a bunch of people, now SpaceX is kicking BA's ass in space and BA will struggle to compete.

2021-05-14 23:08:56,wallstreetbets,"I think the advantage Boeing and LMT will have in this space race will be manufacturing. 

Once you take away all the bullshit and posturing, this is something these companies are capable of.

Elon Musk has been struggling for quite some time to manufacture sedans on a large scale. I’m skeptical. 

Sorry forgot to say also, totally agree with your assessments of this especially the retiring of old birds in many airlines fleet respectively. 

Covid essentially took every 747 and A380 out of the sky for commercial at least. I don’t see how the orders for triple 7 - X won’t be massive."

2021-05-15 01:57:09,wallstreetbets,Lots of unusual options bullish flow on boeing calls. Hope is there is some juicy good insider information floating around.
2021-05-14 20:50:00,wallstreetbets,"This isn't my life savings. And yes the stock market does have risks, surprise pussy. I thought this was wallstreetbets. BA could go down but I believe it has potential for good leveraged gains. This is a small yolo. I do plan on cutting position as it gains."
2021-05-14 23:14:32,wallstreetbets,"Both of those scenarios would be horrible for practically anyone with money in the market. 

This makes zero sense as a perspective on trading.

Oh you bought stock in bullets? What if there’s world peace?

A 250C on Boeing Aeronautics? That’s like the fucking least risky Call option I’ve ever seen discussed in this sub. Gtfo."
2021-05-14 20:27:50,wallstreetbets,Neither does Boeing to be fair
2021-05-15 00:36:42,wallstreetbets,"""I think the advantage Boeing and LMT will have in this space race will be manufacturing.""

Possibly.  I was skeptical about TSLA too but they seem to be solving problems and improving.  The had a pretty major scale up.  They f'd their scale up because they deployed too many untested technologies on the way up.  That it makes it hard to find the probs bcz you don't know what's actually working and what's not.  Elon will learn from that and be better on the next run."
2021-05-15 01:06:58,wallstreetbets,">manufacturing

Outsourced and offshored, my man. Think ""global supply chain"" because thats what BCA embodies. Assemblers are cheaper labor than machinists.  BDS may be another story, but that's only like 40% of their revenue."
2021-05-14 22:30:21,wallstreetbets,"Slowly, yeah, sure.   They'd be stupid not to.  The cost of living here is retarded and politically WA is very union friendly.

Full HQ moved to Chicago years ago.  The Renton campus was a regional HQ, ppl are moving to production sites.

787 production has been shifted to SC & 747 line is winding up, so all that's left at Everett is 767, 777 ,777x.  It's not clear where the next plane will be built but IMO they should be looking at opening a new plant in a RTW state.

EDIT: forgot they have engineering offices all over the world already."
2021-05-14 20:45:21,wallstreetbets,Lockup expiry next week. Wonder it will go down or not. Want to add few more

2021-05-15 01:13:03,wallstreetbets,"Margin on these planes is gonna suck though due to storage and maintenance costs. They're burning cash like crazy and will continue to do so until they reduce inventory, probably the rest of the year."
2021-05-14 20:28:07,wallstreetbets,100% technical nothing against BA I love it and it will take out its old high above $450
2021-05-15 12:29:14,wallstreetbets,Never heard of it
2021-05-15 02:06:25,wallstreetbets,Before their troubles boeing has some good margins at least much better than airlines. Boeing won't be in this shitty position forever and and stock prices are forward looking.
2021-05-15 00:20:01,wallstreetbets,Boeing is a national treasure though.
2021-05-15 00:54:13,wallstreetbets,"I felt that way initially but it seems as though all the successes Tesla has had moving production to China was for not.

The same appears to be true for Boeing. Most of these instruments and potentiometers that are malfunctioning on the Max jet are from Chinese outsourcing. I was disappointed that Calhoun didn’t come to his senses regarding this or better yet, step down. 

I’m still extremely bullish on Boeing obviously Airbus offers practically no competition in wide body and as you mentioned, many airlines have retired aging steel from their long haul fleet presenting an amazing acquisition opportunity for Boeing for the new Triple 7.

As far as single isle narrow body, I think Airbus is highly competitive. It’s a bit of a toss up with the max. 

A lot of what you mentioned before I also agree with. Boeing has certainly damaged its relationship with the talent pool as well as the pentagon over the last 10 years. Simply put, I think it’s Calhouns fault and he should move aside."
2021-05-15 01:26:30,wallstreetbets,Not even close. Any of it.
2021-05-15 15:53:28,wallstreetbets,Probably for the best
2021-05-15 08:43:35,wallstreetbets,"They did get the air force 1 contract. 
The technicals say it’s a buy too"
2021-05-15 01:04:49,wallstreetbets,"Well you seem to know more about than I do, I don't follow either company closely.  Boing is big news here since it's the last place in WA state where a working dude can get decent pay, but they do seem, smartly in my opinion, to be gunning to get the hell out of here as much as they can.

I have 20 Boing.  I thought about adding some today but I can't remember if I did or not!  Ha!  I'm a dumbass!  I added to DKNG and NET positions instead."
2021-05-15 01:24:33,wallstreetbets,"Well, I myself, am a union member and I’m tempted to disagree with that notion. Again Calhoun. Chinese labor has been a negative. The fucking plane crashed. The South Carolina factories, again a negative, mediocre talent. 

You can’t make an Airplane with a bunch of bums. Its not a bootleg griddle or some hairdryer you can order off of Amazon. This is serious. How are we at risk of losing to Airbus? Because we’re slowly adopting a manufacturing model for sneakers but for 200 million dollar aircrafts. 

I’ll suspend my Calhoun diatribe.

I bought Draftkings as a spac and cloudflare at ipo. Still holding Draftkings, but I sold cloudflare. Hard to justify the price imo but I’m usually wrong.

Worth considering BA and LMT imo."
2021-05-15 10:45:14,wallstreetbets,"The cost of living is pretty expensive but it’s probably less of a concern for the company. Upper management is more concerned about profit, and UM sees union workers as eating away at their margins. Despite being one of the OG companies to have massive tax cuts from WA state government to keep the jobs here."
2021-05-15 11:19:56,wallstreetbets,"Well whatever their contribution to building airplanes, I'm often at a loss to explain the union position.  Frequently they've been their own worst enemies because they refuse to recognize the economic realities, killing otherwise viable businesses with demands for ever-rising wages in the face of a declining contribution from labor.  As margins from manufacturing continue to decline and automation increases unions are going to have a rough go, despite the current bump in positive union sentiment.

My guess is that problems with manufacturing in China will get resolved and life will go on.

Don't know where NET will wind up.  But I like to think of downturns like the current dip in tech growth stocks as a sorting machine.  Ppl sell off the ETFs and funds, which pushes down the entire industry, but when the dust settles the strong players rise again, leaving the fakers (LMND, UBER) behind.  NET has very strong revenue growth and keeps beating estimates even though the estimates keep rising.  I rode SHOP through some ugly dips and just kept my eye on their revenue growth and it paid off big time.

But I do have some cash that needs a blue chip.  So I probably will buy some BA"
2021-05-15 19:53:09,wallstreetbets,"Mostly I agree except that COL is putting strong upward pressure on wages.  So for example I believe they have an engineering office in Oklahoma City where the median home price is about 1/5 of what it is in the Seattle area, and that's going to translate into lower wages in OK city, and they also have engineering offices in other parts of the world where salaries could be much lower."
2021-05-15 13:22:23,wallstreetbets,"I bought shop at ipo and sold it for like 150 dollars so you’re probably right about NET. I also sold plug power for 3 dollars.

The amount of money I’ve lost trying to short Tesla is probably enough to buy an actual like Tesla. 

I also sat on my balls at work last week."

“Ducking” fucking iOS hahaha"
2021-05-15 02:57:10,wallstreetbets,"Ok putting aside the wrong terminology, this is not correct. The SNB is concerned with the valuation of the Franc given international demand for it as a safe haven currency (people stockpile it in bad times). This pushes Swiss exporters into selling at higher prices, making them less competitive. What the SNB, and any central bank, would do is sell SNB and buy up foreign currencies to stem the appreciation so it doesn't get out of hand. 

They can buy up whatever they want because of the low rates. Higher rates are more attractive to investors, hence why Turkey has been raising their interest rates to attract foreign currencies and stem the selloff of the Lira. This case with the SNB is the exact opposite. What this tells you the massive demand for the Franc, such that they can print massive amounts, buy up foreign stuff at will and still maintain negative rates to spur domestic lending.

Although it sounds nice for the Swiss and the Mises institute (which is a bit of a crank think tank, they're ideologues who hate central banks to the point of misrepresenting economic realities) thinks this should spell troubles for the SNB, the extremely low rates and inflation imply they have basically no inflation and can't get growth positive. They have been in this state for years and doesn't seem to be able to get out of it. Banks need positive rates to sustain healthy lending activities. At these slightly negative rates by the CB, we understand that lending constraints (opportunities, credit risk, general market sentiment, money demand etc.) are binding and until growth kicks up, they're gonna remain in this state of limbo.

I should add the Danes were in a similar situation with the Swiss a couple of years ago, they chose to sustain a constant devaluation of the krone and got out of the large-balance-sheet state. The SNB chose to let the franc float to very high valuations and their balance sheet ballooned trying to contain it, and they're still trying now. Should've done what the Danes with once and for all."

2021-05-14 22:34:25,wallstreetbets,"Bonds I was talking bond yield rate

Basically bond yeild rate is the cost the government is going to give for giving out loans, having a negative yeild means that the Swiss government is giving out loans where they are making less on their money for what they are giving them out on

So typically let's say a loan for 1000 over a fixed term and percentage will cost after everything 1100 under normal bond yeild rates but in negative yeild rates the cost of a 1000 over the same term will be 900

Why would they do that? Well by making their currency cheaper to lend it causes the money to be more liquid, it causes more spending, growth is recorded and everyone gets rich

But what about the purposely devaluation of their dollar?

Well the Swiss government is in turn investing in the US dollar by buying American currency and hedging their dollar that way - the negative yeild rates can be offset by the generation of wealth from how the greenback performs, and the greenback will make up the difference (they use American money profits to pay the loss of loaning out Swiss francs)"

As you guys have seen, we concluded share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward shareholders. We announced the authorization of $300 million share buyback over the next 24 months.


And quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that. But at the same time, we're conscientious of the float.

2021-05-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$RBLX - DD # Introduction

I'm proud to say I've played my fair share of Roblox games. Back in the day, there were some goodies. It's actually insane how far people have pushed the limits of the Roblox engine, there's a surprising amount of at least *playable* games, which isn't what you'd expect from a kids platform. FPS's, RPGs, a fucking Pokemon game. A FUCKING POKEMON GAME. That game was a banger and I miss it, it got struck down by the iron hammer of Nintendo. Rest in peace Pokemon Brick Bronze, it had its own region to explore and everything in 3D.

Anyway, the point of giving this background is that I have personal experience with the platform, and if nothing else, it can produce relatively solid games, although I do think the quality has sunken a bit due to the sheer amount of users that have been accumulated these days (I wonder). If you're want to hold a stake in Roblox, I'd recommend checking out some of the games and seeing for yourself whether or not you think it has good prospects.

Now onto the good stuff. We'll be looking at its valuation, financial statistics, the important bits of Roblox's prospectus  (I will be referring to the updated [prospectus](http://archive.fast-edgar.com/20210513/A82VN62DZZ2RQZZZ2RJN2ZYPWOAKZZ22Z232/) for some financial statistics as well), the general moves Roblox as a company are making and how its consumer base (actual glue addict children) are responding to it.

Not financial advice, I was born without a cerebrum, and I'm addicted to glue sticks.

# Valuation

Finding a valuation for a stock that has only recently become a publicly traded company, a company operating in relatively uncharted territory for publicly traded companies no less, finding a fair valuation will have a whole lot of margin for error. Which is why you should take this section with a grain of salt. I'll be using its book value to determine a ballpark for valuation.

The stock (as of 5/14/21) has a market price per share is $70.75.

Roblox has 515,310,000 shares outstanding.

According to their 10k, In March, Roblox had $2,816,079,000 in assets, and they had $2,224,485,000 in liabilities. The difference is $591,594,000, which can be referred to as shareholder equity. If we take this number and divide it by shares outstanding, we get approximately $1.15 per share.

Now we take their market price, and divide it by their BVPS, which gives us 61.8 which is our price / book ratio. Yeah, that fucker is a little high.

Other established gaming companies and their P/B ratios:

EA: 5.04

TakeTwo: 6.0

Activision Blizzard (Fuck these guys. I'd short the shit out of them if I were a hedge fund): 4.70

So this means it's at a shitty valuation and going in will fuck you, right? Well, I'd also like to note the P/B back in Roblox's last reported quarter.

$1,847,800,000 -  $1,735,354,000 = $112,446,000

112,446,000 / 515,310,000 = $0.22 BVPS

We'll use their IPO price (\~$70) to determine last quarter's P/B

$70 / $0.22 = Around 318. Jesus fucking christ.

We can't even calculate P/E cause the company's still not profitable. By this metric, Roblox is overvalued as fuck. It's 2021 though, JPOW will turn your puts into dust no matter how hard you try.

However, this is only one way to look at it, and just because this metric doesn't add up doesn't mean there's not potential for great growth.

# Growth Potential

First off, let's take a look at its earnings + revenue.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j4vzvplrp5z61.png?width=338&format=png&auto=webp&s=b15a82d5f4765e6518840dbf999fa021d8ac8465

Very good revenue growth, especially with the pandemic forcing glue eating children to play Super Hero Tycoon. However, the earnings growth is completely negative. Let's take a look at why that could be the case.

Let's take a look at their operating expenses.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wyxje5ssp5z61.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=58a28fec8cc1fc77d8a661dc323133a05454281b

Their operating expenses far outstrip their gross profit, and in their expenses only doubled from 2019 - 2020. Here are the reasons I think this may be the case, from both using the prospectus and personal experience with the platform.

&#x200B;

* Developer Exchange Program: A program in which developers exchange Robux earned from their games to turn into tendies. Essentially, Roblox relies on these creators to create fun games for the platform, and in return they get tendies. Simple. Looking at the prospectus, from March 2020 - 2021 (will be using these date points a lot), developer exchange expenses shot up 267% from approximately $44M to $118M. If any of you degens have a useless coding degree, put that to use to develop Roblox games.
   * In my opinion, this is an incredibly bullish sign. Creators have figured out sustainable (or at the very least there's enough of them) business models for their games that incentives children to turn their tendies into virtual tendies to pay for gamepasses (basically a purchase to buy something in game. Thanks, EA). This means that developers are exchanging their hard earned virtual tendies for IRL tendies, and a whole lot of it. They will be incentivized to continue to develop on the platform in a positive feedback loop.
* Infrastructure and Trust and Safety: I'd imagine these are the expenses they incur from paying for their servers and their moderation. Basically, this is making sure 14 year old teenagers don't run around making Nazi paraphernalia. Fun fact, one of my friends got one of my accounts banned for doing that. Fucking hell. These expenses grew around 55% in the same time period (March 2020 - 2021).
   * Good things here too, this is making sure their platform doesn't turn into the wild west where people are role playing Nazis and building strip clubs. God, I wish it did, though it'd be terrible for your FDs.
* We'll tackle the R&D, General and Administrative, and Sales and Marketing expenses in the same section. All of these you can probably make a general assumption about what they do for Roblox as a company, so I'll list the statistics below.
   * R&D: 95.6% growth from March 2020 - 21
   * G&A: 208.3%
   * Sales and Marketing: 27%
      * Not much special here, it just signals that they still have a lot of room to grow as a company

I'd also like to refer you to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msq9jg/understanding_roblox_gamings_role_in_education/) qualitative analysis which explains why Roblox has such a unique business model that gives the platform a ton of potential for future growth. If you don't want to read this, here are some points that I think are important to this analysis in particular:

&#x200B;

* Roblox as a platform has the potential to encourage heutagogy, wherein students learn to be autonomous and learn different life skills through gaming as a medium.
   * I can definitely say Roblox improved my typing speed, yelling at kids requires decent typing.
* Roblox can encourage younger people with an affinity for coding / programming to learn by developing Roblox games. This can be a far more engaging way for a young degenerate to learn how to code instead of reading those weird paper wafers.
* STEM in general has been a weak area for American students, and Roblox can encourage habits that directly correlate with the field for young people.
   * ex. STEM fields: Architecture and Cloud Computing
* Developer Exchange Program is an incredibly innovative model with huge amounts of potential upside for Roblox as a company
   * Hell, I've heard rumors of like $60k a month from profitable Roblox games. Don't quote me on that.

Overall, Roblox's business model has huge potential upside if they can achieve these targets:

1. Sustainability: They need to nurture and keep a strong developerbase to continue to create and update games.
2. Reach: This large influx of users needs to stay interested in the platform to keep playing games and thereby increasing robux sales. (I'm still kind of mad about them removing tix...)

These two points are, in my opinion, the cornerstone of whether or not Roblox's model works. If their developers leave because Roblox failed to cater to them, they're not gonna have a platform; it goes up in flames. These developers also need players to play their game and incentivize them to keep developing for the platform.

# Assorted Financial Statistics

We've already went over their income statements, so let's move on to their balance sheet.

# Asset Growth

According to Yahoo Finance and their prospectus, their net assets grew by over 52.4%. From $1,847,800,000 to $2,816,079,000.

However, I will note their tangible book value and total capitalization are negative.

# Cash Flow

Yahoo finance states that their operating cash flow from 2019 - 2020 raised from $99,185,000 to  $524,340,000. This is an increase by **%428.6**. Now, the quarantine has DEFINITELY skewed this figure by a lot, but this creates a really good springboard into later years since this influx of players might stick around. Even with a conservative estimate of 40% of users joining the platform being sustained past the pandemic, that is still a substantial number of kids using their parents' tendies for virtual shit.

Their free cash flow also grew from $14,456,000 to $411,220,000. An increase of **2744.6%.**

They can, and already have been, use this cash to either reinvest into the growth of the company or keep in the bank should productivity on the platform reach a lull, whether due to school or just a lower amount of players entering the platform during a quarter.

&#x200B;

# Closing Bits and Personal Experiences

I went over my personal experiences with the game, but I might as well talk about some noteworthy games. Some of these are not what you'd consider hugely profitable but they were definitely much more on the entertaining end.

**Phantom Forces:** Battlefield inspired FPS with surprisingly tight gunplay and movement. Plus, fat, blocky hitboxes and kids with their dad's laptop makes you feel like a god.

**Blood and Iron:** Pretty niche but it's also pretty fun. Basically team deathmatch but its in the 18th - 19th century and everyone has muskets and speaks French. Also, you can play marching tunes with flutes.

**Pokemon Brick Bronze:** Actual Pokemon game with a development team that got shafted by Nintendo. It was so good that it got fucking targeted by our good friends in Japan. GodDAMN I miss this game. Unique gyms with unique layouts, 3D (albeit a little scuffed) pokemon models using the models in the actual games, and great and stylistic locations. I think there's remakes floating around but they will never beat the original. It was also paid access, and there were fucking tens of thousands playing it, so it's a very good example of just how talented these developers can be.

This game gets a mention exclusively because I'm salty. Fuck you, Nintendick.

**Arsenal:** Fun FPS mini-game type where you play Gun Game with various guns. They can get fucking wacky. It's developed by the folks at ROLVe (yes they're named after Valve) and it's built similarly to a source game. Pretty fun for short bursts of time.

**RoBeats:** Literally a Roblox rhythm type game (4 bars, notes flying down the track, no strumming) where you play songs and use the currency earned to buy new songs and stuff. Other than the fact most, if not all, of the songs are weird remixes it's still good fun. You can play with friends too so you can shit talk them for being bad.

**Assorted Anime Games:** Yeah, anime is a popular thing for 12-16 year olds, I can't exactly put my finger on it. Some of these also have a surprising amount of quality, so although most of them aren't for me today I do have some history with anime games.

If I had to give a price target, a conservative estimate would be around $85 in the summer months. Because of summer break, I'd say they'll at least beat earnings, if not downright fuck it because all the children will have more time to buy robux.

Currently no positions but to be on the safe side I'd buy shares. Growth is still not guaranteed, as above all else, they need to succeed in sustaining a playerbase and a developerbase. If they succeed in these two points, you'll make money.

If you really want to live dangerously, buy calls dated for after Q2 Earnings. Their results will be hugely skewed, once again, due to summer break for the glue eating kids. Or that's at least what I think will happen. It may not be as heavily skewed as the beginning of the pandemic, but I think they will still have very strong numbers.

Please voice your opinions in the comments and if you have corrections for any of the numbers here, I'll try to make sure I update it, but it's not guaranteed I will because I'm lazy.

2021-05-14 20:06:20,wallstreetbets,The only thing missing from this DD was your personal opinion of Nintendo and wether you have a position with them.
2021-05-14 20:14:17,wallstreetbets,I came here for the graphs
2021-05-14 21:14:49,wallstreetbets,TLDR.  How many rocket/dick emojis is it?
2021-05-15 05:57:02,wallstreetbets,Can someone please program a speaker that plays “ouuff” every time the stock price drops?
2021-05-15 17:09:30,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the link/reference to my Roblox DD, that was very kind of you. I'm glad you learned some things about education in the gaming sector from it ❤️

I'm personally a huge, huge, HUGE fan of their engagement based payout system and I think that will change a lot of things in the gaming sector."
2021-05-14 21:15:17,wallstreetbets,Highly overvalued.  No path to positive earnings.
2021-05-14 22:18:13,wallstreetbets,"That was a lot of words and no rockets, so I'm out."
2021-05-14 20:24:25,wallstreetbets,So is it a buy
2021-05-14 23:17:39,wallstreetbets,"Did your DD say something useful?

Here’s my DD. Do you think your kids will play roblox? Or something roblox innovated?

If so then fine"
2021-05-14 23:23:09,wallstreetbets,"This post needs a TLDR with positions, and some gd rocket emojis"
2021-05-15 04:41:19,wallstreetbets,Imma need a TL;DR
2021-05-15 07:52:35,wallstreetbets,"I for one think that $RBLX could prove to have some good long term value. They did do an IPO over a month ago that opened at $64. I bought some $RBLX and it's now valued at $70.95. Its been quite volatile over the last few weeks but nevertheless, I think its a long hold."
2021-05-15 10:24:41,wallstreetbets,"One simple thing, how the hell can they not make a profit during a pandemic when customers are at the highest engagement level ever, like RBLX is the only thing that kids do. That's the only turn off for me."
2021-05-15 12:33:05,wallstreetbets,"For me at least, you discredited everything you were about to say the moment you admitted to playing that shit. I’m not a hater, my kids love it. But the game is obviously for kids, parents playing with their kids, and pedos...and you don’t sound like #2 😳

Maybe I’m wrong, but it’s not going anywhere. Best way to make money off RBLX is to watch the chart and short it around 75-80 and buy calls in the mid 60s. Simple as that. Buying shares is pointless imo, but to each his own."
2021-05-14 22:57:11,wallstreetbets,"Interesting. I wonder how insiders feel about Roblox, gauging their sentiment would give an interesting perspective."
2021-05-14 20:12:35,wallstreetbets,"Fuck those guys. They killed my man Brick Bronze.   


Unironically, I have no positions and I think they're overall fine. It's just their policy on user created content that irks me."
2021-05-14 20:17:05,wallstreetbets,"Maybe if you try drawing a triangle on one of them, your calls expiring next week will make some money."
2021-05-14 20:27:06,wallstreetbets,"If I were you, I'd sit and wait for Q2 earnings, or buy enough shares to sell covered calls against them. If you already hold shares, continue to hold. 

A more risky play would be buying calls that expire a week or two past their Q2 earnings call, since summer activity will skew earnings in favor of Roblox.

That's how I'd play it."
2021-05-14 23:26:25,wallstreetbets,"Already disclosed I have no positions, but I will be watching the stock intently.

Whether or not rockets are needed, however, will be determined by JPOW and his printer in the coming weeks."
2021-05-15 08:26:46,wallstreetbets,"Roblox will need to continue to sustain their growth in their developerbase and playerbase to become profitable as a company. If they can achieve those two things, future growth is guaranteed.

As of now, the stock is overvalued.

Weak buy. If you're bullish, buy shares. Stay away from options plays; the only options I could see profiting are calls after Q2 earnings."
2021-05-14 20:52:29,wallstreetbets,"I loved the DD, thanks for the info and the laughs.  Now I want to try that game."

I don't imagine it would happen anytime soon.

I also wonder about Steam getting aquired by someone, Steam buying someone like Roblox or Roblox expanding to basically be Steam."

But you can see me in August 9, August 10, whenever the next call is, and you actually are going to hold me accountable. Q2 2020 to Q2 2021, who grew the most in the mortgage industry, UWM versus anybody? I'll take UWM. Q1 2021, the quarter we just finished, to Q2 2021, is everyone else growing? Or is everyone else going down? They're guiding down.

They're going to do less business. UWM will do more business in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter. Other people cannot do that because their business is cyclical, a lot more cyclical than UWM's. And so UWM will win, just like we told that back at the road show."

2021-05-15 03:00:46,wallstreetbets,"You know what I found interesting but am too lazy to look up and confirm?

Other mortgage companies showed slightly more growth because of their slow closing times. UWMC’s quick closing time allowed for the rising rates to be reflected in the Q1 report while the other companies using worse tech were still closing mortgages from December and January. According to Mat the other companies will show these numbers in Q2 while UWMC is guiding higher. Of course the market doesn’t care, especially with such a newly public company and all the SPAC fear. UWMC just needs time should be in good shape by EoY. You really shouldn’t put too much faith in what a CEO says about his own company on a ER call anyway but this is easily measurable I’m just to lazy to do it. 


Also, let’s not forget that Mat is bringing that old Wall Street cocaine energy. These young punks don’t even realize they’ve been snorting baking soda for the last 15 years."

This isn’t a worthless company like AMC or GME, this is a company that is rock solid, prints money, and is undervalued, as opposed to a company that is worthless, will be burning all of its money trying to make up a profitable business model on the fly and/or is in crippling debt and is severely overvalued as anything other than a short squeeze ticket."
2021-05-14 23:04:02,wallstreetbets,If it goes down to $1 per share I’m bullish due to lifelong 40% dividend yields. I would pour my life savings in at that price point because we all know this company is not going bankrupt. I’m also bullish due to the huge upside potential.

[https://public.ortex.com/live-short-interest/](https://public.ortex.com/live-short-interest/)

It appears to me that it is the actual average interest rate on any given day for the borrowed shares. It says CTB, Cost To Borrow. Not *change* in CTB. 

The following is the same tab they demonstrate on the website but for UWMC.

[https://i.imgur.com/QpDWNEU.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/QpDWNEU.jpg) 

This suggests to me that on Friday, borrowers were paying 300% average interest. Ortex posts updates for GME, AMC, and RKT on their Twitter and they represent it the same way. They've never called it *change* in CTB."

She makes 100k (820 credit rating), and i make 250k (800 cr) but because I own a business, i am self employed (and therefore too risky to approve.)

2021-05-15 10:06:05,wallstreetbets,"I work in the mortgage business and no, the average credit score to get a mortgage is not in the 800's for a residential home.  It's more like in the mid to upper 600's.  

They probably took you off the mortgage because once the computations were done on your income (using your tax returns) you probably wrote off too much and that negated your sales.

Do you file on your personal returns or do you have a sub section s (commonly referred to as an s-corp)?

If you file on your personal returns, then look at line 29 of your schedule C.  That will tell you what your actual profit was after all deductions were taken.  

If you wrote a lot off but have debt associated with your name that is not also in your wife's name, then they more than likely removed you in order to structure the loan due to a debt to income (DTI) issue.

Alternatively, how long have you been self employed?  If you have been self employed for less than 2 years, then they took you off because guidelines require someone to be self employed for at least 2 years in order to count the income"
2021-05-15 07:54:28,wallstreetbets,"I think your experience may not be typical. I've heard of plenty of people with pretty crappy credit qualifying for home loans in the US still from mortgage brokers. You might not have qualified to lower your already low rate & remove a borrower, but you would have no problem getting approved for a home loan even being self-employed."

There are also other things that don’t add up. You in your case said you needed an 800 credit rating. But 2020 saw a 42% increase over 2019 in cash-out refinances totaling nearly 159B* dollars the Wall Street Journal reported. 

That’s 159B* dollars people have taken out of equity in their homes, during a global pandemic which led to the highest unemployment since the last financial crisis, in the hottest (or most demanding, at least) housing market since the financial crisis. So when the market slows, or even declines in some areas, due to inflation or increasing rates, people who’s new LTV was 95% will be underwater when their house declines even 5%. 

I’m getting mailers telling me the average house is selling $66k above ask. Then why aren’t the houses listing for $66k above market?

The key thing to note here is the borrow rate -- the higher the interest, the less supply there is. The borrow rate is currently 93.6%, pretty steep. While this doesn't necessarily indicate a short squeeze, it does put pressure on shorts..

The reason I like this is because it seems like shorts started taking positions around $7.90 or so on 5/4. When it dipped to an all time low of $6.25 yesterday, they didn't cover. In fact ,more shorts piled in. Now the stock is at $7.60ish and market sentiment seems bullish. The pressure is on now, let's see what happens."

If you change up what you're doing and earn self employed income through different sources it resets and you gotta show history of 2 years again. Not like W2 income as long as you're in the same industry they will give you the credit of consistent employment. You can also go lower credit scores, i think as low as 580. That would be an FHA loan and those require more closing costs, higher interest, higher PMI and are very strict in terms of funding. Good luck getting anything decent with an FHA loan in this market.

The WSJ can cite that it’s going into renovations or cushion into savings, but when it’s spent it’s spent. The housing market is going to slow, and when it does, if property valuations fall, there will be problems. There are already problems in the commercial mortgage market. 

I agree, increased volume and pricing likely won’t start a crash. It’s when the volume declines (which will happen, hopefully not too sharply) or the valuation declines (worst case scenario, of course) that will begin the fall. 

Im in UWMC for 500 shares and some calls. I like the company and I think the price has been suppressed for months now. The company looks good, but no upwards movement even on good news.

**SHORT SQUEEZE**

Yeah, yeah, you’ve heard it before. Squeeze this, squoze that, or whatever the fuck. But “noT eVery sTock Is a ShOrt squEeZE”. You’re right, and nothing will compare to gaymestop, but that doesn’t mean a high SI won’t pump a stock if it starts climbing. And let me tell you shorts are jacked to their tits right now. I’m not good at words so here’s some things someone smarter than me said along with the most recent [Ortex](https://u.teknik.io/32ueS.png) data.

"" Total float is \~105mm, institutional ownership is \~6% of total shares (238mm) so about 15mm shares. This theoretically lowers the float to 90mm shares because most institutions will hold long term. So realistically we are looking at >30% of float is shorted. Also keep in mind that the numbers are estimates and this could very well be higher as utilization has also been 100% for a couple weeks now. "" - [/u/Strobe\_light10](https://www.reddit.com/u/Strobe_light10/)

Number this, number that, I'm to fucking stoopid to be able to tell you what all this number shit means. But this [website](https://fintel.io/shortSqueeze) has Canoo ranked #2 of companies ""that have the highest likelihood of experiencing a short squeeze"". Okay, that's pure speculation that GOEV claims the 2nd spot because I haven't paid to unlock the rest of the tickers, but GOEV was #1 15 days ago and I assume it's only dropped once by comparing market caps.

Days to cover is also \~10 days, meaning volume is so low it will take shorts around 10 days with average volume to close their position.

Margin requirements are high but shorts are still doubling down. This WAS a solid move, look at GOEVs chart, but shorts are smart and they’ll quickly abandon their positions once they realize Canoo is a legitimate EV company.

**GAMMA SQUEEZE**

I’m sure a lot of you idiots are familiar with this concept, but for those who aren’t, I’ll explain what’s going on here in a way that you apes can understand without boring you.

Someone has to write and sell you the FDs that you bought, typically market makers. Market makers will [delta-hedge](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltahedging.asp) with shares to gain a [delta-neutral](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltaneutral.asp) position. An option that is OTM won’t be hedged as much as an option that’s ITM. But as the option gets closer to being ITM, market makers need to buy shares to continue being delta-neutral. See where this is going?

As a stock increases, market makers need to buy more shares to hedge the call options they sold, causing the price to rise more, causing higher strike call options to become ITM, causing market makers to buy more shares to hedge the call options they sold, causing the price to rise more, so on and so forth.

This is especially volatile for low volume stocks, especially where the number of shares needed to hedge exceeds/is a significant amount of the daily traded volume.

$GOEVs average daily volume traded is 5.3m (although anecdotally I’d say the average for the past month or two has been roughly 2-3m, with days as low as \~1.5m, like today). Looking at $GOEVs low volume along with the [open interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openinterest.asp) (OI) for the 5/21 OTM call options is where things get insane. For those too lazy to read and don’t know, open interest is the number of options currently open.

Numbers were pulled today at 3:00 HOUSTON TIME

​

If you don’t know that each option represents 100 shares then you’re a literal moron and belong in this shitty sub. So those 16k 5/21 10c contracts are equivalent to 1.6m shares. When GOEV hits $10, market maker bitches will have to buy 1.6m shares to cover the call options. This is also assuming that market makers haven’t hedged the 10c, which why would they? The stock is shorted to shit and no one expects it to hit $10. And that’s only the 5/21 10c, look at the other strikes. My bet is if this shit hits $10 next week, the damn thing is soaring into the 20s, maybe the 30s.

**EARNINGS REPORT**

The one and only catalyst for this play; the earnings report happening on 5/17. Last earnings call went to shit and stock price tanked after Tony Tequila opened his big stupid fucking idiot dumb mouth. What this means though is that they’ll want to send some good news our way and save this shitty boat from sinking.

In all seriousness, I’m a fat Canoo bull long-term after listening to last earnings call, but investors panicked and shorts hopped on the red train. Tony mentioned releasing good news “soon” (manufacturing details among other things) and this could happen during this call.

**CONCLUSION**

This powder keg is ready to explode and all Canoo has to do is give us some good news on 5/17 to ignite the barrel. Quit FOMOing into shit after it’s already popped, and jump on the boat before it leaves the harbor. This is a short-term play with a long-term hodl potential, so calls if you're a ultra giga chad, shares if you're just a chad.

**Pros:**

\- Short interest is through the fucking roof

\- Open interest is higher than shit and has created a nice gamma ramp that we can walk to the moon on

\- Canoo is feeling a lot of pressure from investors to release some good news

\- GOEV is near its ATL, literally can't go any further down

**Cons:**

\- This earnings call could be negatively received like the last one

\- It'll be hard to decide whether to buy a lambo or yacht first

If you want actual long term hodl DD on Canoo, the crazy motherfuckers on the Canoo subreddit (who are wanting to stalk Tony Aquila's private jet) would be more than happy to tell you why GOEV is a solid investment. For now, all I care about is that this puppy is hitting $30 next week.

**Positions:** My entire portfolio is May/June 10c.

I believe there is a high probability contract manufacturing will be announced at the call on Monday. I believe this because the company does not have any earnings to report, so it only makes sense they move the call up this early in Q2 to give good news. The CEO Tony Tequila is an ego maniac and surely wants a ""do over"" after the horrible call in Q1, thus why they choose to give news during the call. Also look for partnership news with ride sharing and/or medium-heavy OEMs. 

However, contract manufacturing will be on the small end and short term just to get their products to market. The company has $700M cash and their plan is build a factory to produce high volume units themselves. News about this may also be dropped on the call.

With respect to either contract manufacturing OR in-house factory plans, my crystal ball is vaguely whispering ""Kentucky"" in my ear, but I'm not sure what it means. Screenshot this, make a note, whatever. After the call come back to this comment and beg me to tell you how I knew.

On the short squeeze stuff, do I expect this to rocket up to $50 a share? No. But it's worth mentioning that the borrow fee is pretty high around 25-29% and has been for months. The past month has been one of the flattest months of trading in the stock's history, so I do suspect shorts will start getting bored and begin to unwind. There is no reason to believe this will cause a squeeze, but it will help get the stock back to a fair market price. 

Volume has been DEAD on this stock lately, and seeing that Vanguard picked up 9.5M shares last month literally blows my mind because that's an entire weeks worth of volume. 

There is so much more about this company that is missed because it's so fun and easy to shit all over EV SPACs right now. Short term catalysts aside, building a position here in the $7s is a great opportunity to get in on a long term growth company with great tech. 

So the TL;DR here is I'm expecting good news on Monday, shorts should start to fuck off and the price will recover to a more reasonable range and even if it doesn't, this long term play is worth a look.

2200 commons ~10.20s average

2021-05-15 16:45:57,wallstreetbets,There are lot of catalysts in the near future. I think buying August/September calls make good sense. Earnings are always tricky.
2021-05-14 20:49:37,wallstreetbets,Right there with you.
2021-05-14 23:03:40,wallstreetbets,most of us were buying heavy thinking $12 was going to be rock bottom - this stock was attacked ... I guess I should have seen it coming - if anything I thought people would look at what happened to nio and not let that shit play out again

2021-05-14 22:24:51,wallstreetbets,"On the news page in Ameritrade there is a lawsuit, and in the lawsuit there is this paragraph...

**The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, the defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Canoo had decreased its focus on its plan to sell vehicles to consumers through a subscription model; (2) Canoo would deemphasize its engineering services business; (3) contrary to prior statements, Canoo did not have partnerships with original equipment manufacturers and no longer engaged in the previously announced partnership with Hyundai; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, the defendants' positive statements about Canoo's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.**"

2021-05-14 23:17:34,wallstreetbets,Total fucking attack.  If we get that catalyst.  Shorts are fucked.  They need to buy and we aren’t going to sell them shit.  Good luck muthafuckas.
2021-05-15 05:49:11,wallstreetbets,Attacked by a horrible business model that got worse and investors saw that it did not justify the high market cap when priced at $15-20+
2021-05-15 11:37:09,wallstreetbets,"I agree with the 2022. This was about earnings being a catalyst for a squeeze. Their negative earnings are no way going to rocket this. Shorts are under 12% of outstanding shares. Most shorts sold around $9. When it drops further from earnings, then I’m in…@$5-6. The will start buying back at that point…just my opinion."
2021-05-15 17:01:33,wallstreetbets,"It didn't get canned, it's just not gonna be their entire strategy 

Idk why people are taking ""we're gonna sell cars to people like they asked us to"" as a negative"
2021-05-14 20:18:31,wallstreetbets,This is patently false. They have a product and it’s being tested. Purely a speculative play at this point but this company is not vaporware
2021-05-14 21:51:25,wallstreetbets,"> I think it doesn’t really exist and the company is vapor ware.

Canoo has over 20 test mules running around out there with over half a million tested miles, this is vastly higher than most of the EV startup group (only excepting Rivian, which can barely be called a startup with that backing). Are you confusing them with Nikola or something? 

They have been posting the testing videos too, including deep freezing, water wading, high speed speed bumps, not just driving down a flat road like some (or downhill on the power of gravity like Trevor Milton). A comparable like Fisker only has a single prototype made driving around for photo shoots, and I say that invested in Fisker.

2021-05-15 14:01:18,wallstreetbets,What does that have to do with not manufacturing cars? This is a completely separate topic that we can get to next after you answer the first question
2021-05-14 23:06:59,wallstreetbets,They aren’t. It’s one of the few things on the platform they don’t make themselves and it’s a smart way to go about it.
2021-05-15 11:40:56,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, everyone's trying to make things sound like GME, it's not going to happen again this decade. The shorts are just enough to make for a small pop on good news, but I still don't care, I'm just holding long. They go broke and I lose a bit of money, or if they hit almost any measure of success they'll have looked very undervalued here and I make a lot more."
2021-05-15 19:27:32,wallstreetbets,I hope you're right. 20 dollar bag holder here. I went in based on that subscription model.
2021-05-14 21:06:00,wallstreetbets,Yeah I confused them with Lordstown 😔
2021-05-14 21:51:53,wallstreetbets,Hi yes so I was confusing the company with Lordstown as I have replied to two other people
2021-05-15 16:02:55,wallstreetbets,"LOL, you guys sure are but hurt about this.

1.  Canoo has abandoned their engineering business.  That means they have no income.
2. They have no relationships with OEM's to buy critical components for their cars like computer chips and batteries.
3. Their relationship with Hyundai, so they have no place to manufacture cars.

So now it is on you to explain Canoo's plans to build a car, because it certainly appears to me that they have no parts or even a place to build their car.  That is a car company that is going to go bankrupt soon no matter how much you love their youtube videos."
2021-05-15 11:43:04,wallstreetbets,I hear that!!
2021-05-15 02:19:18,wallstreetbets,"And one thing I'll mention that's important is while yes, there is a driving truck, at this point it's pretty unimportant because it's built on the exact same platform as their first car, the canoo lifestyle vehicle. 

They took an existing driving/crash test car, swapped out the cabins, and viola a working prototype. 

That will simplify their rollout of vehicles because the entire chassis and drivetrain is already in place."
2021-05-14 21:07:02,wallstreetbets,Lol - all good :) Canoo is legit. Very speculative but I believe they are trying to build this company the right way
2021-05-14 22:14:55,wallstreetbets,"Loool. Well give the links a view, Canoo is its own kind of dorky cool."
2021-05-14 23:19:28,wallstreetbets,"yeah... I think this\^ comment summarizes all the BS surrounding the GOEV stock price... a lot of people who are clueless about design and consumer trends and art and stuff are apparently getting GOEV confused with Lordstown and other start-ups that look like they have about 1/10,000 of Canoo's potential. Canoo is, to me, obviously a 'top tier' EV startup... I can just take one look at their designs and employees and see them as a Tesla competitor (meaning that people like me will be choosing the Canoo over the model X, Y, or 3; and the pickup over the cyberdouchebagmobile; and Canoo's 2024 sports car over Tesla's next release potentially)... if I'm right, I guess that should pay handsomely. I've been watching every EV design for the last ten years...and I'm kind of an artist - I have very good visual taste (judgement) and I understand fashion and trends and culture...and I'm definitely planning on buying a Canoo over a Tesla folks! That tells me something, it should probably tell you something. If you don't see a Canoo and immediately think it has mass market global potential - then you and I are not alike... I could never confuse Canoo with Lordstown... never... could never confuse them with any other EV startup I've seen - although I can say Arrival is good and their bus and van designs look nice and will be successful fyi"
2021-05-15 16:21:45,wallstreetbets,"But how do you know they won't be able to resolve their manufacturing capabilities in the future? I understand they haven't announced their plan yet, but wouldn't it be strange to think they have zero plans for the future? Same goes for any speculative business. If every company had to start right out of the gate being a full fledged business, how would they get to that point in the first place without any funding? I think you would definitely have a case if it's been 2 years later and no progress has been made. The merger happened recently and with a drastic change to their business plan, it's safe to say they need more than 1 month to develop a new plan. You might be entirely right and nothing gets accomplished on GOEV's part. Or maybe they do get those relationships with OEM's to buy critical components for their cars and they find a place to manufacture their cars. Such is the nature of speculative businesses. 

Basically, if you had evidence that they had no plans to progress forward I would be more inclined to believe you. The fact that Vanguard and black rock recently invested in them, they are hiring more people, and vehicle tests seems like decent progress to me."

Whoever is pulling the strings (and I think it’s the long whales) is crushing volatility as part of max pain strategy and thereby causing billions in options contracts to expire worthless every week. I think this shit is gonna drag out for months til everyone accepts the fair value of GME IS $150-180.  If the board is behind it I’ve gotta say “brilliant” 👏

2021-05-14 22:51:29,wallstreetbets,Buying OTM GME options doesn't work because the HFs that are shorting GME are farming the option premiums YOU PAY in order to buy more short shares and push the price down. it's a direct 1-1 translation.

2021-05-15 01:34:44,wallstreetbets,Yep indeed I did downvote the mods comment because imo I think it’s not obnoxious especially with all the new comers coming by day by day. What you gonna do? You gonna ban me? Free speech baby. Clearly if you take my comment down you are being manipulative in pushing an agenda instead of being a mod to ensure only real people are interacting with the sub
2021-05-15 03:19:47,wallstreetbets,"Awwww, someone doesn't like people's opinions on the internet guys, whatever should we do???

STFU you whiny bitch, I'm allowed to express my opinion, and that is that he should have bought shares and you're butt hurt because you've lost out on call options too."
2021-05-14 23:34:37,wallstreetbets,#Shares are for pansies in onesies

You want to say their stock is destined for blockbuster? Fine. You want to say RC is going to rule the Earth? Fine.

2021-05-15 00:13:01,wallstreetbets,"Shares are for pussies

Edit: If I bought GME shares last Jan I would have netted about 100% but since I bought calls before the pump netted 50x my initial investment, and lost about 30% of it buying more options 🤡 cause first one’s free

Edit 2: i lost more by buying AMD shares and calls 🤡🤡🤡🤡

Edit 3: bunch of salty apes out here. I still have GME shares chill out. I turned into a pussy when I lost almost half my gains to options"

2021-05-14 22:12:54,wallstreetbets,"Everyone who was here for the first squeeze knows how important gamma was for reaching the prices we did. Tards were yoloing their grandparents 401ks on the farthest OTM strikes literally the first day they'd extend the chain. At this market cap, it's very difficult to move it with little to no leverage. Buying the float helps if it ever does get a strong enough catalyst, but on its own doesn't really do much."
2021-05-15 04:09:09,wallstreetbets,It’s not squeezing because there’s no short pressure left you all collectively live in a fantasy land
2021-05-14 22:08:20,wallstreetbets,"You understand options drive gamma squeezes and a gamma squeeze will force margin calls and that's how a short squeeze is pressured. The sentiment is stop buying 800 call options that don't pressure but options are important in accelerating the end goal. The closer it gets to call strike prices, sellers of calls have to hedge and buy shares by the 100.... You're the retard, and you're the reason it's not squeezing."
2021-05-15 01:01:01,wallstreetbets,Too many retards not understanding that their retail money and middle school educations aren’t outwitting literal sharks who do this for a living is the problem.
2021-05-15 00:05:55,wallstreetbets,or its just never gonna squeeze
2021-05-14 21:45:23,wallstreetbets,Plenty of retards buying shares too tbh

2021-05-15 00:07:53,wallstreetbets,"Remember when we closed on top of every strike in the chain?  Savagely Good times 👌

Now you’re saying (and I agree) $160 is boring 😂 

it’s over. Stock went $4 to $40 (ignored due to PLTR) to $400 - she deserves a rest.  Probably get acquired by a Microsoft, around $35 a share."

2021-05-14 21:55:37,wallstreetbets,"You *do* realize that buying calls and forcing MMs to hedge creates more buying pressure than buying a few shares does, right?

This ain't a team sport, don't be naive."
2021-05-15 00:01:47,wallstreetbets,i made $$$ selling a gme call with 1 day expiry.  bought back today for $0.01.  worth the risk for weekend food money.
2021-05-14 23:24:09,wallstreetbets,GME will never reach more than 500 a share because the gov will do some fucky shit to make sure it doesnt happen. That’s the simple truth

2021-05-14 22:26:48,wallstreetbets,Why? Extra flat and extra boring weeks?
2021-05-15 09:08:36,wallstreetbets,Lol the profile is just spamming puppycorn

That hurts to read"
2021-05-14 20:29:03,wallstreetbets,"Or you could buy shares and actually help the squeeze occur sooner, instead of bending over and letting Citadel have their way with you."

All you retards have done something similar, don’t even pretend like you haven’t!!! This girl is all of us 15-20 years ago!!!"
2021-05-15 00:19:08,wallstreetbets,"Fortunately that video is so old, she’s likely an adult, possibly with kids of her own at this point."
2021-05-15 08:29:12,wallstreetbets,I have these weird shallow steps in my basement that lead outside. My 4 year old was running and fall down them hitting her forehead hard.

2021-05-15 07:55:26,wallstreetbets,I should probably tell you Reddit still counts all of it as a single upvote...
2021-05-14 23:33:31,wallstreetbets,"I see this as something of a win. Means I can buy as much rocket fuel as I want without the price going up. I can keep buying more shares until Citadel is leveraged past the point of no return. Sweet mercy, the rubber band on this slingshot just gets pulled back farther and farther every day."
2021-05-15 00:36:43,wallstreetbets,"I'm convinced that the price is being manipulated to keep things out of the money. The fact the stock closed at 159.92, literally 8 cents keeping some 3,600 contracts OTM. It also dropped at around 12:30pm, when most contracts are exercised in the last half of the day.

And this has been happening multiple weeks. If you're buying OTM calls you're literally just donating money at this point."
2021-05-14 23:04:46,wallstreetbets,That iv makes the call prices too high for a lot of people if they don't have access to buy with spreads.
2021-05-14 23:07:43,wallstreetbets,"Volume has dried up, damn Market Maker is able  to pin the strike to a favorable position. Its diffently not like it was a couple months ago when you had a shot with a OTM call printing. Right now there is no chance."
2021-05-15 00:46:16,wallstreetbets,"Yeah... because it was a *gamma squeeze*

What’s coming next... what’s always been coming, is the *short squeeze*.

We’ve bought the float over **ten times over**. Calls help shorties scrape it back.

Apples and oranges, mate."
2021-05-14 20:09:20,wallstreetbets,"Just don't get it. They'll spend 1k a week in lotto tickets instead of buying 7 shares a week. Everyone doing the latter is much more likely to trigger the squeeze.

 Hell do that for 15 weeks and you can sell a call every week to buy some lotto tickets lol"

2021-05-15 00:39:39,wallstreetbets,I'm so retarded that I've been buying video games from Gamestop.
2021-05-14 22:57:39,wallstreetbets,"not at all. Don't buy options, buy shares. Even if it's just one."
2021-05-14 23:27:42,wallstreetbets,"Kind of good advice in general. You make more money selling the tickets to win the prize, than just selling the prize itself.

If you own a lot of prizes, sell it to fools..."
2021-05-14 23:16:10,wallstreetbets,"Calls keep the gamma squeeze cycle running which helps keep it buoyant. 

Every time people think it's dead or dying monthly calls force a new gamma squeeze. 

I would bet it goes up over $200 again before the end of next week as all the people who were for sure that it would drop below $100 have to cover."
2021-05-14 22:19:55,wallstreetbets,"and that repeated call buying is precisely what keeps market makers holding shares of GME rather than selling them, leading to high institutional ownership numbers that keep their cult believing they're doing something revolutionary, as opposed to just pissing away their paychecks to day and swing traders like me who short their every climb."

2021-05-14 21:56:24,wallstreetbets,This has worked well for me this year.
2021-05-14 22:25:44,wallstreetbets,Sell a call and get absolutely obliterated when is squeezes? 🤣🤣🤣
2021-05-14 22:17:19,wallstreetbets,Wrong. Citadel is not hedging anything. They are fighting for their survival and they are doing fraud at this point. Stop buying options on GME and giving them more money.
2021-05-14 22:14:59,wallstreetbets,"You do realize that the market maker in question is Citadel and at this point, has zero reason to stick with the rules? Far more likely they collect money, and nudge it to max pain."
2021-05-15 01:19:24,wallstreetbets,I don't see why a covered call strategy can't work here. If the price spikes just keep rolling it till you hit a price you're comfortable getting exercised and collect all that juice premium along the way. Plus you can take money from morons buying FDs and put that straight back into GME
2021-05-15 01:17:54,wallstreetbets,Yeah cuz the government totally wants to destroy the world's faith in the markets AND deny themselves a massive short term capital gains windfall
2021-05-14 22:01:07,wallstreetbets,"You go granny!

Tell those boomers what's up!"
2021-05-15 11:59:03,wallstreetbets,All these downvotes 😂😂😂
2021-05-15 11:40:30,wallstreetbets,I literally don’t care
2021-05-14 22:35:08,wallstreetbets,I mean if some of my shares get called away at 250 I’m not gonna cry about 400%+ gains.  Until then I’m happy collecting a few hundred a week in premium.
2021-05-14 22:36:19,wallstreetbets,"Pro tip, need capital to buy st0nks too"
2021-05-14 22:06:20,wallstreetbets,"I'm guessing you've never heard of leverage and MM hedging?

Here's an example:

How many shares must a MM buy to stay delta neutral when they sell a call with a delta of 0.80?

Hint: It's a lot more than the number of shares that the money spent on the call would get you."
2021-05-14 20:05:28,wallstreetbets,Ive been doing both.....and that’s why im way up in spite of what palantir is trying to do to me
2021-05-14 22:49:51,wallstreetbets,"Lol more like over 10,000......im still sittin on 108 shares at a 12/share cost average 😜😎"
2021-05-15 06:37:40,wallstreetbets,"The reason why I'm done with gme in my mind is that shorts usually have a pretty quick expiration date and it's been 3 and a half month's since the price peaked. There's just no way the hedges haven't covered already, because if they haven't all that interest would be bleeding them dry. Which was the original goal, and this almost 100% would have worked if a certain brokerage didn't commit market manipulation to fuck us"
2021-05-14 23:06:21,wallstreetbets,"people here really don't give a shit. 

this is WSB, world of FD, YOLO, Gain/Loss porn, sarcasm and meme.

people are here for that shit. not GME preaching. if you don't like it, you can stay on other sub."
2021-05-15 06:21:36,wallstreetbets,"Always inverse WSB if they really think they understand shit.

This is rule no1."
2021-05-15 09:19:57,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but I'll settle for a ban bet. Give me a prediction for when the squeeze will happen, and a price target of you've got balls. If we can agree, then if the price goes above the target by the date specified I'll accept a ban, if not, you will. Deal?"
2021-05-15 09:11:33,wallstreetbets,"Who the fuck do you think is selling you shares, numbskull"

2021-05-15 16:36:05,wallstreetbets,"We aren’t, but as much fun as we have we do try and be smart, read a few numbers, and MAKE TENDIES. Noticing the high IV and knowing that it might be better to buy shares isn’t against this sub."
2021-05-14 23:33:25,wallstreetbets,I see GameStop shares as having very large quick profit but also having a fundamental value to back it up just in case it goes tits up
2021-05-15 00:36:27,wallstreetbets,Not sure why you are getting down voted. This sub is for option. A bunch of us made a shitload of money from calls before the apes came in
2021-05-15 08:02:31,wallstreetbets,"Except shares are more valuable than calls when it relates to GME... God damn its like people have never invested anything before, ever, but feel the need to chime in with their fucking dumb points. This sub feels like an extended Kindergarten that I definitely don't know anything about.."
2021-05-15 06:23:56,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, the company that is overvalued by x8 currently that has a hypothesised infinite upside is TOTALLY NOT RISKY

2021-05-15 11:49:11,wallstreetbets,"Judging from the upvote to down ratio. Umm I think I’m good thanks for asking. And no we are not talking about politics. We are being watched over by the SEC and I’m trying to catch out any mod who’s trying to manipulate apes into collusion which is highly illegal. Is that a problem to you? Because if it is and you like collusion you should end up in a cell like a small fry does as the big guys get away. Go ahead and sign your sentence. Reply with fuck the Fed or that I’m wrong with being against collusion

Go ahead I’m waiting😉"
2021-05-15 03:16:35,wallstreetbets,"Wait, what? Even before the fuckening of Jan '21 this sub was always a place of retards with no idea what they were doing yoloing their life savings into shitty FDs they don't understand.

2021-05-15 08:51:58,wallstreetbets,Paramedic here. Kids are actually really resilient to traumatic brain injuries. If someone over 70 years old hit their head like that it could easily kill them.
2021-05-15 00:40:49,wallstreetbets,Haha not always. I seen some fights that ended with that noise and they were mostly fine. Mostly.
2021-05-15 06:03:05,wallstreetbets,I hope someone places that sound over other things like they did with OOF
2021-05-15 15:08:20,wallstreetbets,I knew someone that was bringing his square blue recycle bin out to the street and he slipped on ice banged his head and died on the spot. Just a freak accident.
2021-05-14 22:38:54,wallstreetbets,I legit slipped off the back of a truck the other day when it was raining and SMASHED the back of my head on the corner metal piece that makes a 90 degree edge.

2021-05-15 12:42:00,wallstreetbets,"I've said it so often and no one has any counter argument. Just downvotes. 

HF's manipulate these huge spikes (either intraday and/or Intraweek spikes), call option premiums inflate crazy high, HF's sell OTM naked calls and collect the premium. They then suppress the price and make sure the calls they sold expire worthless and collect millions in premium. 

Essentially, if this is happening the can avoid covering their short positions as long as they want if people keep buying OTM calls. And they will. If this is what's happening this thing could literally go on for years"

Dude, that is way exaggerated and you know it. First of all, the *total* float ownership is much less than 1000% (was it \~200%? I forgot) and second of all, the retail fraction is only (depending on source) around 10%-30% of that total float ownership."

And I'm not sure how you misread that, but the line saying ""try talking about politics"" wasn't accusing you of talking about politics. It was pointing out that that there very obviously isn't have any sort of freedom of speech required here.

Also, you're an idiot. You think a mod telling people to stop telling a guy not to buy options (in an options subreddit) is collusion? And illegal? Big brain you got right there, buddy.

Although I would like to point out that telling people to buy shares instead of options because (they believe) that options don't help them jack the price of the stock up *is manipulation*. You've got it quite backwards here.

I'm sorry that you've lost money trading them, but that just tells me you need to get good, not that there's something inherently bad about trading derivatives."
2021-05-15 10:54:59,wallstreetbets,Math was definitely wrong. Shares would have made 1000% not 100%.

2021-05-15 09:17:36,wallstreetbets,">So my end can never be over $200 but your end of the bet is theoretically unlimited.

Here's my counter:

I'll take the theoretically unlimited risk but I want you to have some real risk too otherwise what's even the point of this. I'll wager the value of one share of GME at close of regular market at 4pm EDT Friday the 21st but I want you to put up $420.69.

Also you said above $200 so I want to see trades above $200.01 for full shares. A max of $200 would mean I win.

Finally, I want more than a single share traded above $200. Let's say a volume of at least 200 above $200 as determined by  [the nasdaq website](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/real-time) to try to make manipulation of this bet more difficult.

And no premarket/after hours because that shit is like a dozen people trading shit back and forth in a vacuum."

2021-05-15 14:08:52,wallstreetbets,"Anyone who owns shares, obviously, not just citadel. In this case Citadel is largely responsible for the buying and selling action going on, so to an extent I can see your point... THAT is what is irrelevant though. Enough people buy and hold shares, and there aren’t any more shares to go around, so in order to move the market price they have to create more and more “spoof” shares. Also, if you’re buying from a brokerage like Fidelity, your transaction is happening via a company which already owns millions of legit GME shares, in which case and Hedge fund synthetic-share fuckery is essentially “insured” to an extent. 

All that buying options does is put money directly into their hands with practically 0% chance of putting them in a worse off place, considering that they write and sell you most of those options. (With the extremely rare exception of “safer” options that go more easily in the money, which are usually not the kind that WSB mouth breathers are buying.)

Buying shares is objectively better, if you believe any of the DD, and that a squeeze might be possible. If you don’t believe the squeeze is possible, than of course, nothing I just said matters to you."

Their fundamentals tell a story of steady decline. It’s fading. https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/gamestop-says-ceo-george-sherman-to-resign-starts-search-for-successor-6788761.html

They cut pay to their CEO last year due to sales tanking ttps://www.thewrap.com/gamestop-ceo-george-sherman-executive-team-take-50-pay-cut-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/

And now the CEO is resigning (you don’t resign from rocket ships). Their CFO and CCO have also bailed. The big spin is “oh they’re moving to e-commerce” which is literally shorthand for “our entire business mode has failed and we are scrambling to be viable.” I.e. they aren’t viable, and there are already a ton of e-commerce companies and more startups on the way. GME is late as fuck. https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/gamestop-says-ceo-george-sherman-to-resign-starts-search-for-successor-6788761.html

I accept your 200 full share volume above $200 with $200.01 plus qualifying. 

But I'm getting ready to buy a house so I can't afford $420.69 right now so let's give you a cap of $420.69 and myself a cap of $200. 

My payout could be between $0 and $200 where your payout could be between $0 and $420.69. 

I believe this is fair since I'm taking the long odds on this one and it's more likely to be near $200 if it does go over. Keep in mind the payout is the price at close on Friday.

PC game codes sale (à la Humble Bundle, Fanatical, etc)

Brand new management team, including a chairman who built a company from the ground up that beat Amazon in the pets accessories market, other managers from that company and managers from Amazon

Board that will be paid in stocks so that they have an interest in seeing their price go as high as possible

Getting rid of a board member that is known to be a mole that works with hedge funds to ruin companies

10B valuation in a 300B market if we only count video games, that doesn't include PC parts and accessories, TCG, e-sport

If the short interest is, let's say 200% (I believe this is conservative) that means there's ~140M shares in existence. If the float is 30M shares that means roughly 5x the FLOAT needs to be bought back. If SI is higher and actual float is lower, 10x is more than possible."
2021-05-15 14:17:56,wallstreetbets,"Added to my comment. Their “no debt” is only because the company had been failing so horrifically that they ended up getting short squeezed — and then miraculously bailed out by the internet. They were swimming in debt before that.

If a poor person wins the lottery, they usually blow the money. Even if they have all these grand ideas of what they’ll do now, they just don’t know how to succeed. That’s GME.

If you're selling CCs on a stock and it suddenly rises, do you know what your loss is?

$0.

&nbsp;

If you have 200 shares @ $150 and sell a CC with a $160 strike and then the price shoots up to $10,000/share, then your CC goes ITM and gets exercised you get assigned.

You then receive 100 x $160.
Then you sell your other 100 shares at $10,000.

You now have $1,016,000, of which $986,000 is profit.

You don't have ""unlimited losses"" and you don't lose ""all the profit from your shares"" for holding ""even 1""."

2021-05-15 14:35:43,wallstreetbets,"Just to address all of these:
1) you say the fundamentals tell a story of decline, but GameStop recently paid off all of their debt, they have a significant amount of cash on hand, and their sales have been improving a lot. 
2) the CEO is being forced out. He’s not jumping ship, he’s being pushed off of it, mostly due to underperforming and not living up to the terms of his contract, which is why he forfeited a bunch of stock too. Meanwhile, they’re bringing in a team of executives that were very successful at chewy and Amazon. That seems good to me, not bad.
3) I’m not sure where you’re getting the idea that they’ve been downgraded by everyone. Fidelity uses something called an “equity summary score.” It works by taking the opinions of over a dozen different independent analysts and giving a weighted average of their opinions based on how accurate they’ve been in the past in the sector that the stock belongs in. On a 1-10 scale, GME currently sits at a 6.2, which is an increase of over 4 points from just a few months ago. 

I find it weird that you basically compiled a bunch of incorrect information to form a negative narrative. I’m all for dissenting opinions about the situation, but it almost feels like you threw some random links together and made misleading statements assuming no one would bother to read them"

2021-05-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$VIAC: A Hunch and A Volcano Waiting to Explode **Intro**

There have been many posts recently about VIAC, and for good reason. The stock is chronically undervalued.

There have already been some posts that have gone very in depth about the fundamentals of VIAC that I read after I had a position in the stock, but are nonetheless very enlightening:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n6byd0/viac\_is\_very\_undervalued\_in\_an\_overvalued\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n6byd0/viac_is_very_undervalued_in_an_overvalued_market/)

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n3k1gk/god\_tier\_dd\_viac/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n3k1gk/god_tier_dd_viac/)

In fact, some of these reports are some of the first 'good' posts I have seen on WallStreetBets since the GME craze has dragged out months too long, but I digress.

**Summary**

If you don't know VIAC has already gone SuperNova, just not in the way you might like. Essentially due to some Wall Street shenanigans with margin trading in amounts that would make even the most brazen in the WSB crowd blush, the stock shot through the roof for some time. Some institutions/ hedge funds found about this, and decided to sell realizing that if VIAC ever crashed it would crash hard, and boy did it. Losing more than half its value in just a fews days, VIAC was essentially nuked to shreds. But, the company continues to grow and recent earning reports have been good, yet the stock has not been able to push past the $40 dollar mark. This is where my theory comes in.

**Why I Made This Post and A Simple Theory**

We could hypothesize all day about why VIAC isn't budging from its current price point. Perhaps institutions aren't willing to touch VIAC yet because the downfall left a bad taste in their mouth. The lamb's blood is on the door so to speak. Perhaps the valuation right now is fair and the wisdom of the masses is outsmarting me and you (if you read the DDs this does not seem to be the case but let's play devil's advocate for a minute). It could be a bevy of other things that are too technical for us retail traders to understand (even though I believe these complexities are hardly ever the reason markets move). But, I have a simpler theory: there are some whales who are offloading their shares around the $40 range, and once we pass this mark this thing is going to go gangbusters.

[I don't draw on charts very often so sorry if this is sloppy ](https://preview.redd.it/d19cx5w5j5z61.png?width=1130&format=png&auto=webp&s=a06c565a7ac465a7e144cb54afb2b6faa7747654)

If you look at the charts VIAC just keeps bouncing around that $40 range, and that resistance is most likely caused by whales who didn't sell fast enough to cut their losses. These whales have hit this resistance multiple times, and the dam is weakening. There seems to be no viable explanation other than this as to why VIAC has not gained at least a marginal amount, it simply defies logic.

I made this post not to convince you that VIAC is undervalued or anything like that, if you can't see that you should stop trading now because this is as blatant as it gets. I made this post to tell you to get on board while you still can. The resistance is not going to last much longer.

Come make some money with me.

2021-05-15 09:46:55,wallstreetbets,I bought $50 short calls after it dipped to 40 thinking it had to be over and that a reversal was imminent. 3 thousand dollar mistake 🤡

2021-05-15 11:50:38,wallstreetbets,I have $50 calls expiring in January that are down 47% that I bought on 4/27. FML.
2021-05-15 17:43:41,wallstreetbets,if it wasnt for Jan-March's bubble there is no visible change to VIAC
2021-05-14 20:51:33,wallstreetbets,I think the float is too big to do anything substantial with VIAC. Probably be a day or two of decent bounces but nothing compared to some of the other stocks out there right now.

2021-05-14 23:12:45,wallstreetbets,"I really dig on this. 
 One of the big problems I see with the stocks that trend, and in the rules even of WSB, is no one is looking at the little guys. I'm talking the penny stocks.
 You think AMC and GME have been big paydays. There are literally hundreds upon undress of little companies traded in the pennies that are heavily shorted. Companies that have real products and are trying to do good stuff.
 They are just as heavily shorted as the bigger ""meme stocks"". If the goal is to make the hedge funds bleed, I  think taking a stock that is heavily shorted in the pennies and taking it to $10+ would cause a catastrophic bleed for the hedge fucks. And there would be far more apes with Lambos.
 Now I'm sure someone with less of a smooth brain can more efficiently sort these stocks out. Some of the pennies are so far diluted we would need loads of yoloing fucks to hop in. But you have some that sure there maybe a bit of shares, but when $100 can buy you 100k stocks, that adds up fast.
 I really think the mindset should be to move from stock to stock to cause the biggest bleed. If that's not the goal, then what is?"

2021-05-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Weekly Market Recap for Gamblers and Degenerates - May 10th to May 14th What’s poppin bull-gang, Flux here with your weekly recap of the markets! Earnings season has largely come to an end, meaning we can slowly get back to “normal” movement among stocks, giving us some easier trading conditions! We’ve also had a whole plethora of real-world news, so without further ado, let’s get into it.

&nbsp;

- **At the start of the week, it was revealed that Colonial Pipeline, the largest pipeline operator in the United States, was taken hostage by hackers**. Most energy related stocks took a hit as the hack disrupted supply chains across many regions. By the end of the week, Colonial Pipeline reported that they’ve made substantial progress in safely restarting the pipeline system, and can report that product delivery has recommenced in most of the markets that they service. Unbeknownst to most, Colonial Pipeline revealed that they ended up paying nearly $5 million dollars to the hacking group to regain control of their pipes, likely explaining how they managed to get back up and running so quickly.

&nbsp;

- **Stocks plunged throughout the first half of the week**, likely due to investors realizing that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices. These inflationary pressures  may then prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, which in turn would deliver a swift beatdown to most of our favourite tech and growth stocks. Furthermore, among these inflation fears, the CPI report was set to come out this week and confirm everyone's suspicions, so the market obviously had to price in a dogshit report before we could continue melting up.

&nbsp;

- **On Wednesday the CPI report came out**, and although the numbers weren’t the best, they were already priced in so the damage wasn’t all that bad. The CPI rose 4.2%, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis, compared to the respective estimates of 2.3% and 0.3%. While the inflationary readings are definitely not good, they were expected, and with the SPY trading near ATHs for consecutive weeks and the stretched valuation of most tech stocks, the sell-offs were to be expected.

&nbsp;

- **On Thursday, the Department of Labour released their Weekly Unemployment Report**. The initial jobless claims came out to 473,000 vs. the 490,000 expected while continuing claims clocked in at 3.655 million vs. 3.650 million expected. Fairly average numbers, all things considered. We’re showing clear signs of recovery, albeit slowly.

&nbsp;

- **By Friday, most of the chop was resolved**. VIX plummeted, and most indices made up almost all the lost ground throughout the week. It seems as if the 24hr news cycle has made everyone's attention span too short for a bear market, as all problems are forgotten within a week. Inflation numbers are suspect, job numbers are suspect, but the market just keeps grinding up. Keep the music playing, and the good times rolling.

&nbsp;

- **This week's earnings reports were pleasant, with almost *every* reporting company catching some awesome gains**! Even shithole Doordash managed to deliver some returns to investors, clocking 22% gains in a single trading session. It was a stark contrast to last week, where most reporters slid instead. I’m truly sad that earnings season is coming to an end, as it has been good to me this quarter.

&nbsp;

All in all, that wraps up this week's recap! I hope you all had an awesome week, and made a fat stack of cash. If you would like a copy of these newspapers in advance, feel free to check out the Discord! I hope you all get to enjoy the nice weather and have a wonderful weekend! I’ll catch you all at the casino come Monday. Cheers 😎"

2021-05-15 07:29:31,wallstreetbets,"Why triple digits? Many reason. 
1. China wants 50% of the vehicles on the road to be EVa by 2026
2. They are the only company doing battery swaps and most of China’s population lives in densely populated major city’s where charging stations aren’t available.
3. They are building a lifestyle brand that goes beyond an auto company.
4. Expansion into Europe.
5. They have a highly talented autonomous driving team that is just as good as Tesla’s. 
6. Their battery technology keeps getting better and better.
7. They are backed by the fucking Chinese government. They don’t lose unless the government wants them too and I believe Nio will be the Chinese household name for EVs
8. We also have to realize how young of a company Nio is and how fast they are progressing. Its astounding what they accomplished already"

2021-05-14 21:29:16,wallstreetbets,But where’s the real money going to come from?? the rev from no price ceiling no parallel imports or no counterfeits?? Plus if there’s a limit on drug costs what did Dr. Reddy‘s version be a cheaper and better alternative

2021-05-15 00:14:40,wallstreetbets,There isn't going to be any squeeze action on AMC unless the price goes up 3x or something insane like gamestop did. With the 400+ million shares that seems unlikely. The big uptick in price this week is entirely retail driven.
2021-05-14 20:21:39,wallstreetbets,"This is false. It's not that people are disinterested in going to movies. It's an American Pastime at this point. There are just some movies that'll I'll want to see on a big screen and not a small ass TV.

Now with AMC doing concerts and private showings and theater rentals for movies and even video games. There are lots of new revenue streams for them to make money.

Movie theaters aren't going away because of Corona.

This isn't Blockbuster and VCR rentals. This is an event, that people want to go out and do. My state actually has sane people and are already operating at full capacity. It's only a matter of time before the rest do to.

They WILL be profitable again, soon."
2021-05-14 20:28:53,wallstreetbets,Most of the retail dumb enough not to care about their revenue and expenses are already balls deep in AMC

How do you expect them to turn a profit in 2021 or 2022 given all their extra debt expenses now? And without blockbuster movies coming out that exceed the 2019 movies? It just isn't going to happen.

What can happen is they can downsize, close some of the under performing theaters, and keep selling more stock as needed in the future to put off the inevitable bankruptcy as long as possible."
2021-05-14 20:40:17,wallstreetbets,From a bullish stance (besides the quick flip potential on return to the movies) movie theaters struggled because no one could afford to freaking go anymore. The masses didn’t have extendable income to blow. Taking a family of 5 to the theaters could bankrupt someone. The average person now has more savings and less debt than ever before. If covid is contained you will see at least 4 quarters worth of extraordinary revenue beats imo.
2021-05-14 20:17:42,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it’s based off the hole in the rest stop stall"
2021-05-15 06:23:11,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it's last in series, and 2019 did suck, but we also had no government in 2019 ;-/ .. will be great start, at least first year after covid, not to mention the dopes and their market plays falling apart in thier portfolios."
2021-05-15 17:44:22,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah? What markets are open on Sunday?
2021-05-14 21:59:18,wallstreetbets,"Mismanagement? Downsizing issues? Misappropriation of funds? There are perfectly valid situations that could have created the situation. It doesn't mean it's terminal, or can never be recovered from.

I've already listed several reasons how they can secondarily make income. 

Chance the Rapper is doing shows in them across the country. Why wouldn't that take off? Musicians want to make an income. If stadiums aren't open why not do smaller shows for at least some income? I also think it'll be more personal of an experience rather than a stadium. I can see bands really being in to doing this. And keep doing it even when stadiums open. Especially smaller bands.

Local music scenes may spring back up again. Where kids will go to see their friends and local touring bands.

I know, I'm an optimist. 

I can see them pulling this off. People like going out to the movies, as evidenced by how many people bought tickets and how many blockbusters we had. They just need to start managing better. 

You fire some people, get some new people in there and you have a functioning business. 

You are making it more detrimental than it is."
2021-05-14 20:46:11,wallstreetbets,"Movies are inexpensive and easily accessible alternative to sports games, theme parks, and other expensive forms of entertainment.

I have no doubt attendance will grow from 1st qtr 2021 levels. But it's easy to track the domestic weekly box off, compute AMC's share of revenue, add on a multiplier for concession sales, and quickly come to the conclusion that they'd need record setting box offices every week to break even. The odd blockbuster helps but if you have a $400m week with $50m weeks before and after, you're not making enough money. The only profitable thing they're doing at this point is selling stock to retail holders who don't realize what they are buying."
2021-05-14 21:16:35,wallstreetbets,"Somehow I'm not surprised an AMC bull calls it ""extendable income"" and thinks that covid led to people having more money saved and less debt"
2021-05-14 20:21:38,wallstreetbets,Sounds glorious
2021-05-15 17:45:49,wallstreetbets,Bold of you to assume I can read.
2021-05-14 22:13:14,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure they can find some new ways to get revenue up but you don't seem to have a realistic overview of their expenses and debt. Even if revenue goes back to 2019 levels (I think their highest ever?) I don't believe they can make ends meet without additional stock sale. Getting up to 2019 levels is going to be nearly impossible until 2023 given the lack of movies in the pipeline. Contracts with the studios are being renegotiated with a quicker streaming option cropping some of their revenue potential making their future even more murky.

I think they survive in one form or another but the chances that they return any profit to equity investors is really low relative to the chances they go bankrupt in 2022 wiping out shareholders completely which is still low but significant. The lack of profit to shareholders and the persistent risk of bankruptcy will continue to weigh heavily on the stock. Sure it's being propped up now by ""diamond hand"" investors who expect it to go up in value but when that doesn't happen... It's going to be a blood bath."
2021-05-14 21:24:06,wallstreetbets,I bet you check for spelling errors in Applebees menu
2021-05-15 00:02:54,wallstreetbets,"You do realize they issued 43 million shares at $9.94 to rack in $428 million this week, they have the liquidity to not only avoid bankruptcy but it puts them in a prime spot to do several things which the CEO has announced: 

1. They can pay off debt on their leases by offering equity instead of cash

2. They can establish a foot holding in Europe and acquire competitors, they don’t have as strong of a presence there

Every time including this past week, the company has ever issued more shares, the stock price has gone up not down despite being diluted because they are strategic with how it is spent. The company has been in business for 100 years despite people saying VCR, DVD, streaming was going to replace it because people thoroughly enjoy going to the movies and the experience. More people go to the movies than all sporting events combined."
2021-05-15 00:13:17,wallstreetbets,"They lost 540 million in the first quarter of this year alone, lol. And I believe have $400 million in back due lease payments among their various $5+ billion in total debt. 

Paying off the leases in equity (stock) just further dilutes existing shareholders further reducing the risk of any return on equity. And I'm not sure if they still have any convertible debt options left to them given the latest offering.

I don't blame AMC. They are doing what they need to do to try to survive and pay their employees, especially management. But it's a looking like a losing battle. 

I don't think movies are going to end any time soon. But other players like Cinemark are in much better financial shape. AMC has worked themselves in to a bad position which COVID made awful and it seems like bankruptcy is the only real way out of it. 

All things considered anyone buying AMC stock is just setting themselves up to be a future bagholder IMHO. There is money to be made on upswings but trading on a losing stock is a zero sum game. Don't get left holding the bag."

So after I cleared it with my gf, I called her out on it. She had been grooming my dog for 5 years, always has some sideways comment about my dogs behavior or some difficulty she had with her. To me, it always seemed like an excuse to charge more than her normal rate ($90 every 3 weeks) but since I wasn't paying for it, and finding a groomer for my dogs breed isn't easy, I would let it go. Not this time. All I said was "" I don't think you did a very good job"" and you know what she tells me? ""I get a lot of compliments from other groomers, so actually, I did a really good job"". Then she started making comments about ""well the price isn't for everybody"" etc. I very politely, and unceremoniously fired her ass. I don't have any patience for sociopathic behavior.

Well just now I go to her website and my girlfriends review from 4 years ago is prominently displayed as sort of an advertisement and it really chaps my hide. The last time I took the dog to see her, she did NOT want to go in for some reason, I should have known right then and there. Now I kinda want to learn to groom dogs and put her ass out of business. Am I being petty?

Bloomberg) -- Billionaire George Soros’s investment firm snapped up shares of ViacomCBS, Discovery and Baidu as they were being sold off in massive blocks during the collapse of Bill Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management.

Soros Fund Management bought $194 million of ViacomCBS Inc., Baidu Inc. stock valued at $77 million, as well $46 million of Vipshop Holdings Ltd. and $34 million of Tencent Music Entertainment Group during the first quarter, according to a regulatory filing released Friday. A person familiar with the fund’s trading said the company didn’t hold the shares prior to Archegos’s implosion.

Soros also increased its bet on Amazon.com Inc. and homebuilder DR Horton Inc., which is now its second-largest public equity position.

The 13F, which money managers overseeing more than $100 million in U.S. equities must file quarterly, revealed that Soros held $4.5 billion of U.S. equities, down $77 million from the prior quarter.

The biggest exit in the quarter was Palantir Technologies Inc. Soros sold 18.5 million shares valued at about $435 million. The firm originally revealed it owned a stake in the controversial data-mining company controlled by Peter Thiel in November, but rapidly issued a statement saying the original investment was made in 2012 and it regretted the decision.

2021-05-15 19:40:42,wallstreetbets,"The problem with the stock market is that having more money is the greatest advantage. If you have 1 million dollars you can buy boomer funds or dividends and make 80-100K a year just on capital gains. Meanwhile, if you have less money, you need to buy riskier assets and speculative stuff like GME, AMC, just to grow your account. Buying boomer funds and dividend stocks with just $1000 dollars is meaningless. It would take you almost 9-10 years to double 1000 dollars with boomer funds. But buying riskier stuff because you need better returns increases the chances of losing money."

2021-05-15 17:37:09,wallstreetbets,"After mating with a male, the female butterfly must go in search of a plant on which to lay her eggs. Because the caterpillars that will hatch from her eggs will be very particular about what they eat, she must be very particular in choosing a plant. She can recognize the right plant species by its leaf color and shape. Just to be sure, however, she may beat on the leaf with her feet. This scratches the leaf surface, causing a characteristic plant odor to be released. Once she is sure she has found the correct plant species, she will go about the business of egg-laying. While laying her eggs, they are fertilized with the sperm that has been stored in her body since mating. Some butterflies lay a single egg, while others may lay their eggs in clusters. A sticky substance produced by the female enables the eggs to stick where ever she lays them, either on the underside of a leaf or on a stem"

Imagine Cathie’s stocks go up 50% from current price (SKLZ, OPEN, PLTR, PATH, DKNG, NNDM) 

Imagine the memes legitimately pop up (GME to $1000 PT and the documentary with the roaring kitty is for when he reaches $500 million net worth)

Imagine the decent-meme level stocks that are undervalued pop to oblivion (RKT, UWMC, AI, PENN)

Imagine the tech-stock valuation stocks keeps going up (COUR, TSM, ESI, FB, MSFT, CPNG, AAPL, GOOG)

Imagine SPACS make a huge comeback over 100% after a huge downtrend (QS, MP, DM, PSFE, RSI, GNOG, etc)

55F Cloudy with a chance of rain

It is better to endeavour for dreams that may never come to full fruition and to later harbor bittersweet memories and lessons of trying with warm sentiment, that to reminisce in regret and remorse about what should have been, what could have been, and what would have been become one of those small, lost pieces of hope and chance.

Uncertainty and ambiguity about the future is natural, uncomfortable, and menacing, yet at the same time is what makes anticipation so exhilarating, while uncertainty about the past is flat out depressing and heart rending. In the long run, advancing forwards at all costs is the only rational, logical play.

In the end, our futures are what drive us forwards, sometimes making it the right course of action to simply throw caution to the wind and let our dreams not be memes.

In essence, I ask my knight /u/memetron9000 and my men at arms u/angrysc0tsman12 and u/Enigmaticriddler to simply ignore any doubts they may have about our plans, and instead follow my charge into the future."

2021-05-15 07:44:39,wallstreetbets,"“Gex-If you haven't followed yet, there's a fairly predictable monthly cycle where it increases from about Thursday the week before OPEX to about Tuesday/Wednesday morning the week of MOPEX. This has been tradeable.

This is because of the action of gamma. Gamma of near-at-the-money options increased as expiry gets closer, with basically infinite gamma at the ATM strike when expiry occurs. This is why GEX rises, but is partially dictated by the range at which SPX travels during the month.

It's fairly unsurprising to see us pretty high up because we spent a lot of time at the current spot, and hence a lot of OI was sitting there. Additionally, a lot of put gamma likely rolled off with today's expiry.

What's interesting is I usually imagine this like an umbrella closing. The wider the range travelled by SPX, usually the wider the distribution of the OI (for obvious reasons - the near ATM strikes almost always are the most popular to trade). For a month where we barely move

there's a ton of gamma that remains up to expiry pretty close to the spot, and hence it increases and we see larger and larger values.”"

We will be united in our common interests.

Perhaps its fate that today is the 4th of July, and you will once again be fighting for our freedom, not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution -- but from annihilation.

We're fighting for our right to live, to exist.

And should we win the day, the 4th of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day when the world declared in one voice:



""We will not go quietly into the night!

We will not vanish without a fight!

We're going to live on!

We're going to survive!""

If u are charging 100 dollars for a job and u expect a 30 percent margin.   For every 70 cents spent you will have earned revenue of 1 dollar.   Not actuall revenue but earned revenue.  End of month u balance what the cost was vs what was actually billed to figure your revenue.   just remember underbilling bad over billing good.  Over billing means u have more revenue than earned revenue.  

like Insaid though its weird untill it clicks and then it makes sense.   everything is the same besides the way u accrue revenue."

The boomer customer base who've kept Harley back from succeeding when they release something new and innovative are slowly dying off, and a younger crowd not interested in bloated baggers and large touring bikes are gaining interest in the brand. They have positive earnings Year over year and despite the pandemic have been rising steadily and theyre still selling fucktons of merchandise and they cant keep bike inventory due to supply being shut down and as a result bikes prices have risen significantly. Thinking of picking up some leaps and adding shares little by little on a dip. Probably hit $60 to $70 a share by EOY. 


TLDR: Go Long on HOG"

After the market closed I thought that the last batch I was going to sell didn’t go and was thinking of raising the price for Monday morning drop. To my surprise, I couldn’t find these contracts and then I realized that they were sold. Right before Friday close VXX dipped to $38.22 for a minute and shot back to $38.60.

Step one: you must create a sense of scarcity. Shells will sell much better if the people think they're rare, you see. Bear with me, take as many shells as you can find and hide 'em on an island. Stockpile 'em high until they’re rarer than a diamond

Step two: you gotta make the people think that they want 'em. Really want 'em, really fuckin' want 'em, hit 'em like Bronson. Influencers, product placement, featured prime time entertainment. If you haven't got a shell, then you're just a fucking waste, man

Three: it's monopoly, invest inside some property. Start a corporation, make a logo, do it properly. ""Shells must sell"", that will be your new philosophy. Swallow all your morals, they're a poor man's quality

Four: expand, expand, expand. Clear forest, make land, fresh blood on hands

Five: why just shells? Why limit yourself? She sells seashells, sell oil as well

Six: guns, sell stocks, sell diamonds, sell rocks. Sell water to a fish, sell the time to a clock

Seven: press on the gas, take your foot off the brakes. Then run to be the president of the United States

Eight: big smile mate, big wave, that's great. Now the truth is overrated, tell lies out the gate

Nine: Polarise the people, controversy is the game. It don't matter if they hate you if they all say your name

Ten: the world is yours, step out on a stage to a round of applause. You're a liar, a cheat, a devil, a whore, and you sell seashells on the seashore"

This moves a tough one tho. It’s got two hiccups: hollering at a girl with a bf, and hollering at a girl in the workplace.

Smoove apes can pull off one of those 👆🏻 but it takes a real silverback to do both.

Honestly, if you can: pretend you don’t know she has a bf when you leave her your number and slide. This gives you a face saving reason to bail out if it’s not the move. 

Also, it don’t matter if she got bf op (from a her interest level standpoint). She’s either happy w the dude and doesn’t see any others or is just satisfied enough to not be unhappy while subtly shopping around for a greater happiness.

Life is short. Don’t be weird. Put yourself out there. Dude I played baseball w in high school just got brain tumor. You bet your ass he’d tell you to take a chance while you can.

Good luck"

You can't really tell it's there so as you get older you start putting on weight but don't really see it so it's typically ""meh"" and you continue to eat pizza for breakfast and beer for lunch. Once you hit 30ish, your packed full of visceral fat so it starts building up in other places. Men typically get it in the belly and women in the hips and thighs. 

Basically, you are now entering the phase in life where you are accelerating the process of your death. You need to watch calorie intake, exercise, stop eating fast food and switch from beer to water.  Welcome to middle age. The good news, though, is your joints will hold up under the new excessive weight for about 10 years. At 40, it all breaks down and your life is fucked and women will avoid you."

On a serious note, making good decisions when you're depressed is close to impossible. maybe in a few months reflect on if gambling is a problem you need to avoid or like me make self imposed rules around. When I get depressed I need to make the conscious choice to stay away from that, maybe i miss out on an opportunity, but when you're depressed it's hard to see things for what they really are. Get healthy bud you are the priority, the money follows :)"

But what does that mean in real terms? It's not possible for the world economy as it's understood, to simply grant people, e.g., $3m/share. There's no way to pay out on that or financial system that can support it. Moreover, it's paper wealth, the *supposed* value of the stock versus what people will pay for it is completely different... Everybody who owes out on the stock can simply default on their payment and the relevant government will probably say ""okay yeah that seems reasonable.""

The short squeeze already happened. The price went from ~$20 or whatever it was, to ~$500, in like a week. That was it, that was the squeeze. When institutions who *were betting on GameStop to go 100% bankrupt (to $0) lost their bets.* That was it."

Lmao who knew a hundred year old company with a market cap of 300 billion would not balloon to 500 in a few months. 
Who knew a company already trading at ath barely coming out of the pandemic would not continue to rally another 40%.

2021-05-15 14:14:11,wallstreetbets,"Well being that much, it's only a loss if you sell. I would honestly hang onto it until something happens to go back up. Unless it's something that isn't going to go back up. I haven't researched this stock. What I'm saying it dont lose hope, & with that much don't just let it go. That's a lot, that isn't worth the loss.
Edit: Oh Disney... its gotta go back up eventually Summer hasn't even really started yet. Besides that the pandemic crap still has people sketched out give it a while. Its a long term hold. Youll be straight fam. HODL"
2021-05-15 16:13:46,wallstreetbets,"Just one more example of following someone else off a cliff. No one can predict the future. A lot can go wrong. Embrace the stop loss. Know where you are getting out before you get in. Its called a plan. All great traders and investors have one for everything they do. 2 exit strategies.  One for when you get what you expect, (target) and one for when you don't ( stop loss). Its not complicated."

2021-05-15 10:04:02,wallstreetbets,I’d did tgat dumbass move just in time for the dot com bust.  It took a long time to recover what I lost
2021-05-15 10:51:38,wallstreetbets,Hold on to ur cash. Stock market Crash is soon go a happen with inflation rate going up plus stocks are at record high without any reason. I am waiting for a day like Mar20 to get my money in the market. Bye till then.

2021-05-15 11:15:52,wallstreetbets,"There are market/trading manipulation. Check if there are legal ways first before blame yourself. 
Anyways is not about good or bad investor you are but always try to keep gambling far from your investing, I see you buy a lot of contracts which is I can’t see any investment in here."
2021-05-15 11:28:53,wallstreetbets,Are there any tax writeoffs you can claim from this?
2021-05-15 11:41:21,wallstreetbets,F
2021-05-15 11:49:34,wallstreetbets,Next time just give me the $100K and I’ll kick you in the balls and you can have the same result
2021-05-15 11:56:30,wallstreetbets,"DIS will roar back next week based on their new sans mask guidance, ppl will flock to get vaxxed so they can enter. 180 EOW."
2021-05-15 12:02:50,wallstreetbets,Ouch... how does one carry on with life losing several years of my salary on a trade?
2021-05-15 12:04:58,wallstreetbets,Excellent work!
2021-05-15 12:09:52,wallstreetbets,"Apes, or something"

2021-05-15 12:21:55,wallstreetbets,"For that much money you should not have gone so far out of the money on calls.... DIS was like 180 before ER and you bought 280C with 3 months to expiration. You sir, are...special."
2021-05-15 12:35:41,wallstreetbets,"Wowwww dont hear many people talking about the ""roaring 20's"" these days. Coolidge!"
2021-05-15 12:36:11,wallstreetbets,"Not surprising that DIS went down, I dumped the rest of my shares last month after buying slightly above 100 last year. I might get back in. The Mouse can’t lose, really.

280 call was glorious but man what a gamble. I hope you can recover from this.

Streaming, post-pandemic optimism - dude that was priced in a long time ago."

2021-05-15 12:54:21,wallstreetbets,Damn gotta shit on it now
2021-05-15 13:00:24,wallstreetbets,No reason DIS should be worth more than pre-pandemic price. And it’s going back there in time.
2021-05-15 13:14:31,wallstreetbets,I’ll buy now and maybe they will.
2021-05-15 13:57:56,wallstreetbets,I love loss porn ❤️
2021-05-15 14:12:19,wallstreetbets,This helps me feel better about my $GME losses
2021-05-15 14:21:39,wallstreetbets,Oh my !!!!!
2021-05-15 14:25:20,wallstreetbets,Ouch
2021-05-15 14:39:38,wallstreetbets,You only need Disney to go up 194 billion to get to that $280
2021-05-15 14:49:20,wallstreetbets,"You had over 100k for this play and you dropped it all into short dated super far OTM calls? Fek dude at least buy some LEAPS, would have printed long term."
2021-05-15 14:52:41,wallstreetbets,Oof!
2021-05-15 14:59:56,wallstreetbets,"I mean you still got some time but im gonna be honest, $120 change isnt really likely lol maybe if something crazy awesome was announced but not from an earnings report"
2021-05-15 15:04:07,wallstreetbets,"New to the game, not clear on options and premiums, so asking honestly and naively: How much actual money did he pay out and lose?"
2021-05-15 15:05:48,wallstreetbets,You have 2 months left. Sack up.
2021-05-15 15:06:31,wallstreetbets,"Impressive loss porn.   You got this though. Don’t give up, learn from it and grow."
2021-05-15 15:32:51,wallstreetbets,"you got til July 16, youll most likely break even and even get a profit. But im surprised you made this call, If im gonna risk anything over 10k i wait for a huge red day and buy ITM calls"
2021-05-15 15:34:14,wallstreetbets,I’m tryna figure out if any type of gain was even an objective?? Or was is the complete opposite??
2021-05-15 15:36:33,wallstreetbets,2 months left for the big rebound ;)))
2021-05-15 15:46:15,wallstreetbets,"Contact sleepy Joe, he is giving away money to people with hardship 😎"
2021-05-15 15:57:44,wallstreetbets,bro just double down
2021-05-15 16:05:10,wallstreetbets,"this is why i never bother to learn options.
you get rich quick BUT also go broke quick."
2021-05-15 16:07:39,wallstreetbets,THERES STILL TIME🥲
2021-05-15 16:13:54,wallstreetbets,Why didn’t you just buy a 100 puts con to match the calls you buy. You will always break even. My opinion for every 5 calls buy 1 put. Vise versa
2021-05-15 16:16:36,wallstreetbets,Why TF buy so far OTM??
2021-05-15 16:18:54,wallstreetbets,Diagnosis - Moderate mental retardation.
2021-05-15 16:26:49,wallstreetbets,This was a retarded bet to begin with
2021-05-15 16:31:11,wallstreetbets,Ayyy
2021-05-15 16:54:38,wallstreetbets,"It’s okay, you just like the stock"
2021-05-15 16:54:42,wallstreetbets,It’s only a loss if you sell
2021-05-15 16:55:43,wallstreetbets,Still a year to go
2021-05-15 17:12:47,wallstreetbets,Buy $eMax and everything will be okay!❤️
2021-05-15 17:25:12,wallstreetbets,"Most of you don’t know much about options.  You have till July.  $DIS is expected to do better in the Summer.  Hope is not lost yet since the expiration is July.  If $DIS continues to move the way it did yesterday going to mid June, your position might be worth $1 per contract, and you will be able to turn your loss to a profit.

Next time you want to hold a position through earnings, get both calls and puts with at least 6 months expiration.  You will never lose on a trade like this.  Time will help you get out at a profit. IMO.

Good luck!"
2021-05-15 17:45:10,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry, it's not like that's a big chunk of your life savings or anything"
2021-05-15 18:10:31,wallstreetbets,"Hey, get a load of this retard."
2021-05-15 18:27:08,wallstreetbets,I like this because my mom says totally mean things too.
2021-05-14 22:35:04,wallstreetbets,Don’t buy options if you don’t have the money to exercise it
2021-05-14 20:23:31,wallstreetbets,Oh my lord... Whos mans is this
2021-05-15 04:56:55,wallstreetbets,Could he just print more?
2021-05-15 15:59:15,wallstreetbets,Solar FLARE 🙌
2021-05-15 17:43:49,wallstreetbets,I haven’t even finished the first sentence and I’m crying in laughter 🤣
2021-05-15 03:10:16,wallstreetbets,Dear god they’ll hit the moon if they buy onlyfans.
2021-05-14 20:19:48,wallstreetbets,$0.73/contract on that far OTM on a $300b+ market cap stonk? Most of that loss is IV crush. Brutal.
2021-05-14 23:08:21,wallstreetbets,"I think what happened is he did expert level technical analysis and drew a line from the lows in late october to the highs in late december, and followed the line to find out how much disney would be worth in july. brilliant"
2021-05-14 20:03:27,wallstreetbets,"Kinda? There was no way. Maybe if it was a small company

At this price the market cap would be 500B, making it larger than Visa lmao"
2021-05-14 22:26:37,wallstreetbets,No shit. This dude thought the boomer retirement fund was going to go up $100 in a couple months because of Disney+?? lmao. I'd love to know the IV when he bought these.
2021-05-14 20:28:43,wallstreetbets,Straight up my brain is melting at the cost of those contracts. It will be $280 once the parks reopen at 100%/cruises start sailing/all the awesome new content and price hikes hit Disney+... but that's Q3 best case.
2021-05-15 00:40:32,wallstreetbets,And specifically a year when their most profitable ventures were either completely closed or significantly reduced.
2021-05-15 10:58:45,wallstreetbets,"Probably looked at Deere tractor's chart and thought if a HUNDRED and 80 year old company can \~triple in a year, a double for disney should be no problem (BTW OP, guess who has earnings this friday?)"
2021-05-15 11:54:37,wallstreetbets,I mean I wouldn't bet for the mouse doubling but target did double and the some but totally different markets and businesses
2021-05-14 22:44:13,wallstreetbets,"I’m in tears. Lmao. Little retard tears, but tears none the less. Lol"
2021-05-14 21:39:48,wallstreetbets,I'm gonna sell these rights right back to Disney when this is all over
2021-05-14 21:45:32,wallstreetbets,"Yes, my theory was that boomers were forced to stay home, save money, and be denied quality time with grand children on the heels of being retired... So when things opened up in 2021, they were gonna go crazy at the parks and Disney could charge whatever they wanted while still selling out parks/hotels..... Turns outtttt I was wrong with all my logical thinking"
2021-05-14 21:29:38,wallstreetbets,Who knows who will come to save me? Stares intently at the WOOD in the fire
2021-05-14 20:14:01,wallstreetbets,Is this Ford or

2021-05-14 21:42:14,wallstreetbets,"In February, I figured we'd be done with masks and Disney would be the clear benefactor of a reopening economy.... Apparently, being validated but not with money is what is called a ""hallow victory"" and my pride is wounded"

2021-05-14 22:03:41,wallstreetbets,BoA said the rise in lumber isn't applicable for the rise in value of my new cardboard box

2021-05-14 22:00:04,wallstreetbets,No need to panic. I did that days ago
2021-05-14 22:13:56,wallstreetbets,It felt right when we were hitting ATH and the CEO said vaccine rollouts would be a game changer.... Boy was he right!
2021-05-14 22:27:43,wallstreetbets,Might I remind you that this was a wager done months ago when both Disney and I felt as strong as the Gates marriage?
2021-05-14 22:42:32,wallstreetbets,when things were going well
2021-05-14 22:42:11,wallstreetbets,I thought I had the sleeper cell stock... the $ZM before the pandemic
2021-05-14 23:50:13,wallstreetbets,I'm still up over 400% on the year after this gigantic L... You gotta swing when you think you're right. I don't see another alternative

2021-05-14 23:34:23,wallstreetbets,"would normally roll my eyes at people who never take a chance, but that username is making me blush"

2021-05-15 01:10:50,wallstreetbets,Lmao and a huge market cap like Disney.
2021-05-15 09:41:38,wallstreetbets,By taking chances others dont
2021-05-15 09:52:38,wallstreetbets,I bought this a few months ago when I assumed investors cared about a good business who would benefit greatly on the reopening
2021-05-15 09:56:52,wallstreetbets,This made me giggle
2021-05-15 10:02:12,wallstreetbets,Supply and demand... Saw a bunch of rich people sidelined for a year and assumed Disney was in the perfect position to capitalize on it in summer 2020
2021-05-15 10:03:29,wallstreetbets,"I'm confused, why do people think I lost this all in one day? I bought this months ago before we broke 200 and it felt good"
2021-05-15 11:09:47,wallstreetbets,Amen. It's just money
2021-05-15 11:11:35,wallstreetbets,I bought these months ago on a huge gamble that we'd be done with Rona by May
2021-05-15 15:26:04,wallstreetbets,I'm finally the greatest

2021-05-14 22:05:25,wallstreetbets,Taken under advisement
2021-05-14 22:05:09,wallstreetbets,It's hard to be upset at the world when your portfolio drops 50% from being up over 2000%...  Gotta take a swing sometimes

2021-05-15 09:50:34,wallstreetbets,Do you really think they'd let me drive after this?
2021-05-15 09:51:53,wallstreetbets,I still don't know what this means
2021-05-15 09:53:20,wallstreetbets,"Would have been nice, but probably not considered a ""bet"" when I bought these a few months ago"

2021-05-15 09:58:37,wallstreetbets,"You're not wrong... I'm long on Disney too, but really believed the demand would look like nothing we had ever seen before for summer"
2021-05-15 10:03:41,wallstreetbets,Pretty bad
2021-05-15 10:04:48,wallstreetbets,"An optimist! I knew I'd find one eventually... People don't know this but my mother was never proud of me, even when I did make over 100k"
2021-05-15 10:05:11,wallstreetbets,July even. Let the games begin!!
2021-05-15 10:05:58,wallstreetbets,Would have been bolder if I had won

2021-05-15 10:16:40,wallstreetbets,Disney will boom at some point.. just not in the timeline I had hoped when I bought these. Still longhorn Disney which will make up for it
2021-05-15 11:10:27,wallstreetbets,My word is my bond
2021-05-15 11:10:47,wallstreetbets,See it. Own it.

2021-05-15 15:15:27,wallstreetbets,Why would I give anyone else satisfaction?

2021-05-15 06:54:59,wallstreetbets,"“Most of that loss is IV crush”

Literally all of it is IV because it’s OTM. Like that’s the definition of a extrinsic value"

2021-05-15 08:58:03,wallstreetbets,After they ducked me around for months I did lawyer up.   Mickey still  fought it until we had a trial date set.  I had to make flight arrangements and take time off work.  A couple days before the trial date they finally settled .  After what the lawyer got I barely had money to afford the bills.  I should of sued for a fucking payday but I just wanted my bills paid.  Mickey has a huge team of lawyers and will try to fuck you until they know they are cornered and will lose.  Will never forget and hate that fucking rat.
2021-05-14 21:58:51,wallstreetbets,60% rise in value in 2 month for DIS is likely but hard
2021-05-14 20:17:10,wallstreetbets,Ha!
2021-05-14 20:09:22,wallstreetbets,Oh no! Lol damn…hang in there man
2021-05-14 20:18:34,wallstreetbets,Might have had a chance if they reinstated dividend at like 4%
2021-05-14 21:50:18,wallstreetbets,"Ehhh, yeah, I got swept up at the ATH a couple of months ago"
2021-05-14 21:48:53,wallstreetbets,Well you definitely should not have felt that way.
2021-05-14 21:51:33,wallstreetbets,"Everybody here learns their lesson the hard way, it’s expected.

DIS 3/19/20 $80 put RIP 💀. That’s the lesson I learned the hard way. IV crush was my 2nd lesson because I had never seen IV like the March drop before. Even lost money on calls from buying the OTM dip back then"
2021-05-14 22:21:40,wallstreetbets,options trading isn’t for everyone...I’m not new but I’m still a god awful trader. lost 10K today from averaging down on short positions (still unrealized)
2021-05-14 22:18:55,wallstreetbets,"I mean hey Im with ya I’ve Been down on my portfolio for quite some time too, Disney isn’t a bad stock either, they’ve just made some bad decisions recently so it’s just kinda sittings 
Best luck to you in the future!"
2021-05-15 12:42:10,wallstreetbets,Very sorry to hear that. I'm here to talk to if anything
2021-05-14 23:16:36,wallstreetbets,Trump was a pos but damn i miss his market lmao.. this is the way
2021-05-15 15:57:02,wallstreetbets,"He had several out of the money call options betting on positive earnings report for Disney. He lost $50k instantly, and it was 99% margin"
2021-05-15 12:06:41,wallstreetbets,"A flair is like that colored text you see next to some people’s usernames and usually the mods make them pretty funny and based on the person’s actual history. A phrase I’ve seen around here is “don’t fuck with the mouse” meaning don’t bet against DIS because they are always successful over the long term. In this case you bet on the mouse, (albeit a little too majorly) and got effed."
2021-05-15 19:36:37,wallstreetbets,Never gonna catch you :-)
2021-05-15 10:22:51,wallstreetbets,"Don’t worry about the summer, when you are long with a stock like DIS you can’t go wrong :)"
2021-05-15 10:13:53,wallstreetbets,"That was never going to happen, where do you think the extra 150 Billion in market cap was going to come from?"
2021-05-15 15:43:48,wallstreetbets,"Actually, I just analyzed this. No chance of breaking even, imo. You could cost average down, perhaps, but theta is 2/3 of delta right now, so you need $0.70/day just to break even.

I will buy DIS calls. But at as much lower strike. 200 or 210, likely."
2021-05-15 16:08:28,wallstreetbets,"it’s not another gamble, it’s simply adding more money to the existing bet"
2021-05-15 16:30:08,wallstreetbets,"Still, even buying these @ YTD-ATH is crazy low probability. Its too high market cap"
2021-05-15 19:20:20,wallstreetbets,How bout you send me the 10k and I'll double it instead throwing away in the trash?
2021-05-14 23:31:36,wallstreetbets,this is called wallstbets... not wallstwins or wallstspends.... take a swing or stay in the same place with slightly nicer things
2021-05-15 04:16:55,wallstreetbets,Yeah that's like a tiny fraction of GME.

2021-05-15 00:16:50,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, sure the drop to $80s in March 2020 made sense and to recover to $150 by end of year was nearly a best case scenario goal.  


Having it pop above that thanks to streaming was a god send. To think $280 is achievable in 2021 is insane."
2021-05-14 22:06:27,wallstreetbets,"Short term yes, you might be right. What's you PT time line? I really like the stonk based on the depth of their intellectual property and execution.. 100 years deep + pixar.  I'm having a hard time stringing sentences together because it's Friday and I'm high, but consider that they put out like 8/10 top grossing blockbusters in 2019. They own baby yoda, slave leia, iron man, peter parker, that autistic cocksucker dr. strage, sadness from inside out, plus all the legacy businesses like ships and theme parks. Then we have ESPN and they sprinkles some hints of sports gambling on the last earnings call. I like it. I like the stock."

There’s honestly no worst addiction IMO I’ve seen people literally take mortgages out and gamble it all away. They’d get paid go to the casino and blow their check ina hour come home no food, nothing for their family and do it again and again, and they never walk. 

I know you’re referring to a different type of gambling, but nonetheless there’s no worst addiction."
2021-05-15 00:41:41,wallstreetbets,"No, they only subsidize your concurring degeneracy. No reimbursements on previous degenerate behavior before the start of benefits."

What blows my mind is that horrible feeling of blowing the kids college fund or blowing your life savings and then repeating every day, every week, every paycheck. It’s almost unbelievable. It’s not like they don’t know the house always wins yet they will not stop, unless physically restrained. I think DraftKings has a feature where spouses can try to stop their spouse from blowing their life earnings"

2021-05-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC short squeeze imminent UWMC has a great jump yesterday and that has led to short borrow costs skyrocketing.

From \~ 33% on Monday to over 98% as of Today 05/14/2021 with very few shares even left to short.

The float pool is nearly depleted and that has led to a considerable run, in addition to a 300M stock buyback announced starting May 11th.

Ishbia is squeezing the shorts with a buyback just like RKT did with that special dividend.Jump on board!

Im up 15% on shares and 35% on 6/18 options from the sale Tuesday this week (post-earnings DUMP was a perfect buy in but we have plenty of room left to run).

I AM LETTING IT RIDE ON THE TENDIE TRAIN!

obligatory rockets:**🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** $UWMC **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**  


Iborrowshares shows ONLY 100 shares at 93.8% cost to borrow. Compare to 5k@1% for GME or 150k@73% for AMC.

At 12 I will start looking at the new exit strategy.

At 14 I will get ready to sell when the rocket slows. 

If it doesn't hit 12 short term I will hold long as I am sure 12-15 is reasonable in 2022. 

Then I will rebuy the dip after post squeeze mean reversion. 

I like the stock and UWMC is a great long value play outside of a short squeeze. I don't want my long to get derailed by this squeeze, just make some cash and reinvest in a good company."

The buyback is more of a tool used to maintain share price rather than shooting it to the moon. For example weeks ago, short sellers were able to push us around and run the share price into the ground ... to very low levels btw, trying that now, would likely result in Matt stepping in and setting price floor that he sees fair to purchase shares at meaning they won't be able to drive the price into the ground anymore.

Matt is very competitive, I'm hoping he shows how competitive he really is next week.

Also, he sold the shares at 10 dollars months ago when he enter the nasdaq as a spac, so buying the shares back at anything under 10, is theoretically profit made. 

In my opinion, it won't ever go near ATL again and congrats to those who were lucky enough to buy there."

2021-05-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$DASH - Even your wife's boyfriend haters Dashing Doordash is a food delivery company that IPO'd last December at a $37 BILLION market cap. After multiple valuation rounds, it opened at $102.00, from which it rallied up to north of $180 on opening day. With an ATH within recent months up to $250+, the stock became fatter than a swamp possum with the mumps, bleeding down until $110, new low since IPO. Today, it rallied to $140. Here's a quick rundown of DASH history, followed by why this garbage ass stock will drown faster than Bill Gates in a sea of pussy upon the closing out of his recent marital transactions. 

Dec 9 2020 - Doordash ($DASH), food delivery services company with larger market share than competitors (UBER, GRUB etc.) IPO's and opens on secondary market (us retards buying micro-cap growth stocks with revenue projections more bullishIT than me losing my virginity to Ariana Grande and paying for Robinhood's order flow while doing it) at $180 USD.

Jan 2021 - Stock hits new low of $140, well, cuz it's dogshit and wsb bought calls (not true). Meanwhile, your wife's boyfriend shorted it (true) and made enough money to plant hairs on Cramer's head.

February - New ATH after GME saga at ~$250. This is when Warren Buffet opened his secret position of $DASH puts. He told me.

Feb 25 - Dash reports earnings, biggest revenue in history due to COVID, but... $-2.75 EPS, misses estimates by like 300%. Begins to dip.

March - Early lock-up expiry (lol) + tech/growth correction. Dash dips and bleeds.

April 28 - rallies all the way back to $165, then the news drops -> https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-us-labor-secretary-says-most-gig-workers-should-be-classified-2021-04-29/ DASH, GRUB, UBER, LYFT all take a hit on this day forward.

May 13 - Stock bleeds until this point to a new low of $110. Earnings report after market. Misses EPS again, but raises guidance. Future not entirely certain, but Dash isn't going anywhere. Highest revenue quarter ever, yet still lost money. 

May 14 (today) - Rallies up to 25% intra-day, sitting at $142 as I write this. One of the biggest pops of today, according to finviz. 


Why this garbage is primed to burn past today's rally - 

- Economy is going to open and inflation is coming. CPI report with the newest high since '08 and highest monthly jump pattern since 1960 or some shit, when your grandaddys were eating crayons to set the tone for his successors (you). That means less dashers and more people actually living life in the summer in the U S of A first time since the pandemic. 

- Had a breakout year where revenues more than 3x'd and still didn't make any money like GME bag holders, same with yesterday's earnings report for Q1 - still didn't make any freaking profits.

- Ongoing upheaval with legislative forces regarding the classification of its' employees as actual employees instead of ""gig workers"" who take it up the ass with no benefits and stability. Will have to pull money out the ass to pay up when push comes to shove. https://www.wired.com/story/uber-uk-drivers-workers-not-employees/

- Rallied 20%-25% TODAY after the revenue beat on earnings - still missed EPS (and lost money ofc), but some aNaLySt UpGrAdEs followed since last night - Wells Fargo to overweight, and Youssef Squali from Truist Securities upgraded to Buy at $185. You can look at his most recent price targets. https://i.imgur.com/NUPuFry.png (LOL) hint: I stopped reading at BABA 290.

And last but NOT LEAST...

- Doordash's FINAL lock-up expiry is coming in just about 3 weeks from now, here's the SEC filing https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm

here's the relevant photo showing the exact date, since December 9 - https://i.imgur.com/TCicUGK.png

This is Doordash's FINAL lock-up expiry on June 8, which basically has no restrictions around Rule 144 (things that exist to not plummet the stock). All the stocks that have been restricted and/or privately held, barring very unique and special conditions, will be let loose into the secondary/retail market, where us retards have been privileged to gobble up at a 40% premium to the initial IPO. Given current numbers, Dash is expecting to increase their current public float of ~150 million shares, to the ENTIRETY of ~300 million shares outstanding, with some extra ~30 million bound to underwriters or something. The float is about to increase at minimum 25%, at most, about 50%. To say the least, you can expect some profit taking for this garbage stock which, while it may survive, turns no profits at temporary record-breaking numbers aided by the worst pandemic in history during which had TRIPLED its' revenue.

positions: https://i.imgur.com/T73C5UY.png May 28 135 puts, I would buy more but I'm short on buying power atm.

As always, DO YOUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE, then short this garbage below your 4'6 standing figure on heels. I'm not a financial advisor.

**EDIT title mistake was cuz ur wife was distracting me**"

2021-05-15 00:11:23,wallstreetbets,"You are on the money!  DASH is a garbage stock. In fact it would make more money having drivers pick up garbage. Double dipping on the transaction and they still can turn a profit and during a pandemic where customers were readily available and did take advantage. So there is no way in hell any of these delivery services will ever make money. I apologize for my lack of eloquence. Delivery should be maintained by the restaurants themselves the same as healthcare should be community based.  And, by the way lead for them to both be better services and low and behold......make money!  

There is not any food....not anywhere that is worth waiting for and then consuming after sitting in a Dashers vehicle in transit for more than 30 minutes!!!

Analysts still don't believe $PLTR can achieve their 4B'25 revenue goal. They're projecting rev of 3.37B by 2025 end. My models shows 4B'25 revenue is discounted to $20 current price with 12% discount rate.

While management continue to believe the 30% CAGR is just the BARE MINIMUM growth rate.  
(1.1B'21 \* 1.3\^5 = 4B'25). As a result, 4B'25 goal is just a conservative estimate by Palantir management.

2021-05-15 08:51:48,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha, I was interpreting your comment “1.1bn ’21” as 2021 revenue.

I’m long PLTR so I’m betting on magikarp here as well 🦍📈"
2021-05-14 21:51:31,wallstreetbets,"for long term buy and hold? dude, this is WSB. 

this sub is so fucked since the GME but it originally stands for puts or calls and FD

if you want rational convo, there are other subs for it"
2021-05-15 00:10:22,wallstreetbets,Beta of 2 is high af but hey do ya thang
2021-05-15 13:34:28,wallstreetbets,Some common sense right there!
2021-05-15 09:01:29,wallstreetbets,my bad. Thank you
2021-05-14 22:31:50,wallstreetbets,"Why not both? I killed it in GME and there’s plenty of room in WSB for rational discussion and longer term thinking. It’s actually the best of both worlds. 

I’m not here talking about AAPL, GE or anything. PLTR is a high growth undervalued stock. Depending on market conditions discussing PLTR could be like discussing GME IN December 2020. Maybe not as big but you know what I mean."
2021-05-15 04:14:22,wallstreetbets,like i said i didn't check the numbers. If they have zero debt a beta of 1.5 will be enough. all i'm saying here is that a discount rate of 12% is realistic
2021-05-15 05:55:16,wallstreetbets,Undervalued?  Their revenue doesn’t even come close to justifying the market cap lol.  I think they could blow up in a few years like people say but this stock feels like mass internet hype to me more than anything.  Fancy data dashboards that require complete customization for each individual client just doesn’t seem like a trillion dollar company to me but we’ll see.
2021-05-15 10:33:02,wallstreetbets,"Well their market cap is around 37 billion so they aren’t valued as a trillion dollar company. I think their revenue coupled with their profit margin and growth rate make them attractive. They are much more than a dashboard company. They have important government contracts too which, if they can hold those, gives some stability to they income as well."
2021-05-15 11:48:22,wallstreetbets,I’ve seen a lot of the people hyping pltr project it as a trillion dollar company which I find just pure hype.  They’re pretty close to a fancy dashboard company.  Those important government contracts aren’t generating much revenue so hopefully that changes over the years.
2021-05-15 13:57:16,wallstreetbets,It will never be a trillion dollar company unless they buy a company worth a trillion dollars lol. But I think there is value at these prices and the government contracts aren’t amazing but there are a solid foundation as they expand into corporate work. From what I have read on here from those that have worked with them they provide very impactful outcomes for companies. And they are growing at a 50% clip for years.
2021-05-15 14:41:08,wallstreetbets,"I agree I also think it has value, I think I’m just being overly harsh in it because I see it name dropped a ton like something that’s about to moon. I see them going up a bunch but not in a short timeframe but I’m also dumb so what do I know.  It just seems like one that’ll be awesome in a few years, but people talk about it like it’ll moon tomorrow."

2021-05-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Using data visualizations to identify suspicious behavior on WSB Note: You can find interactive versions of visualizations for tickers [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/comments/nc9zqz/wsb_audience_graphs/) if you'd like to look deeper into the data, I just did a brief analysis here of the most obvious conclusions.

As some of you know I’ve been working with data on WallStreetBets discussion for well over a year now, and I wanted to share a visualization I made the combines a few different metrics. The goal was to visualize differences between the holders of different stocks and to try to identify instances of users attempting to manipulate discussion in a bad faith manner.

In order to do this, I went through ticker by ticker and looked at all accounts who had mentioned the ticker in the last 3 years. I then went through those accounts and looked at a few different metrics. The first thing I looked at was how many days it had been since they had first commented on WSB. I also looked at what proportion of their comments on WSB contained references to the ticker in question. Lastly, I calculated the sentiment of their comments mentioning the ticker.

A visualization of all of those metrics looks something like this:

[GME audience graph](https://preview.redd.it/s6rkc7yke4z61.png?width=2016&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a854d11b0dc90961d39fd191d1c957282861554)

This makes it quite easy to compare the holders of different stocks, for example we can compare the above visualization for GME with the visualization below for AMD. This provides the immediate and obvious conclusion that fewer newcomers to WSB have been discussing Lisa Su, as evidenced by the more rightward leaning distribution of points along the x-axis.

[AMD audience graph](https://preview.redd.it/spxfexoie4z61.png?width=2016&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaf73292bc2d93feda0a4cfaef0acccb1074f949)

But it also allows you to identify attempts at manipulating discussion. For example, this large dark dot in the upper left of the GME graph looks rather sus. On a quick hover we can see that one user has been talking about GME an awful lot and doesn’t seem to have had very nice things to say.

[Sus](https://preview.redd.it/8gjv0itue4z61.png?width=1732&format=png&auto=webp&s=93f568296f1c6324c18d8f505b4465f142483721)

Looking at their profile, the math seems to check out.

[Their profile](https://preview.redd.it/fkgdsmure4z61.png?width=2144&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e596d35c7b50be174f5f6ca67ea6b5b87d73597)

It’s worth noting that this post isn’t meant to insinuate that there's a ton of people out there exhibiting this type of behavior. On the contrary, accounts like the one shown above were quite rare and if there are people participating in the discussion threads in bad faith, it’s in a less blatantly spammy fashion.

If there's interest, I will make an anonymized version of these visualizations publicly available."

so what's the instruction?"
2021-05-15 06:33:03,wallstreetbets,what keywords do you look for to measure sentiment?
2021-05-15 13:29:11,wallstreetbets,Just a thought.  I wonder if you can correlate any of that data with the price movement of the underlying stock in a way that it could be used as an indicator in the future for other things?  That would be something interesting to figure out🤔
2021-05-14 22:03:52,wallstreetbets,So how can we discern what is going to be the positive out come to be profitable with these manipulation efforts.

2021-05-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Relative Rotation Graphs: 5/14/2021   

Greetings Gents,

 First off, this is not professional financial advice …invest at your own peril.

Quick explanation: 

This post will be analyzing relative rotation graphs for daily and weekly steps.

Daily steps most beneficial for a 3 month or less trend. Weekly analysis tends towards the +3ish month strategies, but favors longer timeframes.

The method utilized for developing these graphs is the Julius de Kempenaer method which plots the relative strength momentum against the relative strength ratio for a sector.

Got it? No? Well here’s a 45-minute video. Enjoy:

Discussion:

**What’s a good bet in the short term?**

*Bullish companies in XLP like Kellogg (K), Altria (MO), and Viatris (VTRS) which are improving or have strong trajectories towards leading. The sector is support in both the short term and long term with positive trajectories.*

https://preview.redd.it/wp6qp7moc4z61.png?width=411&format=png&auto=webp&s=cab2399b4bf00e90527025500c62479c49872260

**What’s a good bet in the long term?**

*Consumer staples (XLP) look strong in both the near and short term. Materials (XLB) is also looking strong.*

**Anything that looks like a good bet in the short term, but bad in the long term?**

*Energy and Financials are looking great right now. But their momentum is quickly dying off.*

**Anything that looks like a good bet in the long term, but bad in the short term?**

*Short term Real Estate momentum is slowing but has a ton of long-term momentum. Materials also have strong momentum in the long term, but there looks to be a bit of wavering in the short term. We might see a slight correction in materials followed by a little acceleration.*

**""This is a Casino Sir"" - My Bets/Positions:**

K – PCS - 6/18

MO – PCS - 6/18

VTRS – Long Call - 6/18

XLP – ZEBRA (Zero Extrinsic value Back RAtio) - 9/17

OXY – IC with bearish skew – 6/18

I'll also probably open some positions on companies within the XLB and XLRE sectors...but TBD on that.

FAQs:

**What are your strikes?**

*Shouldn’t matter. Pick your own strikes based on your personal risk tolerance.* 

**Why 24 bars?**

*Because I felt like it. And because it gives approximately a 6-month view on the weekly and about a month on the daily. Seems fine to me for getting a sense of direction.*

**Where are the FDs?**

*Not my thing, but that doesn’t mean you can’t do it based on this info. To each their own.*

**What about sHoRt InTeReSt???**

*No.*

I think it was August or September of 2000. I was 24 years old and just took out a $20k second mortgage. Then Monday after receiving the check I went in to my broker (back when you actually took checks into you broker) and bought stock. Then margined the stock to buy more. Then that Thursday I woke up and saw that the stock dropped from $72 to $46 and I received a phone call. A margin call. Had to sell most of it at that loss to cover it. Bankruptcy followed shortly. Swore from that day on I'd never touch margin again. I learned. Some people don't."

2021-05-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$KSU Acquisition mini bagger opportunity This is going to be light for DD (my first), but I'm not relying on anything but this catalyst.

KCS Railroad is in negotiations with two Canadian railway companies. Current best offer on the table is buyout of $325/share from Canada National. Current price of KSU is ~$311/share. This means there are some gains to be had on sub $320 strike options. 

DO NOT GO EARLY EXPIRY. I bought a 5/21 $310c that I will most likely have to unload at a loss. Need this a few months out for final negotiations. Price per share could go up. Interest is high for both bidders as this could give them a rail system that spans Canada, US, and Mexico.

Bonus: transportation should be a strong sector with recovery.

This will not have meme stock retard strength, but should net a tidy profit once the merger is approved. 

There is a small risk of regulatory rejection of the acquisition,  but I think this risk is smallish with a Canadian company (opinion not based on anything but gut feeling)

Positions: At the moment that one stupid 5/21 310c. Need to free up some cash from my ET, RGR, or mouse plays. Eyeing July 310c or a little later @$315 hopefully by EOD.

Regulation SHO is a list of securities that failed to settle in the previous five trading days. This list does not specify the cause of the failed settlements.

As of 5/13/2021, UWMC is on the list for straight 12 days, since 4/28/2021.

Do your own DD. Look that the short interests . The LOW FLOAT.  Of course short going to cover if more people start buy and hold. Plus 300 million stock BUY BACK shows UWMC CEO care about the stock price and its shareholders.  Iam Currently banking 1800 a quarter. Short squeeze the better. If not i can still pay my bills with the dividend. Think smart. Stock market is shit and this is a safe place to put your money. The choice is yours. I sleep good that night.

2021-05-15 00:04:02,wallstreetbets,"A few thoughts in response to your concerns about the future for mortgage companies:

* Millenials having families and migration from big cities to small cities, suburbs, rural areas, etc.. will keep the demand for home purchases high for at least a few years. 
* A ton of new homes will need to be built to meet the demand. In the meantime, existing home values will continue to climb due to competition for homes.
* Rising home prices will entice people to do cash out refinances.
* Higher home prices means more revenue per mortgage. 
* There are still a lot of people that didn't refinance in 2020 due to various reasons. For example, millions of people lost jobs and millions of businesses lost money so many wouldn't have the required income to refinance.
* Low interest rates will continue to encourage people to use mortgages to buy rental properties."

2021-05-15 11:05:28,wallstreetbets,"There's 2 parts to a mortgage...  The mortgage itself and then the servicing of the mortgage.  

Mortgages are bundled together in what are called asset backed securities (ABS).  This ABS are sold to institutional investors, typically pension funds. 

The servicing is done by a loan servicers, the company you make your mortgage payment to. The servicer is contractually obligated to make the payment to the investor. 

The mortgage company that originated the loan, they use a warehouse line of credit to originate and borrow against until they are able to sell off the mortgage."

2021-05-14 22:12:28,wallstreetbets,As of GME and AMC are better companies to invest in. The housing market is still booming and all inventory is being sold on the spot. You need to close on your mortgage FAST in order to be in the game and UWMC is your best bet to secure financing fast

2021-05-14 20:23:11,wallstreetbets,"Man this comment just really highlights how little you understand the mortgage industry

Refis aren’t where the moneys at. They’re more expensive to acquire and suffer from margin compression moreso than purchases. And name DOES matter with purchase mortgages (try getting a Rocket prequalified offer accepted in any hot RE market). When rates go up, who suffers? The lenders most dependent on refinance business. The call center refi sweatshops will see M&A by the buttload this year. The companies that have always been steadily closing purchases will see a decrease in total volume but will just return to the normal production they did prior to 2020. Mortgage business is cyclical, never bet on a refi shop to last very long. But the top purchase lenders? They’ll survive even 8% rates because historically people don’t really quit buying homes because of rates."

2021-05-14 22:47:07,wallstreetbets,selling puts ties up funds though; also if things go south you end up getting assigned shares that you might not want
2021-05-14 22:22:10,wallstreetbets,"Sorry that is opposite.  It means that they are stuck with a bunch of 2.75% loans when the going rate of loans is 4.00%.  They have a huge opportunity cost being saddled with the low yield loans.

I am not familiar with buying and selling mortgages, but I have to assume that it is the same as a bond.  The value of bonds on the market has an inverse relationship with rates.  As rates go up, value of the bond goes down."
2021-05-14 22:14:32,wallstreetbets,"You proved my point:

""The companies that have always been steadily closing purchases will see a decrease in total volume but will just return to the normal production they did prior to 2020.""

2020 and Q1 2021 were boom times.  They will go down.  That's exactly my point.  The future is worse than the present which is why I don't love mortgage stocks.  But it's worse because there won't be many refi's because people aren't going to refi their 2.75% mortgage when rates are 4.00%.

I want to invest in companies that have a better outlook than to just ""survive."""

2021-05-14 23:26:14,wallstreetbets,"I definitely hear ya.  But, what are the probabilities?"
2021-05-14 22:28:09,wallstreetbets,"It’s actually the opposite, as rates go up the value of that lower rate portfolio goes up because it’s less likely to be refinanced and has a longer “shelf life” if you will. A loan that’s likely to be refinanced isn’t worth as much because they’ll only get a year or so of payments before it’s refinanced. If that servicer needs capital they can offload their portfolio. Retention is also a huge business in itself. One that Rocket is actually amazing at, as shitty as they are in other regards.

The servicing rights themself is a money maker. The actual internet earned is secondary. A 4% loan might make you solid interest for a few months, but it’s getting refinanced immediately the next time rates dip to 3.5 or lower. And that 2.5-2.75 is pretty unlikely to ever be refinanced so it’s essentially guaranteed consistent money."
2021-05-14 22:15:19,wallstreetbets,Bruh if you don’t understand business cycles you’re beyond help
2021-05-15 03:53:13,wallstreetbets,"Not sure about you, but whenever I sell puts, my brokerage requires me to hold the amount of cash needed to get assigned those puts. The cash is locked up and I literally can't use it for anything until I buy back the puts."
2021-05-14 23:17:35,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for your comment.   I appreciate the feedback. 

How is servicing rights the money maker?  All my loans had pretty big restrictions on fees that the servicer could charge.  Are they making more money than the interest rate?  If so, on my loans, it was very low.

Also, why would it matter if someone refi's?  The market for servicing is fairly robust, I am assuming, and so if someone refi's they can just buy other loans with higher yields if rates had gone up.  Why would mortgages be different than bond markets?  If mortgages were in an illiquid market, then that could be true, but I have a hard time seeing the mortgage market be illiquid.

If a servicer has to offload their portfolio and their loans are at 2.75% and the market rate for loans is 4%, then that servicer would need to pay a premium to prospective investors to get rid of their crappy 2.75% loans instead of the high yield 4% loans on the market that investors would want instead.  Thus the value of the portfolio would decrease as rates go up because they pay to get rid of them.  

How are mortgages defying yield values through servicing or service rights?"
2021-05-14 23:35:17,wallstreetbets,"They don’t charge the borrower the servicing fee, whoever holds the actual note pays that fee to the servicer. The actual servicing of loans has pretty low overhead so it can be pretty profitable on its own.

It matters if someone refis because when they refi, it’s likely with another investor. So whoever was making money off them before now makes zero.

The average life of a loan is around 7 years. Realistically that’s the longest term a lender will be able to profit off the interest and servicing. The higher a rate compared to the current market rate, the lower that life expectancy is. So there’s diminishing returns.

So in your example, the portfolio at 2.75% is way more likely to reach that 7 year mark than a portfolio at 4%. That 2.75% isn’t incredibly lucrative or enticing, but it’s about as close to guaranteed and stable as you can get.

Now if rates go higher say to 6%, then the scale starts tipping back the other direction and that 4% portfolio starts looking better than the 2.75% because both are likely to have high retention at that point and the actual rate starts being more valuable.

The main reason we didn’t see rates dip further last year is because like you said, there’s just a point where it’s just not an investment anyone wants to hold. Below 2% and it’s just not a good play, or so the market seemed to tell us."
2021-05-14 23:56:22,wallstreetbets,"Didn't know about servicers not holding the note.  Always thought they were the same but makes sense. 

Also makes sense for 7 years because that is when most interest is paid for loan on the amortization schedule.  

Appreciate the info.  Hope it squeezes for you and you make a ton.  I'll ride the way back down if it does."
2021-05-15 00:04:23,wallstreetbets,"I’m not even expecting a squeeze tbh lol

I think UWM is just a general good long term play with how low it’s been trading lately plus it’s got a nice dividend. I think they’ll come out ahead this year as other lenders get swallowed up through the usual M&A that happens every time rates rise. Especially if the housing inventory shortage starts to recover, UWM is in a great spot to be the number 1 purchase lender for 2021.

But that’s more boomerstock than WSB

Won’t complain if it does squeeze though, it’s been a brutal few weeks of continuously averaging down only for it to drop lower immediately after. The stock itself has been fuckin torture lol.

Either way, UWM has made me a shit ton of money this year already (I’m a broker myself). I just gotta quit giving that money right back to them by buying their stock 😂"
2021-05-15 00:16:13,wallstreetbets,"I figured you were in the industry with your responses.  I worked with a few brokers in 07-08 and they all lost everything in the collapse.  Then Dodd Frank changed the business completely.  It was a crazy time.

I totally agree that this is a good long term stock.  Over long run, it will always make money.  So many people keep thinking this is the next big exploding short term stock and I don't get that at all.  Mortgages won't have ""new"" developments to excite the markets.  They are slow and boring.  Rates are a big unknown now too.  FED says they'll stay low but I wonder if they'll have a harder time controlling them moving forward.

Good luck to you.  Thanks for the info about inner workings of mortgages and servicing!"
2021-05-15 00:28:39,wallstreetbets,"I got into the business around 2008 just as it was all crashing. I remember coworkers constantly freaking out and I just had no clue what was normal and what wasn’t because I was so new to it all lol. Kinda like being in a burning room but being unaware of it because you’d never seen fire before.

People making short term plays on mortgage companies, the irony of “mortgage” being Latin for “death pledge” is kinda funny…

I’m probably just old school, I invested in it because they’re hands down the best lender to work with as a broker. Leagues above just about everyone else currently. They’ve got some growing pains to work out (they grew their staff at a crazy fast pace so their underwriters aren’t super great just yet) but that’s part of being the one lender that actually hires staff to meet capacity. Every other lender drags their feet to hire new staff and just takes longer to close instead (some lenders were taking 4-5 months last year on refis where UWM was about 2 weeks). They consistently close loans at speeds that would’ve required a perfectly flawless file at other companies I’ve worked with previously."
2021-05-15 00:42:03,wallstreetbets,"Haha, that was my experience too but on the real estate side.  I got my license in Nov of 07.  After a little trial and error I started focusing on what was selling which was foreclosures and short sales.  Every other real estate agent was freaking out and had no idea what to do.  I thought the downturn was great because of all the foreclosures but I didn't know any other way.  I actually hated when foreclosures dried up and everything went back to normal.   Those were great times."

2021-05-15 05:01:34,wallstreetbets,"Watched the show a lot in college during the Bush years. Still very liberal on most issues. Noah has never been close to Stewart in the comedy department for me. Interesting personal story and he does make some nuanced points but his actual comedy chops are based on low hanging fruit (similar to current SNL) His Trump impression is just a poor man's Alec Baldwin impression mixed with a standard nasally voice shtick from Jr. high days.

Comedy in general has evolved and the mainstream newer gen guys are often trying to recreate acts we all remember from the old days vs leaning into the new styles."

In any other western democracy the Democrats would be a conservative party."
2021-05-15 09:42:12,wallstreetbets,"The fact you even ask that shows how much the media has won.

To answer your question.... Yes. Trump isn't even a conservative.  So, to ask if there are conservatives who don't like Trump is beyond ignorant. Most conservatives don't like Trump. He's a liberal New Yorker asshole. They only supported him because he was the only person up there, on any side, standing up for them and American society. Only one who cared about manufacturing jobs and blue collar jobs. Only one who railed against the hypocritical leftist ""elite"". Only one who called the media out for what they are. Only one who sought to protect our borders and not start any new wars. Only one who would stand up to the communists and radical leftists in government and society. The only one who wanted to keep America, America, and not a European fuckshow.

And he won in a landslide and the system couped him out.

Thats the problem with AMC they have too many shares diluting the price, and they issuing more and more. AMC at $12 has a cap of 5.8 billion. Price tag of $20 would be about 10 Billion or so. We could achieve this temporarily with a squeeze but on fundamentals it aint going to happen."

2021-05-15 16:13:34,wallstreetbets,Until amc issues even more shares. Can’t own the whole float if the float is constantly expanding. That’s the whole problem with the amc short squeeze.

2021-05-15 15:23:19,wallstreetbets,How are they pathetic for taking profits from AMC and rolling them into GME?lol
2021-05-14 20:35:06,wallstreetbets,I mean GME stop wasn't worth 25billion either but it reached that we are talking unconventional stocks here built around hype. Fundamentals aren't at play. Market cap is not a great indicator on this front because you're not factoring in FOMO.
2021-05-15 03:17:22,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I hear ya...and you’re most likely right, that said, amc has more than double the screens cinemark has...from an infrastructure point of view, I could see amc respond better than cinemark in a post-Covid world"

2021-05-15 09:39:12,wallstreetbets,Nowhere in my comment did I say it would only get to $100. I said it will jump to $50 then $100 and if the person sold at $20 they would not be happy. This things is a once in a lifetime opportunity for all of us. There is no telling how high it can get if we show solidarity and HOLD even when we see it rise to $5K and then $10K and then.......
2021-05-14 20:05:09,wallstreetbets,So...I'll hope until I think it's the top. Then cry when it goes higher after I'm out...like every other position I've ever held.
2021-05-15 00:14:47,wallstreetbets,"Or the board will decide to release 500 million shares with out a vote from the share holders.....

2021-05-15 16:17:22,wallstreetbets,Amc will not be issuing anymore shares that I’m aware the ceo is trying to fuck the guys that tried to shit on his company not help them
2021-05-15 15:38:48,wallstreetbets,My brain is smooth but I thought it was 450 mill
2021-05-15 01:41:40,wallstreetbets,"Well unfortunately you won’t get all of it, I only put a small portion in this as most my money is in a stock with real fundamentals. If there is a squeeze atleast I will be part of it, and right now it is looking promising, but still I don’t like you, because you are siding with the side that manipulated countless retail investors, or maybe you are one of the ones who go into this board to hate on short squeezes because you can’t afford one to happen, who knows. Either way fuck you"
2021-05-14 20:37:07,wallstreetbets,"No, you’re twisting my response. You said it should be trading at $50 regularly? That’s head in sand thinking."
2021-05-15 10:11:35,wallstreetbets,Valid point. I am invested so I hope it does good
2021-05-14 20:45:19,wallstreetbets,"Ya gotta stay informed on what’s happening with the stock. 
Lou vs Wall Street on YouTube he has great info and he’s funny as shit."
2021-05-15 02:15:16,wallstreetbets,Can you elaborate
2021-05-14 21:23:07,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the stock may not even squeeze and if it does I doubt 1k much less 500k😂😂😂"
2021-05-15 17:16:36,wallstreetbets,Yes they will. They recently approved even more shares to be issued. This company is a joke. They payed out nice bonuses to the executives and shit on the shareholders.
2021-05-15 15:39:48,wallstreetbets,"Thought you were talking about gme, disregard"
2021-05-15 01:48:02,wallstreetbets,"The market is indifferent and doesn't care of it takes money from rich or poor, smart or dumb. Good luck trying to time the market, let me know how that goes for you! 👍"
2021-05-14 20:39:54,wallstreetbets,It's not head in the sand thinking because like I said realistically you should be aiming for 50 dollars as TOP that doesn't mean I t will reach that number but it has the capacity to do so IMO. If were to hit 50 dollars and didn't fall off a cliff immediately after 75 dollars should be the next target but if you read what I said breaking the 20 dollars is more important and holding above that is the key. If I had to bet will it reach 50 dollars and stay there probably not do I think it can peak there it's a possibility
2021-05-14 20:03:50,wallstreetbets,I only like red butts...butt I guess by the time it's my turn they'll be just how I like em.

2021-05-15 14:30:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that last filling that everyone was all cheering for because you all thought they were no longer going to release 500 mil shares.

All that it did was remove the vote for the share holders.

The board ""took it off the table"" but further down the same filling says the board can bring it up again at their own discretion.

Basically saying that when the board brings it back up they don't need a shareholder meeting to vote on it."

That would take a market cap of greater then the world economy lmao, obviously it’s a joke, learn to laugh. Realistically it can go to the hundreds."
2021-05-15 17:38:06,wallstreetbets,You cannot be serious 😂😂 if you mean the 43 million that have been issued  they gave them more capital to make things worse for the hf and the ceo himself is a share holder I’m a retard but you sir take the cake
2021-05-15 15:40:21,wallstreetbets,I shall and have a great day my fellow ape
2021-05-15 01:52:09,wallstreetbets,"How the hell is me buying because I can see a squeeze one day me timing the market. Aren’t you the one trying to time the market since you are buying puts for what I am assuming is the short term? You are retarded, I hope the squeeze happens right away just to burn all of your money. Respectfully"
2021-05-14 20:48:21,wallstreetbets,[https://www.sharesoutstandinghistory.com/?symbol=amc](https://www.sharesoutstandinghistory.com/?symbol=amc) AMC CEO and management have completely bent over the shareholders and you think he's on your side. Valuations may not need to make sense to you and a squeeze but the volatility will cap potential peaks from the sheer number of shares out there which will cash the F out.

2021-05-15 14:59:22,wallstreetbets,Perhaps practice the canslim approach. We are nowhere near a market bottom just yet... It is okay to take your losses and put those into something else. Probably a cash position right now. I recently sold about 2 million dollars in stock and am just sticking in a cash position for the moment... Opportunities will come Don't be afraid to miss out on potential earnings because it's better to miss out on potential earnings than it is to just sit there and lose money. It's hard to come up with just a few reasons why the economy is going to improve anytime soon in a rapid fashion... But there are many many reasons why it will not and why we are in for a much for recession than most people want to admit.

2021-05-15 13:28:59,wallstreetbets,"As said I sure hope I am wrong but I for the love of my self cant grasp what you people see.

AMC was failing long before covid, short interest is rather low and the float is HUGE and saying ""huge"" is almost an understatement. Volume is up and the shorts could cover in one single day.

What am I missing?! what is it that you see that I Dont?! I seriously want to know because I've been researching this shit even since it became "" GME's retarded little sister"" and I just dont see it.

2021-05-15 16:49:04,wallstreetbets,"It's a reopening play, it's heavily shorted, and by the same people shorting GME.

When one goes, the other goes boom. Cost basis is slightly better for GME imo, since I think it's a true infinity squeeze, could potentially hit 60m or 100m.

AMC is still gonna squeeze though. Personally, I'm in both because I just want to burn some hedge funds. GME is definitely my war horse though."
2021-05-15 16:57:14,wallstreetbets,"How do you know it's the same people?

how do you know it's ""heavily"" shorted? edit: rather define ""heavily shorted"" to me.

2021-05-15 17:10:10,wallstreetbets,"AMC is trapped in a bit of a cycle that it shares with Gamestop. The two charts are showing overlapping patterns since January, ergo, likely the same algorithm. You can also dig through Melvin and Citadel's previous holdings. They've since ""closed their positions"", (aka holding calls or achieving a temporarily net-neutral position

First thing's first, a quick look at the iborrowdesk chart: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC

Borowing fee is ramping up, interest payments aren't cheap right now. They hid their short interest on AMC and GME, and if you're in GME you should understand.

January is repeating itself. Both on AMC and GME, so stay in your rockets if you're in already. You'll see."

2021-05-15 13:47:21,wallstreetbets,"That’s awesome to hear! I post a lot to Stocktwits for the more day to day stuff if you’re interested in keeping up with it! 

If you look at the Pfizer deal of 4.5b for half (I know it’s not even half but for simplicity sake) and say that would value the company at 9b.
Since there’s a 9b valuation from an industry expert and 90m shares outstanding:

that’s $100 a share valuation from Pfizer

Evercore ISI has done excellent coverage and has the most bullish PT on the street of $55.

Timeline? I’m not sure when they make 55 or 100. But I know that they have all the right people, products, and resources in place to be in that ballpark. I trust that Pfizer didn’t wildly overpay considering they are possibly the best in the industry at this."

2021-05-15 10:01:54,wallstreetbets,"There shouldn't be any FUD, imho I think it has gotten strong with liquidity. The $100 mil of secured debt back in Jan with Mudrick Capital was use to boost the liquidity in addition to the $2 mil they already have in equity."
2021-05-15 09:19:18,wallstreetbets,Do you do mutual funds?
2021-05-15 02:34:08,wallstreetbets,Going to the cinemas is one of the biggest American pass times. Sitting at home and seeing a movie will never be a comparable experience. Theaters are the one thing I’m looking forward to most after being shut in for so long.

2021-05-14 21:59:49,wallstreetbets,"You buy premarket like I did around $19, watch it go to $25 in 1 hour, then Robinhood stops people from trading AMC.  So screwed.  Averaged down to $13.65 so hovering between red and green sometimes."
2021-05-14 23:50:27,wallstreetbets,Ha! Got 1k at 16.20 here. This crayon is delicious
2021-05-14 20:28:54,wallstreetbets,this is what im saying
2021-05-14 20:11:25,wallstreetbets,I've averaged UP to 9.49 with AMC. You guys are truly retarded. Bravo!
2021-05-15 09:30:19,wallstreetbets,I say that about banks all the time.
2021-05-15 09:43:13,wallstreetbets,"In this situation so does B Riley.  They've had AMC pegged for this growth all year and for good reason.  When you look at the competitive landscape AMC is poised to eat up a lot of market share by getting their ass kicked slightly less hard during the pandemic.  B Riley does not believe AMC will need to raise further capital in 2022 or 2023 while competitors are closing locations or going out of business.  AMC will be able to pick and choose which locations they want to get at a discount.

B Riley isn't some dumbass analyst with a shitty track record.  They are a top notch wealth management fund that has performed exceptionally well through market downturns.  When there is uncertainly I keep a closer eye on what they are recommending.

2021-05-15 04:31:04,wallstreetbets,I will buy on Monday!
2021-05-15 00:24:38,wallstreetbets,none of that matters in terms of a short squeeze. you havnt done the research. why have all the big banks and hedgefunds gone all in on AMC? you think there isnt going to be a market for a night out at the movies? AMC is the only movie chain to survive the pandemic and they will be the only option left if there are ANY. they will survive the next couple years minimum. Again this has NOTHING to do with the short interest piled against them which WILL squeeze.

2021-05-14 20:50:50,wallstreetbets,Why do you guys say such cringe shit all the time?
2021-05-15 09:32:32,wallstreetbets,"If you look at the competitive landscape AMC is primed to take over a lot of market share.  B Riley doesn't think they will need to raise more capital in 2022 or 2023 as the industry recovers, which is a very big deal.  They can improve their balance sheet without taking on further risk.  Competitors are closing locations and/or going out of business and will need to take on debt to survive.  AMC is 2 steps ahead of them.  

Furthermore the IV is still thiqque af and the money that can be made on selling options for something that mostly trades sideways and spikes up is ridiculous.  I like the stock and am looking for a new place to re-enter after some shares were called away this week."
2021-05-14 23:52:22,wallstreetbets,Yeah if each share is $10k AMC will have a market cap of (checks notes..) 4.5 trillion dollars that seems totally reasonable.
2021-05-14 21:44:52,wallstreetbets,"Actually if you did your DD you would know that they diluted the stock ages ago, that's old news."
2021-05-15 01:42:05,wallstreetbets,"No problem. No, this will most certainly go towards bills and debt. They have $6 billion in debt at the moment and annualized earnings per share are -$19. They really do need the money. Their business will most likely survive but they may have to undergo some kind if restructuring or authorize more shares which would be bad for shareholders. However it would be even worse for shareholders were they to go under. I really do hope the best for them but they are in a bad situation, not only because of covid but because theaters in general have been on a decline for the last 20 years with the development of better home tvs, less time between theatric release and home consumption (used to be you had to wait a year if you missed it in the theaters, now it's simultanuous releases). Movie theaters will almost certainly survive but there might be much fewer of them in them in the future."
2021-05-14 20:32:10,wallstreetbets,"Where'd you get that number from? It was like $7 at the start of 2020, and has been diluted 1:5 since then which makes its pre-covid value roughly $1.50

How'd you end up at $14?"
2021-05-15 00:24:45,wallstreetbets,wrong.

2021-05-14 20:15:49,wallstreetbets,Hopefully. Itll be a giant fuckening for all. Boom goes the binary under the floorboards.
2021-05-15 02:14:19,wallstreetbets,The new wsb crowd is just amc and gme bagholders. Absolutely sick and tired of hearing about these two cunting worthless companies.
2021-05-14 21:51:34,wallstreetbets,Amen. So many people don't even know the basics of trading or even what an investors relations page is and they get mad that their investments go downhill. You're on a sub called wallstreet BETS. you're gambling money away guys lmao
2021-05-14 22:39:31,wallstreetbets,Werth.
2021-05-15 02:07:19,wallstreetbets,The butter popcorn is definitely not included in the $14 price. Unless you mean they both cost $14 cause they might lol.
2021-05-14 22:30:27,wallstreetbets,Like a year ago... is it possible that different theaters have different quality standards?

2021-05-15 01:27:29,wallstreetbets,"There is a bar in the one by my house. Went once and ordered a pint of beer and an Absolut on the rocks (literally gave me 1oz of vodka with a jigger).. with a modest tip, it was $40.. no thank you!! Could have bought 2 shares of AMC at $20 each and felt better about the purchase!"
2021-05-14 20:15:02,wallstreetbets,You are a cunt but god bless you for calling a stranger a spastic.
2021-05-15 09:22:34,wallstreetbets,You're ignoring that most of their competition is failing.  You can raise 10 trillion dollars and if you put it all towards debt you're limiting your short term growth.  No person or business should ever put all of their capital towards debt....
2021-05-15 00:31:17,wallstreetbets,"After the squeeze i assume it will crash. still a while before that, and they may bounce back as a business in years to come. who knows! the squeeze is coming !"
2021-05-14 22:56:39,wallstreetbets,I'm not invested in AMC so i haven't done DD on it. I'll take your word for it that they diluted months ago. I'm still curious how that's good news for shareholders.
2021-05-14 20:52:12,wallstreetbets,"You forget, these retards don’t understand things like dilution."

2021-05-15 07:03:45,wallstreetbets,"See, AMC could fix this problem simply with vending machines, and while that reduces labor, it focuses 
more labor toward maintaining the theatre and improving the overall experience."
2021-05-15 13:46:42,wallstreetbets,Yea but that’s not nearly as good of a story
2021-05-15 06:48:23,wallstreetbets,"That is a literal lie.

You are parroting a LIE. Shorts do NOT have to cover. They will just keep holding their shorts and shorting more and more, much how you are holding your longs and buying more and more.

The difference is, the company is destined for bankruptcy."

2021-05-14 23:32:40,wallstreetbets,AMC was red for about a week while they sold these off. Now they're done and the stock is running. This is good news and is not dilution as people are saying it is. They've already diluted. They have 2 billion in equity at this point.

There's nothing to be done about it for right now. Granted, this isn't much different from '*suckz bro okay let's move on*', but I'm thinking about your mental state here.

If there is going to be a comeuppance or revenge, it's going to happen way down the line. If you'll feel better about it, short their IPO or something. In any case, revenge is a dish best served cold. If there was fraud, there will surely be some sort of consequence. You don't have to get over it entirely, but neither can you remain actively bothered by it."

2021-05-15 18:00:41,wallstreetbets,"Some people are talking like this is a no-brainer, but AMC wasn’t doing great pre-COVID either because people stream a lot and AMC needs a lot of people using their theaters. You need huge numbers, not just the narrative."

2021-05-15 08:38:53,wallstreetbets,"I think my original post pretty much summed it up, and others seem to agree. Talking shit about a company has never been a positions or ban thing, and shorting a company as retail almost never happens here so expecting people to have to do it in order to comment is braindead.

2021-05-15 02:11:37,wallstreetbets,I hate green and love red.  Green means I should sell it but red means I should be buying more.  That's usually when I go sell some green so I can go buy more of the deepest red.
2021-05-15 02:15:38,wallstreetbets,"I can think of maybe 3 picks I got from social media that didn’t burn me. Ever. I thought, the more sources the better but if you got shit sources that’s what you’ll be surrounded by.

  Started just drafting random ass dudes and won more often.  

All my heavily researched stocks are redder than a ginger kid eating ghost peppers, meanwhile some random bullshit I grabbed doubled in a day.   Throwing darts man, throw enough of them u gotta hit 🎯 eventually.

2021-05-15 07:21:15,wallstreetbets,"Cramer is a guy who recommends stocks at their 52 week highs! He hated, as an example, ATT at 28, but recommended it the other day at 32 for its huge and safe dividend.

The guy is entertaining but if he can make it in the business, anyone can. When he says buy, I sell or buy puts. When he doesn’t like a stock, I do some research if the name peaks my interest and then buy!"

2021-05-14 21:42:14,wallstreetbets,"I don't necessarily hold this against Cramer. Cramer, like all of the hosts and guest managers, are no different than sports announcers. They have NO idea what is going to happen next, but people pay them money to know, so they just come up with explanations that fit the current narrative in a manner that makes it appear they knew all along."

These idiots are trying to sound like experts, but the fact that they can't even afford decent audio set up should tell you they aren't making money on stocks."
2021-05-14 20:03:01,wallstreetbets,I watch Cramer for pretty much the same reasons you mentioned. The opening and the CEO interviews. He's not the greatest stock picker but I did buy (GOOG) when it was selling in the $300 neighborhood and he was begging people to buy it every day. Honestly I miss watching Wall Street Week. There were stock pickers on that show that made me multiples.
2021-05-15 10:49:16,wallstreetbets,"I think this is a very good rundown on him and his show. Nobody is correct on stock picks 100% of the time. Even Peter Lynch calls this out. 

This show is for educational purposes. I fully agree with the part about the first segment of the show. During the sell off this week yeah I knew it was inflation concerns, but him explaining the bonds and commodities and all the indicators people looked at was priceless. I probably wouldn’t have figured out all those relationships on my own.

He’s a resource. He has knowledge in the industry and knows how they think. I listen to get ideas for my own research and see what market sentiment is. 

I’ve made decent money on ideas I got from his show after doing my own research, just like I have with ideas from here. I’ve also lost on ideas from both. 

I believe the downfall of a lot of investors here is this idea of for or against and not being open to other perspectives. Stocks don’t give a damn about principles, just facts. And facts are that people like Cramer run the market, so to just write off everything they say as boomer nonsense is pretty silly."

The stock price is determined by what investors are willing to pay for it / Think it's worth (in the future) not what the company is actually worth. 

It wont help met sleep to invest in a company with good fundamentals when the sentiment can chance with 1 tweet. And, almost all long term investors are saying that they were surprised by fraud or a scandel in a company they knew 99% of.  So diversify. 

Also, shit like a pandamic, a financial crisis etc. It happens way to often and it doesn't care about fundamentals. So in order for me to keep relaxed about my investments.. I dont put too much faith in fundamentals. 

Let me be clear. I do believe in fundamentals, you should know if a company has debt etc, the basics. But you can just read that. I wouldn't call it analysis."

2021-05-15 10:41:37,wallstreetbets,"Something's changed, the stock's movements are a lot more coupled with AMC as of late.  There were a couple months where they diverged, particularly after that second pop up to $340ish.  And now that's back, and it feels like that sensation in the air when you know it's going to rain.  It's a hot day, but then a thin wisp of an ever so faintly cooler breeze touches your skin and you know what's coming.  They're where we are.

If one gets set off then I expect the other to go nuts too.  Not BB, not KOSS, not NOK, just AMC.  GME and AMC are companies that resonate with this retail crowd.  If these were companies that make self-sealing stem bolts nobody would give this a second thought, but both of them are companies that these people have very positive attachments to, and watching Toys R Us fail is warning enough to make this real."

2021-05-14 20:40:51,wallstreetbets,"Even if theoretically it could go as high as the hundred thousands or millions values per share how would the government allow it to happen? Wouldn't they just throw the switch and shut down the stock market like federally as soon as it hit over a certain limit too soon or too quickly even if we were owed the money? Like I'm with all you guys they owe us $800 billion dollars but the fact that that would crash the stock market wouldn't that make the government step in as if it were a national security crisis and pull the plug on the entire stock market in that scenario?
This is something I've been pondering as I read the many memes and posts stating that 10 million is the floor now because I read the numbers and the DD and TA make sense as far as my retarded ass can surmise I just don't see a reality where the Federal reserve lets us get away with it even if we own it"

Silicon Valley is unique. Some of the top schools in the US are there, especially for tech. This brings top researchers and innovation. Silicon Valley also has SF which is one of the two financial hubs in the US (NY and SF are the two).   
There is a reason Telsa, a car company, is building cars in the most expensive place to build cars in the world (the bay area). It's because Tesla is first and foremost a tech company focused on innovation. Don't confuse a software company based in another state for a tech company. They are fundamentally different. And look, I'm not saying that one day we won't start getting tech companies outside silicon valley, or that there exist none outside silicon valley (there are), its just that its more rare and difficult."

2021-05-15 13:00:39,wallstreetbets,"Actually own an EV dude. 

What I don't like about Fisker as an investment is they have to keep handing out a chunk of their company to sign suppliers. 
Also there's never going to be no identity to this company because they don't do the vehicle engineering. It's all farmed out.

They are going to launch with decent quality on the ocean because they don't have the growing pains on manufacturing. Foxconn doesn't build cars so I'm curious too see how they accomplish this."
2021-05-14 21:34:32,wallstreetbets,"Fisker might have a car in production a couple years from now. To little to late. Tesla and others will have an affordable ev out before than for probably less than $30,000."

2021-05-15 08:11:04,wallstreetbets,"Palantir is a hype scam company? Lol I’m fully aware of their product and how it works. I am fully aware that they have the best of the best and that they make custom packages for pretty much everyone. I dont think they have a magical ai software that they can just have someone hit download and wallah perfect ai software designed for your company. So you can calm down with your condescension. Nothing you said is new or groundbreaking. And your weWork example is a massive reach with almost no comparison to palantir. Did WeWork have 17 years of experience before ipo? Did WeWork have a massive moat created with their government contracts including one to protect the U.S. nuke supply(pretty important)? No
 
Also you say they have high cost but their adjusted gross margin is 80%. When it comes to scalability I think anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of the company know this is a concern. That being said crated industry specific software like skywise could be a good way to get that scalability and high customization. It already looks like it’s taking over the airline industry.

But you have a clear opinion on this company and I suggest you buy some $15 puts 2023 when the market opens and show me the screenshots here. Since your so confident of them being a hype scam company"

The reason for all that data wrangling is different source systems don't produce data in a consistent, interoperable way. As you rightly mention, today you have to publish raw events into an object store or warehouse, clean/prep them, *then* do your analysis or modeling, *then* make individual optimizations to each source system that originally produced the data. 

With Palantir, your entire data landscape from source to analytics is in the same data model and you can *instantly* make changes to source systems based on what Palantir is seeing *in real time.*"

2021-05-15 15:00:53,wallstreetbets,"Proved? I just looked at the screenshot and it said 2.75% and so did you in the first post with saying -15k down, so you're basically proving you made a mistake first and it's somehow on me? I also don't know what the amount has to do with anything.

2021-05-15 03:37:58,wallstreetbets,"There's too many factors stacked up now to allow TSLA to stay high.

- rising metal prices
- trouble in china
- the realisation that self-driving is a pipe dream (they're back pedaling hard)
- the number of battery tech companies emerging (eg: northvolt) challenging the naive idea that tesla could make it big manufacturing batteries (they can't, they still rely on other suppliers and they have no competitive advantage in it)
- NIO and traditional car manufacturers getting really good at EVs
- the mass recalls
- the global chip shortage
- Tesla as a brand is fucked, people have gotten tired of their poor quality control. Too many people have bought teslas and become unhappy with service.

Finally, Elon isn't cool anymore. His army of weird nerds are growing up and smelling the bullshit. He's gone mainstream, normiesare fickle, they'll find a new celebrity to gush over and forget muskie exists.

Don't forget that tesla isn't even Musks main project. He cares far more about SpaceX. If he has to abandon tesla, it won't destroy him. The bigger and more important SpaceX becomes, the less he'll care about Tesla."

Edit, go to the section with US cannabis dispencorie count. All of those companies are pure play MSO's. Canadian companies don't have any dispencories in the state's yet.

Edit#3. In my opinion, the most likely to get acquired would be vireo, 4front, harbourside, and medicine man.

Edit#4. If your looking to play the broader market, or play with options, MSOS ETF is the only ETF that I know of that focuses on us MSO's. They figured out a loop hole to allow them to list on a major exchange. It has something to do with share swaps and darivatives being used as Thier holdings."

Sell weekly covered calls at your cost basis or near it, let them expire, repeat every week. Depending on how long this takes to recover, will take you some time, but still, you will recover some money every week. Maybe 50-100 dls per week will not feel as a lot, but if you deposit 50-100 dls per week, you will feel as a lot of money"

2021-05-15 19:58:26,wallstreetbets,"There is a limit. GameStop did the same thing and you can look at how that happened for an example. For the record, it is always counterproductive for the company to have a low share price. Always. They'd have to make a deal with hundreds of HFs all of which will only start shorting them again if they think the business will fail."

2021-05-15 14:01:11,wallstreetbets,"This is probably a naiive question but why does the government even care about curbing inflation? It helps wealthy property owners and it helps offset government debt. It seems that the main people getting fucked by inflation are renters and low income people.

It seems to me like they know all this stimulus will cause inflation. They know they needed to provide direct stimulus to appease the masses during COVID, but in the long term it's still going to make the rich get richer and the poor get poorer."
2021-05-15 15:13:53,wallstreetbets,"It's the same reason why gov pretend that they are helping people. Fed claim that they have two roles: reduce unemployment and inflation. In reality their only job is to push up stock market and if the worst happens, bail out all the major institutions and restart this farce."
2021-05-15 12:35:07,wallstreetbets,It's highly dependent of their portfolio and their finance structure. Long term borrowings e.g. would be a big pro. In addition they have to be able to raise rents and leases.

2021-05-14 23:47:25,wallstreetbets,"Jnug is extremely risky because volatility crushes leveraged funds, and the juniors are full of speculation and dogshit.

2021-05-14 20:39:52,wallstreetbets,"I saw Cramer preaching some Memorial Day play involving TSLA. Saying investing before Memorial Day, has given results afterward. I wound up buying more puts expiring 5/28. $570 and $585. I'm getting killed and I held on. How bearish are you overall? Are you always? For me to buy a long put until Dec, it would cost me most of my money. What did you mean by past a generational peak? Baby boomer retirement age? You can PM if you want."
2021-05-15 03:29:22,wallstreetbets,"What I mean is we're not going to see hyped up stocks like tesla reaching these highs for another 20-30 years.

S&P500 will see a big decline or a levelling off at least.

I've been bearish on tesla for about a year, but it's been hard to short in the past. Tbh if you can't afford long term puts, I'd get out of options trading, it's too risky for you. My short positions cost me about 10% of my total portfolio, it's high-risk high-reward.

I'm only shorting tesla right now because it's an exceptionally overvalued company. It's unheard of for a company on the s&p500 to be this overvalued, it's not normal.

The risk of shorting tesla is that nobody knows for sure when it will crash out, we just know it will. It could slide gradually for years, or it could flash crash next week, but the correction is overdue.

At your strike prices maybe monthly puts could work, but be prepared to lose everything, as Burry said ""It's hard to short a cult"""

That’s how you do it. You make smart moves. I went heavy into Finance and it paid off. I bought WBS @ $28 it’s at $56.31 now. I bought CRWD @ $101 it’s at $190.64 now down from $218. I bought FB @ $187 it’s at $317 now.  Do your DD, read up on trends, talk to people in different industries, etc. It’s work. Don’t expect luck."

2021-05-15 16:39:30,wallstreetbets,"“This is unbelievably, laughably untrue. California's state debt stands at about $777 billion, the highest in the country, dwarfing runner-up New York ($387 billion). According to State Budget Solutions, Sacramento has racked up close to $130 billion in outstanding debt, and it faces nearly $650 billion in unfunded liabilities for public employee pensions and other retirement benefits” just a quick excerpt for you. Can’t communicate with people that won’t even do there own research so you can just read at least?"

2021-05-14 23:04:45,wallstreetbets,Can someone give me a link to a video explaining more about this? I’m new to all this financial responsibility business.
2021-05-15 18:04:38,wallstreetbets,"**Help Me Understand**  
Could someone here help me understand why $PSLV doesn't match up to the price of silver? What I mean by that, is I understand that PSLV buys physical silver, but I thought these type of ETFs were supposed to match up on a one to one comparison for the silver price. I understand that $SLV is lying to the public about the silver they actually have in physical silver themselves, but their price matches close to the price of silver on the COMEX.  


Additionally, if the price of silver goes up by one (1) dollar on COMEX, what is likely to happen to the price of both $PSLV and $SLV in actual dollar value? As of right now (May 15, 2021) PSLV = 9.78 and SLV = 25.46  


COMEX = Silver COMEX (Jul′21) 27.525 as of May 15, 2021"
2021-05-14 22:21:11,wallstreetbets,People were also jumping into SLV which is the worst place to put your Silver money.
2021-05-14 22:25:02,wallstreetbets,GDXJ has some silver miners in it.  Then you have SIL (large cap) and SILJ (Small cap)
2021-05-15 17:57:54,wallstreetbets,And everything you want
2021-05-14 22:28:01,wallstreetbets,"Look up SILJ, leveraged play on the price of silver.  Silver was up 1.75% today and SILJ 4.25%.  And unlike options, no timing needed.  Options will make you more if you get the timing right but that is difficult"
2021-05-15 18:04:38,wallstreetbets,Was in at 7.00 for 400 and 3 7C’s and iron fisted them until today. I’m convinced we’ll see ath’s in 2022
2021-05-15 19:52:13,wallstreetbets,"I am holding remaining 400 for moon tendies one day.  I never expected it to hit those 20s as quick as it did and really am a dummy for not taking the easy money.   It does seem that they have enough going on to warrant good upside in the next 12-24mo but execution is everything.  Hope you are right, making a few grand will be a pleasant surprise."
2021-05-14 21:23:58,wallstreetbets,don't say it
2021-05-14 21:08:13,wallstreetbets,I love it when they short us.  The more they try and figure out how to unfuck themselves the more i laugh and push the green buy button on my phone.

2021-05-15 01:50:24,wallstreetbets,"The issue is more so the GoM and the lack of progress due to covid19 surge and also the presidential elections.  They will start up talks again after June 8.
There is a little uncertainty if the undercut gets pushed back. Also there was an article that cost May spike a ridiculously large number due to covid19 but I think it was exaggerating and would be marginal as the impact of covid19 should only be in Q2.

The government trash talking of the mine is at a whole another level due to the presidential election. At this point the government issue of them trying to steal more of the pie may linger on into Q3/Q4.  It is expected that the undercut will be separate from the negotiations so there shouldn’t be a delay.

The stock is climbing a wall of worry and there are bound to be pullbacks until most everything is resolved.  In the end the stock can possibly make you wait all the way to fruition (2024 and onwards) as the stock price can’t be manipulated when there are large dividend payouts."

2021-05-15 08:17:32,wallstreetbets,"> Literally all this needs is Volume

Lol that's like saying all a stock needs to go up in price are buyers. You won't find it you won't get it. Shit is getting crushed after earnings and will die just like any other meme stock.

And it's not just 2% covered. The absolute percentage change doesn't tell you anything. Looking at the price change amid low volume during the first spike tells you that majority shorts have been covered and a whole bunch of new shorts were opened.

Like how many times do WSB retards have to tell themselves ""the squeeze is coming"" yet nothing happens, before they realize they're fucking retards? It is literally just a bunch of new investors who learned a new concept but have a serious misunderstanding of how market works trying to write these ""DD's"". Let's face it, you didn't even know about gamma until a month ago or something, and now you're convinced everything is shorts and gamma squeezes."
2021-05-15 02:43:44,wallstreetbets,Great post man. Had the same thought process back in July when I myself discovered all of this. I bought quite a bit of defense stock. Very curious to see how the market reacts with the months ahead.

2021-05-15 11:07:11,wallstreetbets,"Nucor is absolutely not Chinese steel. All of Nucor’s steel mills are in the US and with 99.99% of facilities being in North America. ALL Nucor made steel is actually from recycled scrap metal. I don’t know where all of the scrap comes from, but I’m sure all if not the vast majority of it is from North America. A segment of Nucor is DJJ which actually owns a large number of scrap yards across North America that the Nucor mills also receive scrap metal from. Furthermore, all Nucor steel mills are mini-mills which use electric-arc furnaces(EAFs) to melt the scrap steel instead of traditional methods such as coal. Nucor also has the reputation in the industry of producing some of the highest quality steel. So in conclusion, Nucor is actually a very sustainable producer in the world of steel manufacturing and is often the go-to choice for true, quality, US-made steel products."
2021-05-15 07:29:43,wallstreetbets,"You are welcome. Actually I was thinking that is pretty noticeable that on wallstreetbets so many people are discussing RNG 

$TSLA Tesla’s narrative has been terrific, and without Elon Musk probably not so many automotive manufacturers would have pushed for light vehicles EV. For heavy duty though, the situation is more complex, and the compelling narrative of RNG should be taught to the market. 

Many brokers will come in the next months as $CNHI, $CMI, $GTLS are all talking of Natural Gas Vehicles in their quarter CC...and when large brokers come, stock prices definitely go up"

2021-05-15 13:12:10,wallstreetbets,"I had PLUG and FCEL and did well, glad I sold when it started to dip as it hasn’t recovered. After the squeeze, I’d buy GME when it was below $150 and sell at $175, that paid well a few times but I think the end is near."
2021-05-15 13:16:57,wallstreetbets,"The end for GME or for other stocks ?

Yes I invested in hydrogen back in 2017, amazing trend although not much backed by fundamentals on the fuel cells side of the business 

I was thinking that biomethane and rng can be next big thing for the energy sector in 2021 as no major brokers covers them (except for clne as i said in this post and elsewhere). The only thing we would need to do is to “teach” the investment community (wsb) that for heavy duty bev should be forget and RNG is the real revolution"
2021-05-15 13:34:55,wallstreetbets,"I think GME has ran it’s course and the powers that be aren’t going to “let” it squeeze again, ever. Just an opinion but the players who lost were totally taken by surprise and there’s no way they’re going to let it happen again. If the environmentalist crowd ever realizes that renewable energy is the best option for the planet, there’s my early retirement"
2021-05-15 13:36:52,wallstreetbets,Yes indeed it will not happen again.. but with good rng dd we could start a new trend from this.. rng is much better for the environment than anything else renewable

I don’t know what’s going to make a difference. Price action will tell it all. Unless Cohen has a dramatic ace up his sleeve GME will likely hit max pain every week. He unfollowed Musk so no more Tesla partnership theory. Shelf offering states he thinks $180 is the ceiling. There are plenty of better trades to make."
