2021-06-15 19:54:26,stocks,SOFI is going to be disruptive to the big banks
2021-06-15 19:49:58,stocks,An ETF might be what you’re looking for. TQQQ grows consistently and strongly.
2021-06-15 19:53:56,stocks,"I’ve thought about an ETF, but I find it more fun picking stocks (yes I know most people won’t agree with this). But I’ve looked at WM, Honeywell, LLY maybe JNJ or Costco too. Can’t really decide on one"
2021-06-15 19:57:44,stocks,"JPM is down right now and churns out gains quite consistently, good time to buy."
2021-06-15 19:19:50,stocks,"Lol this is just silly. You are a shareholder, if a company is making money, the company is worth more money, as a shareholder you benefit from higher valuation of the company. A stock price represents the “future” expected earnings growth of the company. That’s why it’s important to value a company properly today so you don’t over pay."
2021-06-15 19:18:20,stocks,"Because a company can print unlimited amount of shares and dump on you. With  companies with good profitability, the opposite happens (stock buy backs make shares more scarce)."
2021-06-15 19:27:44,stocks,A company like Amazon doesn’t pay a dividend because all of its profits go back into the company for expansion (growth) or a company like coke cola pays a dividend because like what else could it grow into? So it pays some of that profit back to its share holders
2021-06-15 19:32:11,stocks,You can sell covered calls to earn income
2021-06-15 19:56:21,stocks,You can sell calls on long shares to generate income.
2021-06-15 19:24:24,stocks,Popularity contest.
2021-06-15 19:17:28,stocks,Looking at the valuations of some of these companies out here you may be right.
2021-06-15 19:23:48,stocks,"Ok this makes sense - companies can buy back stock, driving up the price, if they are performing well.  What’s the company’s incentive to start buying back its own shares?"
2021-06-15 19:25:31,stocks,It’s investing in itself at that point. A Great companies would never dump shares on you or themselves.
2021-06-15 19:32:39,stocks,"The incentive is creating a more attractive environment for investors to attract even more investors. In a literal sense, a stock is a fundraising mechanism for a company that works by giving stock buyers a legal % ownership of a company as collateral. The goal is to take investors money and use it to grow the company and make more money."
2021-06-15 19:35:30,stocks,Only like penny stocks pump and dump shares like this. I know how it works lol delude the shares then hit you with a reverse split till you have nothing. Like I said no good company would do this. Only companies on the OTC/pink sheet does this.
2021-06-15 19:39:50,stocks,">Like I said no good company would do this

What do you think Tesla did? They took advantage of the WSB hype and sold billions worth of stock at the top. They even took those funds and rode the Bitcoin hype too. It's not just penny stocks, when something gets way above it's fundamental value eventually the CEOs will print more shares and dump on you."
2021-06-15 19:43:19,stocks,"Ok? That’s good for them they raised an enormous amount of money doing it. They didn’t pump shares into the market, they did a stock split which greatly benefitted current shareholders without deluding"
2021-06-15 19:45:17,stocks,"[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/tesla-to-raise-up-to-5-billion-in-share-offering.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/tesla-to-raise-up-to-5-billion-in-share-offering.html)

&#x200B;

They did tho"
2021-06-15 19:53:31,stocks,This is 1 company and a lot of people don’t consider it a good one. The Delusion is less than 1% from that post and they gave fair warning way ahead of time. Looks like it’s for the company growth and not a wild goose chase
2021-06-15 19:55:17,stocks,the words you're looking for are dilute and dilution.  Delude and delusion have an entirely different meaning
2021-06-15 19:56:21,stocks,Plz explain
2021-06-15 19:00:19,stocks,The taxes will make this not worth it. Just pay it off
2021-06-15 19:10:56,stocks,"If you have the $8000 already, just pay it off and invest what would’ve been the monthly payment over the next several years until you’re ready to buy a new car. Short term gains tax, market downturn, not being able to maintain steady gains can all turn this into a “robbing Peter to pay Paul” situation."
2021-06-15 19:02:39,stocks,"just pay 8k off the car, pulling from it you'll experience drawdowns daily/weekly and monthly you won't be able to pull from it especially from an etf like QQQ."
2021-06-15 18:58:40,stocks,great plan until the market drops 40% and stays down for a few years.
2021-06-15 18:39:57,stocks,"Work is going on this front and OECD and G7 are working on this under Pillar One BEPS. However this required a lot of treaty amendments, agreement from all parties about the scope of taxation etc. 

Unilateral taxes might lead to another sanction war. So it’s not an ideal situation. Let’s see what happens. But the big tech co have truly been under scanner for their operating legal structures and tax shielding arrangements."
2021-06-15 18:40:06,stocks,"We certainly need a fix for what has been a very long standing problem.  Global is a good approach, so it applies to everyone and there’s nowhere to hide."
2021-06-15 19:18:18,stocks,"My guess is they would ease into so as to not cause too much disruption. Usually when they spring something on corps for the first time they understand they cant take the full load at once. 

So yes it will affect them but not as drastically as the overreaction to it will be, because it's a slow bleed tax that will probably ramp up over 10 to 15 years. The governments dont want to bankrupt companies, they cant collect taxes from entities that dont exist. So they're going to keep it within profitable margins and timelines to let the companies adjust."
2021-06-15 18:32:23,stocks,"Yes, no, maybe."
2021-06-15 17:33:10,stocks,"Also IIPR , innovative industrial properties for grow houses and dispensaries with the growing legal cannabis market in the US."
2021-06-15 17:32:53,stocks,What has book value done?
2021-06-15 18:03:53,stocks,Bullish on LADR. Finally deploying real capital again. I say 50% upside by this time next year.
2021-06-15 17:40:30,stocks,REITs are the secret money play this summer. O STOR WPC and others all majorly up.
2021-06-15 18:57:32,stocks,STAG pays monthly dividends
2021-06-15 19:18:58,stocks,"My REITs, including STWD, are stars of my Roth."
2021-06-15 18:56:41,stocks,I'm up 48.6% on REI.UN and 44.7% on SOT.UN :)
2021-06-15 19:49:34,stocks,"I loaded up on FRT last year during the dip. Up almost 100% since then. I’ve always been a fan of their properties and investment strategy. It’s a longterm hold for me. 

REITs are definitely overlooked on this sub and on Reddit in general. I’ll check out SRET"
2021-06-15 18:26:55,stocks,"I actually had maybe 10% of my portfolio in SRET when it cratered back in March 2020 and wound up buying tons and tons of shares in April or May because I really couldn't see any reason why it would go from like 15 to 5.  I've since sold it all but yeah, pretty cool ETF to hold.  Monthly dividend and cheap price per share makes DRIP pretty entertaining.  Absolutely no liquidity on options but reasonably OTM calls for .05 is pretty cool too."
2021-06-15 19:04:41,stocks,I got TWO O ABR AGNC and my two favs that are B2C TCPC and HTGC have all done well after losing 70~% last year only wish I woulda added more then didn’t know if it was going to crash further so I was a bit too cautious
2021-06-15 17:50:42,stocks,I've been bullish AF on REITs but no one is listening. It's too boring apparently
2021-06-15 18:51:33,stocks,O is my best performer in my portfolio currently. They go back and forth with ruger for first sometimes but got to sayI am very happy with its performance. I'll have to research the others listed
2021-06-15 19:11:21,stocks,You better hurry up before kenny gets em first
2021-06-15 17:34:20,stocks,"ABR. Similar numbers. The naked shorts are depressing it slightly.,.."
2021-06-15 18:32:30,stocks,"There are some fabulous microcaps & small caps in REITs. There's one that I got back into that has has been doing great in 2021 (it has risen 5% in the past week alone) and is still projected to gain about 50%. It has about 9% yield, too. I took profits on it a couple of weeks ago and didn't realize it still had a whole other leg up at the time. So I got back into it this week.

Unfortunately, I can't really post symbols or names because the microcaps are really vulnerable to volatility if I post them here. But I highly recommend using stock screeners to find growing small cap & microcap REITs right now."
2021-06-15 18:05:26,stocks,Ooohhh…. Sign me up!  This is why I posted though.  Whats their dividend?
2021-06-15 19:56:18,stocks,"I have a ton of LADR and TRTX, and I just sold my IVR. Can’t win them all. Still loading LADR."
2021-06-15 17:44:46,stocks,After they got cut in half about a year ago pretty much my entire family all moved money into REITs.  Was a brilliant move.
2021-06-15 19:33:21,stocks,"I’m still heavily in and just holding STWD.  It’s a nice dividend stock.  But, I can’t recommend it as a buy as its at all time highs now.

Edit: me too on our Roths!  Bravo to you."
2021-06-15 18:38:28,stocks,"I don’t play options.  I do a little day trading and follow the memes for entertainment $1000 at a time.  

This is simply one of the stocks that make guaranteed income.  And there is still a good upside (both underpriced and undervalued)."
2021-06-15 19:02:32,stocks,"Good, more chances to buy at a discount"
2021-06-15 17:55:36,stocks,"I’ve been curious about that.  Was downvoted months ago after like 25%+ returns and just trying to say to check the charts.

I just shrug and buy more while scratching my head wondering what I’m missing?  I have much to learn still."
2021-06-15 17:39:12,stocks,Thank you.  I’ll check it.  I’m constantly trying to find where to put cash when the market is bloated (as I believe it to be).
2021-06-15 18:14:04,stocks,6.6%. Has been and will be a bumpy ride to full recovery.  Was trading at 18.50 pre pandemic.  Plan to go from 300m to over 800m deployed capital by Q4.  Strap in.
2021-06-15 18:43:47,stocks,"Shhhhhhhhhh! It’s been my biggest winner since GameStop lol

Eventually I’ll just get to the point where I own my own rentals. Squeeze those College kids and abuse their meekness."
2021-06-15 17:56:25,stocks,People don't want to hear about your boring winners z they want excitement and volatility like meme stocks
2021-06-15 18:32:31,stocks,$COUR. Top online education platform.
2021-06-15 18:42:00,stocks,Pardon my ignorance. The 6.6% dividend is paid out as 6.6% or whatever the share price is the day dividend is paid right?  I have some dividend stocks where it’s just the same $ value paid per share so the percentage each holder gets changes based on their avg cost
2021-06-15 19:56:25,stocks,"Just bought 2 shares. I'm just dabbling with all this still, but it's an interesting learning experience. Stocks in that $10-$15 per share  range is about as comfortable as I get, and I've never bought one with dividends before! So this should be interesting! Thanks!"
2021-06-15 18:19:53,stocks,Just deposited $5k and placed an order.  I shouldn’t post stuff like this when im OP talking about a solid investment.  I like looking at charts and like your recommendation.
2021-06-15 18:45:09,stocks,That is actually interesting given Covid.  I would normally steer clear.
2021-06-15 18:48:18,stocks,6.6 base on recent distribution compared to current share price. Check historical distribution for reference.  https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ladr/dividend-history
2021-06-15 19:04:19,stocks,Essentially an annual % based upon the stock price (divided).  Some pay monthly or quarterly.  So you get small amounts deposited to your account (or re-invested in additional shares.  Your choice).  I personally enjoy the surprises of cash being added to my accounts that I may put elsewhere.
2021-06-15 18:28:52,stocks,"Wow. You don’t waste any time. Like I said could be bumpy, but I’m in for the ride and will add along the way.  I think we’ll be happy we did by summer 2022."
2021-06-15 19:50:23,stocks,"The opposite. It won't replace undergraduate experience. But for post grad work and Google, IBM, Intel, & other certificates, it slays. Duke, Stanford, Cornell, Johns Hopkins, Michigan are all part of it...."
2021-06-15 18:30:49,stocks,I’m sitting on a few hundred thousand in cash…. Hard to find good places to put it.  USHY?  At least you get a dividend this way and a chance for a gain.
2021-06-15 18:46:22,stocks,Yo just buy a rental yourself and cut the fees out
2021-06-15 18:52:07,stocks,"LOL.  Very funny given that I just sold and then paid cash for a home.  The financial freedom of $0 debt/mortgage/bills is kinda insane.

Not sure that I want to be a property manager.  Ive had a lot of roommates and know how they treat things that aren’t theirs.

I’m pretty good at this.  The housing market is about to crash throughout much of America.  I’ll probably buy another property after that happens."
2021-06-15 18:53:58,stocks,Find a nice college town. Buy up a few condos. You can get away with some things when your tenets only stay a year or 2. There’s a whole subculture of people doing it here
2021-06-15 19:32:01,stocks,Subculture of white males scamming college kids? Rather interesting
2021-06-15 17:17:45,stocks,"I don’t have an opinion on your post one way or the other. I do just want to say one thing based on this:

>lack of modern day decency

Right now, even today, might actually be the most peaceful the world as a whole has been in modern history"
2021-06-15 17:13:13,stocks,How about Oshkosh corp?  They have their hands in both construction and defense.  Great long term play
2021-06-15 18:41:40,stocks,"Theres a lot of reasons to like Lockheed that have nothing to do with war or peace. 

A lot of these old defense companies are now turning into launch capable companies. Because that's the future of war."
2021-06-15 18:49:43,stocks,"Hello fellow KTOS investor. One of my largest holdings. The sad reality is that we're walking on a tight rope to prevent the next war, and even without a full scale war, defensive firepower will be paramount. The future of warfare is drones, and no company is better placed to succeed than Kratos."
2021-06-15 17:44:34,stocks,You might want to look into BAE Systems.

2021-06-15 17:30:00,stocks,That’s what I was thinking

2021-06-15 17:07:27,stocks,"Amateurs on here. Just go out to the garage and get in your time machine, go to news paper stand, forward in time not backwards, and get a newspaper. Don't bring the newspaper back with you. You have to read and remember while you are there because everybody knows it changes back to the old date. And be careful about stock splits especially reverse splits those ones will really get you."
2021-06-15 18:41:00,stocks,"Find about a dozen companies spread over half a dozen industries and follow them like a hawk. The more controversial, the better. 

Over time there will be 'events', and those that track the companies will know of upcoming events. Votes, conferences, deadlines, meetings, changes, mergers, etc all can have an impact in share price. Just knowing about these things can make or break a trader.

I suggest starting with earnings announcements. They happen ever quarter, for every company. Go from there."
2021-06-15 17:17:30,stocks,Lol you sound upset. Are you too used to following gurus and not doing your own research for trends? Back to your mums basement you go ill get my time machine from there
2021-06-15 17:24:26,stocks,"Ya it was those damn reverse splits I'm still sore about that.

On a more serious note the news goes out to the whole world instantly. Even monitored by computers and the market's reaction is monitored and traded by computers. You have to be able to react in milliseconds and only get really small margins out of it. Even then there is no guarantee of profit."
2021-06-15 17:58:39,stocks,"Im not interested in reacting to sudden news that causes spikes in stocks like   
 a day trader. Im looking for a general group of helpful resources that can help me get a jist of events which are coming up in future . Like how when the FDA announces a date for when a drug is going to get its PDUFA the stock gradually increases for months until the date and then gets much hotter in the week of the date."
2021-06-15 17:04:46,stocks,"Typically in a bankruptcy, common stock shareholders are left holding the bag and the stock is eventually de-listed. The shares can trade hands for years on the OTCBB market, but they almost never recover.

The reason they don't recover is because they can only make money if the rest of the company's debt obligations are paid off and there's something left for common stock holders. That almost never happens.

If the company manages to turn things around, they are typically restructured and will issue new stock. Old shareholders aren't entitled to any of this stock.

GM is an example of where common stock shareholders were wiped out in 2009 when they filed Chapter 11. The company was renamed to ""Motors Liquidation Company"" who's stock was worth nothing. A ""new company"" named General Motors emerged from the wreckage, went public with the GM ticker symbol in 2010, and is now doing pretty well. But if you tried holding onto pre-2009 GM stock, you'd have $0 now.

If you think WPG will be successful in the long-term, wait until they emerge from bankruptcy and then buy the stock."
2021-06-15 16:51:16,stocks,Idk man... they’ve only ever been in a downward trend.
2021-06-15 16:51:31,stocks,"Too early in the process to know. Sometimes chapter 11 becomes chapter 7 liquidation. I don’t think there is a turn-around team in place yet. There is also a risk that something goes wrong in the bankruptcy proceedings which could drive the investment to $0.00

I bought a few hundred shares since I think it’s worth the risk. I’m selling covered calls to bring my basis down.  There is also a potential upside scalping a few points off the fluctuations. 

Lastly, with so many stocks trading completely detached from fundamentals it’s always possible the WSB folks decide they want to burn their cash on another bankrupt company."
2021-06-15 17:10:53,stocks,Most Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases end by the old shares being cancelled and new shares being issued to the company's lenders in partial payment of their debts.  This wipes out the existing shareholders.  Its unusual for the pre-bankruptcy shareholders to come out with any value.
2021-06-15 17:33:28,stocks,">WSB folks decide they want to burn their cash on another bankrupt company.

And we can see how that turned out, no?"
2021-06-15 19:22:24,stocks,That wasn’t meant as a negative.
2021-06-15 16:48:52,stocks,"Because it is not a fixed dividend, like other companies and also the dividend is paid half in cash and half in shares.

Suro capital is a business development company (BDC), like a Venture capital fund. It invests in private companies when they are small and then exits them when they become public 

It invested in Coursera and Palantir long back when they were small and private and then sold these shares in the market recently. These high capital gains they are now given out as dividend now."
2021-06-15 16:34:06,stocks,Bonnaroooo
2021-06-15 19:29:26,stocks,"Ah, gotcha. Something to look at, but not anything to bank on. Much appreciated amigo."
2021-06-15 17:28:35,stocks,As soon as I heard about their investment in Palantir pre-IPO I loaded up on this around $9. Definitely did not jump as high as I expected it to considering they made a boat load of money once they sold their shares but with the dividend it’s been a solid investment.
2021-06-15 18:17:03,stocks,So with drip would all of dividend be rebought or do they not slow that?
2021-06-15 18:31:58,stocks,"Yes, by default shareholders are given 50% in cash and 50% stock, but shareholders can also ask for 100% stock as per their communication,which is same as drip. 
Also if you have the standard and your Drip is on, 50% of the dividend you receive as cash will also be converted to stock, but by your broker,."
2021-06-15 18:37:19,stocks,Ok thank you. I’ve been looking at this seems too good to be true so I’m just watching it. Lol but thanks for info might get drunk and pull the trigger one day but right now I can’t seem to get my brain past too good to be true. My strat is dividends of a certain amount and I’d hate to have to keep adding to position to keep it where I want it
2021-06-15 18:40:19,stocks,"Sure but also remember that this dividend value may not get repeated next quarter.

This quarter is the windfall from Coursera and Palantir sells which is increasing the payout."
2021-06-15 18:41:35,stocks,That’s actually great info. So maybe wait till next quarter to buy in so it’s more natural. Thank you so much bud
2021-06-15 17:10:07,stocks,I just entered at 183. Seems to have found the bottom. Long hold for me. At these prices I see CDR as a bet into the gaming industry
2021-06-15 17:28:44,stocks,"Yeah, it bounced from the bottom and keeps rising. I think it won't reach the previous heights, it'll likely stop at around 300 PLN until new games/DLCs are announced"
2021-06-15 17:56:46,stocks,I purchased 100 shares at 11.63 a while back. This is a long hold for me.
2021-06-15 18:41:17,stocks,"Bought at an average of 168 PLN past few weeks. Could go lower still, who knows? I have confidence the business will do well over the next 5-10 years."
2021-06-15 18:34:10,stocks,I didn’t play any Witcher games but realize how popular they are. Bought cyber never even installed do to it’s garbage ness. My opinion not advice is take two is a much better pick for sector. There real big into ar r&d and they own 2 of prolly top 15 game franchises of all time rdr and gta. Just my 2 cents
2021-06-15 19:07:40,stocks,What's your position $ttwo?
2021-06-15 19:19:00,stocks,I mean kinda personal but 150@160. I was more commenting that in video game sector there’s company’s who only put out finished games and don’t let there fans rush them. I sold 50 at the 202 run up to recoup investment
2021-06-15 19:24:20,stocks,Yes there are better companies than cdred. My small position is more of a gamble. I will get it $ttwo if it dips a bit more.
2021-06-15 16:05:03,stocks,Isn’t the main issue that without 1M+ accounts you can’t even get in on these for a good price though?
2021-06-15 15:50:11,stocks,I read an article that listed all of these a couple of days ago. I too would like to know how more seasoned investors go about analyzing companies IPOs and what makes it a buy or skip.

2021-06-15 15:23:53,stocks,Buy and HODL?
2021-06-15 17:09:47,stocks,You got it somewhat right.  June 21 is the ex-split date.  But it doesn't split until july...but guess what's going to happen June 22?  The stock is gonna drop by 75% (or whatever) to reflect the new value.
2021-06-15 16:14:14,stocks,I personally don't like HODLing my stocks. I'm more of a buy and hold kinda guy
2021-06-15 15:36:46,stocks,Well yea but what if it's a good deal June 23 and I want to add mote but you don't get any of the split? Then it's not such a good deal...
2021-06-15 19:32:14,stocks,"But the statement they announced says

Trading is expected to begin on a stock split-adjusted basis on July 20.

So doesn't that mean the stock price drops July 20?"
2021-06-15 19:55:22,stocks,"You obviously don't know how splits work, sir."
2021-06-15 16:43:12,stocks,That’s what HODL is😂…HOLD
2021-06-15 15:41:55,stocks,"No one will steal your money. If you pay the pre-split price your shares will split. If you pay the post-split price the shares will not split again. In either case, the value of the split to investors is zero."
2021-06-15 19:21:01,stocks,This sub has a very different culture from ones you are likely used to.
2021-06-15 15:48:15,stocks,"So then this statement doesn't matter? The way I read it was you have to own it by June 21..

If approval is obtained, each NVIDIA stockholder of record at the close of business on June 21, 2021, will receive a dividend of three additional shares of common stock for every share held on the record date, to be distributed after the close of trading on July 19, 2021."
2021-06-15 16:28:35,stocks,It doesn't matter in the sense that the split is equivalent to exchanging four quarters for a dollar. There is nothing to be gained from owning it the day before vs the day after.
2021-06-15 19:31:08,stocks,"I realize that, but here is where I'm confused. It says

""If approval is obtained, each NVIDIA stockholder of record at the close of business on June 21, 2021, will receive a dividend of three additional shares of common stock for every share held on the record date, to be distributed after the close of trading on July 19, 2021."" The way I take that is you have to be a stockholder on June 21. What about June 22? Because then they say this statement:

""Trading is expected to begin on a stock split-adjusted basis on July 20.""

So the way I read that is the price drops 75% on July 20.

So it says you have to be on record as a shareholder June 21, you'll get the extra share July 19, and July 20 it starts trading at 75% the price. My question is what if you're not on record as a shareholder on June 21, like you buy it June 25?  Since it doesn't start trading on the split adjusted basis July 20, don't you buy it June 25 at the presplit price, but since your not on record as a share holder June 21, do you get the split?"
2021-06-15 14:44:31,stocks,"Think of it a different way:

I think that stock XYZ is going to grow 20% this week, but I don't have any cash. I am going to sell stock ABC that I own. Stock ABC had good news this week, but XYZ had better news, so I can potentially make more money, so I sell stock ABC to be able to buy XYZ."
2021-06-15 14:38:13,stocks,I think “market” is not run by people that need good or bad news it’s run by people that are motivated to get a reward to make targets returns on the quarter etc and managing others money. Retail generally is to small to effect the market like the big funds and their actions are not exclusive to the daily news. We are little fish swimming with the sharks.
2021-06-15 14:42:04,stocks,"The market has been running up the past few days, so it's pulling back. Also, many hedge funds tend to sell their stocks on good news, predicting a top, which causes a decline in price and leaves everybody else holding the bag."
2021-06-15 14:47:05,stocks,"It's kind of a meme, but everything you expect to happen tends to be highly priced in. So if people expect Facebook to do well, the stock will price this in, not on the day of the earnings report, but during that whole quarter. Those daily fluctuations is just the market doing its part at price discovery based on the info, trends and economical outlook at that present time. 

And because we are in a bull run, with access to cheap funds, this price discovery action tends to overcompensate.

So come the good news, the market already expects them. Heck, it expects even a bit better than good, because no one wants to miss out on the possibility of Facebook crushing it and the FED is giving money out to anyone who takes it, so it's not like you're going to have to go through massive hurdles to get your position on Facebook.

And that's why you get these 'red days' on good news. Your mistake is completely ignoring the run up that lead to the current stock price. That's where the money is."
2021-06-15 15:15:41,stocks,save yourself the headache and stop trying to understand the market and just invest
2021-06-15 16:37:02,stocks,"Don’t think of it as good news/bad news. Think of it as certainty/uncertainty. 

There are people a lot smarter than you and I who have already come up with dozens of scenarios about how different stories may impact certain stocks. Some of these scenarios may be quite bullish, or quite bearish. Uncertainty in the outcome gives a stock its volatility. 

When news comes in, all those possibilities are narrowed down. Even if it’s good news, it could be that there were better scenarios out there, or that the current price is equal or higher than what had been projected for that scenario (maybe it already ran up in anticipation of the news). 

Wall Street does get surprised, but in most cases, when there’s a pullback on “good news,” it’s because the scenarios that were even more optimistic have gone away and there’s more agreement on fair value. Wall Street doesn’t really care about what the stock is worth now, it’s what it will be worth in the future, so when that future is a bit more clear, price fall in line with revised expectations."

It's a rookie mistake ro belive stocks only move on news good or bad.

- the market is so big and complex you gotta be careful assuming connections between the any particular news story, and any particular stock. you could often assume a correlation between your breakfast and stocks. ""Home Depot rises on fried eggs, Microsoft down on lumpy gravy."" this would be about as accurate. 

- larger company stocks that have high trading volume often move in tandem, based on what sector or fund/ETF trades them. if one big stocks goes up or down, it will often drag the entire sector around. the problem might not be with Moderna, but with United Health and they're all traded together in big healthcare ETFs. 

- look up ""mean reversion"". mean as in average. all stocks, individually and collectively, will tend to revert to a long-term average or equilibrium. so any stock that's gone up like a rocket, like Novovax over the last 6 months, will come down eventually."

I stay away from ARK funds as the maintenance fees are too high for me.  While I do invest in tech stocks like Verizon (VZ) and real estate such as Realty Income (O) and Avalon Bay (AVB), I also try to balance out these riskier investments with more stable long term holdings like Home Depot (HD), Public Storage (PSA), AbbVie (ABBV), and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM).  The only ETFs I hold are Guggenheim Strategic Opportunities Fund (GOF) and Cornerstone Strategic Value Fund (CLM), though these constitute a small portion of my overall portfolio as I know they are inherently risky and prone to significant price fluctuations.

&#x200B;

In part, NASA is opposing SpaceMobile due to the size of the satellites and the proximity to NASA’s “A-Train” satellites. NASA said the AST plan poses an “unacceptably high risk” of collision in space and would require a great deal of work daily to prevent it. The Observer reported that each AST satellite would need large phased-array antennas that span 900 square meters to mitigate risk.  
  
The space agency is also concerned with AST’s lack of experience. NASA estimates that up to 10 percent of the SpaceMobile satellites may fail, which would make them even more challenging to maneuver around.

2021-06-15 17:31:55,stocks,Thanks for the analysis. One thing I think could be worth digging a bit deeper into is how the distance to the satellites limits the possible frequencies. I’m guessing buzzwords like 5G and “6G forward compatible” doesn’t mean that much if it’ll be limited to the low-band frequencies most of the time?

2.  The satellites are more powerful than other LEO satellites doing a similar task (a la IRDM or Starlink). IIRC a satellite phone sends signals just a bit farther than a standard cell phone. So if you make up for the difference by boosting the satellite instead, it should be feasible.

2021-06-15 18:34:27,stocks,"> For a normal phone to connect to a satellite, the satellite must be big.

Why does the satellite's big size help? It doesn't boost the signal from the phone.

Though they seem to say they support 2G upto 5G (and 5G doesn't necessarily mean 20+ GHz), so I suppose that helps with range. But the long range wifi builds require more power and/or a special antenna to go ~300 km at best and we can't have either.

From the web:

> With over 1,000 patent claims, the technology is highly proprietary, and exactly how it works cannot be disclosed. 

Sure... but also, patents should mean that you can talk about it.

> The latency is solved with software

This, in my life as a software engineer, has been code for ""we don't know yet"". And latency is a fundamental problem since you just cannot make the signal faster. But seems that the Spacemobile satellites are much lower than the old satellite phone satellites (720km vs 23000km) so the latency is much less."
2021-06-15 19:25:17,stocks,"i'm sorry, i don't understand. the maximum range of normal cellphones is ~50km (limited by the radios in the cell phones). how can my cell phone talk to a satellite in LEO that's 300km away?"

The satellite's extra power gives it the ability to listen closer to the ground than a standard satellite (a la IRDM) and also lets it send signals farther down to the ground.


To continue the rock analogy its as if the satellite has Mr Fantastic stretchy arms to throw and catch the rock closer to you than it otherwise could with standard arms."

I think that LNG is going to be expanded at a faster rate than most people realize. Coal use is **still rising** in the world and there's no way to replace it all with wind/solar. The cleaner choice that is readily available is nat gas. 

I don't really look into NG powered vehicles. But I know power generation is a must have.

EV is definitely the way of the future IMO — anything associated with petroleum products and/or carbon emissions doesn't have that much room to grow.

And as far as *commercial* EV stocks go, there's Lion Electric (LEV), Lightning eMotors (ZEV), and Proterra (PTRA), among others.

You would literally have to use solar generated electricity to extract the hydrogen, and coal to generate the electricity in an EV in order for hydrogen to come out ahead, which is obviously not a fair comparison.

The weakness of EVs though, and where Hydrogen still shines is in hauling a heavy amount of cargo. The weight of the batteries you need to add to carry the cargo a long distance with an EV currently kills the efficiency too much. 

However, imo, I think it's only a matter of time until improvements in our battery tech take away that advantage from Hydrogen. It used to be considered impossible to make an EV pickup truck, or an EV semi truck, but both are about to enter the market in another year or two. imo EV planes will eventually become viable as well overtime, despite being considered impossible today."

Natural Gas may not be the holy grail of clean energy, but it's impact is still the most immediate and realistic. We won't have to achieve some unrealistic goal (such as making our entire electric grid powered by windmills) to make natural gas engines help the environment in a significant capacity, in fact a natural gas fueling company will install the adapter on anyone's house for free.

PSCE is the small cap energy ETF and has been beating XLE, a large cap energy ETF. If you check out the companies in it, you can see why.  There are many that are making money hand over fist, have low debt and are very undervalued.

However, I found something that I'm curious about. In the [NASDAQ Trade Halts page](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=TradeHalts), there are 2 columns regarding resumption time: 1) resumption quote time and 2) resumption trade time and the resumption trade time will either be at the same time as resumption quote time or after the resumption quote time. My questions are:

1. if I understand correctly, we can start trading at or after the resumption trade time, why don't they make it as one? why don't the resumption quote time and resumption trade time are the same time?
2. since the resumption quote time comes before the resumption trade time, the trades are not allowed to be executed, how can the price be changed during those time, since there are no movement?

Thank you very much!"
2021-06-15 12:13:52,stocks,"So you can place orders before trading resumes.  They will queue up and execute once trading resumes.  These orders will effect the price that the stock will open at.  Resuming quotes early will give traders a better idea of what price the stock will trade at when it resumes trading.  There technically is no price for a stock.  There is a bid, ask, and last.  Normally the last is what is quoted as the price but a trade will only occur if the bid is greater than or equal to the ask.  This can happen by people offering to pay more or people offering to sell for less.  So in that respect the price will move without any trading occurring."

2021-06-15 19:40:47,stocks,"I planned to buy CRSR the same morning it went wild, but woke up after the premarket rush, and didn't want to get involved in what was happening yesterday beyond a quick $200 day trade. Reddit was not the reason I was watching.

Reasons:

There was no Corsair specific news yesterday, but E3 was going on that same weekend. I expected Microsoft to have an amazing show, after buying several of my all time favorite mid-budget independent game developers a few years ago with no new game announcements from them yet. 

I also knew that Sony, their main competitor for AAA game presentations at E3, was not showing at E3. Microsoft would win the show by default, and almost all of their ""exclusives"" are also on PC at launch, and available through Game Pass.

People are still sitting on 970 and 1080 cards after many many years, wanting to upgrade but never feeling like it's the right time. The 970 and 1080 cards were extremely popular, but the next generation was a minimal upgrade, and the next after that was way overpriced. People have just been waiting way too damn long to build a PC until prices fall. A major reason they haven't is crypto mining. Crypto hype seems to have peaked a month ago, and now there's major pullback. Not something I pay much attention to, but if the bubble can burst, video card sales will be driven by games again, and that means Corsair cooling options will be desirable for new gaming rigs, as well as Corsair RAM and Corsair Cherry Red mechanical keyboards.

As for stocks that play into that prediction, NVDA and MSFT prices move on matters way bigger than gaming, matters I know nothing about, and LOGI seems to be a company aiming higher than my interest as well, but I avoid that simply due to 3 gaming mice breaking on me in 6 years. They're all pretty expensive. As for the non-MSFT games I'm excited about, those companies aren't publicly traded.

Just in general, I see the games market moving away from consoles and towards PCs. Many disagree with me on that, but I've been saying that since PS4, and PS5 has been extremely hard to get. I think people are losing patience on getting a PS5 and looking instead to XBox Game Pass, which supports not just XBox, but also PC. 

With the economy re-opening, those who returned to work have buying power on Amazon Prime Day, in one week, to buy PC parts. Those who are bearish on Corsair like to point to Logitech as the better company, which may be true, but to me it feels like they're doing different things. 

As for yesterday? 

I was warned pre-market that there were a ton of Corsair bagholders out there who spent the last few months watching it fall from mid-40s to mid-30s. The pre-market surge would result in a massive amount of people waking up that morning and seeing a good opportunity to finally get out of the stock they've been holding since February. They did. The stock dropped hard. The people who planned to buy it that day, either because of Reddit or because of E3, saw an opportunity to ride the dip back up again, and it simply did not stagger significantly at any point on the way up. The stock was almost to the same level it had been pre-market with just an hour to go on the day, so when it failed to go any higher, bagholders who missed that morning opportunity to bail out and day traders riding the charts dropped it at the same time, causing a plunge so fast and hard it was felt in the following trading day.

Most people trade stocks based on numbers and charts. I just go by how the wind feels. I see Corsair sailing on it, not as a WSB stock, because I think that moment has passed, but as a stock that should be able to rise on its own merits."

sure... but it's in a cutthroat and an extremely low-margin retail hardware business.

I own this stock, I'm up on this stock, but I'm astounded at how many comments state it's a good stock because it's a good company. One doesn't follow the other especially in an industry with razor thin margins.

If the argument is ""rising tide lifts all boats and gaming is a rising tide"" sure, I buy that. But I've literally see people going ""gamers have strong brand loyalty and CRSR is like Apple with high quality products"".

But they don't, gamers have brand loyalty to consoles or systems. Other than that their loyalty is to playing more video games. If buying RAZER gear when their mouse breaks means they can afford more games on the next steam sale or GOG, most gamers are looking for the most affordable hardware that allows them to purchase more games."

Basically most of these companies will have one new model of product this year at most, mostly selling old stuff. But because gaming is growing, and corsair is gaming, it will somehow take over all of gaming and grow. Now I don't know what the shareprice will do, but I do know what the company wont do.

2021-06-15 19:39:01,stocks,"> most gamers are looking for the most affordable hardware that allows them to purchase more games.

This is clearly wrong. ""gamer tax"" is a thing. Keyboards, chairs, whatever it is, if it's marketed at gamers then it comes with a marked up price. This shows that people are willing to pay for either the brand or the quality.

Brand loyalty exists somewhat, insofar as if I buy a great mouse I am more likely to buy a mouse from the same company next time. Although I'd say the biggest thing is the reverse, where if I buy a shit mouse I won't touch that company again. Corsair's products are great, so while people get burned on buying razer or whatever else, corsair's market share will grow (Which it has been) as long as they keep making good products."
2021-06-15 15:53:23,stocks,"100% NOT true! There are gamers (myself included) that have brand loyalty. Also, what’s the point in playing the game if your just gonna buy shitty hardware then your gonna get pissed and chuck that shit across the room when it fucks up.

I do follow the company's products and some of the stuff these people say is just way out there.

Oh and if you go into pc components, there's even way more and a ton of actually really reputable ones.

Written into the rules of the prospectus you will find how and how often they do this. The S&P 500 is updated by S&P 4 times a year. They will drop and add companies and they are weighted by how much they are capitalized. 

Many ETFs that index the S&P 500 will update their holdings once a month to reflect when companies are added or taken away from the index, but they are updated the weight to which companies are capitalized within the index. Company #450 will be a much smaller portion of the index than company #10. 

So as companies get larger or smaller, the ETFs are slowly downsizing them over time. As they get larger, they are slowly upsized over time.

This is why company failures in ETFs are typically rare"

From report:

The company went public in a 3-way merger between (1) DraftKings, (2) its SPAC sponsor, and (3) a Bulgaria-based gaming technology company called SBTech.  
SBTech accounted for \~25% of total revenue at the SPAC consummation and was the only positive contributor to operating income, providing both financial stability and technology to the deal.  
Unbeknownst to investors, DraftKings’ merger with SBTech also brings exposure to extensive dealings in black-market gaming, money laundering and organized crime.  
Based on conversations with multiple former employees, a review of SEC & international filings, and inspection of back-end infrastructure at illicit international gaming websites, we show that SBTech has a long and ongoing record of operating in black markets.  
We estimate that roughly 50% of SBTech’s revenue continues to come from markets where gambling is banned, based on an analysis of DraftKings’ SEC filings, conversations with former employees, and supporting documents.  
As one former employee told us, DraftKings’ subsidiary SBTech has ""sold to plenty of mobs"", a sharp contrast to the clean image of DraftKings’ brand-conscious partners, including the NFL, NBA, NASCAR, UFC and PGA, and the company’s recent hire of supermodel Gisele Bundchen to advise on governance issues.  
Prior to the SPAC merger, SBTech seems to have made a concerted effort to distance itself from its black-market dealings. Illicit customer relationships were shuffled into a newly formed “distributor” entity called BTi/CoreTech, with \~50 SBTech employees shifted across town to the new entity.  
The CEO selected to run BTi/CoreTech was formerly an executive of a 'binary options' gambling firm raided by the FBI and subsequently charged by the SEC for deceiving U.S. investors out of over $100 million.  
Former SBTech employees called BTi/CoreTech a “front”, and said the split preserved SBTech’s (and now DraftKings’) illicit business while shielding the public company from scrutiny. For all practical purposes, it appears that BTi/CoreTech functions as DraftKings’ undisclosed illegal gaming division.  
We identified numerous black market clients of DraftKings’ “front” entity, through searches on social media and back-end web infrastructure. For example, an Asia-focused site tied to a triad kingpin at the center of a Swiss money laundering investigation advertises its use of BTi/CoreTech technology.  
In 2019, Vietnamese authorities arrested 22 individuals involved in a “massive illegal online sports betting ring"" linked to BTi/CoreTech's platform.  
Contrary to representations made to Oregon’s state lottery, a former employee told us SBTech had extensive operations in Iran, violating local laws in a market subject to heavy U.S. sanctions. We were told SBTech knowingly operated there for 4-5 years with the founder directly overseeing the operation.  
Around the time of the DraftKings deal, SBTech’s founder spun off another gaming entity that also operated in markets where gambling was banned, transferring it to his brother. The brand was behind a “massive Chinese operation”, according to a former employee, contrary to representations made to Oregon’s state lottery.  
The brand continues to operate in China despite the strict local rules prohibiting online gambling, according to our review of web infrastructure for multiple China-facing gambling sites. DraftKings continues to transact with the entity, according to SEC filings.  
DraftKings trades at a \~26x last twelve months (LTM) sales multiple and a \~20x estimated 2021 sales multiple despite (i) no expectation of earnings for years, (ii) intense competition, and (iii) regulatory risk. The company posted net losses of $844 million in 2020 and $346 million last quarter.  
Insiders have dumped over $1.4 billion in stock since the company went public a little over a year ago, with SBTech’s founder leading the pack, having personally sold \~$568 million in shares.  
Despite a rocky track record prior to taking DraftKings public, the company’s SPAC sponsors ultimately received 9.3 million shares, worth around $114 million at the time, in exchange for a token $25 thousand contribution."

I suspect some of these elements exist at Draftkings but also think they are trying hard to legitimize. I see this taking a couple of years and I think it is priced in. Price target $60."

2021-06-15 10:58:42,stocks,">First, a company called SB Tech who is associated to DKNG is shady

I think that's putting it super lightly since they are basically now the same company post-merger -- merging with a company is not just being ""associated"" with a company. You're making it sound like SBTEch was some rogue vendor for DKNG.

Although, at the end of the day, I don't really see this as crippling news. Maybe even a buying opportunity after it bleeds a bit more. They can just take the path of other major tech companies: cease operations of the shady parts and just pay some fines. It probably makes sense to wait for any announcements of regulatory investigations as that can tank the stock further."

>""While not ideal, in a worst case scenario, an SBTech issue would not necessarily interfere with betting operations today,"" he added. ""We would use today’s weakness as an opportunity ahead of potential Canada legalization as well as New York, both of which are catalysts for DraftKings."""

They aren’t saying its all a complete fraud in the same way they called out Lordstown and Nikola?

One piece I will mention is Hindenburg released a similar short report for Grow Generation (GRWG) at the $9 range in Aug 2020. They said the management team had a highly questionable history, the business was doing well but they couldn’t trust the management team. That stock is currently sitting at $40.

Their title includes “70% downside” and that was when the ticker sat at $9. So if anything I’d assume they increased their position as the share price rose.

2021-06-15 12:39:57,stocks,I am pretty sure that is not correct.  I am also not aware of laws that don't allow them to make too much profit. The laws are based on hold percentage which does not include any operational or marketing costs and are just about how much money they make from the bets themselves.  Most of the hold regulations in states actually ensure a minimum hold percentage not a maximum because the states want to make sure that they are getting their cut as the tax rates are based on the hold not profitability since the states don't care about marketing costs (some of which is not specific to any given state).

• **Risk happens fast but markets move faster** – By the time that covid restrictions to enable flattening of the curve were happening, the s&p500 was already down like -35%. Markets have bottomed already by this time as markets move way faster than the risk. While most people assess and understand risk in real-time based on watching the news or reading articles, the stock market had already anticipated the risks before they become widely known. When most investors realize that it’s going to be a recession or an economic crisis, it’s too late.

The biggest gains are made at the depth of the crisis and biggest losses happens when everything seems to be rosy. The market is a future discounting mechanism and all the bad news was quickly priced-in already. It’s the economic recovery that the market will be pricing in after peak fear on the unknown has been discounted.

• **It’s a good thing for the markets when the majority’s expectations on the economy are so low** –When covid was hitting countries left and right and the first lockdowns started, almost everyone was expecting gloom and doom for the global economy and almost no one expected a V-shaped recovery. I remember most we’re calling for a U back then. But when people slowly realized that it’s not going to be the end of the world and corporate earnings after covid lockdowns were implemented started to come out? The stock market just never looked back again.

This just shows that equity markets care far less about economic outcomes in vacuums and far more about whether the outcomes exceeded expectations. We could see all the worse earnings numbers and gdp reports that we will ever see in our lifetimes, but when the expectations are just massively low, even a slightly better than expected earnings report will cause the stock market to rally. And this thing kind of happened last year when people thought that it’s going to be apocalypse.

• **Event-Driven Bear markets are vicious but lack stamina** – This is the type of bear market that we’ve experienced last year. It was a huge and fast collapse in march 2020 compared to other bear markets in the past. This one is an easier environment to trade on for active traders because of large swings and extreme volatility and recovery is much more faster too.

Other types of bear markets that we can experience are those that are:

Structural in nature (imbalances and financial bubbles, price shocks, deflation) – harder to trade because it’s more of a slow death and slow recovery.

Cyclical - regular business cycle typically happens during periods of high inflation and rising interest rates, slow death too

• **Initial Jobless Claims as a key indicator for recessions and bear markets** – Stock market bottoms almost exactly the time when initial jobless claims reach a peak. It was really confusing back in march 2020 when there was one trading session where futures are down big and suddenly reversed into green and went on a rally when the first post-covid lockdown, initial jobless claims report was given out. People had a hard time coping up with reality during that time on how the stock market can go up when the unemployment number was really terrible and millions lost their jobs. Then I read the insights of analysts on why that kind of thing happened and I realized that people thought that the unemployment numbers can’t get any worse than that anymore and jobless claims have reached a peak, the stock market was already looking ahead by years into the future and betting that the worst is over. Just like how the stock market plummeted well before anyone grasped the full damage to the job market. The market was correct too as the jobless numbers went on a steady decline after that and now we are even seeing labor shortages in USA.

• **Last but not the least, “Don’t Fight the Fed”** – probably the single most important lesson that we have witnessed, real-time throughout this crisis. Should’ve went all-in already in March 2020, without hesitations when the fed was able to throw the whole kitchen sink after they were allowed to backstop the whole corporate credit market and even junk bonds, credit spreads stopped imploding after this. Turmoil on the market was calmed down, equities went on a non-stop lockout rally while most people we’re waiting for another crash to happen again.

I remember there was even one trading session back in June 2020 where the dow was trading down like 900-1000 points throughout the day and suddenly the fed just said something on press release like they are going to add more to their corporate bond purchases, the 1000 point drop was magically erased intraday. This crisis was basically one whole playground for the fed and we saw how powerful these central banks are in creating a boom cycle for the markets."
2021-06-15 09:32:49,stocks,Everything that pumps in the premarket dumps at open. Its just the way it is
2021-06-15 16:01:47,stocks,Hindsight is always 2020
2021-06-15 14:42:56,stocks,"there is a simple explanation to alot of your lessons which involve the stock market reacting before news is widely known. And that is the insiders know, they got deep pockets and they react immediately and have the least losses and usually have all the gains. Simple as that!

TLDR: By the time it's in the news, the insiders already capitalized."
2021-06-15 19:50:18,stocks,"I deeply regret investing too conservatively last year, during the biggest bull run in this generation. I feel so jelly reading about all you guys who got into the high growth stocks that skyrocketed, who got into Tesla under 100, etc. This was a once in a generation opportunity that I blew."
2021-06-15 10:56:58,stocks,"Uh... the fed is currently reaping the benefits of its decisions back then. Yes, you can't fight the fed short term, but eventually the bill comes due. Today it is an insane reverse repo market like we've never seen before on the daily. The amount of liquidity that exists in banks today is dangerously high. Combine that with inflation and the bill will come due. When? I'd be rich if I knew when."
2021-06-15 08:59:51,stocks,"Some good tidbits of learning from this last year and I can relate to similar sentiments. But if you've been watching the market since last March when your portfolio plummeted then yea you would have seen these trends. 

One thing you didn't touch on is the absolute workhorse the Fed has been during this time with Quantitative Easing and how that has given a safety net to the market and with low rates has opened the door to huge margin trading and subsequent pouring of money into the market. This V recovery from the initial downturn because of the Fed led to a huge spike in retail trading last November and thru today. 

My point is you very well could have written a bunch of different points here in another timeline where the Fed didn't give the market a massive life boat. “Don’t Fight the Fed”  Long JPOW"
2021-06-15 09:19:56,stocks,Do you think we are in a bubble? Is the market still trying to correct itself? Or are we at the beginning of a bull run?

2021-06-15 10:51:19,stocks,"is the entire market overvalued - probably not.

are certain sectors/tickers wildly overvalued - you bet your ass they are

is this a systemic or pervasive problem - probably not"
2021-06-15 09:47:47,stocks,Life is a bubble when you really think about it.
2021-06-15 09:54:48,stocks,"As someone who learned so much in 2008, bubbles give investors like us a real chance at changing our lives. Always have cash on hand to buy the dips, especially the really big ones. Don’t count on the news on CNN/Fox. I adjusted for Rona in January 2020 because of world news. Best of luck in the next downturn. It’ll definitely come. But you’ll be prepared!"
2021-06-15 10:33:26,stocks,We are always in a bubble
2021-06-15 10:19:07,stocks,Are we in a bubble after arguably the biggest worldwide crisis in most of our lifetimes? That covid crash was hard and to predict another crash even 2 years after that seems odd to me. We might see a cooldown once things are fully reopened and supply catches up with demand but who really knows
2021-06-15 09:40:56,stocks,"Are you referring to the US? Bubble is only in meme stocks. Rest if fine. As per me, US is going to underperform the rest of the world markets this decade. People will be quick to jump saying that's impossible, but it is possible. Emerging markets and Europe will boom, Japan too. US will have to stay behind this time around.

I do expect a healthy 15-20% correction later this year across the world markets due to some bad news.

Also never worry about bubble. Just continue investing with discipline and there should be no problems."
2021-06-15 12:35:26,stocks,"So basically banks have too much cash and there aren’t any worthy instruments to put the cash in. To a bank, cash is liabilities, not assets which is why they buy treasury bonds, etc…

The reverse repo then allows the banks to (overnight at 0%) park their cash using treasury bonds so that they can meet their capital requirements. This has been going up every day for the last 2 weeks. What will happen when they cannot meet these requirements? I believe that’s why people are betting on a market crash."
2021-06-15 11:47:37,stocks,"Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles!!"
2021-06-15 10:57:21,stocks,Hitting new highs continously one year into a pandemic doesn‘t seem odd to you just because the initial crash happened?
2021-06-15 11:03:56,stocks,what is the reasoning for Europe booming?
2021-06-15 13:38:11,stocks,I still don't understand but that's on me 🤣 thanks for the explanation anyway
2021-06-15 11:27:01,stocks,"Once the initial crash happened all the pandemic fear was priced into every stock. As fear eased, the market corrected back to the prices they had prior to fear being priced in. It just happened to be that prior to fear being priced in a lot of these stocks were at or flirting with ATH"
2021-06-15 11:03:23,stocks,I agree we could see a pullback forsure and I believe the whole system is propped up and that the fed will keep throwing money at it. How long would this supposed crash last? The fed would turn the money printer right back on and buy the dip.
2021-06-15 11:09:51,stocks,Because it didn't boom last decade
2021-06-15 13:40:39,stocks,"Yeah, it’s a fairly complex issue. I just know that the fact that banks are increasingly using reverse repo operations in record capacity day after day can’t be a good sign of stability. I’m sure there’s youtubers out there doing a better job than I am at explaining this stuff. 

Long story short though: we’re gonna see the consequences of the insane amount of money that has been printed since covid started."
2021-06-15 12:42:55,stocks,"That doesn‘t explain anything I said. The financial outlook of most companies look much different that pre pandemic.

I am not saying we‘re in a bubble, just iverly optimistic in quite a few sectors"
2021-06-15 12:00:07,stocks,Bruh..
2021-06-15 13:01:11,stocks,">That doesn‘t explain anything I said.

After learning about different investment styles, it’s determined I am more of an ETF person.

2021-06-15 10:07:30,stocks,"Buy and hold. Timing the market is difficult and people often lose money jumping in and out of the market, especially if they are inexperienced in doing this sort of thing.  If you are ""INVESTING,"" buy and hold.  If you are ""GAMBLING,"" buy and sell and buy and sell, or else just go to Vegas."

2021-06-15 12:19:12,stocks,"Difficult question. I bought a bunch of stocks as they were going up post November, and when a lot of them stopped going up, I recognized this and exited my positions, preserving capital. The question would be the same for a specific stock like CRWD or a highly focused stock like ARKK or ARKG. If something broad like VTI, which will yield the best results for most people overall, just buying and holding, or buying and buying more on dips (like, buy any time VTI touches its 50 day moving average and finds support),  is clearly a better strategy than what I'm doing."

having to pay taxes is a good problem to have, it means you're making money"
2021-06-15 12:22:49,stocks,QQQ is probably also a long term buy and hold. Growth might be coming back into favor.
2021-06-15 12:20:04,stocks,It significantly reduces returns compared to a buy and hold strategy
2021-06-15 09:10:22,stocks,It's not a problem. It's something one should be aware of. Unless you might end up with an amount that you have not budgeted for.
2021-06-15 12:20:49,stocks,"If you happen to be a in high tax bracket, and if you get a lot of short term capital gains, you pay 37% + whatever you pay in your state, potentially up to 13% if California. That's only for very rich people, but bottom line, buy and hold for 1+ years to get long term cap gains is a better strategy for ""investors"" (not traders, which isn't a good idea)."
2021-06-15 09:52:46,stocks,"It is a problem since you only pay taxes when you sell. If you buy and hold for 20 years, you'll pay no taxes (excluding dividends). Trading requires the person to outperform the market by a large margin to be worthwhile"

2021-06-15 00:00:00,stocks,"NVAX discussion. Long term hold or sell the news? Novavax just announced very good results from the US trial of their covid vaccine: 90% overall efficacy and 100% protection against moderate/severe disease. This is kind of a big deal as it puts them on par with the hugely successful mRNA vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna. It looks like only a matter of time before they become the next covid vaccine to be approved in most of the world.

If approved it can be an attractive option for those people that are holding out on getting vaccinated because they don’t trust mRNA vaccines (Novavax uses a more traditional approach). It’s easier to store and has relatively mild side effects compared to mRNA vaccines, which are not insignificant advantages. They also have a combined flu-covid vaccine in the pipeline which can turn out to be pretty big in the future. 

Unfortunately due to months of delays they missed the boat on contributing to the first wave of vaccinations in the developed world. Developing countries and booster shots are their main hope for revenue now, but the short term opportunity seems to have been squandered. The company has also expanded greatly in a short time and growing pains are evident. It’s still uncertain if they can actually deliver the vaccines promised despite their assurances that everything is ok.

Basically I’m trying to figure out what to do with my shares lol. Currently leaning towards the “sell now” camp but maybe someone can convince me otherwise."
2021-06-15 07:08:45,stocks,"This has really rallied before hand...not sure what's left
If it were me, I'd definitely sell the news"
2021-06-15 08:07:42,stocks,"They still have contracts for a billion doses not counting the deal for serum institute/covavax. I believe an approval from outside the US will come prior to September when it is expected to receive US EUA. It’s being sidelined in the US bc I believe the tech is safer and people will flat out refuse to take an mRNA vax once NVAX hits the market and they don’t have all 8 factories completely online to handle the demand yet. The company’s future revenue prospects are insane and their market cap is tiny compared to peers. Once jabs in arms begin, they will melt up to Moderna equivalent cap which would put them at a pps around 5-6x what it is now. All that is even before you look at the long term prospects in their pipeline, adjuvant licensing for malaria drug which is stellar, Nanoflu, and combo Nanoflu/covid vax. Their safety profile and tech also allows them to create multivalent strains with the same amount of adjuvant meaning they will have the safest and most tolerable multivalent vaccine. mRNA vaccines cannot be produced for multiple strains in one shot without risking people’s health. They are the turtle in the race but will ultimately beat the hare(s). The problem however is in the meantime, the stock can be traded. Only 75 million float and it is heavily manipulated. Any minor setback news can drill it 40-50 bucks at anytime. If you can stomach volatility and you hate FOMO, hold. If you can’t, sell and try to time a re-entry. I think the floor is 200 for the foreseeable future."

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

2021-06-15 06:28:25,stocks,"**SOFI**
summary of article from last night , saying Cup & Handle indicating a strong break out..

The author (excerpt below) is basically saying that a move above $23.75 in the next day or two (which completes the handle) ...would send Price much higher...

... (which lines up perfectly with what the
end of the order book has been showing all
week.. $23.50 is now basically the breaking
point for shorts...at which time the bulk of shorts will begin to cover quick and hard)... and after the 21M shares shorted the past two weeks, the total is around 45M shares..   **Also consistent with the weekly and monthly charts... indicating a strong move up today** ... Charts just posted on SOFI Stock Twits page.

**Article Quote/ Excerpt**
(Chart also  posted on SOFI Stock Twits page.. could not get image to post here)

It’s a classic in the world of growth stock investing. It’s called a corrective cup with handle base and it’s working on its finishing touches in SOFI stock. And for bullish investors that want a breakout play with the odds stacked in their favor, SOFI deserves a spot the short list of buys of this kind.

Technically and as the illustrated chart reveals, SoFi’s smaller handle consolidation has just entered its third week of construction. Development is occurring within the right side of the larger base and finding support off the 50% retracement level. At the same time, pattern resistance has formed at the 76% Fibonacci level.
Altogether, the construction of SOFI’s cup with handle is visually attractive for a nearby breakout and pending buy decision in SOFI stock if shares proceed to clear the high of handle.

Less characteristically of the cup-with-handle base, the handle’s depth of nearly 25% is wide by textbook standards of around 10%. More importantly , overall pattern volatility of both the cup and handle are observably congruent. And in this strategist’s estimation, that’s the overriding factor in setting up SOFI as a strong-looking cup with handle breakout candidate."

It was inevitably going to dip at least a bit given what it's done of late but I wonder if the reason that QQQ dropped today was more because of that tech antitrust activist being named to the FTC chair instead of the PPI read and instead of the Powell speech that is coming tomorrow."
2021-06-15 10:52:29,stocks,"Lmao PPI the biggest increase in history and retail sales actually went *down.*  This is insane.  Can't wait for tomorrow, it truly is a privilege to watch a blunder of historic proportions play out live.  I just hope it doesn't fuck too many people."

2021-06-15 09:08:41,stocks,"Can someone explain why the market cap values given on Yahoo Finance and Google finance would be drastically different? For most stocks, it looks like the number they give is equal or close enough to equal be explained by their stock prices not quite being real time and out of sync slightly, but I was trying to do some DD on EDR and found that the market cap value google finance gives is \~13B, but yahoo finance only has a value of \~7.5. Being off by a factor of two is a huge discrepancy and I can't figure out why they'd disagree by such a large amount."
2021-06-15 11:36:25,stocks,"They may modify their wording some, but I've got a bridge to sell you if you think that you're really going to see something wildly different from the same thing from Powell tomorrow.

Now, I may have said this on here (not sure), but the June and July CPI readings will interest me more. Honestly, I did get what I was looking for with May (a hot read, but not a blowout from what was expected). But if June and July don't trend the same way it will likely get interesting.

I don't they're telling the truth about a rate hike not happening before 2023, but then if I talk to my dad, he'd probably feel that they are based off what happened with the previous recession.

Like I've said though, I think the first one is going to be small, and then they're going to wait and see."

2021-06-15 09:01:00,stocks,"I'm not in on DKNG, nothing against them but the industry as a whole scares me and I don't think DKNG has the edge that some others think they do, but this line really stuck out...  

>In short, the market is pricing in perfect execution of a business with a stellar brand in a new market subject to intense competition and fraught with regulatory uncertainty. As we will show, we think the company is standing on several landmines that will inhibit its ability to fulfill the market’s lofty expectations."

Was literally planning on trimming my position today even before this (more because it's one of the first stocks I bought and my only thesis was ""sports gambling is growing""--since then I have learned more about fundamentals and didn't want to be as overweight DKNG at its valuation).

Just read the room, the emojis and meme stocks dont play here. And usually the hostility doesnt, it has here lately. But you can disagree with somebody respectfully. Hostility stifles creativity and inhibits sharing. Which is a loss for everybody.  This whole market is a giant experiment. The more sharing we do the better off we all are. 

Just dont turn it into wsb because the last couple weeks its felt just like it in a lot of ways.  If you guys prefer it so much stop turning it into wsb."

2021-06-15 11:34:16,stocks,"Banks are good long-term investments though.  heavily regulated and high profit margins and returns on equity, but with lower returns on assets (bc of their huge asset base).  Not sure if this still holds but 20 years ago, if you took all the publicly traded banks, chopped them into quartiles the poorest performing quartile was still net positive in returns.  Also there's tons of great info online on banks b/c of the regulation."
2021-06-15 13:55:28,stocks,Its a heavily shorted stock so maybe it went up with amc or something? I dunno - but I wouldn't touch it either way with a 10 foot pole.
2021-06-15 14:26:58,stocks,"My guess would be RIDE is getting bought out. They are out of cash, the CEO & CFO resigned, and they have announced that they will not be able to make any of their goals. The only thing they really have is their holdings at this point. I would imagine GM may be thinking of buying them up since they pretty much were GM's EV division."

I have no idea what your age is or trading experience, but these types of biotech/pharma companies come and go all the time.  The stock sales are usually to help fund the research until the bottom falls out.  Then they go Chapter 7 with a bunch of behind the scenes maneuvering allowing what ever sponsoring company, in this case Gilead, to scoop up the remaining assets for pennies.  

This isnt always the case, Im a believer in SENS, but this one smells like a duck."

DePo wanted Sean McDermott and Jimmy Haslam went with Hue Jackson, hahaha. Now look at McDermott with the Bills. Then, Haslam didn't listen to DePo and hired Freddie Kitchens over Kevin Stefanski, then FINALLY listened and hired Stefanski a year later. Haslam was living in an alternate reality until DePo finally brought him back around into this reality. Thank you Football Gods."

2021-06-15 06:57:19,stocks,Why that exact amount of time?
2021-06-15 07:06:48,stocks,"That's nearly impossible to tell. My theory is we will maintain the near-zero federal rates this year like Powell has said every single months for like a year now, so growth will be a great play the next 6 months coming off volatility and dips the last 4.5 months. But that's just my guess.

Disney is a nice combo of reopening and growth that should get a nice pop sometime in the 6 months, but it could also be like Apple and Amazon and trade sideways for a year before booming again, nobody can really know. If you want more potential, Roku. If you want safer, Amazon or Apple (FB has been owning it in faang lately)."
2021-06-15 07:24:35,stocks,"Also would be helpful to gauge your intended investment total or at least per share price target range.  Depending on what you're working on, spread between multiple might be your better option.  

Based on that timeline, you're mostly looking at companies who will have a great summer and (early) fall with high anticipated earnings but cashing out before they're reported.  Restaurant groups, retail, and travel might be some areas to initially explore for that timeline."
2021-06-15 07:55:46,stocks,Honestly $CLNE looks great for long term and $TRCH to hold through the merger for dividends and new shares to merged company.
2021-06-15 09:11:47,stocks,I honestly believe in BB (not as a meme).  BB increased its portfolio and has added a lot of new customers recently.  The stock is gonna increase a lot when it will be reflected in revenue. 6 months look a good timeline.

2021-06-15 10:19:43,stocks,"It's starting to come up more and more today.

But WSB is more of a mess than usual right now, new tickers come up almost daily, old tickers get disregarded and rotated out of just as quickly as people got in. They actually have some decent (imo) tickers there right now, but unless you know them it's not easy to filter out which ones are bs and which ones could actually be promising.

So don't expect a huge, prolonged rise of PLTR because of WSB."

2021-06-15 09:58:41,stocks,"Seems like a major disorganized approach right now.  There are shots all over the place, which could be great for a longterm portfolio investment or risk reduction.  Hard to see one actually going ""to the moon"" soon.  

WOOF down 8%.  RIDE up 2.5%.  Feels like the WSB public metric is going to be factored in at some point by some tangible number in the summary tab by major platforms, just for due diligence to keep SEC happy."

2021-06-15 12:04:48,stocks,"The issue is that their great financial result will likely be that their debt has loosened. The problem is that it’s the result of huge stock dilutions on top of previous dilutions.

There is zero fundamental reason for their market cap to exist at this level. No fundamental reason for it to even be half of what it is."

2021-06-15 12:12:30,stocks,"Not an accurate depiction. We know inflation is rising. All that matters if the Fed Reserve thinks it's so hot that they need to raise Federal Interest Rates early. Which they have said repeatedly they won't do, that their concern is unemployment all year, but the market then decides ""nah, they're lying every month (since last year).""

Today is all about the fact that there's a meeting tomorrow. If the meeting is the same as usual, expect a boom for everything but especially tech and growth. If the speculators are right this time (personally, I highly doubt it, and more and more Bloomberg interviews are starting to agree with me), then it's gonna suck, but at least of lot of this has already been priced in relative to January.

Could easily be June 3rd part two.

Could easily even end up being the second week of January part two.

But what I'm actually looking for to happen is something like the March case (no, not what happened early in the month, what happened from March 17th-March 24th). So, you may get a bit of a discount but not much...in fact, based off seasonality after OPEX in June, the surprise would be no dip at all (and this is in general)."

You can check state revenue numbers from sports betting, they aren't hidden anyway, and DKNG's numbers can mostly be verified through that. The rest of the report mostly seems like DKNG turning a blind eye to it and the belief that they are well overvalued. 

This is still not good at all and definitely people who are in DKNG should be taking this report seriously, but to say DraftKings is getting most of its money from shady/illegal means is a big reach"

Also the LSE does things in pence, which are basically cents, so the 100 isn't dollars. Since the U.K. and the U.S. are different countries, they use different currencies

So RR = 1 dollar.

I will say the guy who is posting is actually a fucking ape, because RYCEY is the U.S. actual play on LSE's RR. What he is talking about is RLLCF, which really has nothing to do with the stock itself and is a niche type of offering by RR through JPM that is similar to a bond. 

If someone is buying what he's talking about you're essentially playing on overall RR profit vs interest rates, which makes it (1) more risky/profitable but (2) importantly, actually makes what he's saying legitimate gibberish. If he thinks there won't be a profit for another year there's really no reason to put any money in RLCCF because you can't ""play"" zero profit. Thus, why RLCCF is so much cheaper than RYCEY (the ADR ticker) or RR"

Around the last quarterly rebalancing time period, with the way QQQ was languishing, the obvious move would have been a drop below 310, but it took too long, so you saw it end up going the other way instead and set a new record high a couple weeks later.

The TL;DR here is I think QQQ is fine at $330 and above. Maybe come in, build a bull flag (which is what that March stretch turned out to be), and then burn the doubters and bears (of which I'm not the latter even if you see my complaining) and move to $350+ in July.

Most brokerages offer fractional shares, so you could invest that $10 into any company that you'd like. Investing $10 once will not make you rich, but if you invest $10 on a regular basis into the right companies, then over time you should see some nice returns."

They are going to give you a share of something. You choose when to sell it. Whatever you sell it for is now money in your account.

Honestly if this is confusing to you then I would suggest you do a lot of research before jumping into the market. There are great books out there and great YouTube videos that will go over almost anything you have a question about. Never put in more money than you can afford to lose, especially when you just start out. Maybe even start with a paper money account so you can learn how to trade/invest without risking your actual money."

Either people have jobs and are being productive or they don't.  You can't have both.  

You're right that there's supply issues, and you're also right that demand is surging right now.  But what doesn't make sense is that demand is surging while production is still not at normal levels and people aren't working.  So what's causing all that extra demand?"

You want an article? Here's one, and it came from a literal 2 second google search:

https://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2BP0ZI

Demand is surging because the people who didn't lose their jobs last year, ie most people, who have been literally stuck at home last year, have now roughly two years of spending they want to do this summer since they didn't spend shit on anything last year. It's not rocket science man. These people want to travel, they want to eat out, basically all of the crap they didn't do last year people want to do now. And they have extra savings to do it.

Remember all the stimulus money that's been given by Congress, which has been in large part financed by the Fed: 
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FDHBFRBN

It shouldn't be a mystery, but here's an article explaining how overly-accomodative monetary policy can lead to inflation;
https://www.kbc.com/en/economics/publications/qe20-and-inflation-this-time-its-different.html

He was predicting only moderate inflation as of September 2020, but he says that there's a risk that they overstay their welcome, which is exactly what's being talked about right now.

You know, I could be wrong, maybe it's just transitory.  But the claim that it's definitely transitory is no longer credible given the data we're seeing. My belief is that it's not, but I could be wrong.

The problem I see with the Fed is that they are stubbornly pressing forward with their policies, which may be fine, but each month with this brings us closer and closer to taking things too far and causing real unintended consequences.

At the very least there needs to be some honest reflection about what's going on right now, and the humility to admit that, hey, this is unprecedented and we should be taking precautions to prepare for a scenario which doesn't match with our predictions.

I do find it telling that the expectations for both CPI and PPI, YoY and MoM, come in lower than the actual data every single month.  The same people who are underestimating the level of inflation are the ones who are saying it's transitory."
2021-06-15 13:26:51,stocks,"I didn't dismiss it.

I literally said, it's probably the smallest factor in the rise in prices were seeing.

I could be wrong, however, based on what I've read I think the reason we have high inflation yoy is, ranked:

1. Labor/supply issues. (Will normalize)

2. Pent up demand. (Will normalize)

3. Prices actually went down this time last year, so yoy price increases are a little skewed. (Currently reflected in the data)

4. Remember negative oil? Yeah. That was this time last year. Now it's normalized, again contributing to yoy price increases. Countries cut oil production this time last year, btw. OPEC had a historic cut. I don't know if they have returned to previous production levels. This will level out soon if not already.

4. Us govt stimulus.

5. Low interest rates from the fed.

So, imo, and I'm not a bloody economist, there's a lot in play here. And sure the stimulus has a part, but honestly it's probably the smallest part.

Btw, the fed and yellen are already talking about tapering and rising rates. They're already starting to set expectations that this won't last forever. It's in the works."

If I wanted to write a program to do any sort of analysis of my portfolio or historical stock prices, where could I get data on stock prices from? I can already export data on my transaction history, so I just need an API to query stock prices.

This would be purely for personal use. I have no intention of making my program public, so I'm hoping there are usable free options. 

All I really need is the ability to see current stock prices (ideally real time, last market close is also good), and the ability to see past stock prices. Only really need access to NASDAQ and NYSE, since everything I currently own is on those two. 

Ideally looking for something with a REST API, not too concerned about ease of use as long as the design isn't intentionally obtuse.

I've been looking into the free version of alphavantage recently which seems pretty good (500 requests per day). Does anyone here have suggestions or advice as to which platforms are good?


EDIT: I've been doing research and have stumbled across Tiingo. It's free version has very generous rate limits and all I really want is current and historical price data, which Tiingo provides.

2021-06-15 08:33:07,stocks,"I use Interactive Brokers. It isn't totally free as you pay a subscription fee for the markets you want real-time data for, but the subscription fee is usually pretty low (depends on the exchange). The main benefit is that the Python API is pretty easy to work with. Basically you install Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation software on your computer, and then the Python API communicates with a running instance of the Trader Workstation, rather than communicating with a remote server, which IMHO makes life easier as a developer. For snapshot requests the limit is 100 per second which is something I also really like about their API. For real-time streaming the limit depends on trading activity but the base number is 100 simultaneous streams which again is pretty damn good in my experience."

2021-06-15 00:00:00,stocks,"If history is any guide, next week’s gonna be ugly?! Cramer said today. “If you’re a nimble trader, you might want to sell the S&P at the opening next Monday then swap back in near the end of the week.”

“Based on <some guy’s> analysis, shorting the market next week has been a good strategy for at least the last 22 years”, he said. “If the S&P starts getting crushed, I want you to remember that you’re up against a powerful seasonal trend. You want to start bottom fishing.”

What do you make of this?"
2021-06-14 23:13:22,stocks,I guess I’d say I’m not planning on cashing out my portfolio for another 15 years so I’ll have a great buying opportunity if that happens. I’m not selling anything based off hearsay and conjecture.

2021-06-15 00:33:39,stocks,September/October is typically worse. Just buy Long VIX Calls for December and worst case you have some losses to go against your major wins as market continues to make ATHs all year or if we spike you have free cash to average down. I do this every February after Q4 starts to wind down. It’s a Win/Win every year. Plus VIX can go UP with the market unlike Puts that only capture downside.

2021-06-15 10:19:16,stocks,It's an especially terrible idea for anyone holding long-term in a taxable account. Selling and buying back in a week later is a great way to make sure you pay more taxes.

I also think he has aspergers, those people have trouble knowing when someone is lying to them. He gets lied to a lot, especially when it is someone who he thinks is a friend.

So why are there so many individual investors then and why doesn't everyone just put their money into index funds? 

I'm confused because yes the point is to make money, but there have to be downsides to just blindly putting your money into index funds because I see rarely if ever many people doing that strategy."

2021-06-14 21:44:08,stocks,Because everyone thinks they can be in the other 10-20%
2021-06-14 21:48:23,stocks,It’s simple. The returns are slow and steady with index funds with much less chance of losing money. The potential for returns is much faster with individual stocks and because of that so is your potential to lose money quickly. The only reason index funds behave the way they do is because they’re simply a collection of stocks so it spreads the risk and slows down the upward trend. That’s it.
2021-06-14 23:18:21,stocks,"With index funds, it’s a near guaranteed slow return. With your own investments, you have the potential for dramatic returns(and losses). 

Some people think the potential reward outweighs the potential risk. Plus, it’s more exciting and gives you bragging rights if you succeed on your own."

2021-06-14 22:46:41,stocks,Gambler’s Fallacy
2021-06-15 08:44:52,stocks,"There are many factors to think about when choosing to invest passively in ETF or actively by picking your own stocks, there is no right or wrong choice:

* time and dedication - full time job or college student? family duties? Professional investor/ trader?
* risk tolerance - college fund, retirement account etc, or money you don’t care if lost.
* your own personality - do you like risk or fear risk? Do you find ETFs boring and wants the challenge to beat them? Do you like learning new things everyday?
* purpose for investing: Are you young and you want to grow wealth aggressively or you retired and want to preserve it as long as possible while you live off of it, or saving up for mortgage deposit?
* investing time horizon - years? months? days?

ETF is a low risk and passive way to invest. You just put in certain amount of money every month and forget about it. Over long period of time it will guarantee to make good returns without too much risk and volatility.

On the other hand, stock picking requires dedication and many people lose money and underperforms ETF, especially newbies investors. However the upside is unlimited so is the ability to take on unlimited risk with options/leverage which leads to catastrophic losses. In r/wallstreetbets you can see many people on both side of the fence: ones who have made 6-7 figures profits in a few months and those who have lost similar amounts on option YOLOs.

There is no rule that says your must do one or the other. You can definitely learn to be a good active investor if you can put in enough time and effort. However if you are a newbie you should put 90% of money in ETF and use only 10% to play with until you become consistently profitable. The expectation is that someone will take one or two years to become good so that’s also something to consider."

And you can justify it by saying you're a responsible investor."
2021-06-15 04:00:37,stocks,"I'm pretty sure the number is actually higher than 80-90%, I remember anything of 92-98% depending on the year.

If you draw a scale of risk from 1 to 10, where would YOU put normal stocks? Stocks is a difficult term because it includes those at the top (usually value but not always), the growth stocks and let's just call the rest small cap. It's not accurate but close enough to be used.

Technically speaking the market works against you if you do what most people do and work in percentages. Let's say you make a 50% gain and a 50% loss repeatedly - or in other words you just flip a coin. It might seem like investing into stocks is more favorable than that, but considering you might have the lowest valued stock compared to company performance and no one buys it, that's just how the market is. It's people buying and selling, not an algorithm working and rewarding good research.

So with the 50% up and down

100, 150, 75, 112, 56, 84, 42, 63, 32, 48, 24, 36, 18, 27...

I think you get the point. Of course + and - 50% does not have the same value, but if you trade on the market you might see either quite frequently. And our brains work in 2 major ways regarding profits: take them way too early or way too late. This means you heavily miss out on when you should actually take them. This is easily said because who knows how long it goes up, but for a rough rule set a goal before investing and instantly sell there. Rarely change this. Most people just buy and then see what happens to decide what happens.

Same with losses. Mentality is also the same, either they sell way too quickly at a minor loss or they get too attached and see it come crash down. While this is easily a 90% for penny stocks, for larger companies that can be a 20-30% drop and it might take years to recover.

CFD is a beautiful verification of this behavior. 74-86% of all investors lose their money. Here in Europe they need a legal warning for this. This shows how much gambling is included in the nature of trading for most people. While CFD have interest included, that's not how people LOSE their money, they overgamble leverage because they again fail to see when they should sell or stop to buy.

Take the meme stocks for example. Someone wrote a comment on how people that think it crashes down should just short it and put money to their word. I said this is flawed logic to think like that, the risk is simply not worth it. It should be obvious that they are way beyond a proper evaluation right now and market history shows this will correct eventually. But no one knows when. If you shorted GME at 200$ then good luck, it went up to 350-500$ depending on your exchange (US I think it was 350, at German exchange it hit 500 and after crashed down). This means you face a ton of risk depending on how long it rallies up, and it crashing down to close to 30$ won't help you if you got margin called previously on its way up. But the person shows his mindset and lack of knowledge on trading - and how easily people lose money or fail to beat the market."
2021-06-15 06:19:02,stocks,Investing and trading are two very different things
2021-06-15 00:12:50,stocks,"I cant speak for everyone but here's my reasons for stockpicking....

1. There are some companies that I simply cannot support. I feel they are parasitic and short term and I feel like shit when I own a fund that has them.  Can I avoid every horrible corporate decision in each stock I own? No.  But I can make some small statement about the world I want by my choices.  And I like that.

2. Going the index route means I'm capped at whatever the market does.  I have 100 percent guarantee that I will slightly underperform the market as a whole and have zero chance at a large upside.  Kinda like how warren buffett hates bonds.  They're a guaranteed limit to your upside.
I want at least some small tiny chance of having an open ended upside.

3. The more people are in indexing the more the situation becomes a tail wag the dog anti price discovery separation from the fundamentals.  This has unintended statistical consequences to the market at large.  Each layer removed from the primary of pricing a single stock introduces a separation and some level of risk (seen or not seen).  In a complex system that is built on recursion (or as Soros terms ""reflexivity"") this is akin to a top heavy weightiness when it becomes larger than half the trading and does the OPPOSITE of it's original (good) intention. This is unfortunate but real."
2021-06-14 22:03:15,stocks,"Fund managers and investment institutions spend a lot of money marketing their value. In fact it's the only marketing you'll ever see. 

There is also the psychological effect of perceived value. Humans think something is worth more simply because it costs more."

2021-06-15 09:25:17,stocks,Because in general people think they are smarter than they actually are as an almost universal rule.  Everyone thinks they are in the 20% and of course only 1 in 5 actually is!
2021-06-15 10:20:56,stocks,"In the words of that Oracle most extraordinaire, index funds are a protection against ignorance. You don't know who's gonna win over the long term? Buy everyone, the winners will offset the losers by a small percentage every year on average. 

Whereas if you have that competitive edge to spot the winner of an industry, you will absolutely beat the market. 

That's where the game is. As Buffett once pointed out, the auto industry and the airline industry changed the world in a couple of decades. But just because someone bought into these great industries doesn't guarantee that they bought into a winner. It's incredibly hard to pick which companies will emerge as the heavyweight champions over the long term, and which reigning incumbents will plateau or even implode. But if you pick right, it's also immensely rewarding. 

Index funds can roughly double your money every ten years. But what put Berkshire on the map wasn't doubling over decades, it was 1000x, 10000x returns over decades. Because getting a slice of a great business at a good price will do that over the long term. 

Index funds lower risk but also reward. 

Individual stocks increase risk and also reward. 

There are many ways you can shift the odds to your favor to pick winners, the most important of which is putting in due diligence for all of your investments."
2021-06-15 10:42:43,stocks,"Because the regular investor spends 30 min browsing Reddit before plowing a few grands in a company (s)he barely knows. Try not to be average. 

But also mostly it's a fun intellectual process, which circles back to point A. If it bores you to dig deep or just don't want to spend hours and hours looking into stocks, buy indexes. If you'll regret underperforming in hindsight because you did not enjoy the process, buy indexes."

2021-06-15 10:06:41,stocks,"To be completely honest its knowing that if you hit a 10x bagger when you're young, you put it in an index fund and when your 50-60 its now a 100 bagger instead of only a 10 bagger inflation adjusted. I'm 19 and i have about 20k cad invested. Given standard market returns it would 10x when im 50 so i would have 200k. But if I find a good undervalued company and invest in it right before a catalyst that i predict will happen, it would 10x and i would have 200k at 19 so 2m at 50. If you're successful at doing that twice, you have 2m at 19 and 20m at 50. (Im not trying to convince any of this is sound reasoning, im just saying that you dont actually need a lot of 10x baggers to be crazy rich, and 10x baggers are everywhere these days so it gets you thinking, why would I pussy out and put 20k in the sp500 and forget about it and make not even enough to afford a house with that kind of cash)"

2021-06-15 11:56:39,stocks,"I certainly think it's a mix of reasons-- top upvoted comments of ""it's fun"" / wanting to be the ""other 10-20%"" are probably the 'best"" answers.

But realistically index funds outperform regular investors probably in the ""long term"" i.e. many years but sometimes I don't want to lock my money in for many years on end to see that return. In 5 years, I could gain more (or lose more) by going with individual stocks. So some people seek that volatility. I definitely think to someone that is extremely disinterested in stocks and doesnt enjoy investing should take advantage of index funds, but if you have some interest in it then having a mix is ideal just to expose you to some risk, it's fun, and keeps your mind stimulated so you don't do something stupid and go full yolo."

Individual stocks allow for much faster growth as well as deeper losses. It’s betting on specific company succeeding or failing vs betting on the world to keep turning. Index funds are good for parking money and preserving it but they are weak for making money. To actually make money by investing you to have to take riskier bets"

2021-06-14 23:27:05,stocks,"Because index funds do not outperform individual investors 80-90% of the time.  This is clearly either an impossible statistic or it is biased toward this strategy in some way.

Consider this thought experiment: if you put one dollar into a random market cap weighted list of SPY companies, there is a 50% chance that this dollar will outperform SPY.  So yes, the absolute lowest information thing you could do with your money (random chance) has a very good chance of beating an index fund.

So how would someone come up with this absurd statistic?  Well, if you look at individual investors entire portfolio which may include non-risk assets like bonds or cash, or if you measure day traders who will on average get leveled by fees...then yes this could be feasible that 80-90% of investors “lose alpha.”  But Jesus, I’m never going to be 100% invested in an index fund.  I’m always going to have some level of diversification into low risk assets. So I guess that makes me a loser??

So, this idea that stock picking is pointless because of some manufactured statistic about how “most stock pickers lose money LOL” is patently, demonstrably, and testably absurd.  Good stock picking is becoming even more important as the world move to more opportunities that favor “winner take most” type of structures."

I can say if I had 100k I'd absolutely invest in Index funds because I'd have a lot more to lose then, however the amount I invest would never have a good enough return in a quick enough time from an index fund but with individual stocks it is possible to gain a large amount or lose it all. So far I've been fortunate enough to invest in a few things that gave 50-100% return, I'm not arrogant enough to think I can sustain that sort of performance though, it's mostly luck."

If you pick stocks that do well you can always convert them back to index funds anwyays and you will have more money overall if it works out.

Also if everyone is index or passive investing then correct stock picks generate more returns because a majority of the crowd ISN’T picking stocks or finding alpha (making the alpha more valuable).

Also most stocks are directly tied to thr s and p index performance and tracked that way, just pick some that outperform over x time period and sell them back to buy the index .
Long term most companies go bankrupt and performance rlative to the s and p doesn’t matter if anyone one can go to zero (while 500+ or a basket of them are unlikely to all go bust)"

But honestly yall not being capable of understanding that much is great argument for indexing.

Do you want a bit more money? Buy an index fund.

Do you want the chance at life-changing money? *Don't* buy an index fund (because that will *never* get you there).

So if you have a bit of money that isn't doing anything for you regarding your lifestyle - even if it grows a bit in an index fund - then you might as well invest on your own. If you're fine with where you're at and you  just want a tiny bit more financial security then an index fund is fine.

There are a few reasons you'd want to go with individual stocks over an index fund or ETF, the most technical being that some stocks in an ETF aren't the best performing, or the best growing, and the ETF ""suffers"" from including that stock. Another reason is that an ETF may not give you the benefits in things like spinoffs, splits, or dividend increases.

Funds are vaguely safer, in that they're balanced for diversification of a sort and therefore one company taking a dive on a bad day won't wreck your whole balance. 

They're also less profitable because clearly if you'd put 10k in to Tesla in 2018 and 10k into any fund, your Tesla would have outpaced your funds by a whooooole lot.  And everyone thinks they can find the Tesla before it's known and make those giant gains."

2021-06-15 09:04:21,stocks,you would be surprised how many people actually do just use index funds. stocks I like to buy move 10% in a day where as the S&P averages that over long periods of time. Our way is just more risky and requires more attention but I love that because this is now what I do full time
2021-06-15 09:04:43,stocks,"Because depending on how little money you make, you'll be long dead before ever building up any meaningful amount of returns from index funds."

2021-06-15 09:17:46,stocks,"Well your right, it’s not fun. It takes all the work and effort out of making a return, which can be better for a lot of people. 

But the market only moves because someone’s trading, so someone needs to give coattails to ride on. And you also won’t know unless you try, I think people look to hard on beating the market, as if you need to aim for moon shots constantly. There are plenty of indicators to go by for finding a solid company for the short and long term if one puts in the work to find it. 

I also think the risk that comes with index’s are often overlooked too and often bank on past performance which is also one of the first lines of reasoning to why you won’t outperform. I mean you are bidding up the underlying essentially with no regards for the fundamentals. Money in the market now, at any price, is certainly a recipe for disaster with the right situation."

If you know what you're doing in the stock market it's not hard to beat those returns."
2021-06-15 09:40:37,stocks,"Its less risk, higher return if you know how to pick amazing companies at discount. Put your money in SPX at 44 PE today (37 shiller pe) when the historical average is 15-20, and the market over corrects so it usually drops below the median, so 44 to 10 is a rather large decline.

That’s because investing in index funds isn’t sexy so no one cares to share that they’re doing it. In reality, anyone with any amount of money in a 401k is invested in index funds, so the reality is almost everyone you know is doing it.

It’s the classic story of people only posting the craziest things about their lives on social media while withhold the boring stuff. The same thing happens with stocks"

As for the other 20%, if I have done some research and have a good feeling about some particular stock or small group of stocks (for example Zoom/DocuSign in early 2020 or GME/AMC this year) I'll put it in there. At the end of the day, the 20% is for gambling, which is fun :) The key is to manage your risk, not to eliminate it entirely."

2021-06-15 11:32:22,stocks,Because that’s where the big gains are. Majority of fund managers over time don’t bear the market but that doesn’t mean nobody else does. Warren Buffet wouldn’t be where he is if he just invested in the S&P 500.
2021-06-15 11:58:48,stocks,"As someone who works in the industry this is constantly preached among larger institutions. It would be interesting to see what they are comparing it too. If the comparison is to other money managers then I could see how this works since it’s a lot harder to be managing 100m+ accounts as you could end up moving markets. This is why I think hedge funds historically average around 20% and not much greater. I’m not a full believer in this as I have only been trading/investing for 3 years and significantly outpaced the market. I suppose the downside is where individual stock pickers get hurt the most. 50% downside means you need to capture 100% return just to break even. I could see how this theory would revert to the mean back around 07-08 more so than the past couple years. Interesting, nonetheless."
2021-06-15 12:03:59,stocks,Because everyone likes to think they are part of that special 10%.
2021-06-15 12:04:49,stocks,Index funds are like a 401k in that they are slow and steady gainers. It’s nice to invest in them and not have to dedicate time and energy to moving your money around.  But if you know what you’re doing you can outperform them most of the time - problem is most people don’t know what they’re doing and are more emotional than they should be with their portfolio.

I fired him and started doing it all myself, using a mostly buy and hold approach. In 2020, I got tired of doing dumb things like holding DAL into the Covid plunge, and started to learn to read charts, understand moving averages and RSI and MACD and understand why financials would underperform in this kind of environment while small cap value would do better in that kind. In the end...I know a lot more, I feel more in control, I might even enjoy investing more...but I'm underperforming what I'd have if I just bought VTI."

2021-06-15 13:00:52,stocks,"I think it’s more the strategy than the holdings. People that buy index funds are on autopilot. They buy and hold the same fund for decades. It removes all emotion. Buying individual stocks on the other hand, tends to have people questioning their decisions and leads to poor choices. I can’t tell you how many times I bought into a stock I believed in, watched it do nothing for six months or more and said fuck it and sold, only to watch it moon afterwards. I owned SQ at 14$, Tesla at 30$, Match group at 17$ etc and sold all of it before ever seeing any real gains. Had I held I would’ve realized massive gains over the next 5 years…

That’s the REAL reason index funds outperform people. They remove guess work and emotion."

2021-06-15 15:58:14,stocks,"Common misconception:

Active funds *after fees* fail to outperform passive index funds.

The reason for this is because the fund managers don't want to beat the S&P by too much, or even at all. Beating the S&P by too much would imply high volatility and risk..... Their job is to keep money in the fund, beat the S&P before fees *just enough* to continue to collect those fat fees, and fund their beach house.

Many retail investors can put together a portfolio aping certain active funds, and because they aren't paying extraordinary fees, can easily beat the S&P."

2021-06-15 17:46:02,stocks,Why do people gamble if you are more likely to lose?
2021-06-15 17:51:40,stocks,"More than a few reasons:

1) Cutting out the middle man (index management)
2) The ability to trade options
3) Potential to quickly rebalance for spikes and massive gains (chasing the dragon)
4) Shareholder voting rights
5) Pre-market trading per position / rebalancing 
6) If you really like a specific company and want to give them your support, you can't guarantee this with fund management

Example: If you were trading ARK indexes, and you see that TSLA regularly outperforms their positions alone and you could have had 100% more gains, you might think it easy enough to just buy the same stocks they bought, cut out the middle man fees, balance as you see for in your own brokerage account, get to vote your shares, and reap all the benefits if they do well."

I pulled my vanguard funds and bought space and other shares at $14 now it’s over double. 
Index is for those who want to set and forget it and have little experience in the markets or investing in general.

And if it takes effort, it means there are fees involve, which often eat up most of the gains. If a strategy is good, people dogpile onto it until it's overwhelmed and no longer good anyway.

The real answer is that there are strategies that are better, but they're not better forever. The indices are an evolutionary selection mechanism, companies make it there because they're good and reputable and generally have the momentum to keep going. More active strategies won't work forever, so there's an element of luck of knowing when a strategy has been overwhelmed by other traders or invalidated by changes in the market."

2021-06-15 18:49:58,stocks,"I think reading reddit stock subs would have you believe a lot of people beat indexes, especially the last few years.  A few things I know to be true:

* People don't post their wins as often as their loses
* Reddit is a poor representation of how most people invest.
* The stats that show its hard to beat the indexes consider the performance of the trader over a long time period.  What usually happens is, the longer we are in a bull market, the more retail traders enter.  They all think they are geniuses because they are beating the boring indexes.  Then a market correction happens, they get hosed, retail traders exit because a lot of them were playing with money they really shouldn't have speculated with, and the whole cycle repeats.
* Tons of people pour money into index funds, if you are not seeing it you are standing from a place with a poor view.  Most employer 401k plans would have a portion of your paycheck going to index funds.  The usual scenario in the professional world is your employer matches your 401k contribution up to 3%, meaning if you contribute 3% of your you get 6% of the value of your paycheck put into the 401k but only 3% taken out.  So 3% is usually the minimum people contribute from their checks because otherwise you a losing out on free money.  Additionally, you don't have to pay income tax on the first $19,500 of 401k contributions, so most people that are able to max that out every year do so."
2021-06-15 18:50:19,stocks,Plenty of people investing in index funds.  They just aren’t talking about how much money they are losing.
2021-06-15 19:14:30,stocks,"Well if you can’t beat the index, then yes you may as well throw your money into a fund/ETF. I track each trade I make against the S&P to benchmark. I’m averaging a +25% return above the S&P with a median of +7% (buy-n-hold strategy over ~2 years/~200 trades). If these metrics were consistently zero or negative, I’d throw my capital in VOO and move on with my life. Not to be confused with my alternate account which is for gambling/entertainment purposes"
2021-06-15 19:26:59,stocks,I think one way to look at this is that index fund can build wealth over a long period of time. Individual stocks can make you rich in a much faster time frame but at the same time you can loose that money quickly as well…Kinda like playing blackjack :/

We lose because of 3 things: 1. Illegal market activity (insider trading, naked shorts, etc) 2. Incorrect assumptions on our part 3. Unknown or unforeseen events take place."

In investing added risk should yield added expected return, or else it is called an uncompensated risk (which we want to avoid). Investing in individual stocks is an uncompensated risk and therefore is absolutely a worse investment than index funds, since it reduces diversification.

If you want more risk than index funds provide, you should look at other ways to increase risk like leverage.

Index funds really haven't been around that long and I'd argue that we have yet to see what their true risks really are.  While statistically nobody can ""beat"" the market as an individual, the whole system is predicated on the assumption that everyone is TRYING to do that.  When a majority is NOT trying to do that, the risks change. If we are still using the old risk model on top of the new paradigm then it seems we are in for a ride.  This is how black swan events are introduced into a system.... If every thing is priced on the assumption that it's a normal bell curve (Brownian motion with every body acting independently), when in fact it's a fat tailed curve (indexing and options) then the models will not be able to price in the correct risk.

If an index fund rises then it’s NAV rises which means any individuals who invested in the top 50% of that funds companies outperform the index. It’s not that almost no one outperforms funds. Is that almost no one has the patience to sit and hold their individual investments. This is not an ability issue it is a behavioral issue. 

A study of Fidelity brokerage accounts shows that its top performing clients were those that died and didn’t have their accounts closed for one reason or another. Second best performance was those that forgot their password. Nothing to do with funds, just patience. People are plenty capable of picking winners. Tesla alone has me so far ahead of market gains that I would need to lose money for years for index funds to catch me from a percentage gain perspective.

Yeah the main benefit of index is consistant gains over time and theoretically no losses (averaged out of long term investment won’t go to zero)

The individual stock has more risk (and trends to zero over time) but higher rewards and anyone buying them is playing a shorter term game.

People with low starting balances may do better to go riskier then de risk as balance grows since you can risk low amounts to make more and regrow the contribution amount quickly."

2021-06-15 14:47:02,stocks,"That math still doesn’t pan out. 

Unless you are getting older and can’t take near-term losses, then you would still be better off investing in an index fund. So what if a hedge fund provides consistent 5% returns year after year? If the S&P is giving you 10-15% annualized over 15-30 years, then you are still getting boned if you use a hedge fund. Plus, the fees are absurd. A run of the mill hedge fund is going to hit you with a 2% AUM fee and snatch  20% of your returns in excess of a fixed amount. Using your 5% figure, that gets cut to 3% right off the bat. On the off chance they do really well one year, they are going to take even more money. If you are looking for a more stable investment with lower returns, there are plenty of other investment vehicles available that won’t take out a huge chunk in fees. 

Hedge funds are crap investments and I’m not exactly in poor company in saying that. Many of America’s top economic and financial minds agree that indexed funds are better. The only people I hear saying the reverse are, you guessed it, hedge fund guys."

2021-06-15 02:44:57,stocks,"One incorrect statement. Higher risk does not equal higher returns for individual stocks. Higher risk DOES correlate with higher returns for portfolios though.

Stocks have two types of risk. Systematic and idiosyncratic. 

 The first is the risk shared by ALL stocks (market forces, the state of the economy, war in the near future) and the second is risk specific to each company (a potential change in leadership, new business model, threats from competitors, etc) 

By diversifying you reduce idiosyncratic risk, potentially to zero, leaving you with only systematic risk. That is the benefit of having a wide ranging portfolio or investing in an index fund."

Yes, diversification doesn't decrease average expected return. But you also decrease dispersion, which means you decrease your potential maximum return. This is what the original comment is pointing out. If you need to make a lot of money fast or you die, index funds won't get you there. Individual stocks can get you there, but probably won't. Can is still better than won't."

Instead, if you were to invest that in an ETF offered by a hedge fund that essentially guarantees 5% returns, then you guarantee yourself a $500k salary each year, in a very low risk environment, and you're still left with the $10 million you put in for next year. You will also pay far less in taxes each year, due to long term CGT rates."

When creating a portfolio we diversify our holdings by having many different stocks. Our portfolio has an expected return, a variance, and a standard deviation as well! 

When we look at all our stocks and compare them to our portfolio we can normalize the distribution by setting the mean = expected return of the portfolio. This means that the stocks will follow a normal distribution centered around our mean.

2021-06-15 09:25:49,stocks,"This statement is not entirely correct. Higher risk can equal higher expected return for individual stocks. If a company is small and there is a low chance of their success, but if they do succeed they could grow to a huge company, this is a very risky investment. If priced efficiently this stock should yield higher expected return since it is increasing systematic risk. This is what's called the small-cap premium (since small cap stocks are riskier investments they yield higher return on average). Large cap has been on a run lately so it's hard to see, but the small cap premium still exists."

Your stats aren’t incorrect they are just being interpreted wrong. Index funds show safe return rates due to human behavior, not because the market is collectively smarter or better. An investment in a total index funds is an investment in to an entire market and will safely go up over time in a country like the US. That proves to be the best investment method for the average person because the average person doesn’t have the information necessary to make informed decisions on thousands of companies. However, the average person often has advantages over professional investors or index funds within their area of expertise. If we can reach retail investors to invest in what they know, while maintaining conviction. It is quite easy to do better than average with average being something like VTI. 

The 80-90% rule is one of those “technically accurate but highly misleading statistics.” That number was also coined in the 90’s. I have not seen any updates to that statistic in decades even with the increase of social media, investment education, etc. I’m curious what it is after the craziness that was 2020 and all anyone had to do was buy and hold, and you likely doubled or tripled your money."

CEO pay is mostly in bonuses and stock options. It’s a different type of job then what I’m saying here.

I’m saying that being an employee is not going to put anybody into the 1%.  

Most large company CEOs are from the 1% and normal people can’t expect realistically to get those jobs.  You can strive for it but in the end you’re most likely to end up somewhere in middle management, maybe a low level executive.  Those salaries are not putting anyone into the 1% and nit picking about blue blood CEOs who are a rare exception to the rule is just a distraction from the overall thrust of the point that working for people generally doesn’t make you very rich.  I feel like this is common sense…

The most likely way to that kind of money is largely to just be born into it, at the end of the day.  I don’t say that in judgment just truth. I’m not saying you can’t beat the odds but most people die in the economic bracket they’re born into. Sometimes through no fault of their own. Life just does that sometimes.

Guaranteeing the safety of the shares sold is hitting the nail on the head. Exactly the point. Once you have withdrawn your initial investment plus some, you have achieved the goal of the trade, which was to profit. Level complete, on to the bonus round.

Exposing to more risk in another investment is basic understanding of stock market. The goal is to protect the profits of a SINGLE trade, not all trades. Once you open a new position, that's a new game, and the profit/loss exits reset anew.

Percentages of portfolios are for long-term investees who don't actively manage their holdings. Active traders trade by different rules. In fact, if an active trader tried to trade short-medium with long-term rules, he'd go bust in no time.

From then on, I played the OG game and it didn't matter to me if I liked it or not because I essentially got it for free. 

I didn't like it. But I didn't feel bad about it. I shrugged my shoulders and went about my life. 

That may not be the best analogy, but that's how it feels when I get my initial investment out. Everything from then on is just gravy. Sure, I'd like a ""real"" profit, but I'm gambling. I don't ""need"" the money for basic living. It'd just be nice to hit it big.

But while I’d say I don’t think this is the next apple or chipotle I think this stock has a lot to grow (pun). In my crappy spread sheet I think it’s going to go to about 8 in 365. Good earnings, good market growth and need, and geopolitical things such as legalizing of weed with strict thc content. Anyone smarter then me have ideas before this stock takes up over 25% of my portfolio."

If I was playing devils advocate (still bullish on CLF but waiting for value to come back on it) I’d say market has been pricing these trades for 6 months due to Dems and inflation concerns. That being said, I think materials still have 3-6 mo the left before they come back to earth. Will CLF stay at current levels? Idk. Is it undervalued? Yes, but trends suggest value is much lower than current level. Around $18-20 seems to be the sweet spot until next earnings.

2021-06-15 00:00:00,stocks,"Dow Jones or S&P 500 ETF? I have the majority of my portfolio in QQQ. The performance of QQQ has been amazing over the last year, and with the Nasdaq hitting new highs I've been satisfied with the returns thus far. Still, I know that piling all your money into one sector may backfire, especially with said sector being tech, with the Covid reopening underway. I've been eyeing DIA and SPY lately, and I'd like to invest a significant portion of my QQQ holdings in one of these index funds. The S&P seems to be a better choice; more diversified than the Dow, along with superior performance as of late. But there's also quite a bit of crossover between the Nasdaq and S&P's holdings, while the Dow is mostly in its own world. Given the economic outlook of the next few years, the potential for the Fed to increase interest rates in response to inflation, and the companies projected to benefit from the Covid reopening, which market index would be better between the Dow and the S&P? Investing outlook is about 2 years, after which I'd want to reassess. Cheers"

2021-06-14 21:18:20,stocks,"Dow is just marketing hype... Constant changes to members to keep it moving up. 

S&P, also, but far less dependent on manipulation.

2021-06-14 20:52:59,stocks,"Dow is trash. No one benchmarks the Dow. 


If you're looking for diversification away from tech, look at industry ETFs. Or just start pumping money into broad market funds indexed to an S&P or Russell index."

2021-06-15 00:00:00,stocks,"Does Netflix feel like a ticking time bomb to anyone else? So first off I want to preface this with I'm new to investing, so if I'm just horribly wrong in what I've thought through, please tell me and I'll be on my merry way, but to me Netflix feels like like a ticking time bomb.

It feels like a lot of articles about Netflix being either a steady stock or a stock that will increase pretty well in the next few years, practically taking it from other companies, mostly cable as people are ""cutting the cord"". I feel like that was the right way to think about it a few years ago, but not now.

Practically any company that has things to watch is making a streaming service, and thats where netflix fails. They don't own any of FOX, Disney, and streaming services like Amazon Prime has practically an infinite windfall behind them to keep them ahead, as we saw with their recent MGM purchase.

And now that everyone has a streaming service, Netflix is losing a lot of their shows it feels. They've lost their most popular one to Peacock, and their own originals don't seem to be blowing up consistently like they did in the Stranger Things era when they had The Office along with many other shows.

So with all this, is it a time bomb? Would it be good to short it in the near or somewhat near future? Or even would it be good to buy now and then sell before the it crashes if it will?

EDIT AS I WOKE UP AND READ COMMENTS: Yeah... shorting is probably not gonna be the road for me haha, but I've learned a lot and I'm extremely appreciative of every comment, even the ones where I'm called kinda dumb for asking about shorts 😅"
2021-06-14 22:09:07,stocks,Short shitty companies at your own risk. Short FAANG stocks at your own peril.
2021-06-14 21:08:01,stocks,Shorting is not really something that someone “new to investing” should be involved in.
2021-06-14 20:08:14,stocks,"If you don't think Netflix will thrive, relative to their competition, then don't short Netflix. Invest in Netflix's competition."

2021-06-14 22:52:01,stocks,No. Please don’t short if you’re new to investing man you could lose a ton of money
2021-06-15 00:26:29,stocks,Short NFLX. Get your market tuition paid early.
2021-06-14 22:53:40,stocks,A lot of investors think Netflix is in trouble.  So that has resulted in the stock getting oversold.  The revenue and EPS are still moving upward.  I'd start to worry about Netflix if the subscriber numbers drop below the nice round number of 200 million.  But it looks like the stock price could correct back up to around $550 once people see it as oversold.
2021-06-14 22:09:08,stocks,"I know from working a bit for Netflix shows that they blow money on productions like Ive never seen in the tv world , just during the pandemic their costs skyrocketing and they kept cranking out shows. And then there’s the 300 million deal with Ryan Murphy which was a total disaster as far as the viewership and quality of the shows he put on there , millions more to letterman and chapelle, paying directors 400,000 an episode and on and on , I don’t see how that can be sustained."

2021-06-14 23:29:25,stocks,"Been seeing these kinda posts for years. About Netflix. Amazon. Apple. Microsoft. These companies aren’t going anywhere because some people don’t like/use their products. That will always be the case, what matters is long term growth and the offering of a product that keeps iterating positively. Not to mention growth in foreign markets outside of the US…which people seem to forget is a thing."
2021-06-14 20:15:22,stocks,"I agree with you, netflix is getting in a more mature stage and growth expectations will get tempered in the next decade probably gonna see some consolidation and failures with streaming services. In any case there is way better valuation available right now in the market"
2021-06-14 22:32:17,stocks,Netflix is a cash machine that continues to grow internationally and add subscribers every month. They have better AI than all their competition as well.
2021-06-14 20:33:01,stocks,"Nah you’re not the only one. This is basically the bear case for Netflix. I’m on this side tho, which is why I’m not interested in NFLX. Maybe you might want to invest in something like ROKU to capitalise on the streaming wars since they’re basically platform neutral meaning regardless of which content producer ‘wins’ the streaming wars, they’re likely to profit."
2021-06-14 22:49:32,stocks,No its not
2021-06-15 06:31:21,stocks,"Every time I try to pick up a different streaming service I create a new account for a free trial of the new service ie: hulu, Prime, dis+, hbo etc and end up binge watching everything I’d care to see before the trial period is up.

All the other streaming services that claim to have great content really only have a few shows, then overpriced disappointment. Or they charge more on top of the sub for “newer content”, see recent theater releases on streaming services.

At $70/month for hulu+live tv, that’s $840/year for “commercial free” tv that still has commercials…

Then in the end I go back to Netflix. <$15/month <$200/year. Actively creating tons of new content. Best of all, no commercials.

Netflix has the best business model….. for the customer…. Whether or not that will allow them to topple giants like hbo/dis remains to be seen."
2021-06-14 23:35:39,stocks,"You’re only looking at this through your own view and judging content based on your opinions. As you’re new to investing, the most important lesson to learn is being able to separate your own judgment and the market’s. 

I’m not a Netflix owner/bull but their overseas growth is incredibly impressive. They’re growing rapidly in markets that others haven’t even started to tap into."
2021-06-14 20:30:00,stocks,"I mean personally yeah I have my Disney,HBO etc niches. But Netflix has some pretty damn good OG originals to where I’ll never stop paying. Also their movie and show licensing selection is great to IMO ."

2021-06-14 23:21:48,stocks,"No offense but a lot of new investors have ideas like this and they are 99% going to be wrong. 

They try to rationalize the market as common sense which doesn't work as everyone else already knows what you know and don't care or there is another factor involved"
2021-06-14 21:59:48,stocks,"I hear what your saying, but the reason you see less bought content on Netflix is because they have invested in making their own and it seems to be a better roi than renting content. I totally agree that there will be consolidation in the stream service area, but see it is more likey that the hbo max and discovery of the world will fail not netflix, they just have less content that people actually want to watch. Now is netflix overpriced probably, but what technology, that has a chance of really growing, isn’t overpriced. This is not investing advice."
2021-06-14 22:18:08,stocks,They are trying to add games by 2022. That will probably send them up again for a while. I would add the link but not sure how to do it right n don't want to get deleted
2021-06-14 20:11:07,stocks,Netflix has a *lot* of data and knows exactly what consumers want to watch. They’re much more than a company that licences content and then streams it to customers.
2021-06-14 23:11:43,stocks,"No. Just you. I swear to god i saw this kind of thread about netflix every 6 months. It's not going to blew up, it's not going anywhere, and they just started expanding to movie sector. Covid also help making people realize they don't need to go to movie theatre to watch new high quality movie and this can become permanent in the future."
2021-06-14 23:33:12,stocks,Your thought process that Netflix’s days of high growth are over could be right. I tend to agree with it (not that my opinion holds weight). But even if you’re right Netflix might still hold its value. I don’t see Netflix having a decrease in revenue or profit just a decrease in growth. And that gives the stock two opportunities. 1. Recognize that it is priced for high growth and fall in price to lower growth expectations. Or 2. Trade sideways for a long time until it slowly grows into an appropriate valuation. Because there are three possibilities (those two and the possibility your wrong). I would avoid betting on a downfall. I’d look for a company I believe is a better value for my projected growth.
2021-06-14 23:42:07,stocks,I think Netflix main strategy is to buy up all the content and they have the money to do it. As long as they nab a hit or two a year they’ll make a hefty profit. They have been buying tons of stuff from film festivals and they out bid major studios. I would not bet against Netflix.
2021-06-15 00:11:17,stocks,I don't know man...but their number are pretty high up there in terms of subscriptions.
2021-06-15 01:24:48,stocks,you have absolutely no access to any information that would lead you to a conclusion that netflix will do so poorly that it's worth shorting
2021-06-15 02:07:52,stocks,"Your thesis is correct but the problem is you are focusing too much on what you see in America. People are still going to sub to Netflix even though it will be a slower rate in America. However, there is a huge untapped global market. Next time you log into Netflix see how many foreign shows are being added. They even have different catalogs for different countries. Until that market begins to slow down, I would not bet against Netflix. They recently even are contemplating getting into gaming as well as experimenting with a shop with merch on their properties. I’ll leave those for another day tho. Yes they missed expectations for subscribers this past quarter however the pandemic really did pull forward a lot of numbers. The underlying trend of growth is still intact. Saying you are thinking about shorting a company without knowing all the details is going to be a disaster. I advice you to further research the company on a global scale before you short the stock especially when you say you are new. Best of luck bro hope this helps shed some light on things you might not have considered.

Edit: do not own Netflix stock"
2021-06-15 03:55:54,stocks,Don‘t bet against a stock whose name has become part of everyday language. Just Netflix & chill!

2021-06-15 08:10:06,stocks,"dont short! thr thing abt markets, and it has become even more apparent now is that sometimes fundamentals matter less compared to sentiment, which can cause effects like gme and amc. if u short netflix, the possibility of blowing up your whole account is increased. if anything, when new, stay away from stocks you dont like. when u get more experienced u can learn options and buy puts, which limit ur losses unlike naked shorting. but im just a 18yo investor with 8 months of experience and just starting to learn options, so heres my 2 cents"
2021-06-15 10:24:38,stocks,Incredible Korean shows..  misaeng .. hotel del Luna ... so many incredible shows on Netflix
2021-06-15 10:44:08,stocks,"The advice you need is to focus on finding good companies and not to worry about bad ones. 

The reason for this is because the time element of put options or short selling. It’s a far more complicated bet as you have to get both the direction and timing correct. Of course it pays much better when you hit both of these correctly, but again, so much harder.

Most new investors get really engulfed by bad companies, just ignore them and buy good ones, for now."
2021-06-15 11:45:21,stocks,"I felt like Facebook was shitty because all I have in my mind is the social media page, but aside from it actually thriving and doing amazing they expanded heavily.

Ask me a week earlier, and I might have had the same view on Netflix and BAM they go into ECommerce. Signs like these are critical to see that a company is not just idling in hopes everything stays as it is, but they are moving. That doesn't always mean it's a great direction every time, but it means they will most likely hold their position."
2021-06-14 23:35:43,stocks,"There’s nothing on Netflix that is interesting to me anymore and they seem to spend a lot of money on their originals only for it to be canceled a season later. Like Jupiter Ascending.

They really should just buy popular shows like how Amazon bought the expanse"
2021-06-14 21:39:00,stocks,Short answer- no.
2021-06-14 23:12:01,stocks,"Netflix won't go anywhere unless it implodes itself. 

It's far from perfect of course. 

But for every cuties there's a Witcher.

For cancelling shows like Jupiter's Legacy, even when it's the most popular show across all streaming platforms at the time, there's a renewal such as Stranger Things. 

For every woke crap they try to shove down our throats there's a Kobra Kai. 

Not to mention it's incredibly cheap for what you get. Disney plus by comparison is a joke when it comes to new content. 

If anything every time Netflix fuck up they're basically giving you a dip buying opportunity."
2021-06-14 22:11:20,stocks,"I agree, Netflix used to have a moat, now it has none"
2021-06-14 20:52:49,stocks,I think the term for this is that they lost their moat and are not as insulated from competition. I generally do agree - I don't think they're going away anytime soon but I also think that their growth is going to be shot compared to the past decade
2021-06-14 20:52:53,stocks,"I think they will be around for a long time. But they won’t grow like they were growing anymore. I think the stock price will keep trading sideways for a long time. 
They are almost saturated in US market although they are investing a lot to increase their international experience but It’s tough to compete with local competitors."
2021-06-14 22:03:01,stocks,It's a stay-at-home stock. I don't see it Going higher It might start to trend down Since the economy is back open and a lot of people are starting to go to work. I am barish On it. Same with the marijuana stocks. But that's just my opinion I may be wrong do your own DD.
2021-06-14 22:27:46,stocks,Yes.  I chose to invest in Disney because of this.
2021-06-14 23:05:52,stocks,"Yes, but speaking from experience it will probably take a lot longer than you expect"
2021-06-14 23:14:23,stocks,"I wouldn’t count them out yet. I remember when they mailed dvds, thought it was dumb. Then I remember when they stopped mailing dvds.. I thought that was dumb too."
2021-06-14 23:16:41,stocks,You can buy puts or you can invest in competitors easily and not be open to infinite losses. Shorting stock isn't something you should get in a habit of doing.
2021-06-14 23:18:26,stocks,NFLX financial statements are a shit show. However it’s not going anywhere until Disney starts consolidating competitors. First to market is sometimes an interesting advantage that’s hard to overcome
2021-06-14 23:22:15,stocks,"I agree with the broad strokes of this, which is why I have no interest in NFLX. I'm also skeptical of any stock for a company that sells things no one actually needs because I don't understand what makes such a stock move. 

Problem with shorting is you don't know when it's gonna fall. it's not like going long, where you can just wait forever for it to go up. Short is essentially a time-limited leveraged investment because you need to borrow that stock and short it by a certain time. And I'm pretty sure retail investors can't naked short. On top of that you are exposed to infinite risk, because the price can go up to infinity. 

If you think the price will fall, you can buy put options. But even then you still need to know when and how far you think the price will fall. However your risk is limited to 100% of the price + option premium."
2021-06-15 00:52:14,stocks,"Like other people said, shorting is tremendously risky. It's something only reserved for hedge funds and other institutions that have teams of analysts feeding them information faster than humanely possible for anyone else. Even for the hedgies, they don't short stock because they think ""oh netflix is overvalued, I think it will go down"" they do it because they know for a fact that it will go down, via insider or regular info. 

So basically, if you found out that there was some really bad news about to released on Netflix that nobody else knew about yet, then maybe, MAYBE, you could consider shorting it. But all the things you said about Netflix, well, it's been going down for a while now, so it's probably already priced in. 

As other's mentioned, you can also buy puts, but honestly, I wouldn't touch any of that unless you are the type who sits there and looks at spread sheets and numbers about their stocks for hours a day. The fact is, for us average joe's, we have no idea what stocks are going to do in the short term. But what we can do a decent job of finding good long term plays with a little bit of research and intuition. So if you think Netflix is going down the toilet, maybe find a better streaming company that will grow instead and buy it?"
2021-06-15 01:12:18,stocks,"Netflix is still super dominant. I don't spend any time on any other streaming service or know anyone else who does. For example, I didn't even know Apple had a streaming service and they spent the most $ out of all the companies last year to produce original shows. Yes there is a boom of streaming services and there will definitely be a bust because after a while people are going to get tired of signing up for a new service for every new show. I am 98% positive Netflix will still be here in 10-20 years. I can't say the same for any other streaming service. So no I do not think Netflix is a ticking time bomb"
2021-06-15 01:25:21,stocks,"With shorting, you mean buying puts, sure - consider that. 

But given that you’re new to investing, do not short by selling calls, your losses could be infinite, theoretically.

2021-06-15 01:54:41,stocks,"I dont own any NFLX

Here is my opinion. Its probably time to put to rest the idea that any platform will dominate. It wont. I think we need to start talking about them like they are ""tv channels"" not like ""cable providers.""

Think back to the days when we had only 10-20 channels on tv. Later, we had 200-300. Did the new channels hurt the old ones? The answer is, not really. What hurt them was their own programming, not someone elses.

The other providers wont slow them because none of them will provide enough new content on their own to keep people satisfied regardless. I mean seriously... even if Netflix suddenly had 10 big hit shows, that barely 120-200 hours a year of content. Pretty sure people spend more than 2-4 hours a week on tv... they will need more than 1 content provider and who has 10 shows worth watching? LoL.

So forget competition.

Does Netflix have enough exclusive content to hold and gain new customers at $9-$14/mo? I would say yes. For me its Witcher, Umbrella Academy and Stranger Things.

Is their stock priced high? Well I dont own any for a reason...

yea I think its a bit too high because I am not really sure how many more subs hey can actually get. So given their high PE, I dont want to be stuck with a company that may very well hit their cap in a 2-3 years. The PE will likely still be 30 or so on current basis so to me, thats not so great. They will need to start raising prices to keep the rev growth going up which is fine but it will likely decay to 15 PE pretty quickly from there. Pass for now. Id rather hold Amazon because they have more avenues of growth as crazy as that sounds. Then again, maybe sub growth will be much higher than that. Maybe they can get into China or maybe India skyrockets. Dunno. They might have capped the USA and other English speaking nations but no idea about the others."

2021-06-15 03:42:00,stocks,"Netflix has significant advantages in software, international growth and support, and custom content. While other companies have been sleeping and sticking to old models, Netflix steadily grew its own content farm and became a big player in custom content, paying new and buzzing creators big payouts and building a reputation of creative freedom and quality similar to what HBO and AMC networks were able to build. In addition, Netflix has really found out the international game, creating quality custom content for other countries. The custom new content will only grow, with hits such as Stranger Things, Queen's Gambit, Tiger King, and Bridgerton. 

Netflix also has superior data tracking, allowing them to find out exactly what you like and gear content creation where the audience is better than any competition other than maybe Disney. Disney is limited by its brand however, and can't stray too far from the Disney principles, similar to how Nintendo can't stray too far from their style of content.   


Netflix is still the leader with over 200 million subscribers, Disney with over 100 million and HBO and Huly with only about 40 million. Other services straggle with far less than 40 million subscribers. Killer content like The Office isn't enough to combat this. By being an early player, with superior tech, Netflix is poised to be a market leader for years to come. In addition, other companies will find the costs of getting into the battle too high and they may fold. In order to compete with the established players, they have to offer a competing price point, which means they have a higher price for content per subscriber.   


I believe Netflix will continue to be able to produce content that can capture audiences, while the other companies to compete will have deep pockets like Amazon, Disney and Apple, and we may see some companies give up and realize licensing their content is the way to go to be profitable, instead of having to get into the business of technology which is an expensive business to run. Also, it's been shown that users have a higher threshold of acceptance for being subscribed to multiple services. Most people will probably have a combination of Netflix, Hulu, HBO and Disney and find this totally acceptable. I feel that shorting Netflix would be a foolish thing to do, as they are still in a long term trend of adding subscribers and while the trend is slowing, they show no signs of declining, even with competition.

Their deliberately opaque subscriber metrics.  Loss of crucially attractive content.  Their crazily irresponsible studio operation.  Their (probable) saturation in certain markets.  Their lack of ability to compete in the content spending arms race that they caused.  That they won't reveal how many subs are paying $15 and how many are paying $2.  The fact their many competitors (Apple, Disney, Facebook, Amazon, Google) can afford to burn money for decades longer than Netflix can.

Thankfully, I never tried to short Netflix though because if I would have, I would have started before the unexpected pandemic gave Netflix a boost and therefore that short would not have gone well for me.

Netflix also has powerful brand loyalty that is not logical. I've talked to so many people that just continue to mindlessly pay their Netflix subscription every month even when they don't have any new content to watch. And then I hear these people talk about how they would love to watch some other show but can't because it is not on Netflix so I suggest: ""Why don't you just cancel Netflix for a while and subscribe to the other streaming service that has the show that you really want to watch and then cancel that one after you are finished with their content and come back to Netflix once Netflix has more new content that you want to watch?"" and they then look at me like I'm speaking gibberish.

That kind of brand loyalty will take a while to break, so while I do think that the days of high growth for Netflix will be coming to an end and I still believe that Netflix stock will eventually start to go significantly downward, it is impossible to predict exactly how long that will take to happen so I would never short it.

They have begun churning out their own content like crazy and a lot of it is crap but a lot of it is also really good.

n
Not true. There are still companies that will license out content to whoever bids on them and don't have a streaming service. Even the companies that have streaming services will still license out content to Netflix. In fact, they will still even make shows for Netflix. In TV there's a a long history of companies making shows for other channels they don't own and that probably won't change any time soon. 

Amazon has a lot of cash, but it doesn't mean that they are going to consistently spend it all on Amazon Prime video. They have other endeavors too and companies like to hold on to cash. 


> And now that everyone has a streaming service, Netflix is losing a lot of their shows it feels. They've lost their most popular one to Peacock, and their own originals don't seem to be blowing up consistently like they did in the Stranger Things era when they had The Office along with many other shows.

Netflix is losing a lot of old shows that are popular but thy also replace them with other llicensed popular shows. But on top of that they are making lots of new shows. Netflix shows do not to blow up like stranger things in order to bring values to consumers. Netflix doesn't make more money by having the most watched shows. They make money by continuing to add value that people stay subscribed. And Netflix still makes popular content that trends or gets critical acclaim at least every months. But again that doesn't matter as long as you have people watching something. Whether it's all one show or spread across multiple shows; what matters is that they are subscribed.


One last thing to note is that streaming isn't a zero sum game. Amazon, Disney, etc. growiing doesn't mean Netflix has to blow up."

2021-06-14 20:19:47,stocks,"I feel like investing in their competition is a good path, but I seriously don't see Netflix thriving. If they keep losing their popular IP's I think they would be falling more than that"
2021-06-15 08:25:50,stocks,"I also don't support shorting as 100% is the best and infinity losses are theoretically potential.

However, Netflix is a 300B market cap and I can't see it rising to the point where OP would be down 300%. I would never short a great CEO like Reed Hastings. 

I don't own Netflix"
2021-06-15 00:29:34,stocks,"Ouch. Well they are still quite profitable despite that. Hopefully they can optimize costs and quality, learn from their mistakes."
2021-06-15 06:34:42,stocks,I mean the cost of production sky rocketed because of covid testing and creating a health / safety department. This will decrease at some point.
2021-06-15 10:18:18,stocks,"This.  I've said it for years.  The way Netflix runs their studio is crazy and utter destruction of money.  They wildly overpay and do nothing to select for value or quality.  Because they use other people's money, they do things that would have bankrupted any other studio a hundred times over.  

It used to be one flop could bury a studio.  They'd test and plan and pilot and test and predict.  Not Netflix.  Buy first, ask questions later... or never.  At some point, the laws of physics will kick in and Netflix will no longer be able to act like gravity is turned off."
2021-06-15 06:33:52,stocks,"One way is they pay people below the line less, they are cheap with independent shows they buy, the finance everything themselves, they use a lot of analytics and AI, they are getting into merch, they lure the top talent from traditional studios, they don’t pay vendors for shit, they throw money at prestige projects for branding not so much for content: this attracts above the line names as they get their freedom, they have one of the highest flying stocks of the last 10 years, they are the creator and leader of pure play streaming, they work the hell out of most and are not shy about cutting the cord, they attract and retain causing traditional studios a bit of brain drain, they collect silos of info on subscribers, ever hear of faang...should I go on?"
2021-06-15 00:17:41,stocks,"Mass unsubscriptions will bring their soaring giddy budgets down to earth. At some point, people will decide to go outside again"
2021-06-15 02:55:56,stocks,"They said they wated to disrupt cable, but what they really did was disrupt the production environment in every market they produce in.

Suddenly local networks are priced out of ther own markets because talent would rather wait for the ext Nflix gig than work what local can pay.

Fuck Netflix"

If I were Netflix I'd axe Bella Bajaria. All of the content this year are just trends. Nothing resonating with the audience."
2021-06-14 23:02:05,stocks,I think that overvalued-ness IS a Fox/Disney standing behind them producing content.
2021-06-15 00:23:04,stocks,The stock is fairly valued imo. It will stay here for the next few years atleast.
2021-06-15 09:10:39,stocks,You can make an argument that nearly every tech stock is overvalued right now but Netflix is close to being cash flow positive. That will lead to buybacks or possibly a dividend. That's a good outlook for shareholders.
2021-06-14 20:18:33,stocks,Yeah... I could've worded that better. As I said in the post im new at investing so I need to figure out not to say the obvious 😅
2021-06-14 23:04:38,stocks,"Absolutely, their analytics is very refined and it also has the best user interface out of all the streaming services."
2021-06-15 00:06:11,stocks,"But every time a new streaming service comes up or a series like The Office leaves they lose more of their moat. Apart from the original series they really don't offer much that you can't get elsewhere. I think as more and more people cut the cord and start picking up 4-5 streaming services they'll look to cut the fat on their subscription bills and Netflix might be on the chopping block for a lot of people that prefer shows that aren't on Netflix. Netflix isn't that expensive when it's your only streaming service on top of cable. But when you cut the cord and pick up a couple streaming apps, it becomes easier to justify canceling"
2021-06-15 10:50:49,stocks,And there are still parts of rural America who don’t have internet or the internet speeds to download Netflix. Growth can still be found.
2021-06-15 18:48:06,stocks,"Nothing to do with content. You can have the best tech and still tank at storytelling.

Disney+ just released WANDAVISION, LOKI, and FALCON AND THE WINTERSOLDIER, just THREE TV shows and look at their growth. It takes Netflix 100+ trial and errors just to get a measly quarterly net adds. That can't be good.

Just look at their desperation with Josh Duhamel's wig in JUPITER'S LEGACY. One look at that wig and it's an automatic cancellation."
2021-06-14 23:41:39,stocks,"Yeah, this is the bear case indeed. The bull case is they've invested heavily in their own IPs and are a force to reckon with in TV and movies regardless of what other networks do with their own content."
2021-06-14 21:00:46,stocks,"Roku is my favorite stock. Best stock in growth because they've already dominated the growth part, it's just their industry that will keep growing as rural and emerging countries gets broadband, cable cutting continues, etc."

I'm German, I keep Netflix because I love the Korean movies and series they have."
2021-06-14 20:30:27,stocks,Also like to add personal note we signed up for almost all the services at one point but after watching what we wanted we cut all of them except for Netflix and prime. Reason is Netflix has a lot of Netflix made foreign shows which we like. Something else to keep in theres a part of the market that thinks like that
2021-06-14 20:23:27,stocks,"Thanks for the comment! Very true, the brand loyalty to it is pretty big, I've had my subscription for years and feel like I'm using it less and less but I'm still paying despite the price increases :/"
2021-06-15 04:19:17,stocks,"If they're wrong 99% of the time, that means you can literally just do the opposite and make tons of money. There's no way the percentage is anywhere close to that much."

2021-06-15 10:25:44,stocks,"Everyone I know has Netflix and/or Amazon and then maybe the other services.  HBOMax and Disney+ are currently add-on services.  The biggest issue I see with them is they brought on their established catalogues, but their notable releases historically come out very infrequently.  A couple Marvel movies a year, a couple ""Disney"" movies a year... it adds up to not enough fresh content to sustain a subscriber base.  I have Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, HBOMax, and Disney+.

I have watched all the legacy content that is currently available on all of them that I find interesting.  The Marvel shows are the only saving grace for Disney+, without them I wouldn't have watched anything on there in the last two months, but I don't know how long they are going to keep cranking those out.  HBOMax is a constant battle about if I should cancel, at this point I only keep it because this year they are releasing movies straight to Max concurrent with theater releases, if that stops it will lose it's advantage and the production companies don't like that HBO is doing that.  Netflix and Amazon are the only streaming service that I can consistently find fresh content to watch all month long.  Until that changes, the others can't compete."
2021-06-15 14:21:05,stocks,There’s also been chatter for years that Netflix will purchase a theatre chain to premiere films in.
2021-06-15 10:10:07,stocks,"Plus the next season of Stranger Things which was delayed by the pandemic, also, Shadow and Bone was massively popular and was renewed for a second season.  They have an insane amount of good quality original IP, and if someone isn't aware of that they probably have never actually watched Netflix for more than old shows and movies.  If that is what someone thinks Netflix's value is, then I understand them thinking it will drop, but they have a massive production arm that has years of practice making good content that isn't available anywhere else."
2021-06-15 01:43:18,stocks,"Nah, they'll be around much longer. They're #1 in streaming and no company appears even close to taking that top spot. I also see Netflix becoming more interactive and not just offering tv or movies."

2021-06-15 02:31:04,stocks,The other fun part is that's TTM when movie theaters were closed and sports were getting delayed or cancelled. Covid was the best case scenario for Netflix and the worst case scenario for VIAC and they still pulled in about the same revenue (a bit more).
2021-06-15 10:48:19,stocks,"FAANG as an acronym exists for salaries. Microsoft does not pay as well as those companies.

2021-06-15 13:24:46,stocks,Depends as there's no right way of defining competition. Think about it this way. Netflix isn't just competing to be your main streaming provider. They are also competing for your leisure time.
2021-06-14 22:37:56,stocks,"Shorting a stock can be catastrophic, even if the analysis is correct. If the stock price falls a little bit later than anticipated, short sellers lose big.

On the other hand, if one believes a company is operating in a sector that is going to broadly be successful, but doesn't think that particular company is going to outperform its peers, it makes sense to invest in those peers. If Company A is going to underperform its sector, all other companies in the sector *must*, in the aggregate, have above average performance.

Are you suggesting you can't identify any of Netflix's competitors? Try Amazon, Apple, and Disney, to start.

Now, if we were talking about the buggy whip industry instead of the streaming industry, you'd have a great point, because the sector, as a whole, would not have great prospects."
2021-06-14 20:54:39,stocks,"I believe you're too late. The time to short tech stocks was in February, March, April, up untli its last earnings. You're going to short a namebrand company after it already took a correction due to lowered expectations they gave in late April? Bold strategy."

If they end up price warring each other into the ground they'll all lose.   But then with enough exclusive content there is pricing power for each.   I guess it comes down to quality content pipeline"
2021-06-14 23:29:21,stocks,"The risk in buying a stock is limited to your investment. The risk in shorting a stock is infinite. Just invest in the competition or a different sector. 

I agree with you. Netflix is ducked long term. It’s poorly managed and getting steamrolled by Disney among others. But timing is key to shorts. If you short a stock, you’re saying it’ll tank SOON - but Netflix is not doomed in the short term. They still have lots of subscribers and they aren’t leaving in droves. They can languish a long time before it tanks. And in that time, they could also fix the problems- and you are naive if you think they aren’t working on it. 

They could also get bought by a competitor, shooting the stock up 20%. 

There are lots of risks in shorts…."
2021-06-15 04:45:25,stocks,"The competition isn't ""outside"", it's other platforms with less of the bullshit (stop with the auto-play, stop recommending me things you just want me to watch, etc) and more of the content."

2021-06-15 10:29:20,stocks,"I believe the funding the content wars between companies like Netflix will be the focus of most Free Cash Flow until the winners are determined a decade or more from now, so I expect stock buybacks and dividends are a generation away.  I believe this is why Morningstar considers Netflix as 100% overvalued as the cost of the content war against all current and future competitors will alway limit profitability to low margin levels."

2021-06-15 00:27:26,stocks,"It's still the best streaming service right now. Their original content is quite good on average. I would honestly say Netflix has more shows I want to watch than HBO Now. It's also miles ahead of Amazon Prime in terms of content lineup. IMO, if people are picking 4-5 streaming services, Netflix is going to be at the top of the list of the ones to keep.

Unlike many tech companies, they are quite profitable, and as they keep gaining subscribers, they have more and more budget to produce content, and they get better and better at it because they have the right talent and expertise.

""In the first quarter of 2021, Netflix generated total revenue of over 7.16 billion U.S. dollars""

Just think, if they can produce movies for 10 to 50 million dollars a pop, how many movies could Netflix produce for a billion dollars? Probably about 20 to 50 per quarter."

Was a mini series and popular for about a month. Netflix is now roughly twice as expensive as the competition and they stand to lose a lot if T-Mobile decided to stop bundling it as part of their service.

Disney seems to be gaining big in mindshare, Warner Discovery is TBD but could be formidable if the debt doesn't limit them, and ViacomCBS appears to be rapidly growing too now. If Comcast ever get their heads out of their butts and spin-off NBCUniversal they could be formidable too (too many perverse incentives currently).

Netflix doesn't deserve to be treated as the only game in town anymore given the developments over the last couple of years."

2021-06-15 02:24:01,stocks,"And it's a great question too!

When a company does bad, like under performs bad (like Netflix), not corruption bad, then the stock goes sideways.  Sideways doesn't mean perfectly horizontal, but that it under performs the market, still often going up in the long run.

This is why you shouldn't short a company like Netflix.  Really what under performing says is it's probably not a good buy.

You short a company like Enron or Luckin Coffee or similar, one with an industry that is on its last leg but people don't realize it yet or a corruption scandal that you know to be true."

If you spend $1000 to short, you're theoretically risking far more than $1000"

2021-06-14 22:14:20,stocks,"Focusing on p/e is a common mistake made by many investors when it comes to newer growth stocks. Roku has a revenue growth rate of over 50%, a number which is currently accelerating. Their platform growth rate is 70-100% YoY, with 60%+ profit margins. 

When a company like Roku is teetering so close to profitability and has +50% YoY revenue growth their earnings potential can grow exponentially, especially since cost-reduction and efficiency is not a priority for them right now - growth is. 

This is also why Amazon had such a ridiculously high P/E in the past decade. They put all their earnings into growth and brand-building, avoiding billions in income taxes via R&D write-offs and re-investing those savings into growth. Anyone who thought Amazon was a money-losing business over the past decade never bothered to look at what Amazon was doing with their money."

Think about it this way, more than a 100% loss and the broker pays.  They have a very strong incentive to not let that happen.  Options trading is harder, because a larger than 100% loss can happen instantly at open and overnight volume can be too low to liquidate, so the broker doesn't have the ability to liquidate the trader ahead of time which is how options traders can and do lose over 100%."

2021-06-15 06:17:42,stocks,"How intimately do you know their company though?

Pre-pandemic I went to [Product School’s](https://productschool.com/product-management-events/) annual conference and the final keynote Speaker was from Netflix.

Firstly he actually came from Disney and knows quite a bit about the industry and finding iconoclastic media. But I also heard a bit about how they’re developing film maker software and the “Netflix Original” aren’t just familiar because of the stories they buy. They’re being piped through project management software, color, editing, that’s organic to Netflix.

Think about YouTube’s original content and how it can never graduate to consistent storied content.

And now think about how legacy media only knows how to squeeze water from ancient rocks (constant remakes and rereleases).

Netflix stands to be the frontier of story telling. They can sign talent cheap, churn out original content, and they mine user data like crazy unlike the disconnect sordid mess that Network research did to find out what people like.

The thumbnails for each show are tested against different markets and age groups. The average watch time. They can pull live viewing metrics on when a director and an actor are paired together.

My larger point is… none of that is public facing in any significant way. Unless you sold and shot a show on Netflix you wouldn’t think twice about how they’re making shows compared to how NBC does.

Maybe you can be bearish on the majority of the business, but if you believe in the tech (streaming entertainment) and the appetite for it it’s easy to forget that as a retail investor you’re probably missing a lot so picking one company over another isn’t really as simple as Marketwatch or Reddit threads make it."

Price shoots up, I hold because I want to wait for it to go a fair bit below $100 to buy back shares and close short positions. If the price shoots up from $100 to $200, The 10 shares that I shorted now costs $2000 to buy back instead of $1000. If the price shoots up from $200 to $300, the 10 shares shorted now costs $3000. The only limit to how much money it will cost for you to buy back the shares is how much people are willing to sell the stock for

2021-06-15 06:42:07,stocks,"That's all well and good, but popular content is what made Netflix the giant that it was. From my experience, the story goes that you heard about some Netflix original, so you subscribed to the platform, and then found that they had a lot of content that you knew and wanted to watch. The question could have been ""what's NOT on Netflix?"". Now, the question became ""what actually IS on Netflix?"". 

I'm bearish on all streaming platforms, because Netflix was a good reason for people to stop seeking out alternative means of access, such as piracy. You know, good service at a reasonable price. Now, if you want access to the same shows, you need 3 or 4 or 5 different service subscriptions, which is definitely not ""reasonably priced"" anymore.

As a result, people subscribe long enough to watch the original premiere or as soon as the show is out in full, and unsubscribe right after. They might as well sell it piecemeal, if it wasn't so bad for business optics. And so it seems to me that, much like cable, Netflix will stay relevant because of the B2B subscriptions that they have (hotels, ..) for a good while, but imo their growth days are over."
2021-06-15 18:39:35,stocks,"Everything you said here has nothing to do with content.

They're churning out the worst content it has seen in years. No tech is going to save them if their storytelling sucks and trying too hard.

2021-06-15 09:08:58,stocks,">they mine user data like crazy unlike the disconnect sordid mess that Network research did to find out what people like.

This is the often forgotten golden goose of Netflix. 

When it comes to buying, developing, and presenting original content to users, Netflix can dig into a very robust and granular data set that gives them an intimate view of what their users enjoy watching. The mainstream networks and studios don’t have access to that kind of information. The best they have are focus groups, which provide only a handful of very broad metrics, are rather expensive, and not guaranteed to be accurate. Compare that to Netflix, which collects data in real time and in about the most natural way possible with little added cost, and there’s simply no competition. 

That said, saturation of the streaming market does pose a problem for Netflix. With the way things are going, it’s easy to see a future where every major network has their own streaming service and keeps its content exclusive. Popular content from mainstream networks is a big draw for Netflix. It may prove rather difficult - not to mention expensive - to produce enough content, for enough people, with great enough frequency to keep the volume of paying customers that they currently have. That’s not to say that Netflix is doomed, but it certainly puts a squeeze on their potential growth. 

That said, I can see a few available avenues that Netflix can take to compensate for that squeeze. Number one is advertising. It’s practically non-existent in Netflix’s current business model and the aforementioned wealth of data they possess would allow them to charge a premium for highly targeted ad-space. How that could be implemented is another question. I think the most obvious way would be to create an additional discounted service teir that includes advertising, similar to how Hulu operates. Another potential area of growth is live TV. Given Netflix’s popularity with cord cutters, it seems only natural that they take further advantage of that and get into streaming live TV from mainstream networks. This presents not only an added revenue stream from subscription fees, but also the opportunity to sell better and more targeted advertising in a context where consumers already expect to see ads. Further down the road, given entry into live TV, there is also the opportunity for Netflix to partner more closely with the mainstream networks on advertising where they, with all their user data, could act as a sort of broker for live TV ad buys. These closer relationships could also present an avenue for Netflix to better maintain its stock of 3rd party content. 

One glaringly big problem with all of this: Netflix, in its own words, doesn’t want anything to do with it. Going so far as to compare themselves to HBO, they’ve stated clearly that they want content creation to be the driving force behind their business. With HBO being a privately held business, it’s hard to draw comparisons due to a lack of data, but with Netflix having over $25 billion in revenue and HBO having only a fraction of that, it’s a bit unsettling to see Netflix point to them as being an apt comparison for their business model. 

Long story short, I think Netflix’s content creation is great, but it can’t be the only thing that sustains them, not with their access to 3rd party content from mainstream networks dwindling. If they try to do that, then they’ll eventually just be another studio pumping out content. That scenario represents a contraction of their business, not growth. There are still plenty of opportunities for Netflix to take advantage of, it’s just a matter of wether or not they do."

2021-06-15 07:07:17,stocks,"It’s a good theory, in practice it isn’t true.

The biggest issue in the space isn’t users that cycle through streaming platforms trying to find good shows. It’s that the cost of the content is absurdly high to either maintain a license or develop original content.

They address that with: more users, higher prices, cutting down on shared accounts, and lowering production costs and writing longer deals for established content.

Your question is imagining utopic version of streaming that transcended licenses: unified all content to a singular platform, unlimited DVR capacity (playback), available for a rate of $8 a month with practically unlimited users AND devices. 

That was never going to happen. 

Instead of trying to make enough money to buy every primary leading IP from every studio Netflix went a different way. 

They produce content for you. It’s odd no, that there’s actually very little by way of promotion of lots of shows on Netflix but so many of the same type of people have heard of them.

Previously we’d all gather at the same time on the same night of the week to watch a show that has a chance to relate to us. It was scheduled around a generic idea of what your days were like: kids cartoons turned into soap operas that turned into news, then sports or prime time shows, followed by news and then nonsense.

Now a 30-40 year old is going be recommended 30 hours of television that’s essentially perfectly reflective of things you like in a film or tv show.

Also, at a certain point Netflix will eat up smaller studios and their IP. And at that point they’re the Whale not the big studios."
2021-06-15 12:19:48,stocks,"> imo their growth days are over

Well, first of all, I think that buying into Netflix right now will not result in the same kind of profit that you would have gotten buying into Netflix like four years ago. But that's really obvious.

Your point of view sounds more like the view of an unsatisfied consumer. ""I don't like Netflix any more because there are too many competitors so I'll just pirate whatever I want instead of paying""

Well, it isn't like that for a lot of consumers. A lot of people rely on these streaming services to tell them what to watch in the first place. It's more ""work"" to use google to find out what movie or TV show you might want to watch and then go pirate that thing . . . when Netflix tells you what you might want to watch and gives you the instant gratification of having it play right away"

I've read Idiot's Guide to Investing, books by Katsenelson (Little Book of Sideways Markets, Bogle (Little Book of Common Sense Investing), and Browne (Little Book of Value Investing), as well as the Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham, and I could use some guidance on how to construct a formula to calculate an actual price.

&#x200B;

It's difficult to be a good value investor if all I know is that a stock is good or not. I need to know what I consider an underpriced stock, fairly valued, or overpriced stock. So do you all have your own formulas? If so how did you come to it? Is there a general formula that most people starting out use? No matter how much I read it seems they all say something like ""you need to come up with your own formula"", but I have no idea how to do that even after all this reading. I'm definitely learning about the companies, I'm just not getting a sense of, for example, ""XYZ is overpriced currently at $12.55/share, but when it drops to $11.75/share I'll enter a position."""

Some companies own instead of lease, and when owning they typically depreciate the value every year.

The example I have in mind is Fred Meyers, ticker FMY, which was bought by Kroger years ago. There was a time when the Freddy's workers went on strike and I looked at it as an investment.

Freddy's was a 'one stop' grocery outfit, and surrounding the store was a bank, coffee shop, Taco stand, etc etc etc. Freddy's owned all the land. Hundreds of stores.

The 'average' land cost was booked at 150,000 after depreciation. But a lot of their expansion took place in the 70s and 80s. How much do you think an entire block in a busy area of town runs nowadays?

The stock was in the upper teens because of the strike. But I figured the land alone was worth $15-20 per share. It took 9 months before I sold in the low 40s."

In essence it says that market cap already accounts for cash and discounts for debt.

But then it doesn't subtract other assets or balance receivables and non-debt liabilities.

On the other side, when you calculate the DCF and multiply it by the multiplier, you then subtract the debt and add the cash before comparing to market cap. It just moves the debt and cash to the other side of the equation.

So the remaining bogey is the multiplier, which seems arbitrary. Applying the formula to a bunch of tickers should reveal whether it's too loose."

I'm fairly new to investing, but I've done some research on calls and puts and decided that I was going to buy my first calls today - because I believe I'm only going to learn by getting burned - and I think I burned myself. 

I bought calls today on three different stocks that expire 6/18, (4 days from now). All contracts that were already fairly close to the strike price. 

I never had any intention of exercising the calls and buying the underlying shares because I do not have the money for that. My intention was to resell the contracts when the stocks were ITM. 

Now I'm thinking - why would anybody buy my contract so close to expiration if it's barely in the money? 

One of the calls is already ITM, but only about 12 cents above the strike price. If I try to resell this contract, is there a logical reason to buy it with an expiration date in four days, or would I just be passing it on to the greater fool (if there is one) ?

Besides, it's 2021... most brokerages worth using have options modeling built in. They will tell you what the underlying needs to be at to break-even, and show the P/L diagrams at the expiry AND before expiry. Even if you're not familiar with the greeks, they should give you a pretty good idea how your trade is going to turn out, at various price points and various times until expiry.

The P/L diagrams at various dates before the expiry are definitely worth looking at, because you will then know that an option's ""moneyness"" has nothing to do with profitability.

Take a look at today's SPY movement, for example. The intraday range for SPY was $423.10 to $425.27. 

You could have bought an OTM call expiring this week with the strike price of $430 for 0.20 this morning, and sold it at 0.38 at  around 14:00, eventhough the underlying is still OTM. 

The position netted you 0.18 simply because it's now slightly more likely that the SPY would hit $430, than it was this morning."

Selling to open…that’s a different game. I think of it as I’m selling my right to control my future. If I’m a fool or get caught in a market without liquidity, I could be owning shares at expiration. Or on the call side buying them and pushing them through to someone else. And I have to have the cash to cover that. Or ride margin for it which is dancing with the devil. Also, closing is a buy.

That being said CarLotz is a vehicle consignment lot, with the general public feeling the economic squeeze of covid, consignment business's like CarLotz are an attractive options for people with and extra car or people looking to unload a personal car for whatever reason.

2021-06-15 00:00:00,stocks,"The Weekly DD - STEM: The next Tesla?  The new era of clean energy is among us. Clean energy is being backed by governments which means lots of new dollars flowing into the industry. What’s something that not only these companies can do better, but probably everyone in general? How about becoming more efficient? This is what STEM, as a company, is aiming to do.

**What does that even mean?**

STEM’s entire existence is to enable and optimize the energy storage process. Currently, their business model has 3 revenue generating streams:

* Battery sales: STEM purchases batteries from tier-one manufacturers (Tesla, Samsung, etc.), layer on any requested technology additives and resells them.
* Energy management: STEM sells its AI, Athena, as a service. Athena accurately distributes energy effectively, alternating the system between grid power, onsite generation, and battery power for optimal cost reduction.
* Energy sales: STEM sells power from its many storage facilities.

&#x200B;

At the moment the bulk of their revenues does come from battery sales (hardware), however, they CEO of STEM has recently said they are trying to shift away from hardware and more into their energy management software as a service (SaaS - software).

Remember, the way ‘ol WallStreet looks at companies is:

Hardware = Low Margins = BAD

Software = High Margins = GOOD

Not only is STEM making the transition into a higher margin space, they are expanding into a *growing* industry.

&#x200B;

**Renewables are here to stay**

Perhaps the most obvious example governments pouring into clean energy is the $2T 2021 Infrastructure Plan proposed by Joe Biden. One of the key focuses of this plan is a $100B investment on radically upgrading the electrical grid to include more renewable energy (perfect for STEM). Furthermore, this plan reserves another $174B to shift from gas-powered vehicles to electric vehicles. This will add additional strain to the current electrical grids and require more robust storage and energy management solutions. Although they are currently only dominating the market in California, they have big plans to expand across the entire domestic U.S, enabling them to capture a vast portion of the market.

Overall, STEM seems to be growing at an incredible rate with a large bank account to fund its rapid growth. Their cash flows are solid (recurring revenue is king) and their profit margins are very attractive. While they are currently losing money due to their high operating expenses, they expect to become profitable from 2023 onwards and are moving very quickly towards that goal.

&#x200B;

**Risks**

Like any industry, there will be some risks. In my opinion, for STEM, their biggest risk is that they are unable to capture the market in new expansions and that their SaaS and energy management service doesn’t take off. Remember, hardware industries with low margins are pretty kicked to the curb by WallStreet. Future earnings reports and expectations should emphasize their growth and transition as a software play, if not it may be reflected by the stock price taking a hit.

&#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**

Fundamentally STEM’s balance sheet is strong (completely debt free). Sitting with 525m in cash they’ve got a great opportunity to strengthen their presence outside of California, where they are currently dominating, and expand within the domestic United States. This is somewhat of a new industry, but as EV and renewable energy demand increases with the “clean energy” movement this could potentially be a good investment in a company that is set to rule this space (within the domestic US).

2021-06-15 00:00:00,stocks,"Tracking the value of 3 Reddit scrapers for 30 days Just like everyone else I want to find a way to use these Reddit scrapers to actually make some money. Since I'm a data nerd I track any that I can and analyze their hit rate, profitability, etc. I was using Unbias very successfully and making good money until it stopped updating ([see original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/))

&#x200B;

Since then I have been tracking 3 scrapers and 1 methodology I saw here:

* [Millenial Bets](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/wiki/index/user/theindulgery)
* [Hype Rider](https://hype-rider.com/reddit)
* [Dayminer](https://dayminer.herokuapp.com/)
* [Using Finviz to see if buying the biggest losers of the day and selling the next morning for a 1% profit would work](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wBbawSwzpei5Q93Erg26Ii8JADFryoM2smpNTx5F9aM/edit#gid=910606400)

&#x200B;

**Fair warning:** Google Sheets struggles with large amounts of data and a lot of people logging in, so I created multiples of each spreadsheet. If you have trouble getting in all I can recommend is continuing to try. If you do, make a copy for yourself.

&#x200B;

**Summaries:**

* **Easiest to gather data: Millenial Bets**. This is a straight copy/paste. The others required a lot of Excel copy, pasting, sorting, etc to get it to fit into the sheets
* **Best average returns: Millenial Bets.** This may be because they had the biggest quantity of results. It's hard to narrow this down to just a few tickers to buy, so looks good as a paper trader but hard to put into use in the real world
* **Best at returning a small list of tickers to buy: Dayminer.** This data narrows down to just a few, or sometimes none, per day. But the ones that do hit tend to hit pretty consistently

&#x200B;

**End Results from tracking the data:** *(When paper trading I chose categories that had a % of Profitable vs Non-Profitable returns of greater than 90%. I was aiming for highest success rate of being profitable)*

* **Millenial Bets:** 
   * **Total data points:** 5573
   * **Number of paper trades:** 2212
   * **% return (avg):** 11.44%
   * **% return (max):** 50%
   * **# of days to max profit (avg):** 6  

* **Hype Rider:** 
   * **Total data points:** 5425
   * **Number of paper trades:** 714
   * **% return (avg):** 7.03%
   * **% return (max): 13.19**%
   * **# of days to max profit (avg):** 4  

* **Dayminer:** 
   * **Total data points:** 5111
   * **Number of paper trades:** 278
   * **% return (avg):** 8.67%
   * **% return (max):** 29.77%
   * **# of days to max profit (avg):** 5

&#x200B;

**How do I use this data?** This is the question I get asked the most often. Here's what I do:

1. Every morning before market open I copy the data from the scrapers, do whatever post-processing I need to do to get it to fit into the sheets, then paste into the sheets. This captures all the sentiment data from the last 24 hours
2. When I'm ready to buy something I look at the highest profitability categories in the data crunching tabs
3. From there I narrow down THAT DAY'S list of tickers based on the highest profitability categories
4. I'll do a quick search on Reddit to see if overall sentiment is bullish or bearish. If everyone looks hopeful I'll buy
5. I look at the average % returns and the average number of days to get there and those are my exit points

I have a small position in Paysafe and am down about 20% having held it since it was still BFT.

So, any thoughts? Would it be worth buying more now or assuming it will keep on dropping? Should I just sell and get out?

Thanks!"

2021-06-15 04:38:30,stocks,"I'm holding. No intention of selling until I see their M&A plans come to fruition.  Q1 report was a one-off. Slow growth had to due with exiting high risk revenue channels. Q2 will beat expectations imo, showing positive EPS because they won't have the nearly $90 million in one-time costs associated with the merger transaction and debt pay down.  Also are refinancing some remaining debt which will add around $92 million to their bottom line annually.  Unless they try to write off some intangibles for tax reasons, all this translates to them beating analysts estimates for the next three quarters.  This may lead to price target upgrades which can be great catalysts for upward momentum.  Just my opinion."

Secret is to buy near a bottom like I did a few weeks ago with RKT at $17. Worst case I make 2k a month best case I get premium AND $1 per share.

2021-06-15 00:00:00,stocks,"I want to have a neutral, unbiased discussion about Lordstown Motors... I've obviously done extensive DD on this company, I know the pros and cons of it and I like to see both sides of things, but people on here seem to be negatively biased towards the company acting like it's a fraud while they're mostly stating half truths or lies, without doing any research of their own, sharing misinformation and fear among the community.

If you read the announcement today - [https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-results-special-committee-investigation](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-results-special-committee-investigation) you'll notice that LMC hired Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, a leading global law firm, to conduct the investigation they were assisted by technical experts from a leading automotive consulting firm. What did they say? They basically refuted all of the things Hindenburg claimed. The only thing they found were the preorders, saying that there were some preorders that shouldn't be considered real, hence the numbers were inflated (they still said there were tens of thousands of preorders as of writing of that announcement, enough demand for 2021 and 2022 full production).

So my question to this community is - **why is everyone so hateful towards LMC?** It used to be about the truck catching fire, then about the Hindenburg report, a lot of people bashed the CEO, the Baja race, LMC running out of money (they still have 587M as of March 31st, but it was known for a while that they will need extra funding to scale up production, so again, nothing new apart from them spending more than planned) but what now? CEO is gone, we've gotten guarantees that the truck catching fire was a one off incident and not a systematic problem, Hindenburg's claims confirmed to be false, except half truths on preorders, it was confirmed that there was no damage to the truck during the Baja race (people assume it broke down when it didn't), start of production still September, Lordstown week still a go for 21st, the stock will be added to Russell 3000 end of this month.

And again... I don't mind seeing/hearing both sides of things (if they're well informed and objective), that's the only way to do proper DD, but I just hate how unfairly (imo) this stock is treated."

2021-06-15 07:40:13,stocks,"Thanks for giving your opinion, I didnt realize it can look like that. All I ever wanted was for a fair discussion, because from what I have seen, people on here havent done any research on RIDE, so they are mostly spreading misinformation and false beliefs. I want people to make their own DD on the company with an open mind, not to believe all the negative articles and comments.

The bull case is they bring a well made, working truck and put aside any doubts about hub motors and their ability to produce trucks. Obviously they will need additional funding for scaling up the production, but i guess that is just another requirement for the bull case.

And what imo makes RIDE a better investment than the other stocks u named is exactly this negative bias. Sure, there are plenty of doubts and risks, but considering how much hate they have gotten in the past few months, if they succeed, the upside could be way higher than any other EV. I understand I may be delusional, but we will see in the next few months, I guess. I still have faith in them and in the product, I am looking forward for the Lordstown week."

Also keep in mind LMC can make an even cheaper version of the endurance if they would want to compete better with the cheapest f150."
2021-06-15 09:59:15,stocks,"I Mean it's obviously your own decision where you put your money. But let's compare apples to pears for a second and look at Lordstown and Canoo. Roughly same market cap. Both in the EV space. Canoo isn't lying about pre-orders and has working prototypes as well. Slower rate of cash-burn and honestly just a lot better of a reputation than Lordstown. Doesn't have the CEO and CFO resigning outta nowhere without having immediate replacement there.

I get that you like the company for whatever reason but don't think for any moment that the current negative sentiment and there house basically being in flames can't possibly result in them going under.

You are also saying that other people haven't done their DD. I mean I looked into the company long enough to know I wouldn't want to touch it with a 10 foot pole. That doesn't mean my judgement is right, just means I moved on and started looking for better investment."

Current cash balance as of last quarter is 578 million. Also only 142.000 dollars of assets in the vehicles section of the 10-Q. Where are there vehicles? Do they only have like 3 prototypes?
I mean I honestly don't see how they will make it without huge cash influx.. and I don't know if I can see that happening.

EDIT: 400M dollars untill 2024. But since they won't be profitable anytime soon that money has to come from investors."
2021-06-15 14:38:20,stocks,"So intentionally misleading people to invest through pumped up pre orders that aren't real is acceptable behavior?   Creating an artificially high valuation, so you can dump your shares on the market, like insiders have been doing since spac merger started?   Yeah that's fraud."
2021-06-15 11:41:13,stocks,"Yeah, first of all, u gotta keep in mind all of that is as of March 31st, so yes, they probably only had 3 prototypes, they should have about 50-60 by now (most i saw was around 7-8 in their garage or whatever plus others that are being used as crash dummies, so i dont think that is false). 

And about the batteries, 16 million for this year, 140 for 2022, all of that will be offset by them selling these vehicles if they indeed even reach that point. If you do the math, they plan/planned to make 30000 vehicles in 2022, so thats a bit over 4500$ per vehicle spent on batteries.

So all in all, they wont be profitable any time soon if they start production, but as time goes on and they are able to get additional funding and scale up the production as planned, they will offset a lot of the costs as they go, so less money will be needed. That being said, they plan on starting production of the RV in partnership with Camping World sometime in summer next year, they will need a lot more cash for that.

Let's get through this month, see what lordstown week brings, then we can wait for next earnings report and start of  production."

2021-06-14 23:21:02,stocks,"You can’t look at just 1 statistic to measure the stock market. You have to look at much more. That being said, I do think most of the more important indicators show the stock market is a top 3 for most expensive ever, rivaling the Dot Com bubble and 1929. I’m expecting a crash in real terms pretty soon but who knows. Was really expecting a huge crash in lot of these unprofitable tech stocks (and many of them have already dropped 20-50%+ so far). But ZIRP, QE, and money printing may be able to keep it going longer and bigger, who knows. But the market’s not cheap

2021-06-15 09:08:40,stocks,"The stock market is extremely overvalued as a collective whole but the problem is the current administration will do everything they can to make sure it doesn’t crash. It’s very bad for the economy because bailouts reinforce poor company management.

I have always disagreed with stimulus packages and helicopter money. From the trump admin to present, I think it just puts a band-aid on a growing problem making it worse in the future. I’m about 50% dry powder now and depending what happens over the next couple weeks I’ll continue to stockpile money or put some to work.

When you can throw a dart at the Wall Street journal and buy the stock it lands on and get 30% returns in a few weeks that’s a warning sign. Meme stocks are warning signs (even though I’ve made money off them), and retail investors going all in on the market are warning signs.

If a lot more companies are public, then that adds to the value of publicly held companies, if a company goes private, then they don't affect that market value of stocks (although they presumably would still have the same impact on GDP). Has the value of private companies, relative to public companies gone up or down over time?"

2021-06-14 22:29:53,stocks,"I feel like the US is probably due for a correction, because the actual profits of a lot of businesses went down during the pandemic and haven't recovered quite yet. But that doesn't mean that all the stocks will be bad investments, or that the crash will happen soon. Even if there is a crash of absolutely everything, that's why you diversify, buy the dip if you can, and don't invest more than you can afford to wait out the stock price crash.

Unless you think a stock is going to zero, or you put more of your money in the market than you are comfortable with, I wouldn't say that it's worth trying to time the market. Because odds are, you won't get the timing correct."

I don‘t think the Fed will stop it deliberately - the have proven more than once that they want to keep markets high no matter what. The one thing that could force them to change their course is lasting inflation, so keep your eyes on that. They won’t be able to tolerate current levels for very long without doing something. Of course they could also be right when they say that inflation will be temporary. I have my doubts though."
2021-06-15 04:37:03,stocks,"I believe Buffet uses Gross National Product (GNP) which is a bit different than Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Otherwise, your analysis is correct, the markets are overvalued."

2021-06-14 22:42:58,stocks,"Might want to look at the economic policies created during / after 2008. We just went through the most catostrphic market conditions possibly in human history over the last year, and the market reached all time highs.

Quantitative Easing is a giant heroin needle for the markets, and that heroin will keep getting injected anytime there's perceived weakness in the markets. And they can keep doing this until it doesn't work. Which, judging by 2020, there's not much else that you could throw at the market that would be as devastating. And yet here we are."

2021-06-14 21:50:42,stocks,It's important to realize that Buffett is not saying stocks are going to continue posting huge returns... just that the returns are likely to beat an annualized 2% a year over the next 10 years (10-year Treasury bond) and also to beat an annualized 3% a year over the next 30 years (30-year Treasury bond)

We are in an annoying spot, as new investors, because no one can agree whether the market will go up, down, or sideways, but everyone seems to be in agreement that we will not get the amazing returns we’ve had in the last 10 years. It’s like what we’re hearing is: you’re getting on the ride a little late. Your options are index investing to get okayish growth or trying to beat the market with dangerous risk, or learn how to actively invest and pick stocks. It is no wonder to me that meme stocks are soaring in popularity. A generation of new investors are looking at their options and seeing nothing enticing about a 4-5% yearly return."
2021-06-15 02:54:11,stocks,"I'm dumb. Is this his tongue and cheek way of saying that if you discounted stocks at ""normal"" rates they would be valued lower, suggesting a drop in value as interest rates inevitably rise as a result of inflationary pressures?"
2021-06-15 05:27:00,stocks,"As a big Buffett fan - I would not necessarily rely on what he says, rather pay more attention to what he does. He does have a good track of being patient before opportunities. Every time he was hoarding cash for a while it is because he expects that it can be better invested in the future. That cash has its costs and the only reason to incur those costs is the fact that he expects that the return they bring by sitting on them will be higher (discount on stocks)."
2021-06-15 08:42:03,stocks,Everything's cheap if you have $108 billion and your tax rate is 0.1% and invest in oil which is taking money from people in the future.
2021-06-14 20:12:09,stocks,"To add to this it doesn't take into account cost of capital.

Over the last 40 years we have been on a massive bull run in the credit market such that interest rates are at effectively all time lows.

As a result the value of future profits has never been higher.

Buffet indicator and other measures that don't take into account interest rates aren't going to be an accurate measure of if the market is infact overvalued."

2021-06-14 20:57:09,stocks,I was wondering if one reason the valuation is high has to do with lot of foreign governments and banks have been buying US stocks and bonds also? Like Swiss bank and Germany and China and many other countries have been investing/buying lots of US equities.

2021-06-14 21:01:12,stocks,Exactly……..comparing numbers to things from 10-20 years ago doesn’t make sense due to the current world market/financial situations.
2021-06-14 20:47:31,stocks,"At the end of the day the price of stock are implicitly tied to the price of the dollar. If stocks blow up in valuation, it shows also a sign of MMT money printing, fiscal policy, and stimulus checks. Those are put in place as companies lost revenue and as a consequence people lost their jobs.

Also, to your point, due to globalisation, crises are no longer regional, and propagate through several regions and markets - magnifying its impact - so, an US economic meltdown will also have ripple effects in other parts of the World, just like in 2008.

So, if a stock seems jacked-up in price it shows a systemic problem that affects US economy and ultimately other markets as well. The Buffet Indicator is still valuable under those assumptions."
2021-06-14 21:40:25,stocks,"Globalization is really Americanization and is very dependent on America's place in the global pecking order.

We will when rates are going to go up.    
People will and already have started rebalancing in advance of rates going up.

2021-06-15 06:03:58,stocks,"This is not true. I give the reasons why below:

>GDP certainly does account for the revenues of multinational companies (one way or another). To give an example of the iPhone, China first imports materials to assemble the hardware of the iPhone (let say for 360 USD), assembles the parts, and sell to apple for 400 USD. The value-added for manufacturing accounts only for net of 40 USD on their side of export (unless the iPhone is sold directly in China). However, most profits from Apple products do not come from its hardware - this is why they have such huge gross margins (or net sales) of around 39.97%. To illustrates this: it is ""estimated that manufacturing iPhone in China only adds about US$8 per unit versus an average retail sales price at US$749tail sales price at US$749."" The difference goes to Apple as an American company with HQ in California, for various tax reasons a lot of that money is held outside the US but that does not really matter for accounting of NX in the GDP. You can imagine that this difference is even more pronounced when it comes to services (like streaming, iCloud etc.). Some country counts that in their profits, and I assure you it's not Bermuda nor Ireland."

For the gdp calculation, iphone exports (all other things equal) increase Chinese gdp and reduce the gdp of importing countries.

It may also be worth noting that iPhone exports maybe offset by other foreign material and labor content (with respect to china).  

With respect to the US market, iPhone sales to the consumer are accounted for in consumption. So the total net value to US gdp is something on the order of (US iPhone sales price - import value per iPhone shipped to the US) × # of units."

Also can we stop with the ""all or nothing"" mentality?  It's not ""everything goes up"" or ""crash.""  I don't think there will be a 50% crash.  But I see too many thinking nothing ever goes down, look at the Tesla comments all last year into 2021, people were recommending Tesla to newbies when it was over $800. How did that work out?  wouldn't it have been better to wait 2 months to get a 20% discount?

Redditors act like time doesn't matter, because Buffett spit out a cliche for below average investors and because they never tried.  Or lived through a drop.  

Personally I am braced for either a 10% drop or a milder version of late 2018.  If you still have positions from 2008 you may not care about 10%.  I started for real in 2015 and am still contributing, meaning many smaller and newer positions ""only"" had 5-10% gains so far.  Those I have been swing trading since the end of last year but IDK if that will be repeatable.  I think the drops and rebounds YTD were very predictable.

2021-06-14 23:53:04,stocks,"I don’t disagree. A money bubble would be considered systematic risk. Unlike idiosyncratic risk, you can diversify away systematic risk. The money bubble theory means there’s too much capital and not enough good investments available so the capital ends up being invested in riskier and less desirable opportunities or the valuation multiples become higher than what financials support. I think one could argue that we are facing some of these issues today. Most of the stock valuations and PE M&As are being done at ridiculously high multiples and there’s a lot of capital chasing any and every type of investments both good and bad. Just look at how much VC money is being thrown around. If you believe we’re in a money bubble and you suspect it’s going to pop in the short term, I say you’re better off buying assets that hedge against inflation like TIPS. However, you have to consider the opportunity cost of putting your capital into something with that low of a return vs. keeping it in say a S&P 500 ETF. You run the risk of the bubble not popping but rather shrinking which means you gave up the opportunity to make a better return because you were risk adverse. It’s all about your personal risk tolerance. There’s no right answer to what your risk tolerance should be because everyone is different. You should invest however you feel comfortable."

There are some smart people on here, particularly compared to the other investing subs, but I definitely wouldn't use this sub for stock recommendations at all. The stickied DD stock post is good, but people's advice on stocks isn't trustworthy imo - maybe as an indication that I'll then look into, but that's it. For one, I'm definitely far more conservative than most on here, I have like 25% bonds/securities, 10% REIT right now. 

Different investors (because of age, income, etc.) have different risk preferences and can afford to take more/less risks, and many (especially for meme stocks) have nonsensical strategies that are purely gambling. If 'old man' stocks are fairly/undervalued and the equities have a good future in your eyes (compared to the alternative stocks) and aren't risky - buy it."

2021-06-15 10:31:45,stocks,"Having too much cash is an issue for banks.


Cash is terrible collateral when at the financial institution levels.  It loses value over time due to inflation.


Also, cash is a liability on the balance sheet.  This means that when someone deposits a large amount of cash, then the bank is on the hook for being able to pay it out at any moment if the depositor wants to withdraw.  So, in this sense, cash is not an asset.


Lately, they've been parking the cash in overnight RRP agreements with the fed by purchasing 24 hour Treasury bonds that are currently at a zero percent interest rate.  This solves the collateral problem because a treasury bond can be used as collateral against margin (borrowed money used for securities and derivatives trading).

Because the cash is a liability, they're required to be able to pay out customers needs.  If they have so much cash that their liabilities are hurting their balance sheet, then they want to disincentivise cash deposits.  


TLDR: We're full and don't want to take on more liabilities, go park your cash elsewhere or pay some fees."

Look at Ray Dalio's [all-weather portfolio](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/all-weather-portfolio/#reducing-volatility-and-drawdowns-and-hedging-against-inflation-and-rising-rates).

""As we’d expect, the All Weather Portfolio has had less than half the volatility \[compared to SPY\] and, consequently, a much higher risk-adjusted return (Sharpe) and significantly smaller drawdowns. This shows the All Weather Portfolio doing precisely what it’s intended to do: weather any storm.

If you're just a long-term buy and hold investor, you could forget about it and average into your index funds.  But it's easy to be courageous when you've been investing in a permanent bull market.

That's a good thing. This way you don't spark a recession by reducing government spending. The spending has to stay, and it's best directed where it'll circulate. When the Fed buys treasuries, the money lands in bank's reserves, and if they dont or can't lend, it does no good. When it's spent on social programs, the money ends up in pockets where it'll reach a high velocity. That's good.

- self production ie Apple resulting in less demand pressure with other manufacturers 
- reducing needs (redesign to remove chips or have existing chips do more)
- consumer demand for tech takes a bit of a cool off after a year of extremely high demand locked indoors?

The chip shortage is definitely causing a price increase today but that just means buyers want to get more efficient so they can maintain/improve their margins or drive costs down again.

In the case of beef, it appears ground beef and steak are entirely different categories and one has not replaced the other under the heading of ‘beef’.

2021-06-15 00:00:00,stocks,"Camping World ($CWH) Discussion **Summary**: 

Hey everyone, I've never posted before, but I'm a long time lurker and thought I should start contributing more. I haven't had time to write up a full DD but I summarized some of the bigger points on Camping World to get some of your thoughts on the company. Seems like an interesting opportunity given how low some of its valuation metrics are compared to the rest of the market. 

Full disclosure, I own shares of Camping World. I'm thinking of adding to my position as the share price comes down. I'm not a financial advisor and I'm not trying to convince anyone to buy Camping World. You should always do your own research on stocks. Please let me know your thoughts on the company

**Overview**: 

Camping World Holdings ($CWH) began business in 1966 and has grown to become America’s largest retailer of RVs with over 171 locations around the United States as of Dec 31, 2020.

CHW has 2 reportable segments: 1) Good Same Services & Plans and 2) RV and Outdoor Retail.

1. Good Sam Services -

According to the company’s 10-K, this segment primarily consists of various insurance, financing, extended warranties, and a couple other areas.

2. RV and Outdoor Retail - 

This segment contains what I would consider the company’s core business. According to the company’s 10-K, this segment primarily consists of new & used RV sales, finance & insurance commissions, RV servicing, branded credit cards & Good Sam Club memberships, sales of parts and outdoor equipment/gear, and a couple other areas. 

Thor Industries ($THOR) and Forest River, Inc supply approx. 69.3% and 27.9% of new RV inventory as of Dec 31, 2020.

**Financial Ratios**:

Ratios are from Yahoo Finance as of June 11, 2021:

Current Ratio: 1.45

Trailing PE ratio: 8.36

Forward PE ratio 8.96

Price/Sales: 0.35

TIE ratio: 10.57 (self calculated)

**Strengths & Positives**:

As part of their Q1 press release on May 4th, the CEO raised their full year guidance from adjusted EBITDA of $640-$690M to $770-$810. That’s a 11-26% increase after only 3 months. As a result, the stock jumped up 10% on the news to their 52-week high of \~$49 before pulling back to below $40 as of June 11th. The company didn't provide any guidance on full year revenue.

CEO purchased an additional 2,330 shares on May 11th. In Oct 2020, the company approved a share re-purchase of $100M expiring Oct 2022. There is approximately $78.5M remaining as of Q1. 

Thor Industries is CWH’s largest supplier of new RVs. On June 6, Thor reported their Q3 earnings and also announced record sales. They reported a $14.32B backlog as of April 30th, which was an increase of 550% compared to April 2020 (I’m impressed by the backlog amount, but I would take any 2020 comparisons with a grain of salt). I think watching Thor is important as it gives us independent confirmation of how the RV industry is doing.

**Bear Case, Weaknesses, & Concerns**: 

My opinion is that it’s important to look at Short interest just so that you get a sense of general sentiment on the company. Their short interest is fairly high, I think that makes it important to dive deeper into the bear case and weaknesesses.

Short Information is as of May 28th, 2021 from Yahoo Finance:

Short % of Shares Outstanding: 6.94%

Short % of Float: 16.5%

Short Ratio: 4.47

Put Ratios are from [Barchart.com](https://Barchart.com) 

Put to Call Ratio: 0.31

Put/Call Open Interest Ratio 0.93

I listed the 3 risk factors I noticed in the 2020 10-K that I thought were more important other than the obvious ones that apply to any company or just general business risks.

1. Our business is affected by the availability of financing to us and our customers. 
2. Fuel shortages, or high prices for fuel, could have a negative effect on our business.
3. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Our Floor Plan Facility contain restrictive covenants that may impair our ability to access sufficient capital and operate our business. 

In my opinion, the company has a somewhat large amount of debt. As of March 31, they had $617M of current debt and $1.98B of long-term debt. When I saw these figures, my first thought was that the company is already pretty leveraged. Their TIE ratio is relatively low and the company only has $298M in cash+receivables. The balance sheet and cash flow are healthy and the company’s sales are seasonal (Q2 and Q3 were about 58% of 2020 sales). In Q2 of last year, made a \~383M to pay down debt. I don’t think their current level of debt is concerning, but it’s definitely something to keep an eye on going forward.

In the Auditor’s opinion, I noticed that 1 of their listed critical audit matters is Finance & Insurance revenue recognition. The company receives commissions from 3rd party insurance providers for selling multi-year contracts to customers. The company recognizes the revenue net of chargebacks (chargebacks occur when customers cancel contracts early). As of Dec 31, 2020, chargeback liabilities on the Balance sheet were $58.9M. The area of risk I see is that the auditor discloses that estimating these liabilities requires a high degree of judgement and actuarial specialists. My opinion is with all the change in the post-covid world, there is some risk that the estimated future chargebacks could be larger than estimated.

I noticed that the industry also tends to take a hit when gas prices rise. The gas prices are definitely something to keep a close eye on as prices rise compared to 2020, but I've seen different projections on whether they'll surpass 2019 average price levels. Any more outages like the Colonial Pipeline hack earlier this year would definitely put pressure on gas prices. I also noticed that OPEC is gradually raising production which should increase supply, but that can always change. I'm great at looking at commodity prices and I mainly relied on articles. If anyone has greater insight, please share.

**TL; DR**:

Camping world is an interesting stock with a PE ratio of \~8 combined with a strong surge in RV interest. They had a strong results in Q1 and raised full year guidance, but the stock has come down \~20% since reaching a 2021 high in early May. However, there are several bear cases that will continue to put pressure on the stock. Let me know your thoughts on the company"

2021-06-15 13:01:11,stocks,"The stock is a target of short selling for about 20% SI. There’s a conflict between the stellar sales number and the disbelief of its ability for continuing profits. As a result you see the price movement is quite volatile.   


I’m betting on the bullish side. $CWH has been acquiring small businesses like crazy this year and gradually achieving a monopoly status. Also outdoor recreation as a whole is experiencing a boom post COVID."
2021-06-15 17:26:59,stocks,"I live in the RV capital of the world (Elkhart County, IN) and do capital equipment/service work with all the major producers and the sentiment is things will continue to grow. They have continued to expand and retool and are pushing 60+ new units daily. RVs are basically plywood and fiberglass that are held together by tape/silicone. The margins are insane per unit. I have heard people say the industry is going to tank since I moved here in 2016, but they continue to push record sales. At this point the argument against the RV industry is the same as the bear case for the entire market: “we’re at ATHs, it has to come down sometime”!"

Edit: 

Below is from their latest 10-q:

2. DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE
The Company generates revenue from marketplace and logistics services provided to merchants. Revenue is recognized as the Company transfers control of promised goods or services to its users in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company considers both the merchant and the user to be customers. The Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based upon its evaluation of whether the Company obtains control of the specified goods or services by considering if it is primarily responsible for fulfillment of the promise, has inventory risk, has latitude in establishing pricing and selecting suppliers, among other factors. **Based on these factors, marketplace revenue is generally recognized on a net basis and logistics revenue is generally recognized on a gross basis.** Revenue excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including indirect taxes."

Shopify stock has ebbed and flowed between a relatively consistent range of $1,000-$1,300 per share over the past three months. Currently, Shopify trades at roughly $1,200.

Now, it’s worth noting that this stock is still down approximately 20% from its all-time high of nearly $1,500 per share seen earlier this year. Indeed, sorting out whether this recent dip in SHOP stock is worth a buy is the main concern for most investors. (See Shopify stock analysis on TipRanks)

Since the different phases are less like phase 1> 2 > 3 > 4 and instead it could be like 2 phase 2 trials, then 3 phase 3. The different phase numbers really just mean what they’re allowed to test in each trial, like a phase 2 is usually less than 100 patients while a phase 3 drug is approved for trials greater than 100.

2021-06-15 08:19:48,stocks,"The premiums dropped considerably yesterday. I sold mine on Friday, spread across strikes at 25, 26, 27, and 28, expiring this Friday. I had 1500 shares at the time and brought in around $1200 in premiums. Last Thursday I made $1000 in premiums on CCs expiring the next day. That's how insane the call prices were.

I bought 500 more shares yesterday when it fell. I'll wait and see what happens today. If it spikes back up, I'll sell CC in the high 20s. If not, I'll probably go with 25 or 26.

Ultimately, it just depends on where you are happy selling. I would be fine with losing my new shares at $25 for a quick return."
2021-06-15 08:33:34,stocks,Yeah i was looking at the 25 and 26 strikes yesterday and all the premiums were like $50. So i just didn't bother. I've got about 190 shares so for $50 it's probably just better to ride

NIO was bailed out by the government and imho, it was clearly 100% politically motivated. They did it to keep Tesla from taking their market. NIO was basically a BS company that didnt even make their own cars and barely had any sales. Then when near bankruptcy they got bailed out and all of a sudden they had money for factories and sales boomed.

Next, and I keep saying this around Reddit, but you cannot own NIO, or any Chinese, stock. The ADR you are buying does not give you any stock ownership of any kind nor is it backed by China or the companies themselves nor are the ADR's located in the USA. Do not buy these...

2) They have no chance of competing with the big dogs in the industry.  Aside from Tesla, all major auto manufacturers have committed to transitioning most or all of their fleets over to EV.  Ford makes an electric version of the most popular truck in the world already.

3) They went public less than a year ago and are already running out of money, just recently announcing they may not be able to continue as a going concern.

4) They were caught embellishing their numbers to make it look like they had actual orders when they didn't.  The knob of a CEO's response was ""There will always be haters,"" and, ""Nobody thought we had actual orders, did they?""

5) CEO and CFO have both been ousted.

2021-06-15 04:55:04,stocks,"The ADR's are not real stock bud. They never were. They are contracts by 3rd parties (not the actual company) that say you get the profit of a real stock without actually owning said stock. So in other words, if China or the USA says these are illegal, you are wiped out in an instant BUT it would not effect the real Chinese stock in any way. They dont get delisted and their business carries on as normal.

And the problems dont stop there. In theory, if the ADR bank is honest, they can sell their real shares in China (assuming China lets them) and then turn over the money to the ADR holders. But here is the wrench. Why should they? You literally have no way to compel them. These are 3rd parties sitting on billions in a nation where you cant sue... And on top of that, the assets are in China, not in the country of the ADR! LoL.

On top of that, why would China allow it if said activity was illegal to begin with? China wont help you in this scenario because the ADR holders will be considered criminals if they gave you said money as if you were an owner. In fact they may confiscate the real shares for themselves similar to how we confiscate illegal contraband. And no one will blame them for it either because, after all, it was illegal activity.

Thats the problem. These are not normal ADRs. These are considered grey territory precisely because China and the USA have not addressed it. China has however stated many many times, we cannot own Chinese stocks. Period. 

Why do you suppose they havent addressed the ADR's yet given how popular they have become? You think they arent aware? If they think these are good for China, why wouldnt they say something? Ill tell you why. Because this is a great weapon to use one day to destabilize the US economy. They can control the narrative in China since they control all the media and internet but here in the US, we are a free speech country and it would cause a crash. What a great weapon to wield if you think about it..."

2021-06-14 23:12:59,stocks,"I'm probably going to get a margin call. Any tips?

Today I bought +1 SPY $423c 6/14exp. I didn't close it by mistake and it expired ITM.

I called my broker and they do not see a ""do not execute"" request made on my behalf, so it looks like I'm about to pay $42,300 for 100 shares of SPY. I can't afford this, my entire portfolio is about $40,000 and my cash is already at $0.

I think I'm going to wake up tomorrow to a huge negative cash balance and will definitely be in margin call territory. I plan to sell them ASAP and cross my fingers that the price doesn't drop in premarket, but will my broker beat me to it and just start selling random things for me? I understand it's the broker's choice, but is there a way to have these SPY shares sold first? Will they give me a day to figure it out and exit strategically or how rushed is this?

Obviously I made a pretty big mistake and I'm a dumbass, but I don't want to blow up my account on a winning trade. Really wishing their risk dept closed it automatically (not a backup plan, just would be nice) to get the cash profit now and be done with it, but we're past that now.

Any of you been in a similar situation? Using Schwab if that helps. Ty.

Edit: Woke up to negative balance as expected. Sold them all for $424.97. Could've had $177 profit off a $53 investment (337% gain), instead I made $144 off a $42,353 investment (0.34% gain). Ouch."

Since this date last week, it has been shown that when used in junction with $PGEN effectiveness has raised in the 79-99% range for various age groups. This only raises chances to pass FDA approval, especially considering they are trying to show that they are working towards cures for diseases without current cures this year. Approval vote is 7-2-21 and only expect price to fluctuate upwards until then. 

Do your own DD but its my PERSONAL opinion that the stock is a great opportunity even without considering it’s possible position if it passes FDA. Just trying to bring attention to a good opportunity incase it doesnt hit the big movers tab, even though it was up 13.24% today.

2021-06-15 08:14:00,stocks,"Last thursday CPI data showed that inflation is indeed transitionary not an increasing worry.

That means overvalued value stocks are on selling block and tech is back on menu in very very simplistic terms.

I don't think it was manufactured as other ssaid, because i was literally retail and waiting for the same data, when it came thursday i sold value positions instantly and bought ton of tech ones and i never made so much money before from being what could be seen as day trading junkie.

Seems like everything these days are looked through conspirational lense when it shouldn't be.

If inflation is horrible, value stock go up, tech go down

If inflation is transitional, value stock go back to their shithole and tech go up.

If people can't follow these things, just buy stocks and check on them after few years, where these small swings won't matter."

I thought about picking some up a while ago but the reason I decided against it is that they actually haven't made any many (EPS is always negative).

Arguably youtube made a new push with their premium service that allows you to listen to playlists without watching the video. There are more, but the case in point is that they feel like Netflix in that they were the first to really do music streaming right imo, but they also lost their moat.

So if there's a seller at $100 and a seller at $101 and you go in the buy two shares at the going market rate, you'll buy the lowest first, then the second one and the ticker will reflect that movement (obviously far more volume than just you).

When a stock is climbing fast, many are watching and likely have picked a sale price they're happy with. If too many people agree on the sale price, there might be some resistance if there's too many sellers vs buyers at that value and it could halt the movement.

2021-06-14 21:31:23,stocks,"This is a tough question because a lot of it comes down to time frames, goals, and investing strategies. I'll also add I can't say it's possible to necessarily be early on a trend or that you'd even want to be, but the goal is to get in while there is still room to grow and before the momentum has died out and other areas start to out perform it. 

I like these conversations, but I'm not a fan of giving out specific advice. The reasons are obvious, it's one thing to advise someone to get into a trade, it's completely different for them to know how to manage that trade and when to exit. 

But I'll mention a recent popular trend, and I don't think it's over yet.

The inflation trade is dead. 

This likely brings investors back to a low interest rate, high growth chasing environment.

I know the popular narrative is that inflation is high and investors should be concerned. They should position themselves for it, and they did, but then May's numbers came out and now they know it isn't happening and they're moving on.

It's probably counter intuitive to what a lot of people have heard, because most people who understand inflation aren't exactly drawing ratings on CNBC.

I'm not going to get into the factors of inflation to much, other than we have a deflationary economic system, so inflation just is not an inherent concern to begin with, except for special scenarios, and the predictions of this being one of them have already proven false. 

I'll address some numbers though for clarification.

You've likely heard 5% year over year inflation and know that is well above the Feds target of 2%. 

The reason this isn't a concern is that 2020 gives an exaggerated base effect, because during 2020 we actually had periods of deflation, so it throws year over year data off. 

When you zoom out to negate the exaggerated base effect you see that since 2019 we have 2.5% annualized inflation, hardly anything to write home about and not the run away inflation investors care about.

The reason May was important is it was the last month of 2020 before the deflation ended and the economy began experiencing inflation again. So if we were going to see high inflation it would've showed up in May. After that the economy started to normalize although inflation stayed low the rest of the year, so you'll still see a high base effect, just not as much.

Then you have the other signs, and that is the supply chain is coming back. Lumber is down over 40%, Corn is down, steel is down, and basically you name a commodity it is down from their high. Most importantly interest rates on treasuries are down as well. 

That doesn't happen when inflation hits. It does happen when a supply shortage starts to get corrected though.

Now we aren't there yet, which is why I think the trend still has room to grow and a lot of people haven't left their inflation bunkers yet. 

So you'll still see supply issues, and higher than average YOY inflation, but the rate will begin decreasing, rather than increasing. Which is the important part. It's a trend to normalized inflation."

2021-06-15 02:03:20,stocks,"/u/piggydancer thanks for this post. In another community, I actually was trying to develop a conversation around general strategy, however the topic got derailed. I was hoping that you would help me with a few things.  
I will call myself a passive investor. Prior to COVID, I was pretty satisfied with looking for low-cost ETFs that tracked the S&P, and then on occasion, when I was feeling hands on, I'd enter leveraged ETFs to boost my returns. I know those are risky, however I actually work with those at my job, so I am comfortable entering/exiting without losing my shirt. Anyway, during COVID, I decided to start paying attention to the market more and find out how savvy investors move. I am currently thinking about how to develop a strategy for a post (extremely) bullish environment that we're in.  
Onto my questions about your comments. Please correct any inaccurate assumptions that I may have made:

>The inflation trade is dead. This likely brings investors back to a low interest rate, high growth chasing environment.

What does your ""inflation trade"" comment refer to? A sentiment that we were going to be entering a high(er) inflationary market? If so, can you provide a source for where the theory was espoused, and what subsequently debunked it?  


>I know the popular narrative is that inflation is high and investors should be concerned. They should position themselves for it, and they did, but then May's numbers came out and now they know it isn't happening and they're moving on.

  
What are the ""May numbers"" that you are referring to? Also, in what way would you expect investors to position themselves for a high inflationary market? I ask in a very general sense because I know that a multitude of factors influence people's investment  decisions, like their age, proximity to retirement, and capital...amongst other things. Or is this comment geared more towards adjusting your market capitalization (i.e. exit small cap or growth companies that depend on lending) and/or adjusting your portfolio sector (i.e. enter sectors that benefits from rising rates)

>You've likely heard 5% year over year inflation and know that is well above the Feds target of 2%.

I had heard about the Fed's targeted rate, but not the 5% YoY rate. Where can I find this at? Is it within FRED data somewhere?

>The reason this isn't a concern is that 2020 gives an exaggerated base effect, because during 2020 we actually had periods of deflation, so it throws year over year data off.

&#x200B;

What is ""base effect""? And how could I observe where we had deflationary periods that you're referring to?

>Then you have the other signs, and that is the supply chain is coming back. Lumber is down over 40%, Corn is down, steel is down, and basically you name a commodity it is down from their high. Most importantly interest rates on treasuries are down as well.

Do you personally become aware of supply chain from some financial source, such as Bloomberg? Or are you referring to in the general sense from articles that you've read, or companies that have shared improvement in these areas? Also, I've been trying to learn where to keep trace of lumber and commodities prices. Would you have a source for these?

  
I've enjoyed this conversation, and I hope you don't mind answering my follow-up questions. I really look forward to fleshing out my plan of keeping track of inflation and various costs. I think this is an important first step for me to be able to understand cycles as well as having a sound process in place for being able to best match investment opportunities with what is going on in the world.  
Thanks!"

That's is what I was referring too. The expectations of higher and continued rising inflation.

This was a personal opinion about a trend so I don't have a direct source. 


>What are the ""May numbers"" that you are referring to? Also, in what way would you expect investors to position themselves for a high inflationary market?

""May numbers"" is a reference to the monthly economic data that is released by the Fed. 

An investor positioning themselves for inflation would typically mean a higher allocation to commodities and industries benefitting from them. Value stocks tend to out perform growth stocks. Real estate and hard assets are other ways investors will position themselves. 

>I had heard about the Fed's targeted rate, but not the 5% YoY rate. Where can I find this at? Is it within FRED data somewhere?

All economic data is public information including how it is gathered and the way it is calculated to determine the output. You'll likely find any inflation data you're looking for from any period in time through a quick Google search.

It'll likely bring you to a government website, but it's honestly much easier to search for specific data using Google and having them take you there than using their own site.

>What is ""base effect""? And how could I observe where we had deflationary periods that you're referring to?

The 5% number of early measures the inflation change from May 2020 to May 2021. 

So May 2020 would be the base. 

Base effect refers to how changing that base point can change the entire data set. 

The example I used was changing May 2020 to May 2019. 

When there are abnormal events it cause typical methods of data collection to turn out very unreliable or misleading numbers without proper context. 

What I referred to was the 2020 monthly inflation data. [Here](https://cpiinflationcalculator.com/2020-cpi-and-inflation-rate-for-the-united-states/) is a chart if you want to look. 

>Do you personally become aware of supply chain from some financial source, such as Bloomberg? Or are you referring to in the general sense from articles that you've read, or companies that have shared improvement in these areas?

I don't have any inside information.

I do read a lot, and I make sure to stay up-to-date with the news.

This varies from books, news articles, blogs, and podcasts. Depending on what I'm looking to learn about. But probably the best thing to do is read a lot, and listen to audio when reading isn't applicable."

2021-06-14 21:42:15,stocks,Options is the way to go when it comes to trading. Definitely shares for long term but you get more leverage and multiple ways to make profit.
2021-06-14 21:59:19,stocks,"I try not to trade, but I sometimes make little ""bets"" in my IRA with maybe $2k on some stock I think may go up and then get out once it does for a tiny profit.  It's fun.  Hey if I make $50 for the day, I'm happy.  It's like finding a $50 laying in the parking lot.

I recently did this with MSFT.  I put in 3k cash at $249 for 12 shares and so far have made $125.  My main MSFT holding is in my taxable, but I figured I could make a little more since tech is back a little.  I'll exit though when I see fit because I'm over my allocation on MSFT.  But msft is not that risky.

I did it with CRWD too.  Put in $1062 for 5 shares at 212 and now I'm up $105.  My main CRWD long term holding is also in my taxable.

So I made a couple hundred which isn't much but it's something. Then I'll go back to cash in those positions in the IRA and wait for a correction or whatever and see if I can further profit.

I know probably easier with options, but I don't understand them."

Like amazon stock is over 3K, if you really want leverage and wanted to buy 100 shares of amazon stock, that would be $300,000 your risking. With options, you can leverage that same 100 shares for a fraction of that, maybe a couple hundred to a couple thousand

You can learn options and mess around with like $100 here and there and get a better risk to reward ratio"

2021-06-15 08:47:41,stocks,"Especially since the whole point of holding GME has been misconstrued to the point of memery. The strategy initially was to hold and create a short squeeze, not a rare event in stocks normally, but super rare in this magnitude and scope. Holding GME of a rally after running Melvin Capital to the ground, that's what a small group of people did at the beginning. Most people got in too late to make any real money. The strategy was to hold to perpetuate the short squeeze and force hedge funds to buy back at a higher price. 

I think overtime, this strategy somehow poorly translated though memes to where people are unironically trying to justify GME' stock price is worth the long term hold because of non-existent fundamentals. Gamestop has no fundamentals anymore, lol. Not at that price. 

Average people pouring into the stock market don't understand that at any given point in time, they aren't necessarily creating a short squeeze by holding the stock at that point in time. 

And then the people sharing the memes aren't necessarily  perpetuating an agenda to raise the stock price, rather just sharing a meme and having fun, but the GME crowd interprets it that way, and sees it as further reinforcement of what their doing.

2021-06-14 23:43:51,stocks,"NVDA: Most of the data I looked at looks very good.  But I don't quite know if I would buy this one or not.

Good news:

* The price has been headed up quite nicely in both the last 50 days (+16.6%) and the last 200 (+27.9%).
* The price is also more than double the 52-week low.
* The ten day average volume is higher than the 3 month volume.
* Forward and trailing PE are both large and positive.
* Ditto for Eps.
* Beta is 1.37, not too risky looking.
* EPS has been looking good for the last four quarters and the estimate for the next quarter is good too.
* They have consistently beat estimates, lending confidence for the next estimate. That estimate is 4.11 vs 3.66, i.e. better than the previous quarter.
* Revenue and earnings have been increasing steadily, at least for the last four quarters.
* Expenses have been under control, i.e. not going crazy.
* Other income has turned positive from negative the previous three quarters.
* Assets have been increasing fairly steadily with no ugliness in liabilities.

Indifferent?

* Financing costs look pretty red.
* Investing cash flow is also red, but improving.

Bad news:

* Price/Book is almost 24.  That's the biggest concern I see. I like everything up this point but that's a pretty huge number."
2021-06-15 05:37:44,stocks,"I think this is a good start, and you're looking at some good things.  I don't personally tend to put too much weight into the Beta, P/B (I prefer earnings), specific cash flows (like investing and financing).  I like to look at the overall balance sheet to see if a company has cash to 1. cover their debts 2. make acquisitions and/or 3. invest in R/D and marketing to grow their market share.  Nvidia has a very strong balance sheet and their cash + cash equivalents far outpace their current liabilities.  This means they do have freedom to use their cash to either expand their business or pay a dividend.  

Volume can be a good technical indicator as it gives you a feel for the overall short-term sentiment of the market, but I don't find it useful for fundamental analysis where I'm looking to hold a company for more than 3 years.

The P/E ratio being big is not necessarily a good thing - it is currently 85 for Nvidia.  This means for every 85 dollars you invest, the company will earn 1 dollar per year.  Obviously it's a moving statistic that changes with the price of the company and also with earnings increases/decreases, but it's a good snapshot in time.  Negative P/E means the company isn't profitable at all.  A low positive number, like 20, means the company is earning more money per dollar you invest in them.

Companies that expect to grow their earnings aggressively in the future will usually trade at a less favorable P/E ratio, because people are anticipating those higher future earnings.  The market is 'pricing in' the future growth of the company.  If the company continues to grow, you can see the stock price growth maintained, but if their growth stagnates then you can very quickly see the stock price collapse back towards a smaller P/E ratio (see what happened with Netflix this last quarter).

So, from what you've done so far I can decipher that Nvidia is profitable and their profit is growing pretty rapidly.  They have a strong amount of cash which I like.  Their current valuation is very aggressive, with a lot of future growth priced in (you see that in the P/B and P/E ratios).

The question to be asked, then, is will Nvidia continue to grow at a rate where their current valuation continues to expand.  To answer that, you would need to look at their business and the industry.  What sectors are Nvidia currently leading in?  Will those sectors grow?  Will Nvidia be able to expand market share in those sectors, or do they have any sort of competitive advantage in them that allow them to dominate?  Will Nvidia be able to maintain their profit margins, or do you see competitors rising and undercutting prices?  

These are all complex questions, which is why investing can be tricky.  You can see by the recent price increase in the stock that the market in general really likes the future prospects of the company.  Be careful with using market sentiment as your guiding principle, though - things can turn very quickly and you won't be out of a bad trade before the professionals will be.  All it takes is one quarter of bad guidance and the stock price could crater in post-market before you have the ability to react."
2021-06-14 21:21:43,stocks,"You're forgetting child tax credits and suddenly employees paying $15 or more an hour. That will increase the prices for everything with more disposable income.

Think about the demand for cars right now. Think about the next 6 months how people working 12 an hour jobs will now make $15 an hour, or how families will have an extra $300-900 a month child credit when they don't need it. 

Growth will happen but not at the gains we saw in the past. Silver and gold may potentially outperform equities over a 10 year period if you load up on them now"
2021-06-14 20:54:25,stocks,"Slightly alarmed at reading the word dividend as part of the title, since US gov automatically taxes dividends for overseas investors as far as I know."
2021-06-15 03:16:09,stocks,"I personally would only like to wait a maximum of 15 years at current earnings for a company to produce the cash equivalent of the value of the company. Theoretically, if they liquidated the company, I'd then have just got at least my initial investment returned, after 15 years of it sat there. Theoretically, you can sort of consider the PE as the number of years you have to wait before you see profit on your investment. 

Obviously this kind of thinking makes much more sense for investors that have billions to invest, and who have little choice but to invest the vast majority of their capital for the long term. But it helps to follow their way of thinking, as those whales are the ones that move stock prices significantly. So I like to think a PE of 15 is maximum fair value for a value stock whose earnings are stagnant or growing slowly. A PE above that, is only sustainable if the stock ends up growing earnings substantially.

So a PE of 25 is only appealing to me if I think in the next two years their price (today) to earnings (in three years times) is going to be 15 or less, and for the earnings to continue growing thereafter too. Others have different levels of acceptance. Some of the tech companies at the moment with PE of more than a 100 are unlikely to grow earnings anywhere near the expected levels. Its fascinating to me that they're so high. I wonder if people expect inflation to rise so significantly (but economic output to somehow stay buoyant enough despite that inflation) for the PEs to come down (in nominal monetary terms at least) so that the growth they are presumably expecting to happen happens, or if they just bought stocks because everyone else is doing it."

2021-06-15 05:58:17,stocks,"The number one benchmark for Quantum Computers is Quantum Volume. This number tells you how complex the algorithm can be, before the QC can't handle it anymore.

Honeywell published their roadmap up until 2025, in which they state that they will reach a QV of 640.000. They needed to publish that, since they are selling subscribtions for thoses systems. (I think this is why they are doing the spin off, since no one wants to pay for a subscribtion if they can get a better QC from IonQ)

IonQ claims that they have hit a QV of around 4 million, with their latest system. This isn't published in a scientific paper yet, but this is how they did with their older system aswell and I think they are waiting for the merger to publish it, to get some press.

The nice thing about comparing IonQ and Honeywell is that they are both using Trapped Ions, therefore they are the most comparable systems.

And no I don't work for them. I just spend about 2 month looking at it, since I always wanted to get into Quantum Computing as an investment. The base case in Quantum Computing is pretty ""easy"" to understand, while the details are pretty hard. So you don't need to be an expert to grasp it."

2021-06-15 13:24:44,stocks,"Not sure about Etrade, but TD allows for a conditional trailing stop order. What that means is, you set up an order to trigger at a certain price. Let’s say you set it to trigger at $10. When the price reaches $10, the order is live. 

Now here’s the cool part.  The “trailing stop” means the order will remain live until it drops by a certain amount you set. Let’s say you set your trailing stop for 0.50.  That means your stock will only sell when it drops 50 cents (remember it’s continuing to rise until then).  So here’s how that plays out given the example:

You set your trigger at $10. The order goes “live” at $10. The price goes to 10.50, then 11, then 11.20, then 11.40, then 12, then 12.50, then 12.20, then 12... then it automatically sells at 12.

I usually have been adding around $500 a week most weeks when life is slow and I don't have a lot of expenses, but I try to at least buy a few shares of one of the ETF's I'm in at the very least."

2021-06-15 16:05:47,stocks,"This is a pretty solid portfolio, personally I would put a few etfs for other sectors like biotech/genomics, semiconductors, fang stocks etc etc that have good future prospects to spice things up and get more gains"
2021-06-15 10:43:12,stocks,Would recommend holding onto it if you need it soonish
2021-06-15 18:46:52,stocks,"I like it, especially if you believe the inflation story. Gold. Tips. BerkB and a few faang. Check out water  FIW. It went up today when everything went down."
2021-06-15 00:11:04,stocks,AAPL is set it and forget it.  Majority of my taxable is AAPL.
2021-06-14 22:05:38,stocks,Abbvie 🥺 seems like such a good healthcare stonk and could be a good dividend growth play for the years. I’m curious if there’s a reason why you might be bullish on Arkx of the many ark Etfs
2021-06-15 11:03:51,stocks,"Great picks, but a little heavy in tech. Consider putting some money into other sectors. RTX, OSK, KR, GM, O, and BP are some of my favorite non-techs."
2021-06-15 00:47:54,stocks,"The split seems to have really helped Tesla stock a lot, so probably not a reason to sell. However, it has risen up a lot in the past few years. There's also rumors that Ethereum will be switching to proof of stake, which would cut drastically on GPU usage in the crypto space."
2021-06-15 00:44:21,stocks,"Very boring but safe ;)

I think VTI is going to underdeliver in terms of returns. There are a lot of countries whose stock market seems to be going nowhere, so I would personally reduce that allocation if it were my money. Maybe look into REIT ETFs to diversify into real estate."
2021-06-15 00:40:23,stocks,"You have too many stocks IMO. With so many positions you can't really follow them all closely.

FUV: I was really not impressed with their last earnings call. They produced something like 80 vehicles in 2020. About 3 days per vehicle, and their vehicles are relatively simple. I know there was a pandemic, but I was like, what the hell are they doing over there? There are much better EV stocks that you could invest in IMO, like LEV and Proterra.

Besides that. You're young, so plenty of time to make mistakes I guess, but if I were you, I would not waste money on ""meme stocks"". It's pretty much gambling.

You do what you want with this advice, but if I were you, I would pick something like 4-5 individual stocks I really believe in. Which ones would you really invest in from the long term? (after researching them). Invest 50% in those and put the rest of your money in an S&P or Nasdaq ETF for safe, predictable growth. Just my 2 cents."
2021-06-15 11:01:31,stocks,"You have some good picks, among plenty I know nothing about. Personally, I'd dump or at the very least trim down the meme stocks (BB especially) and consolidate in BABA and PLTR."
2021-06-14 22:02:33,stocks,Let’s get this bread my triple leveraged tech stonk vrother
2021-06-15 05:30:03,stocks,I love SE. It always seems to recover well from dips and has a continuing speedy growth
2021-06-15 18:37:09,stocks,"thanks! thats kind of exactly what I was planning on doing so glad I had my mind in the right place. I wanted to cop a few more into VTI because I feel like that's a nice generic fund, was gonna expand out after.

what are fang stocks?"
2021-06-15 11:45:32,stocks,"Everyone says that, but imagine holding $1mm cash in this inflationary environment.  Would you?"
2021-06-14 23:17:37,stocks,"bullish on ARKX due to space.  I just think space is the future which it obviously is.  The holdings suck as of right now but not many companies are space related.  Once space ventures begin opening up and the holdings become strictly space related I feel it'll be a huge get and for $25 bucks a pop, why not grab up 25 shares and hold super long term.  IT's a risk for sure, but I like space so going to stick with it

Also love ABBV, probably one of my favorite stonkies out"
2021-06-15 12:57:27,stocks,"Thanks for the suggestion, I'm looking to diversify into other sectors. I was thinking of putting some in SCCO as well."
2021-06-14 22:01:47,stocks,Thing is coming down a peg sometime before or after split. When that happens myself and other buyers would be stepping in
2021-06-15 13:50:08,stocks,Solid advice.
2021-06-15 14:11:53,stocks,"I have stop losses set for the meme stocks so I would be still in profit, although BB I have only added recently so I am going to let that run for some weeks before setting one. If I have to eat the loss so be it, I'll have covered the cost with the profits from other stocks (If the sell at the current stop limit I have set)"
2021-06-15 05:38:02,stocks,"Yes, you’re right. SE has huge potential and I think that’s reflected in it’s continuous growth. 

I’m incredibly optimistic about MNTN too, I’d check that out if you haven’t already :)"

2021-06-14 23:29:36,stocks,I’m asking because I’m bullish on innovation in general and am considering leaps for arkx because the contracts wouldn’t require much collateral. Arkx has just been in the back of my mind
2021-06-15 13:02:45,stocks,"To me the fact we're designing and building a custom house changes things.  The final price of the house (most costs hitting during construction) is in our control, as is the timetable.  I work in construction project management so I feel fairly in control of costs spiraling.  We will keep enough in cash to buy a lot and start paying an architect. We are also young, so this isn't a situation where we desperately want to move into the home before our kids go off the college."
2021-06-15 11:12:07,stocks,"Recognizing that you're just explaining your personal opinion, I'm super bullish on BABA and disagree with your rationale for not investing in it. In the context of your comments specifically:

Share price isn't necessarily indicative of a company's success. Alibaba still holds a commanding market share lead with no signs of ceding that position anytime soon. Jack Ma is important figure affiliated with Alibaba, but Alibaba's success isn't contingent upon Ma. Similarly, Alibaba is now one of those companies that is too big to fail; the CCP can reign them in as it's the supreme authority of the land, but it's actually thrown its weight behind Alibaba among other major firms (e.g: AI national champions). Alibaba and e-commerce generally has plenty of room to grow as more Chinese are brought online via national modernization efforts, as well as international expansion and acquisitions broaden their global market access."
2021-06-15 13:31:14,stocks,"Dont be a dick. 

Obviously some people think dividends are relevant. Im pretty sure TRCH is up like 50% today simply because of a new dividend."
2021-06-15 13:20:33,stocks,"Well it seems you have more knowledge in the houses than I do. The advice I hear often and agree with is that if someone needs money within 3 years or so, that it's better put in a high yield savings account so that in the event of a crash, life's plans aren't derailed.

You also mention the high inflation occurring right now (which is true), but there are many bears at there that look at the current market and think it's going to collapse any month. There is also the fear that the FED will have to raise interest rates (I don't think anytime immediate) to counteract the inflation. Raising rates could be a catalyst for a correction since growth would get hit really hard."
2021-06-15 13:45:29,stocks,"They can think that.

But it doesn't make it any more true"
2021-06-15 12:42:38,stocks,I need to learn how to do that. I fear all options too much for some reason.
2021-06-15 12:47:19,stocks,You will be fine.
2021-06-15 12:44:31,stocks,"I bought 50K in 2008, and rode it up 10x. It was getting crazy, and last September and earlier this year I exited my positions. The company is great though and should do well over the next few years as 5G and the M1 revolution play out."
2021-06-15 12:46:48,stocks,"You should look into how good the M1 chips are. They're literally causing Macs, that 35+ year old platform, to bring in tons of new sales, and it's only starting. It's huge, and APPL has a lower PE than many much more capable companies."
2021-06-15 12:49:48,stocks,"[You should learn about them.](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/) They're nothing to be scared of if you take the time to understand them and have a willingness to take on a little risk. For us small retail investors, it allows you to leverage your money to increase potential returns. Basically, if you pick reliable tickers, buy options *at least* 3 months out (preferably 6-12), and pick strike prices near the current price, you should do well.

It's when you pick short dated options on volatile stocks with far OTM strikes that they become dangerous."
