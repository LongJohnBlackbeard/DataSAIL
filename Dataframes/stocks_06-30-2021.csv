2021-06-30 19:56:37,wallstreetbets,There is no way I would sell those
2021-06-30 19:56:26,wallstreetbets,"I almost have exactly the same leaps as you. If you're really scared of missing out on profits, just sell half and ride the rest. I'm just gonna ride mine out, no rush anyway. It might dip, it might spike but I'm probably just gonna exercise the calls in the end"
2021-06-30 19:59:50,wallstreetbets,Bitches sell...legends hold
2021-06-30 19:58:44,wallstreetbets,Holding 10x 85$c currently up 185% 1/22 exp
2021-06-30 19:53:24,wallstreetbets,Honestly if it were me I would have sold at 20 percent profit but these are leaps and will prob be worth a million dollars in 2023.
2021-06-30 19:51:39,wallstreetbets,I say take profit. Because the first one is always free.
2021-06-30 19:50:44,wallstreetbets,Would love the opinion of the crowds on this one. I've owned these 2023 AMC LEAP calls for like a month. Already up 50%. Should I sell or hold until mid-2022 then sell before theta decay starts accelerating.
2021-06-30 19:53:54,wallstreetbets,"I would sell and wait for correction 
It's ready over bought"
2021-06-30 19:51:56,wallstreetbets,Stop loss
2021-06-30 19:52:03,wallstreetbets,I wish i knew what a leap call was
2021-06-30 19:52:01,wallstreetbets,Sell and buy more
2021-06-30 19:52:05,wallstreetbets,You can always go right back in after a dip
2021-06-30 19:53:08,wallstreetbets,Trailing stop loss
2021-06-30 19:52:57,wallstreetbets,Good call.
2021-06-30 19:52:46,wallstreetbets,It's call that has more than 1 year to expiration. Basically just really far out calls.
2021-06-30 19:57:49,wallstreetbets,A call option that may have an experation date a year or more in the future.. long term equaties anticipatio n securiries.. not sure where the p is in that.. 2023 exp date for example..
2021-06-30 19:54:16,wallstreetbets,That's what I'm thinking. The current run has been a week. A new price target of $120 was just put on the stock and I 100% believe in the company and the CEO. But I love selling and then waiting to come back down and buying back in at 20%-30% discount. The Warren Buffet on my shoulder is telling me to shut up and just hold them though.
2021-06-30 19:53:40,wallstreetbets,Treasure trail
2021-06-30 19:53:08,wallstreetbets,Oh

2021-06-30 19:18:55,wallstreetbets,It's cheap but I like a Tyson foods better. Im lazy and eat only Tyson chicken and the stock cheap therefore I buy calls and no stock.
2021-06-30 19:33:20,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre doing Q-to-Q analysis which makes no sense. That is pretty flawed to think that 2nd quarter won‚Äôt be worse then the first because of streaming alone? I don‚Äôt even need to look at the top line makeup to know you didn‚Äôt look at the 10-k and don‚Äôt know all of the revenue streams.
2021-06-30 18:55:14,wallstreetbets,Uhh read universal plus and bet then just noped tf outta the post tbh

2021-06-30 19:25:42,wallstreetbets,"Tyson is a very risky play right now due to labor shortages plus very little upside right now.

Plus it's.also one of the most hated companies tons of chicken farmers hate it and are moving to Costco farms for chicken ."

2021-06-30 18:30:38,wallstreetbets,"For history - I've always been a semi guy. Last year's peak was due to nvidia, and then the massive loss was due to amd deciding to flip earnings to the morning instead of doing them afterhours like they reported they were going to do. April's peak was nvidia, and then continuing to hold it caused me to almost lose it all. Obviously the last month was the gains from still holding it all. And then AMD is now waking up."

Edit: typo"

Still ITM so unless something awful happens tomorrow morning I should be ok. I‚Äôm going hard at renewables and NASDAQ until the tide turns. Just trying to not have most of my account in options when it finally does correct. 

If you don‚Äôt mind sharing, what ticker took you back down?

In my area there's only one KK location that I know of and they must supply to all of the supermarkets in the area. They should totally expand to smaller shops that sell coffee and stuff too.
2021-06-30 19:26:19,wallstreetbets,"Shut the fuck up pussy. Biggest name in dongers. I bet you‚Äôve never had a good donut before a day in your life
Edit: why am I being downvoted this was hilarious"
2021-06-30 19:59:02,wallstreetbets,Then why does everyone drool over their donuts? Seems like a couple easy fixes to me.
2021-06-30 19:46:05,wallstreetbets,Options are usually available one week after IPO
2021-06-30 19:27:59,wallstreetbets,"Lol KK is popular in the diabetic south,  I'll give them that."
2021-06-30 19:51:32,wallstreetbets,"Less calories than a stupid DD cake donut, bigot!"
2021-06-30 19:55:43,wallstreetbets,Things popular in the south... aren't you missing a K?

2021-06-30 18:59:42,wallstreetbets,They popped pretty late in the trading day today (aka \~2am in china). I wouldn't be surprised if we see a sizable pre-market rally when chinese traders are up to get in on it.
2021-06-30 18:10:08,wallstreetbets,Loaded to the tits with commons at $14.20. LFG!
2021-06-30 18:41:24,wallstreetbets,jacked to the tits avg @ 14.20  waiting for options for more
2021-06-30 18:21:15,wallstreetbets,"Got in at $16.30, it works in China, but not here, so I‚Äôm not worried."

2021-06-30 18:21:13,wallstreetbets,Bought some at $14.6. Long term hold for me.
2021-06-30 18:12:52,wallstreetbets,"Didi is probably the worst ride sharing company there could be. It won‚Äôt make it in America. I used Didi in Australia, the app has a poor GUI nothing near convenient as Uber makes it‚Äôs app. They don‚Äôt have a ton of drivers I spent about maybe 15 minutes waiting for a ride in Perth, Australia"

2021-06-30 19:56:28,wallstreetbets,Not trying to take any attention away but I've been spending the last couple of days doing some homework on the GRAB spac via AGC merger. Super similar play. Might grab some DIDI after I do some personal homework but I'm definitely gonna watch it as it might be a foreshadowing of what to expect with GRAB.
2021-06-30 18:09:03,wallstreetbets,6k shares at 14.32

2021-06-30 18:50:49,wallstreetbets,Using Didi in China is easy and not the same experience.  Apples to oranges. I don‚Äôt see it ever growing outside of its market of China would be its ine downside.

It can still climb if there is sufficient demand for the stock, of course, and it depends on just how many shares are getting dumped. Volume has been big the past few days, so it could be a lot of float increase. Volume on Monday and Tuesday was the same size of float from last week. Today was half that, but still a crap ton."

2021-06-30 17:21:33,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, I like the fundamental concept of this energy source. There are RNG harvesting landfills in my area, they‚Äôre growing. Aside from the deals already done with Amazon and the rest I‚Äôm certain this company is going places."
2021-06-30 17:36:42,wallstreetbets,"Very nice. Hope this helps spread the word about $CLNE and acts as a shot in the arm to the stock. Also, love the concept of harvesting methane from landfills and dairy farms to provide an alternative fuel source & reduce carbon footprints. Brilliant"
2021-06-30 17:26:12,wallstreetbets,"Even with the slow bleed, CLNE is a great company that is going to make people a lot of money with or without the ""squeeze"". Nothing has fundamentally changed in the the last two weeks just momentum traders moving to  different trades. Butttt they can easily come back and we are back preparing for a moon landing!!!! Just take a look at the open interest for the July 17 calls and tell me there is not the same if not better chance for a gamma squeeze this month when compared to June. Its telling that there has been a slow and orderly decline in share price taking the ITM calls to OTM. I am a smooth brain ape but my guess is that the Market Makers are trying to get the price as low as possible just in case there is a surge in price near the July 17 expiration date. As always CLNE LONG AND STRONG"

2021-06-30 17:30:30,wallstreetbets,"Amazon is just the tip of the.....iceberg. Think about all of the other distribution and logistics companies out there.

Last time I checked shareholders like making cash money!!!!"
2021-06-30 18:55:36,wallstreetbets,Exactly as the price of oil increase companies will see the cost benefits of transitioning to NG. RNG is great for the environment but companies are looking at one thing improvement to the bottom line and increasing profits
2021-06-30 18:15:41,wallstreetbets,"Semi trucks aka ""tractor trailers"", not like tractors you use on a farm"
2021-06-30 17:42:49,wallstreetbets,up until this point Amazon has not formally acknowledged that they will start using RNG/CNG to fuel part of their fleet

2021-06-30 18:15:03,wallstreetbets,HYLN has a future truck that will run on RNG
2021-06-30 18:16:54,wallstreetbets,Oh lol my retard brain was thinking üöú and wondering why Amazon has them. Like are they farming their own produce for Whole foods now? üòÇ
2021-06-30 17:47:59,wallstreetbets,"Yes it was and it has been for 6 months + , not trying to be negative. However I don‚Äôt want to see you lose based on this."
2021-06-30 19:12:43,wallstreetbets,No. I work on petroleum fork lifts too. They are similar to natural gas. Absolute nightmare too. Most companies already went electric with forklifts where they could afford too.
2021-06-30 18:57:35,wallstreetbets,No. NG engines in semi trucks are spark ignition engines. Not the compression ignition like diesels are. They have poor engine reliability in comparison to anything petroleum based. Amazon and other courier services may be ok with its performance. They don't expect 1 million+ miles on their equipment. Trucking will go Hydrogen or EV long term. They expect short down time with minimal maintenance issues and easy part availability.
2021-06-30 17:54:13,wallstreetbets,The deal earlier this year was announced by CLNE. On the past CC the CLNE CEO stated he couldn't say much about the deal because of disclosure agreements with Amazon. This is the first formal acknowledgment coming from the Amazon camp that they will be using RNG/CNG

2021-06-30 17:25:56,wallstreetbets,"Not sure how your individual stocks did but if you look at most index market charts for 2020, stocks dropped around March from 30% 50% in some cases and then started to go up about a month later and kept going up and up for the rest of the year, overall the market was up about 50% from where it was before COVID. So I made about 50% for the year by not selling."

2021-06-30 17:06:42,wallstreetbets,I'm not too worried. The last couple times WISH had these low volume red days. The following days volume came back and pushed WISH into the next leg up....but RIP anyones weeklies.
2021-06-30 17:05:00,wallstreetbets,"I have zero concerns about $WISH. Whether it's tomorrow, next week or next year. All you have to so is zoom out on the daily and we're still close to the fucking bottom.

2021-06-30 18:31:24,wallstreetbets,Damn man that‚Äôs solid. Are you selling covered calls against this at all?

2021-06-30 17:52:19,wallstreetbets,The fact that some guys are selling because a person who they never listen about (the CFO) resigned is very very fun

2021-06-30 17:26:01,wallstreetbets,I dont see that as a bad new (a good neither). Steve jobs died when AAPL was at USD 13... Its 136 now
2021-06-30 19:13:23,wallstreetbets,It did moon weeks ago and I sold like a true cuck
2021-06-30 19:15:37,wallstreetbets,USD 30 by EOY or before
2021-06-30 18:41:34,wallstreetbets,It's tempting. But ultimately I bought the stock because I think it could go to at least $18 and I wouldn't want to miss that upside by selling covered calls. If I did I'd probably sell calls 2 weeks out at $17. I'll see what the stock does by end of week and then decide.
2021-06-30 19:01:00,wallstreetbets,Covered calls work well when the stock is going parabolic. Wait for it... I usually sell calls when V.I. is ridicously high
2021-06-30 17:53:05,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, just rofl and hold"
2021-06-30 17:39:57,wallstreetbets,Too much CCP involvement makes it too risky for me
2021-06-30 17:43:24,wallstreetbets,"True, more of a heads up. If they get a good CFO to take over in the coming months things can change pretty quickly"
2021-06-30 19:03:45,wallstreetbets,"And that's $136 *after* a couple of splits (a 4:1 and a 7:1). So we're really comparing that $13 to $3,808 (4 x 7 x 136)"
2021-06-30 19:35:53,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve been selling weekly covered calls at $20 and $21 strike price and premium is still so yummy. I think it will go over $20 for sure but I bought at ~$11 so $20 is good enough for me
2021-06-30 17:54:34,wallstreetbets,"I respect all the opnions, I dont care abouth good or bad comments. Even more, bad comments sometimes highlight facts that I dont know...

But I hope you are wrong! hahahah"
2021-06-30 17:56:08,wallstreetbets,"I hope I am wrong too.  Fundamentally, wish is a strong stock, if CCP isn‚Äôt bullshitting their data.

If they get the traffic, they can easily be 30-50 in a year or two."
2021-06-30 17:58:53,wallstreetbets,"I searched on Google what CCP means (maybe you could see I'm not a good english speaker) and I couldn't understrand the relation with Wish

Can you explain please? Really thanks"
2021-06-30 18:03:51,wallstreetbets,"CCP is the Chinese communist party.  They quasi owns every companies from China or operating in China.

Baba took a bloody dip when Jack Ma called the Chinese president something rather bad.

The examples goes on and on, geopolitical tensions could also seriously wreck the stock."
2021-06-30 18:11:49,wallstreetbets,"I got it now.... I looked for ""CCP Investopedia"" and there was a post about ""Central Counterparty ClearingHouse""

Abou your point, Wish is based in San Francisco, is not a chinese company. Even more, was founded by ex Google and Yahoo workers, who thought that the future of ecommerce is on smartphones and not the computer.

Wish Sellers are mainly based in China. But I dont think that CCP will ban a platform that help us to export products"

2021-06-30 17:09:36,wallstreetbets,Said it during the earnings call due to high cost of operation
2021-06-30 17:09:51,wallstreetbets,The plant is better suited to make logic based chips over memory chips. So it makes sense
2021-06-30 16:58:21,wallstreetbets,It's not tanking it's down 1% after hours after a 3% run up today.
2021-06-30 16:43:35,wallstreetbets,Price is tanking cuz all you fuking retard brought a shit load of calls.
2021-06-30 18:05:31,wallstreetbets,This earning call is muted because MU already rallied before call and nfp coming this Friday. You have to wait one or 2 weeks
2021-06-30 16:44:56,wallstreetbets,"Because stock price was already up based on expectations that earnings would be high. Those were met. Now stock price reflects possibility of future earnings being lower due to something unexpected.

Or at least that's the typical explanation, but I'm dumb."
2021-06-30 17:02:54,wallstreetbets,"Buy the rumor, sell the news. It was all priced in already."
2021-06-30 17:23:29,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, maybe not. We still got time."
2021-06-30 17:46:10,wallstreetbets,Options aren't possible to trade after hours?
2021-06-30 17:32:42,wallstreetbets,"Ta mate.    
Earnings good. Might trade flat for a bit I guess and then upwards I gues"
2021-06-30 16:45:50,wallstreetbets,Except they didn't dumbass. Call volume only went up like 2.4%
2021-06-30 16:58:29,wallstreetbets,LMFAO ngl real stuff.
2021-06-30 17:21:11,wallstreetbets,"There are a lot of MU posts today and two between Monday and Tuesday, both of which had about a twenty comments. Excluding this week, I only see one or two posts in the past three months. I doubt many people in here jumped on MU calls."
2021-06-30 18:45:28,wallstreetbets,"That's true, but on the other hand they beat expectations by 10%. Anyway this is just after-hours trading, I'm interested in seeing how it will trade tomorrow."
2021-06-30 17:04:18,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but why does Nike, BBBY, and other stocks jump immediately after earnings üòí"

2021-06-30 19:24:30,wallstreetbets,Not all people here buy based off of what the WSB shills and retarded echo chambers pump
2021-06-30 17:45:35,wallstreetbets,"Micron is going to 100 within a year. Probably 110.    
Guidance will be raised over the next week or so across the board.    
Might not see movement upwards this week tho.    
Also the jobs report on Friday will probably mean volume is lowish tomorrow which isn't great considering insiders will probably be profit taking"

2021-06-30 17:55:44,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the insight, probably going to sell everything at open and take the small gains/losses on this as a lesson learned."
2021-06-30 16:51:41,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs gonna go up by the end of the week if I sell my calls tomorrow
2021-06-30 17:25:24,wallstreetbets,"I brought my calls last week, I should still be up by tomorrow morning. Just didn‚Äôt get the 10x I was looking for"

2021-06-30 18:22:25,wallstreetbets,Roku is a good stock
2021-06-30 16:29:32,wallstreetbets,Dang I just got puts on roku at close. It went parabolic last 2 weeks. Due for a pullback.
2021-06-30 16:36:33,wallstreetbets,They went up today because  Apple bought Roku remote control button.
2021-06-30 19:02:27,wallstreetbets,ROKU isn‚Äôt even at ATHs but I do get nervous with my call options bc we haven‚Äôt had a red day in almost 2 weeks lol still going strong. I agree with the comment about not fighting momentum. Bears been getting dragged or scalping pennies off this run up. My call options love when they cover tho
2021-06-30 17:00:38,wallstreetbets,‚ÄòIt went up too much‚Äô has got to be one of the most money-losing rationales of all time. Momentum is all that matters for short term options and you are throwing your $ against it like some kind of retarded Superman trying to stop a runaway train. Good luck.
2021-06-30 16:45:25,wallstreetbets,But they unveiled this in April lol
2021-06-30 17:13:28,wallstreetbets,LOL a $50B company climbed more than 35% in 14 days. Tell what stock didn‚Äôt have some sort of  pullback. I‚Äôll take my chances thx.

2021-06-30 17:30:47,wallstreetbets,"They all pull back at some point, but WHEN is the question. You‚Äôre just deciding it went up ‚Äòtoo much‚Äô and throwing your money at it instead of waiting for the price action to weaken.

Idk exactly how many times I had to try this before I realized the market didn‚Äôt give a shit what I thought was ‚Äòtoo much‚Äô.

Yeah you may scalp some $ tomorrow. No one knows. But if you try doing nothing but these ‚Äòshort the overbought runner‚Äô plays you will blow up your account before long. Be like OP - follow momentum, take the easy trades."

2021-06-30 17:32:29,wallstreetbets,"A lot of things could happen. This seriously sounds like a pretty decent expectation considering how school buses are used normally. This could be harder since such decisions are often made by a group, as more than half of the schools are public. And there is also the fear of edge cases - [https://medium.com/dayone-a-new-perspective/how-the-fear-of-edge-cases-kills-ideas-71413a2ff59d](https://medium.com/dayone-a-new-perspective/how-the-fear-of-edge-cases-kills-ideas-71413a2ff59d) .

2021-06-30 16:14:39,wallstreetbets,"LET'S FUCKING GO, they absolutely smashed EPS, Rev, and guidance estimates. That's big fucking money. I was in for 1200 shares, and now im taking an investing break like a goddamn king after this lol. Excited to see it smash $90 tomorrow (just my prediction), then I'll take my profits and rest easy.

Micron Technology (MU) reported 3rd Quarter May 2021 earnings of $1.88 per share. The consensus earnings estimate was $1.72 per share on revenue of $7.2 billion. The Earnings Whisper number was $1.78 per share.

The company said it expects fourth quarter earnings of $2.20 to $2.40 per share on revenue of $8.00 billion to $8.40 billion. The current consensus earnings estimate is $2.02 per share on revenue of $7.85 billion for the quarter ending August 31, 2021.

‚ÄúMicron set multiple market and product revenue records in our third quarter and achieved the largest sequential earnings improvement in our history,‚Äù said Micron Technology President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. ‚ÄúOur industry-leading 1a DRAM and 176-layer NAND now represent a meaningful portion of our production, and Micron is in the best position ever to capitalize on the long-term demand trends across the data center, intelligent edge and user devices.‚Äù

\[insert rocket emojis x100 here\]

EDIT: Looks like the market disagrees! MU also said it was selling off one of its plants, and I think that has investors scared about their ability to continue as they have, despite MU's raising of next quarter's guidance. Only about 100K volume in AH though. We'll see what happens tomorrow morning."
2021-06-30 16:10:35,wallstreetbets,What the hell is going on with after hours stock price on MU?

2021-06-30 16:22:09,wallstreetbets,"god knows what is going on in AH. First a dump and then some buys to end up nearly flat with with closing price. 

Nice to hear they lined up ASML for EUV tech in the pipeline. Wonder if they will be able to use their knowhow from DUV (at 14nm) to EUV to maintain technological advantage. 

Guidance has gone up and margin as expected has shot up from 40.5% to 46%. 

I read this all as fantastic news but I guess we find out tomorrow."
2021-06-30 16:54:47,wallstreetbets,Why are they holding so much cash. Wonder if they are planning an acquisition?
2021-06-30 17:42:59,wallstreetbets,Fuck it send in some 90calls anyways
2021-06-30 16:41:14,wallstreetbets,Bought it when it was at mid price today. Yaya. Like what I heard after hour today.

2021-06-30 17:02:13,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I think this week might hold here to ruin options holders.    
Maybe see a move next week depending on the jobs report Friday.    
I've calls and shares myself but they're fine.    
If this dips not related to jobs report I'll buy in 2x more actually. This is a no brainer stock right now."

Highly unlikely."

Looks like a beat tho.    
Stocks gonna yoyo until midway through earnings call when they say what the future will bring imo."

2021-06-30 16:59:08,wallstreetbets,"This is not correct. Micron employs 40K people globally, most of which are not in Boise. And the SE Idaho metro area is closer to 750K people."

2021-06-30 16:55:53,wallstreetbets,"That's because he's wrong. Micron employs 40k people globally, the majority of which do not work in Boise. Also Boise may be around 240K but the metropolitan area it exists in is closer to 750K."
2021-06-30 17:03:22,wallstreetbets,You are correct my friend. I was just using the capital pop as a general reference. This company is very valuable to that area of Idaho.

This is a long position, and it hasn't hit bottom yet. At best you're going to trade sideways for a few weeks."

2021-06-30 17:00:31,wallstreetbets,"CLNE may be losing hype for now, but I‚Äôm glad it has shown itself or else I wouldn‚Äôt have known about such an amazing long term hold GOLD MINE of a stock, and I don‚Äôt know why ANYONE would be losing faith in this stock.

What CLNE plans to do for literally the next decade is insane. I won‚Äôt be surprised if CLNE is a 100$+ company soon, probably even some time next year. 

More and more companies are taking apart of CLNE RNG fuel systems, including just recently CMI (Cummins Engines) is now going to be running on RNG fuel systems! [Link here. ](https://mobile.twitter.com/A_Littlefair/status/1409943678190186498)

Not to mention the big one we already know about is AMZN and how they have HEAVILY bought into CLNE for long term holding, and they‚Äôve already purchased HUNDREDS of cargo trucks for Amazons fleet that run on CLNE RNG fuel systems. The trucks have already been rolled out and are being spotted! Also, big BP insights! [Link here. ](https://mobile.twitter.com/A_Littlefair/status/1407450106060697600)


Today was an AMAZING share buying day for CLNE and it‚Äôll continue to be amazing even from 9-10$ range! I‚Äôll keep buying the dip and the ask!

AS FOR ME, I LIKE THE STOCK!!! COWS UNITE!!! üêÑüêÑüêÑüêÑüêÑüêÑü•Ç

Edit: I just wanna add one more thought, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if more and more car company‚Äôs partner with CLNE. CLNE RNG fuel is the future. üåç"
2021-06-30 18:24:17,wallstreetbets,"**Boeing $BA is a $300 stock.**

Did you know that Boeing has a **4,041 order backlog** for its planes? That is around **$800 BILLION** in revenue already locked in!

They can easily deliver over 800 planes per year. 

If you add service and educational contracts that's easily over $1 Trillion in revenue for Boeing already guaranteed. 

Boeing is a $300 stock even if they get 0 orders for planes for 5 years. This is no yolo play this is a solid boomer retirement juggernaut.

They're expensive for consumers, their workers are underpaid, they gouge restaurants, and in spite of it all they still lose money. Seems like they're banking on an Amazon-style market share play until they can just force out all of their competition, but I'm not a believer. I think they coasted on a strong labor market where people had to take gig jobs because there wasn't anything else out there. Now there's a labor shortage and Uber can't properly compensate people without pricing themselves out of business.

I'll probably be wrong this go-around, but I really think their share price is gonna be in the shitter some time within the next couple of years."

The company also sold about $1.68 billion in stock at market prices, turned over its board, and eliminated long-term debt from its balance sheet, aside from $445 million in lease obligations that are classified as long-term debt for accounting purposes.

I still own GME, but this pisses me off.

2021-06-30 16:37:30,wallstreetbets,"Check out this story in Barron's.

GameStop began the year with nine analysts covering the stock. Now only three remain with ratings after an analyst suspended his target, pointing his finger at social media and other nonfundamental factors that are moving the stock.

Baird analyst Colin Sebastian discussed the reasoning behind his decision in a note on Monday. He told clients that he is putting his Neutral rating and $25 price target on hold until management details its new business strategy so analysts can better forecast free cash-flow generation and assess intrinsic value.

Sebastian wrote that he recognized that GameStop (ticker: GME) is shifting rapidly from in-store videogame sales to e-commerce, but that he believes ‚Äúshare price volatility is tied more closely to non-fundamental trading, social media influences and other factors that make it difficult, at least in the near term, to make a reasonable stock rating recommendation to institutional investors.‚Äù

2021-06-30 17:35:02,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs called a poor mans covered call. The risk is if the strip increases in volatility higher in the near term than in the later months. It‚Äôs better than a covered call because you need less capital and for that privilege you pay a premium and it‚Äôs worse because your leap still has an expiry and nobody knows what it‚Äôll look like a couple months from expiry. You share the most common risk with covered calls of something moving down in price and the premium becoming pennies.

You get rewarded for the risk you take, you cap your upside and get lower volatility."

I'm not going to be running the only reason I'm capping my upside is because of interest rate risk and potential black swan. Just debating if its better to just buy the shares out right.
2021-06-30 17:40:02,wallstreetbets,yeah i just am debating if its better than just buying the shares out right.

2021-06-30 15:58:45,wallstreetbets,When you like dips a little too much
2021-06-30 18:11:18,wallstreetbets,Now THIS is a yolo lets fucking goooooo
2021-06-30 15:58:52,wallstreetbets,R.I.P your money
2021-06-30 17:47:55,wallstreetbets,Still you have 2 days left
2021-06-30 16:24:28,wallstreetbets,Back to basics I see.
2021-06-30 17:25:24,wallstreetbets,I got some 07/02 30C‚Äôs for .02 each. Godspeed fellow palantard
2021-06-30 17:31:09,wallstreetbets,godspeed and i wish you tendies
2021-06-30 19:38:15,wallstreetbets,"Lol at the people telling you what you should have done that probably have 100 shares.  Also, it seems PLTR does decent on fridays and have announced contracts/renewals on fridays.  Love the bet.  I loaded up on $30c every week through 8/20."
2021-06-30 15:59:13,wallstreetbets,Should have bought shares.
2021-06-30 16:14:57,wallstreetbets,I sold 250 of these to you
2021-06-30 19:23:08,wallstreetbets,Cathie (ArkW) selling 710k shares. Whats your take here?
2021-06-30 16:35:58,wallstreetbets,Remind Me! July 3 to revisit this post
2021-06-30 17:53:04,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this was dumb. PLTR can move fast but it‚Äôs been on a slow trajectory to the 27s, it then has a pullback since some people are taking profits. We may not see 27s again for several weeks. I‚Äôm long on Palantir shares"
2021-06-30 19:43:03,wallstreetbets,I like PLTR but not your YOLO!
2021-06-30 18:30:01,wallstreetbets,Damn I‚Äôd sell cut the loss buy shares. True crayon eater

2021-06-30 16:15:47,wallstreetbets,Nice doing business. I‚Äôll gladly take those gains off your hands üòé
2021-06-30 19:26:08,wallstreetbets,"None at all. I didn‚Äôt buy shares in Palantir because of Ark, and I won‚Äôt sell either. Additionally, she sold less than 1/3 of 1 percent of her holdings. Meaningless trimming of winners to add to her losers or new positions. And besides, if we want to look at short term buy/sell orders I‚Äôd tell you to take a look at a 3.5 million block order that just went through in the dark pools after hours. That was much more interesting to me than what Cathie did."
2021-06-30 17:54:08,wallstreetbets,"And then again we may see it tomorrow. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a BET. Also, I own shares so I‚Äôm long in all scenarios."
2021-06-30 16:00:09,wallstreetbets,Should buy more!
2021-06-30 16:45:13,wallstreetbets,You have 20k shares of pltr? This ain't no yolo then it's worth like 2% of that position
2021-06-30 16:05:14,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt speak none too good. 

This ain‚Äôt English class. Me dumb. Not smart."
2021-06-30 16:18:42,wallstreetbets,"If there‚Äôs a big tech day tomorrow, hats off to you because you‚Äôll deserve the HUGE GAINZ. That‚Äôs the only thing that can make this go tits up, because partnerships and new contracts hardly make a dent with this forsaken stock."
2021-06-30 17:57:04,wallstreetbets,Godspeed to ya
2021-06-30 16:00:37,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre absolutely right
2021-06-30 16:46:13,wallstreetbets,A 20k OTM position expiring in less than 2 days is considered a YOLO. Welcome to WSB
2021-06-30 16:33:46,wallstreetbets,Don't people come here to learn though? No reason to stop learning just because class is over.
2021-06-30 16:23:18,wallstreetbets,As a long shareholder I agree with that. Thankfully I bought shares heavily on that earnings morning dip below 18.
2021-06-30 16:03:02,wallstreetbets,Sadly I think your calls are toast for tomorrow.
2021-06-30 16:56:03,wallstreetbets,Nope. Learning is for losers
2021-06-30 16:04:50,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm banking on a big tech day to start off the quarter. If that doesn‚Äôt happen I‚Äôll prob sell at open to retain some equity and add it to my ITM long dated.
2021-06-30 18:52:13,wallstreetbets,Wendy says I dont gots to lern
2021-06-30 16:12:23,wallstreetbets,Good luck. Hope it hits so you can buy more shares!
2021-06-30 16:58:17,wallstreetbets,"Well,  some of my positions, I was loosing money, waited until stock goes up and close the positions to reduce my loss.  It's hard to do but better to loose $40 instead of $200 for example."

My father in law will work 4 Tesla and is getting some shares. Would be a great present if this would be buyable"
2021-06-30 16:10:50,wallstreetbets,Cool would be if you can track the chart over the day or on your own baseline.  Here you can see you chart   If it is positiv (green) and negativ (red) only by locking to this nice thing. Maybe you can use the brightness for the percentage volume or price of the stock.

2021-06-30 17:55:38,wallstreetbets,Yeah sadly they don‚Äôt usually go straight up. But from a charting perspective it still looks like a very good set up. I‚Äôm still very bullish on $WISH

proceed with caution"

2021-06-30 17:05:40,wallstreetbets,She will if you own wish
2021-06-30 18:00:50,wallstreetbets,"Market cap 8.15B, Sales revenue 2.54B in 2020 (33% growth), gross income 1.59B (9.33% growth) compared to shopify in the ecommerce segment you can make the argument this company is undervalued. Granted, hard to compare wish with shopify but don‚Äôt overlook their partnership with PrestaShop (over 300,000 brands will have access to wish customers from this deal)"
2021-06-30 16:04:32,wallstreetbets,Could‚Äôve been worse. Consolidated from yesterday. As long as people don‚Äôt panic we are good. A lot of red today in all the WSB stocks. üöÄüöÄ
2021-06-30 16:15:50,wallstreetbets,It's consolidating.
2021-06-30 18:58:44,wallstreetbets,To each their own but i would srsly recommend looking into their financials
2021-06-30 19:46:05,wallstreetbets,That's because it is ü§î

2021-06-30 18:05:11,wallstreetbets,"I've personally bought some things from wish, but not one of my experiences have had me thinking i would buy from them again. I keep thinking well maybe that was a one off so I'll try again. Maybe things have changed on there, but i won't be trying my luck with them again. Products are cheap as they can be, and shipping anything from there is ridiculous. They got a long way to come still to be valued with any kind of real opportunity..."
2021-06-30 18:11:37,wallstreetbets,Cause it's getting ready to be $GME day soon I feel
2021-06-30 16:30:00,wallstreetbets,Isn‚Äôt that a bad thing for those who don‚Äôt like to be bag holders?
2021-06-30 19:48:40,wallstreetbets,"Aye but out of fear of the down votes, you've got to add the :/ face ;)"
2021-06-30 16:41:44,wallstreetbets,"Probably nothing specific. But its not the craziest Idea that after a couple meme stocks fucked smart money shorts up the ass, that there would be some kind of action to dilute the collective buying power of redditors and retail investors as a whole. Its not that farfetched to imagine them promoting and pushing redditors towards multiple pump and dump tickers at once in an attempt to burn them and turn them off from meme investing in the future. Or at least to keep the collective from consolidating around one ticker like they did GME and having it spiral out of their control again.

Im not saying I believe in all the conspiracy shit AMC/GME fanboys swear by, only that the idea of this stuff isnt all that farfetched. Its plausible, and some of it to a degree... not unlikely."
2021-06-30 16:08:19,wallstreetbets,Your dreaming at a squeeze that never existed...
2021-06-30 18:32:53,wallstreetbets,">falling wedge

well in daily patterns its close to rising wedge, but in 4hr patterns its close to falling wedge still failed with todays deep, im going with daily patterns anyway."
2021-06-30 16:32:33,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll turn water into wine if it hits $15
2021-06-30 18:17:02,wallstreetbets,Well I saved it for a day you won‚Äôt remember.
2021-06-30 18:10:25,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs where I think the PrestaShop deal comes into play, the argument has always been that products from wish are cheap & garbage (entirely reasonable) but this deal allows for a broader selection of merchants for consumers to choose from. I think qc will help get somewhat resolved through this deal but i completely agree this is very forward thinking and the company still has a lot of places of where it must execute to justify a rally in its price"
2021-06-30 17:38:12,wallstreetbets,"Wish wont fail, because its backed by China."
2021-06-30 19:58:30,wallstreetbets,We need not fear downvotes from the bots and interns. Gotta stay strong with üíéü§≤ on the üöÄüåñ
2021-06-30 19:01:42,wallstreetbets,The thought has crossed my mind as well. I‚Äôm not 100% sure they are distracting us from any certain stock but instead dividing us over many if that makes sense.
2021-06-30 18:02:07,wallstreetbets,"Understanding, was hoping it could go up at least a little bit"
2021-06-30 19:55:42,wallstreetbets,And turn bread into dust if it doesn‚Äôt.
2021-06-30 18:33:48,wallstreetbets,"The downside is they've gotten this reputation, and have had it for some time now. It's gonna take allot of work to get thru this mindset people have for then to start shopping there again. Personally in gonna have to see allot of positive reviews to get beyond thinking the reviews are fakes. Why i can't bring myself into adding money in there stock meme or not i just can't see it. Hope the best for everyone playing in their stock though!!! Make that money!!!"
2021-06-30 18:04:50,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt think anyone is making that claim. The question is will it spend a day above $15 before September.
2021-06-30 18:43:46,wallstreetbets,Before September ?! Lol that‚Äôs pretty reasonable... most apes don‚Äôt think passed EOW. Anyways I‚Äôm bullish as fuck on wish.

The new Chinese owners have turned the site into an Aliexpress hustling bucks on shipping and other shady dealings. I will not buy form them again, I'm not alone if one looks at the Newegg subredditl. I'm pleased as punch I didn't let their new business practice give me paper hands."

The onlyway to get one at MSRP is to do the ""Newegg shuffle"", that's another scheme the new owners introduced.  Something is odd about the rocket to the moon, if it isn't the apes then the Street likes the new hustle a buck owners.

So you say diamond hands and not to take the money and run? That Kenny Rodgers' song keeps running through my head, you gott'a know when to hold'em, you gott'a know when to fold'em. My son went in on NEGG on May 20 too, at  my suggestion. He keeps asking me  what to do; it was he who found this post. Both of us were searching for WHY."

2021-06-30 15:24:01,wallstreetbets,"Yup, on the way up I cashed out cost plus a little extra at $45 and $66.69. Still holding some but waiting for a pop to $69. 

Had a limit order set and I wasn't paying attention the day it was climbing or I would have moved the $45 higher."
2021-06-30 15:18:34,wallstreetbets,AMC is a 30b company now. It‚Äôs going to take a lot of buying pressure to go higher. Do you really think it could go to 100b?
2021-06-30 15:20:01,wallstreetbets,A stock is as valuable as people want it to be. I'll just leave it at that.
2021-06-30 15:28:12,wallstreetbets,"Netflix has a 235B market cap, so AMC 100B is definitely not out of the picture. Two different companies, but still"

2021-06-30 19:39:46,wallstreetbets,Fuck yeah that‚Äôs some quick and good money. Not worth the risk. I got stuck holding stock because I‚Äôm out of day trades but the price seems to be steady so far after hours.

2021-06-30 15:11:03,wallstreetbets,"Good luck. It‚Äôd be nice to see some positive PR. A week without news has caused a slump. There seems to be a lot of selling into any uptick. Stock jumps from 13.18 to 13.24 for example, and then a block sale comes in and takes out the .23 bid.

2021-06-30 14:58:44,wallstreetbets,Good luck!
2021-06-30 16:09:38,wallstreetbets,"Update: Revenues, EPS, and guidance all beat estimates. Let's see if the market understands that.... :P"
2021-06-30 14:51:46,wallstreetbets,Remember when a yolo was options only?
2021-06-30 19:16:51,wallstreetbets,"Appreciate you buying shares. Im 14k in calls, would love to see 90 by the 16th"
2021-06-30 18:34:21,wallstreetbets,I have YOLOd on a previous thread. $MU to the Muoon! üêÑ üöÄüåô
2021-06-30 17:58:25,wallstreetbets,"Yeah Its hard to know. I think market will be generally red tomorrow waiting for Fridays report.     
So it will drag MU. Also insider selling probably be an increase in volume to the downside.    

We should see some updated PT tomorrow and Friday tho. Most analysts can quickly update their dcf with the new figures.    
This should be raises all around by 10%    
If this dips it's a buy opportunity for me. Anywhere below 80 right now and I'll double up what I have in it"
2021-06-30 14:57:12,wallstreetbets,"I think when you shake $100K at any stock, in any way, that's a fucking YOLO and a half."
2021-06-30 18:29:54,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm in deep so, I‚Äôm just going to hold. I have faith"
2021-06-30 15:27:41,wallstreetbets,"But why? I'm in on MU a little, but is it really that much of a YOLO? Average PT is like 120 and it's sitting below 85. Holding for a year and you're likely to come out with 20k ish.

Someone yoloing 10k on ITM options could see 200% returns in 2 weeks. But they could also lose 10k just like that. You're likely to not lose any money here."
2021-06-30 19:02:10,wallstreetbets,Yup same. Will probably be down 20% tomorrow looking at current price action but I'll keep it. Was already up like 30% so overall still positive and confident this company is going places.
2021-06-30 15:32:05,wallstreetbets,"If you‚Äôre thinking of holding shares for a rolling average over many years and willing to exclude issues like the tech bubble and potential looming market crash and delta variant COVID rocking foreign markets potentially making its way here, yeah it‚Äôs pretty safe.  But no, having said that, if any of those things come to fruition I‚Äôd be locked in for years praying this stock ever climbs back to where it is today. It‚Äôs not just a huge amount of time to be separated from these funds, it‚Äôs increasingly unlikely given the dips we may see in the not-so-far future. Just my two cents, but hey man, if you have the risk tolerance to sling 100k in options, post a pic and I‚Äôll follow your progress."
2021-06-30 16:35:53,wallstreetbets,"It combines the net worth to the person and the risk. I don't think any company with stable shares could ever be considered a YOLO holding just shares. 

YOLO is taking 50% or more of your net worth and tossing it into FDs"

No broker can force someone to take the other side of your trade. If you're not getting a fill, try a bid a little closer to the ask. If you fat finger a buy order... how is your broker supposed to know that? Do you want them to force you to spend more time with additional approvals before you can trade?

2021-06-30 14:23:24,wallstreetbets,How you going generate the power?  Storing it isn‚Äôt an issue. It‚Äôs generating the power needed for the people.
2021-06-30 14:24:23,wallstreetbets,"Interesting indeed. And I don‚Äôt get the AutoBot. If Tesla is in the market for state-wide energy storage solutions then that is big money for the second life of the cars‚Äô batteries. 

First units must be failing right now with 8 years on the road. So a lot of battery packs waiting for reuse in storage solutions."

2021-06-30 15:16:42,wallstreetbets,For sureee. That‚Äôs gotta low key been the plan
2021-06-30 16:40:20,wallstreetbets,"Power plants have a peak efficiency range where you get the most energy out of each gallon of fuel, so at times of reduced demand you run the power plant at its peak efficiency and charge the battery.

In any case, these batteries are likely going to be used for very short periods of time, mainly to smooth out power delivery and to avoid surges or short periods of excess demand from overloading the system and keeping costs down (e.g. in Australia they have had tremendous success with this).

As you look down the road, solar roofs and home batteries will be an increasing part of local power supply, with power plants charging grid batteries as a backup for periods when solar and home batteries are insufficient (maybe one day if batteries or other storage mediums are plentiful enough, you can have solar farms storing power in them for extended periods of use as needed). Home batteries, are better in terms of resilience of the grid as you minimize transmission issues, however installing 140 mWh's in home batteries is going to be much more costly than a centralized battery."
2021-06-30 14:30:44,wallstreetbets,"It is an issue. You want to store energy at off-peak times, then use it during peak times."
2021-06-30 15:47:50,wallstreetbets,No‚Ä¶ very few packs are ‚Äúfailing‚Äù
2021-06-30 16:45:48,wallstreetbets,"Yea we still need to break through the utility grip on the grid. Where I live you cannot sell back onto the grid as a resident. 

But, once EV really takes off there will not be enough generation, especially as large projects like Hydro dams get harder to build, which are by far the best clean source, so I see home solar and battery will begin to be heavily pushed as EVs ramp up."
2021-06-30 16:42:05,wallstreetbets,"Solar roof and battery packs isn‚Äôt new tech. 

Please do your due diligence. Just because Tesla slaps a name on them doesn‚Äôt mean they invented the wheel.

You can‚Äôt get off the grid 100% in California and they also Jack the hell out of your rates if your demand curve is below average because of your location. 

Frankly, I don‚Äôt know many poor neighborhoods have battery pack or solar roof ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and the richer neighborhoods pay through their nose in electricity tiers.  Unless of course you scam them. Just go check out pge reduce your bill options ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Know plenty that get subsidized scamming"
2021-06-30 14:39:41,wallstreetbets,"Again, the problem isn‚Äôt storage. The problem is generating. 

Creating another problem such as storage will only add to the overhead. The long term Maintanance and replacements cost a lot more than generating more power from different sources."
2021-06-30 18:20:09,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs just a matter of time. And it‚Äôs great to see Tesla going all in on second life. üòÄ
2021-06-30 17:01:25,wallstreetbets,"Hydro storage is great where it works, but the locations are limited, also you need batteries to smooth out power delivery in any case, so going to be ton of demand for a long time for batteries here."
2021-06-30 17:16:33,wallstreetbets,"Neither are EV's nor rockets new, yet EV's before Elon were garbage and no one wanted to buy them or make them, and rockets before Elon were too expensive.

I am not going to bother with the rest here, as you clearly have a mission to mock and put down anything and everything associated with Elon Musk. IMO, he will be remembered up there with Einstein and Edison for his contributions to humanity. You and your TSLAQ friends will be remembered in a footnote about a bitter group of people that lost their money betting against the future."
2021-06-30 14:43:13,wallstreetbets,"If they already had the storage to meet peak demand, then why would they get batteries? Off peak energy use reduces costs

Also, it‚Äôs coming from SoCal Edison, which would use a variety of sources, including solar and wind."
2021-06-30 17:22:07,wallstreetbets,"Dude. Solarcity was failing and Elon bailed out his brother. Please look at the case on this. 

Secondly, Tesla was already started long before musk took over.  Their battery tech isn‚Äôt much different than competitors. They just got a lot of billions from selling shares and IPO to make that leap that most automakers can‚Äôt. 

You want to talk about money. Tesla doesn‚Äôt let their workers unionized because they know they‚Äôll spend billions more paying their workers auto industry standard wages. 

Anyways, you know nothing about Tesla internal. All you see his hype and that‚Äôs it."
2021-06-30 14:50:47,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs because off peak is a scam. Their solar generation isn‚Äôt that much and wind hasn‚Äôt been a factor.  

You think the nuke plant going to keep churning when the state govt doesn‚Äôt want it to go full load?  

Think before you talk‚Ä¶."
2021-06-30 15:16:27,wallstreetbets,"No matter what part of their generation mix is used to charge them, as long as there is enough capacity to offset the peaker plant then it's a valid use case.

If you think on and off peak is a scam, research what happens to your assets when you aren't maintaining 60 hz."
2021-06-30 16:45:38,wallstreetbets,"Seems people actually in the business want these batteries and it saves them significant money.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornsdale\_Power\_Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornsdale_Power_Reserve)

But yeah, why not go on about things you clearly have no clue what you are talking about."
2021-06-30 15:11:57,wallstreetbets,it's funny that all the 'go-green- people are also anti nuke... it's literally the cleanest and most efficient power source readily available to humans since electricity was able to be harnessed. just a few dozen nuclear plants could power the entire US for decades without a single molecule of CO or carcinogens being released. if we had nuclear plants every few states just running a AC grid to power EV's we could virtually remove carbon emissions from vehicles in less than 20 years.
2021-06-30 15:32:52,wallstreetbets,"Basic use case?  Is that liberal lingo for spending someone else‚Äôs money who cares? ü§£ü§£ü§£

Let me break it down to you in liberal term. The reason big tech stopped going green because it‚Äôs not financially feasible but they have not problem selling it to stupid people because it‚Äôs their tax money. 

Get it now?"
2021-06-30 16:46:40,wallstreetbets,"Oh I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶

Y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt even know Apple and big tech backing off on the solar farms ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2021-06-30 15:14:57,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs also amazing that solar and wind generation has been net zero for decades. 

In fact, big tech like Apple, Google and Facebook backing out of solar farms because it‚Äôs a huge money sink that gains no value ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

People aren‚Äôt bright. They dumb to be fed what politicians and so called scam artists will feed them. 

Hey I got some eco friendly bridges for sale."
2021-06-30 15:43:08,wallstreetbets,"It's not political but have fun trying to make a flamewar out of it if you like. Out of phase energy stresses hardware which increases failure rates and takes out more shit as a result. Ask texas how well that worked for them in Feb

Beyond that, your uninformed opinion doesn't merit further response. Cheers and gfy fellow retard."
2021-06-30 17:34:17,wallstreetbets,Big tech stopped going green? What are you talking about?
2021-06-30 17:06:33,wallstreetbets,"Every place that talks about Apple and big tech and energy is saying they are pursuing solar and batteries to help with supplying power for their operations. But you apparently say otherwise. Pretty interesting.

You are literally just making up stuff. Seriously, you sound delusional."
2021-06-30 15:22:45,wallstreetbets,"Solar is a scam. The materials used to create the batteries in solar panels are unbelievably toxic, and they take years on years to even get a break-even point from their cost standpoint. Nuclear power can power entire grids for cents a day with virtually no toxic emissions, but people cry and complain and make up reasons to be afraid of them. Everyone thinks every single power plant will be the next Chernobyl but that was a once in a lifetime mistake that will never happen again; the resulting fallout from that said meltdown is still nowhere close to the damage done every year by the acids and toxic chemicals used to create solar batteries. But ignorance is bliss."
2021-06-30 17:08:58,wallstreetbets,"Talk and do much different. You haven‚Äôt learnt about PR‚Ä¶.

2021-06-30 15:10:03,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs a whack title then
2021-06-30 15:25:51,wallstreetbets,Try that same test again at a rainy or snow day. Vision models are worse in that scenario.
2021-06-30 16:57:41,wallstreetbets,"You make a fundamentally flawed statement. If vision is not sufficient for driving in rain or snow the car should not be driving. As long as we can use vision a computer can use vision (and maybe beyond that). It just needs the right vision sensors and the right computing hardware and software to enable it. So, if vision is a viable method of seeing the world, then combining it with radar will always be worse, not better. If you are not sure, watch the video of Andrej Karpathy explaining this stuff."
2021-06-30 17:01:05,wallstreetbets,"You are talking theory, I'm stating reality. Latest Model 3s are worse in rain and snow. Don't make it better than it is.

The reality is that Tesla couldn't buy enough radar hardware, because of A. chip shortage and B. cost savings. Just like they dropped the lumbar support. Not because of superiority of one over the other. 

Funny thing, Apple said the same thing when they dropped TouchId in favour of FaceId. They said FaceId is better back then. If that was the case why are they returning it? 

Learn to read between the lines. 

Lets hope this decision of Tesla will be a win for vision because they are putting a lot of r&d focus on it now. Until then it's not there on par with radar. The reality now is that people are receiving a worse product with a higher pricetag than before. 

We can discuss it all day, but the reality is that they replaced it with a mediocre solution."
2021-06-30 17:29:34,wallstreetbets,"You just stated your theory or opinion that Tesla could not get radar due to chip shortages. But whatever.

In any case it is the new software that improves the vision processing, so you can't compare to performance before."
2021-06-30 18:57:13,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre using wrong hyperboles to validate your theory‚Ä¶ eg Apple is dropping Face ID because we‚Äôre first and foremost in global pandemic that will last years and with masks Face ID is shit‚Ä¶
2021-06-30 17:52:39,wallstreetbets,"Just ask yourself: would it make sense to drop something superior from something inferior?

The state of now is the only thing that counts right now. And now reality is that the implementation with radar is better than vision.

All this ""oh, it's just the software that is lacking"" is not a valid reason. It's a vehicle with lives at stake. Why would you give your customers something worse? It doesn't make sense. You refine it in the R&D fase until it's on par with the thing that it's replacing.

You know which company had the idea about a product? Boeing, when they introduced the 737 Max: ""oh, it gets better with a software update"". How did that go? 

Second, you have a lot of blind faith. Just to bring you back to earth, Tesla can't even get the automatic windshield wipers right. It's always a surprise with the updates. FYI, It's broken now with the latest version on my Model 3 from 2019 AP2.5. And I'm not the only one. That implementation is using vision-only since the start. You would think that such use case is something easy to implement. But it's not.

Machine Learning is trickier than sensor input. It's Blackbox vs White box. As a software engineer I choose White box any day. I'm glad that other car companies do the same thing."

2021-06-30 16:34:50,wallstreetbets,Well done. When did you pick up those 1/22/22 $12 calls? That $3.50 is pretty good so far for Ford options.
2021-06-30 16:39:04,wallstreetbets,"And all of these giants in the industry already have a huge advantage insofar as existing supply lines, manufacturing, distribution, sells. warranties and maintenance.    Tesla is far enough along that they will continue to be a force but I think a lot of these pure EV companies aren't going to last."
2021-06-30 19:44:20,wallstreetbets,"Per a news article from July 2020, Toyota was partnering with Panasonic for limited production of SSB's by 2025. They still need to solve per that article the short life of SSB's... feel like I have heard this story before from many others.

Basically, Tesla has a better chance of mass-producing $50 per kWh 4680's that can be structurally integrated and provide all the range and performance you need in an EV, by 2025 than Toyota has of having access to sufficient quantities of SSB's by 2030 (consider that 4680 is a substantial improvement in how batteries are manufactured, whereas SSB's for the time being if they are not in the 4680 format will be slower and likely more expensive to produce).

SSB's will also be much more expensive as they will be in demand for electric flight and other applications where integrating sufficient number of 4680's into structural components might not be easy.

Basically, while SSB development is important not sure you will see them in any substantial number of cars for a good decade or so."

2021-06-30 15:42:08,wallstreetbets,"The June recall was deadass just a software update üòÇ it was all FUD but a bearish sentiment is that China could use teslas tech in xpeng, nio, etc. But as long as Tesla becomes a name brand in China it should come out on top"

2021-06-30 13:55:47,wallstreetbets,I think NIO wins this. In China only. TESLA wins the world though IMO
2021-06-30 17:11:57,wallstreetbets,"Giga Berlin, Giga Austin, 4680s, better tech than everyone in Legacy Auto by 5 years, FSD on the way with no competitor having anything close to Vision (Lidar is a joke for true Level 5). FSD= Robotaxis. BULLISH TSLA all the way, this is not your legacy auto company this is a tech monopoly in disguise. 5 years from now when you get picked up by a Tesla Robotaxi for a very low price and see advertisements (future revenue stream) going across the interior screens of the car as you chill out and do some work, you will realize wow I should‚Äôve bought some shares in this Goliath of a company when it was still David."

Go back to Twitter Dr. Burry"
2021-06-30 16:55:10,wallstreetbets,"Neoliberals ruined everything and empowered the modern era fascist empire for a few additional shekels by moving production to China.

China WILL eradicate every single competing company one at a time when it suits them. They control their population so fully, that they don't need to create any tariffs or complex trade arrangements to avoid western companies' competition. China will just propaganda the companies they dislike and chinese people will obey.

China WILL also stop respecting the shady ADR arrangements as well, once they feel like they are losing too much money / influence to foreigners."
2021-06-30 13:48:03,wallstreetbets,"No Need to shit talk for Tesla. Find someone who owns a Tesla and ask them if you can tag along to the next Service Center visit for repairing anything. The Service Advisor will do a great job of it by themselves!

I highly recommend going to the Seaside, CA Tesla Service center and have Ken Sickler as your service advisor... this guy will flat out tell you to sell your tesla and never buy another one üòÇü§£üòÅüòÜ"
2021-06-30 16:51:45,wallstreetbets,TSLA's other big problem is failure to deliver FSD.
2021-06-30 15:59:12,wallstreetbets,There is little doubt Tesla is way overvalued. But that is par for the course in 2021. Likely nothing will happen until there is some giant market panic and then we'll see where Tesla ends up landing. I suspect about 25% of where it's at today given their eroding monopoly.
2021-06-30 15:51:37,wallstreetbets,NIO is the play
2021-06-30 14:11:59,wallstreetbets,"And I didn‚Äôt even get into the fact that legacy automakers like Volkswagen and Ford are about to obliterate Tesla‚Äôs market share, or the fact that Musk is a fucking idiot, who tanks his own stock for fun with shitposts.

2021-06-30 16:45:01,wallstreetbets,This is exactly my take after reading this
2021-06-30 15:44:15,wallstreetbets,"100%, Tesla had first to market on their side, but their lack of ability to solidify the self driving tech has made them no different than ford when they mass produce in a year or two, tesla's valuation was damn near everyone in the world owning a tesla and that dream is a bust"
2021-06-30 14:44:38,wallstreetbets,"That, too."
2021-06-30 13:48:53,wallstreetbets,"I would wait. 

That P/E ratio is garbage."
2021-06-30 15:50:06,wallstreetbets,"Good point, but keep in mind that the state media is doing everything in their power to make Tesla look bad. 

And consumers in China are clearly responding to that.

It‚Äôs about public perception of what happened, not what actually happened."
2021-06-30 13:48:17,wallstreetbets,"Sorry about that. 

Here: https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/28/business/tesla-china-recall-intl-hnk/index.html

Fixed in the OP as well."

2021-06-30 16:22:49,wallstreetbets,"LI might be a good short term play, because a lot of people prefer hybrids to pure EVs, due to range anxiety.

All three have their strengths."
2021-06-30 16:19:06,wallstreetbets,"I like XPEV, too. 

In terms of being the ‚ÄúTesla of China,‚Äù I‚Äôd say they fit the bill better, because of their AV tech, and their massive R&D investments."
2021-06-30 14:30:10,wallstreetbets,Do you have a position on this? Puts?
2021-06-30 15:48:31,wallstreetbets,"Read the OP, my guy. No positions in TSLA."
2021-06-30 18:14:42,wallstreetbets,Yea even that f\*ckboy Gordon Johnson comes up with a better bear case than this re-hash of news almost everyone following the space already knew of.
2021-06-30 15:53:21,wallstreetbets,"Shh, the Elon stans will downvote you if you keep talking sense."
2021-06-30 17:50:56,wallstreetbets,But it's not just a car company!?!?
2021-06-30 13:58:29,wallstreetbets,Have you seen the rest of the market lately? :P
2021-06-30 13:51:57,wallstreetbets,Garbage ‚Ä¶ it really is the stock is where it should be in 2 years with a p/e like that‚Ä¶.
2021-06-30 16:34:59,wallstreetbets,China government more influential than Chinese consumers.
2021-06-30 19:07:33,wallstreetbets,"This. Everything with China is a risk.  China could ‚Äúdrive out‚Äù Tesla like they did Goggle and uber, and it was China that did that not the competition, but China‚Äôs EVs face hurdles as well. Tesla has name recognition outside of China.  While Tesla definitely wants to do business in China I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs as make it break as op lays out.  Of course Tesla‚Äôs valuation doesn‚Äôt make much sense without China‚Äôs market."
2021-06-30 16:22:09,wallstreetbets,"I get that, I hear its the TITS for tire rotations üòÇü§£ but when it comes to actually fixing real issues, the service centers don't want to actually change any parts or fix REAL issues."
2021-06-30 18:18:20,wallstreetbets,"I've had a Model 3 for 3 years and picked up a Y last summer. Both early VINs and most kinks have been straightened out in my driveway by the same person. It feels like I have my own personal service technician that's only an app message away.

Never going back to any other car brand."
2021-06-30 13:59:27,wallstreetbets,"They're built like consumer electronics, not like cars."
2021-06-30 14:47:04,wallstreetbets,"I don't but I agree.   The Tesla models now will be competing with Ford, BMW, even Subaru. And people still like the traditional dealer network. Other biggest worry is if we ever stop subsidizing electric."
2021-06-30 14:40:43,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I‚Äôm just investing in Chinese EVs and leaving it at that. 

Not betting against Tesla, because as a few have pointed out here, they might retain a decent chunk of their market share here in the U.S., and do reasonably well. I just doubt it.

The U.S. market is very crowded, and about to get even more so. So I‚Äôm investing in infrastructure and battery plays (BATT and CHPT) when it comes to the U.S. 

I just want everyone to be aware of how Chinese propaganda will affect sales. And, as I said in the OP, the CPC does not really have any scruples about kicking foreign companies out, be it with subsidies (DiDi/Uber) or outright bans (Baidu/Google)."
2021-06-30 15:54:37,wallstreetbets,So you have 1 share of Xpeng and Li and ZERO skin in the game regarding your post? Pathetic
2021-06-30 16:48:38,wallstreetbets,"I mean I didn‚Äôt go into what else they did, I had an engine issue once and it was resolved very quickly"
2021-06-30 16:48:48,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs amusing to me how much that phrase haunts you
2021-06-30 18:28:18,wallstreetbets,Who the hell still likes the traditional dealer network? Thinking of the last time I bought a car from a ford dealership still makes my blood boil.
2021-06-30 16:22:50,wallstreetbets,"So you want to point out how everyone should be aware of how the CCP will try and push Chinese EVs over TSLA, and that this will have a material affect, as will an increasingly crowded US EV market, but not willing to short a share or buy a put??  


Stick to white people twitter and democratic socialism forums if you want to bash a stock without putting any skin in the game or proving your positions in competitors  


Have 100 TSLA at $700 since May, been selling weekly calls at $700 as it's been below that since I bought it

Edit: tell me what your return is vs. S&P if you had gone all in on BIDU following GOOGL getting banned in 2010"
2021-06-30 16:54:35,wallstreetbets,"I understand, you over sold your Atlanta Tesla Service station as being the TITS when in reality they never did any work that required physically replacing any parts. Everything was done with software (same as I can do on all my cars since the early 90's with a laptop). I consider all software diag issues and software update issues as a trivial task, wrenching on a car where you need to take apart the entire dash to get at a stupid sunroof gear because someone engineered a simple issue in a complicated place as being a bonehead product design.

But hey, let me know how it goes when you need REAL service on your car and the TITS service center tells you to go take a flying leap like my friend Ken Sickler @ the Seaside, CA Tesla Service Center. I consider them the ASS not so much the TITS.

BTW there is no ""engine"" in a Tesla..."
2021-06-30 16:56:37,wallstreetbets,"Never imagined anyone would use that combination of words to describe joy in something ""Its the TITS""! üòÇü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÜüòùüòäüòÅ

2021-06-30 18:26:08,wallstreetbets,"I have two early VIN teslas:

\-Headlight replacement

\-Windshield replacement

\-Power Conversion System replacement

\-Frunk latch mechanism replacement

\-Charge Port charge plate replacement

Is that enough ""real car work"" for you? Repair service was stellar every time with a lot of it performed in my driveway, which is great when you have young kids, no childcare during a pandemic and you and your spouse both work off-shift full-time.

The only REAL negative was when I couldn't get down to my closest service center to get a Tesla loaner for the PCS replacement and had to deal with a shitty, brand new BMW 5-series for a week..."

2021-06-30 17:00:40,wallstreetbets,"I don't buy puts for any stock, ever... because stocks can only go to zero... but they can rise to Infiniti. I'm more of an AAPL kinda guy anyways."
2021-06-30 19:13:31,wallstreetbets,"Early VIN Model S? Was that in the hay day where they had only a hand full of customers?

This should be noted as a major risk for any of these companies, as some will fall from favor fast. And if there‚Äôs anything in the world that will drop a company‚Äôs pipeline fast, it‚Äôs medicine.

If we buy new shares (which we are not) the company gets money. In this case, the shareholder before you (me) got money.

However, this DD sounds great, but in reality this tech is old news.  Practically all molecular bio labs can do 99.99999% of these methods.

The elements missing are the genomic sequences that are not identified/confirmed/trademarked.  

Even identified there are theories like polycistronic (one sequence yield multiple genotypcial traits) or monocistronic (one sequence one trait).   Before you politically correct lab rats start to try to correct me, yes I know, genotype phenotype and mRNA blah blah blah‚Ä¶. This is a very watered down Reddit explanation on the subject matter and not to be treated like a phd thesis defense.

So.

Absolutely not.  I hate to say it but Cathy is way over her head on gene editing and overestimating the current genomic revolution.

Our current understanding of a simple bacterium is like less than 1/100 of 1%.  If we master genomic tech and manipulation, then the clinical trial will literally take 1-2 treatment cycle if that."

Then you either sell them for a loss or hold them and watch them expire worthless every fucking time. The only way I've been able to see slowly build my account back is learning to identify key levels (support and resistance) and price targets. Unfortunately this doesn't work well for meme stocks. I learned the hard way but WSB plays inevitably end up with you blowing up your entire account."

2021-06-30 17:47:30,wallstreetbets,Why do you say that? Do some actual research next time. It‚Äôs actually undervalued by every financial site compared to GME lol

Move the top one to the high of the top left wick, and connect it to the highest middle red wick.

Connect the low of the left most candle to the 40.00 low a few candles to the right of it.

Otherwise - you are right - AMC is coiling up for a huge move. I don't think it's decidedly up yet though."

2021-06-30 17:54:52,wallstreetbets,"If you're a serious investor I suggest you look into AMC yourself.

I see a lot of comment trashing AMC with some very vague and uninformed arguments, and it would be stupid to listen to people who don't know what they are talking about.

I have a lot of AMC (some GME too), I'm not telling to buy or not to buy, but I am definitely advising you to look into it since at this point it's either: you are going to make some incredible gains on it or you'll loose most of your investment - and since January of this year I've done none stop DD's that led me to my personal conclusion."
2021-06-30 17:20:54,wallstreetbets,I keep selling short strangles on it
2021-06-30 16:10:34,wallstreetbets,"Some people day trade it, some people are selling to apes that aren't already fully invested in bags. There are no new buyers, people still playing options are mostly losing due to high premiums. If the stock goes up then bagholders will flee, there is no chance of a squeeze as the short interest is low, liquidity is high, and shorts closed early positions a month ago meaning current shorts are holding averages over $50. Market cap keeps retail investors unable to move the price up. If the stock falls there is no outside interest in buying until it hits single digits besides those who may try to profit off of a bounce. So there is a strong ceiling in the 60s and the floor is under $10 as the actual company wasn't trading at the equivalent of $10 even back when it was profitable five years ago. Streaming services and movie production companies are killing their business. Theaters, like airlines and restaurants, only profit when capacity is very high, and it's not, AMC will likely close some of it's theaters at a loss to move customers to fewer locations to reduce expenses."
2021-06-30 16:43:03,wallstreetbets,"It's manipulated to remain rangebound, so MMs such as Citadel can collect the massive premiums. This will probably continue until the IV decreases enough where keeping it in the range would no longer be worth it. At that point one thing that could happen would be a sudden move to pump the IV again."
2021-06-30 13:05:47,wallstreetbets,Kenny boy would agree.
2021-06-30 17:23:39,wallstreetbets,"a wise old timer once told me:

  
*""you can be right, or you can make money""*"
2021-06-30 13:10:26,wallstreetbets,"Why would the falling volume be a bad thing? That's exactly why I like it. After such a big move, it needs time to rest. You only enter this once Price action confirms the breakout, not before."
2021-06-30 15:22:14,wallstreetbets,"They are called candlesticks, its a more transparent version of just using a line to display the stock price chart."
2021-06-30 18:59:09,wallstreetbets,Jesus what a retarded play. Like mouth-breathing actual retard.
2021-06-30 18:57:43,wallstreetbets,"Short interest is the highest it‚Äôs been since January, at 19.something% and has continued to climb. No shorts covered in the push to 72$, s3 filing just took dilution off the table, and the next share holder vote I can say with 99.99% confidence that dilution will not be issued."
2021-06-30 15:58:30,wallstreetbets,Fair enough :)
2021-06-30 17:44:53,wallstreetbets,"So we're done here? It's more of a bottle rocket?

2021-06-30 12:49:51,wallstreetbets, Ayeee!!! Congrats on being so wrong and happy about it! Not attached to reality? I guess you haven‚Äôt read much of what‚Äôs going on. They say ignorance is bliss üòÑ
2021-06-30 12:49:53,wallstreetbets,I feel like TA on momentum stocks is almost more valid bc there's far more traders that are also looking for the same signals trading the stock .. idk tho I just watch ppl trade those stocks I dont have the nutsack to try and daytrade any of these otherworldly momentum plays.
2021-06-30 12:47:38,wallstreetbets,"Let's just agree to disagree. TA is a tool to understand how stocks move - not magic.

2021-06-30 13:01:57,wallstreetbets,"These guys bought over $60, they can't publicly acknowledge the high potential for the stock to collapse at any moment as they are still trying to unload their bags on to others at breakeven prices."

2021-06-30 13:04:47,wallstreetbets,"CLOV does look good too, might be ready to move as well - surfing both the 20- and 10day. If AMC pops, likely CLOV will too."
2021-06-30 13:58:38,wallstreetbets,"Look at previous breakouts. Volume is only high once it's starts moving, naturally. You have to be ready and enter once it does"
2021-06-30 18:13:07,wallstreetbets,The date of the squeeze/to the moon is always today's date+1.

2021-06-30 13:42:49,wallstreetbets,"And of course having approval from Kenny, who made billions playing the market, is a good thing. Or are you more interested in getting support from wage-workers who have no experience in the market?"
2021-06-30 13:47:29,wallstreetbets,"Falling volume means interest in buying has dried up, a few people are buying with limit orders as the price falls, but she's going to sink and the low volume means she's going to sink fast unless there are a whole lot of limit buy orders which doesn't make sense for a stock who's only value was the potential for a squeeze which would never occur if the price fell substantially."
2021-06-30 18:15:46,wallstreetbets,"nope, he dosent know what he's talking about"
2021-06-30 14:11:03,wallstreetbets,"This. Only bag holders pump so hard.
Everyone keeps talking about how much they have made, but then they say they aren't selling.
You have to sell to profit."
2021-06-30 13:18:38,wallstreetbets,I dont hate you. I just think Clov will make me more. Good luck to anyone who is fighting the HF
2021-06-30 13:05:37,wallstreetbets,I like both. I personally think Clov has a higher upside percent is all. The Short interest currently is ridiculous.
2021-06-30 14:01:22,wallstreetbets,Bull flags and pennants usually resolve within 2-4 weeks time. How long we been in this pennant? Since the beginning of June? I see this as something the HF‚Äôs are seriously manipulating and could quite possibly keep this going somehow indefinitely. Tired of having all my eggs in one basket. Not making any money that way. I could have made a couple grand+ over that time.
2021-06-30 15:49:46,wallstreetbets,I hate dates cuz I can never get one.
2021-06-30 18:40:15,wallstreetbets,"Given the upvotes that comment is getting, there's a few other people who don't get it."
2021-06-30 18:31:14,wallstreetbets,"Oh dang ya you're right, forgot about may cutoff date thing"
2021-06-30 18:14:14,wallstreetbets,Isn't that what the Internet is for?
2021-06-30 18:20:49,wallstreetbets,"I don't agree that sharing good investing practices is saying nothing.

It seemed to me as essential to underline the fact that asking the comments of a post a summary of 7 months of active stock market movements is a risky idea - especially when the answers are thrashing a stock that went from 4$ to strong consolidations all the way up to 57$.

I want to make sure that I give a unbias and useful response, which is : look into AMC yourself because you might regret getting influenced by random people in the comment section. (Since these cases, AMC and GME, are very unique cases)

Anyways, gl to all investors regardless of the stocks you choose to bet on."
2021-06-30 15:11:17,wallstreetbets,"This is r/wallstreetbets. If you're not in this to fuck over everyone else and make copious amounts of cash, you don't belong here, and you're an autist, not a retard"

2021-06-30 13:53:56,wallstreetbets,"Look at previois breakouts. Volume is only high once it actually breaks out. The volume before that is irrelevant. What I'm saying is to wait for volume, then enter."

2021-06-30 13:58:11,wallstreetbets,Yeah I've made a nice chunk since $77. Been flipping the calls. A lot people just loaded up on calls in the last hour. How I know? Stock price has stayed the same yet all call options just jumped 10%. Implied volatility is our friend üòé

I'm telling myself that this dip is a low volume profit taking moment and that tomorrow will shine. I've already seen two upgrades on the stock today and revised price targets $20 higher than previously stated.
2021-06-30 14:19:46,wallstreetbets,I mean what expiry on those 82c
2021-06-30 16:45:16,wallstreetbets,"I think it's whales taking profit which drove the price down since retail investors can't trade as much in after hours.    

Really annoying that Micron excels in their earnings reports just to see the stock price drop shortly after"

2021-06-30 15:13:56,wallstreetbets,good luck then. basically an ER play at this point that will either get you more $ or they'll expire worthless.

its ITM but IV is still a thing

gl"
2021-06-30 15:42:01,wallstreetbets,I trimmed a bit but I know earnings will skyrocket the price. I'm hoping I'll be better off trying to sell immediately at open than take smaller profits bow.

2021-06-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I believe in AMD So I‚Äôve been following AMD since it was a $30 little boy share, and I‚Äôve always believed in it long. Looking at its history, you can see the annual returns over the last five years have been great. But here‚Äôs why this particular autist really likes this stock. But first, a bit of backstory about AMD.

###Who is AMD and why do we care?

**Advanced Micro Devices** (AMD) is a computer hardware development and manufacturing company at its core. They design and sell Processors, GPUs, APUs, and the like. For anyone who has been into gaming or building PCs, you‚Äôd probably recognize AMD as the ‚Äúbudget build‚Äù: the company who‚Äôs processors you buy when you don‚Äôt want to shell out $900 for a top shelf Intel. They have always been seen as an underdog in Intel‚Äôs shadow, with Intel having the superior clock speeds, Hyperthreading tech, and better clout when it comes to contracting.

###Next Gen Consoles

Currently the latest gaming consoles are the PS5 and the Xbox Series X, both being relatively impossible to get your hands on due to the microchip shortage (more on that later). *AMD powers both.*

Let that sink in. AMD has no competition for this generation of video game consoles. Every PS5 and Xbox X that gets built, AMD gets a chunk of that change. This is basically guaranteed profit for the life of the console, historically that‚Äôs about 6-7 more years.

###Server Hardware

AMD has been expanding their server hardware lineup, and their biggest competitor Intel has dropped the ball on this one: their new server hardware isn‚Äôt rolling out til Q1 2022. Meanwhile, Google is replacing outdated hardware with AMD processors. This is a big step for AMD, because it puts them in the position of no longer being the underdog, and gives them juicy, profitable market share.

###CEO Lisa Su

Lisa Su is an awesome woman. She has a diverse background including Texas Instruments and IBM, and since she took the reigns of AMD in 2014, the stock has soared. She helped diversify their product line success, and saw the immense benefit of getting AMD server chips licensed in China.

###The future of work

Lots of people see the future of work moving towards a larger working from home model (anecdotal). Working from home requires hardware, and people buying hardware prefer to spend less if they can, and this is the hardware AMD specializes in.

###Semiconductor Shortage

The massive demand for semiconductors for everything from cars to laptops to servers has been a drag on literally the entire economy. Auto manufactory lines in Midwest America are at a standstill while car lots are barren of new vehicles because of the world‚Äôs ‚Äújust in time‚Äù production model collapsing under increased demand.

I personally believe this shortage is artificially holding down the price of AMD, as big money is slower to invest in a company that could potentially suffer from the shortage. Once things pick back up, there is a lot of potential for accelerated movement upwards as things become available to the public for purchase.

AMD is a preferred client of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), which has invested billions into additional manufacturing capacity.

###Get on the train before it leaves!

Once these processors start shipping out, the profits will roll in and sentiment will return. Boarding this rocket begins now! ü¶ç üöÄ üåù 

I hold 100 shares @84 average and some 12/17/21 $155 calls.

Also, I‚Äôm profoundly autistic, my late wife‚Äôs second boyfriend told me so. This is not financial advice, I am retarded."

2021-06-30 11:38:38,wallstreetbets,I believe in AMD to the tune of 2$ increases every week doubling my investment over and over.
2021-06-30 12:34:01,wallstreetbets,"AMD is in the logic gate design industry, NOT manufacturing. 

Intel kept their foundries which is why Intel has worse PE ratios compared to AMD and NVDA. Manufacturing is very capital intensive and low margin (generally). Obviously when they are all running at capacity, margins are great. Capacity is industry secret so nobody will ever know what capacity is and whether anyone is lying. There is basically no reason for foundries to advertise free capacity unless they are stupid. 

TSMC are killing it now though and gaining know how with EUV which is very valuable. Its also a strategically important industry which the Taiwan government will protect at all costs. Probably another reason why the US would go to war if PRC tries to invade. They want to keep China out of this bleeding edge technology. TSMC seem to be pumping chunks into Capex for plants in the US. God knows why they pick Arizona when they need water but hey ho. That said, I think there are better investments than TSMC. More on that later. 

AMD's main advantage is in CPU over Intel in x86. To this day, I cant allocate how much this is due to AMD being better in R&D than Intel vs Intel giving up on EUV with ASML. Either way, Intel screwed up huge and looks to be about 2 years behind in tech. I read somewhere that Intel has got ASML lined up to provide some hardware for Intel in 2023. They may or may not regain competitive products around there since my gut is they prefer monolithic vs chiplet design and they need pellicles for that (yield reasons) and EUV/Pellicles seems to work now. Nothing to concern me for near future but long term, we will need to see what AMD has lined up for 2023 vs new monolithic dies from Intel. Their latest product stack (Emerald Rapids) slipping into 2023 is great for AMD. Still stuck on 10nm. KEK

What the fuck is ASML? They produce the EUV machines for foundries. They have a monopoly on this. All foundries that want to use EUV must buy from ASML. ASML is printing money and cant invest it fast enough so gives dividends. ASML price has gone bananas but its probably still a decent buy imo. Their margins are huge because... they can be. Who else are foundries going to get EUV tech from? Exact entry price? I am going to wait for a small dip and then buy into it. I am late to the party for sure. Applied Materials also a supplier for foundries. No monopoloy like ASML but still very important supplier. 

So why dont I like TSMC as much as ASML and Applied Materials? In the end, they are still a manufacturer. At the mercy of supply demand. Its cyclical. Decent investment but I prefer to invest into monopolies. 

NVDA? Priced too high for my liking but prob just still goes up like TSLA for unexplained reasons. They are KILLING it in GPU and datacentre. AMD exists in this space but NVDA just has the superior tech and mature software stack with CUDA. 

So anyway, whats the TL:DR?

Semi conductor market can only go up imo. Up chunks. Like more than analysts estimate. 

You can capture this better through AMD and ASML than vs Intel (bad tech for now), NVDA (over priced for me but might still just go up). 

I am long AMD. Looking to hold for 10ish years. Maybe this bitch hits 400 a share or something once AMD holds 60% of datacentre CPU. 

Dont play weeklies and stuff. Just buy the stock or if you must do options, do LEAPS. 

""its all priced in"" - is it fuck. Still lots of gains to be had, just cant prediuct weekly prices. 

Not financial advice bla bla bla"

2021-06-30 12:18:08,wallstreetbets,"I can also tell you right now that the most recent release of Ryzen CPUs have blown Intel out of the water.

Intel will never have to bail out AMD again to avoid a monopoly. It might even be the other way around some day."
2021-06-30 14:55:39,wallstreetbets,"i am an AMD fanboy since i started building PCs in the late 90s, and i hold AMD stock for a while now

but remember history... 

AMD was at the top of the CPU world in the early to mid 00s with the K8 CPUs (first 64bit and dual core). they were completely kicking intel's ass in the desktop and server markets. then intel simply pulled some anti competitive shit to undercut AMD with secret deals and rebates with computer manufacturers. AMD won the lawsuits, but the damage was already done.... AMD share price didn't start to recover until the release of ryzen, and then really took off when it achieved meme stonk status.

I think call options are a little bit dicey at this point as I'd expect it to flatten out for a while after this crazy 1-2 week run. Your $155 number is definitely... ambitious.

2021-06-30 14:43:21,wallstreetbets,">uge and looks to be about 2 years behind in tech. I read somewhere that Intel has got ASML lined up to provide some hardware for Intel in 2023. They may or may not regain competitive products around there since my gut is they prefer monolithic vs chiplet design and they need pellicles for that (yield reasons) and EUV/Pellicles seems to work now. Nothing to concern me for near future but long term, we will need to see what AMD has lined up for 2023 v

lisa su has been pheonemal.  Her biggest contribution was setting up the execution engine with their overlapping products teams - even as zen 4 is in design, zen 5 and zen 6 are also in development.   Not to mention the stellar management team with Mark Papermaster and Forrest Norrod and David Wang.   Long term strategy is being consistently reached with Su"

2021-06-30 16:55:28,wallstreetbets,My question is. Will this company change at all? Doubt it.
2021-06-30 16:59:05,wallstreetbets,My question is how will Robinhood change? Should it be forced to close its doors for misleading its consumers? I guess not. Will just let them keep on doing it i guess.

2021-06-30 13:02:35,wallstreetbets,That's an important question. It's a really good question. I appreciate the fine. As a young boy in Bulgaria I would manipulate the market all the time.
2021-06-30 13:14:29,wallstreetbets,This is like $700 dollars to them. Chump change but I guess FINRA is just getting their cut of the pie

2021-06-30 11:27:01,wallstreetbets,They should have to pay out non-robinhood holders of the stocks who were effected too.  This fine is peanuts compared to what it should be.

punish those who had nothing to do with meme stocks and options?"
2021-06-30 11:02:13,wallstreetbets,Slap on the wrist. They were fined $65m but they probably profited over $100+ million using all of those tactics
2021-06-30 11:02:53,wallstreetbets,Slap on the fingertips
2021-06-30 17:00:20,wallstreetbets,But what dose that really do? Dose it just make the rich men a little less rich? Or is it going to force Robinhood to make changes? If its not shutting down for practical fraud. Then what's the point of all this?
2021-06-30 12:21:07,wallstreetbets,13 million to compensate users for losses and there is 13 million users... Can't wait to buy more calls with my $1 settlement money.

2021-06-30 14:57:46,wallstreetbets,not sure selling order flow from retail is something good they did
2021-06-30 15:14:15,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve only skimmed the AWC (on finra‚Äôs website), so someone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.  but the example in this article (zero cost trades) isn‚Äôt something that is mentioned by FINRA at all.  It‚Äôs 123 pages describing false and misleading statements to customers, failure to report customer complaints, some supervisory issues, and basically approving options accounts when they shouldn‚Äôt have.

So maybe the ‚Äúgood thing‚Äù the article is referring to is making options trading more accessible to individuals. I don‚Äôt know.  But finra‚Äôs allegations are that they were approving options trading for ‚Äúlow risk clients‚Äù and not appropriately disclosing the risks.  Which is a a bit simplified, but you can read the allegations - I think they‚Äôre fair."

2021-06-30 15:59:31,wallstreetbets,Keeping money in Robinhood is hurting the cause. Move your cash to a real brokerage.
2021-06-30 11:38:50,wallstreetbets,Also the next tactic will tray and net them more profit to help cover this fine from the last one
2021-06-30 17:03:33,wallstreetbets,I am sure they will make changes but not sure if its going to benefit us though.
2021-06-30 13:20:49,wallstreetbets,"Restitution is not paid pro rata but is for specific conduct tied to specific events.  As part of the investigation, FINRA will usually identify situations where, for example, a customer has been overcharged or should have been given a better price, and then FINRA requires the firm to find all such instances.  After doing so, they total them up, and that's the restitution."
2021-06-30 12:57:38,wallstreetbets,Don't care about any of that. Back in March i had both spy calls and puts.. I was up 2k by noon...  couldn't sell. Couldn't do anything. Just watch my account. They sold my options after 4:30 at 9:30 am prices. I lost everything. New and confused. Filled multiple sec reports for every outage. It happened multiple times

I dropped them immediately after the GameStop fall out."

2021-06-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Transitory or Persistent Inflation? Why can't it be both? Media coverage has been reckoning the debate between the transitory or not nature of inflation (because inflation is definitely here).

It has been quite frequent, Fund managers and economists arguing whether the inflation is overshooting the target of 3.5% or will reach (possibly late 2021-early 2022) to an inflection point where CPI and PPI readings will start shifting downwards.

Inflation is currently based on the argument of the pent up demand and the vast and rooting supply chain disruptions due to Covid-19 pandemic especially after some certain incidents throughout the year (Colonial Pipeline Hack, Suez Canal Blockage, Brazilian Meat Production Unit Ransomware attack).

But what if the truth lies somewhere in the middle? Can it be that prices for certain goods and services will persist at the higher levels (and maybe more) than the Fed's expectations, but there will be an inflection point, where inflationary pressures, in general will start shifting down, after certain supply chain issues (logistics and freights) are starting to loose , in context with consumer demand for spending (after summer curb)?

And if that's the case, how can portfolios be diversified, in order to provide coverage, protection and alpha in this highly uncertain environment?IMO, inflation will start shifting down, but certain industries or even companies will benefit from the increased prices, even after the input costs start diminishing. In plain language, some industries will keep higher prices for their products in the future benefitting from the higher prices NOW!

Those industries can be **oligopolistic tech, healthcare, pharmaceuticals and real estate.**

All of those industries mentioned have one thing in common, **pricing power**, which translates to an undeniable moat and affects the elasticity of the products they are offered. **Inelastic demand** for the product , means greater negotiating power with the consumer, thus an excess premium to acquire the product, resulting to increased revenue, even after Cost of Goods Sold starts shifting down (input costs, inflation downwards pressure).

What is your take on inflation and what are the sectors you are looking for this generational trade?"

2021-06-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Big Brain Canoo Puzzle-Solving Could $GOEV this Shorted-Rocket FUEL Alright everybody, strap on your thinking caps and PAY ATTENTION.

Earlier this year, Canoo tweeted **this**

https://preview.redd.it/eigtugc10f871.png?width=1246&format=png&auto=webp&s=f92bb0e99f452ffadd1a9f31e55dd1b7431cd077

This string of emojis is a puzzle of what to expect this year. Canoo confirmed on twitter that their factory announcement/factory renderings is the first one with the crane.

https://preview.redd.it/7aaxb9b30f871.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc9029953f1eb69180a7faa498e470195c84db99

**So what could be next?** The battery could be an announcement of where/who they are getting their batteries from \*cough üçé\*cough, but I am more focused on the **handshake.** Because what does a handshake mean? : **A deal**. And what is a type of a deal? : **Partnerships.**

It has long been speculated that a deal with one of the big Rideshare companies like Uber or Lyft is very in play here. But even if it's not them, there must be a deal with **ONE or MULTIPLE** companies coming. **They just committed to building a 1 MILLION square foot factory on a 400 acre site.** You think management would make that big of a commitment if they weren't for certain there is adequate demand?

**You think the state of Oklahoma signed a contract with Canoo to give them $300M+ in incentives without seeing proof there was going to be adequate demand?!?!**

Say all you want about the minivan's design, but somebody wants it, and a lot of it.

https://preview.redd.it/sm0qfuo40f871.png?width=1218&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1eca3b4d8888f0907d8dbde29a9e1a64db459d2

The short interest on Canoo is now just about **40%** with practically 0 left to borrow. This thing is going to explode when there is confirmation of any sort of deal. 

**TLDR: There is big demand for Canoo's vehicles in the form of a deal coming, and with 40% SI and a low float the stock will üöÄwhen confirmed.**

1) was priced at the higher end of its its range at $26 and opened at like 44 that day. And hasn‚Äôt seen that value since
2) it‚Äôs like LinkedIn for doctors with lots of incredible value to enable their productivity (customized medical news, collaboration tools, booking patient costs etc). 80% of us doctors are on it. WOW! It‚Äôs here to stay!

3) almost 80% of its revenues is from ads. Pharma companies will pay tons of money to get a chance to get the attention of these doctors. Most of the pharma companies have sales reps called medical science liaisons who travel geography to do this. $DOCS can help them do that virtually. It‚Äôs like Facebook for pharma companies.

4) major health care providers can use it as a recruitment tool. It‚Äôs like ziprecruiter in that sense

5) it‚Äôs already profitable and can fund it‚Äôs own operations. That is pretty amazing!

6) it sold 23 million shares in its IPO.Out of that a whole bunch are already lapped by institutional investors

7) pharma is a recession proof industry and this company is a great hedge against any form of volatility.

I am long on it and I think the story is too good and too strong .

The only headwind is when analysts jump in and give their views on pricing."

2021-06-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Where the real money is at: Sugar futures For those of you who've been living under a rock, futures are contracts to buy something at a price you paid sometime in the future. If you don't know what sugar is, well then then that explains why you're here, but I'm not going to explain it. Basically, people are getting obese quickly. And to fuel their habits, they need sugar. With all this body positivity going on, sales will only increase over the next few years. ""How can I take advantage of this?"" you may ask, and to you, I say Sugar futures, specifically Sugar #11 futures. Essentially, if you buy 1 of these contracts, you hold about 112k lbs of sugar. 2024 contracts are trading at a huge discount, about 21% below prices of current contracts.

Bull case:

People keep getting fatter, and sugar prices skyrocket due to demand. You've now made $5k minimum on a $20k max risk. Now this isn't Wallstreet play-it-safe, and since you don't have to foot that full payment, and margin requirement is $1k, you can buy 15 contracts with $25k and you'll probably be safe (unless futures drop about 5%, but we'll worry about margin calls when the time comes). With 15 contracts, you'll make $75k minimum in 3 years time, and of course you can sell early to bag some of that cash

Neutral Case:

Fat people stay as they are but nobody else wants to be fat, and your sugar futures sell for the price you bought them at

Bear Case:

A mass extinction of obese people occurs, and suddenly everyone cares about healthiness. You get margin called, but lucky you, you only lose $10k because the clearing house said fuck you and closed your position. Alternatively, if you manage to stay above margin call territory, you're left holding a 110k lbs bag of sugar, which you can then use to make lemonade, and some nice cakes for the rest of your life. You can hedge against this risk with some Orange Juice futures, which will obviously go up when people decide to move away from sugar

This is a low-risk money-maker right here, and honestly, I'm doing you retards a huge favour with this DD right here. (This is a shitpost for all you dumb enough to call this shit DD)"

2021-06-30 10:31:51,wallstreetbets,"Counter-Bear Case: ‚Äúbetter health‚Äù trends continue, and prices drop as sugar-free and reduced-sugar offerings become more popular, and your options expire worthless - because where the fuck are you going to store 100,000 pounds of sugar, in your wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs shed?"
2021-06-30 11:04:33,wallstreetbets,Betting on fat people getting fatter... I like your thesis. I agree with your thesis. I am not retarded enough to go buy sugar futures.
2021-06-30 10:34:27,wallstreetbets,Financial advice on people getting fatter. I love it. ü§£
2021-06-30 10:56:13,wallstreetbets,Sugar prices haven‚Äôt changed in the grand scheme of things in 30 years.
2021-06-30 11:14:22,wallstreetbets,"First you get the sugar.
Then you get the power.
Then you get the women."
2021-06-30 10:34:17,wallstreetbets,What will you do when all the sugar consumers die of cancer and health problems. What a shitty place to be in the future if your sugar stocks are What goes up.
2021-06-30 12:28:48,wallstreetbets,Regardless share the gains/losses - your flair will be Sugar Daddy or sweet tendies if they are gains‚Ä¶
2021-06-30 12:01:26,wallstreetbets,"I was just looking at MDLZ for the dividends.  They own Oreo and a bunch of other carbs.  Based on what I learned from Wall-E, it seems people are just gonna keep getting fatter.  So I think anything sugar related is probably a safe bet."
2021-06-30 14:23:57,wallstreetbets,"I'd actually offer a a different future, plastics. Rumor is there is a plastic shortage. Pepsi vendors are actually starting to have issues getting bottled water in, and it's only going to get worse from there."
2021-06-30 17:14:16,wallstreetbets,"A lot of sugar (or rather starch which can basically be seen as a lot of stick together sugar) isn't even for consumption but for industrial use. Think of: glue, paper, feedstock for fermentation. Glucose is also the base material to produce HMF which can be used to make PEF (a biopolymer alternative to PET but less degradable). Sugar is also converted into bioethanol and all. 

So I think you might be right, the demand will be ever growing as sugar is a great starting material for green alternative processes. And ofc food. Meanwhile, the amount of land does not really increase. The amount of useful land to farm even shrinks. 

TLDR: sugar goes to mars wayy before the first man will"
2021-06-30 10:37:12,wallstreetbets,"Well honestly I planned on storing it in the back seat of my car. 15 contracts adds up to about 1.55 million lbs of sugar. Haven't done the measurements yet, but look, I doubt it's too much to handle. Worst case scenario, I leave it sitting in the back garden. My wife's boyfriend has been coming around a lot lately, and I think a project like this could really get me on his good side! The bear theses are impossible, fat people keep on getting fatter, and as well as that, people need sugar for tea/coffee. With people being overworked, they need more Coffee, and with more coffee comes more sugar. This can't go tits up."
2021-06-30 15:48:00,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately for most people the better heath trend includes high sugar lifestyles like Vegans (many use sugar to meet caloric requirements) and even the healthiest use sugar based supplements. Gatorade isn't going anywhere and when I hike my local trails where lots of cyclists go I find those empty goop packs of sugar they use to get a boost.

Long sugar"
2021-06-30 10:39:57,wallstreetbets,"Spot-on comment regarding storage. You do not want to find yourself in a position where you are forced to deal with physical delivery.

Also, they don‚Äôt need sugar. HFCS is sweeter and cheaper."
2021-06-30 11:22:50,wallstreetbets,"Third bear: government gets wise to spiraling health costs associated with obesity. Starts taxing TF out of sugar and hfcs. Companies pivot to artificial and low calorie options. 

Your sugar becomes worthless as ice in Antarctica."
2021-06-30 11:16:48,wallstreetbets,So this is how my wife's boyfriend does it! I guess I really had it all wrong.

2021-06-30 10:40:13,wallstreetbets,"There will always be a plentiful supply of fat people looking to get their next high to keep their blood sugar up. This ain't a sugar stock game, this is a sugar game. Sugar futures will make bank (or not, but then I'll have some nice loss porn/sugar to share)"
2021-06-30 10:48:45,wallstreetbets,"I saw this once on the Simpsons, I'm gonna re-watch that episode for some DD. Brb."
2021-06-30 10:55:30,wallstreetbets,"*HFCS is sweeter and cheaper.*

Although the theory of this DD is solid... fatties gonna fat... HFCS is the real monster here, not typical sugar.

I buy the idea of there being some money in sugar futures, but not nearly as much as the OP wants."
2021-06-30 11:18:26,wallstreetbets,"Unless your wife's boyfriend is part of Technotronic, I'd say 99.9% likely"
2021-06-30 12:29:17,wallstreetbets,Well guess what's in that creamy middle?  Sugar.
2021-06-30 10:47:28,wallstreetbets,Just cause liberal America says fat people are healthy doesn't make it true. You need consumers to be alive if you want to make sugar go up. To promote something like this is actually sad. But money money money.
2021-06-30 11:01:17,wallstreetbets,"No, no, no. Liberal America know what they're talking about. I'm fully in support of body positivity, and recommend that people support the movement by putting on a few pounds. Eat them extra biscuits, put that sugar in your drink! You deserve it! (And you're making everyone else bank in the process)"
2021-06-30 10:49:55,wallstreetbets,you get all your facts on liberal America from fox news?

AMD ticker is going on a ride to $120 and $240 in dec 2021 Q1 2022

Intel is in shambles and Pat G will rest and vest while he hires and fires another two or three waves of underling‚Ä¶errr..executives.

NVDA is healthy and Jensen continues to out market everyone in technology. AI mindshare is 100% NVDA. It will take a little time for the green machine to grow into its current valuation and P/E ratio of 100. NVDA will be the first semi company to $1T valuation in late 2022 early 2023."

2021-06-30 10:38:07,wallstreetbets,Intel is heavily invested in research & development.  As someone who knows people who work for Intel they all say it has never been busier. I‚Äôd avoid Intel at all costs but they are a massive company and could turn the ship around
2021-06-30 12:19:27,wallstreetbets,"Be careful shorting Intel,  
They did many errors - Like going for CPU only,  
But they have the cash and personal to turn the ship around, they just need a visionary, and not a business man at the top.  
So I won't invest in Intel, yet I keep them under the radar to the right time.

  
I love NVDA - they are doing great GPU!"

2021-06-30 15:29:06,wallstreetbets,"Recent events should make you reconsider Intel. They are deep-diving into a partnership with SiFive, the world's leading RISC-V company. Many of the SiFive people are ex-Intel, and Intel have signalled a desire to acquire SiFive.

If:

1. Intel-SiFive partnership succeeds, and
2. RISC-V goes big.

Then Intel is strong purchase for long-term hold."

Amd is gaining massive ground in the server space. Server stuff moved slow. Amd finally beating into is massive. They are also in Xbox and ps consoles for cpu and GPU.

Nvidia has the best gpus on the market and are market leaders and command prices to match. Nvidia still can unleash their special move of dropping prices if amd ever catches up. The problem with Nvidia to me is they are already too expensive. Imo over valued. But, I still think they will go up.

Intel has fallen far from their perch atop the cpu market but they dwarf AMD in terms of size and budget. I wouldn't touch Intel options though. Intel is years away from coming back imo. I would consider shares but shares only exist on wsb if it's to fuck shorts. Wait a year or 2 then buy leaps in Intel.

That's my opinion. I gave a couple amd shares as disclosure that expire in August. But don't take what I say as financial advice because I'm dumber than a rock at the best of times"

If they're allowed to get ARM, that stock is going to go from 0-100 real quick.

2021-06-30 12:10:42,wallstreetbets,"Intel must return from ashes to restore its glory. And so it needs to burn badly first. Maybe it will gain some momentum with the incentives but that's it. It invested a lot on economic chips and got beaten by arm, invested a lot on graphics and its graphics division sucks, it's large processors now lags from amd, it's memory division with 3dpoint failed and got sold, it's modem chips got sold and there is nothing, apart from a large monopoly/relationship with servers that makes it make money. And it's going away day after day. Maybe will become the old amd, with very cheap chips, but that is not the actual Intel position. It will go down BADLY"

2021-06-30 12:38:55,wallstreetbets,Intel has had a CEO problem for the last decade.  They took a page from AMD & Nvidia and hired a CEO that has an engineering background.  We will see if it pays off
2021-06-30 16:04:17,wallstreetbets,"I said **long-term** for a reason here. Yes, RISC-V is early days, but it has a clear advantage over ARM by being open-source hardware standard, not subject to licensing and fees associated with licensing.

On the other hand, the fate of the ARM standard is tied to the fate of Arm Ltd - the prospect of an American company (Nvidia) acquiring Arm has made the industry nervous.

We'll see how it plays out, but RISC-V is being used, and increasingly popular.

I refer you to this ArsTechnica article 'SiFive‚Äôs brand-new P550 is one of the world‚Äôs fastest RISC-V CPUs', 6/22/2021:

>For the moment, RISC-V is not a serious competitor to either Arm or x86 in the general-purpose processor space, but it's heavily used in the microcontroller space, due in part to its extensibility and inexpensive licensing. We do broadly expect RISC-V to become a third major player when it comes to general-purpose CPUs‚Äîthe sort that provide the ""main brain"" for phones, tablets, and traditional computers‚Äîbut that is still some years away.

[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/sifives-brand-new-p550-is-one-of-the-worlds-fastest-risc-v-cpus/](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/sifives-brand-new-p550-is-one-of-the-worlds-fastest-risc-v-cpus/)

One of the comments in that article also points out:

>according to Geng Bo, ARM is said to have ""cancelled license fees for the companies with financing amount lower than $5 million, to compete with its opponent RISC-V on the aspects of pricing."" And before Nvidia started taking an interest in ARM last Summer, they were considering selling off 2 of their IoT subsidiaries : RISC-V is impacting ARM."

Data going back to 1896 shows that as of April 2020, percentage-wise, the Dow Jones rose 857%. When Mars was within 30 degrees of the lunar node since 1896, the Dow rose 136%. When Mars was not within 30 degrees of the lunar node, the Dow rose 721%. Mars retrograde phases during the time Mars was within 30 degrees of the lunar node was not counted in that data as Mars being within 30 degrees of the lunar node."

Also, it‚Äôs easily one of the more nuanced Wall St movies. Paul Bellamy‚Äôs character‚Äôs monologue in the car about how much ‚Äúnormal people‚Äù have over-leveraged and benefited from shifty fuckers like them is still fascinating to me to this day. Not saying you have to take what he says at face value, but it‚Äôs still a POV you won‚Äôt hear as explicitly in other crisis-focused movies."
2021-06-30 14:02:51,wallstreetbets,"My problem with Margin Call is that you must have a pretty good pre-existing understanding of the 2008 financial crisis in order to understand the movie.  At no point do they ever really explain what is going on.  If you already know about the mechanisms of the crisis then you can infer that the fictional company is buying up mortgages and bundling them into mortgage backed securities, then selling those securities.  And the increase in defaults on mortgages is the risk factor that they didn't account for, which is going to devalue their portfolio and leave them with a pile of assets that nobody wants to buy.  Also they were able to buy those soon-to-be-worthless assets on huge leverage because they are viewed as a traditional and safe investment.

It is a great movie if you already understand those mechanisms, but it does a shit job of explaining them.  All the scenes where these items could be explained were instead just an intern pointing at graphs on a screen, which leads to increasingly higher level management characters shitting their pants for reasons that remain mysterious to the average viewer.

The Big Short does a much better job of explaining the mechanisms of the financial crisis in a way that connects the average viewer with the drama of the movie."

Spock explains how deep the shit they‚Äôre in is. They only mention it again as an acronym (MBS) I think during the fire sale. I‚Äôm going off memory, but I watch the movie a couple times a year.

I think it was a deliberate choice, as the CEO actually explains casually after listing all the bear markets of the last two centuries that ‚Äúwe just can‚Äôt help ourselves‚Äù almost as if the cause changes every crisis but the ‚Äúfat cats and starving dogs‚Äù feature in each one. So the film makers decided deliberately not to go more granular for the 2008 one and focus more on the humans and greed involved that permeates many of these mass fuckups in which the rich survive and people like the cleaning lady in the elevator scene are presumed to be toast. 

How effective that choice was honestly is debatable, because the Big Short demonstrated that you could explain a specific situation (2008) and to make it about more than just that situation.

Personally, I just _like_ Margin Call more, so different strokes for different folks. The acting, the dialogue and anything with Jeremy Irons at his most menacing yet charming is just fucking crack to me."

2021-06-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I analyzed last 15 years of news articles to see how many times Michael Burry predicted a crash and how many times he turned out to be right! Here are the results. **Preamble:** Michael Burry is definitely a controversial figure. He rose to fame betting against the subprime mortgage market and making a 489% return for his investors between Nov‚Äô00 and Jun‚Äô08 (SP500 returned just 3% in the same period).

But, I recently observed that in every news article/tweet, he always talks about an impending crash. As recently as last week, he issued another warning stating that there would a ‚Äúmother of all crashes soon due to the meme-stock and \*\*\*\*\*currency rally that will approach the size of countries‚Äù. Basically, what I wanted to analyze was

**Whether Michael Burry always predicts a crash and gets lucky when there is an actual crash or does his prediction actually turns out to be true most of the time?**

**Analysis**

The various news articles spanning over the last 15 years were obtained from Google News \[1\]. I flagged the date of each crash prediction and then analyzed the performance of the market/stock over the

a. Next 1 Month

b. Next 1 Quarter

c. Till Date

I will not be including the subprime mortgage crash prediction in this analysis as we all know how that turned out and how that made him famous. Also, there are no news reports covering Burry before that.

The performance figures are calculated based on the prediction. If Burry specifies a stock, then I am using that particular stock as the benchmark. If its broader prediction relating to the overall market, then the benchmark used is S&P 500.

**Results**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/y2bct7sphe871.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dd6d0b6163ad7ed0bfc917af373ce9f65bce71d)

There was a long gap of 9 years after the 2008 crash where Burry stayed out of the public view and did not make any warnings or predictions about the market.

His first verifiable prediction after the 2008 crisis [came in May 2017](https://www.lombardiletter.com/michael-burry-stock-market-crash/10895/) where he warned that we can expect a global financial meltdown and World War 3. In his exact words

>I didn‚Äôt go out looking for this, I just did the math. Every bit of my logic is telling me the global financial system is going to collapse

But it‚Äôs been 4 years since the prediction and the market is chugging along just fine. S&P500 has returned a respectable 93% to date and there is [no imminent threat](https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/timeline/) of a World War happening.

Burry‚Äôs next prediction was in [Sep 2019](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/the-big-short-s-michael-burry-explains-why-index-funds-are-like-subprime-cdos-1.1310874) where he said that index funds are the next market bubble and are comparable to subprime CDOs. He said that index fund inflows are now distorting prices for stocks and bonds in the same way that CDO purchases did for subprime mortgages more than a decade ago. He said the flows will reverse at some point, and ‚Äúit will be ugly‚Äù when they do.

This prediction also did not pan out as S&P500 has returned 50% to date over the last two years and the only crash that occurred during this period was the Covid-19 flash crash from which the market made a sudden recovery.

Burry‚Äôs next target was on Tesla where he said that Tesla‚Äôs stock price is [ridiculous](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-reveals-hes-short-tesla-tells-elon-musk-to-issue-more-stock-at-its-ridiculous-price/articleshow/79538731.cms) and that it would [collapse](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-predicts-tesla-stock-will-collapse-like-the-housing-bubble-enjoy-it-while-it-lasts/articleshow/80171258.cms) like the housing stock bubble. I have kept both the articles there which had only one month difference as we don‚Äôt know exactly when he shorted the stock. The returns would be substantially different if he did it in Dec‚Äô20 when compared to Jan‚Äô21 as Tesla had a phenomenal run in December.

He [reiterated](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-warns-the-stock-market-is-dancing-on-a-knifes-edge-and-fears-hes-being-ignored-again/articleshow/81154288.cms) again on Feb‚Äô21 that the market is dancing on a knife‚Äôs edge and he is being ignored again. He felt the boom in day traders due to the meme stock mania and the increasing cash flow to the index trackers would cause a massive bubble. This prediction also hasn‚Äôt turned out to be right as the market has returned 11% to date over the last 4 months.

Burry‚Äôs only prediction that we can say confidently was right after the 2008 mortgage crisis is that he called [\*\*\*coin a speculative bubble](https://moguldom.com/340499/michael-burry-who-predicted-2008-mortgage-crash-says-bitcoin-is-a-speculative-bubble-sends-prices-lower/) in March‚Äô21. \*\*\*coin has since dropped 28% in around 3 months. Even in this case, we don‚Äôt have enough data to showcase how this prediction would turn out over the next one/two years.  

Burry was most active in 2021 making the most number of predictions with the latest in Jun‚Äô21 stating that we are currently in the [greatest speculative bubble of all time](https://moguldom.com/358632/investor-michael-burry-who-predicted-2008-subprime-mortgage-crisis-says-this-is-greatest-speculative-bubble-of-all-time-in-all-things/). Only time will tell how this one will turn out!

**Conclusion**

I have immense respect for Michael Burry and his skills. He was a doctor and worked as a Stanford Hospital neurology resident and then left to start his own hedge fund that became [extremely successful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry). But, as you can see from the above analysis, he is more often wrong than right with his predictions \[2\].

But, the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately \[3\]. Out of the 100 predictions you make, even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high.

The key point here is that if you believe in Michael Burry, you will have to follow all of his recommendations \[4\] and not pick and choose what you feel comfortable with as most of the returns would be from an extremely unlikely scenario.

\[3\] Take the classic example of Keith Gill (aka DFV). He at one point had a $50MM return using a 50K call option. Even if he had another 99 50K call options in other stocks which expired worthless, just this one right pick would have made him a net profit of $45MM. This phenomenon is known as [black swan farming](http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html).

2021-06-30 09:36:46,wallstreetbets,He was also 3 years early on the 2008 crash. We are absolutely in a bubble. No one knows when it will pop. But it will. Until then I guess we‚Äôll just keep hitting ATH every day
2021-06-30 09:43:49,wallstreetbets,"Burry also admits that prior to getting the housing crisis correct, he was wrong several times. (Not wrong, early) he had to close out his short positions a few times over before getting it right. He talks openly about getting the timing way off, about how no way he ever thought the markets could continue as long as they had but somehow they did. I think it‚Äôs the same now - he sees where this all inevitably ends, but has underestimated how long it can go on before crashing so he is again several years too early. I don‚Äôt think he is wrong, he is just too early."
2021-06-30 10:26:28,wallstreetbets,What if Burry has been right every time and the market has been wrong üëÄ
2021-06-30 09:43:47,wallstreetbets,"One thing is a bit odd here:
He started predicting the 2008 crash LONG before, if I am not wrong, he began talking about the bubble in 2005. 

If he started 2017/2018 to talk about a crash again, that does not mean he was wrong. Just that he might be way too early again.

Edit: spelling

Edit2: I also would like everyone to remember how well the financial system can cling on to making everything seem just fine - remember 2007?

Also the FED has been pumping a fuckton of money into the system. Does that mean everything is healthy? It might be. Might also not."
2021-06-30 09:12:15,wallstreetbets,"The thing about being a bear since Volcker retired is that it‚Äôs damn near impossible to be right because the fed has been protecting it all. 

There‚Äôs a price to be paid for this at some point. At best we will look like Japan at some point, with overall flat equity markets for decades. At worst‚Ä¶. Who the fuck knows.

Edit: get that bag while you can fam; your kids are counting on you."
2021-06-30 09:53:50,wallstreetbets,"To be fair its pretty early to say whether his predictions are true or not yet, not that I agree they are. I mean wasn't he about a year early for the '08 bubble too? I think there will be some pullback thats related to coins or memestock stuff, probably not a collapse of any kind but I don't think he's completely off base."
2021-06-30 10:15:09,wallstreetbets,"If you are not investing or trading, you are literally losing money. We all know the dollar is losing long-term value as they print more. A job isn't enough, a savings account isn't enough to retire.

Unless you're a genius bear who can time dips perfectly, you must respect that the market can be retarded longer than you can be solvent.

I legitimately believe that aggressive investing now is more sensible than staying out of the market."

They say 3 months to 2-3 years before we start really feeling it, but imo I'll give it by this time next year. Nevermind the inflation in the housing market already. There are a lot of different ways the world economy can go tits up right now.

However, the printers have been working overtime to prevent exactly what Bury thought would happen and it seems like it was effective, at least in terms of doing the greater good to society during a time of need. Will inflation catch up with us? Yup, but it's the lesser evil. 

TL;DR Crash is still likely on the horizon, if GME wasn't stopped by a boy from bulgaria that likely would have caused a financial meltdown on an incredible scale."

His ""short the housing market"" efforts started in early 2005, and the crash didn't happen for almost 3 years.  He bought a bunch of water/utilities and farmland after that, a few years before the Flint water crisis, and years before Bill Gates decided to buy farms.  He bought GME at least a year before the big squeeze (credit though - he bought GME after DFV did).

2021-06-30 10:40:22,wallstreetbets,Remember he began shorting the housing market as early as 2005 so there was a 3 year gap in his predictions to become real. I think the market was going to crash but he didn‚Äôt account for the Fed bailing out equities and credit market. Still you have to be blind to not see that we are definitely in a bubble

2021-06-30 09:08:14,wallstreetbets,"""Resulting"" is the act of predicting tail risk events once and then assuming they are more likely to happen in the future. Resulting is brought on by emotional investing and not by a risk management process. Although predicting a single tail risk event and making a sizable bet makes for a good write up, it doesn't mean you can predict the future. Being able to consistently predict tail risk events and profit from it requires serious active management and teams of quants that challenge status quo in a systematic way. Unless you have the budget of Renaissance the odds are you were lucky in life to hit even one."

\- I read this morning that retail is only 10% of traders/investors, if true who TF is he kidding? This is BS and manipulation.

\- Predictions of ""another leg down"" and ""another crash"" were written/promoted in MSM since Mar. 2020. If anything, that has produced poor results and ""crashophobia"" for many individual investor/traders.

\- My opinion, Burry likely dealt with overwhelming guilt and probably worse after his big ""win"" I think he has ongoing mental health issues due in part to that, or perhaps he's just flat out as mature as a 12 year old.

I find it odd because imho, Burry is not good at politics. I think one of the reasons he was off with the housing crash is that he underestimated the willingness of the financial elite and politicians to postpone or ignore the coming crash hoping to avoid it rather than trying to fix it with unpopular measures."

My question on Burry is not whether he‚Äôs right or wrong on a crash. But whether he‚Äôs walking gloriously on TESLA puts or not. Making one prediction and stringing it rich does not make you a great forecaster BUT doing twice is a different ballgame,"

With the advisory committee being mixed on whether or not to recommend, many on social message boards are suggesting that the stock is the center of increasing short interest, creating an opportunity for a short squeeze. 

In fact, the stock has appeared several times on the Wall Street Bets message board, as well as other message boards around the web, pointing to what could be a major opportunity for both short and long-term profits. 

Retail investors are also pointing to the mixed opinion itself as a bullish argument for the stock. Afterall, while the opinion was mixed, 10 members of the advisory committee suggested that the drug should be approved, suggesting that the efficacy and safety results do support an approval while only eight members of the committee suggested rejecting the drug. 

Some argue that while the mixed results of the advisory committee meeting are concerning, the vote to approve was stronger than the vote to reject, suggesting that there‚Äôs a stronger chance of approval than rejection. 

Not to mention, with the mixed results likely leading to heavy short interest, there‚Äôs a great opportunity to profit by kicking the shorts out of their positions."

For instance maybe there‚Äôs three years left and we crash to a point 50% higher than now? Maybe there‚Äôs one year left and we only make it 10% higher than now and crash to 30% lower than now. Each of these scenarios require a drastically different approach."

I believe everyone reads what he says and it is then priced into the market so the big crash he warns about just balances out after a few days or weeks. He warned against the Index Fund bubble and this made a lot of bigger stocks slow down and go sideways as what he said got priced in. 

People still listen to him. He‚Äôs now talking about inflation, he shorted the 10 year yield. He‚Äôs probably just very early on things and the market is slower to react. The limit to this is the fact that the greatest algorithms and minds are continuously analysing the market and global news.

His worries about margin debt and inflation are right, JPow and Yellen are printing money like crazy. And every oberprinted currency will cause drastic inflation. Burry is just more worried than others, causing him to be carefull, quit the bull market and go short early."

All of his comments are true, the problem is the federal reserve and government will keep socializing the losses of private entities because corporations have been so irresponsible and the entire country would potentially collapse if they stopped supporting these markets. This is because they have kept the faucets on for years and have only pumped more money in instead of being smart and forcing these freeloading corps to actually make some fucking money. 

Until the treasury unloads its positions and the fed stops pushing interest rates down and starts raising the bubble will continue to grow. The only hope is that the unwinding is gradual instead of sharp, otherwise, here come the Oakies"

2021-06-30 15:54:13,wallstreetbets,Have we forgotten that burry owns a shit ton of farm land? Dude is an absolute G.
2021-06-30 15:54:35,wallstreetbets,Hes hunting for black swans
2021-06-30 16:03:06,wallstreetbets,Burry is like Peter Schiff. If you took Schiff's advice when gold was in the $300s you'd have made a killing. If you kept taking his advice you'd miss thousands of percent of gains.
2021-06-30 16:03:50,wallstreetbets,We didn't have the levels of quantitative easing 15 years ago. We're not seeing securities crash (yet?) but we're definitely experiencing inflation.
2021-06-30 16:06:52,wallstreetbets,"I believe in all this bubble, and like all the other bubbles that one will pop one day. We just need to stay focused and don't let the hf win this war. How long will this take and will our money be worth something after all? That makes me a little bit scared, but anyway I'm holding my stonks, they can only make me feel better."
2021-06-30 16:07:07,wallstreetbets,"You cannot judge him on warnings based on a month or a quarter out, that‚Äôs asinine. He has never traded on that basis or made those claims that I‚Äôve heard of. Your analysis sucks from the inception."
2021-06-30 16:16:24,wallstreetbets,"That was a interesting read. Nobody can ever be 100% accurate about the market (Unless they are from the future) I still believe he is wrong about shorting TSLA. 

As of right now, TSLA has almost no completion and they are the king of EV cars. With other companies such as Lucid Motors, Ford, and other car companies making EV cars, TSLA will have some competition and will continue to stay as kings of EV. I don‚Äôt think TSLA will crash all the way down to $100 or $50. I‚Äôm holding on to my TSLA shares"
2021-06-30 16:17:06,wallstreetbets,"Saying a crash is coming is like predicting the tides. They will always come and go. Timing the crashes is impossible. Burry is a clever man but no one has a crystal ball and he‚Äôs wrong just like everyone else on most stuff. 

We all have mostly the same data but traders don‚Äôt care about data anymore. They care about making money and if that means jumping on a dead business model or ignoring fundamentals then you can‚Äôt expect to be able to predict this stuff. 

It‚Äôs old skool vs new. The public loves an underdog and the two world are at odds. Both require respect but I like burry think we‚Äôre inside a huge investment bubble ready to pop this year or next. I‚Äôm getting worldwide depression, inflation vibes right now but somehow the can is getting kicked down the road."
2021-06-30 16:21:44,wallstreetbets,So what's the lesson here?  You only need to be right once?  It's easy to predict something that is at least partially cyclical?
2021-06-30 16:24:37,wallstreetbets,so the TLDR is he basically hit a FD back in 08 and hasn't been able to repeat it since. he belongs here.
2021-06-30 16:27:27,wallstreetbets,Just because the corrupt government has managed to delay it using printers and propaganda doesn't mean he's wrong.
2021-06-30 16:27:42,wallstreetbets,He's early / on a long enough time horizon he'll be right
2021-06-30 16:28:30,wallstreetbets,Can you put the TLDR at the top so I can know in 5 seconds what your point is and then scroll to the comments
2021-06-30 16:29:29,wallstreetbets,He's not wrong but everything hinges on the Fed.  If they keep printing the market won't go down but the real economy will be in shambles.
2021-06-30 16:34:47,wallstreetbets,Quality stuff. Conclusion: Time in the market beats timing the market!
2021-06-30 16:42:14,wallstreetbets,He is not entirely sane. World War 3 in 2017? Godzilla invading? ETFs collapsing? Helloooo-o.
2021-06-30 16:43:38,wallstreetbets,So what do you all do to protect your profits?? I'm up pretty decent on many of my stocks. Do I place a trailing stop loss on ALL of them?

2021-06-30 16:57:09,wallstreetbets,"The problem is market perfor.ance is not indicative of him being right since the system itself has been manipulated since 2008.

If markets were left to their own merits, he would be right.

Where he IS wrong is that he neglects to factor the monetary and fiscal reaction when he gives these hot takes.  Following what he says without the context of how to trade it makes his predictions worthless.  

It is just clickbait."
2021-06-30 17:05:42,wallstreetbets,Couldn't get through 2 paragraphs of this before the obvious bias of OP turned me completely off.
2021-06-30 17:11:50,wallstreetbets,"Out of 100 predictions you can be wrong 99 times but only need to be right once for your overall returns to be extremely high? Only if you‚Äôre betting on 100x+ odds, which is fairly rare."
2021-06-30 17:12:42,wallstreetbets,"489% between those dates equates to 26.05% return per year.

But that doesn't sound nearly as sexy."
2021-06-30 17:15:09,wallstreetbets,"First thought--If the global financial system does collapse, what difference does it make what investments we're in?

Second--Just about every famous or semi-famous ""expert"" is wrong more than they're right.  Some have been right only once, and as the country saying goes, ""Even a blind squirrel gets an acorn once in a while"".

Third--If you make the same prediction over and over, eventually you may be right.  Then you can brag about ""calling it"", but that doesn't mean you're good at predicting it.  To put it in sports terms, if I say the Twins (just to pick a team at random) are going to win the World Series, I may be right eventually, but does that make me a true expert?"
2021-06-30 17:24:43,wallstreetbets,"I don't have to follow everything someone says, and I don't have to trade it like you outlined. Shove it up your ass idiot."
2021-06-30 17:45:02,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate you taking the time to do this. I wanted to know the answer as this guy makes me nervous. I do know that he seems a bit arrogant and he was way early on the 2008 crash, wonder if he's just too early on the one he is predicting next."
2021-06-30 17:46:51,wallstreetbets,"A good metaphor would be someone who plays roulette by only betting on specific numbers.  They're going to be wrong most of the time, but even if 1 in 10 bets pays off that is very impressive/lucky.

They make money because they can afford to lose 9 (or more) times before a big payout.  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FOLLOW IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS UNLESS YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE THE MONEY."
2021-06-30 17:47:48,wallstreetbets,Do Peter Schiff next
2021-06-30 17:51:46,wallstreetbets,"His comments are meaningless without a timeframe attached to them. Of course there‚Äôs gonna be a large crash *eventually*

The problem is that he can always go back and reframe ‚Äúsoon‚Äù to be whatever timeline fits his comments."
2021-06-30 17:57:07,wallstreetbets,Saving this post for when the market crashes in 6 months
2021-06-30 17:58:20,wallstreetbets,Just watched this movie yesterday. I suppose you could say I‚Äôm somewhat of an expert
2021-06-30 17:59:00,wallstreetbets,"So, assuming we hold other stocks, do we get rid of them due to the impending crash?"
2021-06-30 18:05:02,wallstreetbets,"Maybe he thinks history will repeat itself, seems to me its the start of the roaring twenties. We should all know what happened in the thirties."
2021-06-30 18:17:40,wallstreetbets,Best you can do is follow the money the rest is a guess.
2021-06-30 18:21:31,wallstreetbets,Yup....keep our eyes open for black swan events to farm so we can all retire early!
2021-06-30 18:28:16,wallstreetbets,"Can anyone explain what would actually cause the crash? I understand that people start selling their stocks etc so the prices fall but even though stocks are overvalued, what‚Äôs to say prices don‚Äôt keep rising? What would actually cause people to start selling and for the prices to start falling?"
2021-06-30 18:28:58,wallstreetbets,Just call a crash every 8-12 years. That‚Äôs enough time for people to forget and fuck everything up again.
2021-06-30 18:40:34,wallstreetbets,Lol i see global financial meltdown and ww3 coulda happened last year if fed didn‚Äôt go brrrrrrrrrr
2021-06-30 18:43:58,wallstreetbets,"So basically he uses my beer pong/mini golf etc.. strategy.

Every time you just jokingly say something like, watch me nail this shot. If you don't, people just go along like yeah sure he was never gonna do that.

But then once in a while you actually nail that shot. And people think it's amazing, because you said it first.

They don't know you have said that for 14 years as long as they are not your closest friend."
2021-06-30 18:48:54,wallstreetbets,So what I got from this is that he is just making educated guesses like the rest of us. Got it. lol
2021-06-30 18:54:45,wallstreetbets,Market is not chugging along just fine. It‚Äôs a shit show ready to blow.
2021-06-30 18:58:50,wallstreetbets,Dr. Michael Burry
2021-06-30 19:02:21,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, the May 2017 prediction was partially right. If your end date was March 2020 you would feel very differently. Return probably wouldn't be awful though. Also, your scales are different for each column. The columns in the 20 percent ranges are different sizes so the positive looks better than the negative."
2021-06-30 19:12:05,wallstreetbets,"I respect Burry - he knows more about investing and medicine than probably all of us on this sub. However, he knows shit-all about history. He keeps comparing the current US situation with Weimar Germany - my dude, those Germans may have been rich but they weren't the literal foundation of the world's financial system.

Does he really think that if/when the US economy crashes, everyone will just go ""oh well :) "" and switch to yuan? Or euro? Or rouble? (LOLOLOL) If it were any other country out there, then sure, shit would get really bad for them. But for better or for worse, the Fed has the magic printer that goes brrrrr with the world's most reliable currency.

Now, granted, China is making waves and playing the long game to get yuan as the world's new reserve currency, but I don't think the rest of the world will be so eager to give them the keys. The lesser evil and all that...

Personally, I keep a pile of cash in my main investing account, trading stonks and stuff, and a smaller (but still pretty fucking big haha) pile of cash in a regular bank account, so even if the market crashes, I'll be able to sit it out for quite a while wihtout having to liquidate my investments. So it goes..."
2021-06-30 19:16:58,wallstreetbets,"I mean, the US was trillion in debt 20 years ago in Q1 2001. 

The US is now $28,000,000,000,000 in debt 20 years later. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that this debt is unsustainable. 

I keep wondering why all these billionaires keep wanting to leave earth and wonder is it is because they peeked behind the curtain and know we have either fucked the whole planet beyond redepemptiom, or war or civil war etc.

Anyways, yeah with house prices rising, more people not be able to afford stuff, biggest wealth transfer in history, I think the 2030 prediction of the great reset is possible and ""you will own nothing and be happy"" minus the happy part."
2021-06-30 19:18:02,wallstreetbets,"489% return between Nov‚Äô00 and Jun‚Äô08? ü§ëI'm up 516% just this quarter, and I eat fucking crayons."

2021-06-30 19:23:49,wallstreetbets,This post is way too good for WSB
2021-06-30 19:27:18,wallstreetbets,Didn't the market almost crash in 2017?
2021-06-30 19:27:26,wallstreetbets,"I may be early but I am not wrong. I'm not putting him on a pedestal but he definitely has more wrinkles in his brain than me so if he was my financial advisor I would definitely listen to his advice more than your advice because i would say he's probably smarter reading numbers than you or I  put together,  not arguing your love for Google searches but I'm sure theres more to Mike Burry than Google knows."
2021-06-30 19:35:39,wallstreetbets,A broken clock also gets it right sometimes. There will very likely be a crash in the future but that's just the way the stock market has always worked. You have boom and bust periods. Predicting a crash or bubble in the future doesn't exactly make him a prophet. Getting the timing right is a bit important here but he's never consistently managed that.
2021-06-30 19:37:43,wallstreetbets,I asked my buddy who works at IRS when the next financial crisis will be and he said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre already in it‚Äù its true we won‚Äôt know until its already crashed
2021-06-30 19:44:01,wallstreetbets,"There‚Äôs a reason he calls himself Cassandra. When you run the numbers and use your eyeballs, he‚Äôs probably right, but the market can stay irrational longer than something something"
2021-06-30 19:44:12,wallstreetbets,"I give it till 2023 for bubble to go boom, Burry is always too early with his bets. Hyperinflation should kick in sometime then, until then though we will see small signs of it like housing boom right now. Greedy investment banker hands all over real estate again."

2021-06-30 19:47:59,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for this analysis, op.

I definitely agree with the majority of comments that we're in a large speculative bubble currently and the results are yet  to be determined on some of Dr. Burry's predictions, but I vastly appreciate the work you've done and the perspective presented."
2021-06-30 19:50:30,wallstreetbets,"thanks for your research 
i think he has made a reputation as the 'sky is falling"" guy and sooner or later there is going to be a crash.
I think he gets waaayyy too much credit...Even a blind squirrel finds a nut once and then #oldtimeboomersaying"
2021-06-30 19:55:12,wallstreetbets,TLDR
2021-06-30 09:36:13,wallstreetbets,It's like predicting the end of the world: people will mainly remember the one time you were right.
2021-06-30 09:39:25,wallstreetbets,When moon Burry?
2021-06-30 10:16:56,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the pingback on my article! Google News alert search by date can be inconsistent and maddening. 

I'm not sure what your research plans are since I came in in the middle, but I bet you could have fun setting up Google News alerts for a person and associated keywords (like ""crash""), generating it as an RSS feed, and then using IFTTT to populate a Google Sheet from the feed. You could have a real-time chart of the person and the keyword you're looking at. 

It wouldn't be perfect, of course, because it's automated and there would be some context errors. But it'd be an interesting start."
2021-06-30 14:32:24,wallstreetbets,"It should be noted that the markets are artificially inflated due to covid legislation.
And honestly, QE has just been can kicking since 2008. Just like Japan, when they decided to use QE to prop up their markets, we are about to implode inturn. And yes shit did go south in 2017. 

Your entire post only shows you have the attention span of a Ritalin addicted ferret."
2021-06-30 17:13:52,wallstreetbets,"Too little data here dude.

The problem with this is that you also don‚Äôt know the things he did not say. 

For example people focus on the stock picks people pick‚Ä¶ but they don‚Äôt focus on what they didn‚Äôt buy. Both are very important pieces of information. 

If we‚Äôre wondering when burry raised an alarm then it‚Äôs equally important to look at when he didn‚Äôt and what the result during that period was. we‚Äôre looking for predictive consistency."
2021-06-30 10:22:20,wallstreetbets,yeah this is a huge bubble but its gonna keep going up unti it pops. might be tomorrow might be 5 years who knows
2021-06-30 13:42:08,wallstreetbets,"""I might be early, but im not wrong"""
2021-06-30 14:31:48,wallstreetbets,"We know exactly when the bubble will burst. It‚Äôs going to burst right before my call expirations and I will be too incompetent to pull out in time, then I will post on Reddit shouting, ‚ÄúNever pull out!‚Äù."
2021-06-30 10:31:38,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it's pretty remarkable how stupid people here can be to think he's ""wrong"" because the market went up a lot recently.... in the middle of what he called a bubble. It's almost like markets go up in a bubble! Wow!

People would have been right to call the dotcom bubble a bubble in '98 and it wouldn't have crashed for 2 years. That's the thing about bubbles... you can say that they are there and be 100% right, and then they can continue to go parabolic for years before crashing."
2021-06-30 12:13:18,wallstreetbets,"Right. But it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that the market is ALWAYS in a bubble or series of bubbles. The market has fundamentally changed over time and now there is so much speculation in the market that it is always inherently a bubble or bubbles.

People get freaked out about a ‚Äúbubble bursting‚Äù and either get super conservative or take all their money out. People listen to Burry talking about the bubble popping and think it‚Äôs a total societal meltdown. It‚Äôs dramatically over exaggerated. Hell, 99% of the tickers that this sub pushes are 100% speculative and are all riding a bubble. Without speculation and bubbles the market is ridiculously boring and not a great investment vehicle."
2021-06-30 16:42:36,wallstreetbets,"Well then you can just keep predicting that the bubble will pop and if time lines are no concern, well then, you'll always be right.

Dr. Burry has also been spouting a lot of social commentary I personally disagree with and have found utterly disappointing."
2021-06-30 12:31:06,wallstreetbets,"The calculation is then, if it were another 3 years (max imo), what is the cost of time out of market vs cost of capital loss and inability to buy a market correction dip when it happens. Personally, I‚Äôm letting some plays play out and increasing my cash position or liquid conservative position until I have a maybe 50% to buy potentially one of the juiciest dips ever."
2021-06-30 12:31:25,wallstreetbets,So YOLO 'til we NOMO?  Got it.

2021-06-30 15:59:05,wallstreetbets,I plan on riding the bubble to the top lol
2021-06-30 17:08:53,wallstreetbets,We are always in a bubble.
2021-06-30 13:28:14,wallstreetbets,why the fuck are we in a bubble lol. people keep saying this shit. The market is right where it would be if we never had covid.
2021-06-30 10:40:03,wallstreetbets,"Or, I mean, it doesn't pop, and we keep chugging along. SP500 regularly hit's ATM outside of recessions because, you know, economic growth"
2021-06-30 15:01:11,wallstreetbets,This.  OP dumb AF.
2021-06-30 14:05:13,wallstreetbets,if ur downside predictions are early you will lose money in the long run. predicting a crash years before it happens is not a sign of genius
2021-06-30 15:06:26,wallstreetbets,"Burrys prediction would need to account for high risk,  over leverage,  collision,  corruption,  catalysts etc.. 

So not to say he is ever wrong but if a governed official or a regulator ever turned a blind eye or gave an undeserved rating things could drag out for longer than expected, which makes people laugh and joke ""burry has predicted 15 of the last 4 crashes"" line.  

It's not that he was wrong it's that the economy is operating under a different set of rules that constantly change depending on money, power, ethics and repercussion of actions."
2021-06-30 13:19:56,wallstreetbets,"He literally knew and bet on it

How can you say no one knew"
2021-06-30 12:05:43,wallstreetbets,"I've been waiting for the housing bubble to pop for over a decade. Even the 2008 crash didn't lower housing prices in European cities enough for me to afford a condo, or a house."
2021-06-30 13:56:44,wallstreetbets,"Is this not just a result of quantitative easing and low interest rates?

Interest rate hikes will likely cause a correction, but not a full bubble-pop/ crash. 

And if we are going to see inflation, would we see it in the stock market first?

I guess I‚Äôm just trying to understand what‚Äôs causing the market to keep rising currently."
2021-06-30 14:15:41,wallstreetbets,"If history repeats itself. More than likely, the bubble will burst in the fall."
2021-06-30 14:17:40,wallstreetbets,"he almost got rekt to the tune of billions of dollars trying to catch that knife.

pro tip: wait for the trend to change, then short. there was no less than a dozen short signals at the beginning of the march 2020 breakdown (just the same as when the market flipped back bullish in may)

money printer go brrrrrrrrrrrr. what that means is the most likely scenario is a crash in the intrinsic value of the stock market, not the price."
2021-06-30 15:21:54,wallstreetbets,totally agree.  Its hard to say he was wrong in anything other than his timing.
2021-06-30 17:33:58,wallstreetbets,I give this bubble explicit permission to pop anytime between tomorrow and 2038. Once we hit 2038 I'm gearing up for retirement and revoke my consent. Hopefully you idiots lead me to enough 10 baggers before then that I retire and live off T-Bills or something.
2021-06-30 18:45:18,wallstreetbets,"If you guess for a binary outcome, crash yes/no and you can do it with a precision of +-5 years, it's starting to become just a coincidence.

I mean would we say the corona ""crash"" 2020 means that his 2017 guess was right? Will we say his 2017 guess for a crash in 2024 was right?

I can say now ""the markets will crash soon"". What is soon? How long is my guess valid? Am I right if the markets first does 200000% and then halves? Was that the crash I meant?

You doesn't know. He doesn't know. Stop guessing."
2021-06-30 18:54:00,wallstreetbets,"Yup, this. He's absolutely right. Current prices and market performance are absolutely detached from reality and untethered from actual performance. That will have consequences in due time."
2021-06-30 19:12:11,wallstreetbets,Maybe the dollar is dying and we‚Äôll hit ATH every day forever
2021-06-30 14:35:26,wallstreetbets,"Wow, what a genius - I don't know anyone else who thinks that we're in a bubble. Thank god for his infinite insight and wisdom."
2021-06-30 17:51:07,wallstreetbets,Oh look it's me. Burry himself. So kind of you to point the bubble out. Jeez what is this guy cracking wise?
2021-06-30 10:07:47,wallstreetbets,Yup.. the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent is some sage insight.
2021-06-30 12:31:58,wallstreetbets,I may be early but I'm not wrong
2021-06-30 12:52:18,wallstreetbets,Totally agree.
2021-06-30 13:13:01,wallstreetbets,ITS THE SAME THING
2021-06-30 13:34:20,wallstreetbets,"Being early works well enough if you are making a short bet. You can make that bet a few times over, and make huge amounts of money when it eventually pays off.

&#x200B;

Being a few years early and trying to warn investors is worthless. Historically, big crashes seem to wipe out around 3 years of growth. If you listen to his prediction 3 years early and pull out of the market to be safe, you end up losing money unless you can then perfectly time reentering the market at the bottom.

&#x200B;

He was at least 4 years early at predicting this next crash. So if it does not happen by the end of this year, and reduce the market by at least 50%, it's another worthless prediction, IMO.

&#x200B;

I know he'll be right eventually, and I don't think that will just be random chance necessarily. But I also don't think there is any reasonable way for me to make any sort of money off of his early predictions."
2021-06-30 12:04:38,wallstreetbets,"So can I also predict a market collapse without putting any timeline on it? So In fifteen years when there‚Äôs a market collapse I can say, ‚ÄúSee, told you so‚Äù?

The man is no prophet. To predict something happening ‚Äúat some point in the future‚Äù is not actionable. OP‚Äôs research illustrates that clearly."

2021-06-30 12:06:23,wallstreetbets,How far are we going to stretch it though? There is always going to be a market crash in the future.

2021-06-30 17:50:09,wallstreetbets,"Unpopular opinion, but the Great Recession didn't validate Burry. The housing market began to slow in 2005, and extreme financial tightness largely started, and resolved, from 4Q08 to 1Q09. People forget that the Fed ""tightened"" monetary policy in late 2008 (holding fast while stress indicators accelerated and nominal indicators declined) because of inflation worries.   
In a different world, we might have seen painful sectoral reconstruction with a far less severe labor market impact. CDS buyers like Burry and Watsa benefited from a favorable tightening, then loosening, of monetary policy.

Australia kept their nominal environment stable despite massive swings in commodity prices. Their unemployment rate peaked at 6.4% while iron ore experienced an 80% draw down."

It took a few years before it popped.
The housing bubble 2008l took several years before it popped.
It is fairly easy to spot bubbles, especially when they are over blown.  But the old ""the market can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent"" saying comes into play.  You gotta be very cautions betting on the bursting of the bubble.  When it happens, yes but gains can be made.  But until then it looks of frustration and likely losing bets."

You realize you can just say right now ""there will be a crash at some point in the future"" and that doesn't make you useful, and it definitely doesn't make you predictive just because you are right. 

Corrections always happen. It is always a matter of time. It is not ""predictive"" to say they will happen. So if you say in 2005 ""this is a bubble and it will crash SOON"" then your prediction is WRONG if it doesn't happen that year.

2021-06-30 13:43:26,wallstreetbets,"Because once bubble became a colloquial term, people forgot about seasonality and the business cycle. One of the fun things about bubbles is if they were actually accurately predicted they would never happen. Bubbles happen from huge investments into things people suddenly realize are (near) worthless, like the dotcom bubble and 08 (really started in 06 iirc) led by CDOs (which have been around since the 70s). It's the rush to get rid of all that, with no one wanting to buy it, and watching asset valuation go to 0 that causes the bubble. 

Right now you hear bubbles about ""the market"", housing, student debt, etc etc etc. But all that stuff is retaining/ increasing in value. Until that stops, you can't definitively call it a bubble. You can only say you believe it's over valued. Otherwise, people would recognize bubbles. Recognizing bubbles would inherently mitigate their effects to not mattering, as people would react early."

Did not happen though. I have a strong feeling we can compare the current situation with a game of musical chairs. The moment the music stops noone will actually notice, as there is too much noise. The moment the crowd realises all seats are already occupied it's too late. 

When will the music stop playing? No clue. But I have a hard time believing we have fixed the system since the last time a crash happened for the absolute last time because we finally learned our lesson. So the brief answer is: Eventually. And it might help having one hand on the chair already."

if you predict that the car accident is going to be because your brakes fail and you crash off the side of the bridge next week. And then that prediction happens in 2 weeks, not 1 week, you'll be early, not wrong. 

Burry specifies what exactly is going to cause a crash. It's not like he's just randomly yelling there's going to be a crash with no explanations.

The same thing happened in 08. He saw what was wrong, predicted exactly how the whole system was going to fail and made bank on it. The only thing he got wrong was exactly when it would happen. And the timing discrepancy can be attributed to wall street commiting fraud to save their valuables before the whole thing crashed."

2021-06-30 09:44:09,wallstreetbets,"As I said, his housing market prediction took a couple of years to come ‚Äòtrue‚Äô. A couple of months or even half a year seems a relative short time. So the fact that his Feb‚Äô 21 prediction for instance hasn‚Äôt come through yet and that markets went up 11% since then is hardly a disqualification. The housing market kept pumping for a year at least while he said it would all collapse. 

All I‚Äôm saying, some of his predictions are a bit too recent to call whether it was a good one or not."
2021-06-30 10:25:02,wallstreetbets,"The crash in 2008 would‚Äôve come sooner had the system not engaged in fraudulent behavior to keep itself  afloat. We‚Äôre likely in a similar situation here - he predicted an upcoming crash in 2017 but couldn‚Äôt have factored in COVID, which caused a crash for entirely unrelated reasons and which the government stepped in to mitigate with unprecedented spending. 

But the underlying conditions that prompted that prediction **have not changed; if anything, they‚Äôve worsened.** He was years early with his 2008 prediction and up until the crash we kept hitting ATH‚Äôs and everyone called him a kook, then the other shoe dropped. There is no reason to believe the same isn‚Äôt happening now ‚Äî with his calculations thrown off by the fed printing money to stop the bleeding. But that isn‚Äôt sustainable forever, and eventually the market is going to need to stand on its own merits. On that day, I think Burry will be right and these posts will seem very short-sighted."
2021-06-30 10:05:23,wallstreetbets,Burry never sets a specific date because he is smart enough to know that he isn't in control and doesn't decide when the dominos fall. What he does do is point out markers for market crashes. To say any info he gave related to that has been wrong or false is disingenuous.

2021-06-30 12:58:01,wallstreetbets,Hyperinflation will never happen without scarcity and barring some catastrophic event we wont have scarcity. People will just continue piling money into assets and the fed will just continue to not include those assets in the inflation calculation.

2021-06-30 17:30:04,wallstreetbets,"Most of the super rich money is tied up in investments, that IRS dump proved that, they take loans on investments vehicles. They live on the loans like we do income, they pay capital gains on what they cash out to pay the loans however they also can write off the gains with the losses so this is how they have an effective tax rate of zero. 

It also helps they turn most hobbies into a business so they can write it off, then due business on the private jet too.

2021-06-30 13:35:00,wallstreetbets,I think that‚Äôs a bit of a simplified view. Burry saw the incoming danger that almost nobody else was willing to acknowledge. Tons of people lost savings and pensions and homes and Burry made millions for himself and his investors because he was right. If it was as good as someone throwing shit at the wall many others would have seen it coming and capitalized on it too.
2021-06-30 13:46:10,wallstreetbets,"Your logic is sound, but your assumptions are not. Your whole conclusion is based on the premise that there's a crash once a decade (or a storm every two weeks on average). However, this isn't true, which negates the soundness of your argument. Of course, I suppose it depends on how lax your definition of crash is, but in the Burry sense, it's more like once every 24 years or so on average. 

None of this really matters anyway. We all know there will be another crash. Maybe next month. Maybe next year. Maybe 2, etc. It's largely irrelevant. Happy investing/gambling üôÇ"

2021-06-30 10:23:36,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Some here seem to think these crashes happen all the time. But fortunately, worldwide economy destroying crashes like 2008 are fairly rare. Even last years crash pales in comparison. That is not too say a large amount of people havent been hit really hard, but overall this was a minor dip. The S&P500 is already at the same level it was before the pandemic hit. Companies like amazon have hit record sales and construction is through the roof (which was a sector which totally collapsed in 2008 and beyond)."
2021-06-30 10:13:38,wallstreetbets,"True enough, but whats your point? No one gets it right every-time. He hit the bulls eye once, can he do it again? He might, but not when judging his predictions within a half year timespan. And obviously a lot of his predictions will not be true. Predicting the future is really difficult as it turns out. 

Again, my only point is that his predictions from this year and say the last quarter of last year are too soon to tell. ‚ÄòThe market did 11% for four months‚Äô is not conclusive enough to judge if there really are too many retail investors pumping prices or not. 

His WW3 prediction is obviously off the mark."
2021-06-30 10:02:57,wallstreetbets,Is there anyone who confidently predicts these crashes? I wouldn‚Äôt know anyone. Because it‚Äôs really difficult. Predicting two in a lifetime is already an impressive feat.
2021-06-30 19:18:34,wallstreetbets,"Hence my point if you‚Äôre always predicting a crash of course it will happen, there‚Äôs as many elevating factors that go against his thesis as there are for it. There‚Äôs probably way more against it, the economy is reopening and roaring, the fed won‚Äôt let a crash happen again, housing regulations are way more stringent etc."
2021-06-30 17:51:55,wallstreetbets,My prediction is the moment that the fed can't fix the market we'll see enormous hyper inflation a market collapse then the destruction of American democracy. Basically exactly what happened to Germany in the 20s and 30s.
2021-06-30 13:47:42,wallstreetbets,"Based on my quick google hyperinflation is defined as 50% over a one month period. That would mean that a Starbucks coffee that cost $5 at the start of 2020 would cost nearly $650 in 2021. 

I think we can agree that didn't happen."
2021-06-30 18:04:53,wallstreetbets,The USD no longer being the reserve currency or if China starts making better military tech than us‚Ä¶these are both plausible in the next 20 years and would be catastrophic for the US if they occur.
2021-06-30 13:24:24,wallstreetbets,"Realistically inflation is already far worse than 5% or even 10%. A quick look at prices over the last year of pretty much anything show that. Houses, used cars, graphics cards, gas, lumber, steel... everything."

2021-06-30 12:33:46,wallstreetbets,"Because Burry's theory is that we are in a bubble caused by artificially low interest rates caused by the fed printing money. This causes more speculation, more money in the markets,  more trading on margin, but also, inflation. 

If hyperinflation hits, the fed will be forced to increase the interest rates to reign that inflation, because if they don't a) people will start to burn things quickly because the prices won't let them eat, and b) there will be a debt crisis for the usa similar to those suffered by certain european countries as a result of the real state bubble."

2021-06-30 12:08:12,wallstreetbets,S&P 500 had already returned to it‚Äôs pre-crash peak a year ago (only about 4 months after the bottom). It‚Äôs now about 1000 points higher than that - another 30% or so.
2021-06-30 13:10:37,wallstreetbets,"Not really. The market crashes on average every 8 years (1993, 2001, 2008). The delay right now has a lot to do with Fed policy from QE and QT which will not prevent a crash, just delay or soften them (depending on what actually triggers it)."

2021-06-30 13:38:55,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs because supply and demand have not met because of a few months of production were lost due to the pandemic which caused shortages as you know. 

We had 2-3% deflation in 2020. Inflation jumped to about 5% in a short amount of time this year, but the FED believes it is temporary and will resolve once productivity rises. We have around 3-4% net inflation since 2020. It may rise more, but it will fall once we catch up on production and get back to work.

2021-06-30 13:38:28,wallstreetbets,"Yes I understand what you mean, but I personally don‚Äôt look at that as inflation.
Eventho I know that that will be looked at IMO as a scare tactic.

If you are in business you know prices don‚Äôt go down. For the simple reason that you can‚Äôt scale up creating more expenses and having the same amount of margin. You have to ‚¨ÜÔ∏è the price in order to supply the demand and stay in business.

Remember people consume WAY more than a decade ago. So yes prices continue to go up with or without ‚Äúinflation‚Äù. The real question is how many people can keep buying? Thats where in my opinion inflation comes in play. Scarcity not abundance.

I think inflation should be looked at how much money can we keep flowing not how much money is in the market. Remember we pretty much create money out of thine air and give it value. üôàü§£"
2021-06-30 18:36:20,wallstreetbets,"My rent went down this year - I can‚Äôt smell the inflation. Buying a house is a fools errand - horrible market, horrible commodity."
2021-06-30 13:55:29,wallstreetbets,"Burry's argument unfortunately rests on the Fed behaving in what is in the long term interest of the economy versus doing what keeps the music playing for another week/month/year.  The fed should have already stopped QE, but they won't even put a solid future date on when they'll even start tapering.  Bumping interest rates even slightly up seems like a dream.  There's a real possibility the Fed just lets inflation run wild while pretending it's transitory."
2021-06-30 16:13:48,wallstreetbets,The fed will never raise interest rates. No administration will allow it.

2021-06-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My $BNGO DCF model. High upside potential, high Short Interest. **TLDR: We have a short term PT of 13.97$ and a high squeeze potential. Even if the squeeze doesn't come through, it's a good investment opportunity.**

&#x200B;

We should be trading at 13.97$ right now IMO. This is my first DCF model, many assumptions/calculations may be wrong. And commas and dots should be the other way around, but I use this format usually so yeah sorry US xd.

What I tried to do was justify most predictions with analyst's expectations + our own expectations + compare it to ILMN's past growth when they had similar revenue levels so that we can get a more accurate PT.

Wanted to do a slightly different one from the one that Ragnaros did a while ago with different projections for the Revenue, Cost of revenue, OPEX, Tax expense, WACC and Terminal Growth Rate. I did not assume or take into account any cases for more dillution since we have plenty of cash available and we have recently paid of all our debt. The end result does not differ that much from the one Ragnaros did; what is important though is for how long we assume bionano will be able to maintain this assumptions in growth for all the above.

For instance if this model ends at 2030, the intrinsic value for the company right now would be 13,97$. On the other hand, if we finish the Cash Flow model in 2029, the present value would be 7,53$ (interestingly that's 0.01 off of friday's close).

I believe BNGO can maintain this growth rate until 2029 AT LEAST. Looking at the very conservative estimates our management has on our market, around a 1.93B revenue for 2029 is more than achievable.

Our market opportunity is definitely higher than the low single digit billion dollars, as Erik our CEO said in Q4 2020 ER (correct me if wrong).

This is much higher than the ‚Äúexpected‚Äù by the management on this image:

&#x200B;

This yearly revenue would be achieved by 2029 approximately, so as I said, this model until 2029 is guaranteed IMO which would give us a 7.45$ PT. Do not be discouraged if this price target leaves you bag holding haha; as I said this is just our guaranteed floor IMO and taking into account our CEO's comments regarding our TAM, our expected cash flow could be growing at this rate until much later than 2030 which means we have an actual intrinsic value of 13.97$.

Now, for the Revenue, OPEX and Cost of Sales growth calculations:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xmz2hbttee871.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ddf6847158f84c21ef1aafa02dde041c7a83e7e

Sorry for the horrible resolution and image cropping

As you can see I used ILMN's past revenues and COGS to see what a reasonable CAGR would be for each parameter. CAGR for the revenue when ILMN had a similar revenue to what we have now is ‚âà 70%; CAGR for OPEX (which I calculated from the sec fillings for each quarter, deducting Cost of Revenue from the other costs) is ‚âà 40%.

NOTE: I deducted 300M costs which were used for R&D and did not fall into de usual cost curve.

When it comes to the COGS, it was hard for me to establish a more accurate relation between Sales and COGS, I tried looking for a relation between % increase in sales and the subsequent % increase in COGS so that I could maybe see a reduction in costs per sale produced from economies of scale(don't know whether that even makes sense or not lol). However, I could not find any relation and I decided it would be enough with just calculating the COGS and using a CAGR. I ended up getting a 58.39% which is lower than the one Ragnaros got, but quite similar, which gave me confidence this could be somewhat accurate.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z37qio8vee871.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=a369f6650117b6ae8c1096dee55a1a0895d2db5b

As you can see I used different scenarios for Revenue, COGS and OPEX:

**-Revenue:** As I mentioned earlier, I used ILMN's revenue to get an idea of whether the expected Revenue growth was too high (ex. 90% on chartmill, Ark's 82% growth on genomics, seeking alpha's analyst...). Looking at ILMN's 70% CAGR, my 79.61% CAGR average for each case scenario with probabilities factored in does not seem too high; specially taking into account our 179% Q/Q growth in revenue for Q1 2021 and our EOY 16M expectations.

**-COGS:** The averag CAGR for COGS is 52.27% which I think is very realistic, looking at ILMN's CAGR of 58,39% and the ‚âà 45% CAGR from the Chartmill's model that Ragnaros also added on his post:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/563xkgfxee871.png?width=1323&format=png&auto=webp&s=f244e22fff5fc417887f163bfb929ddd62e5bbeb

**-OPEX:** You can read the explanation for OPEX growth in the DCF model image. To sum up, I got a 32.89% average CAGR taking into account ILMN's OPEX growth and a conservative 35% CAGR and optimistic 25% CAGR from our CFO's expectations.

**-Tax Expense:** I couldn't find an effective tax rate for BNGO, usually marginal tax rate is higher but to be conservative, I used a 21% rate (very conservative IMO).

**-WACC:** Got a bit higher one than Ragnaros with my calculations, I believe the WACC I got is accurate but it does not differ that much from Ragnaros' WACC.

**-Terminal Growth Rate:** 2.5% I believe is a decent prediction.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The enterprise value/share gives us a PT of **13.97$** or a 84.74% upside potential from 7.52$ on the last trading day.

*This model DOES NOT take into account the possibility of adding sequencing capabilities in the future (nano nozzle) which would significantly increase TAM and SP.*

As I said, please feel free to correct me on any miscalculations/mistakes/wrong assumptions.

BNGO is a great company with a bright future, if you are bag holding... hold strong ladies and gentlemen!

It's that time traders..OCGN has broken the $8.50 resistance level..Charts looking very bullish and if it can push past the $10.00 resistance level then it will easily go to $15 and beyond..They are partners with India's Bharat Biotech and have deals with over 40 other countries to roll out covid vaccines...There is alot of upside to this stock and I see nothing but good things in the future...OCGN is gonna print alot of dough for its bag holders...

Increase in Carnival bookings reflects pent-up demand, says Argus

Argus analyst John Staszak keeps his Buy rating and $35 price target on Carnival. The analyst cites the company's recent announcement that it would resume cruises from Galveston on July 3rd along with the management's update that advance Q2 bookings are up 45% from the prior quarter. Staszak adds that the increase in bookings reflects ""strong"" pent-up demand for cruise vacations and also boosts his FY22 EPS view to 80c from 36c."

2021-06-30 08:41:55,wallstreetbets,Bought thousands more this morning
2021-06-30 08:56:17,wallstreetbets,I originally bought in January around $20 and sold 6/15 for $28. I just don't see it rising much more. It was trading at $50 pre-covid and now has billions in additional debt. Even if things go perfectly from here it's going to be a long time before they recover. If it got closer to $20 I'd consider buying back in again.

2021-06-30 17:19:01,wallstreetbets,"Short it. Carnival will hemorrhage money for another year to at best. They sold half their fleet for scrap during the pandemic. Fuck no. You‚Äôre better off betting on airlines. 

I‚Äôm saying this because even when the times were good and they were at 106% capacity they barley made money. Even without anyone on the ship getting covid, they‚Äôd still have to operate at 80% capacity max

They‚Äôve done no business for a year and a half 

And don‚Äôt forget about the delta variant. Living on a cruise ship for a week-month is like living in an airport."
2021-06-30 08:31:49,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt think another wide scale shut down is likely. But if it happens, they will be bankrupt. 

On top of that, even if a lockdown doesn‚Äôt happen, just plain old consumer fear of being stuck on a ship could be enough to keep demand suppressed. 

Seems like a sure thing that cruises rebound. But they are a long way from being on the other side and they are losing literal billions every month. At some point that‚Äôs unsustainable."
2021-06-30 08:18:48,wallstreetbets,"All it takes is one Petri dish to set this thing off again. 

To the best of my knowledge this variant is highly transmissible compared to the original virus. The effects are worse and is even impacting fully vaccinated people. LA is asking people to mask up again, various cities globally are considering locking down or already have (Sydney). 

Not giving any financial advice here, only saying approach with caution especially with travel industry. And good luck

Edit: Afterthought. A lot of people consider this pandemic over with and will refuse getting a test for any purposes. This could sneak up on us quickly too."
2021-06-30 08:15:32,wallstreetbets,Lmao. I hear that. I almost got into it but decided to pick up more airlines for cheaper.

2021-06-30 08:36:26,wallstreetbets,"Your point is well reasoned, and I admit its a possibility. 
However, I do think that the US government wouldn't let CCL fail. Even in bankruptcy they'll position to stay and continue, they would just restructure their debt.

They were able to liquidate last year to stay around so I think there's more life in them than one more down turn.
But yea if another outbreak happens, it would push my projections out further.

The public has a short term memory."
2021-06-30 17:21:03,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs possible in Australia and the UK. Also, ‚Äúbeing stuck on a ship‚Äù is not what happened at the beginning of covid. People were locked in their rooms for a month. Many rooms on ships don‚Äôt have windows. Many seniors (target demographic) will also probably be put off by cruises after all the covid bs."
2021-06-30 08:58:37,wallstreetbets,"So far, Delta is only bad if you‚Äôre not vaccinated. Get a shot and don‚Äôt have to worry about it as much. Otherwise, there is going to be a culling of the herd so to speak because you‚Äôre not closing this country back up when there are vaccines available for anyone who wants one. If something changes and the vaccines are no longer effective things might change, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be where we are headed because of delta. That said I did sell my CCL last Friday after holding since $18. Twice I should have sold at $31 and felt that after a couple of cases on board it was no longer worth holding for me. Will possibly jump back in depending on the price action in the future."
2021-06-30 09:58:51,wallstreetbets,"Cruise ship people are nuts... Even during covid all I saw on FB was those people bitching about when can they get to take a cruise again... They are obsessed.

As long as things don't implode, they are going to be booked solid."

2021-06-30 11:05:11,wallstreetbets,"Especially if they restrict capacity. The biggest non covid obstacle to paying back their loans is how full they decide sail at, and how quickly they scale that up. They won‚Äôt have any trouble filling it up."

portugal is the first country to crack.  they just had a court rule on the issue of ""deaths while covid positive"" not being the same as ""deaths caused by covid"", and held that ""deaths while covid positive"" cannot be the basis for lockdowns or regulations.  it matters because PCR testing has extremely high false positive rates, so the ""deaths while covid positive"" number is wildly inflated.  overnight, the portuguese court legally wiped out over 90% of covid deaths in the country.

2021-06-30 07:53:56,wallstreetbets,Can you please say why you mentioned anything about fertility in your post as the only people I've seen who talk about vaccine fertility issues tend to be nutters?
2021-06-30 08:05:32,wallstreetbets,"Pfizer no longer needs deep freeze. No one ever talks about fertility except anti vaxxers. Cardiac issues didn't show up until after millions tried it, not during trials, so you cannot make the claim that covaxin wont have those effects once released to the general public."
2021-06-30 12:36:23,wallstreetbets,"nope.

the US number for ""excess deaths"" isn't raw death certificates.  it's raw death certificates that include the word ""covid"" (regardless of actual cause of death) combined with historical trends from other sources.  the CDC won't have actual for another 2+ years for the non-covid deaths.

in contrast, sweden has instant, unified, digital death records with their socialized healthcare system, they didn't do a lockdown, and their 2020 death rate is statistically in line with the last 10 years.  one of their health ministers even came out and said it on video.

and it matters in the US because there are undoubtedly a shitload of malpractice cases that were swept under the rug, intentionally mislabeled as covid deaths because they thought they'd be able to get away with it.  malpractice doesn't suddenly fall to zero during a pandemic."
2021-06-30 08:45:24,wallstreetbets,"I am a card-carrying, tinfoil-hat-wearing conspiracy theorist, and the only evidence I see to support the fertility risk is simply links back to another claim that the vaccines are linked to UN Agenda 21 and Bill Gates. It's never data, only ever pure speculation based on weirdly antisemitic projections.

Even if you are not antisemitic, the root and the sum total of the fertility claims is antisemitic.

It's the fuckin' aliens you gotta be worried about, man. They're using the coof to distract us. THe government, not the aliens."

Usually deatha per 1000 people is around 8.5.   2020 it was over 10.

Sweden's numbers are impressive though.  Barely a noticable uptick and it makes me wonder why they didn't see the increase.  I would guess it has something to do with their healthcare system"
2021-06-30 16:09:21,wallstreetbets,"You can't say, ""look it's in the papers"" when, in fact, everything I read does not mention it, most people around me 70% have been vaccinated and nobody I know was warned about that, the only information I've seen is that the antibodies don't fully protect newborns/breastfed babies."
2021-06-30 14:17:24,wallstreetbets,">572,000 more deaths in the US during 2020 than 2019.   About a 20% increase.    This is all deaths.

you're mixing a few things here.

some of the articles are counting covid marked certificates + the estimated from historicals on other sources.

some are using the raw numbers on the CDC site for causes of death, but those are only partials, and that data doesn't reflect comorbidities for that purpose.  for example, if you die with stage 4 cancer and you test positive for covid and you have obesity related cardiac arrest, your certificate says all 3, and the CDC's data on the site will actually present a single death in all 3 columns for causes of death.  journalists are counting that as 3 deaths, even though there's only one person and one death.

both of these sources inflate the ""excess deaths"" count.

i actually contacted the CDC personally on this.  they said i'd have to wait 2 years and then file a FOIA request if they don't make it available on the site.

this is a problem in data management.  the data that's available does not reflect how it's being characterized in the media or in politics.  sweden's numbers on the other hand are flat because they don't have this data problem."
2021-06-30 18:57:14,wallstreetbets,"Maybe you should read different papers. Never before in my life have I seen anything politicized and lied about as much as this whole covid thing. We have facebook and twitter citing the World health Organization while at the same time India might be giving the death penalty to a WHO member for lying about the effectiveness of ivermectin and causing people in India to die needlessly. The reasons for the lies are many but the biggest one is money. Did you know you cannot get an Emergency Use Authorization for a vaccine if there is a drug that can treat the disease effectively? I didn‚Äôt either until recently, but it sure put some stuff into perspective once I found out. I am all for a vaccine like the one Ocugen is offering because it is variolation which has been safely used since the colonial days with cowpox and smallpox. More than 200 years of data and safe use and this vaccine gives permanent immune response just like actually having the disease. Where as the pfizer and moderna vaccines are a brand new type that has no track record. Funny that the tried and true method has yet to gain approval here jn America whilst the experimental ones are being pushed like crazy.

I hope your vaccine works for you. There are growing reports of many problems surfacing from these vaccines. I will take a variolation type (dead virus) vaccine all day long but I am hesitant about anything so rushed and new. 

Everyone is pushing their own agenda in the chaos right now but to deny that people are having serious side affects from these new vaccines is just plain dishonest. All you have to do is spend five minutes looking. 

There is nothing conspiratorial or crazy about researching medical health decisions. In fact if you don‚Äôt try to find out as much as you can before taking a drug or getting a treatment honestly that makes you stupid. And to try to suppress someone else with a different point of view on the subject is even more stupid because it shows you really don‚Äôt care enough to inform yourself about an important decision like healthcare or in this case an investment in a company."
2021-06-30 19:41:14,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but show me one source that says that.

I spent my lunch trying to find a credible source about any covid vaccine and fertility, could not find one source at all, Facebook posts from my friend Sally's uncles buddy doesn't count.

You're right there is a lot of misinformation out there about covid, 90% of it seems to be telling people A: it's not serious, don't worry, or B: vaccines are dangerous, I heard it from someone with no credentials.

And they've found the vast majority of those claims are coming from a dozen people who definitely do not have science to back them up and they're still getting spread like wildfire."

We are also currently balancing at yesterday's Value Area High.

2021-06-30 07:06:15,wallstreetbets,"Perspective. I have been in a few plays before they took off on WSB and the common theme is once they got popular here they got shit on incessantly in the daily. 

$CLOV went in when it was down w 200 shares w cb $7.02. Chamath is a target and I was sick of it and I like the company and it is a disruptor. I have also played additional on first run up and have another 125 shares in play in addition to original. 

$TTCF I was in when beaten up and got a few $12.50 2023 LEAPS and up 48% rn. Then it got popular here and shit on by the daily again. Bots shills and the standard play book. Picked up a couple $20 2023 LEAPS when it dropped some and down on those as of yesterday, but look at yesterday and PM today. Also $25 Aug calls have had crazy activity last few days and reason for movement and bullish. 

Brings me to $SOFI and reason for the post. I bought same time as I did $CLOV. It was beaten down due to Chamath and targeted inside and outside of this sub. I think it is a helleva company and bought 5 2023 $12.50 LEAPS and up 70%. Last Friday when it dropped I picked up 2 $20 2023 LEAPS and shares Friday and Monday when it went down. I said for 3 weeks I was going to do a DD on it I liked it so much and finally did one Monday. 

My point to you is this. Do your research and have conviction in your plays. Either ignore the haters (there will always be haters) or come back at them to correct their FUD and know the facts and data.  

You do as you see fit, but I am holding and riding this shit to make money and I don‚Äôt give 2 fucks what they throw at me or my plays!

If you sell below $19.45, you are a clown selling below the point of most volume today.

We are now One Time Framing higher on the day.  Until this ends, expect the price to keep going higher and higher.

First target above is a revisit of the bottom of yesterday's single prints at $19.80.

Next target is the top of those single prints at $20.99.

Above that would be the top of the channel at $22.88.

All of these prices are very possible today with the market-generated information we have so far.

Don't expect there to be many dips as we continue to One Time Frame higher today, so the earlier you get in, the more advantageous."

As sellers keep being absorbed at this important level, they will eventually be exhausted, at which point we may see another go at $19.80.

Again, if we break $19.80 with volume, then $20.99 is the target.  May happen in Power Hour, so buckle up."

It won't be easy, but as long as we hold $19.45 in this current 30m period, we can break through $19.80 to be rewarded today with $20.99 followed by $22.88.

Do not let the bears win this battle as we have the upper hand.

2021-06-30 06:55:47,wallstreetbets,SOFI is legit. I think it was dumped due to lock up expiration but I bet not any significant number of shares were sold by previous holders. This is a 10 bagger spac.

Especially in the medicare market which is supposed to be in the trillions by 2025."
2021-06-30 14:49:25,wallstreetbets,What are you in at?
2021-06-30 14:52:06,wallstreetbets,"I think that would be foolish.

Look at the big picture.

Value has continued to migrate higher and today we've stayed above yesterday's upper volume distribution for the majority of the session.

These are all bullish elements even though we have not been able to take out $19.80...yet.

There was nothing about today that was ""bearish"" for this stock.  It wasn't a rocket yet, but still very bullish so far."

2021-06-30 07:44:46,wallstreetbets,"SI went from 60%-40% when the borrowed float jumped up so SI is still tremendously high just shorts are using other tactics to hide that fact.  The shorts are hoping they can keep pushing down long enough intrest will fade, but with WKHS being an EV company intrest is only growing.  So, if positive voulume can stay up the stock has major breakout potential.  üêé"

2021-06-30 07:02:35,wallstreetbets,This doesn't make me think it'll moon: https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast
2021-06-30 07:04:21,wallstreetbets,"Yea, no: https://investorplace.com/2021/06/buy-or-sell-sofi-stock-breaking-down-its-new-beginning/

Unless we're super early to the party??"
2021-06-30 07:04:45,wallstreetbets,"Still, it can not go up to infinity. The company may be good but I am certain it will have the Wallstreetbets movement: a sharp increase accompanied by a sharp decrease. So basically, a pump and dump."
2021-06-30 06:54:47,wallstreetbets,"Prove it. All the DD yesterday was removed by moderators. 
Can't find anything anywhere else on the internet about SOFI that would convince me it'll moon. 

I got a 60% return on AMC, why would SOFI do the same?"
2021-06-30 07:00:45,wallstreetbets,"I'm allergic to the word SPAC. Most of them are overpriced, or downright fradulent like Nikola motors."
2021-06-30 11:02:51,wallstreetbets,I Buy and hold.. also i Stay focused.. üöÄ
2021-06-30 11:11:08,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll take my 3k pennies any day bby
2021-06-30 09:27:25,wallstreetbets,Is AMC not popular anymore ? I didn‚Äôt get the text from my wife‚Äôs boyfriend
2021-06-30 16:11:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah yeah yeah. Every single CLOV bagholder on this reddit bought in at the single digits. Thing made it to 28 weeks ago but no one here bought in the teens, everyone is up üëç"
2021-06-30 16:19:37,wallstreetbets,"Not miserable at all, you dumbasses make me smile ‚ò∫"
2021-06-30 16:13:09,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you guys need to stop it, too. You all pretty much own the company now. Exactly where do you think this new money is coming from, another dimension? You're just trading amongst yourselves."
2021-06-30 08:47:53,wallstreetbets,Unless it‚Äôs overall talked about the most. Then it‚Äôs not mentioned at all.
2021-06-30 11:04:17,wallstreetbets,FleshGordon.. LOL
2021-06-30 08:51:01,wallstreetbets,No he just desperately wants someone to fuck him
2021-06-30 15:38:42,wallstreetbets,"My 500 shares are saying different, lol.  Dunno whether to average down or just hold"
2021-06-30 15:02:17,wallstreetbets,Get off my dick you keyboard warrior
2021-06-30 06:39:20,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt get why I get downvoted? I am giving you investment opportunity of your life where you can 20-30 times your money
2021-06-30 08:34:21,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I work at a Wendy‚Äôs in the back behind the damn dumpster. I have been downvoted every fucking time I bring up SDC. So although my karma goes up, I then bring up SDC and then get downvoted into oblivion."
2021-06-30 09:15:37,wallstreetbets,cloverocket prepared for lift off.
2021-06-30 10:59:31,wallstreetbets,what makes you think I am in loss. I am in green motherfucker. lol
2021-06-30 12:45:32,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs down fucking 10% this week my man.
2021-06-30 14:57:58,wallstreetbets,Apparently some ppl drill up ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£
2021-06-30 15:33:03,wallstreetbets,Ask your mom nerd
2021-06-30 15:04:14,wallstreetbets,Drilling is for the heavens!
2021-06-30 10:09:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but as you can see 40% SI of free float and 99% utilization don‚Äôt mean shit for the ones lending out shares, the cost to borrow is still like 7% on average. I have no trust that the system is fair so if the cost didn‚Äôt rocket by now, there‚Äôs no way it will change in the future by much. Until we hear some actual good news, not just lawsuit speculations. 

And I care about cost to borrow because that‚Äôs what forces shorts to cover usually."
2021-06-30 10:11:15,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs just estimations. The massive drop at the bell could have been actual selling pressure from people who bought at 7.
2021-06-30 09:01:56,wallstreetbets,"Almost always the $WKHS shorts shoot their load by 10 to at latest usually 11. Then the horse climbs. I buy almost daily, late am."
2021-06-30 09:00:46,wallstreetbets,There seems to usually be a dip between 10 and 11am so probably a good time. Who can say for that we will dip today though
2021-06-30 13:44:11,wallstreetbets,Im not worried. A bounce is coming soon I think
2021-06-30 10:27:00,wallstreetbets,So my updates are pretty worthless? :/
2021-06-30 13:54:22,wallstreetbets,And then some more SOFI
2021-06-30 13:09:08,wallstreetbets,"I was making a ""2 Girls One Cup"" analogy. LOL"
2021-06-30 16:18:57,wallstreetbets,"I think i worded it wrong. Im going to buy at $11. I‚Äôve got about 6-7 months to hold that much, until I need it."
2021-06-30 17:23:43,wallstreetbets,It most certainly is retarded
2021-06-30 10:17:35,wallstreetbets,And the next day after
2021-06-30 07:39:16,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, the hype being put into it without much solid DD.  It feels like a pump and dump personally which is why I bought in when I saw it being first mentioned and sold once I doubled my $10 lol"
2021-06-30 07:35:35,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-30 14:52:52,wallstreetbets,The volume heavy though it will shoot up
2021-06-30 14:56:34,wallstreetbets,"I have expiring calls, so if it does not moon like in an hour tmw they can become worthless so that‚Äôs on me, i have some shares I‚Äôll keep them"
2021-06-30 06:43:16,wallstreetbets,"Nope thats me, only if you've been at JBLM or camp Humphreys in the last 5 years"
2021-06-30 10:19:10,wallstreetbets,You posted at 9
2021-06-30 11:16:52,wallstreetbets,Splash zone kinda guy eh?
2021-06-30 07:34:38,wallstreetbets,Calls and make sure to own some shares so those can‚Äôt be lent out.   Short interest is only decreasing because more people are holding.  Every week is seeing higher lows‚Ä¶only a matter of time!!
2021-06-30 08:05:26,wallstreetbets,I own Aug 20 15c at $3.78 just doubled up yesterday
2021-06-30 07:39:33,wallstreetbets,No problemüëåüèæ
2021-06-30 15:09:33,wallstreetbets,Jesus what expiration?
2021-06-30 07:32:16,wallstreetbets,"You should smack Chamath on the butt and buy him some red bottoms. Oh wait, you can't. You got money in his scams"
2021-06-30 09:13:25,wallstreetbets,I just don't see why you would use something like 'shares available to short' as an argument for which stock is going to go up more.
2021-06-30 12:53:28,wallstreetbets,You know it. Bought $WKHS 21 times now over the past few weeks. Nearly every day I add more shares.
2021-06-30 11:42:50,wallstreetbets,Lolol I've seen this happen to meme stocks everytime before they fall off a cliff
2021-06-30 11:45:52,wallstreetbets,Doggy style
2021-06-30 10:26:26,wallstreetbets,Temporary. Watch $WKHS rebound strong
2021-06-30 06:58:33,wallstreetbets,"You could search this sub and find loads of DD, you know."
2021-06-30 06:55:44,wallstreetbets,Well that's the wrong question to ask.  WSB is currently buying off hype not DD it would seem. Sorry if these saps downvote you for being genuine
2021-06-30 09:03:23,wallstreetbets,Blocked this guy.
2021-06-30 12:11:16,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the issue is people want to put their life savings into a stock and have it 10x overnight, but reality doesn't jive with that. Read the DD, put your money where you feel most confident and be patient. Nothing has changed with CLOV, it's likely a matter of time as long as people keep buying up shares and holding."
2021-06-30 13:00:55,wallstreetbets,Red rocket
2021-06-30 11:31:29,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-30 09:34:33,wallstreetbets,ü§°
2021-06-30 09:23:04,wallstreetbets,"You ate the toxic crayons, didn't you?"
2021-06-30 09:22:28,wallstreetbets,^ Bad mind reading/assumptions.
2021-06-30 09:26:47,wallstreetbets,Lol look at the 13f they filed they also own GME ü§£
2021-06-30 08:01:39,wallstreetbets,Then why are you lmfao?
2021-06-30 12:59:58,wallstreetbets,"I think what you‚Äôre meaning to say is they have negative net income, which is true. Most growth companies are like this. WKHS does indeed have revenue, friend."
2021-06-30 11:12:27,wallstreetbets,"Eh, hard to say. $21 doesn‚Äôt seem unreasonable and could give a decent profit. 

Then again‚Ä¶"
2021-06-30 07:08:46,wallstreetbets,Sell calls then. Many ways to make money.
2021-06-30 07:03:26,wallstreetbets,you got some paper ass hands who probably always buys at the top and sells at the bottom
2021-06-30 06:57:36,wallstreetbets,"What? There's tons of DD on it here, just search."
2021-06-30 06:55:30,wallstreetbets,It won't
2021-06-30 07:04:43,wallstreetbets,Well many SPACs are good too. Just like regular stock you need to do DD. Sofi is a company first and was well known before Spac deal.
2021-06-30 11:16:29,wallstreetbets,I do wish you luck timing the market
2021-06-30 11:18:17,wallstreetbets,That's a new pair of vintage Jordans üëü
2021-06-30 16:45:21,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, see... that is not normal. Either you have a sever inferiority complex or someone has really hurt you in the past leaving you with unresolved emotional conflicts that requires drama for you to feel involved. Either way, it's not healthy."
2021-06-30 16:16:40,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, what we eat doesn't make you shit and who I fuck doesn't make you cum. 

Did you get burned? üò≠üò≠ Crying on WSB like a little bitch üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
2021-06-30 16:17:08,wallstreetbets,"Whaaaat, there is still a pool of money in the SHF not covering. Either way AMC apes chill, and owning the float is great for us, very big community also."
2021-06-30 15:02:57,wallstreetbets,"You desperate fuck, fuck you and fuck DIDI too"
2021-06-30 07:07:10,wallstreetbets,"It's a popular ticker thread, none of those include VIAC. It's as simple as wrong thread."
2021-06-30 09:02:23,wallstreetbets,Will be doing the same friend.
2021-06-30 09:02:42,wallstreetbets,Reasonably price target?
2021-06-30 13:46:30,wallstreetbets,If we fall below the lower VWAP level at $16.29 without a strong bounce then I‚Äôll begin getting a little hot under the collar‚Ä¶.
2021-06-30 10:28:48,wallstreetbets,Interest rate is very telling and it's changes. Shares available not so much but people do like those numbers more that percentages.
2021-06-30 13:55:21,wallstreetbets,And after that?
2021-06-30 13:11:37,wallstreetbets,"Over my head LOL. Laser focus on $WKHS. By the way, it's almost buy time again."
2021-06-30 08:30:43,wallstreetbets,Doubling is not too bad going! Can't be too careful with pump and dumps etc.
2021-06-30 07:38:10,wallstreetbets,"Because it's counties, you retard. 209 counties in the United States."
2021-06-30 14:59:56,wallstreetbets,"No shame in migrating risk like that when an option trade starts going against you. I never hold till worthless.

Good to keep the shares though."
2021-06-30 06:49:58,wallstreetbets,"Ok, at least I can take you off the list"
2021-06-30 10:20:28,wallstreetbets,Dude what are you saying? Market opened 830 and I posted 900 = 30 minutes.
2021-06-30 14:30:11,wallstreetbets,I almost wanna say that‚Äôs an understatement üò≥
2021-06-30 15:15:50,wallstreetbets,August 20 $15 strike. And some shares
2021-06-30 07:32:59,wallstreetbets,Intelligent and well thought out counter points.
2021-06-30 09:22:57,wallstreetbets,Gme has ruined everything.
2021-06-30 09:25:57,wallstreetbets,Because the Hedge funds can attack the shit out of SOFI today while they don't have much in the tank to fight CLOV. Just my opinion I guess after learning and watching stocks and numbers for a bit
2021-06-30 13:00:56,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve bought 10 times and look forward to the next!
2021-06-30 13:07:15,wallstreetbets,"Well, you gentlemen obviously have larger pockets than I.  I'm in with as much cheddar as I can afford to pony up."
2021-06-30 11:48:31,wallstreetbets,Wow you sound like an idiot shill.
2021-06-30 11:47:46,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt know what that means. Is that CHWY? BARK? WOOF?
2021-06-30 07:04:11,wallstreetbets,Thanks for all your help
2021-06-30 06:57:21,wallstreetbets,Surely something must drive the hype? Lol
2021-06-30 13:03:07,wallstreetbets,I'm too smooth brain to understand you
2021-06-30 11:37:51,wallstreetbets,Hmm maybe I'll buy back in (shares calls) after it goes sideways all day. The calls keep getting cheaper so I'll wait.
2021-06-30 09:46:51,wallstreetbets,How am I the clown? I'm not the one bag holding. I got out of the P&D.
2021-06-30 09:24:12,wallstreetbets,Good luck to you. Keep falling for the WSB PnD's.
2021-06-30 09:29:53,wallstreetbets,Yeah and percentage wise it's not even close. ü§£ü§£ü§£ GOOD LUCK TO YOU WITH YOUR PUMP AND DUMPS. I'll see myself out with 2200% gains.
2021-06-30 08:02:47,wallstreetbets,"I'm not surprised I just think it's funny, at the rate this sub moves every stock listed is going places hehe"
2021-06-30 11:16:19,wallstreetbets,It just needs to hit 20.5 doe
2021-06-30 07:00:06,wallstreetbets,"Most DD war removed by mods. Also most of these accounts were made around the same time, and have the same top comments. - Sorry if I'm skeptical."
2021-06-30 16:50:20,wallstreetbets,"Nah, perfect childhood and perfect life. CLOV did fuck me for 1k but I've since made it up with other stocks. Tried reasoning with you clowns but now I'm just going to enjoy the show instead. Keep riding that drill."
2021-06-30 16:18:37,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao yeah pointing out stupidity = crying on here ü§£ü§£ you clowns keep doing you, just stop begging on WSB for help already. No one likes beggers"
2021-06-30 15:04:23,wallstreetbets,Eat my ass fuctard. I‚Äôm gonna sell my shares $.25 below your buy in price just to fuck you over cock sucker
2021-06-30 09:13:26,wallstreetbets,"Ultimately I think it goes over $100. Not sure how far, depends on how diamond handed apes are. I have my sell limits set at $777 just to be safe."
2021-06-30 13:55:41,wallstreetbets,More SOFI
2021-06-30 13:14:28,wallstreetbets,Wish I had more chedder.
2021-06-30 07:43:32,wallstreetbets,Hahahahahahaha
2021-06-30 06:52:28,wallstreetbets,I still got time to be added back on:)
2021-06-30 10:21:24,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt really care that much but you posted that it will be over 16M in the first 30 mins of trading at 30 mins when it was 7M it‚Äôs really no problem it happens
2021-06-30 15:17:16,wallstreetbets,"Oh lmao ur fine then, def gonna print. I was fucking around with weeklies"
2021-06-30 07:34:00,wallstreetbets,Because I am a very well thought out and intelligent person
2021-06-30 09:34:13,wallstreetbets,"If you can specify which hedge fund(s) would attack SoFi by shorting and give a good reason as to why, I'm going to give you some credit."
2021-06-30 13:05:21,wallstreetbets,This is the way! $WKHS
2021-06-30 13:08:30,wallstreetbets,"Perhaps, but pay day is coming up, aka $WKHS time"
2021-06-30 11:51:11,wallstreetbets,Ah yes I forget that you can't predict that a stock will drop in price without being a shill even when the stock is dropping in price.
2021-06-30 07:30:58,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes it's shills?  Sometimes it's desperate members who want nothing more than the investment they bought ought of FOMO to come to fruition. Once in a great while, there's actually something more than a pump and dump occuring."
2021-06-30 13:03:42,wallstreetbets,Me too
2021-06-30 09:50:37,wallstreetbets,"You got out before the pump, a true retard"
2021-06-30 09:33:20,wallstreetbets,"Lol educate yourself my friend. Clov has more SI, higher cost to borrow for those shorts, and a better fundamental value than GME I did well on GME too but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the best play now. Are you still investing in IBM from the 90s too?"
2021-06-30 08:06:49,wallstreetbets,OK let¬¥s talk about $TUP ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
2021-06-30 07:12:17,wallstreetbets,Now is the most important time to be a skeptic.
2021-06-30 16:56:37,wallstreetbets,"Like, every post in your history is you arguing with someone. Maybe you would like to link me to your Financial Advisor business, articles written about your investment prowess and how you tuned $X into $Y, or the one about the miraculous pick of a stock before it made a run?

Those don't exist?

You seem to think you know more than everyone you come across on here, yet you are just another redditor with no special credentials at all. Delusional maybe? What ever it is, this activity in a search for attention is a reflection of some poor mental health.

I will not continue to participate, but I do hope you know there is a happier mental state that can be achieved."
2021-06-30 18:11:44,wallstreetbets,'the others stocks' you mean delivering pizza. 1k is chump change here
2021-06-30 16:24:37,wallstreetbets,I hope you make money off of all your stocks. We wanna fight amongst each other and forget we all have a common fucking enemy. Ffs
2021-06-30 16:21:02,wallstreetbets,"Nobody is asking for your help, nobody is slandering your stocks, and nobody wanted CLOV on the WSB ticker. I see stupid things everyday, I don't run and point them out to people who believe in those stupid ideas I don't agree with. 

You're honestly just a loser."
2021-06-30 15:09:23,wallstreetbets,"BHD01, I do believe the ball is in your court for a response... we're all waiting anxiously...."

2021-06-30 13:38:06,wallstreetbets,Pay day is coming up for millions of investors. I have started to refer to it as $WKHS loading day.
2021-06-30 07:44:15,wallstreetbets,"Bro, I can't even."
2021-06-30 10:22:30,wallstreetbets,You are right. Misread YahooFinance. Thanks.
2021-06-30 15:26:20,wallstreetbets,Hope we will both be fine
2021-06-30 12:07:25,wallstreetbets,And that is beyond my expertise as I am sure you guessed lol.. no credit for me
2021-06-30 11:56:43,wallstreetbets,"You said $15 EOD yesterday, stupid. 

It was green. And you‚Äôre at it again today because you‚Äôre stupid."
2021-06-30 09:51:32,wallstreetbets,What the fuck are you talking about you fuck? CLOV is never hitting 28 again. Be honest with yourself.
2021-06-30 09:38:55,wallstreetbets,"I can see your fighting this losing battle on multiple fronts lol. I'm not alone and it must suck to be reeled in this badly. I'm going to leave you be and you can deal with ""CLOV"" DD being removed and fighting other CLOV ""shills"" the real plays have been right in front of your eyes since November 2020 and it's your choice to ignore them for cheap chances at pay. I cheer for all retail so I can only hope you time the top before the massive rug pull that insues. Good luck my friend"
2021-06-30 08:52:13,wallstreetbets,Good company made some good gain back this last year
2021-06-30 16:58:25,wallstreetbets,"Lol cry harder, champ."
2021-06-30 16:28:21,wallstreetbets,Hey no one likes to see anyone lose money but I've given up trying to reason with people here so I've moved on to shaming. See if that works. Parking your money in a dying meme stock is dumb no matter how much you believe in it. That's money you could be putting elsewhere to make more money. If you believe in a stock long term so much you can always come back to it later. It's not going anywhere. But people dont listen. You guys want to proudly lose money then go ahead just dont be mad when you're made fun of. Ffs.
2021-06-30 15:09:14,wallstreetbets,Did I hear a broke bitch alarm go off?
2021-06-30 15:08:11,wallstreetbets,"Try 20,000 CLNE shares alone. I‚Äôd love to see your garbage ass portfolio you bought with food stamps"

2021-06-30 16:10:55,wallstreetbets,I already sold at a loss to avoid expiring worthless and I was fine with it. Good luck to you tho bro
2021-06-30 11:58:27,wallstreetbets,"I was a day or 2 early and that's fine because I'm already up on my puts

You being a moron cultist chearing for short squeezes that never happen while people like me make money is really what is stupid."
2021-06-30 10:32:44,wallstreetbets,I think you‚Äôre wrong which is why I‚Äôm holding up 20%
2021-06-30 09:41:11,wallstreetbets,You mean the 344 to 200 rug pull you got stuck bag holding GME with? But I‚Äôm with you rooting for retail. I hope you get a turn around. Just follow the facts friend.
2021-06-30 17:05:41,wallstreetbets,"I didn't think those links were coming... Cry over what, you are so sour you fail to even see I mentioned not one ticker here. I have no CLOV or AMC. Seriously, seek help."
2021-06-30 16:32:37,wallstreetbets,"I understand but it has no bearing on you financially man. I'm just saying..I wouldn't clown you if you got burned or if I thought your investment ideas were dumb.

2021-06-30 14:40:41,wallstreetbets,"When you see a repeated pattern like in CLNE when the price drops, stays low then recovers later repeatedly.  That's large buyers holding down the price to accumulate.  They will keep doing this before earnings in August.  This is actually great.  Accumulate where they do.  Save money for more buys later.  Buy in WIDE scales.  That means if you have 15k for buys. Buy $2,500 @ $10, when it drops buy $5,00@ $9, and if it gets to $8 buy $7,500.   In that example your cost basis would be $8.60."

Sweat from his excitement dripped passed his Sup3rst0nk tattoo on his forehead.  The scrolling ticker on CNBC shows the price of GME has now surpassed $10,000.

> I believed.  DFV, I fucking believed!

The now 74 year old man reflected on his 53 year old journey.  His mind and heart full of pride and gratitude to his now dead hero.

The man scrambled for his phone to finally hit the market sell button on his 4,000 shares.  He quickly scrolled passed the Cost Average box showing $480.

He was now a multi-millionaire, his goal ever since making his first GME purchase with his college tuition loans.  Never married because of his financial destitution and lack of college degree, he sprawled on the floor of his studio apartment and relieved himself on the floor as his toilet is still out of order from last month.

> The journey is over.  I was so right.

He sighed in reliief.

CNBC can still be heard blaring in the background intermingled with the police sirens and the man's neighbors orgy heard through the paper thin walls.

""In other news, inflation has broken another all time high and is at a record 140% this month alone, bringing the grand total to 69,420% since 50 years ago.  More at 9."""

It can easily be an $8bn by 2026, by expanding into 4 or 5 global spaceports. 3  of which are under negotiation e.g. italy, UAE. At that price the shares should be worth around $350-700, which is a 10-20x multiple on income. 

Today at $45 it's a ground floor bargain. And has great retail support and momentum potential to hit 80-100 in the next couple of months, imo.

Buy and hold this bitch to get it past 40 and the floodgates will open. Bears shitting themselves but watching it and not covering yet because recent dildos were short-lived. If it breaks 40, the moon is the ceiling and it will be parabolic for days as the shorts flood market with buy orders before they lose their ass."

I will say this though: take some profits when you are up. There is a tendency here to encourage traders to hold options until they either expire or pay the max. It cost me several thousand dollars to learn that sometimes you've just made a bad bet and nothing will fix it."

2021-06-30 06:44:58,wallstreetbets,"I think 10 is the soft floor and 9.50 is the hard floor. My thought are if I was considering getting in today I‚Äôd place buy orders for shares at $10 today and calls at 9.50 pick your strike based on risk tolerance. Plan to flip at open tomorrow if profitable. I don‚Äôt think it goes into the $8 range ever again but that‚Äôs me. 

I of course am sitting here with 7/16 calls $6 and $8 strike in addition to shares breakevens 10.80 and 11.20 on calls and average on shares of 11.80.

I‚Äôm not happy right now and I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do if it dips below $10"
2021-06-30 07:10:33,wallstreetbets,"Right!? Looked like it was rolling over couple weeks ago at $380 then just burst through the wall like Kool-Aid man. 

The $350-400 calls I bought when it dropped to the $320‚Äôs are happy"

Sometimes, if I'm lucky I get a 5-10% gain which I then sit on until the stock drops 30-50%. Next (this is important) I get impatient and pissed off and sell at a loss, and if I time it right, the stock usually rebounds for a few days after that and then it's on to the next one.

When comparing AMD to its competitors, like $NVDA, we can look at simple financial metrics, like revenue, net income, and the ""P/E ratio"", to determine that AMD certainly has room to grow.

Obviously it goes much deeper than that, and there is plenty of information on the web for you to read."

I don't know much about their supply chain for the natural gas but long term, semi's are probably going to need something else besided electric motors to run the distances they do. CLNE's deal with amazon also a pretty good indication that the Bezo's thinks that to.

Alot of it will depend on if CLNE can secure a good (sustainably green) nat gas supply and if current and future administrations are willing to swallow that Nat Gas is ""Clean""  


(I'm currently working with a company that is working on ""Feeding"" plant byproducts to microbes in abandoned/under performing nat gas wells to produce methane in a green manner. They are able to identify the gas produced from the feeding to the ones present. They are also able to sequester carbon underground to become carbon negative. If CLNE can secure a long term supply on something like that, they may have a business model that really works in a green future.)"

My take:

‚Ä¢ there is fuckery with gme  
‚Ä¢ there are institutions who've now *really* discovered wsb and how it works  
‚Ä¢ institutions capitalise off of wsb fomo and ignorance by promoting new meme stocks  
‚Ä¢ gmetards believe its to delay margin calls on gme, despite them being coincidental.

Ignorance is the driver behind all of this.

The fact remains that gmetards are doing ***everything*** any institution would want them to. Sequester themselves. Secluded themselves. Make themselves look insane and cultist.

I'm still long gme because I personally believe that no matter what kind of events happen... the company is going going demonstrate phenomenonal value and there is a ridiculous amount of leverage in derivatives. Some 40+m puts in July alone."

2021-06-30 08:23:23,wallstreetbets,"I was actually going to write about this and market breadth indicators in my weekly post which I ended up not finding the time to finish publish this week. Here's the bit I had about SKEW:  

https://imgur.com/LIify0s  
>SKEW is an interesting indicator. Usually ranging from 100 to 150, the former suggests normal perceived market returns and trends toward the latter suggest volatility ahead. Friday SKEW closed at it‚Äôs ATH, ~170. While historically it‚Äôs not been a good predictor of realized volatility as can be seen in the chart, it‚Äôs interesting in that it‚Äôs a measure of perceived risk in the markets, basically elevated expectations of a black swan event. So while you probably shouldn‚Äôt trade on it, it‚Äôs a view into market sentiment for the next 30 days.   

tl;dr technical-wise this past week is that I didn't notice anything threatening a continued move upward, and fundamentally and sentiment-wise I don't see anything on the horizon to initiate a pullback in the short term (~1-month)"

2021-06-30 08:09:17,wallstreetbets,"Pretty much yeah that‚Äôs the concern, although I don‚Äôt know that such a future concern would warrant these drops. Not that I expect the stock market to behave with the wisdom of public health in reaction to delta. The virus still has to mutate further before we are worried we maybe potentially could have another pandemic. That plus at least from a public health perspective we have more stable leadership and know a bit better now (not trying to get political but I work in healthcare and I think I‚Äôve earned the right to say incompetent leadership at the federal and state level across this country liberal and conservative fucked us hard).

Until I start seeing the volume of sick and dying patient I was seeing over the holiday season I‚Äôm not as concerned. This disease is much deadlier than the seasonal flu but in terms of the volume of patients I‚Äôm seeing with covid now, that‚Äôs about the volume I‚Äôm seeing on my unit. we‚Äôve even removed some of our negative pressure rooms.

Edit: that was ultimately why we had to lockdown was the volume of patients inundating hospitals: it‚Äôs a situation I hope to never see again... it fucked me up for a few months"

2021-06-30 08:55:29,wallstreetbets,"Thank you; it‚Äôs enough just to hear it occasionally. I really do love healthcare as while I do shitpost and bully apes here I actually am a really empathetic person and there‚Äôs nothing more rewarding to me than seeing a patient get better or at the very least not suffer; so believe me when I say it‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do until I retire even if I hit it big in the stock market someday.

TL;DR: vaccinations and future outbreaks will likely be local to regions with low vaccination below 80%. 90-95% is ideal.
In terms of January it‚Äôs an unknown. It‚Äôs possible this is seasonal. We also don‚Äôt know the length of immunity from vaccines. The worst time would be Thanksgiving through the end of January for an airborne transmissible disease.


To answer your questions:

I think one of the things I forgot to mention is the regionality we are likely going to be looking at with future outbreaks. Right now it‚Äôs affecting areas globally and in the states where vaccination is subpar. I think we‚Äôd see somewhat effective herd immunity in a state or region with 80-85%. The Ideal would be 90-95% (there are some people who can‚Äôt get vaccinated for legitimate health reasons and that‚Äôs why we push for herd immunity, it will never be 100%).
I have a friend in Maryland and they aren‚Äôt wearing masks in public at all because if I recall they are at 90%.

Over the next 6 months We‚Äôll likely see small epidemics in regions and localities where vaccination is lower... thus the delta variant... Florida mans covid. In terms of the patients I‚Äôm seeing now with covid, the good news is that we are seeing that the average age is decreasing. We‚Äôre no longer getting 80-90 year nursing home residents but now 40-60 year olds who either weren‚Äôt vaccinated or were in the process of getting the series. I am still seeing the occasional patient that goes on or came in on hospice with a morphine drip (so they go in peace) but it‚Äôs no longer 5 or 6 over a three shift rotation.

In terms of a wave 4, truth be told that‚Äôs the major unknown at this point. There‚Äôs concern that this could be a disease that ends up being seasonal like the flu. I think the fact we‚Äôve seen so many variants pop up that the big 3 vaccines are effective against looks good but I have a very basic education in Microbio as required by my current nursing school. If we were to see a new outbreak not covered by the vaccine in the US I‚Äôd pin Thanksgiving- New Years as both the most likely and worst case scenario for an airborne transmissible disease.

To be clear I‚Äôm a nursing student graduating in December (hopefully) but I‚Äôve worked years as a telemetry tech and my area of interest/expertise is cardiac electrophysiology as well as the general physiology of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems."

Using a third-party might save some money on building a factory, but you are paying more to build the cars and your development time will be slower.

Sorry, this whole thing about using a third-party to build the cars right now sounds more like some BS to tell gullible investors rather than an explanation as to how you make EV's profitably at this time."
2021-06-30 03:34:30,wallstreetbets,Get in now before it gets hot! Before it's even listed yet! Wait
2021-06-30 03:09:44,wallstreetbets,neither does Tesla
2021-06-30 00:11:30,wallstreetbets,same too. it gonna benefit from the new bill.
2021-06-30 01:27:08,wallstreetbets,...except the $7500 tax credit.
2021-06-30 09:08:53,wallstreetbets,"Ford has more name recognition than Tesla, especially the people who have relied on the F-150 in the past for work. The regular F-150 is also the most highly sold truck and the Lightening F-150 would be an upgrade."
2021-06-30 10:43:12,wallstreetbets,"Never said that it made them magically profitable. However, fisker has 1B in cash and no debt. Moreover, lordstown manufacturing EVs for them allows Fisker to not have their capital tied up in inventory, since it is on a manufacture by order basis."
2021-06-30 08:08:37,wallstreetbets,This is about the near future.  These are the three companies with near-term plans to break the under-$30K segment.
2021-06-30 02:04:23,wallstreetbets,"Once you hit 200,000 in sales the credit phases out. Ford is at 134,195 as of 3/31/2021. By year end they will probably be between 150,000 - 170,000, and if they get the lighting out, they will probably cross the 200,000 threshold by middle of 2022.

Basically, if the F-150 Lightning is a success the credit will phase out before many can benefit from it.

In any case the credit is not much of a help here (assuming both Tesla's and Ford's pricing remains consistent). My understanding is very few people are opting for the base CT, rather most are getting the Dual Motor or Tri-Motor versions. The Dual-Motor has 300 miles of range and costs $50K. Ignoring many of the features, the F-150 Lighting XLT with an extended battery will run about $63K, so even with the credit you are still paying more for the Ford. The Pro version with the extended battery will cost about $50K, but frankly would not expect to see that version anytime soon. Also not discussing here features like the locking bed and air suspension, which might be a huge deal for people."
2021-06-30 09:04:38,wallstreetbets,I haven't seen the lightning yet but I feel like maybe it wins in appearance/ design as well?
2021-06-30 01:28:39,wallstreetbets,Fair point. In a more ideal world Biden would push through the additional EV credits.
2021-06-30 11:10:01,wallstreetbets,"Lordstown does not have the money to build out the production lines for their own vehicle (the Endurance). Where are they getting money to build a production line for Fisker? And if Fisker pays to build the production line (mind you, in an old and inefficient factory for EV production) what did Fisker save?

This imaginary synergies will not make anyone money.

As to 1B in cash... How about you look at the last 3 years of NIO's operating results (the time they have been making EV's) and let us know the amount they have lost so far on operations... I think about 2.5B. How about think about how much money Tesla has spent on building out their production capability. How about the tens of billions GM and VW have committed to producing EV's... Frankly, 1B might sound like a lot, but Fisker better hope it gets them to a production level that they can piggy-back off that to raise more funds in the market, because they will need more money."
2021-06-30 11:17:50,wallstreetbets,"Magna also manufactures for them and holds a 7.4% stake in Fisker. Agreed, Fisker will need more cash to build out production capability, but they are still in the very early stages. Comparing NIO to FSK doesn't make sense, NIO is focused on batteries and is based in China, which has a different EV market than the US. In addition, NIO is trying to scale its battery swapping stations and investing heavily, while FSK is less of a car company and more of a design company. FSK plans to lease out the cars directly to consumers and the consumer doesn't sign a binding agreement, meaning that they can turn the vehicle in whenever. Fisker does have a long time to go and there is a lot of room for error, but there is also room for reward if things go right."
2021-06-30 11:29:15,wallstreetbets,"Listen to the folks at GOEV and they said that leasing makes no sense because it is too capital intensive. Leasing also does not make you profitable unless your lease rates are reflective of a high enough sales price to cover the costs and some extra.

As to room to profit, there is no room. Fisker has done next to nothing other than announce one plan after another and abandon them over time, only to go on to Henrik drawing a new picture of a car and convincing people that it will produced eventually one day..."

2021-06-30 05:27:29,wallstreetbets,"Their dividend is still above 3%. Their streaming service will blow netflix out water. They have a boat load of customers.

2021-06-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Case for Cd Projekt Red (OTGLY) Not going to make this long - OTGLY is [severely undervalued](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/OTGLY/summary) at the moment. 

Anyone following the company knows it's been through rough times - messed up the Cyberpunk launch, screwed up with the previous-gen consoles, got a lawsuit from its own shareholders, got hacked, lost the director for Witcher 3... and eventually lost more than 60% of its value.

So why should you buy it? Obviously, 'cause this is the dip, people. Well, simians. 

First of all, this ain't no financial advice. I am 10k into the stock at 12.40$. Should have bought at the deeper dip (went as low as 10.5 at some point), but I was busy shaving my balls. 

However - look at the company. 

1. It's financially very stable (last year was the most profitable year it ever had. More than 300 million dollars in NET PROFIT)
2. It has an excellent cash flow and no debt. 
3. It's expanding so it can work on two AAA games at the same time.
4. It has just [fixed](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-06-27-cdpr-is-now-satisfied-with-cyberpunk-2077) the major bugs and problems it had with Cyberpunk.
5. Cyberpunk is [returning to the PlayStation store](https://www.polygon.com/22229742/cyberpunk-2077-returns-to-playstation-store-release-refund-ps4-ps5-cd-projekt-red).
6.  [Witcher](https://gamerant.com/cd-projekt-red-new-aaa-game-witcher-4/) 4. I mean, that's a money-making machine, and CD Projekt is hiring new blood. They are most definitely working on it, even if it's too soon for an announcement. 

I'm not going to confuse you with any graphs, I can barely read them myself. It reached all times low lately, and I believe a recovery is afoot. It might take a year, it might be just a couple of months, but you're looking at 30%-50% upside.     

Note that volume is very low at the moment, meaning it's no pump N' dump scam. It's not scary low (Don't buy OTGLF, it's impossible to get rid of it, stick to OTGLY), but it's not lively.  

Is this a YOLO-worthy stock? No. It's a well-calculated bet on a gorgeous video game company that screwed up and is now trying to make amends. I'm going for it. Might add an extra 10K if I ever finish smoothing my other ball. 

Also, it's being shorted like crazy, but that's less my thing."

2021-06-30 01:16:09,wallstreetbets,Even with the bugs fixed CP 2077 is very underwhelming. Had lots of potential but it is not worth saving.
2021-06-29 21:28:37,wallstreetbets,Last year was profitable because of the hype around Cyberpunk 2077 and launch. But since then sales numbers and active player counts have dropped. It‚Äôs unlikely they can repeat the profits from last year.
2021-06-29 21:37:53,wallstreetbets,"I saw a video of a bunch of terrible bugs on the Cyberpunk subreddits that the game devs apparently made and passed around 3 weeks before the launch date. 

To me if the devs knew the game was not ready and it turned into this much of a release flop then there's a problem with management and I wouldn't personally buy any stock until there's management changes"
2021-06-29 23:28:08,wallstreetbets,"They released a game that was just terribly bugged. It‚Äôs unfortunate, but management would have known about this. I refuse to believe the game was not tested on older consoles, newer consoles, PC‚Äôs, etc. This thought alone scares me that they would essentially false advertise the quality of their products to customers. I will not invest until the company proves to me it is capable of producing the product it advertises. As a gamer I sincerely hope it can do so, but best of luck to anyone that invests currently. May the tendies be ever in your favor!"

Wotcher 3 releases and is very buggy but still a great game. Then they add two incredible expansions and when all is said and done they made ln of the greatest games of the decade. 

They followed that up with cyberpunk. They had all the good faith you can have from gamers. 
They had great PR 
""We dont crunch our employees and make them work crazy hours"" -spoiler, they did. 
""This game will be ready by A date -spoiler, it wasn't ready until S date. With constant promises it'll be ready by ABC etc. 
They lost some of their best employees from the span of development for cyberpunk. Pissed off most of there fans with a horrible release after almost 2 years of game push backs. And now they are doing two games instead of one. Which is a horrifying thought. 

All this to say this stock is going down again when the next two games they have are buggy as hell. Dont recommend being long on this company."

https://m.canadianinsider.com/voyager-digital-files-preliminary-short-form-base-shelf-prospectus

Picked up about 1,000 shares. Not a lot but honest work.

Ticker: VYGVF the market has not realized yet that Voyager has started to buy back its stock. 

Yesterday through Canadian filings we can see they started purchasing back stocks. 

They got approval to purchase and cancel up to 5% of their stocks. 

https://m.canadianinsider.com/company?ticker=VYGR

They have not provided a business update over May and June but based on some interviews they may have expanded up to 30% of their funded accounts. 

This buyback is not much of a surprise to me. Given Steve E. Knowledge of markets and market tools and given that Voyager is waiting for regulatory components for expansion why not use their excess cash to reduce their outstanding shares.

Voyager remains a very desirable target for large expansion or even acquisition. 

$100 average revenue per customer could grow much further as there is large cross sell opportunities. 

There is also a potential that it could create a short squeeze given the large volume of daily shares shorted."

Blackberry is dancing with the giants and we all should pay attention who they are hanging around with and what they are up to. 

Blackberry has a pending patent sale which initially started at IP licensing lawsuit against Facebook and may well become a Facebook partnership. 

Investors are excited about the patent sale and Facebook is a likely candidate but it has taken a long time and negotiations behind closed doors may be about more than just patent sale. A Blackberry Facebook partnership is eminent. 

Facebook announced recently that the are launching WhatsApp stores. Extending their WhatsApp Messenger for Enterprise with premium. Blackberry may be securing WhatsApp Messenger. 50/50 split on premium. 

John Chen is not stupid. He ain't taking cash and walking away. Partnership is the only language he understands. 

When asked about patent sale, John Chen said stay tuned. He meant don't sell. Good News Coming. 

I believe Facebook and Blackberry are working on a partnership agreement. Facebook like many others doesn't really to be left out. 

Who isn't partnering with Blackberry these days.

1. The price off the lot will push many people to where they can't afford a car at all, turning personal transport into a virtue signally tool for the wealthy
2. As much as 25% of US dollars are abroad and used for trading petroleum, if the demand for oil really drops, that could add to the already plummeting dollar and cause hyper inflation"

#What is Autohome?

&#x200B;

Autohome is a Chinese holding company founded in the late 2000s that provides online platforms for dealers and people selling used cars. Their websites are a medium for car sales, used or new. They also profit off of advertising, financial services for these sales, and offer data analytical tools for sales and marketing solutions to their automaker and dealer customers. Their data products consist of automaker data products such as Intelligent R&D, Intelligent New Car Launch, Intelligent Marketing, and Intelligent Activities and end-to-end SaaS-based services to dealers, such as Intelligent Showroom, Smart DCC (direct call center), Smart Call Out, Smart Assistant, Smart Sales, and Smart Aftersales. Their market cap sits just shy of 10 billion, although I‚Äôll get more into their fundamentals later.

&#x200B;

#What‚Äôs the case?

&#x200B;

Well first off, to give some context to the numbers I‚Äôm about to throw out, here‚Äôs a quick look at Autohome‚Äôs

&#x200B;

[2-year chart](https://preview.redd.it/ieuq32neoa871.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc9a3356406258bb383d02727f4220e3ca3db2de)

&#x200B;

[And 5-year chart](https://preview.redd.it/43pkg2neoa871.png?width=1364&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0f79e916bff682d7eebc59049824e2abafe709f)

Autohome recently released their first-quarter results, with some fairly significant highlights:

Net Revenues increasing to 281.1 million, a 19.1% increase YoY.

Online marketplace and other revenues at 82.3 million, a 74% increase YoY.

Their Data Products, a large part of why their R&D has increased heavily and caused present returns to be discounted in favor of future growth increased 64.9% YoY.

Their adjusted net income increased to 112.2 million, a 13& increase YoY.

&#x200B;

These numbers may not seem explosive, but their growth in the industry is incredibly consistent. Again, they‚Äôve upped their R&D costs for the sake of expanding a few things: their Data Products, their expansion into NEV or New Energy Vehicles (a term used by the Chinese government for plug-in electric vehicles), and their continued development of their apps/websites which Chairman of the board Quan Long (fantastic name by the way) discusses as important parts of the digital transformation taking place in the automotive industry. Their product development is about to be upwards of 50 million per quarter as they continue to roll out initiatives such as ‚ÄúAI, Big data and Cloud capability, and SaaS strategies‚Äù.

&#x200B;

Now you might ask why the stock is down so much in the context of the highs seen over the past 5 years, and for the love of god I hate to say it, but part of that was due to the spike you can see over January/February. Why, you might ask? Because people picked up that Autohome had a larger than average short position, every news site began releasing lists of companies prime to be the ‚Äúnext Gamestop‚Äù, and the stock jumped. This happened to coincide with earnings, and when earnings came out and people realized Autohome wasn‚Äôt selling the Nintendo switch and Pokemon plushies to greasy middle aged white men, the stock fell right back down to the previous range of hovering around 100 dollars per share. This downward momentum put a nice stain on earnings, and when Autohome released earnings recently in May, missing consensus EPS by 1 cent along with Chinese car sales dropping to 2019 levels due to Covid and the steel and chip shortage, the stock continued to fall down to where we see it today; with a consensus price target of $96.05.

&#x200B;

#Why I believe this is no longer a falling knife

[Autohome and its trendiness](https://preview.redd.it/cob1u2neoa871.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=33b865e82e4861d85f283e9c089f8620b73aae09)

As we can see on the 2-year chart, there‚Äôs fairly substantial support around 60-65 dollars, where the stock has bounced off of multiple times in the past few years. Even after continually falling for months, the current value of $65.69 sits well below the 50/100/200 day moving averages, a pattern that has repeatedly indicated reversals in the past.

&#x200B;

[Autohome MACD and EMA](https://preview.redd.it/i76nrloeoa871.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=97cdae62abf8c2a89fe1e07a1039482ab2a0a79b)

&#x200B;

On our next image, we can see that the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) has just crossed over the EMA (exponential moving average) with a divergence of .63. While this alone does not indicate a guaranteed reversal, paired with other indicators (such as the substantial divergence between the current stock price and the 50/100/200 moving averages above) the MACD can be a great indicator of reversals.

&#x200B;

[Autohome RSI](https://preview.redd.it/xqpdtkoeoa871.png?width=1316&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e5b06d22ab9607342dc16112a47de018bd292b3)

&#x200B;

As you can see here, the RSI recently slumped all the way down to a 16 twice, well below the consensus sub-30 RSI needed to classify a stock as oversold. This week we‚Äôve begun to see it slowly pull upwards, currently still sitting at just 34. An RSI this low in a market with sky-high valuations like we‚Äôve been seeing out of nearly every other company is a rare thing, with very few stocks creeping under 30 recently.

&#x200B;

#Bear Case

&#x200B;

No DD is ever complete without a bit of realism, so here are some potential downsides.

&#x200B;

1. The stock could simply keep falling. Nobody ever said the market was fully rational, and if Autohome slipped beneath the support at 60-65, we could see another drop in the near future.
2. Automotive sales and the steel/chip shortage could continue to impact automobile sales, especially NEVs. I don‚Äôt think this is particularly likely as we‚Äôve seen many governments and companies launch into action over the past 6 months to combat these shortages, and I think they‚Äôll get better rather than worse in the near future, but it‚Äôs always good to stay on top of things.
3. Returns on capital have decreased from 21% to 14% over the past 5 years. I believe this is primarily due to the emphasis Autohome has placed on R&D in the digital transformation that Quan Long spoke about and will indicate higher potential future growth, but it‚Äôs still worth taking into account.

&#x200B;

#Positions or fuck off

&#x200B;

20 shares (yes my portfolio isn‚Äôt that big I‚Äôm getting there don‚Äôt worry)

&#x200B;

Options: I currently do not own any options, though I plan on purchasing them this week. I‚Äôd prefer not to say which options I‚Äôll be purchasing on this DD (though I‚Äôll most likely buy ones with September expiration), due to the high bid-ask spread, low volume/open-interest, and low number of options available leaving these options fairly open for a potential P&D, something I‚Äôm not interested in."

# Who be the Jolly ZIM?

[ Check out the CEO's new whipüèéÔ∏è ](https://preview.redd.it/y3tkqug3na871.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=71d6fc653e958fedd7d2df0effa284ffcf14bbff)

Zim International Shipping Services is an Israeli based international shipping company that is headquartered in Norfolk, Virginia. As Pirates of the Zimmabean, it is a Top 20 global cargo carrier, and makes it possible for you to order a pocket pussy with Prime delivery. Leaving the politics aside, $ZIM was founded in 1945 right when the nation-state of Israel was beginning to form hundreds of thousands of immigrants began to travel there. These people were the first ‚Äòcargo‚Äô that ZIM ever transported. $ZIM ships throughout this decade further served as Israel‚Äôs only naval cargo system during the 1948 war with Palestine as military, freight, and ration supplies were all transported by them. They further profited in the 1960‚Äôs off reparations money given by West Germany which was then used to increase their fleet of cargo ships for international transport. This allowed for direct shipments to and from the United States which was net industrial exporter at the time. This initial tie with U.S. goods allowed ZIM to persist throughout the decades and become ye pirate chad that it is today. If you want to read the entire story of $ZIM and how they roamed as rulers of the sea like the Gigachad Pirates they are, refer to this [link](https://www.zim.com/about-zim/history).

As of the 21st century, $ZIM has spent the last two decades as a private firm paying debt off, surviving through the Great Recession and maintaining thin margins until the COVID pandemic. This past January they IPO‚Äôd as rival pirates roamed the land hunting for the latest booty (RTX 3080s), and settled at a share price of $15. **As of today, Zim is up about 300% due to extreme shipping bottlenecks and sheer demand of goods as Captain JPOW ignores what can only be described as Inflation Nation.** However, as you hornswogglers abandoned the value ship for riskier assets like $CUMMIES, $ZIM has proved itself to be the mightiest in the seas.

The Pirates of the Zimmabean have a vast network that rivals that of Jack Sparrow and his whores. With trade across nearly every shipping route, the world is $ZIMs oyster and the seas are its bitch... Due to increased good prices, they are primarily profiting off of Asia-United States trade routes and Southeast Asian intra-trades.  To date, they have approximately 99 vessels, 11 main trade networks, and hundreds of different sub-routes within these networks to major cities and capitals all around the globe.

# Jack Sparrow‚Äôs Inflation Fetish:

**As Jack Sparrow once said, ‚ÄúIf you were waiting for the opportune moment, that was it.‚Äù** The COVID pandemic essentially destroyed the supply chain as cargo ships were blocked from docking, unloading or even loading any goods within pre-pandemic timelines. As a result, many Californian and African ports are still seeing wait times of 2-3 weeks as backlogged ships continue to unload due to the rippling effect of the slowdown. With all of these goods occupied in containers and commodities rising exponentially in price due to said backlogs, there is a global shipping container shortage. Ships are needing to use every container available while the ports themselves have none to load new cargo back on. This has further led to increased shipping times and serves a negative feedback loop which I will go into more detail later in this post.

Aye, so you retards be wondering why this matters heh? Generally speaking, dry bulk ships and their cargo is measured in Deadweight TOnnage, or **DWT**, which measures the \*\*‚Äúweights of the cargo, fuel, fresh water, ballast water, provisions, passengers, and crew.‚Äù\*\*However, the main unit of measurement used for containerships is the **TEU, or Twenty-Foot Equivalent Unit**. This unit of measurement TEU refers directly to the length of containers themselves. These come in sizes approximately 20-feet long or **1 TEU**. Some containers also come in a standardized size of 40-feet long , which is about **2 TEU**s and is accounted for accordingly in the containership‚Äôs cargo. This is also used because although the weight of the shipments also affects various costs, to standardize contracts and general measurements, the mass of the cargo cannot always be measured exactly. Therefore the TEU value is a better way of measuring.

There are several different metrics to quantify these shortages:

1. The Shanghai Containerized Freight Index for TEU shows an astronomic rise from $1000 at the end of 2021 to **nearly $3700,** **a 370%** increase. As long as these shortages remain, which they appear to, this price will continue to increase. However, given the time it takes to increase supply and the number of ships available, it will be **2023 before shipping rates lower to average numbers.**

**Note that the TEU cannot be converted to mass because it is closer to a measure of space. We do not know the contents of any given container, and therefore cannot calculate mass (although in some circumstances you can infer the mass).**

1. Retail inventories are at their **lowest in nearly 25-30 years** based on shipping orderbook-to-fleet ratios. This metric measures the number of container, drybulk, and tanker orders relative to the number of pirate ships available to fulfill said orders. However, over the past decade since 2009, many shipping companies went bankrupt as container prices continued to lower while demand was met. This leaves $ZIM in a prime position to capture even more niche locations of the market. **Furthermore, the average duration to build new ships is approximately two years, indicating that until 2023, the supply of global cargo ships will remain the same.**
2. Due to commodity prices rising for both lumber and steel, the cost of the average LNG powered ship is being renegotiated constantly. To date, a large LNG powered container and drybulk ship costs double what it originally did, going from about $100M for a state of the art version to $200M currently. Arrrgh, that‚Äôs right mateys, inflation nation is here.
3. Based on Harpex data, these values are based on the cost of chartering the ships themselves.Currently, the cost to charter an 1,100 TEU ship is $18,750 USD per day, and the cost to charter an 8,500 TEU ship is $71,000 per day. This indicates that charter rates are **triple and quadruple the average rates over the past decade. Rates only peaked this high around 2007 near the previous commodities boom.**

# ZIM Be Looting The Seas:

[ Remember this fucker? He be the sealubber delivering your Amazon Prime dildos.   ](https://preview.redd.it/7un05tr8na871.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=444acd4b34b7ce82117c314d481f0d69b0ba21a3)

Containership rates continue to moon past expectations, with current ships being chartered / booked through 2022 and 2023, with most of the industry believing that these rates will hold through 2024. Unlike regular tankers (Obligatory RIP Tanker Gang), containerships are always transporting and have continuous shipments for **multiple years.** In terms of contracts, much of $ZIM‚Äôs 99 vessels are already booked **through 2023 and potentially 2024 if rates sustain themselves**.

In the overall global trade market, $ZIM is a smaller player, which surprisingly gives them an advantage. They have **20% of shipment capacity in long-term contracts and 80%  in short-term contracts.** The Chad CEO, Eli Glickman, has already clarified that most of their charter contracts are short-term because he **sees high rates persisting for a long time**. This means he can suck more money out of his clients in the short-term because they are desperate for ZIM‚Äôs services while ZIM has the upper ground. Additionally, long-term contracts generally come with a discount for the client since they ensure multi-year business for the shipping company. **ZIM** plays it smart by taking advantage of all the short term players who will pay a high premium for any charter service needed.

Furthermore, $ZIM also caters to lots of smaller trade routes including **intra-continental shipments**. As mentioned above, some of their best charters are between various Southeast Asian countries and African ports as well. **By focusing on both smaller and major trading routes, $ZIM is able to avoid many of the cascading backlog effects since there are less containerships operating in their waters.** Based on charter versus order data, many of ZIMs older vessels are also being retired and therefore scrapped, which may actually help reduce backlog and make their newer updated ships much more profitable.

**However, ZIM continues to expand as well**. It is now one of the **biggest importers between Asia and the US East Coast with direct shipments to NYC and Savannah.** They have also begun to send smaller containerships on routes between Taiwan and Oakland for Pacific shipments, **which helps avoid the many, many backlogs other shipment companies are facing in L.A. and San Francisco.** (I will discuss this next).

# Coastal Mutiny:

[ ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶. Captain? I don‚Äôt think your wife is going to get those limited edition Pickle Rick butt plugs in time.‚Äù  ](https://preview.redd.it/vx96xx6ana871.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0ccd8bb3d272f57d8860f989bd7a80af8bc9a28)

‚ÄúYarr, these swashbuckling whores be cock blocking the ports these days. The ol‚Äô corona shit itself on the docks and me pirate ships have no place to land and recuperate.‚Äù \~ Blackbeard

Ever since good old Captain Corona set sail on our sorry asses, ports at nearly every major trading route have been cock blocked. If you thought the Suez Canal blockage was large, its volume was tinier than your dicks compared to Chinese ports like the Yantian. **On average, they have a volume of 250K TEUs but within the past 2 months, this has nearly halved and has not risen back.** In Los Angeles, massive port jams and a lack of container supply to onboard more shipments have been fueled by labour shortages. The reopening has started, but the ports are still fucked.

In a statement from their competitor‚Äôs parent operator:

*‚ÄúIn 2021 carriers have missed (slide) a total of* ***121 sailings*** *into the \[US\] West Coast and 21 into the East Coast. As demand remains at an all-time high and backlogs in Asia continue to expand, the most common question remains why? The answer is directly tied to congestion levels across the entire network. One well documented and most clearly visible factor are* ***the port delays which on average stands anywhere between 1-3 weeks across the West Coast.*** *With each vessel making multiple stops, this naturally prevents them from being able to return to Asia to meet their next rotational departure. The outcome is an increase in what is described as a slide sailing. This occurs when all vessels on a string are in principle late due to the many delays, and as a measure to resolve the situation,* ***one or more planned sailings will have to be removed to realign the schedules.*** *‚Äú*

Ports and vessels continue to face COVID outbreaks due to the nature of their international trips, forcing temporary stops, quarantines, and ultimately delays in the overall market. However, what this does accomplish is more long-term shipping rates at high levels due to low inventory yet high demand and purchases. **Competitors like Maersk Shipping** are operating on 20% reduced capacity while **$ZIM continues to increase the number of routes and vessels being employed due to their mixed small and large route shipping strategy, helping them bang bardy wenches and gain massive booty.**

# Massive Booty Growth:

**Alrighty MATEYS, it is time to do the annual counting of the booty. The Pirates of the Zimmabean have banged mums, shipped goods, and looted tendies throughout the year for financial success that Jack Sparrow himself would nut for.**

**In the first quarter, $ZIM beat predicted EPS by 25% for a total of $5.13 relative to $4.09 predicted.** They also beat revenue with a posting of nearly $1.7B. For the entirety of 2021, the forecasted EBITDA has also doubled since previous targets, to approximately **$3.3B relative to $ZIM‚Äôs own guidance of approximately $2.5B, indicating a 32% increase**.

Borrowing graphs from another post,

[ Compared to every other shipping company, $ZIM has the largest EPS.  Furthermore, $DAC, which used to hold many ZIM shares, has slowly freed  them.   ](https://preview.redd.it/c4kawbadna871.png?width=659&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d8d5b935a1ea6c191aef723bf57adbee553416d)

[ At the same time, $ZIM also has the lower P\/E ratio despite massive predicted EPS beats upwards of 30&#37;.   ](https://preview.redd.it/16zczdadna871.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=f91545f85941091a55f362fd1b2a7526010233af)

Looking at $ZIM‚Äôs debt and leverage ratios, its competitors generally have about 3-5x debt-to-equity ratios after needing to raise capital and pay off business costs as a result of low investments in shipping. ZIM on the other hand stuck its golden crow up every crevice of the industry and maintains a **1.2 debt-to-equity ratio**, **a 66% decrease from 2 years ago**. In one year they payed off nearly **2 years of debt and continue to pay it off using the funds raised from this years growth.** It is important to note that this ratio is also lower than what most companies of similar size have. $ZIM also repaid $75M in bonds back to $DAC in April, which will also be beneficiary towards Q2 earnings.

ZIM‚Äôs market cap is around **$5B while they have nearly $881 million in Free Cash Flow.** This is a ratio of about 5.67 which is quite good for most companies, and especially good for the shipping industry. Given current rate prices, it would not be surprising that this ratio goes down to about 3.

Further comparing this value to ZIM‚Äôs forecasted EBITDA of **$3.3 Billion** by Citi Bank, and taxes of approximately 8.3%, the forecasted earnings for this year are approximately **$3.02B** which is nearly **60% of ZIM‚Äôs current market cap**. Using this value and the number of shares currently as approximately 114,508,115, **the final predicted EPS based on current guidance is about 26.37.**

# With a potential EPS of 26.37, about 30-50% percent is being distributed as dividend, indicating a lower dividend of $7.91 per share and an average of $10.5 per share which is 24.5% yield. This is unheard of in terms of dividend and may attract Old Man Boomer as well.

**Note: ZIM has already paid a $2 special dividend this year and plans to do so again in September.**

# Assuming an average P/E of 3 based on current values, ZIM could be worth up to $79 by the end of the year, or about 83.7% upside. However, I believe that factoring in conservative estimates and it‚Äôs already 300% growth this year, $ZIM has a fair value around $60, which is still a 39% upside.

# The Microsoft of Shipping:

The Pirates of the Zimmabean learned the ways of electric dildos and cancer causing cellular waves and have utilized this \~cutting edge\~ technology to maximize the customer experience. Most companies be using old-fangled 1950‚Äôs technology and wooden sticks for sexy times late at night. ZIM is beyond that. On their digitization page, \[ZIM Digitals\]([https://www.zim.com/services/digital-services](https://www.zim.com/services/digital-services)), it advertises their custom software **myZim** to easily manage shipments, view various shipping rates, and make calculations about costs and deliveries. There are also more complex features such as tariff and toll charges as well as shipment tracking and **container tracking**. One thing that makes them quite different is a dashboard to see the pollutant impact of a client's shipment based on routes and the vessel size as well as shipment weight.

One more controversial aspect that I saw is their **collaboration with $BABA aka Alibaba**, **Sparx Logistics, and Wave**, to implement **blockchain technology** for electronic billing services. From the **TImes Of Israel article**, *‚ÄúWave‚Äôs application functions through a ‚Äúsecure decentralized network,‚Äù the company said, and is free for shippers, importers and traders, requiring no IT or operational changes. The application makes sure that the digitized document remains true to the original throughout the shipment, detecting forgeries if they arise.""*

**All of these changes show me that ZIM is dedicated to changing its outlook and company for the better to adapt to new trends and technologies that will take them one step further past the traditional shipping companies.**

# Analyst ANALysis:

As always, it is important to consider the analyst side of the price since those groups dictate the market. **Jeffries rates ZIM as a strong buy with an average price target of $53 and an upper target of $60.** The lower target is $40 but this most likely will change for the better after Q2 earnings.

**Zacks Investment Research** upgraded shares of ZIM Integrated Shipping Services from a ""hold"" rating to a ""strong-buy"" rating and set a $43.00 price target on the stock.

However, \*\*many analysts are still at the lower end and have an average rating of about $39.\*\*This is most likely a conservative estimate and ZIM is most likely undervalued based on the current financial stats.

# TL;DR / Conclusion:

**Based on the financial analysis and current trends, ZIM is a longer term play with earnings catalysts upcoming for August 18th. Therefore August calls and LEAPS are ideal, as well shares to capitalize on the MASSIVE dividend. However, this is not financial advice.**

# ZIM is a continuously growing, strategic shipping company, with leadership that continues to improve their services. Despite having much larger competitors, its fundamentals amidst current rates show that it is still undervalued. I believe it can reach $60 and my positions are contracts of Aug 50C and shares. I be off now, enjoy ye tendies, arghhhhh and remember, this is not financial advice.

Bought 220 shares @ $43,79, being europoor boomer. Have had success with companies that are starting to pay good dividends, boomers react surprisingly last minute to juicy dividends that were known to be happening ages ago.

The IPO lockdown ending in a bit over month is worrying, but left some powder for a potential 2nd purchase."

2021-06-29 23:10:23,wallstreetbets,"It has just been a major resistance area. Lots of sell pressure. Combination of profit taking from people who have been in it a while, algos, etc. Each time it hits that area, more orders are filled and there will be less and less resistance. That plus irregular buying volume (say, for instance, from people reading a great DD) and it wouldnt be surprising to see a big breakout from that area."
2021-06-29 23:13:34,wallstreetbets,"Zugz basically answers it below but $50 is a huge resistance line and the consequent runup made it appear as overbought. I suspect it was mainly algos or some small institution dumping their positions until the next run up. In my opinion, this is perfect because looking at the overall chart, after a large fall, ZIM tends to rise up just as quick"

2021-06-29 21:37:57,wallstreetbets,"I completely understand your point of view. From my perspective, $ZIM isn‚Äôt necessarily tied to what Israel is doing nor helping them profit. It‚Äôs completely international anyways and many companies use things directly from China, so it would mean boycotting most big companies if we tied the politics to the company every time."
2021-06-30 01:48:55,wallstreetbets,"This is retarded. Israel is the top start up company country in the world, there is more creative shit coming from there than any country. What does citizens and businessmen and companies have to do with the political motivations of a country, which had a corrupt president. Basically one thing has nothing to do with each other."
2021-06-30 06:25:33,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I have been in ZIM for a while and do not believe it will crack over $50, but buying puts right now would be pretty silly.  Wait until mid-July so you can capitalize on when their lock-up period expires and insiders take their profits."

I felt cheated and spammed as so did soo many on stock twits and reddit at the time...
I'm basically a bag holder now of a stock that is $4.xx per share and I need it to be $37.xx to even breakout of my losses. 

Hence, I don't like to invest in shipping company tickers and I would suggest everyone to do their own DD and examine past performance charts before jumping impulsively in a shipping stock.

That is solely my opinion and not a financial advice."

Doesn‚Äôt mean this guys bull case is wrong, and the last two times I saw ZIM mentioned here it came with some actual solid DD and has grown multiple times, it just got ignored then and people are acting like this is a P&D when it is actually a reasonable swing trade if you play the technicals right (which, if you read some of the comments, the OP admits is probably the best strategy)."

  I'm not in in a big way, but hoping to grow my tiny little $1000 TDA account, and the reason I GOT in on CLOV is because I've been lurking here for a couple months, and didn't want to miss another opportunity for big gains.

  I've got a few shares, and the aforementioned 14C for 7/2.  Just ONE.  If I was more computer savvy, I'd post a screenshot of my positions, but like I said - TOTAL value of my TDA account is right at a grand, so not really worth the time.

I'm definitely not an 'inflitrator' or a bot.  Just someone who's trying to figure all this stuff out & gambling in a different way than I'm used to.  It's a LOT easier to put 100 bucks into a slot and hit the button a few times hoping to get lucky, but seeing some of the gains people posted here...  Wow!

&#x200B;

Thanks to all who replied.  I'm basically of the opinion now - ""Fuck Motley Fool"".  I'll take my gambling advice from WSB!!"
2021-06-30 01:34:16,wallstreetbets,Citadel pump and dump. Og apes won't touch this with a ten foot pole.  Hope you get back some tendies. Wait for the daybtrader pops
2021-06-29 21:53:31,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm buying in at $1
2021-06-30 00:35:05,wallstreetbets,I hope it goes to zero because you guys are ducking cringe with this ape shit. Give WSB back. Out of here with your hostile takeover. Nobody likes you.  It was fun for a few weeks with GME. It‚Äôs long past played out now
2021-06-29 22:29:59,wallstreetbets,I wouldn‚Äôt bet on this stock if I liked money.
2021-06-29 22:37:43,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, don‚Äôt buy it and buy amc/GME or NIO"
2021-06-29 22:26:10,wallstreetbets,Love it.  Any publicity is good publicity.  Easy for people who do their own DD to see past that nonsense.
2021-06-30 17:30:45,wallstreetbets,Lol CLOV. Stock has been a distraction from the jump. AMC & GME only way.
2021-06-29 20:05:51,wallstreetbets,I you want to really know about the stock then don't listen to Motley Fool. There is DD all over the internet.

Every single meme stock that has had a squeeze has put that disclaimer (or similar) in their prospectus. That's them just covering their asses.

2021-06-29 23:49:10,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs just a warning that if you go and buy at $50 or $80 or whatever during the squeeze that when it‚Äôs over you might be looking at some hefty losses. Gonna be a hot potato during the actual squeeze so they just have to warn your ass.
2021-06-30 00:50:15,wallstreetbets,Not everything is a short squeeze.

2021-06-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SPCE is on track to the moon I am writing this post to clarify some purposes of this great company/stock. Many think it is just manufacturing spaceships to travel to the space. No, this is not the only service for this company. I purchased 2000 shares and I wouldn‚Äôt have purchased them for just this purpose.

Virgin Galactic is designing the aircraft for a range of operational scenarios, including service for passengers on long-distance commercial aviation routes. The aircraft would take off and land like any other passenger aircraft and be expected to integrate into existing airport infrastructure and international airspace around the world.

This follows the successful completion of its Mission Concept Review (MCR) program milestone and authorisation from the Federal Aviation Administration‚Äôs (FAA) Center for Emerging Concepts and Innovation to work with Virgin Galactic to outline a certification framework. This marks an exciting step forward in Virgin Galactic‚Äôs development of a new generation of high speed aircraft. 

The projected speed of Virgin Galactic‚Äôs business jet is 2,300 mph which which means that non-stop flight from US to Australia can take only 3-4 hours (instead of the current 16-19 hours). This may not be important to regular guys like us, but it will be extremely important for business men, athletes and politicians whose time is worth millions of dollars; these tickets will be purchased at premium prices

Have a better vision, in order to have a proper investment. SPCE will be soon 3 digits"

Solid buy at sub $10, sure. 

But this ain't going to $20+ anytime soon. WISH sell shit, their metrics are shit, and EU are on their ass for facilitating counterfeit and unsafe goods. 

They also manipulated their metrics to get the IPO valuation. 

This ain't going moon. This going basement. 

Don't be holding your bags."

2021-06-29 21:03:19,wallstreetbets,"75% increase of revenue, huge exposure via retail investors, 1.6 billion on hand, support of Chinese markets.

Right."
2021-06-30 00:15:28,wallstreetbets,Nope. I‚Äôm also heavily invested in GME & I‚Äôve never stepped foot in the place but it‚Äôs made me a pretty penny. What‚Äôs your point??
2021-06-29 21:04:44,wallstreetbets,"$300 million loss in operating cash per quarter, declining sales as the pandemic ends....that 1.6 billion won't last long.   WISH is not profitable and probably won't ever be....

Also the reason their prices are so low is they sell counterfeit goods.  Lawsuits coming...."
2021-06-30 00:18:04,wallstreetbets,"GME has nostalgia behind it and there was a big push to do a big F.U. to Wall Street firms who‚Äôve shorted it. 

WISH has neither. It‚Äôll never reach higher than it was when it first went public. No one likes WISH and no one is even bothering to short WISH."
2021-06-29 21:07:07,wallstreetbets,Who doesn't sell counterfeits online? Even target online and Walmart incorporated 3rd party sellers
2021-06-30 01:13:58,wallstreetbets,Is there not a lawsuit for misrepresentation of stock value?
2021-06-29 21:10:49,wallstreetbets,"Walmart, etc. has an obligation to remove counterfeit sellers when discovered and therefore at least has plausible deniability.  WISH does not have this, because its entire business model turns on counterfeit sellers."
2021-06-29 21:12:39,wallstreetbets,"WISH also fines and withholds payment from the sellers caught pumping fake reviews, so you are simply misinformed. The sketchy items I saw are also on Amazon, same thing."
2021-06-29 21:15:36,wallstreetbets,Fake reviews.  Not fake products.  Wish could not stay in business without fake products.
2021-06-29 21:16:19,wallstreetbets,"Right, because the products are the same shit as on Amazon but priced cheaper"
2021-06-29 22:38:54,wallstreetbets,Arguing with a WISH bagholder is like arguing with a Trump supporter.  Everyone knows WISH is garbage.  Just another WSB's pump and dump meme stock...
2021-06-29 21:17:00,wallstreetbets,"They're not the same shit, that's why they are so much cheaper.  If it's too good to be true it probably is.

A lot of them don't even function as advertised."
2021-06-29 21:18:27,wallstreetbets,"Dude the swords, rc cars, knives are literally the same garbage. The same low quality items. Identically bad.

Amazon has literally the same ones, I've bought them on Amazon and they are shit."
2021-06-29 21:20:37,wallstreetbets,"A $46 Android smartphone is definitely a counterfeit.  There's no other possibility.  Especially when you consider the costs of shipping everything from China.

There is an entire ring of counterfeit producers in China that this company simply must be allowing to sell on their platform.

Maybe not every single thing is counterfeit, but a lot of it is."
2021-06-29 21:22:27,wallstreetbets,Dude i spent 30 seconds on Amazon and found many under 50 bucks. Tell me more lol
2021-06-29 21:29:33,wallstreetbets,"Those are used phones from private sellers, most likely.   Not purportedly brand new 5"" phones.

Look, you don't need to believe me.  If you want to invest in this company go right ahead.  I have no stake in this either way.  Just trying to bring some clarity to all the pumpy bs around this stock so less people get hurt."
2021-06-29 21:31:40,wallstreetbets,"You're flat out wrong. Check out tracfone phones for sale including new.

2021-06-29 20:10:49,wallstreetbets,"I was in MU for like 6 months a couple of years ago.  Seemed they always dropped after earnings regardless of numbers and the IV crush was bad even if you got a small pop.  But it could be different this time.  I wish you luck, retard."
2021-06-29 20:16:08,wallstreetbets,"The play was a week ago when it was 75.  If blowout earnings and expectations, at most this will go to 96.  This is super resistance level since the dot com bubble back in 2000."
2021-06-29 23:12:58,wallstreetbets,"One thing to be cautious about with MU is whether they will be revising forward CapEx.  

Be aware of this as with MU there is a chance that they will beat earnings estimates but look ‚Äòbad‚Äô for increasing future investment (which is from a long term perspective bullish).

2021-06-29 20:17:58,wallstreetbets,"It's not wrong, I said this was years ago and it could be different now.

You can laugh at me, I deserve it, but also I seek advice if you can offer it.. wtf should I do here to minimize my losses?

I actually didn't realize I was trading on a margin account.. it was just a normal investing acct before I applied to trade options.

I put in 2k cad and when I made the order for 20 contracts it quoted me roughly 1k CAD.. I was fine with possibly losing 1k as a learning experience.

I'm now seeing this is a potentially much bigger mistake üòÇ I still don't fully understand what happened.. I made an order that cost more than the amount of cash I had in my margin account? Is that it?

How much $ could I lose here... Ruh roh.

2021-06-29 20:50:50,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not sure how people confused you, but once a call contract is ITM (in the money) it can be exercised. So say he bought $19.50 Calls for a 7/2 strike (he paid a premium of $.79 per contract) his break even would then be a share price of $20.29. If the stock hits $19.50 tomorrow, he could technically exercise the option and buy however many contracts multiplied by 100 shares at a price of $19.50 per share. Typically most won‚Äôt exercise and just take the profit, I believe the broker would handle and sell everything at that time. Hope that makes sense"

2021-06-30 06:02:16,wallstreetbets,"If the price per share of SOFI is lower than $21.5 by this friday after market close you'll lose everything you put into these calls. 

If the price is above that but below your break even price ($21.5 + whatever amount of premium you paid per share) you'll still lose some money, quite a lot if very close to $21.5.

This thing needs to fly past the $21.5 strike price for you not to lose money on this trade in 3 days, and if it doesn't even make it to $21.5 you'll lose it all (your calls will expire worthless).

Also, very important, every day that passes theta will eat away at the premium you can sell them for faster and faster, and you might see that their value still goes down even if the price of the stock slowly moves up to the strike price, so decide quickly if you want to bail or bite the bullet and hold them until they potentially expire worthless."
2021-06-30 01:30:16,wallstreetbets,"It looks to me like you  paid $1.15 US each for 20 contracts. That's $2,300 US or a bit over $2,800 CAD.   It's calls, so of course you can lose all of it unless you sell to cut your losses."
2021-06-29 20:51:12,wallstreetbets,He would lose his entire investment
2021-06-30 02:50:28,wallstreetbets,Then he either sells the contracts probably for 1 dollar each or worthless.  It makes no sense to exercise a contract to buy the shares at 19.5 when you can buy them at 17.5
2021-06-29 20:00:52,wallstreetbets,and his total loss would be capped at around whatever 100 x 17.50 subtracted by his initial investment?
2021-06-29 20:05:57,wallstreetbets,"No the contract expires worthless.

The price of the option will drop towards 0 as expiration approaches if out-of-the-money.

2021-06-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Not much but its a stock I like - NYMT NYMT - New York Mortgage Trust - a stock I like!

It's a very basic stock. I had my eye on it right after the crash and it dropped from about $6.xx to $2.xx, I've bought and sold it a few times but as of now I'm just going to start putting a lot of cash into it on a regular basis ($250 a paycheck or so), and here's why:

The stock pays quarterly dividends - pre-crash it was 0.20 a share, now they are doing about .1 a share, which works out to about 8-12% annual return on money depending on your purchase price.  I have every belief that they will get back up to that 0.20 per share quarerly dividend over time, which if you were to get it at/below $5 is a 16%+ annual return on investment.  

I know this isn't the 10,000% returns that people tend to get around here, but a stock selling below its market value that offers a consistent ROI is the type of thing I get excited about.  I know its nothing big but if I can get about $2,000 into the stock over the next year that nets me about a $300-400 dividend stream a year, which is pretty good for someone like me!

2021-06-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"How RIG is the Bubba Gump Shrimp CO [RIG] I will get into how RIG is gonna be Bubba Gump Shrimp, but first lets set the stage.

**What is RIG?**

In a nutshell rig is an oil driller for hire in the deep ocean, the Finra description literally says ""ultra-deep-ocean"" so you know these guys fuck. In a nutshell some big oil company comes along wanting deep ocean oil, and they pay these dudes to set up an offshore rig and get it for them, and they keep a chunk of the change.

&#x200B;

**What have they got going for them?**

They have two things working for them, first off, oil prices are on the rise, which means that they are going to see a bump in their profit margins, and lets take a look at who is going to be able to compete with them for a piece of that growing pie? Nobody. That right, every other company that does what RIG does went belly up during the pandemic and now they are the only game in town. Do you remember that scene in Forest Gump where he touches Jenny's boobs and then nuts in his pants? Well I am not talking about that one, I am talking about the scene where him and Lt Dan go shrimping, but get caught in a hurricane and every boat but them gets wrecked, and now they are the only shrimping boat in Louisiana and make a genuine retard a retarded amount of tendies? RIG is Bubba Gump Shrimp.

**Who else is buying?**

Let's take a look at who else is getting into RIG right now.

Insider Buying

The Execs are buying this thing up like Wall Street buys coke and like WSB buys FDs, and shares are still sitting at prices nearly identical to what the insiders got a hold of them at. Said it before, I will say it again. There are tons of reasons to sell, only one reason to buy.

&#x200B;

**Technical**

TBH, I don't fuck with that much with technicals. If it looks good it looks good, and I will throw in a support now and then, or a wedge, but the 2yr chart speaks for itself. Solid bottom with a strong stable climb that has been tested, then a new floor around the $3.50 - $4 mark loaded with insider buys. The farm must be close, because I smell some bulls.

&#x200B;

**Price Targets**

EOY looking for $8 which places it just shy of 5BN MKT cap, and could see this sucker easily hitting mid $20 EO22.

How to play it? Honestly, the shares are so cheap, if you go shares or leaps its not really going to make that much of a difference in total capital, so if you like the feeling of gambling, load up on some ITM Jan calls, and some top of the chain Jan '23s. For me, I am going to Theta gang into these, just selling loads of puts and hoping for dips to get assigned on.

**Positions**

I will continue to update this position since I am in the process of entering if anyone wants to follow the trade. The plan for now is to keep selling the below spread or puts every two weeks to get some theta gang tendies while also getting high number of assignment opportunities at good prices. I have much larger position in a few plays I am not done with, but plan to triple the number of puts in the next month or so.

(Original Position) Short x6 3.5P 7/9Short x6 4P 7/9Short x6 4.5P 7/9

**Update 7/1**  
Short: 6x 7/9 4.5P, 14x 7/16 4.5P, 6x 7/23 4.5pLong: 101 Shares @ 4.70, 1 Jan '22 4.5C (all bought with put premium)"
2021-06-29 23:14:58,wallstreetbets,"Bro, *what are you doing with those puts*. I'm a huge advocate of theta tendies, but the $3.5 puts have literally a penny of premium. That doesn't even cover commission at most brokers. The $4's aren't much better at $0.06. Please tell me you sold them a while ago for much higher premiums.

Given the IV Rank on this and the possible insane upside, LEAPs are the play. Hell, even shares are great since they have no theta burn. I'm in on this bitch too https://i.imgur.com/DcvOnSE.png might even add more shares if there's a dip."
2021-06-30 00:01:38,wallstreetbets,"So part of the reason it maybe hasnt moved is because the reason oil jumped the past year or so is because after the mid 2010s when the price crash everybody in the game was super overleveraged trying to cash in on newly develooed north american sources, bakken fields, Permian basin, etc. That produced a glut of oil, crashing the price, nobody could pay back their loans, cash flow was super in the red, a lot of companies folded. 

The companies that survived this have been really wary of developing new sources, and they might be just content to lay back, watch the price go up and let the money roll in on what sources they already have developed. Which means RIG might not join the party for a while."
2021-06-30 13:17:09,wallstreetbets,"Long the shares. I wake up every morning panicking that I don't own nearly enough of this thing and buy a few hundred more each day. It moves around a good bit, so be patient on your limit orders, you'll get it.

2021-06-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Tech Analysis of PSFE &#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/7p16s5n3w9871.png?width=1783&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e340fe9005c8849df40b07970e1c671b06d4d13)

Hi Everyone

Here's a Tech Analysis of PSFE.  Disclaimer: I went long yesterday at 12.20.

On the daily chart, PSFE went into over sold territory on may 13, it looks like it bottomed out at 10 dollars.  That's the first trigger I was looking for to keep an eye on the stock.  It was just rejected on the RED MA, but it needs to clear the blue which is at 13.5 for the real party to start.

&#x200B;

[5 min chart](https://preview.redd.it/icrtal6ow9871.png?width=1783&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6f569c25adaeb9a11289439730f3ad097a86bf9)

On the 5 min chart, it has cleared the pink and the purple MAs which tell me momentum has shifted to the up side which is what triggered my entry.  Currently, based on the elliot wave principle we are in corrective WAVE 2, which is forming up to be a side ways ABCDE wave.  A close above the 13 dollar price would put us into wave 3 which matches with the daily chart needing to close above 13.5.  For those who are into the elliot wave principle wave 3 tends to be the largest wave.

TL:DR PSFE has been dropping for 6 months now, finally entering oversold territory.  Its best to go long here and hold till it reaches over bought territory then take profit."

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-19/wind-solar-are-cheapest-power-source-in-most-places-bnef-says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-19/wind-solar-are-cheapest-power-source-in-most-places-bnef-says)

Fossil fuel shipping accounts for  70% of all of the cargo shipping industries business.  In 5 years solar and wind will not just be cheaper than fossil fuels (which they already are) at scale they will be cheaper to operate.  Market forces will lead to around 70-80% of all power being generate using renewables.  


"" That‚Äôs the analysis of BloombergNEF, which **predicts a tipping point in five years when it will be more expensive to operate an existing coal or natural gas power plant than to build new solar or wind farms**. ""

Eventually this will saturate the market at around 70-80% renewables source of power.

"" because the technology no longer reduces generation costs compared with running the existing thermal generation fleet. ""

This will have massive impact on the shipping industry, when would shorting shipping company stock become viable?

**I want to have a discussion in the comments about a few points:**

Which shipping companies are most reliant on fossil fuels for their business? 

 How far out would a position need to be taken on this. 

 Is taking positions like this a viable way to punish companies with bad environmental track records?

It could be a fairly complex and expensive pivot especially as rail infrastructure is hard to change or expand. Depending on geography they may not even have much options for other large clients

Rail frieght in the uk is undergoing a revival though thanks in part to fuel prices, a denser nation and a huge change to ecommerce. It also helps that theres a rail connection to the rest of europe that is not affected by the weather in the way sea crossings are and without the hassle of ferries, brexit lorry queue worries and covid tests.

If its on a train you might aswell leave it on it till it gets near you. A growth of multi modal industrial and warehousing estates help with this too (basically a normal industrial estate but with trains and lorries)

Its taken decades for this switch and it mainly benefits from uncertain headwinds and could of easily gone another way"

2021-06-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$SOFI - Unbiased Technical Analysis - Massive Setup Forming Saw this one catch everyone's eye recently so I figured I would provide a roadmap as always:

[$SOFI 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/72wvue3dn9871.png?width=2219&format=png&auto=webp&s=61120e23694b0cb15398484ee2e7464160bb9277)

This is a **Symmetrical Triangle** that has been forming since January **7**th. It has a **bullish** bias since it is coming from upside.

It breaks out above **24.10** tomorrow, sloping down each day by about **0.10.** The price targets for said breakout would be **30.00 --> 35.00.** There is slight resistance just above at **24.96** I want to be mindful of - but it will become nice support once we clear it.

Normally I would talk about the bearish scenario for a setup like this - but I don't like this one for downside.

There's a bunch of key levels to look at inside if you are looking to accumulate shares early. Support is **17.59, 15.59,** and the low end of the triangle at **14.80.** Resistance is at **21.02, 22.02** and the top of the triangle at **24.10.**

Note the up move today was gap filling from the one left on **6/24**. We are still rangebound - and as such taking long options positions is dangerous (especially short-term). Interesting uptick in volume recently - perhaps due to WSB influence, or end of quarter rebalancing. Since we've sort of gone flat off of it - there isn't too much practical information to glean.

August Calls are very liquid and likely what I will be getting into if we break out before July OpEx.

Yes, I know there are tons of fundamental factors you guys are looking at - but it's already been posted 5000 times so it's unnecessary for me to reiterate it. I find that stocks with good fundamental stories tend to break to the upside far more often - so I consider those headwinds a plus for the chart.

\---

**Edit:** Forgot to include timeframe\~

The setup would play out probably over a couple weeks AFTER it breaks out\~  


Technically, there is room for the stock to chop in this setup until December, though I doubt it waits that long\~

2021-06-30 12:51:19,wallstreetbets,"I'm just trying to give people bagholding stocks on random (usually shitty) DD some actual unbiased analysis to follow.

I don't understand how this is ""biased"" - I provided where the setup breaks up, and where it breaks down. That's all I do in any post. I don't understand how I'm being called out when there are people who don't even do technical analysis every day on the front page - they just pull random indicators that fit what they want to happen.

It's unbiased because I don't yet have a position - I provided triggers for when I would enter a position. I literally said the stock DOESN'T look good short-term.

I understand to the layman it might look like what you are saying - but there definitely is setups for a most of the tickers being thrown around here.

What would you suggest I do? I do the most popular ones because that's what is useful to the most people here. If you check my post history - almost all have been spot on - I don't post about it unless there actually IS a good setup - unlike most people on here.

And lastly - I don't just post the ""most popular tickers"" - like I said, ONLY when there is a nice setup - just recently I posted VIAC/BIDU/JD before ANYONE was talking about it, as well as ZM, AMD, TSLA, etc."

My criteria varies from stock to stock, but it'll all amounts to essentially if ""I think the price is too low"" for monthlies, and I'm willing to bet on it, ill make the play.

I rarely ever buy puts. I usually have 1 or 2 stocks that I'm very attentive to at a time and they are ones I know well and like alot."

2021-06-29 23:43:04,wallstreetbets,Starlink is good rly I think I remember Musk said he made it when he got annoyed he couldnt check his email on a plane ride.
2021-06-29 23:28:27,wallstreetbets,I think they have an internet infrastructure that countries can't control. Unless you have a space laser to knock out each satellite.  It could be internet freedom unless the Musk becomes Lex Luthor.
2021-06-30 07:15:23,wallstreetbets,Didnt Musk team up with the Space Force? Might have already considered that and are preemptively protecting the sats

2021-06-30 08:25:03,wallstreetbets,Time to sell when the uber driver talks about it
2021-06-30 11:04:42,wallstreetbets,"I'd argue that most people requiring or wanting constant, good connection to the internet can easily have both with starlink and a wireless provider. Most already have a decent enough wireless provider to have internet on the go minus some dead zones that's affordable. All that is lacking is a good, reliable, and affordable home connection for a majority outside urban areas. That's my experience at least living in the boonies."
2021-06-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Vizio DD - A less risky ROKU but at a steal of a price $VZIO is a mature device company. They currently sell smart TV's, soundbars, etc. That's fine and dandy, but in their recent IPO, 10K, and 8K they have made many mentions of their shift into the a much more lucrative space.

Vizio introduced Platform+, which includes a smart TV operating system called SmartCast and a data analytics service called Inscape. Similar to ROKU this allows individuals to stream whatever content they like on their TV. Again, the main difference is that ROKU is selling a $25 box vs. VZIO selling a $200 TV. That may sound scary but let's look at their Q1 highlights:

**Q12021 Highlights:**  
 ‚Ä¢*Net revenue increased 52% year over year to $505.7 million*

*‚Ä¢Platform+ net revenue increased 120% year over year to $52.2 million*

 *‚Ä¢Adjusted EBITDA increased 218% year over year to $40.4 million*   
   
*‚Ä¢SmartCast Active Accounts grew 57% year over year to 13.4 million*

*‚Ä¢SmartCast Hours grew 70% year over year to 3.6 billion*

*‚Ä¢Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) increased 76% year over year to $14.52*

  


Okay, so good financially and operationally - but are their TV sales growing?  
 

*Ranked #2 best-selling TV brand in the US during Q1 2021*

*Ranked #1 best-selling Sound Bar in the US during Q1 2021*  


As millennials and cheap old fucks continue to cut the cord, the $70 billion TV ad market will bleed into the streaming platforms that everyone is using.   


Yes, they are late to the game. But because Vizio is a name/brand we've all heard of and has massive market penetration already, if/when they can figure out their SmartCast monetization the associated revenue becomes a flip of the switch for them. $VZIO is targeting huge monetization opportunities in areas such as ad-supported video on demand, home screen advertising, and partner marketing.   


BY THE WAY:  Vizio currently has a partnership with Verizon. This partnership is a further advance towards enabling new cross-platform and CTV advertising solutions, with the help of Inscape's smart TV data.

As a cap off, take a look at this quick comparison. IMO either ROKU is incredibly overpriced or VZIO has a long way to run.

2021-06-30 14:33:27,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately, Vizio is failing hard on their smartcast platform. They push down firmware updates to their TVs which often breaks things. 

DISC: I have a Vizio TV with SmartCast 

I finally got fed up with the issues, and I bought a ROKU and unplugged the TV from the network. Everything is working fine, no more issues.

If they can't fix this, and their customer service around that (compare to ROKU's excellent customer service - Vizio's is trash), then they're just selling TVs and soundbars. I suggest perusing /r/VIZIO_Official and /r/VizioTV and check out the issues people have. You would think that VIZIO would want to make sure their official subreddit provided SOME kind, ANY response to buyers' questions and problems. It's a very bad look."
2021-06-30 16:27:21,wallstreetbets,Roku so go to $1000 Visio is nothing like Roku bruh
2021-06-29 20:42:00,wallstreetbets,"It's a momentum play - look at the market cap compared to ROKU - there's so much room to grow.

People conflate stock price with total enterprise value. Despite the price run up 30% the market cap is WELL below ROKU who I believe is an accurate comparison given the other financial stats. 

If this stock split 4/1 rn, behavioral economics suggests people would buy it because it's ""cheap"""
2021-06-30 00:09:34,wallstreetbets,Roku and Visio are not in the same market.
2021-06-30 10:13:29,wallstreetbets,Which markets do they each play in?
2021-06-30 10:48:16,wallstreetbets,"Visio makes TVs. 

Roku is the leading streaming device. They have an App Store. They managed to get all major providers to get on the platform even with the new direction: They‚Äôre in the ad business now and they don‚Äôt pay for content."
2021-06-30 10:51:53,wallstreetbets,"I guess that's the point I'm trying to make - maybe I didn't do a good job.  


Visio is attempting to break into the streaming market with SmartCast and Platform+  


If you believe that they can leverage these new platforms (that have had impressive growth) then they will start to become more like ROKU."
2021-06-30 11:11:37,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it‚Äôs definitely a lucrative market. 

Samsun, LG and others also allows apps to be loaded on their platform. Even cable boxes have Netflix and such preloaded. 

On the OTT device side, we already have Amazon, Apple, Google (Chromecast), etc. It‚Äôs easy to buy $100 device and plug it into your TV than buy a whole new TV. 

Roku managed to go horizontal and the last big one they got on was HBOMax. It‚Äôs difficult to dislodge them now because of: user base + streaming providers. Customers want just one device. Fewer remotes. 

Disclaimer: I don‚Äôt have any position with Roku."

2021-06-29 21:13:07,wallstreetbets,"Mini DD. 

RKT is making a bit of a killing by buying back loans of people who opted to skip payments with new covid rules. 

They look to see which loans are likely go back to current (low loan to value and good credit) but the skipped payments triggers a rule that lets the servicer rebuy at par (these loans trade well above par). They then cure the loans, repackage them into MPTs and sell them well above par back to the buy side and Fed. The Fed buys 40Billion a month and that helps ensure an well above par bid.

RKT and WFC have been super agressive with this but RKT is the pure play. Many of these loans are still curing on RKT's balance sheet but once they cure they can be re-sold and the profits will go straight to the bottom line. Spring loaded high margin earnings just loaded up on the balance sheet waiting to be realized.

It is a free money clitch caused by the Covid rules and they are making huge profits."

> Day Cozcacuauhtli (Vulture, known as Cib in Maya) is governed by Itzpapalotl as its provider of tonalli (Shadow Soul) life energy. Cozcacuauhtli signifies long life, wisdom, good counsel and mental equilibrium. It is a good day to confront the discontinuities, disruptions, failures and deaths one suffers in life. Cozcacuauhtli is a day for tricking the Trickster.

> The thirteen day period (trecena) that starts with day 1-Cuetzpalin (Lizard) is ruled by Itzlacoliuhqui. **The 13 days of this trecena are governed by the meting out of irrational rewards and punishments. These are 13 days of confusion, a time when the noble and ignoble have equal chance to be raised up or thrown down.** The warrior must be like the lizard, who is not hurt from a high fall but, instead, immediately climbs back to its perch. These are good days to keep out of sight; bad days to attract attention.

Personally, I work in an industry that involves home improvement and we are busy *as fuck*. The *only* issue is a bit of a lack of labor and supply shortage. 

People are *absolutely* spending money, have money saved up, and are feeling good about it. 

Beyond this, when I go out to bars/restaurants, they‚Äôre packed. 

‚ÄúBut gas prices!‚Äù 

Gas prices were fucking higher than this over a decade ago when I just started driving. 3.15 is literally *cheap* from my perspective. I remember paying fucking +$4 sometimes. 

If $3.15 is supposed to be ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù *and* we‚Äôre supposed to be experiencing ‚Äú*so much inflation*‚Äù that just doesn‚Äôt add up to me.

Obviously not a financial expert, but idk. On the ground level the bear case seems fucking stupid. The economy is strong right now."

2021-06-30 01:32:54,wallstreetbets,"I had a little whiskey and I‚Äôm here to give you boys and girls a pep talk, some of you may need it; others, not so much. Have confidence in everything you do, but do not confuse confidence and arrogance. Do not act like you know what you‚Äôre doing, just think it. If you lose you look like a humble person who tried their best, which is essentially true. 

Keep your goals based in reality and keep most of them to yourself. If you go into something unsure of your ability you are already losing the battle. In the meantime, use your brain, actually use it. I do this with math. For years I would say ‚ÄúI suck at math‚Äù to myself, a relatively simple real-world math problem would come up and I would immediately defer to my calculator. Now I sit and actually try and solve it in my head, the more you do it, the better you get at it. Your brain has this default network do this for most things. You think of a problem, you deem the problem to require too much mental gymnastics, you ‚Äúchange the subject‚Äù in your own head. You don‚Äôt outwardly look like a fool, you created the problem in your head and then dismissed it without saying a word to anyone, no sweat. But the more often you do this, the more often it becomes harder to think in complex thought. 

This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúlife hack‚Äù, it‚Äôs a way to live. You‚Äôd be surprised what your capable of and the more you equip yourself mentally, the more inner confidence you can have. I‚Äôm constantly working on this myself and it‚Äôs certainly an uphill battle.

Investors weighed up fresh data indicating an easing in the speed of China's recovery, and lingering worries over a contagious strain of Covid-19.  
  
U.S. stock futures fell in step with European stocks.  
  
Asian equities finished mixed, with the Nikkei 225 index stalling, though finishing the first half of 2021 just under 5% higher, according to FactSet. China's CSI 300 index gained 0.6%, with around a 3.5% rise in the first half. An official gauge of China's factory activity slipped in June, dented by chip and power supply shortages, while nonmanufacturing growth also slowed amid rising Covid-19 cases.  
  
Worries over the highly contagious Delta strain of Covid-19 may be weighing on investors on Wednesday. ""The delta variant is now traveling the world in a worrisome speed, hampering the prospects of economic recovery, yet again,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote, in a note to clients.  
  
The Stoxx Europe 600 index was under pressure, dropping 1% amid losses for banks and autos. The index was still set for a nearly 13% gain in the first half of the year. Data showed German jobless claims fell by 38,000 in June against a forecast for a fall of 20,000 from economists polled by The Wall Street Journal.  
  
U.S. stock futures also turned lower, following another record session for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite that was driven by upbeat economic data, while investors managed to brush aside some worries about the Delta variant. The S&P 500 is looking at an 8% gain for the second quarter and a 15% rise over six months, according to FactSet.  
  
Economic data is swinging back into focus on Wednesday, with the June ADP private-sector employment report and pending home sales on tap. But the biggest data point for investors will be Friday's nonfarm payroll data for June.  
  
Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi, which priced its initial public offering at $14, will make its trading debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday under the ticker DIDI."

You can laugh at me, I deserve it, but also I seek advice if you can offer it.. wtf should I do here to minimize my losses?

I actually didn't realize I was trading on a margin account.. it was just a normal investing acct before I applied to trade options.

I put in 2k cad and when I made the order for 20 conttacts it quoted me roughly 1k CAD.. I was fine with possibly losing 1k as a learning experience.

I'm now seeing this is a potentially much bigger mistake üòÇ I still don't fully understand what happened.. I made an order that cost more than the amount of cash I had in my margin account? Is that it?

I figure the lag for options IV will buy me some time. I happened to be doing that today with RKT (coincidentally watching the chart as it started to pop, and even with a 10 second lag, I was able to scalp up some 4dte calls quick and make a pretty penny.)

2021-06-30 01:06:42,wallstreetbets,"God is dead! Obviously. Modern man now intuits this fact. What part of our lives retain the mystery of former times? Is the recovery of this mystery--the state of believing that something greater than ourselves underlies our every action and every cause--is its recovery even desirable? Are our values then unmoored from a once so solid dock, and is speaking of values even meaningful without frames of reference?  
  
It's this frame of reference that is dead.  
  
Who welcomes the corn harvest with games and rituals? Their god is dead.  
  
Who flings their kin into the volcano's eye? Their god is dead.  
  
Who wraps their royals with fragranced linen, entombs them with stone formed and laid by the labor of slaves, so that their chance of boredom in the afterlife is diminished? They and their gods are dead.  
  
The world is filled with dead and buried gods, who come and go like crops. One season benefits their growth; another casts a sad and sallow field.   
  
The question then becomes, Which are our next gods? Which is to say, What values shall we cycle into?

Breakeven is $28.83 (15% downside protection) 

The spreads are pretty wide both ways, realistically if the market dumps every stock dumps 

My question is, is it just better trading put spreads on spy? Because the bid ask spread is only $1 as opposed to like $5 spreads on other stocks? Is it ‚Äúworth it‚Äù or not really basically is what I‚Äôm asking the reason id like CRSR is because on the 6 month chart it‚Äôs just been trading between $30 and $35 but I‚Äôm not really sure if it‚Äôs worth opening put spreads because of the wide bid ask spread

If real, I'm all in, and will squeeze right along with you, but first, based on what data?  I have some sources of short positions, but they vary so much I don't trust any of them.  Do you have a good source of true short positions?  I'd love to have your source if you are willing to offer it.  And traders like us help each other by sharing, cause hedge funds already have that info, so we aren't giving away the secret sauce by sharing it here on WSB with each other.  Its how we beat the big guys, traitors who want to short us or kill off WSB.  I even read an article I won't share about how we are all apparently now dead, which unless I'm a ghost and don't realize it, we aren't near dead.  Just another lie told buy desperate hedge funds caught gambling on shorts with their clients money, who would probably hang them all if they knew what they were doing with their money."

2021-06-29 21:48:37,wallstreetbets,"Dude that;s absolutely not sustainable. You can make more working less elsewhere, whatever you are doing.

My last job had unreasonable expectations & hours. I jumped ship for \~10% paycut, work a sick gig now with a bunch of reasonable folks and have more than made up for the cut by performing and requesting raises over the years. 

Your day to day happiness is worth more than whatever extra you are earning pulling hours like that."
2021-06-29 21:48:53,wallstreetbets,Climb that ladder if a promotion is near. Get some experience and you can move to another job if you still don‚Äôt like how things are going. Keep up the good work.

2021-06-29 21:47:10,wallstreetbets,"Higher up is usually more responsibility, more hours, and more pay.  Only you can decide if it‚Äôs worth it.  

It sounds like you already work retarded hours (assuming 5 days a week at 12 hour days?) so I would probably just seek other employment lol.  

It has been worth it for me because the pay is kind of baller but tbh I don‚Äôt want to work like this forever."
2021-06-29 21:48:22,wallstreetbets,I'd look for another job. That's not acceptable behavior.

Earnings are tomorrow premarket. Short interest is relatively low at 19.46% and likewise with the short ratio at 2.82. I'd tread with caution as this stock has run up earlier this month - this could be a selloff trigger.

&#x200B;

$FIZZ

Currently trading in a downward wedge pattern, earnings tomorrow after market hours (~~not July 14th, TradingView being rarted~~) could be the catalyst for a breakout. Also harbors a high 30.73% short interest and short ratio at 12.24.

&#x200B;

$YALA

June 20-23 had less than 100000 shares to borrow. Short interest is 30.07%, but low short float at 3.03. Fee rate has been going down but still remains at 30%. Breakout potential?

&#x200B;

$EH

Today, as well as June 23-25, have close to zero shares left to borrow (< 10000), and the borrow rate is hovering in the 11%-12% range. Short interest is at 25.5% currently, but down from 32.94% on June 11 (last time I checked it). Short ratio, however, has steadily increased to 2.4 (from 2.19 on 6/11, and 1.25 at the beginning of the month). Could be a good risk/reward play for earnings on July 9th.

&#x200B;

All of this data was gathered from these sources. This is not investment advice, but this disclaimer can't stop retards from buying anyway. I'll add some others later in the day, stay tuned.

Canadian Solar Inc. is a publicly traded company that manufactures solar PV modules and runs large scale solar projects

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CSIQ?p=CSIQ&.tsrc=fin-srch](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CSIQ?p=CSIQ&.tsrc=fin-srch)

It's market cap is only 2.8B with a float of 40M shars.

# Fundamentals

There are 3 compelling features in its business models:

1. Generates polysilicon solar panel
2. Pivoting to high margin battery storage for its large scale offering.
3. CSIQ is the *worlds second largest solar PV* producer.

CSIQ will be a cash cow soon because it's entering the high margin business of storing solar energy with each of its GW project.  Margins aren't high for solar project but they very high are for battery storage, servicing, and software services \[1\]

They are the #1 solar develop in Japan \[2\]

They are making inroads in the USA \[3\]

&#x200B;

# Technicals

The technical are compelling.

CSIQ has a very low float and 16% short interest so a squeeze is possible.

The Chart looks very good.  The stock is retracing back to its highs in the 60s.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eyabgc0sc9871.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1f32a724635c0f598b7287febbd43fe0976cdee

Moreover, they are recently listing on the STAR market (NASDAQ of China) which will likely make the value of their subsidiary more valuable.

They'll then use these funds to invest more in battery storage and the virtuous circle is complete as their share prices reaches into the 100s.

Much like AMD, when it went to 5nm, Solar utility projects with storage will be a huge game changer for the industry, margins and cashflow.

PRPL is trading at 1.7B Market cap and they are going to be at \~400M EBITDA in 3-5 years.

Nothing has changed except for some startup issues on equipment. Harmony pillow is capacity constrained, expansion is slowed due to capacity constraints.

2021-06-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"JD is good long term stock Hey Guys. my first DD on a stock.

Most  of you have heard about JD. It provides online retail, online  marketplace, and marketing services in China and serves as the main  competitor for Alibaba.

Much like other stocks during tech sell off, JD.Com suffered massive blows. Its current PE ratio is 14 which is unheard in the common e-commerce space.

Also,  JD stock has come down in anticipation of anti-trust crackdown of  chinese tech companies by chinese government. As we all know, this  started because Jack Ma could not keep his mouth shut and publicly said  that China rules are not every conducive for growth. As a result,  Government decided to make an example of tech companies and imposed them  with fines and maximum was imposed on BABA (4%).  No fines were levied  on JD.

JD got penalized with other  stocks. Also, JD.com‚Äôs 618 (June 18th) sales event is going very well   after selling $136 billion worth of goods last year helped fuel the   growth rally. 618 is JD.com‚Äôs response to Alibaba‚Äôs November Singles Day   event. A strong 618 event should be good for Walmart  which owns 5.39%  of the company and has historically promoted its goods on 618.

In  the first quarter, the Beijing-based company reported net revenue  of  203.2 billion yuan in the quarter ended March 31, an increase of 39%   year-on-year. Excluding items, JD.com posted a profit of 2.47 yuan per   American depository share (ADS), beating analysts‚Äô expectations of 2.26   yuan by 9.2%.

This is not new  territory for the company. On Mar. 11, JD.com  reported its  fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 earnings. In that  earnings release,  the company highlighted that it grew its active user  base by nearly  one-third in a single year and increased revenue and EPS  by 31.4% and  187.5%, respectively.

Despite this awesome performance, the company is trading at a steep discount to its 52-week high.

Overall, I am very positive on the stock and its trading at good discount. I am long on the stock.

I am not financial advisor. Please do your own research too. I am just an APE with a dream."

2021-06-29 23:15:04,wallstreetbets,"Fuck... this turned into a wall of text... sorry.
tl;dr; Institutional buyers aren't a sizable part of the typical housing market. Real estate investments are special. Buying individual housing units is a horrible strategy for the big boys. Realtors have been pushing this tune for a bit. Numbers out of context can be misleading, especially from FNMA/Freddie.

...

BlackRock isn't buying houses... they don't deal with individual pieces of real estate because it's simply to small a venture to care about at their scale. The asset management required for the sorts of people they employ makes it silly. What they do buy is blocks of foreclosed property (or they did, in 2008-2012, far as I know there haven't been any major blocks up since at least 2014, but there might be some areas). This is where the ""fed"" backed money came in. Fed gave them loans to pay for that.

ETFs can't invest in real estate, it's not a liquid asset or commodity. Which is why we have REITs. REITs aren't new, and as far as a I know, there isn't any publicly traded REIT specializing in single family home rentals... but there are a ton in the rental space and mortgage backed securities, it's one of the principle funding sources. REITs have to pay out 90% or more of their profits in dividends so it's a really cushy vehicle for fairly moderate returns... they are among the boomerist of boomer sectors (outside 2007-2012 and 2020). There are private REITs that are open to some investment for qualified investors generally that do specialize in flipping properties, but they are pretty small potatoes and honestly I haven't even seen them advertising for investors in years so maybe not a thing anymore (they were all the rage in real estate professional circles in 2009ish)

A big source of the ""Everyone should fear the corporate buyer"" mentality is NRA. The biggest purchasers of single family homes in the corporate space are Zillow and OpenDoor who make no bones about being perfectly fine with deleting Realtors from the equation if consumers will accept it. Professionally, I've only seen a hand full of ""cash alternative"" buyers and they were in price ranges that have zero effect on affordable housing... if multi-millionares want to blow money out bidding each other to pay for a contractor special with a cute blog and a silly story... I'm ok with that.

SFR prices and rental prices are almost completely disconnected in MOST markets. There are some unique ones where the rental market is just so dominant and redevelopment for higher density isn't an option for some reason. Beach communities, college towns, bay area... those aren't normal, but they exist. Even for investment firms, they have a cost to money. They have to get returns... So let's say you have a 500k house and it rents for 2k a month (I'm in a pretty high market, but these are typical numbers for us)... gross income is 5% per year... let's be generous and knock off 1% for tax, insurance, and management fees. How many years do you think that 4% profit margin lasts without upkeep? It's not a bad return, and if you know the market your in and can watch your properties like a hawk to keep good tenants and avoid bad ones it's a great retirement vehicle for most people going from lower middle class to upper middle class wealth... but for yield chasers it's a boring high effort asset class that comes with structural risks and none of the tax advantages regular people can employ. Paying 10%+ over market takes it from a 'safe' investment to rolling dice and depending on market appreciation for returns. Again, that's cool if your holding for 20 years and it's a retirement nest egg, it's slit your wrist territory if your a fund manager who has to mark to market.

The in-balance between buyers and sellers isn't shocking and is almost entirely due to interest rates. We saw a huge run up this winter and into spring as buyers payed through the nose enticing people who didn't care about COVID into selling and now we're seeing it tack back down to more normal levels after the typical spring buying season. 

The 4m number you quoted is from Freddie Mac and is more relating to new construction than actual inventory.... it's not that we have 4m people trying to buy homes and can't... it's that we need 4m more housing units (not just SFR, that number would include multifamily, condo, attached units ect) to meet eventual demand in a marco sense including immigration and family growth.... it's also about 2/3 of the number of existing housing units sold annually (drops to half when you add in new construction, which we do maybe 1.2m-1.5m but probably increasing since increasing prices and interest rates are going to make development math easier with lumber and metal coming back to just 'high' instead of 'fuck that'). That number is up 50% since 2018... in 2017/2018 we were in a relatively flat market... so perspective here is sort of key."

2021-06-30 13:57:47,wallstreetbets,"828 may be 16% higher than 715.. but that makes it sound like an alarming number of people are dying. 715/100000= .00715 = .715% death rate. 828/100000=.00828=.828%. .715% deathrate. So per 1000 people 8 people died instead of 7 the previous year, hardly alarming, and a few years previous the death rate was 6/1000. And that's assuming the numbers provided are correct because as another poster pointed out those numbers are estimates"
2021-06-30 17:39:04,wallstreetbets,"That's over 300,000 excess deaths in a year when we shut down everything, which probably reduced the number of work and traffic related deaths. If we hadn't shut anything down or practiced social distancing there easily could have been millions of deaths. That's a pretty big deal, IMO."

  Just checking the CME futures prices for HRC today and everything is green. 2021's are up ~2% and October futures are almost at $1,800.

  But 2022's futures are ~+5% across the board, with every month now at +$1,000 even extending to Jan 2023 ($1,020 +6% today).

  If 2021's $5B EBITDA guidance was done on an average price of $1,100 and now we're at $1,800 and also going to have ~$1,200 prices during 2022 and close to $1,000 in 2023, then all estimations are off and we should be seeing higher prices.

2021-06-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMD passed the MOON and MARS... Galaxy S/22 is next!!! (hop on!) # DEAR APES,

A few weeks ago I began posting on AMD. At the time, the stock was trading in the mid-70's.

Today, as expected, we crossed $90 price... but our trip is just getting **STARTED**!

The deal with TESLA was announced, as well as the next AMAZING technologies in Computex, including the stacked cache for Zen3, Fidelity FX Super Resolution, the 6900 XTX Liquid Cooled, etc.

There's a very simple reason why AMD will go past the MOON and MARS: **ENTERTAINMENT**

The world revolves around entertainment and in this new era, this activity is mandatory to deal with Covid-19, the lack of international travel, work from home, etc.

TESLA adopting AMD for its new Model X and S is HUGE. It will take a Navi23 and an APU (two chips) per car, likely becoming an optional for all other vehicles in the future. More automobile brands will follow, as TESLA is leading the way in the industry.

&#x200B;

[TESLA selected AMD chips for its upcoming vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/aekg7gm3u8871.jpg?width=2243&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c178f47df42b4159f92d1248ac9618a3f8440643)

With autonomous driving, gaming in a long trip will be mandatory. But even without it, the rest of the passengers can game, either with their fellow companions or online, from their car.

So, yes, the current automotive revolution will have AMD as a main supplier.

Then you have consumer processing, which includes CPU's and GPU's, where AMD is dominating (mostly on the former). The Zen3 architecture is a MONSTER. Intel just cannot compete. And with the stacked cache providing up to 15% more gaming performance, that lead will continue on AMD's side.

On GPU's, AMD's Navi31 is expected to be MCM (multi-chip module), aiming to repeat AMD's success with Intel, but now against NVIDIA. ""Chiplets"" allow for economies of scale to thrive. More silicon, with less defects, better binning, cheaper... it is an AMAZING IDEA. Just add cache and the latency problem can be mitigated.

On console gaming, AMD is the undisputed KING. They're in the PS4, PS4 Pro, PS5, Xbox model and series X/S. Also in the Aya Neo and expected in Valve's next handheld, which will be a MONSTER.

On Datacenter, AMD is groundbreaking. Epyc and the new offerings from **GOOGLE** for virtual machines is an INCREDIBLE deal. **AMAZON, TENCENT, ALIBABA, AZURE** (Microsoft), they are all buying chips from AMD. More CORES means MORE power processing, lower energy, lower licensing costs and certainly better SECURITY (as INTEL has been plagued by Spectre & Meltdown issues). AMD is now expected to go from 64 cores in EPYC to 96... and also 128. That's just ludicrous, 128 CORES and 256 threads. And X86 clients are THRILLED to buy more power in a more efficient chip.

[Google wants AMD Milan Epyc Chips for its Datacenter](https://preview.redd.it/36x8ygt6u8871.jpg?width=2284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d96e3eab884218203d9fbe906b9ba3474902e13)

Deals with the US Department of Energy (El Capitan), Singapore and Germany, all for public datacenters worth millions of dollars. That's just the tip of the iceberg, as private players are taking note of EPYC.

Last, **but certainly NOT least: MOBILE**

AMD will power Samsung's S22 flagship phone. Its GPU is expected to break records, as engineering samples already have it beating MALI and Apple's options, by **double digits**.

**Samsung** is delighted and **Google** also wants AMD chips for its phones.

&#x200B;

[Samsung wants AMD's chips for its flagship GALAXY S22](https://preview.redd.it/xu07hgobu8871.jpg?width=1919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfea79ba818835fb83a9cb5f51d5189cf2d034e0)

But enough on the PRODUCTS. What about the fundamentals?

Revenue growth is expected at 50% by the end of 2021. How many companies are growing by 50%?

And that guidance was provided with the Q1 results in April, which were exceeding expectations. AMD raised the guidance from 37% to 50%... and will certainly BEAT IT.

AMD is NOW a profitable company... and it literally CANNOT keep its products on shelves, as its clients are buying ALL THEIR CHIPS.

AMD's valuation is $110 billion, while NVIDIA (w/slightly more revenue & profit) is $500 billion.

How is NVIDIA 5 times the value of AMD???... Just because of a stock split?

It is currently trading at 38 times earnings, which if they grow by 50% in 6 months, will certainly drop.

So yeah, the stock is currently above $90 and aiming to reach its all-time high of $99 which was reached a few months ago, in January.

Analyst consensus of the stock is currently $106.54 ([https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast)) which is roughly an 18% upside, taking it to a mere $ 132 billion market cap.

If you ask me, AMD should be **at least HALF** of NVIDIA's $500 billion market cap.

Lastly, the Xilinx acquisition, which will aim to create synergies among functions (e.g. HR, Procurement, Engineering, etc.). It will also increase AMD's share of the silicon purchasing world, as TSMC will have AMD as its #2 client, only second to Apple.

Xilinx cancelled its dividends as its shareholders approved the merger with AMD.

AMD may choose to bring dividends back after the merger... yet in the meantime, they announced a $4 Billion share buyback program. They know their stock is trading **CHEAP**.

# On the positions (full disclosure): YES, I hold AMD stock.

I bought $25K back in 2013, when the stock was at $2.46 (on January 18th, 2013), a bit over 10150 stocks. I saw the stock go up to $20 and sold half of it in 2018. Later, I bought back a bit (crazy ape mentality).

Today, I stand with 7500 stocks. Certainly worth a couple of Lambo's, yet I drive a Nissan.

If you ask me, my next car should be a TESLA... with AMD chips (yet I'm not selling AMD).

WE ALREADY PASSED THE MOON, we will pass **MARS** (Tesla) and also our **Galaxy** (Samsung).

# Join me, together we will conquer the Universe!!!

Pack your bananas.... we're in for a journey!"

2021-06-29 20:09:16,wallstreetbets,"Look, it is scratching $90 right now. If it crosses $94... it will overshoot to $106.

The reasons are simple:

1- analysts are bullish on the stock.

2- Xilinx acquisition is being greenlit by all regulators (US, UK, etc.).

3- It reports earnings in less than 30 days (end of July). They will beat, almost certainly.

4- We enter 2nd half of 2021 with the Delta variant. Home Entertainment will be huge.

So yes, I expect a stock price of 3 digits soon."
2021-06-29 20:04:05,wallstreetbets,"I see $130 before the end of the year... $200 would take a bit longer. Likely Q3 2022.

**Note:** AMD's market cap is $100 billion, while NVIDIA's is $500 billion

Basically, AMD trades at a fifth of the valuation, having a bit less revenue & profit.

If AMD traded at the same multiples as NVIDIA, it would be at $270. But it doesn't.

On the automakers, I see Mercedes/Daimler-Benz with AMD, as they're F1 partners.

Volkswagen is key (as it has Audi, Porsche, Lambo, etc), but I see them with AMD too.

The automotive revolution is here and AMD is sitting STRONG.

Why???... Because AMD has the most efficient chips (lower energy with more performance).

This is **KEY** for electrical vehicles, both for the CPU and GPU."

Everyone will catch the virus eventually... but if you are vaccinated, it will be mild.

If you were NOT vaccinated, you would be putting your life on the line.

It will take months for the whole world to be vaccinated.

So yeah, expect masks and work from home until 2022."
2021-06-29 20:16:12,wallstreetbets,"No, the $130 price target by EoY is more reasonable.

That would be a market cap of $156bn.

Still, just a fraction of NVIDIA's $500bn in market cap.

If AMD traded with the same multiples as NVIDIA, the price would be $270.

But that will take time...

We first need to see 128 cores/256 threads Epyc Genoa Datacenter chips.

We also need to see the Tesla's on the road with AMD's hardware.

Lastly, we need the Samsung Galaxy S/22 and Valve's handheld device.

Once those products are out, the price will skyrocket."

Wait until Winter comes back... we may have an Omega variant by then.

Australians (winter) are hoping for luck: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/29/can-australia-contain-the-covid-delta-variant](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/29/can-australia-contain-the-covid-delta-variant)

Sure, it all comes down to personal odds. But the virus already killed millions.

Millions more may have preexisting conditions that aggravate Covid-19.

Not to mention the risk of saturating the healthcare infrastructure.

Again, the war is far from over... and experts don't expect it to end this year."
2021-06-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Ford Motor company - A free options play So here I‚Äôve detailed a 3 legged options play I‚Äôve executed today.

Ford motor company.
All options expiring July 16th

Buy to open a put @13.5 strike.
Cost is 0.08$ rn

Buy to open a call @15$ strike.
Cost is 0.63$ rn

Sell to open a put @15.5$ strike
Selling for 0.71$ rn.

So you get 71$ from the sale.
You pay 71$ for the other contracts.

Right now it costs you 0 to execute this strat. (I just did this and cost me 0.8$ per contract because commission is a thing)

If Ford hypothetically tanks. You‚Äôve hedged yourself position by buying and selling the put spread play. Max loss per contract is capped @200$ that way.

But if Ford goes up. It‚Äôs free profit.
You paid essentially nothing for the call.

3 legged option strat. Which costs 0$ to execute rn. Hhhhh

Am I crazy? If there‚Äôs a hole in my logic here PLEASE tell me about it. Relatively new on this horse.

But I reckon as long as Ford closes on the 16th above 15.3$ I‚Äôm in profit."

2021-06-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"So far only reported in local papers- $TELL clears another big hurdle- signs long term lease with port of lake charles As far as I know, this news has only been reported in the local paper but for anyone that follows Tellurian, this is a huge deal. 

Go to 16:20 in the video that ill post in the comments. 

Tellurian is signing a long term $1.86M per year lease with the port of lake charles. Tellurian Chairman Charif Souki has previously said to watch out for the signing of this lease as construction of the Driftwood LNG facility will commence shortly after.  I think the market is overlooking this big news. 

Recently, Tellurian signed two $12B LNG offtake deals. More deal announcements should be expected soon. This is the closest the $17B driftwood lng project has been to reality (Tellurian is debt free, $24B signed deals, global nat gas prices are highest they have ever been) but the company is trading at the low end of the pre covid range (1.8b market cap). Pre covid it bounced around from 1.6-2.7b. Stock should easily be double what it is today and there are plenty potential catalysts ahead that will make the outlook even better. 

High risk/high reward play here."

Blackberry is an innovation icon and a pioneer in smart car ecosystem. Blackberry IVY advisory council now includes GEICO TELUS HERE AWS CERENCE and it's expected to be launched in February 22.

Just today Blackberry was awarded 4 patents and they have nearly 500 new patents pending approval.

Blackberry Patent sale is nearly complete. This is going to be in billions and it's likely Facebook is the buyer of the patents and Blackberry may be partnering with Facebook to secure WhatsApp Messenger

When asked about patent sale, CEO John Chen said stay tuned. He meant hold don't sell your shares because Good News is Coming Soon.

Blackberry recently beat revenue estimates in Q1 FY 22 and went on a hiring spree. They upped sales hiring and expected to increase foot on the street by 23% this quarter.

In the quarter Blackberry customer wins include US Canadian and European Gov. In addition to highly regulated industries such Bank of China.

Don't sell your Blackberry shares only to discover that Facebook paid Blackberry over 2 billion in royalties and Blackberry and Facebook partnered to secure WhatsApp and will split revenues 50/50

More recently Facebook announced WhatsApp stores and messenger for Enterprise with premium. Blackberry could have their finger in this new venture by Facebook and it's a win win situation both both companies.

Blackberry Facebook partnership is very likely and the news could be out very soon.

Who isn't partnering with Blackberry these days.

Blackberry is on the world's stage dancing with the giants. You must pay attention who they are hanging around with and why. From Amazon AWS to Geico to Microsoft, Telus, and Baidu, Here, Cerence, Vodafone Verizon.

Is Facebook next. I wonder.

Buying AC's isn't a one time thing though, you have to buy filters.. next up is fire season so guess what ? More air purifiers and filters.

Right now carrier AC's have been sold out almost everywhere and there's basically waitlists to get an AC.  Now Carrier is a solid stock and its been on a tear but the heat wave discussions started last week and Carrier has moved from $46.50 to $48.84 .. does that move sound like wallstreet has priced in blow out earnings?

2021-06-30 00:22:45,wallstreetbets,"I was only homeless for like 6 months so it wasn't THAT hard. First off, I bought a shitfuck of a car for $2,400 cash to live in that I made selling drugs (big part of why I was homeless to begin with, turns out I liked coke so much because I have gnarly adhd and stimulants help that, got a nice healthy(ish) adderall script now and don't ever even feel high when I take it, just normal) I got a job at a company that does lights and power for concerts and weddings for a dollar above minimum wage, real roughneck kinda work hauling heavy shit around in the sun and hoping not to die on 25' ladders every day. I lived in the parking lot, where there was a bathroom with a shower I could use every morning. Boss even gave me a key to it (it was a shared bathroom area for a few companies that shared the lot, so the ""dons"" had keys). Me and one other guy at the company lived in the parking lot together, and he had a decent van that didn't drive but was chill to hang out in and had lots of electrical outlets. For fun after work we would drink CHEAP beers, listen to podcasts, play music poorly (I'm a drummer, I used home depot buckets and this one weirdly vertical rock, he had a guitar), and play horseshoes. I saved up enough after a while and had a few thousand dollars in my bank that I used to get a room in an unofficial halfway home that some old guy with 3 200lb+ dogs (who I suspected might be a ex-serial killer) ran. Lived with a heroin/meth junkie who worked as a fisherman, a couple who enjoyed ROUGH torture bdsm type of sex and domestic violence (so it was always a fun mystery to figure out if the screaming was pleasure or abuse), and a semi-retarded man in his late 40s who was a golfcourse groundskeeper. My rent was going to outpace my earnings, so a friend of mine got me a job as a waiter at a seafood restaurant, where I worked hella hard and did a very good job at and would sometimes be walking home with $100-$200 in my pocket in tips on a great night. Saved up from that for a nice computer so I could pursue the only thing I've ever given a fuck about, which is filmmaking. I learned editing by spending my weekends doing random stupid personal projects for practice, and my skills learned doing the concerts/weddings taught me enough to be competent working on the lighting crews of small film sets. I kept learning and saving until I felt I was good enough at everything to move to LA. Saved a bit more so I'd have 6 months of expenses to find work, and moved to LA. Got another job doing event lighting that paid better in LA, and got some gigs doing set lighting that would give my savings a nice boost here and there. Set lighting gigs (at least at my low level) last at most a few weeks, but it's a well paid few weeks, and editing gigs can range from a month to a year. The life is/was get a steady editing gig for a while, and when that runs out, take all the set lighting jobs I can find until another steady editing gig comes along, and do events if nothing is popping up. I'm currently assistant editing on my first real show that will actually get picked up by a streaming service and seen by thousands/millions of people, couldn't be happier. Well on my way to joining both unions, which guarantees a minimum (and very high) payrate and access to bigdick hollywood productions (can't work on avengers etc if you're not union). With the pay from my editing gig I'm on track to getting my own meager apartment (which is like 1300 in rent here, fml) later this year. Longterm plan is to have a fully kitted grip truck (everything having to do with set lighting besides the actual lights themselves) that I will use and get paid to light shows in between editing gigs, and when I do have an editing gig, I can rent the truck/gear out for some passive income. Should be pretty fuckin set in about 5 years. 



Some pointers:


1. foodstamps are literally free money. There is no shame, it's fucking free, why the fuck not?


2. find a regular place u can shower


3. talk to the people who own stores around you and stuff. Every now and then I was able to get free shit


4. I cannot possibly say enough about my girlfriend and how much she helped me through some of these times. From laundry, to a nice place to sleep, to a good homecooked meal, and so much more. Gonna marry the shit out of her when she's done with school. Find someone who likes you that will let you respectfully do things you couldn't otherwise do using their resources. 


5. It's real easy to identify as a ""shitfuck poor"" and drink yourself into oblivion etc every night. Don't. You're not poor, you're broke. There's a big difference in mindset. 


6. Don't do drugs and don't smoke cigarettes. I vape, it's like 10X cheaper than cigs if you make your own juice. Weed is also pretty cheap if you have friends in the industry, but don't be that dumbfuck spending $50 on an 1/8 and wonder why you have no money.


7. Knowledge is pretty much free in modern society. Youtube can teach you anything.


8. Have a vision of yourself as a NOT broke as fuck degenerate. Work towards that every day. Every action, ""does this help me get to where I wanna be?"", deciding what to do becomes simple when you ask that question. 





And that's my story :)


Kinda nice to write it all out, sorry if that's more than you bargained for, but it was kinda therapeutic for me. Onward and upward motherfucker!"

Knives you should have if you are semi-serious about cooking:

A good, comfortable, sharp chef‚Äôs knife (most of the work)

A boning knife (I like the curved Victorinox)

* He was previously an electrician, and a plumber.
* He was trained and became a Nuclear Safety Advisor. Inspection type. This was civil service. Same job title as Homer Simpson, way more dangerous.
* He knew going in that someday he would reach Maximum exposure to radiation. It's a safety protocol to start with, they do that so you don't end up riddled with cancerous tumors. My old man was such a mensch that he put his ass on the line for us. Did yours? 
* My father worked at every Nuclear power plant on the east coast, not just for some company.
* The government still keeps tabs on him, and approaches him quietly ever 10-15 years to ask him if he would be willing to serve his country one last time in case of a nuclear containment issue. Not that you would care that he'd sacrifice his life to save others voluntarily. That's what a man is. What's your excuse? 


> And then he couldn't compete in a free market, against lowest common demonitator labour.

* A free market has regulations, and typically an even playing field. Easy to compete with Americans who have to carry insurance, pay employees a marketable wage, and in some cases, carry heath insurance based on state laws, mandates, etc.
* Democrats purposefully allowed immigration to spiral out of control, hoping to create a new voting base. Same thing they do today. They purposefully flooded the USA with cheap foreign labor, who did not have to play by the same rules. If Rodriguez Roofing does a shit job, or makes a mistake, they hop in the van and vamanos no aqui amigo. Why? They don't have to have insurance. They also don't have to pay taxes, or do withholding, and can field 3x as many men to the same job site for the same amount of money, because they are illegal. No I-9 boss. So they pay them under the table, back then 5 dollars an hour. Were they legal immigrants, they'd have had to follow the rules. A free market still has to be a fair market place. Cause and effect. They wanted to punish white blue collar workers. That's why white blue collar workers don't vote for the democrats. See how that works? 
* Denominator*
* He still managed to get buy, and not complain and whine about wanting someone else to do it for him. He has more grit in left nut than you do in your entire body.


> Sounds like the system works.

* It works really well overall. 89% of the world population lived in poverty before the advent of capitalism in the North American, European, Asian, South American, African, and Australian continents.
* It'd work a lot better if politicians would stop trying to make mandates. Markets don't respect mandates."

2021-06-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$TSP: The best way to play self-driving today (up 84% since my post a month ago) TL;DR: Trucking will be the first viable business for autonomous vehicles. TuSimple ($TSP) currently has the best autonomous truck tech and is the closest to commercialization. 

[TuSimple Stock: The Driverless Truck Stock That Counts NVIDIA and Cathie Wood as Investors](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/979f72e4-7022-3f0e-a9a5-e20306d3e48e/tusimple-stock-the.html)

# Why not Robotaxis?

Robotaxis are sexier and thus get all the media attention. But commercialization of robotaxis currently poses several technical, operational, and business challenges. 

## Why not Robotaxis: Technical

Robotaxis are most profitable in downtown environments. But those environments also pose the greatest challenges for an autonomous vehicle due to the large number of hard-to-predict agents. No company has been able to solve those yet. 

Pick up and drop offs are also technically very challenging because, frankly, most Uber/Lyft pick up and drop offs in downtown environments are in illegal locations. Human drivers can get away with that. But a computer system cannot be programmed to perform illegal actions without the company being held responsible.

## Why not Robotaxis: Operational

With Uber or Lyft, the drivers do much more than just drive. They purchase, store, clean, fuel/charge, and maintain their vehicles. With robotaxis, all of this operational load falls to the robotaxi company. Where are they going to store thousands of vehicles in downtown environments? How are they going to charge them and perform all of the other operational tasks? Even if this problem could be solved, it means that robotaxis will scale much more slowly than Uber or Lyft did.

## Why not Robotaxis: Business

The cost of robotaxis is currently extremely high due to the compute and sensor requirements. Even if they perform perfectly, it will take a long time before they are more profitable than vehicles with human drivers.

Further, recent regulation in the US has shown that the public support is behind the drivers, not the silicon valley companies. Driving for Uber and Lyft has been a lifeline to people who lost their jobs during the pandemic. So robotaxis are going to be viewed with hostility and likely backlash from the public and thus from governments. 

# Why Trucking?

## Why Trucking: Technical

Highway driving, though higher speed, is much more structured than downtown environments. In most ways it is much easier, as evidenced by current level 2 driver assistance systems that easily handle most highway driving. It does, however, require much longer range perception. We will return to that below.

## Why Trucking: Operational

Trucks already have all of the operational infrastructure. They are stored at depots. They have dedicated staff for their cleaning, maintenance, fueling, etc. Making trucks autonomous can simply leverage all of this infrastructure.

## Why Trucking: Business

There is currently a shortage of truck drivers. Freight shippers want to ship faster (and not need to wait for drivers to sleep). Truck driving is not a fun or healthy job. It keeps people away from their families. And trucking is a $4T industry globally ($1T in the US). 

Given the long lifespan of trucks and their ability to run for millions of miles, the cost of the autonomous compute and sensor system can be amortized much better than for robotaxis.

In short, the stars are all aligned for autonomous trucks today.

# Why TuSimple? 

The players who started with robotaxis have built their entire tech stack around detailed but short range perception. Trying to convert that tech stack to trucking poses more challenges than one might expect. But since TuSimple has focused on trucking from the beginning (2015), they have built their stack to have 1000 meter perception - more than 4x other companies.

TuSimple also has been building up partnerships with the rest of the international freight ecosystem since the beginning. They have key partnerships with OEMs, Tier 1s, shipping companies, and part manufacturers in the US, Europe, and Asia. None of the other autonomous companies have that.

TuSimple is also building their Autonomous Freight Network across the US in multiple phases. Initially, only corridors with favorable weather will be autonomous. But as the technology improves to be able to handle heavy rain and snow, additional corridors can be easily flipped from manual to autonomous mode. 

## But, but, aren‚Äôt they Chinese?

They definitely have ties to China. Their first investors were Chinese. So what? 

This actually gives them an advantage vs pure US players: they have easy access to the entire trucking market in China.

# Conclusion

Given all of the above, TuSimple is undervalued with its current valuation of about $15B. Some other self-driving companies are around $30B or more, despite facing all of the challenges mentioned. 

In other words: TSP to the moon, apes!"

Edit: It's been pointed out to me that owning shares of this company can be a headache come tax season. Options are fine. Look it up.

**TLDR;**

\* Established player in the oil and natural gas industry, with over 90,000 miles of pipeline in 38 states and Canada.

\* Recently increased their footprint with the acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners ($ENBL), which is expected to be finalized in the coming months. Poised to capitalize on that purchase with increased operational efficiency and an upgraded credit rating.

\* Blew the lid off earnings in May.

\* Currently undervalued, with strong buy recommendations from nearly every outlet.

\* Earnings estimates revised up; expected to beat forecasts when they report in August.

\* Juicy dividend

\*Dirt cheap options

# I. Company Breakdown

So, who are these guys? They're a long-standing behemoth in the market, established in 1996, with a market cap of $29.6 billion. They have diverse holdings in energy infrastructure, from pipelines to storage facilities, and deal in natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil, and refined oil products.

Their large footprint (made larger by the recent $7.2 billion, all-equity purchase of $ENBL) allows them to leverage their size (you know, like your wife's boyfriend) to operate more efficiently, and they‚Äôve been spending the last 25 years reinvesting those profits to continue building out their infrastructure. They own Lake Charles LNG, and also hold stakes in Sunoco LP ($SUN) and USA Compression Partners ($USAC).

In addition, they hold patents related to dual-drive natural gas compression technology, and have international offices in Beijing and Canada. Their CEO and co-founder is Kelsy Warren, a dude who‚Äôs been in the oil and gas industry his entire career leading various companies. He was ranked 299 on the Forbes 400 list in 2020, so he‚Äôs clearly successful at what he does.

\*\*Side note\*\* Warren has a collection of music memorabilia that includes an autograph of Jackson Browne and drumsticks signed by The Eagles, so depending on where you stand in relation to those bands, he‚Äôs either a complete poser, or definitely fuks. Either way, the guy knows how to profit in his line of work, and for our purposes, that‚Äôs what matters.

&#x200B;

# II. Operations

$ET‚Äôs Q1 earnings report from May 6th, 2021 was full of good news. Some of the highlights:

\-Revenue of $17B, up 46.2% YOY, beating analyst estimates of $11.7B

\-Net income of $3.28B, up 484.7% YOY

\-Diluted EPS of $1.21, up 478.1% YOY

\-Net profit margin of 19.3%, up 365.3% YOY

\-Operating income of $4.07B, up 193.8% YOY

\-Cash on hand of $355M, up 81.1% YOY

\-Repaid $3.7B in debt with cash flow from operations

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

These guys are super efficient at what they do. Like...tweakers on an assembly line efficient. For every dollar in assets that they own, they generate 46 cents in sales. This compares to an industry average of 33 cents, and is expected to increase with the incorporation of $ENBL's existing network, to the tune of about $100M annually. This excludes additional upside from their upgraded credit rating, more cash flow from ‚Äúfor-a-fee‚Äù contracts, and cost savings related to \*corporate synergy\* (sorry Kenny in the mail room, your job may be in danger).

Their sales are expected to grow 58.9% YOY, compared to an industry average of 15.5%, and their EPS, which has historically grown at a rate of 3.1%, is expected to grow by 986.1% this year. This compares to an industry average of 6.8%.

The company paid a quarterly dividend of 15.25 cents per share in May, or 61 cents per share on an annualized basis. This represents a dividend yield of 5.7%. As the company accelerates paying down their debt, they plan to return value to shareholders, either in the form of a higher dividend, or through share buybacks.

# III. Analyst Consensus

More good news across the board.

&#x200B;

[The Wall Street Journal rates $ET as a strong buy, with 14 out of 18 analysts giving it a buy rating, 1 giving an overweight rating, and 3 giving a hold rating. None gave a sell rating.](https://preview.redd.it/31cvqr9j58871.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=95ed1933a78c8fcb1f8458878298ea5bf4dc9e11)

&#x200B;

[CNN similarly gives $ET a buy rating, with 14 analysts advising to buy, 1 advising the stock will outperform, and 3 advising to hold. None advise to sell. They give a median price target of $13.50, with a high of $18 and a low of $11. This represents a median increase of 25.93&#37; over their last price target of $10.72.](https://preview.redd.it/d6jc3cjs58871.png?width=390&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9a9b9dc14e0f5ca3dd96907396a315a99a9c0b5)

&#x200B;

[Tipranks has a strong buy rating, with 8 out of 8 analysts giving buy ratings, with an average price target of $13.50, the high being $18, and the low being $12.](https://preview.redd.it/6h8sgbaw58871.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=69cd34bb1c86fc281355e9356c18d486f91ef2a3)

&#x200B;

# IV: Technical Analysis

&#x200B;

Since trading in the $6-7 range in early February, $ET has enjoyed a significant bull run. After a selloff on June 17th and 18th, it bounced back a bit, and spent most of last week consolidating.

&#x200B;

[It‚Äôs currently sitting at the bottom of its channel, using Bollinger Bands as a guide, as seen below. If it continues falling, it appears to have strong support around $10.50.](https://preview.redd.it/58sxgqjb68871.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=094c52f831e06f73740b6706b5cd35429b2b6a0b)

Using a MACD overlay, we see that the stock price may indeed continue to pull back a bit, but I expect the $10.50 support to hold, indicating a continuation of the uptrend.

[We‚Äôre looking for the blue line to cross back over the red. I expect this will happen this week, especially if the price drops further and tests support in the $10.50 range. ](https://preview.redd.it/urg4oa5f68871.png?width=913&format=png&auto=webp&s=588494349d7294b1396b4c5f19a03917fef24ca2)

&#x200B;

[Using VWAP, we confirm what we see using the Bollinger Bands; the stock price is at the very bottom of the channel, and has consistently bounced off of that as it continues to rise.](https://preview.redd.it/ggs4ikjl68871.png?width=1212&format=png&auto=webp&s=48de77b541fb807c756f712054d123dd4100fcc2)

&#x200B;

# V: Bear Case

Like any company in the oil and gas sector, $ET is susceptible to more stringent government regulations and/or taxes on the industry. This could impact their bottom line, as well as curtail future expansion.

$ET still holds a significant amount of debt, and while it has largely accrued these liabilities in order to build out their infrastructure and acquire smaller companies, its debt has risen at a greater rate than many of their peers. This could hamper $ET‚Äôs growth in the future if the industry hits a particularly rough patch.

There is always the prospect of international turmoil causing a disruption to their business. Last year, when Russia and Saudi Arabia were at odds regarding oil production, prices collapsed, and threw a major wrench into the works of US producers.

The delta variant of the coronavirus could send countries back into lockdown, stifling demand for oil and natural gas.

Critics have expressed concern that $ET outlays too much money for capital expenditures.

It‚Äôs boomer as fuck.

&#x200B;

# VI. Conclusion

Alright wrinkle brains, that about sums it up. The broad thesis here is that this is simply a solid company that is continuing to grow. They have a proven track record, and continue to execute at an extremely high level (much like Texas with prisoners). Basically, almost every analyst sees $ET as being currently undervalued with plenty of wind in their sails. They have strong buy recommendations across the board, without a single analyst in the multiple sources I consulted recommending to sell. This is despite being up just over 72% in the past six months.

After hitting $11.35 on June 16th, the stock pulled back slightly and has started to consolidate. Monday of this week reinforced my theory that there was still a small amount of selling that would occur, but that the stock would find support around $10.50. It did exactly that - fell in the morning to around $10.50, and then traded flat most of the day, closing at $10.37. I think this represents a good entry point, and will be looking to add to my position in the coming week - especially if it dips further. With the acquisition of $ENBL, natural gas prices at highs not seen since late 2018, overall bullish outlook for the sector, and the strong prospect of a massive infrastructure bill set to pass, I expect $ET to continue to outperform analyst estimates, and deliver strong quarterly results for the remainder of the year and into 2023.

&#x200B;

**How to play it: Options are dirt cheap, and weeklies are available.**

July 16th $11.50 calls are currently between .04-.05. A little further OTM at the $13 strike, they‚Äôre between .01-.02.

August 20th $11 calls are between .36-.38. Further OTM at $13, they‚Äôre .09-.10. Even ITM calls are crazy inexpensive. August 20th $10 calls are .76-.83.

Shares, as always, are the safer bet. $ET isn‚Äôt going anywhere, and the stock price looks like it‚Äôs coiling for a breakout.

I‚Äôm not a financial analyst, and this is not financial advice on how to invest your money. Do your own research and DD, and please feel free to poke holes in my thesis and tell me where you think I‚Äôve missed the mark.

Positions: 100 shares, x30 July 16th $12c, x50 July 16th $13.50c (that I'll probably roll to August), x40 August 20th $14c

Dividend stocks are tricky for options plays, but just don't enter in the weeks just before the ex dividend date.

Speaking of dividend, it's currently half of historical levels because they were paying down debt from too many acquisitions. They've made a lot of progress on that thanks to the huge payday during the Texas freeze. Once the dividend goes back to previous levels expect the share price to return to 2019 levels... at the very least. There is plenty of room to run for ET.

2021-06-30 07:32:23,wallstreetbets,I also bought under 10. Going to ride it to 30 for a nice profit.
2021-06-29 22:18:07,wallstreetbets,"Same, I sold 950 shares of clov @14$ to buy 950 shares of wish @13.95. Didn't think it would dip that much."
2021-06-30 09:38:17,wallstreetbets,"Just bought 15 shares (which is quite some money for me) and i have absolutely no idea what this company is. Why are they that good?

I just read a lot of üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ and bought"
2021-06-29 20:29:47,wallstreetbets,Hopefully they'll come pick us up! You're a little further down the street than I am but not by much!
2021-06-30 03:46:06,wallstreetbets,all in WISH or all in SOFI?
2021-06-30 13:16:00,wallstreetbets,Is it $WISH or $WKSH?
2021-06-30 12:16:24,wallstreetbets,I think we see $30 faster than that.
2021-06-30 01:21:21,wallstreetbets,Ahhh!! Same bought puts! Made money!

2021-06-29 20:24:23,wallstreetbets,"Wish is trash dude. It's just a meme like AMC, be careful."
2021-06-30 09:48:06,wallstreetbets,"Nah it‚Äôs a Meme stock. People will get tired of being duped into buying the cheapest dollar store shit and give up on WISH. Customer service is a joke. 

Not much growth story with falsely leading customers. 

Get out while you‚Äôve made a few bucks."

2021-06-29 20:53:12,wallstreetbets,I already sold off some draft kings for it. I got knocked out the other day when my stop loss tripped (yeah yeah) and now I rebought and I‚Äôm down 5%. I mean I‚Äôm up 20% but that fucking red man.
2021-06-30 17:48:09,wallstreetbets,"I bought 10 shares on April 7th.  No idea why, but it was $31 then.  Really wish I'd have bought way more."

2021-06-30 16:21:46,wallstreetbets,30 eow is probably not likely but I will hold on to mine for a while and if it just kind of hovers I will sell CC on it for a while

2021-06-30 16:17:19,wallstreetbets,Make 6 million over a one year period would be my guess.
2021-06-30 01:02:12,wallstreetbets,How do I make money lending my shares
2021-06-29 23:07:16,wallstreetbets,Hope the older accounts are not being paid to pump and dump.

2021-06-30 16:19:04,wallstreetbets,That is not a real counter.

2021-06-29 21:35:04,wallstreetbets,Sorry for your loss
2021-06-29 20:21:11,wallstreetbets,The amount she sold was peanuts vs the amount she still owns. I wouldn‚Äôt be too concerned.
2021-06-29 20:33:20,wallstreetbets,"Because she has a % allocated to it. PLTR went up a ton since she bought, so just making sure it stays at x%"
2021-06-29 20:12:15,wallstreetbets,"I personally trimmed my position in PLTR because that. Not too much profit but profit already, I've been bagholding for months. Finally I got out."
2021-06-30 00:23:51,wallstreetbets,It's based on percentage of portfolio so as it goes up she will sell to rebalance and vice versa
2021-06-29 20:23:45,wallstreetbets,That's very true. That's what makes her move even more confusing to my smooth brain
2021-06-29 20:38:20,wallstreetbets,"IIRC her average was pretty high, like mid 20s."
2021-06-30 01:17:46,wallstreetbets,"Ohhhh, now I get it. That makes sense, thanks!"
2021-06-30 02:51:50,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I don‚Äôt know either. She owns like 23,000,000 shares still so not sure why selling the small amount she did would give her anything.  Maybe she got tired of always buying the shit on a red day and figured fuck it, I‚Äôm selling on a green"
2021-06-30 10:34:39,wallstreetbets,Those kinda jokes don't work when you're actually dumb

2021-06-30 10:54:52,wallstreetbets,When was SOFI a thing? This group is so fucking fragmented. Just focus on one trade‚Ä¶ look what happened to GME we were winning so hard!
2021-06-30 11:22:48,wallstreetbets,"Why is no one asking what their sell order limit was set to on this position? 

Where exactly you expecting this Sub to take you out at OP?"

2021-06-30 05:45:07,wallstreetbets,And I love how they all using robing the hood. You know it's fake when it's robing
2021-06-30 10:53:33,wallstreetbets,This group has become so fragmented - everyone should focus on the same damn trade then we would all win. Really the MODs should be pushing this as they have the greatest influence‚Ä¶

2021-06-30 04:58:53,wallstreetbets,Tbh the constant P&D on WSB is bullish for GME - if they didn't bother we might been in trouble ;-)
2021-06-30 05:03:21,wallstreetbets,Not using Robinhood but why is it a red flag if someone is using it? Genuine question sadly
2021-06-30 11:24:06,wallstreetbets,Not to mention they already have a limit sell order in place‚Ä¶.
2021-06-30 18:57:33,wallstreetbets,What would you say is currently the best play? thats not a pure meme stock
2021-06-29 22:37:33,wallstreetbets,Yup shooting the moon on (SRNE). Mexico has been doing the tango üíÉüèª with their covi stix.
2021-06-29 22:34:01,wallstreetbets,Not to mention he hasn‚Äôt made a single comment in his own thread
2021-06-30 00:11:25,wallstreetbets,I think the yolo post explains perfectly how they get their money lol. Now it‚Äôs just a matter of if they can hold on to it
2021-06-30 00:05:10,wallstreetbets,Most are photoshopped for internet clout. Amazing what people will do for attention even from anonymous people on the interweb. It‚Äôs a psychological thing.

Mans made 228% good for that dude idgi"
2021-06-30 14:00:23,wallstreetbets,"My idea to stop this but more about stopping phantom short selling or whatever it‚Äôs called is for every single share purchase or sale to carry a unique ID code. 


So then OP could say yes it‚Äôs true here is the transaction ID and then it could be publicly looked up.  

I guess that doesn‚Äôt stop someone from just saying they had xyz transaction ID. 


Pretty sure I might be describing an aspect of block chain."
2021-06-30 14:01:05,wallstreetbets,Mods maybe should be asking for video proof of login and purchase. Video much harder to fake than picture for average person.
2021-06-30 15:20:03,wallstreetbets,"Zoom in, every letter and number looks scuffed. It‚Äôs blurry and the top of everything is so clean cut."
2021-06-29 20:15:21,wallstreetbets,So short it???? Fuck you kenny!!! I‚Äôm gonna naked short this bitch!!!

2021-06-29 21:20:39,wallstreetbets,Their rates were shit.
2021-06-29 20:19:20,wallstreetbets,thats something a shill would say
2021-06-30 10:48:47,wallstreetbets,I use Finviz.com
2021-06-29 20:04:57,wallstreetbets,Does Robinhood have a paper trading option?
2021-06-30 01:00:55,wallstreetbets,"Hahah Freudian slip I meant bot. But I've been called a boy on here before. Though the gal isn't gender-based it's my last name, but my avatar is a female so I mean it's pretty dumb when people think I'm a guy too and a bot. If a 10 year old account is a bot then call me impressed it's lasted this long."
2021-06-30 13:30:56,wallstreetbets,Which means they will make bank I guess
2021-06-29 20:20:44,wallstreetbets,"You foul man, we just trying to take care of our folks"
2021-06-30 01:07:48,wallstreetbets,"Ok that makes more sense.  Funny both ways.
I've been called a bot before on other sites.
Mind you my handle was Chembot so I can't blame them I picked that handle before I even knew there are bots. It was a play on science chemical robots
I guess it's just the way things are on these social media posts its pretty easy to be assumed a male especially if you have strong thoughts on an issue"
2021-06-30 00:22:04,wallstreetbets,That's not what he said
2021-06-30 01:09:52,wallstreetbets,"For sure and most of the time people don't pay attention who they're talking to so it happens. It's just lately everyone in WSB is calling people a bot even if the account is older and clearly not a bot, but then other times the ones trying to call you a bot are going about the same bot like habits they're trying to place on you you know like 1 DD post and karma farming comments on a 3 months old account."
2021-06-30 00:54:26,wallstreetbets,I do love me some AMC

2021-06-30 04:04:08,wallstreetbets,"Do you know how a gamma squeeze works? I don't know about this play. I suspect that this whole play depends on volume aka FOMO. The borrow fee rate has been well above 200% and yet since June 18th the only thing that it's been doing is selling off, Trending downward. Then if you look at the borrow rate fee as of yesterday it's at 143%, it went down in one day by a whole 100%. This is not looking to me like anything big is going to happen currently with this stock and the more that borrow fee goes down the less likely it will. You're just not getting enough volume. There is also currently as of today 2mil shares to borrow. shorters usually take stocks like these to pound town starting on thursday all the way to EOD friday, so they can push as many calls out of the money as possible. They're def going to take the hit and pay those borrow fee rates of 140% to keep it off of $20. It's going to be rejecting there super hard. Unless you get some whales to start buying shares and fight back aka volume, it's not going to happen, at least not this week and if people start to sell off again that borrow fee rate is going to drop superfastquick."

They're going to short enough to trigger those and you're right back down to under $20. They're going to especially fight harder tomorrow and friday.

2021-06-29 21:33:15,wallstreetbets,"If you are using Tiger Brokers for active trading, swap over to IBKR. They have same execution quality (because Tiger fills orders through IBKR), lower commissions (at least 50% cheaper), lower margin rates, lower margin requirements and allow you to have more complex options strategies (including taking assignment on your short option positions). Even though you have to pay for market data, you would still pay less because the commissions are that much cheaper. The only downside is their app. The mobile app looks nice but not as nice as Tiger's and their desktop app is pretty old-school and a bit slow.

However, you are mostly holding your stocks instead of actively trading, then you should stick with Tiger because IBKR has an activity fee if you don't generate enough commissions (But if you have 100k, the activity fee is waived). I personally trade a lot so I moved over. Currently paying around half the commissions I used to"

You can laugh at me, I deserve it, but also I seek advice if you can offer it.. wtf should I do here to minimize my losses?

I actually didn't realize I was trading on a margin account.. it was just a normal investing acct before I applied to trade options.

I put in 2k cad and when I made the order for 20 conttacts it quoted me roughly 1k CAD.. I was fine with possibly losing 1k as a learning experience.

I'm now seeing this is a potentially much bigger mistake üòÇ I still don't fully understand what happened.. I made an order that cost more than the amount of cash I had in my margin account? Is that it?

It is usually associated with physical growth delays, mild to moderate intellectual disability, and characteristic facial features. The average IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental ability of an eight- or nine-year-old child, but this can vary widely. The parents of the affected individual are usually genetically normal.

I am considering having two windows open, with trades ready to go for USO puts in one and calls in the other tomorrow in anticipation of the oil report, (market orders so I don't have to fuck with limits on a moving target,) and whatever direction the candle moves in the first second, following that with an executed order. I figure the lag for options IV will buy me some time. I happened to be doing that today with RKT (coincidentally watching the chart as it started to pop, and even with a 10 second lag, I was able to scalp up some 4dte calls quick and make a pretty penny.)

2021-06-30 11:00:53,wallstreetbets,"I'm no expert, but if I had to guess its probably related to how much NVDA is looking at diversifying compared to other chip manufacturing. They're attempting, and seemingly succeeding at becoming far more than just a chip manufacturer. And they're already the second largest in the world at that. Are they overvalued? Probably, for there current assets and profit I'd say yes. But for their potential over the next ten years, I don't think so. Their foray into their simulation software and AI I find the most interesting."

2021-06-29 22:34:38,wallstreetbets,"no they still have loads of debt.  They were basically able to avoid bankruptcy, but they still have several billions in debt they have to pay off at fairly high interest rates.  This is why the CEO is so desperately trying to get people to approve more share offerings, it's the only way the company can stay afloat."
2021-06-29 22:37:38,wallstreetbets,"to clarify, as of now they have 32.5 million short term debt, 2.5 billion in term loans, 2.6 billion in bonds, and 430 million in other debt, their total debt is 5.549 BILLION dollars.  The company is expected to earn -1.5 billion in FY21, -447 million in FY22, and -284 million in FY23, so they really can't pay this debt off unless someone bails them out (apes)."

2021-06-29 21:45:29,wallstreetbets,"The difference between Fisker and Tesla/Nio is that Tesla/Nio didn't require the entirety of their vehicles to be engineered by someone else. Fisker is a decent designer, but how can you invest in an EV company with no engineering? What exactly does investing in Fisker get you? A person who can draw? The world's most renown automotive design house, Pininfarina, has a $80m market cap. Fisker on the other hand is 70x that, at $5b. Fisker is severly overvalued, and has strung investors along for a year with nothing to show.

Why did he and his wife just sell $20m worth of stock?

What IP does Fisker have that makes it worth $6b?

Where is Fisker's solid state batteries that he showed off in CES 2018, but never materialized in anything? He promised 700-mile range, with charging in one-minute.

Why does an automotive company not have any engineering staff?

Why did Fisker give up 6% of their company to Magna, when Magna has never asked this of any of their clients in the past?"
2021-06-29 21:58:40,wallstreetbets,"I treat fisker like I treat AMD.  As you may or may not know, AMD doesn't build their own wafers. They sold glofo about a decade ago. AMD is just a design and r&d. Like IBM became a decade earlier. 

Clearly we can't treat Evs like legacy auto market. 

What you get from fisker is in ideal situation you get to the market in mass asap. It's a stop gap investment that is less speculative. As previously stated it's a discount Tesla/nio in the eyes of investors today. The price of either already has the future locked in. Neither really shouldn't go up in value. Only real factor atm is Biden bucks and inflation increasing the dollar price but not the value.


My thesis is this the poor man late arrival choice. So to me it's not about saying this is better than Tesla /NIO but has potential being a 3rd way. From all the other options I do believe fisker has the best ability. That isn't something I'd hold for a decade though. This will go up in smoke more than likely within 3-4 years. Which might be reincarnated with magna merger. 

Theengineering and solid state are the best bear thesis I've heard. Engineering wise I'd need to confirm. Solid state, hard to say without the engineering situation understood. Because if the engineering statement is true than what did they show and how were they going to develop a battery in the first place? This would be a bear question to expand upon."

2021-06-30 18:51:48,stocks,Sounds like you're ready to ride the wheel.
2021-06-30 19:22:47,stocks,"Why not purchase the shares at current price and sell covered calls? I see what you‚Äôre saying in terms of ‚Äúshort term dip doesnt matter‚Äù but if your long term confidence is that high, just purchase the shares and sell covered calls. Much less interaction needed while initiating a steady stream of income. 

The reason puts are typically cash covered when shorted versus calls that can be covered via long calls/shares is that the risk/benefit just isn‚Äôt there; if the stock price drops both your underlying is worth less (any stocks you own), you have to provide liquidity, and you lost your premium.

Whereas with covered calls, if you get assigned you‚Äôve collected the premium from the calls (which essentially you keep since its independent your shares), and your remaining underlying is worth more than it was when you sold the call. So if you wanted to repurchase the lot of shares you would have offset the cost by two ways."
2021-06-30 18:50:50,stocks,I‚Äôm totally confused .. you mentioned selling covered calls in the headline then referenced selling weekly puts. Lol
2021-06-30 18:51:58,stocks,"Other potential downside is if it absolutely crashes for some reason, you‚Äôll be buying well above what it‚Äôs trading at. Fairly unlikely, not impossible."
2021-06-30 19:36:36,stocks,"Reddit killed my last comment.

Yes, writing naked OTM puts generates income for you while, if assigned, you get the stock cheaper than where it is today.

Note it's technically not the same as writing a covered call, even though the risk exposure is substantially the same."
2021-06-30 19:48:14,stocks,"I think what you've mentioned should work well, the problem would be if the stock drops a lot once you sold your puts or if it rockets up and you miss the train, this shit is always tricky. I honestly prefer to wait for a good entry point (wait maybe for a break-out) instead of selling puts. I have sold puts in a few occasions but basically when I miss my entry. For instance ... I had plan to buy ASTS this morning but it opened with a 30% gap so I was thinking to sold puts (end of July or August) in a way that the strike and premiun match with what I wanted to pay for the stock (in my case around $10). If ASTS goes up I will keep the premium and if it goes down I would be more than happy of beeing assigned.  Hope all this makes sense. Good luck"
2021-06-30 18:56:57,stocks,"I would sell covered calls on the underlying yes. However remember these are companies I am long no matter what, the covered calls would be FAR otm, I wouldn't want them to be assigned"
2021-06-30 18:55:03,stocks,"When shorting outs, the risk exposure is effectively the same as writing a covered call."
2021-06-30 18:57:37,stocks,"Oo shit your right, fuk. Damn wish I could edit title. 

Yes, I meant cash secured puts"
2021-06-30 18:58:39,stocks,But my thing is wouldn't i already be screwed anyways. I was going to buy the stock at current price anyways. This would at least give me the small pittance of premium
2021-06-30 18:58:38,stocks,How so? Writing a covered call is collecting a premium  on XYZ stock that you own. If you get assuaged then kiss that 100 shares good bye‚Ä¶ shorting puts is unlimited risk. Am I missing something?
2021-06-30 19:09:25,stocks,You wouldn't buy at that price if there was terrible earnings or news about the company that you didn't know about beforehand.
2021-06-30 19:12:09,stocks,"I get your point. And I have done this very thing, I‚Äôm a fan. But If you had bought the 100 shares and it tanked, you could at least have had a stop loss preventing you from being totally screwed.  Just adding some more to think about."
2021-06-30 19:32:01,stocks,"Unlimited risk is a misnomer. It‚Äôs 100shares times the strike price of your put minus your premium collected. 

Ex. If you sell a put at a strike of $50 and collect a $2 premium. Your risk in the trade is 100 * $50 = $5000 minus your premium. So $4800 total. You‚Äôll need to have that capital in your account or risk getting margin called. 

After that the stock can zero out (drop to nothing) and sure, that‚Äôs a big loss. 

And to your mention of CCs ‚Ä¶ maybe look up the wheel strategy. You‚Äôre half way there. 

Disclaimer. I‚Äôm new to this myself and welcome corrections if I am in error."
2021-06-30 19:50:09,stocks,A short put is synthetically identical to owning 100 shares and selling a covered call with the same strike.
2021-06-30 19:12:40,stocks,"Ok but the example is either I buy the 100 shares outright today, or I sell cash covered puts until assigned. 

So if there was terrible earnings, id already feel downswing either way"
2021-06-30 19:22:45,stocks,"Oo yeah I'm not a stop loss guy. If I buy i don't plan on selling for a long time no matter what. I've checked and it looks like I could just write them at the money and make about 1% a week until assigned, and when assigned getting a .5% discount. Nothing major but seems like a free percent or two"

2021-06-30 18:24:44,stocks,"Yep, inflation mascarading as earnings."
2021-06-30 18:26:52,stocks,"No, because market is forward looking right.

So, the answer to rising inflation is higher interest rate.

Higher interest rate mean that the debt is now more expensive, the money is no longer cheap. Also future earnings are discounted even more. That would drag down the valuation, and trigger the correction.

Why do you need to raise rates to battle inflation? 

No economy can really thrive in hyperinflation, whole system kinda collapse. So inflation is feared not because of the inflation per see (looking strictly from price perspective) but because the natural answer are higher rates.

Second point, the company that is doing well under inflation is the one who can transfer the cost to the consumer... growth companies that can do that 10y from now usually underperform in inflation environment."

all that matters is NAV/shares outstanding which determines price, price is irrelevant since they'll move with their assets

> And why pay a higher expense ratio if again, the ETF is just going to have the same holdings as a cheaper ETF? Not a huge expense but .03-.06% was the range I saw.

if 2 etfs are exactly the same, go for lower er. this is why people hold voo instead of spy. voo has a lower er but spy has much better liquidity for trading"
2021-06-30 19:52:38,stocks,"Some of that is also just the less expensive shares being smaller portions of the overall pie.

(If you have a DRIP set up, and your position is small, you want the cheaper one so your dividends are less likely to fall below the minimum division threshold for your broker)."

The initial price to implement electric buses would be too high even if it saved money in the long run. Especially since they are run off public money.

2021-06-30 16:25:15,stocks,"It's not pundits that are saying inflation is transitory, its Jerome Powell and other members of the Fed

I agree with you, prices are high right now no denying that. Though IMO that is due to mostly due to disruptions stemming for the pandemic and ""base effects"" as prices recover from the collapse last year

As the economy continue to reopen, I expect the disruptions caused in the supply chain and labor market to lessen, and with saving-laden consumers finally emerging, I dont see higher prices as too much of a negative right now.

To be clear I am not saying inflation is not going on and by transitory it doesn't mean a few weeks or months. Higher Inflation will likely continue for at least the rest of the year. That said, I think it is very unlikely we are at the beginning of a problematic, multi-year inflationary cycle.

Moreover, after the SPY fell 4% in mid-May following panic after the release of the April Consumer Index, stocks have powered ahead despite more, higher than expected readings coming out since then. So I would say it is fair to say fears have tempered as of now"
2021-06-30 16:49:13,stocks,I think it will!
2021-06-30 16:31:18,stocks,"True, but it‚Äôs also in their interest to say that inflation is transitory, no? Otherwise no infrastructure bill, and market euphoria goes away quick. 

I can understand the argument on base effects, but only to an extent. When a drink and a burger at your local bar costs 20% more than last year, is that really a base effect? 

Anyway I‚Äôm not saying that they‚Äôre wrong, just that it seems premature considering as you say, the inflation numbers keep coming in hotter than expected. 

As for your comment on savings, I think people will splurge on travel for sure after so long indoors. In terms of consumables, I am less sure. Are you really going to spend more money just because you‚Äôve saved more over the past year (keep in mind people like my wife also used and abused online shopping). I won‚Äôt, but I‚Äôm also cheap :)"
2021-06-30 16:46:18,stocks,"1. Im confused by what you mean by interests. The Fed has a dual mandate: maintaing inflation stable and maximum employment. Powell has consistently reiterated he sees current inflationary pressures being transitory and will wait for the labor market to imprive before doing any adjustments. Of course he isn't going to come out and say he thinks it's doom and gloom, that makes no sense. Also you know the infrastructure bill is in Congress, the Fed has absolutely nothing to do with that.

2. Food is a bad example to use given it's a staple and price is always volatile. This is why food and energy prices are not included in core inflationary readings. Inflation is measures year-over-year and during this time last year we were in the height of the pandemic and prices collapsed across the board. Now they are rebounding. Using your example (though it's not a very good one for the purpose of inflation) if the price of meat fell 20% last year last year, of course a burger would be worth 20% more comparatively now that it recovered.

3. It is simply a fact Americans today have a very high level of savings due to stimulus. Why would that money not be spent on goods and services? Consumer spending accounts 70% of consumer GDP. Using personal experience doesn't apply to macro trends."
2021-06-30 16:52:54,stocks,"Thanks for the reply.

1. The Fed is supposed to be independent, but in reality I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs oblivious to politics. If inflation is not transitory, the likelihood of passing the infrastructure bill is not as strong.

2. Yeah you‚Äôre right it‚Äôs a bad example. But my point was that some of these price increases are here to stay. A bar likely didn‚Äôt decrease its prices last year, but likely they did increase their prices this year. And it‚Äôs not like they are going to reduce those in the future - they are here to stay. 

3. Fair enough"
2021-06-30 16:55:19,stocks,The Fed has been saying the same thing about inflationw wayyyyyy before the infrastructure bill was proposed. I don't see the connection here.
2021-06-30 17:13:48,stocks,"Didn‚Äôt the transitory comments from the Fed first come in March? Infrastructure proposal has been around for quite a while. I swear I remember seeing some Republicans on TV around that time saying that they were not keen on supporting a big package when inflation was heating up.

Anyway maybe I‚Äôm more skeptical than you, but I do find it hard to believe the Fed is truly impartial to outside influences."
2021-06-30 19:12:24,stocks,"Let's stick to talking about inflation, it was an interesting conversation. I fail to see what the infrastructure bill that has bipartisan support has anything to do with that.

2021-06-30 16:03:06,stocks,"Just because you want to buy for $28 doesn't mean someone is willing to sell it to you for $28. People generally stay away from IPO's because the price volatility gets insane and you don't want to get burned holding shares that you bought based on peer pressure. 

Think of stock investing like an auction. Someone wants to sell 1 share of Apple to a group of 30 buyers. The highest offer they receive is the one they will sell it to. Same with stocks when you break it down to a microscopic level. Your order wasn't filled because someone else either bought them at the price first or no one is selling it for the price you want it for."

2021-06-30 18:14:23,stocks,"IPO volatility on the first day can be crazy depending on supply/demand. 
Demand was much higher than supply so it‚Äôs price skyrocketed past your limit price and since it never went below the buy never executed. 

Volatility ruined your trade."
2021-06-30 18:23:27,stocks,"You may notice in your Limit orders that sometimes, your orders execute partially.

For example, let‚Äôs say stock $XYZ is at $51, and you wanted 100 shares of it at $50. So you place your limit order of 100 @ $50, and you wait until it drops to your price point if it does. Well let‚Äôs say it does, and falls to $50, and you notice that maybe 75/100 shares were bought. Which means it‚Äôs still actively looking for 25 more shares to buy at $50.

This may be because the price of the stock returned to above $50 before your limit order could find enough buyers selling at $50.

For your limit order on the IPO, the $28 limit order was never executed because no one was selling any shares at that price. If you look at most IPO trends though, they have a huge leap in the initial offering for the first few days, but usually fall. So don‚Äôt feel like you missed out on anything, re-enter the position if you believe in the company. If you believe it‚Äôll rise even higher than $36, then buy now."

Just wanted to offer some general advice that i wish I'd known when i started investing years ago. 

Either way, good luck on your investing journey!"

2021-06-30 18:39:34,stocks,As a consumer I think Newegg sucks
2021-06-30 16:43:42,stocks,Can't find any financial info about the company.
2021-06-30 19:40:06,stocks,Newegg is garbage.
2021-06-30 15:38:55,stocks,Wow..watching this
2021-06-30 17:50:33,stocks,Where can i see the average volume of a company?
2021-06-30 19:20:29,stocks,"Interesting, someone needs to start posting that list every sunday."
2021-06-30 19:46:59,stocks,It does. It used to be an Amazing company but now it's junk
2021-06-30 18:48:05,stocks,Weird situation. IIRC they were bought by another company that then changed their name and ticker to reflect Newegg's better brand.
2021-06-30 19:03:49,stocks,"Right.   I think the usual financials shown for the ticker are the ""old"" company.     

Hard to assess without financials, so I'll just watch this again."

2021-06-30 16:51:50,stocks,Thanx! I have never heard of them before but after looking into their Portfolio Analytics tool this is exactly what I was looking for.
2021-06-30 16:53:16,stocks,"Glad to hear that! I am still learning how to use many of their tools, it is really great"
2021-06-30 14:49:04,stocks,Which one of my mutual funds are you running?
2021-06-30 14:56:31,stocks,Also consider that your time frame covers a strong bull market.
2021-06-30 15:10:59,stocks,"There was a study that showed women typically outperform men on stocks, based purely on the fact that they traded less often and tended to hold on to stocks longer."
2021-06-30 15:20:33,stocks,"""Did it go up after I sold it?"" is the wrong question to ask.

The useful question is ""Did the thing I sold go up more after I sold it than the new thing I moved that money into?""

If you bought something better, it was a good sell, even if the old asset continued upward."
2021-06-30 16:25:44,stocks,"The classic struggle.     I break down my decisions on over reacting and under reacting.   Hind sight will tear you up because you never buy at the bottom and never sell at the top.

That's why I hate those articles ""x stock turned $1k into $1 million over the past 6 months""."
2021-06-30 17:37:00,stocks,"My current objective is building wealth, so I only sell for two reasons. 1) I've lost faith in the management, in which case I close the position.  2) I want to take profit to diversify, in which case I sell to get back my original investment and leave the rest until number 1 applies.

I took profit on my weed stock in late January and missed the top in February, but it is lower today than when I sold. But, I'm still holding half of it (for free)."
2021-06-30 18:23:06,stocks,"""None of these were short-term trades, they were all intended to be long-term investments when I bought them but ended up deciding to sell."" This is your biggest problem if they are not suppose to be short term trades then why did you worry about the 50 day moving average? if it's taking and you believe in it just DCA. I know some people have 2 accounts 1 for actively trading and 1 for long term that they don't even open for months at a time, makes it alot easier to hold and not sell something from your long term for a short term play."
2021-06-30 14:33:10,stocks,"As long as ""sell price"" > ""buy price"" there is no bad trade.

Don't focus on what could have been."
2021-06-30 18:45:08,stocks,"You would think all these traders spending hours doing technical analysis would just spend 30 seconds looking up the probability of success rate of trading..

""This statistic deems that over time 80 per cent lose, 10 per cent break even and 10 per cent make money consistently.""

Tldr; don't trade, you'll have better luck playing the slot machine.Market is designed to throw off traders, and not designed to profit ppl who think they ""figured"" it out.

The point at which you decide to ""sell"" is also the point someone decides to ""buy"". In other words, a coin has been flipped at this very instant, and it can go up or down."
2021-06-30 18:03:36,stocks,Good stuff; I don‚Äôt think your screwing up by analyzing your own trends.  That‚Äôs vital and I picked up a few things from you
2021-06-30 19:21:07,stocks,"I had a professor say don't ever check what you've sold, you'll either beat yourself up for it or think you're a genius when you aren't. I still follow that advice"
2021-06-30 19:31:52,stocks,I read the first paragraph and already knew how it ended based on the current market which is near ATHs...

2021-06-30 14:58:21,stocks,The important thing is you have that experience now and can recognize what you need to adjust in your strategy.
2021-06-30 16:04:12,stocks,What about what you put the money into after? And how much more did some of those stocks drop before going back up? Some might‚Äôve dropped a lot and had you panic sell for even less.
2021-06-30 18:21:15,stocks,"If I sell, and I beat the market on that holding in the same time frame, or seen what I was hoping for is usually good enough for me. My biggest goal is to beat the market, anything that beats it is worth it, even if you miss out. 

It definitely does suck, but hey, you can‚Äôt win them all. It definitely helped set me straight on really sticking to the plan."
2021-06-30 18:37:54,stocks,"Ya man. Holding is the way. The cycles make a bigger difference than any short-term analysis we can do, and they take weeks if not months to fully materialize before more cycles affect further."
2021-06-30 19:11:14,stocks,Sold Editas for 37$ fearing market crash and literally couple days later jumped up and is now at 57$. Couldn't believe it.
2021-06-30 19:16:48,stocks, #4. Stop looking everyday.
2021-06-30 15:05:14,stocks,Looking for 10 baggers so no sir im not selling
2021-06-30 18:06:28,stocks,"I try to never sell cuz i hate taxes.  But yes, imagine selling apple or amazon when they had 40% drawdowns. 

I also dont normally trim my winners.  Even if the stock is overvalued, i find it better to let your winners run.  If Im thinking of trimming, im pretty close to selling it all and moving on.  The times ive trimmed i ended up closing my position a few days later.  

I think none of us in this thread have experienced a prolong bear market so our perceptions are skewed.  After the dot com crash amazon and msft were basically flat for more than a decade.  I dont think any of us would have kept on holding."
2021-06-30 18:06:35,stocks,Throws those technical bullshit out as long as the Fed keeps pumping the market.
2021-06-30 19:07:49,stocks,"You can talk about spaghetti lines & all other indicators you want 

But in a nutshell : buy & hold wouldve performed better than staring at the charts"
2021-06-30 15:25:12,stocks,Well in a bull market any selling is premature selling. Not much to learn here sir gas leak.

2021-06-30 14:58:25,stocks,"I appreciate the write up.  The hard part for me is that I've reached the peak of individual stocks I can follow.  Every time I get excited by something new I've got to get rid of something old.    I never look back at that point.

Another problem is I tend to hold on to the ones that are near to a 12-month trade even if I feel like it's a peak.  For example, I wanted to sell ZBH at $175 but I was \~2months away from the long trade tax break."
2021-06-30 17:08:30,stocks,"I honestly don't want to remember all the bad choices I made, but true, selling on small gains or  no gains bites you in the butt over and over again when you go back and check, simple truth is to keep your sanity , don't check lol. I missed out on the Viacom $100 train, sold out in $50s, but now its like I am winner, and a loser at the same time. same with Uber and Lyft, didn't wait long enough. Dumped oil to fast before full recovery, and didn't wait long enough for hotels and malls  to fully bounce back and dropped the glass on Boeing at $130.00. Having patience is great in trading, but God help you if you don't have it."
2021-06-30 17:26:54,stocks,Always sell short term losers to add new names or to winners.
2021-06-30 19:45:51,stocks,"My first investment was SUNW with 1650 shares at 0.25xx, and sold out at low 0.5xxx because ""made profit"" and seen a down trend. The stock then rose to 27.00 the following week."
2021-06-30 18:16:47,stocks,"To a novice fella, I'd tell him: think of a size you would be comfortable with ($1k, $5k, $10k, whichever it is for that stock being watched) and then divide by 3, cause you gonna see it tanking before anything else, most likely.

And spreading out, for buys and sells. If no fortune teller is at hand, there you have a mathematical way of buying the bottom (partially) and selling the peak (partially too). Better to sell expensive a certain amount of something than none for having had it sold too soon, intending to guess the top."
2021-06-30 19:06:31,stocks,"For me, it ends up being that the things you understand will be the best stock for you to hold. Especially considering these reddit stocks. I stopped worrying if something I was recommended to buy was now overvalued or not, and now only own stocks I understand because my reason for holding isn't is number gonna go up or down. Sure you have some lost opportunities, I sold APPN at 10% gain at fucking 55$ cus I didn't want to keep checking the number; but alot of the random single digit stocks ended up being bad investments if i didn't know better. 

Also one last thing, I would sell before I expected a dip and ended up regretting it but maybe that was just a me fault"
2021-06-30 19:21:30,stocks,"Re: #1 - Yes. Stocks entering sideways trading periods or slow declines will generally retest the 50 day MA. I've noticed a similar pattern can be applied to 200 day MA, but that's highly dependent on broader market volatility."
2021-06-30 19:23:31,stocks,I think those sells were not entirely wrong. TA could really be a good indicator of entry/exit. What could've made them better is you should've bought them back afterward instead of buying other stocks.
2021-06-30 19:33:13,stocks,Remember what Buffet said about the stock market and transferring money from the impatient to the patient.
2021-06-30 15:15:50,stocks,"LOL, keep in mind I didn't include anything about the profitability of these trades.  Only that I could have held for higher prices."
2021-06-30 15:17:14,stocks,"Yes, which is why I did comment on stocks being in longer-term uptrends.  In a bear market this won't be the case.  But by the time we're in a bear market you've missed your opportunity to sell anyway."
2021-06-30 19:46:43,stocks,"He's also half assing a strategy. Buy to invest but make trade based sales? Do one or the other not both. As a trader I've missed plenty of runups, but I don't care because overall I've outperformed all but the meme stocks by just swapping between stuff and taking profits in this volatile bull market. In fact my biggest ""losses""(opportunity cost) were doing exactly what OP did, where I bought and held for 6 months thinking I was an investor in this market but really wanted to be a trader instead. Either invest and hold through volatility, or trade and profit off volatility."
2021-06-30 17:39:21,stocks,A bull market being pumped with unprecedented liquidity.  Stocks go up because nobody has anywhere else to put their money.
2021-06-30 17:50:42,stocks,Fidelity had this study that said that the best performing retail investors were those that are dead and the second best performing are those who forgot their password

2021-06-30 17:40:16,stocks,"That's 'cus men like tweaking our portfolios, we have fun with it, women just wanna invest and be done with it.

Probably generalizing here, sorry."
2021-06-30 19:10:10,stocks,"Does this stand in reverse too? If I sell at a loss, and move the money to a new position that's also losing but not as hard as the original asset, I am winning right ? RIGHT ?"
2021-06-30 15:02:31,stocks,There is still benefit to finding better strategies to become more efficient. Why would you accept minimal efficiency with no effort to improve?
2021-06-30 15:27:43,stocks,He‚Äôs not at all wtf he is learning from his mistakes and was nice enough to share this experience with us and his assessment of his decisions
2021-06-30 16:04:49,stocks,"This is horrible advice and is 6th grade logic not rooted in any fundamentals of finance.

The best investors are obsessed with the concept of opportunity cost."
2021-06-30 15:14:48,stocks,"That's very wrong.  If you're a trader and your system is to accumulate small wins, that's a perfectly fine philosophy.  But for long term investors it makes no sense.  Selling investments for 30% returns when I could have almost always held for bigger profits is bad investing."
2021-06-30 15:12:08,stocks,Keeping a journal of all your decisions is a great way to learn.
2021-06-30 17:10:42,stocks,Hi you find a  lead or You have a hint at a x10 let me know buddy.

2021-06-30 15:25:24,stocks,"I've been investing as a professional, running money for myself, high net worth individuals, hedge funds, pension funds, etc. for just under 35 years.

2021-06-30 19:50:04,stocks,"That's what I love about options. It forces you to think like a trader. For me that helps keep me from getting ""married"" to a position."

I sold some AMD calls for $1.60. That was double what I bought for. You know what they‚Äôre at today? $4. Idgaf though.

If you fixate on ‚Äúwhat could have been‚Äù when it comes to missed gains you‚Äôre going to get to a very dark place very quickly.

Profit is profit. Be happy with your sell order of you made money."
2021-06-30 15:51:11,stocks,"21 sell in 12-18 months is definitely not a ""long term investment""

2021-06-30 19:42:59,stocks,"I use the metric quite a lot and like you mentioned it's a de facto metric used in valuation. I agree EBITDA doesn't capture balance sheet quality & Capex, but the fundamental value of a company is based on the value of future free cash flows adjusted for time & risk. With that being said, the EV/EBITDA multiple used should capture that. 

For example holding everything constant using a company with high Capex needs with $100m in EBITDA will trade at a lower multiple compared to another company with low Capex needs with $100m in EBITDA."

2021-06-30 14:00:44,stocks,I think you should take some gains. Good job.
2021-06-30 14:03:58,stocks,Do you need money now? Can you use that money somewhere else with better returns? If the answer is yes then sell or trim a little.
2021-06-30 15:20:34,stocks,"When I get massive gains in one stock what I typically do is sell enough to recover my initial investment and then leave the rest in the stock.  This basically makes the shares left over as free and you can reinvest the original amount in a better opportunity.  A win win.

For example if I bought 10 shares of stock A for $10 a share and now the stock is $15. I would sell around 7 shares get $105 and leave 3 shares as basically free stock."
2021-06-30 14:13:54,stocks,"If it was me I'd sell. The market is looking very shaky at the moment and lots of people posting research that suggests a crash is coming. That crash will wipe out your gains and put you in the red. Do your own research of course, it's your own money  just remain vigilant."
2021-06-30 14:20:40,stocks,"I'd sell half. Even if the wider market dips, airlines are still depressed so might not suffer as much/even grow. Or not. maybe business travelers realize they don't need to go in person and air travel never fully recovers. Sell half, research and think about a good place to ride out a broader storm for the rest. And put a little into something fun #yolo"

If you do not need money, I would not recommend SELL. If you believe in the companies, they will keep going up. Also I am not a financial advisor but I will never put money into Airlines. They rarely made money (before COVID) and there is no way on earth that travel will go back to normal for a long time. Especially Business (where most of airlines made the money)"

2021-06-30 14:37:29,stocks,"My question is what does sofi do better than anyone else that makes them a real competitor in any space they are in, diversification isn't everything if you can't be on top in at least one of the areas you are in. On top of that SOFI is priced as a tech company however when I read about it it just seems like a startup bank, and this is a problem because banks don't grow as fast as tech companies and aren't priced as such, we saw what happens when a non tech company is priced like one in WeWork and SOFI seems very similar, the question is how much longer can they get away with a ""tech"" valuation."
2021-06-30 13:27:02,stocks,"Jack of all trades, Master of none. Everything they do I am already doing through other parties. None of their offerings are any better than the credit union, insurer, brokerage, ie the companies or services I've already sought out and selected.

2021-06-30 14:41:48,stocks,"I haven't done a ton of research on them, but their selling point seems to be that they are an all in one financial app. Banking, loans, insurance, trading....all together. 

Personally, I already have all those things, but they are spread over 3-4 companies/apps. All those apps work together pretty well.....I can easily add money from my bank to my brokerage account already, without fees or time lag. Maybe it's a bit easier if everything I have is SoFi, but not enough so I'm inclined to change all these things in and join SoFi. 

Also, it seems like their big appeal is being the first to do this, but it seems like square and PayPal both might have eyes on this concept. I know square just applied for a bank charter, and PayPal talked about some coming changes this fall (I believe it was in their last conference call if you want to look it up). I think both these companies could crush SoFi if they were do inclined and have much larger existing user bases. 

That said, I have SoFi on my watch list as something interesting when the hype dies down."
2021-06-30 13:20:03,stocks,"You kind of already answered it - their multiple. SOFI is already priced to perfection, assuming their growth continues for years to come while improving their margins. Hedge funds are betting that increased competition will limit Sofi‚Äôs market share and therefore would not justify its current valuation ~$17 billion. 

There is also a large short position related to upcoming lock-up expirations which is just a quick short term play. Will be interesting to see what the short interest looks like after that."
2021-06-30 14:40:20,stocks,"Getting caught up in the WSB hype kinda makes it look like an iffy company short term no matter how much it runs, and it‚Äôll probably keep serious investors away. 

Bear case, I‚Äôm thinking after the meme hype around it dies down in the next month or so, the volume drops significantly, and their new customer base drops a good bit, stock probably falls to sub $15 and stays there until late this year or early next year.

I don‚Äôt hold a position currently but I‚Äôm bullish on them long term, 3+ years."

I'm very bullish but also long in terms of when I see this stock rising, most likely 2-3 years and finish off at a nice little $35-40 price w/ some dividends in the future hopefully lol"

It‚Äôs the whole ecosystem and comprehensive tech driven infrastructure that they have established and who they target as customers  (yes the millennials who want a one stop shop for all financing needs and it all started with a student loan) to bring in massive growth without the brick and mortar capital requirements. I‚Äôm in my late 30s and I could see how my nieces and nephews would use Sofi when they get older. I myself have been banking with BoA and hate everything about the traditional banking system. I literally use a different third party platform for every other financial need like mortgage, credit cards, insurance, investing, retirement, etc. I could see how Sofi is capitalizing on the digital financing demand from the millennials who prefer efficiency over some minor differences in offering quality which btw Sofi will be constantly improving."

The idea is that once that does click brand loyalty will be established and switching costs will be high and people will stay where they are.

Maybe, but it's not compelling enough. I have my checking at BOA, my mortgage at Wells Fargo, my brokerage at fidelity, my credit card at Citi. I have no desire to switch/simplify. 

I think the key for SOFI is getting people to start there with the checking account then lure them in to everything else. That first bank you start with is sticky.

Fintechs haven't been ""the same product"".  Fintechs have typically identified what customer want, and how to make those functions seamless.  Banks haven't.  This was starkly admitted by JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon just two weeks ago when he candidly admitted that they couldn't do what Square and the others did because they lack the creative impetus."

>This user agreement is a contract between you and PayPal, Inc. governing your use of your Venmo account and the Venmo services. You must be in the United States and have a U.S. bank account to use the Venmo services.

The UI when you sign up is just mimicking what your iPhone does when you update the operating system or get a new phone. Sync up your contacts and agree to various options so PayPal can get more data from you. And then once you‚Äôre set up it kind of looks like a barebones 2008 Facebook. Same color scheme."

If its user figures slide expect even greater pushback by artists for higher fees as spotify loses its ""must be on"" platform power"
2021-06-30 13:23:28,stocks,Definitely a long-term hold. They‚Äôve invested a lot into their podcast business recently so hopefully see some returns from that in the next couple of years. If they can figure out targeted ads on podcasts that‚Äôll change the game.

2021-06-30 18:08:52,stocks,"Tbf musicians made very little off money their records before streaming. It's just that streaming is reducing it further. They always made most of their money doing live shows and merch. Like one commentator said, live events are oversaturated, Venues, promoters, labels are all trying to be the middle man. Spotify needs to put band merch into their app. Sell shirts and CD and little trinkets as Spotify exclusives. But honestly they suffer from the Uber effect where it's almost impossible to gain profitability. They can cut out all revenue to artist and they will go SoundCloud, and even if they do cut revenue to artist and artists stay on Spotify, they still won't make a profit. Their business model is flawed if they don't expand out of streaming they will continually make losses"

Not saying in anyway Spotify will become amazon of x btw, it's just an easy comparison.

To answer your other question, for starters, podcasts. They've invested huge amounts of money into them. Audiobooks as well. And that's just the start.

Anyway, clearly you are bearish on them and that's fine. To each their own, but I'm pretty comfortable with them over the next 5+ years."
2021-06-30 18:47:45,stocks,"They aren't going to make a ton of money off merch, but it will have a higher profit margin than whatever they have rn. Audiobooks and Podcasts are in the same vein as music streaming the margins are slim to none even if they don't share revenue. If they increase the price of their subscription, people will just go to SoundCloud or piracy. There is no path to profitability with Spotify if they don't look outside of what they are doing. Their biggest bane of their existence is SoundCloud and piracy. 

But agree to disagree, I don't think that they will collapse or anything but I see them as a perpetual loss making company until they either change their business model or they get acquired by a bigger media conglomerate like Warner Brothers or Netflix or more likely Disney. And either get absorbed or delisted This is my opinion"

2021-06-30 00:00:00,stocks,"Looking to a pullback & beyond   

Been reading recently of how many Redditers are advocating for another pullback/recession given the amount of money sloshing around the economy or the various deadly Covid variations making the rounds of other countries or some combination of both. Some Redditers, even though rather aggressive have a lot of good points.  Not saying they are wrong, but it would seem time to take prudent steps to get your portfolio in order and shake loose some money.

Unfortunately all of them seem to be firmly glued to extremes - either sell everything now and sit on cash or keep money in the market until the very last second and then pull it all out of the market in the nick of time (never worked for me). I am working a different angle that is a longer game.

What both approaches above share is buy once then forget until panicked selling. Admittedly it uses less time lurching into buying and then lunging into selling than my method. 

I buy dividend stocks so that I can watch my money grow with or without a recession. Not saying never participated in the occasional rocket:  jail stock, health stock or  gaming stock. Just went in for a quick profit on the meme's and was out. Quick & clean. But the dividend stocks are treated differently.

After doing DD, I closely monitor these stocks for their price movement after I buy them. When I initially buy it is a small amount - \~ 40% of what I ultimately want to own. I keep this as a core position then trade in the stock - buying when it has a pull back and selling when the trading position goes higher. My ultimate goal is to own these dividend stocks at a average cost of less than $3-$5/share in less than 3 years.

Using this method, I own a good handful of stocks at less than $3/share which makes just about any crash meaningless to these stocks in my portfolio. So far have used this method on ¬º of the  stocks in portfolio. Stocks have done this to include: 

AES - avg. cost $3.57 \[did have a cost basis of zero, then a buying opp occurred\] - Currently selling for $26.25

CVA - avg. cost $.46 \[ yeah that is correct 46 cents\] Currently selling for $17.47.

CC - avg cost $8.75 \[still working on this one\] Currently selling for $34.64.

CWEN - avg cost $10.46 \[still working on this one\] Currently selling for $26.67.

HEES - avg. cost $13.20 \[still working on this one\] Currently selling for $33.24.

HASI - avg. cost $.74 Currently selling for $56.73.

HTGC - avg. cost $6.33 \[still working on this one\] Currently selling for $17.01

IIPR - avg cost $24.62 \[afraid that is about as good as this will get\] Currently selling for $193.55.

RF - avg cost $1.21 Currently selling for $20.08.

SPTN - avg. cost $.124 Currently selling for $18.79

SKT - $7.57 \[ still working on this one. Bought stock 4 months before became a momentary meme stock. Thanks Redditers for making this a meme stock one time\] Currently selling for $18.79.

The bulk of my portfolio are made up of stocks like MAIN, FE, ET, ETRN, IRM, etc that were bought at decent to good prices and am looking for a correction/recession to add to them. With the stocks I have gotten down in price recently - CVA, CC, RF, SPTN I have a pretty good head start on cash that has been freed up to indulge the other dividend stocks I own and get their cost down.

There is just something, to me, about having a stock that has a YOC of 190% (HASI) \[$.74 (stock price)/by $1.40 (yearly dividend)\] that makes me smile at night when I go to sleep."

My man, you still lost money if the stock goes to $26.24. If you‚Äôre holding onto a stock because you think it‚Äôs impossible to go below your cost basis, you‚Äôre in for some trouble. You should be buying and selling based on the future not the past."

No, you missed the point; sorry I was not more clear.  As an investor one does not have to be either all in or all out, like many of the doom & gloomers about the upcoming economic calamity proclaim from their soapboxes.  There are nuances. 

One only can lose money when you sell a stock.  If you hold it is a paper loss.  My argument is that I am in stocks for the long haul, preservation of principle is important (keeping profit is good but not as important as principle), and ones money has to be in the market to work long term benefits.  To do that, in my mind, need to aggressively get the price of shares down thereby freeing up cash for other stock buys.  In this case as a fund for buying depressed shares in a correction/recession.  Second to hang on to those original stocks through corrections/recessions to get more cheap shares through DRIP's."

2021-06-30 12:18:19,stocks,"Yea, the high of the stock was definitely at 697, not around 900..."
2021-06-30 13:10:26,stocks,"You're not taking into account that Tesla will expand into far more different revenue streams once they get things into shape. I think Tesla being the most valuable company in the next decade is a real possibility. Look at where every country is trying to get to... EV's. It's a revolutionary product that is still in its very early stages. This isn't your traditional auto company. If you're comparing Tesla to GM, Ford, etc., just because they both sell vehicles, you're already in the wrong discussion."
2021-06-30 13:02:39,stocks,Which reality? Your I guess
2021-06-30 10:59:33,stocks,"Lol, what? Deliveries matter because it shows demand. Tesla is a tech AND car company."
2021-06-30 12:56:45,stocks,"I hate this argument. What ""tech"" is anyone buying from TSLA? The same as Toyota, Honda, GM, Ford, and every other car company. The ability to get from point A to B. It is a car company. Take away the car and what do you get?"
2021-06-30 12:38:34,stocks,"A tech company that sells you tech for $50,000 and gives you the car as a freebie?"
2021-06-30 12:08:54,stocks,"Let test this awesome logic.  Tomorrow Elon announces that Tesla will ceases to sell cars and shutting down all of its operations because it‚Äôs a tech company. 

What‚Äôs going to happen?  Such dumb logic."
2021-06-30 12:51:39,stocks,Not sure. The last quarter's report  was on 4th April and the earlier one on 2nd January
2021-06-30 16:15:11,stocks,I heard probably on the 1st or 2nd so still this week
2021-06-30 11:29:58,stocks,"Actually it shows supply.

Deliveries is a metric for Tesla‚Äôs execution as a manufacturer, not one that shows whether customers want the product or not. They sell them all."
2021-06-30 11:05:33,stocks,It shows the demand for their cars now. But I think they will have more revenue in 10 years from licensing their software and design features than they will from selling their own cars.
2021-06-30 13:40:21,stocks,They‚Äôre not now but they will. The software that is in Tesla‚Äôs vehicles is nothing like what anyone else has.
2021-06-30 12:11:04,stocks,"Yeah, growing EV deliveries doesn't show demand. Genius statement. Where do some of ya'll learn to invest from?"
2021-06-30 11:08:18,stocks,That doesn't change the fact that Tesla's delivery numbers at this stage of their business is very important and will continue to be. That's like saying Apple's iPhones aren't going to be as important as their services segment in the future. They go hand-in-hand.
2021-06-30 15:41:20,stocks,‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not now but they will be.‚Äù Ok so your saying Tesla is not a tech company currently?
2021-06-30 12:22:08,stocks,"No, growing EV deliveries from tesla shows how many they could make and deliver because they have always sold them all. It‚Äôs a metric of their execution not the market. 

I just paid cash for my third tesla, and all three are from investing. 

I named this one after you for the day.

How are you doing?

Come at me sideways with snarky comments? Yes I‚Äôm petty af."
2021-06-30 15:43:07,stocks,Its good to be objective about stocks. However its bad to be emotional about them. You seem like the ladder and probably shouldnt be investing if you get this emotional about a stock.
2021-06-30 12:45:17,stocks,"How many they can make is already disclosed. Deliveries show units sold. They aren't mutually exclusive just because Tesla sells the majority of the vehicles they produce. You don't make any sense.

Are you seriously bragging about a Tesla vehicle as if it's impressive? I bought a $635,000 condo in NYC four years ago that is worth about $850,000 in the open market. You think you're some hotshot because you bought a Tesla? Lol, way to get triggered."
2021-06-30 12:47:16,stocks,"Oh homie, those purchases were tipping the dealer, not the extent.

You should spend time in large scale supply chain management and manufacturing."

2021-06-30 12:51:36,stocks,"When you aren't emotionally invested into a discussion to the point where you think bragging about your Tesla vehicle improves your argument, come talk to me. You're literally talking about baby money here with your vehicle but you felt so compelled to brag about it."
2021-06-30 14:27:47,stocks,You are both cringe losers. Bragging about gains on an online anonymous internet forum.
2021-06-30 12:52:29,stocks,"No, you came at me sideways with snarky comments and I returned the favor in kind.

I was polite af until you crossed the line.

Go read homie."
2021-06-30 12:56:08,stocks,"""It's actually supply.""

No, it's demand. Just because Tesla sells about as many vehicles as they produce doesn't mean you change the definition. You tried to think you're more 'intelligent' than you really are. 

Next, you brag about your Tesla vehicle. The gains alone from my condo the past four years could buy every single Tesla vehicle you own.   


You're focused on the wrong things, 'homie.'"
2021-06-30 12:59:35,stocks,"You‚Äôve gone from being the instigator introducing snarky comments at me, to asking for a civil conversation, to going right back to trying to make snarky comments.

They even state it in their s-1 filings that they‚Äôre afraid they might not be able to sustain for longer period if they don‚Äôt see a good amount of growth in paying customers, which right not they‚Äôre having hard time converting from non-paying customers"
2021-06-30 00:00:00,stocks,"AMD vs NVDA, which one are you guys favoring right now? I‚Äôve noticed that recently these two stocks becoming more popular discussion points, with NVDA having a 4 to 1 split in mid July and AMD‚Äôs projected growth. I‚Äôm curious to know which of the two you guying are liking better and what your points are for your favored stock?"
2021-06-30 10:15:07,stocks,The correct answer is both with a bit of TSM on the side.
2021-06-30 11:46:03,stocks,I‚Äôm very bullish for NVDA; might trim my exposure after the split tho
2021-06-30 10:36:05,stocks,"Both. I'm serious. AMD will have a few great months, then NVDA will, then AMD will. They really aren't volatile, they just hang out and wait for their turn."
2021-06-30 14:53:18,stocks,"I couldn‚Äôt decide 5 years ago so I bought both and boy did it work out for me lol.

That being said AMD valuation short term looks better but long term NVDA will be an absolute beast. So will AMD but I think NVDA will be a top 5 market cap company one day."
2021-06-30 15:49:10,stocks,I like how intel is out of the question
2021-06-30 09:30:20,stocks,Both are great but I think NVDA has rising significantly recently where as AMD is starting its rise with a plethora of good news
2021-06-30 09:54:02,stocks,Just buy both
2021-06-30 11:45:44,stocks,50/50. I truly don't believe anyone can reliably predict which one will outperform the other. That knowledge depends on far too many unknown variables at this time.
2021-06-30 14:16:44,stocks,"NVDAs going to 1 trillion on the back of their data center GPUs. 

AMDs going to continue growing as their GPU market increases. 

So the answer is both."
2021-06-30 10:15:40,stocks,"NVDA and AMD are always chomping at the bit trying to get ahead of the other. As such, there‚Äôs always a great ebb and flow between the two. When one pushes ahead, the other lacks behind. If you go long on both, look at who‚Äôs currently doing better. Roll more into the other. AMD was crushing it last year then intel dropped the 10th and subsequently, 11th gen processors and pulled ahead again. My portfolio more heavily favored Intel and I came out ahead. Now its the opposite. Their back and forth has done me well for the last 6-7 years."
2021-06-30 16:19:14,stocks,"nvidia had its run. doesn't mean its not gonna keep going but thats gonna be the harder trade imo

but when amd closes the xilinx deal...watch out"
2021-06-30 18:03:06,stocks,Just added 700 more AMD shares
2021-06-30 16:16:12,stocks,I'm bullish on the entire semiconductor industry for at least the next 5 years. I see no reason to choose one over the other.
2021-06-30 17:21:47,stocks,I like AMD because a lot of intel‚Äôs market share is up for grabs. Both seem like good buys tho.
2021-06-30 17:22:58,stocks,"I just went in harder on AMD. 

I‚Äôve always loved the stock. I remember when I heard about them making waves back when you could buy the stock at $5-6. I regret not going heavy in them almost as much as me missing Tesla.

They have a good product, a nice clientele list, and good leadership. They will be the all the better in the days to come."
2021-06-30 14:36:29,stocks,"I have all four, NVDA, AMD, TSM and Intel. Number of shares in that order. Own both NVDA and AMD for over 5 years so well vested and plan to hold them for long. 

TSM and Intel are strategic, both are building new plants in AZ which will add to supply chain. With mgmt change at Intc it is possible that it goes heavy in fab business and grow while it may loose market share to amd and nVDA it may increase revenue from fab business. Of course since no one knows what future holds, I am hedging my bets on all four."
2021-06-30 16:20:22,stocks,I think both are fantastic but AMD has more room to run. Especially given where it is in relation to its ATH.
2021-06-30 16:28:56,stocks,AMD is more fairly valued than NVDA
2021-06-30 10:30:05,stocks,"NVDA. They have so many good things going for them but they are going big in the server space finally.

And the [pending acquisition ](https://jesbaek.com/2021/01/06/the-arm-powered-revolution-and-why-you-should-invest-in-it/) of ARM could change the game entirely."
2021-06-30 11:09:02,stocks,buy NVDA for the AI
2021-06-30 16:05:19,stocks,"Got NVDA at $215 in November 2017. When it hit $400, I thought it was overpriced. I still this stock is way overpriced but glad I am still in."
2021-06-30 12:34:34,stocks,AMD is in the middle of its typical rally pre-earnings so that's probably my fave!
2021-06-30 11:25:49,stocks,"I believe NVDA is the overall better company, AMD may have the more attractive entry point though."
2021-06-30 09:30:26,stocks,AMD as it has more room to grow.
2021-06-30 09:50:07,stocks,Both or Soxx
2021-06-30 12:43:25,stocks,Own both. Nvda has been on a crazy run.
2021-06-30 13:57:09,stocks,Buy a little of both alongside TSMC.  Semiconductors aren't going anywhere soon.
2021-06-30 14:54:55,stocks,INTC cries in the corner
2021-06-30 15:08:02,stocks,"There‚Äôs room for both and both are good invests.  Short term NVDA will out pace AMD but mid term AMD has serious room to run.

Both are fantastic long plays"
2021-06-30 10:40:57,stocks,I would buy both together with TSMC. But I think AMD is more valuable still they have a lot of room to grow and I hope for crypto to turn away from this hardcore mining and this will fuck more with Nvidia than AMD. I don't think that will stop Nvidia from going other ways for growth though.
2021-06-30 11:18:01,stocks,just read the replies on the other 10 threads that have recently asked the same question
2021-06-30 11:35:09,stocks,Why not both?
2021-06-30 12:23:50,stocks,"I'm liking AMD's growth, even with Nvidia's coming split, was more affordable.  Nvidia does have a dividend, but not enough to make me want to leap.  Watching $KLIC"
2021-06-30 13:24:36,stocks,"Both are good but AMD was much quicker to increase their retail price for GPUs that are in high demand.  I believe that will realize a nice jump in profits.

I prefer Nvidia cards but looking at it from an investors POV, I'm not sure why their RTX 3080 still has an MSRP at $700 yet AMD's are priced much closer to market value."
2021-06-30 14:07:47,stocks,NVDA seem to be an AI play on self driving and data center. AMD is expected to take Intel marketshare. I think it all depends on which narrative you prefer. I am not invested in any of the chip stocks for now. But if I have to I will invest in TSM who seem to be catalyst for all big chip producers.
2021-06-30 14:15:01,stocks,"I bought both back at the beginning of March (same day) and from the price I purchased:

Nvidia is up \~63%  
AMD is up \~25%

I regret nothing, both are great companies. If I had to only choose one, for the long term, it would be Nvidia.

FYI: I will never buy Intel stock. They screw the pooch way too often."
2021-06-30 14:17:53,stocks,"Long-ish term, AMD. They‚Äôre about to supplant Intel in the server/enterprise hardware market. 

Short-ish, NVDA. Their acquisition of Mellanox is a big deal for GPU+Nic compute nodes, and if they manage to win the court challenges to their attempted acquisition of ARM they‚Äôll be a juggernaut. However, I find it highly unlikely that they‚Äôll win considering the enormous opposition."
2021-06-30 14:19:51,stocks,YES!
2021-06-30 14:51:59,stocks,"I own AMD but always been interested in Nvidia. Kind of wished I had bought them over Disney.

I just been wondering what price to try to wait for since it's flown so much lately."
2021-06-30 15:36:50,stocks,Nvda
2021-06-30 15:38:38,stocks,Hedge and buy both. That‚Äôs what I did a few years ago and I‚Äôve enjoyed the gains since.
2021-06-30 16:57:42,stocks,"NVDA and AMD are two of my largest holdings comprising over 25% of my portfolio. Slightly more NVDA than AMD right now just because it's been doing stupid things pre-split. AMD's last couple days might mean it'll catch up soon though.

I finally dumped INTC yesterday after way too long."
2021-06-30 17:07:31,stocks,"My semi basket is tsm, nvda, amd, asml, lrcx, klac, and mu"
2021-06-30 17:52:17,stocks,"I would say AMD due to the current market cap and quality of products being released.

Nvidia if the stock drops 20-30% would make it worth it. Current valuation is too high, I think next earnings report will bring the stock down to a more fair value."
2021-06-30 18:31:03,stocks,"NVDA 500bn market cap, almost 20bn annual revenue.

AMD 120bn market cap, 10bn annual revenue.

NVDA eps is 5x better, but I like AMD growth prospect.

From a technical standpoint, $100 break should really send AMD. NVDA otoh should pull back after the split July 19."
2021-06-30 19:10:46,stocks,AMD - They are clearly making big moves for the future right now to be a huge competitor. Lots going on. I believe in their current leadership. I think Nvidia is too complacent.
2021-06-30 11:26:00,stocks,AMD and it is not even close
2021-06-30 10:47:51,stocks,"I am on AMD camp.

2021-06-30 17:04:19,stocks,"AMD as they already blew intel out of the water and now have their sights on gpu's.  

Nvidia has been king shit for ages so competition will do them good. I think the 6000 series really caught up to Nvidia on the gaming side (not so much on the high end for editing and rendering). One more generation and they could fully catch up/get ahead in some areas.  

I like both but I think Nvidia needs something innovative to get me to want to invest more than I have. Still a great option though."

2021-06-30 15:34:00,stocks,"The problem is that ~~AMD underdog fanboys~~ people see them as very similar companies and, as such, AMD is the clear choice because it‚Äôs cheaper and will get to Nvidia‚Äôs level at some point in the future.

This is very wrong. Nvidia is so far ahead of the game in so many key growth sectors: AI, cloud, edge, 5G, autonomous driving (both the SoC and the ML training hardware and the software stack), robotics, metaverse, and of course gaming. And never mind their focus on ARM to usurp the x86 duopoly (and not just them; every large tech company is making custom ARM CPUs). And most of these are powered by their incredibly strong moat with CUDA and their entire platform with multiple SDKs. They are used by so many companies in so many fields, many of which are very nascent and with plenty of room to grow (e.g., they make no money today on AV).

Where is AMD in any of these sectors? They‚Äôve yet to make a dent on any AI field in any substantial way. There‚Äôs no AV focus. Software is garbage.

AMD is a chip company. Nvidia is a platform company."

2021-06-30 15:08:31,stocks,"AMD for the short term (now - 1 year).  NVDA for the long term (foreseeable future - years).  NVDA has so much patented technology and many plans that have yet to be released.  With the ARM acquisition looking more positive, those synergies will provide an upside to earnings potential - particularly in the area of data center computing.

For now, AMD continues to eat INTC‚Äôs lunch and will continue to do so for the next 2 - 4 years.  Why not invest in both (AMD & NVDA)?"

Within the next year or so, I would then move into both AMD and NVDA as the upcoming increased capacity (particularly at the sub 10nm process node) means AMD and NVDA both will have enough supply to sell as many chips as their customers want.  

Then both AMD and NVDA can proceed to finish murdering Intel's chip design arm in the data center."

2021-06-30 14:55:36,stocks,"Team RED all the way.

The Zen 5 will blow away any intel based system, and more companies like EVGA are now offering products to work with AMD where prior it was Intel only. Also on the GPU side they are going to be beating NVIDIA on sales and performance. I would not be surprised if AMD hits 118 in 3 months. My last report on them 2 weeks ago had a Price target of 89, they blew through that and market sentiment will push it even further. They are undervalued by a good bit now."
2021-06-30 16:40:38,stocks,"Personally, even with the stock split, I favor NVDA. Even with projected growth they still in my opinion AMD will not stay as viable as it is and will lose ground in the Processor Arena to Intel as has been the trend.

AMD will likely overtake at some point in the future as they move to multi core and make Nvidia the next intel. But that's not happening tomorrow and by the time it does Nvidia will have grown anyway.

2021-06-30 19:48:54,stocks,"They're down right now, but somewhat longer-term play, 3-5 years I really like INTC. I bought some while they're cheap. To answer the original question I bought more AMD than Intel though. I haven't touched NVDA yet. This most recent breakout has definitely put them out of reach for me. Over half a trillion dollar market cap. Another 100% gain over the next 3-5 years brings them to a 1 trillion cap company. They would have to be really killing it in all areas with no set backs to justify that. 100% return would be incredible (20-33% return per year) but again that's best case scenario in my mind. On the other hand, Intel could double in market cap, 100% return in that time span, and be around 450 billion (smaller than NVDA is today). That's more probable to me. Obviously, a more normal 7-12% gain is more likely on either.  If you asked the question 3 months ago you would probably get a different answer, but based off today's valuation, that's my 2 cents. Now, AMD, I'm loaded up there because they're gaining market share in CPUs, GPUs, and servers and the smallest market cap. Biggest room to grow and that's partially what investing is about - future growth. I have to credit my wife for catching AMD earlier. $9-13 a share in 2017 and loaded up more on this recent dip in the 70s. I realize NVDA is also expanding in other tech areas and not just chips, but until there's a more quantifiable dollar out to those endeavors and other big tech doesn't come out ahead as the leader then it's hard to bank on those other areas of R&D. All just my opinion"

2021-06-30 17:54:03,stocks,AMD is as fundamentally sound as NVDA at a cheaper multiple.

2021-06-30 12:59:26,stocks,"Idk, I entirely get what you‚Äôre saying and would agree that this is somewhat true for any company; but while AMD is becoming increasingly competitive, the disparity within the game development scene is still apparent, or atleast it was when I left the industry just before the pandemic. 

Firstly, while AMD is unquestionably good, the Nvidia products still outperform AMD‚Äôs implementation on many features, including but not limited to, Ray-tracing, which is something that‚Äôs been spoken about in the games industry at length with next generation consoles.

Now the logical conclusion is ‚Äòbetter performing GPUs=more capability for developers= their card of choice for development‚Äô- this thought process is entirely justifiable, however, it is also completely wrong. A lot of GPU choice in big development companies, and sometimes smaller ones, is related to ‚Äòdevrel‚Äô (developer relations)- in bigger companies, GPU manufacturers will approach the developers and offer to pay to have their GPU as the primary one- ever seen the opening cinematic to a game and it comes up with NVidia/whichever manufacturers logo? Now of course that company didn‚Äôt develop the game, but they did provide the processor under the impression the game would then be associated with it. 

Nvidia are far more influential in this respect, even when I was working for a smaller studio with one relatively successful game, Nvidia contacted management and provided them with top of the range GPU‚Äôs for free, as long as the studio heads agreed to have their game primarily associated with Nvidia, and be featured in their ‚ÄòGame ready‚Äô drivers on the GeForce App. 

Essentially, Nvidia is a Titan, AMD is an Olympic God. Both extremely powerful, and on paper, Nvidia takes the edge; but the Titans were killed by the Olympic Gods, so it‚Äôs not a dead cert, but I‚Äôd bet on Nvidia"
2021-06-30 13:46:25,stocks,"> NVDA and AMD are always chomping at the bit trying to get ahead of the other.

This is somewhat true. But they could also both go up by taking market share from Intel."
2021-06-30 16:54:03,stocks,AMD and NVDA only compete in the fringes. Consumer GPUs are a small market for AMD. NVDA and AMD are complementary in CPU+GPU in consumer/server/HPC market.

2021-06-30 19:56:56,stocks,"People act like NVDA is the only player in the AI game though. All big tech companies are actively developing their own AI tech. I'm not discrediting NVDAs GPU advantage, their commitment to AI, and their new server announcement. I just think banking on them being the lead in AI is similar to people banking on TSLA being the leader on autonomous vehicles and other tech. The development is there, but there's no guarantees they'll be the leader in 5-10 years. 5-10 years is what longer term investors care about."
2021-06-30 13:53:09,stocks,Not the most clear-cut answer for this nuanced topic.  For example Nvidia is carving out its own sector while AMD is eating up the x86 space.
2021-06-30 14:13:32,stocks,"Into what? Just saying ""more room to grow"" doesn't mean much. For example I could point out that Nvidia has it's hand in and is considered the best in many more sectors. Maybe it has less ""room to grow"" in those, but added up the perspective changes.

x86's future is also uncertain right now with the rise of ARM in traditionally x86 dominated sectors. ARM which Nvidia is trying to buy coincidentally. There's a real possibility that AMD and Intel find themselves in a ""adapt or die"" scenario in a a decade or less."

Equipment sourcing/installing for R+D is slow, drawn out, and uncompromising experience, taking years instead of months. They also work poorly with smaller suppliers, expecting people to meet them at their level of bureaucracy, which, again, is slow/hard for smaller suppliers to do.

So any bombastic announcements from them will be sales pitch based, as developing new products/techniques is a long long iterative process for them, which isn‚Äôt working now tick/tock is out the window, and 7/10nm failures are still ongoing (FA busy as ever, with even more high priority dies), and only salvaged samples are having a price slapped on them to recoup some costs."

They own smartstorage which is getting adoption.

With the acquisiton Xilinx/AMD will own the data-center with a one-stop solution for networking, storage, bespoke accelerators, x86 or GPUs.

AMD has a lower market cap so in principle for it to double requires less of a relative increase in market share than Nvidia. 

I'm not saying either is any better than the other, personally I have Amd but nvidia has been railing the sp500 so I cant really diss it."
2021-06-30 12:20:54,stocks,That's ok. You don't have to buy the full stock. 10 dollars or whatever currency you have will get you started.

2021-06-30 15:07:29,stocks,"Negative ghostrider.  I've been watching them both like a hawk since end of 2020.  They both have been OOS everywhere and the ONLY way to get either is by winning the Best Buy notification race or use auto-buying bots.  Actually, the opposite is true due to AMD being quicker to re-price causing them to sell out a bit slower.

People paying top dollar for autobuying bots for Nvidia 3080s.  More so than AMD.  This is due to Nvidia's gaming and ETH mining performance AND their super low MSRP of $600-700.  Comparable AMD starts at $1k.  And I believe that will translate into more profit per unit for AMD.  Could be wrong tho."
2021-06-30 18:40:42,stocks,I had the wrong data. Thanks for the correction.
2021-06-30 19:56:12,stocks,"I guess my comment was more directed towards the general sentiment I‚Äôm seeing in this thread and others where people say ‚ÄúAMD has more room to grow‚Äù because they both make GPUs and that‚Äôs all there is to it.

AMD is already a >$100B market cap company and I don‚Äôt see what their strategy is to grow significantly beyond that in the long run, never mind Nvidia‚Äôs (admittedly expensive) level today. For instance, they recently acquired Xilinx, an FPGA company. Do FPGAs make a lot of money? Are FPGAs deployed in data centers and used in AI training/inference today? No. Could that change? Maybe, but the last decade of Intel‚Äôs Altera acquisition and the lack of FPGA solutions in the ML space shows otherwise. Never mind the programming nightmare that they are.

Having said all that, I think in the short term AMD could still grow from the momentum of their CPU and gaming business, but they need to demonstrate some alternative markets/revenue streams to justify any real comparison to Nvidia. I do hold some AMD for this reason and would recommend some AMD exposure for this reason, but Nvidia is still my dream FAA**N**G company."

2021-06-30 14:31:32,stocks,"A lot of people do! It‚Äôs a logical thought process, albeit logic isn‚Äôt always ‚Äòright‚Äô. 

https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/what-does-it-mean-when-a-game-has-amd-or-nvidia-branding/

This article does a somewhat adequate job of explaining it (if you shift through the irrelevant tech breakdown content that‚Äôs painted as a fact, but is actually highly situational)

there‚Äôs a line toward the end that does say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôve seen AMD branded games that ended up running better on Nvidia GPUs, or Nvidia promoted games that end up performing better on AMD GPUs‚Äô- this is so amazingly accurate, it made me laugh. 

Here‚Äôs one of Nvidias options as a developer looking to work with them, so you can get a rough statement from the horses mouth- 

https://developer.nvidia.com/indie-spotlight

Note how it specifically refers to ‚ÄòGeForce marketing channels‚Äô- just because a game doesn‚Äôt come up in your GeForce supported section, or doesn‚Äôt have its own reference in a game ready driver, doesn‚Äôt mean your GPU won‚Äôt run it! 

That link is about applying for partnership, but they do also reach out to successful games, as I‚Äôm sure AMD do too, but my personal experience is limited to Nvidia. Of course it‚Äôs highly unlikely that one will take you on if their competitor already has, they want the guise of exclusivity, rather than cooperation

Also in the brief searching I‚Äôve just been doing, giving credit where it‚Äôs due AMD seem to have made significant progress regarding devrel since I left the field, but Nvidia still takes the cake on that one. 

Either way, whoever you invest in, they‚Äôre not going to fade into insignificance- personally I‚Äôd be just as happy to work with either of them"
2021-06-30 14:38:30,stocks,"True, but Nvidia make over half their revenue on GPUs and considering the ‚ÄòNvidia or AMD‚Äô I focused on their most overlapping products, if they‚Äôd said ‚ÄòAMD or Intel‚Äô I would‚Äôve focused on microchips and CPUs. 

It‚Äôs very clear in what I‚Äôve written that I‚Äôm referring to which outperforms which in accordance to the comment I was replying to, and in relation to sectors that overlap, not sure why you‚Äôd draw the comparison between the two companies for things that don‚Äôt.

Edit- forgot to mention that the ‚Äòover half their revenue‚Äô being made from GPUs isn‚Äôt specific to gaming ones, GPUs are used for loads of reasons, the underlying compsci behind them is the same. Just different variations to perform different tasks more efficiently, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if a significant amount of those GPUs weren‚Äôt commercial sales, but corporate

Edit 2- a colleague I discussed this with pointed out that GPU‚Äôs probably make up about 80% of their revenue, considering the majority of their work in AI and data centre fields, is also providing GPUs."

See Intel's purchase of Altera for $15 billion back in 2015, revenue has been basically flat (some of this maybe has to do with Intel).

Xilinx has also had quite a bit of lumpiness in their revenue growth in recent years - but incredibly profitable nonetheless (70% GM). Will def. be accretive to AMD's financials."
2021-06-30 15:43:26,stocks,"Gotcha.  I consider availability and volume to be completely different things although I can see how the terms may overlap slightly.

The MSRP jump is like 100%.  With volume comes more costs to produce (albeit descending per unit - but still more overall).  But with just double MSRP there are no inherent costs, just pure profit.

But I honestly don't know what the volume numbers are here and if they are ridiculous enough then I would have to agree with you."

2021-06-30 14:41:07,stocks,Don‚Äôt know enough about it personally to say something; however i would note that Nvidia is disabling crypto mining capability for some of their processors- there‚Äôs enough demand for them outside of crypto to keep going

I even specified in the first paragraph that I was talking about the disparity between them in game development. It‚Äôs literally the only reason to put the two companies together. 

comparing their other industries, such as Nvidias AI, and AMD‚Äôs CPUs is like asking for a comparison between McDonald‚Äôs and The Ivy, both foods but vastly different worlds, the knowledge required to make an educated guess as to the developments AMD will make in CPU‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt equate to the knowledge required to asses whether that will have a stronger return than Nvidias branching into AI, they‚Äôre fundamentally different markets.

I use them right now but they keep on sectioning off different stocks to higher paying members, which is annoying) that one can use in relation to investing, whether that's as an individual retail investor, or working with a particular fund of sorts.

Main things that I'm looking for:

1) Relatively low trading/commission fees or membership costs

2) A platform that has many, as well as a wide variety of ETFs, and US and UK listed stocks and shares. These shares would ideally be well organised and categorised as well, or the platform would at least enable users to make their own categories and lists on the app/website

3) Reputable and reliable. This platform doesn't attempt to pull fast ones on heavily traded stocks, and it also protects its investors via different regulations, insurance policies etc

4) Something where it's relatively quick and simple to liquidate funds

Any help would be sweet, thanks."
2021-06-30 11:25:30,stocks,"When looking for platforms in the UK, keep your eyes peeled and avoid CFDs. Companies like eToro and trading212 will quietly sell you a CFD instead of the actual asset when you buy on margin.

If you want a legit and above board company, Hargreaves Landsdown, IG, or Fidelity International and good choices, but come with high fees. Consider these companies if you're trading with large sums. 

App based platforms like Freetrade and Revolut are 'free' apps similar to RobinHood in the US, however, payment for order flow isn't legal in the UK. These apps get paid through alternative means such as pay-walling popular stocks or charging regular fees. They are regulated in the UK as e-money, meaning your money is kept separate from business accounts and is ring fenced in the event of administration. They are good for fun money, but not large sums."
2021-06-30 18:10:37,stocks,"212 aren't accepting new customers just now. Not to mention they're under fire for share lending. Though it's up to you if you care about that. They do however have a free ISA (with no lending) so may be worth an account with just for that if you're prepared to wait. 

I'm not sure how much you have to invest but Freetrade premium is actually free if you leave at least ¬£4K in your account and also includes an ISA too. Freetrade don't lend either. 

There is also the option of IBKR directly if you have the funds. A portfolio over ¬£20000 has a minimum monthly fee of ¬£10. So the same as Freetrade. But any commission you pay is deducted from that monthly fee. Their fixed commission option includes all fees including FX and isn't much more than the FX fees alone you're already paying Freetrade anyway. However, they don't offer an ISA and I'm unsure exactly where they stand with share lending. 

I'm currently with Freetrade and awaiting 212 for their ISA. Freetrade aren't perfect but at least they want customers have have pretty good customer service I'm my experience. The down side is for a full service they aren't actually free and ¬£10 a month for a service that doesn't even come with PC charting software is actually very expensive. They also have a maximum order size for US stocks of ¬£25000 which is a joke but they are currently reviewing this and will be increasing it at some point."

2021-06-30 09:37:45,stocks,"They do, but Walmart isn‚Äôt the price leader anymore. Their advantage in scale is balanced by their large overheads. The average size of a Walmart store is 182,000 sq ft. (Sorry too lazy to do metric conversion).  We have what are referred to as ‚Äúdollar stores‚Äù that cater to the poorest shoppers and have taken these shoppers from Walmart. The most popular would be Dollar General. Look at their store growth and stock chart. They cater to the poorest shoppers by doing things like offering smaller sizes. The unit cost may be higher but if you‚Äôre living paycheck to paycheck you can‚Äôt afford 64oz of laundry detergent, you want to buy 12oz to get you through the week. Their stores are small, no frills, low overhead and they outcompete Walmart. They only sell non-perishable food though so a discount grocer like Aldi that sells perishable food should still have room to benefit as inflation pushes more shoppers down market from traditional grocery stores into discount stores.

Recent evidence suggests there's more food inflation to come.

When this year's grain harvest begins in May, world grain stocks will be down to 59 days of consumption -- the lowest level in 30 years, EPI noted.

Those stores are very efficient, they offer fewer product selection, they don‚Äôt stock items individually they fill shelves with the boxes items ship in, you bag your own groceries, you buy bags or bring your own, you deposit quarters to get your shopping cart so that you return it yourself to get your quarters back. Very lean operations = low prices."
2021-06-30 13:55:29,stocks,"Dollar Generals are kind of their own unique category though. They are basically where there aren't grocery stores, and while dollar stores mostly sell non consumables like plates, party supplies, toys, along with soda, candy and canned goods. Dollar Generals sell full sized cereal boxes, frozen food, some dairy products, pet food and even beer."
2021-06-30 11:29:02,stocks,There is only ten cents of wheat in a loaf of bread and the plastic bag that contains your tortilla chips costs more than the corn. Grain prices are high due to the storms last summer in the Midwest plus the drought in Brazil.Meat prices however are high due to the cutbacks in production last year and the high cost of feed. The price for soybean meal is over $400 per ton and it is usually half that.
2021-06-30 10:17:59,stocks,"I‚Äôm not a huge fan as I look deeper. Declining sales, rising operating expenses, increasing debt, turnover in the C-suite, and their own 2021 outlook is a 5-7% decrease in revenue‚Ä¶ I might just put this on my watch list and see if it gets down into the $15-$16 range so the dividend yield is over 5%."

2021-06-30 13:04:34,stocks,Just to be clear KR is massive and owns food 4 less and pay-less supermarkets
2021-06-30 14:08:12,stocks,My hometown has four DG‚Äôs. The longest drive to the nearest grocery store from one is five minutes. Two of them are in the shadow of a grocery store. I have also seen plenty of what you‚Äôre talking about though where they are located in areas that lack a grocery store and people would have to drive maybe 20 minutes to the nearest one.
2021-06-30 12:10:55,stocks,So what you‚Äôre saying is food prices are going up‚Ä¶
2021-06-30 10:25:41,stocks,I just had a quick look at the business and a 8.58 PE ration with a 4.2% dividend puts it on the watch list. They operate in the traditional grocer space which I think will struggle to compete with discount grocers and Walmart in an inflationary environment but on the face of it those financials looked compelling.
2021-06-30 13:14:33,stocks,"Appreciate the insight, I didn‚Äôt know that much about KR and think of them only as Kroger branded grocery stores."
2021-06-30 15:12:53,stocks,"I like DG. Their business model generates a ton of cash and new stores typically become cash flow positive in a year. Outside of any down price grocery trends, I like the stock."
2021-06-30 10:49:41,stocks,"For SPTN as well as BGS, have to look at the results before March 2020 to get a feel for their real fundamentals.  March 2020 and going forward were great years for both.  People stayed home in droves and foresook restaurants. Now both companies have to return to their pre-Covid numbers.  Not saying they won't take off again if another variant of Covid hits.

Their current divies, etc are not bad but should wait for a pullback."
2021-06-30 13:19:04,stocks,"I started looking at KR after buffets bought it. It's extremely interesting. P/S 0.22 with massive operating cashflow. If you include curbside, they're in the top 10 largest e-commerce companies by revenue. They have a lot of brands and are spread out geographically."

2021-06-30 00:00:00,stocks,"What is going on with Cigna (CI) I've bought and sold and bought CI at a loss and am continuing to watch.  The company profile is decent, growth prospects are good and it's trading at a low P/E.  Research shows good growth prospects and there's a small dividend for the stock.  But I watch it continue to take a downward trajectory.  Analysts give it a green light.  It seems to defy all the publicly available research.

A little more DD: EVA, Thompson Reuters, Jefferson and McClean all rate it a buy or conservative stock.  I don't think I've seen every one of these reports align like this before.  The only one is Trading Central noting a short term decline and long term Bullish.

UNLESS there is something else going on that nobody is publicly relaying or I have missed this seems primed to explode to the upside.  Does anyone know if there are struggles within this company that I can't find?  This stock doesn't make sense to me.

Discosure: I currently own the stock and re-bought back in about 1% loss ago after pulling out of a 5% loss previously and watching it go down further.  Thought I found a good re-entry.  Maybe not.

Might update if there's a 5% move either way."

2021-06-30 09:31:04,stocks,"As you said its conservative equity, revenues grow mid single digit so inline with GDP and its already up a lot this year. So nothing is going on, it already did very well. Not sure what are you expecting."

2021-06-30 15:54:05,stocks,"I guess because those others are trading at a P/E around 20 with a forward of 20 and CI is sitting at 13 with a forward of 10.  Maybe I‚Äôm relying on P/E too heavily.  However, from a valuation point of view (earnings per share) CI is in line with both HUM and UNH.  It just looks under valued and I can‚Äôt figure it out.

I was just scrolling the sub and noticed a handful of people talking shit on technical analysis, it doesn‚Äôt work, it has never been proven to work, etc..

I want all you TA bashers to know that you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. 

There are some aspects of TA that I deem utterly useless like ‚Äúhead and shoulders‚Äù or ‚Äúcup and handle‚Äù. 

As far as the basics go, like channel trading, support and resistances, rsi indicator, these things are incredibly accurate if you have a solid game plan of entries, exits, and stop losses.

I have a watchlist of about 150 stocks that I believe are fundamentally solid that I have been trading in and out of for years. Made almost 400% last year and i‚Äôm up over 100% this year even though my trading has drastically slowed.

For those of you that think TA is just squiggly lines on a chalkboard, you are very wrong. I have roughly 3 years worth of proof  and so do many others that know how to use it correctly and manage their risk exposure."

2021-06-30 14:12:27,stocks,"I've also had negative sentiment towards my TA but doesn't matter. 

People who invest are usually taught by Ben Graham, Buffet and the likes. They all say they same thing about TA. Sadly they are wrong just because they don't understand it. 


But don't allow it to get you down. I've been investing based on TA and very little FA very successfully (both stocks and forex), I even teach a good bunch of traders. If it works for you, great... but don't even bother convincing others. Do you and you'll be very far."

2021-06-30 07:37:04,stocks,Do you have any recommendations for beginners using TA? I just ordered Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets: A Comprehensive Guide to Trading Methods and Applications by John Murphy. Been reading some entry level books on trading as well. I think I Have a good framework for options but I don‚Äôt entirely understand the greeks. Im more of a bullish investor but Im strongly convinced we‚Äôre heading into bear territory and I need to make a strategy accordingly.
2021-06-30 12:21:15,stocks,"Personally, I don‚Äôt really care about TA because I buy for the long term (5+ years). My reasoning is mainly that if I‚Äôm trying to squeeze out $0.01s of an ‚Äúundervalued‚Äù company, then I am probably being overly optimistic/ confident. 

I think TA is something that can be useful for more short term investors (0 mos. - 1 year) however."

2021-06-30 08:46:46,stocks,I started with a lot more than 10k but you‚Äôre 100% correct. A larger amount of capital is much harder to manage.
2021-06-30 07:44:08,stocks,"Yea, you‚Äôre saying the exact same thing everyone else says. Like word for word. 

The market has without a doubt been on easy mode for anyone going long but anyone going long around feb of this year has gotten smoked as far as mid caps are concerned. You‚Äôre not taking into account that people can trade off TA when the market is tanking. Many people like myself went short on U, fubo, TSLA, etc., and made a good chunk of change. All from TA. 

I never looked at job reports, economic data, inflation, etc.. Just the chart, volume, dark pool activity, and option flow."
2021-06-30 08:42:24,stocks,"I don‚Äôt really have any recommendations man. I got lucky and was taught by someone that is just incredible at it. 

There are a handful of people on Twitter that are great at charting. You can add them and look at the charts they post just so you get familiar with what clean charts look like. Maybe even track their trades and figure out when their charts were successful and when they failed.

Of course I would never recommend you follow any of their trades. Just learn from them."

2021-06-30 17:20:22,stocks,"Psychedelic medicine is overdue for another breakout. All of the recent scientific studies, regulatory action and mass media coverage have been incredibly positive. Compass Pathways recently completed the world's largest study on psychedelics (22 sites, 10 countries, 216 participants. Phase 2B psilocybin for treatment resistant depression) and will report results before the end of the year. California's psych decrim bill just passed assembly yesterday and could become law by September.

The amount of scientific and anecdotal evidence that certain psychedelics have incredibly beneficial therapeutic potential is overwhelming. People who claim there's no profit to be had don't know what they're talking about. Ketamine clinics are generating significant revenue now and will be able to administer MDMA and Psilocybin therapy as FDA trials complete (MAPS' MDMA for PTSD is in 2nd round of phase 3 trials demonstrating astounding efficicacy) and local regulations loosen in places like Oregon, where all drugs have been decriminalized.

This industry is being slept on massively. I ended 5 years of poly drug abuse with a single psilocybin trip. I did a complete 180 and have been sober for over a decade. Makes it easy to hold these stocks when you believe as strongly in this medicine as I do.

These substances have been used across cultures and continents for millennia. The science is now confirming what some already know. When used in a proper set and setting, psychedelic medicine can be an incredible catalyst for personal change, especially when paired with specific psychotherapy protocols."

2021-06-30 17:13:40,stocks,"As a whole industry, absolutely. But coming from someone who's been in this industry for well over a decade, it's really hard to determine which publicly traded cybersecurity companies will not only stay afloat but thrive. New companies form in this industry all the effing time. I'd see it every year at RSA Conference in San Francisco. Some will grow into large companies, even public ones; others will see growth but get acquired by large corp, and others will see growth then fizzle out. The kicker: you don't know who it will be.

Let's take Crowdstrike, for example. Their protection capabilities are nothing stellar. To be honest, I can think of a few other vendors I would pick first before deploying their stack. But they're crushing it with their numbers, but not in a good way. I have current coworkers who worked there and former coworkers who currently work there, and they over-work their sales team to the bone, Wolf of Wall Street style. They have an insanely good LTV:CAC ratio, which means not only do they find new business, they renew a ton of that same business each year. But what happens when a lot of the sales staff are tired of constantly rising quota's without increase in pay? What happens when new hires get fed one thing and then experience another? What happens when multiple competitors, who already provide better protection, scale their sales teams? If we go by how good the products and services are, Crowdstrike is not one to invest long term in.

If I was confident in a company in this industry, believe me, I'd already be investing in them, I'm privy to a lot more info in this industry than most. But there isn't a single publicly traded cybersecurity company that I'd vouch for. All the ones that I would vouch for are all private. Perhaps if Crowdstrike starts to acquire the best technology from the hottest cybersecurity start-ups, I'd invest then, but until that happens, I'm staying away. And look, I'm not a short term trader, when I buy, I hold. I personally think CRWD is way too overvalued and I think that over the next couple years, customers will see that their security stack is not as good as some competitors (if they don't acquire new technology, of course).

And SentinelOne. They don't even generate $100 mil in revenue yet they have an $11 bil market cap??? Are you fucking kidding me? The private security company I work for does a quarter billion yet if we had the same 110 P/S ratio, we'd be worth $27 billion, and my options would be worth well over a million bucks. And that's not even considering their security stack. They don't offer sandboxing for analysis (pretty big), they're prone to false positives (per contacts of mine), reports of quality issues due to rapid releases, and a minor issue that customers have to deploy updates in batches of 50 at a time. So I don't get why people even deploy that fucking company, man. We beat them out on deals all the time."

Same with AR (I don't believe in VR, too closed-in), maybe that will pop a bit sooner. I can see Apple pulling an AR play in 2027 but if they released something next year, it would probably disappoint. This technology still has to mature.

My personal favorite bet that's in a similar category is lab-grown meat, I see that being the norm 30 years from now.

Isn't this a really big deal? It's all everyone talks about at companies that are trying to become profitable or even sustainable at all. If you're existing customers are coming back in their droves you've basically hit the jackpot.

>But what happens when a lot of the sales staff are tired of constantly rising quota's without increase in pay

Isn't that why salespeople are paid a base salary and then commission based on every sale they make? The more they sell the more money they make. Hard to get tired of that."
2021-06-30 13:22:28,stocks,IMO I would go with ETFs. cyber companies are targets so one of them getting hacked is bad news if that‚Äôs the only stock you have exposure too. Solar winds was a great example of this.
2021-06-30 14:44:16,stocks,"Fed‚Äôs Going Zero Trust.

The Federal government has a new mandate to move to zero-trust security for its agencies and any companies with which it conducts business.

**Cloudflare**‚Äôs CEO Matthew Prince, speaking at the JP Morgan conference last week, said: ‚Äú\_the Biden administration's executive order saying that if you're doing business with the federal government, you have to adopt a zero trust approach to security. And reading it was like reading the Cloudflare product catalog...And I think that, that will very quickly start to get people to say, the old approach of just buying a whole bunch of boxes and sticking them in an IT closet somewhere, that doesn't work anymore because here's a document that says it doesn't.\_‚Äù

And, **Okta**‚Äôs CEO Todd McKinnon had this to say on the company‚Äôs earnings call last week: ‚Äú\_I was meeting with the Chief Security Officer at a very well-known 3-letter agency....And basically, what they were saying is it sounded like -- and literally, a marketing script that Okta would say. They said we were a victim of SolarWinds. They're worried about these other attacks, these exchange leaks, these exchange attacks -- these exchange attacks, etc. We have to go to Zero Trust, and identity is at the core of it all.\_‚Äù

2021-06-30 15:09:30,stocks,For me the key is to get in early where companies haven't started production. There is a risk that you end with a company which burns before creating any kind of review but you do some research and hope for best. I am up 30% in last 6 months on Lithium stocks

2021-06-30 17:38:58,stocks,"EA is going to be a monster in the coming years (although it already is).

Continuos revenue stream through Apex Legends (and growing YOY), FIFA generates a stupid amount of money, Ultimate Team especially (all of its variants generated  $1.49bn just in FY 2020) and growing YOY. 

The new Battlefield game is launching later this year, the expectations around it are unreal and, although there are no pre order data yet, just based off general hype and the gamer-groups I know, it may very well be the best selling BF game (and also it seems EA plans to give it the Apex treatment, making it a live service game with at least a 5 year life cycle, which means another great constant revenue stream for them).

Rumours on DICE (an EA studio) starting development on Battlefront 3 (a Star Wars multiplayer game similar to battlefield) and Respawn (creators of Apex) working on the sequel for Jedi Fallen order (the first game sold 10M copies in the first 4 months).

Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, but this is one of the easiest bets on a gaming stock rn."
2021-06-30 10:28:33,stocks,"Facebook is winning vr and ar lol, Apple stands no chance. They're years ahead and have probably 10x the r&d budget of apple for it. Apple is possibly releasing something next year but they have been majorly tempering expectations. Prolly cause it sucks.

Facebooks technology is mature, I was running around in skyrim earlier today and casting spells. They started including hands control. They are also committed to a/r, and are going to solve the closed off issue your talking about. If you read fbooks r&d numbers, acquisitions, and Zuckerbergs leaked emails from 2016 its clear they will not be beat in the space with competitors being as laid back as they are on it"
2021-06-30 09:11:43,stocks,Oh yea this is just the preview for what‚Äôs to come. And they know it which is why they‚Äôre so aggressive dominate the AI arena. It‚Äôs like an arms race.

2021-06-30 09:36:17,stocks,Not at all. I‚Äôve been in the space for 6-7 years now. M&A is starting to pick up and the big US players who can‚Äôt uplist yet are starting to give guidance of 1b dollar run rates. Saturation is far from a worry imo

2021-06-30 09:48:29,stocks,Luv me some SQ. They are a little overweight in my portfolio because I technically double dip with ARKK. But I'm ok with the exposure since I believe in that company.
2021-06-30 12:47:24,stocks,Just read an earning call from any of the uranium producers like CCJ. They are basically brokering uranium instead of mining their own because there won‚Äôt be enough demand necessitating mining for several years. Optimistic about the future down the line though
2021-06-30 15:33:30,stocks,"I mean, that makes a lot of sense, but definitely isn't in my >10k ""just for fun"" type of investing.

2021-06-30 10:49:50,stocks,"I respectfully disagree.  No one is growing alcohol in their back yard.  Well, you get my point.   Cannabis has a deeply established black market.  Anyone can brew beer in their garage.  At the end of a month of boiling, fermentation and bottling you have shitty beer which probably cost you more to make per bottle than the price of grocery store beer.   Pot has effectively no entry cost.  There are other barriers to grow your own but $$ isn‚Äôt one of them.   Commercial pot producers must pay for land lease, farming equip, R&D, packaging, and transport to retailers.  IMHO there‚Äôs a HUGE future for pot consumption but little future for pot stocks as producers can barely pay their overhead and make a profit."
2021-06-30 12:06:53,stocks,"I don‚Äôt consume so honestly no I haven‚Äôt noticed and I can count on 1 hand how many times in the past 3 years I‚Äôve been inside a gas station lol But non the less you can‚Äôt say that budlight hasn‚Äôt absolutely dominated that field for years. I see what you‚Äôre saying though, everyone is going to have competition. Cannabis is going to be a hard  one for it. Don‚Äôt change my mind though that it‚Äôs not going to preform in the future."
2021-06-30 18:06:27,stocks,Yea but it‚Äôs expensive
2021-06-30 11:27:03,stocks,"If you hold them for short periods you have expanded downside risk, and for long term holds you are at a mathematical disadvantage due to both high expense ratios, and the fact that it's a leverage of % change (so if what the leveraged fund is tracking goes down 10% one day, then returns 11.1% the next day to net 0 over the two days, the leveraged version went down 30% then up 33.3%, which is net -6.666%)

People hone in on the second because in effect you are leveraged to a higher multiple for negative moves (sort of), but if you still expect a strong sector performance leveraged ETFs can still be good holds provided you're comfortable with the risks."
2021-06-30 11:21:45,stocks,Just add risk from my understanding and mayb a little higher fee.
2021-06-30 14:32:28,stocks,"The key thing to remember about leveraged funds is that they are designed to be day trading products, not long term investments. They only aim to replicate a single day's performance, and as such there are situations (i.e. volatile growth) where the underlying stock(s) can trend up, but the leveraged fund doesn't match its growth, trades sideways, or even goes down. 

Generally speaking, if you're not very familiar and comfortable with the underlying mechanisms of how these funds work and achieve leverage, and what can cause their long term rise or fall, they probably shouldn't be in your portfolio."

They run wireless vr, and have touch control.  If quest 2 was released by Apple or Microsoft people would be all over themselves claiming it wad the future.

They are also much more focused as a company on winning vr than anyone else. Probably spend more than all other companies combined on it"

I suppose the major difference is Facebook acquired oculus to be their AR/VR. Microsoft and Apple have the cash on hand to do the same. I think the playing field will level out in the coming years. But to each their own!


Edit: [Companies like Facebook and Magic Leap have XR headsets, and they have platforms that are relatively mature at this point. Still, they do not have the security and cloud infrastructure to truly compete with what Microsoft has built.](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2021/04/06/why-microsoft-won-the-22-billion-army-hololens-2-ar-deal/amp/) I think the military made the right choice in AR do you?"

What positions?"
2021-06-30 11:52:06,stocks,"Fb acquired oculus in 2014. Thats how long they've been in the area, and integrated with the company. They have purchased no less than 15 additional companies for vr, and have more cash on hand that can be dedicated to vr than apple or Microsoft.

Can you see Microsoft putting 1/5th of its workforce on vr/ar? I cant, and fb is just so far ahead and so committed. You can't just quick whip up a vr either, users will literally vomit if done wrong

Just saw your edit. Military will have no choice to switch over when fb is light years ahead. They could run simulations today on quest modeled after live combat. Fully wireless. Microsoft can't touch that."

2021-06-30 05:44:42,stocks,"When you sell a covered call it will show up as a negative position. So it would be like -1 contracts for example. 

You can‚Äôt force the owner of the call you sold to exercise when you want, but you can close your covered call trade but then buying the same option you sold to close. So if you sold a call for ABC co on july 21, you‚Äôd sell to open, and collect the option premium. If you decide to sell you shares you‚Äôd still have the liability of the call option you sold, meaning you still owe ABC at the strike price on July 21 if it were in the money. 

To end you liability you‚Äôd find the same option you sold to open, but instead on the order ticket you‚Äôd select buy to close. Which would replace the option you sold and you‚Äôd be free to move on. The owner may or may not exercise the option whenever. It‚Äôs rare it happens before the exercise date though."
2021-06-30 06:57:03,stocks,You have to buy to close the contract you sold first. I recommend you set the strike price higher to a price you are comfortable lossing your shares. Less premium but also less risk.
2021-06-30 06:02:59,stocks,So it's almost not worth it because if it runs in the money then that call would cost more money then right?
2021-06-30 07:01:36,stocks,And only sell them on big up days
2021-06-30 06:39:00,stocks,"Well yeah if your strike is 55 and the stock is trading at 60 you‚Äôre 5 dollars in the money, meaning you‚Äôre right to buy at 55 is giving immediate value of 5 a share, you know? That would make the options worth probably 5 per share minimum, plus the other factors which price options like time/volatility. 

Covered calls are great if your goals are aligned. What‚Äôs worth it or not is each investors opinion. So I can‚Äôt say. 

What I‚Äôll say in my opinion is covered calls are a great strategy for a high yielding portfolio if your goal is to yield 6-10 percent in a lower risk type way. You won‚Äôt be  owning many multibaggers this way but you can yield solid. By selling covered calls on dividend paying stocks at slightly higher strikes than you own you can guarantee either yield, or capital gains. If ABC pays 4 percent, and you periodically sell covered calls, and collect the option premium, you‚Äôll get to collect the premium and dividend, and if the yield is 4 percent, you can collect 4 percent in option premium, which would be a yield of 8 percent. If the shares get called away and sold at the strike, by choosing a strike that‚Äôs a bit slightly higher you may get called but maybe at a 6 percent gain, which can be redeployed into more similar stocks. The key is finding good safe ones, not ones that could collapse 60 percent, as in a fad company running out of steam, 

 That‚Äôs kind of the strategy with covered calls really I think you want to employ."

2021-06-30 17:13:28,stocks,"I am in a **fantasy stocks league** with my family. The gist of it is that you get $100,000 (paper money) to spend evenly across 10 assets that are traded on the NYSE to start the year. We started it on 12/31/2020, and the competition is to see whose portfolio is worth the most at the end of the year. Winner gets $100 from each entrant.

There's some rules about dividends and acquisitions/mergers, but don't worry about that.

At the half-way point in the year on July 1 (and only on July 1), you can sell up to four of your holdings and buy new assets. For example, I bought $10,000 worth of $MSFT to start the year, which is currently worth $12,200. I could elect to sell that stock and buy a different asset. 

Must own 10 different holdings.

I am currently in last place (measly 8.20% gain YTD), and need some growth! The great thing about this league (vs a real portfolio) is that risk tolerance really doesn't matter - it's win or go home!

I have a very detailed and intricate portfolio tracker as the league manager, with all sorts of calculations and figures for every holding in the league.

**So I ask the community: which stocks/ETFs should I sell, and which should I buy?**

My current holdings: 

* Cloudflare Inc ($NET)
* Microsoft Corporation ($MSFT)
* Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD)
* Nio Inc ($NIO)
* Square Inc ($SQ)
* Walt Disney Co ($DIS)
* iShares Global Clean Energy ETF ($ICLN)
* ARK Genomic Revolution ETF ($ARKG)
* ARK Innovation ETF ($ARKK)
* Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ)

I'm stuck with Comcast, literally no other options.  The only benefit with Roku, the Xfinity app is pretty stellar.  It's basically a Roku app version of their X1 platform.  It has been in beta forever.  When the FCC said they were going to let customers own their own cable boxes or alternatives, it spurred this development and was finally a break for the consumer.

Financially smart but not financially wise consumers also are really bad at justifying financial decisions. They see record low rates and think they need to lock in a house purchase, not realizing that the low rates are just driving up the price of the house and you really arent that much better.

Lastly, from my connections in the biz cash out refinances are at an all time high right now. I have no faith in the average consumer to be smart with that money. 

&#x200B;

Overall, the only ones that should be concern are those leveraging up to the hilt to get in or those who made a big stretch to buy a house. If you already own then nothing to worry about. Your home is NOT an investment - it's a place you pay to live - remember that and youll be ok.

I don't foresee landlords *not* taking the opportunity to give themselves raises based on the current inflated market costs *especially* because they can justify it based on recouping lost income over the last year. To compound the problem units that are returning to the market are going to drip-feed due to the court processes involved in evictions so the market won't flood enough to put power into the buyer/renter's hands."

They have AI/ML to streamline everything.

Still, they're regarded as some weak and vulnerable bank when the reality is they're a fintech powerhouse.  

The stock has done poorly, basically flat after one year, compared to banks which have nearly doubled.  It can't be discussed much on Reddit since it's wrongly assumed as a P&D.  

It reminds of how SQ was always regarded as a toy, a joke, $30-40 per share.  When it was finally recognized as a fintech, we saw what happened next.  RKT may never be regarded that way.  But if it does, then RKT gets repriced to a very different valuation."

Do you NEED the additional tax credit to offset gains this tax year?  Rarely can this be 100% applied to future years.  When you're getting into that level of math, it usually is wise to consult your tax professional or accountant.

If you're trying to limit your losses on a defunct holding that is sinking, exit when it makes sense and worry about implications later.  Do not exit early just for a tax credit."

2021-06-30 00:00:00,stocks,"Sentinel One - This will go HAM I have experience in the cyber-security industry.  I'm excited S1 is going public tomorrow.

Crowdstrike stands in a league of it's own.  That's why they are valued at like $58 billion.  They use a threatgraph of all their clients endpoints meta data, storing only meta data (like, this person opened a word document), and have the second largest data footprint on AWS (Netflix is #1...with movies...and insanely huge ops).

SentinelOne has a similar approach.  The platform is slick, has a nice Ui, and is created by israeli cybersecurity experts.  It has less data to work with to correlate attacks (which will change as they add customers and time), but still has amazing potential as they have huge clients (think, one used to be the biggest company in the world...). It works on LINUX (servers!) which is a huge advantage, because CrowdStrike does not \*EDIT: aparently I am wrong, crowdstrike does now work on linux\*.  However, they don't use in-person threat hunting (or it is not quite as developed) they use Ai threat-hunting (most deem inferior, but still amazing and comparable efficacy).

100+% revenue growth YOY, $135Mish revenue.  Coming out valued at approx $8B, vs CS's $58B.

one of maybe 3 total solutions that are truly effective against ransomware/advanced nation state type attacks on endpoints at the highest level (think, S1, crowdstrike, and carbon black).

it's cheaper than crowdstrike, and crowdstrike is expensive, but a more hollistic platform.  S1 will be for companies that want to save some money but still get top tier endpoint protection, and will eventually compete head to head as the sole challenger.  Also some clients like the ability to have endpoint protection for servers running on linux, not sure if crowdstrike has that yet. Think, Mercedes vs BMW.

My personal price target (maybe 40-50 per share) before I think it's over valued is $25B mkt cap, so I think this is a decent 2x play over the next year, possibly more if Biden admin invests more and more in cybersecurity, since S1 and CS are the two best solutions, and both are used by govt. already."

The real pro's that are good at trading a particular style in every market will cost you big money, the sad truth is everyone you teach is now your competition. Hence why it is so difficult to find a true mentor in trading.  Only advice I can give is pick 3-4 stocks in each sector learn how they move do your TA on them get all your DD done make notes subscribe to company investor relations and keep up on the news of them and their competitors.  For me I trade TSLA AAPL and BA nearly every day. ( I trade options ) so that adds a bit to the complexity, if that's your goal learn how the options move and which ones pay which ones lag the moves. If you keep it simple and Back test all of your TA everyday for the last year  and then go back 4 years ( TSLA ) would be a bad choice beyond that for options trading and from there you can expand to more and more tickers 

TLDR: Learning to fish yourself will be your greatest strength.  There are a few good resources on YouTube the bald guy there for options trading tasty trade has videos that are pretty good and TD Ameritrade has both videos and live webinars with Q and A sessions. Keep it simple focus your energy on a small group of stocks that move and stick to trading just those and then expand."

Daytrading is on a whole other level than investing. Be prepared to lose money and put a ton of time/effort into it if you want to do it full time. If you are someone who gets nervous and is afraid of losing money, don't even bother. You're going to fail.

2021-06-30 00:00:00,stocks,"Can someone explain to me whether it's possible to purchase OTC shares while carrying margin debt? I have what I fear is a stupid question about margin trading. Assuming I'm carrying a margin balance and I want to purchase non-marginable OTC securities, do I first need to zero out my margin debt in order to free up cash for the purchase?

The alternative would be to sell shares to pay back the margin and free up sufficient cash to purchase the OTC shares, then re-buy the marginable shares on margin (assuming it's permissible to take on margin debt while owning OTC shares). This would cause a taxable event I'd prefer to postpone.

This seems like a convoluted process and suggests I'm misunderstanding something. I'm wondering what I am getting wrong. I'm using Schwab, if that's relevant."
2021-06-30 01:42:31,stocks,"I think what happens is that your allowed margin is reduced. For example, if you have $1000 of your own assets, they give you $1000 in margin. If you buy $100 OTC stocks, your allowable margin is now reduced to $900, but now your regular stocks are now $100 more into margin.

So if you had $1500 in total non-otc stocks, that is $1000 in your own money and $500/$1000 margin used. But if you bought $100 OTC, you know have $900 in your own money for non-otc stocks, $600/$900 margin used."

2021-06-30 01:41:20,stocks,"What it means is your cost basis for those 5 shares is now 60+(40-35)=55. This is why it's useful to sell shares even at a loss if the price is dropping. If it keeps dropping you can get back in at a lower cost basis. Of course it instead goes up, you now have a higher cost basis than you started with. That's where trailing stops are useful."

Had the business/investment not failed the money could've remained tied up for years making so-so returns.

There is a concern that Buffet is Berkshire and after he's gone the company could lose its touch or not perform as well. Disney had this happen when Walt passed and it was a concern when Bill Gates stepped down from Microsoft

TBH I didn't even look at the financials. It's a strong company that focuses on giving the customer what they ultimately want, a good product for a good price.

But I know it's a stock ticker that doesn't get much respect, and maybe I can rotate out now and back in on the next dip.  On the other hand, if sentiment ever changes or the China growth story catches fire, I don't want to miss that move.  If China is supposedly roaring back, what's better than a stock that gets a boost from China, but has trustworthy American management and reporting?"

I think part of the reason there's not a lot of chatter is because it's boring and there isn't much to say.

Knowing China they'll limit American influence as much as possible.

Of all of my stock picks, Old Dominion Freight Line has made me more money. The past approx. 4-8 weeks have been rough, the stock was trading sideways, then has begun to trade down. Not to sound like a beginner to investing/stocks, but this stock seems undervalued by 10-15% at the moment.

The stimis upped shipping but those are long gone now. So what will be the catalyst for upward movement that‚Äôs obvious to see? What is their rotation on contract negotiations?

2021-06-29 20:52:21,stocks,"They are absolutely one of the best run companies in the country and they've been America's great little secret over the past 10 years.

I currently own 1700 shares and 70 call options in the stock @   290 december strike price.  I also learned 30 call options @ 250 October strike price.

Currently business is booming and they were brought down with the other transports but they always rise to the top in the long run.

I strongly encourage you to start listening to their quarter reports and you will hear during the conference calls that they are running an absolute Superior business to other companies.   Their operating ratio is unreal and their cash on hand is awesome and they carry very little debt.   

They've been managed by the same family for several decades and our growth potential is still very high.

If you ever tune in to see CNBC the morons on there Will recommend inferior companies all the time and it gets really old but it's actually, cool to hear these quote-unquote professionals recommend other companies.   It's almost as if the paid professionals don't have the damn time to read over the income statements of these companies.  It's like they're a bunch of robots with drool running down their chin and all they can ever say is ""buy FedEx and UPS.""

Old Dominion is non-union and to answer your question they're absolutely undervalued currently I would say probably by about 10%.   If you look at the growth metrics over the next two years and do some simple calculations there's no reason the stock should not be trading at at least 375 a share in 2 years.   I say that confidently but we all know that the economy could be run into the ground or there could be some major on for seeing events."

Their operating ratio is better than any other company I can find in the business.

They are buying back stock.

They started issuing a dividend about 4 years ago.

They are family owned and non-union.

You're almost making a recommendation for them to do something so they don't lose business yet all they do is gain business and market share every single year and they've been doing so for like 15 years running."

2021-06-30 00:00:00,stocks,"Long term company research & analysis on SoFi (filter through the noise) I‚Äôve seen a ton of posts about trading SOFI and short squeezes etc. but I‚Äôm investing in SoFi for the LONG TERM and here‚Äôs why:

1. SoFi actually had positive EBITDA in Q1 and is forecasting $27M in EBITDA for 2021! How many high growth, recent IPO‚Äôs can say that!  SoFi is forecasting $254M EBITDA in ‚Äô22, $484M ‚Äô23 ($1.17B in ‚Äô25 but that‚Äôs a bit of a wild card since it‚Äôs so far in the future‚Ä¶).  That‚Äôs a 162% CAGR over 3 years and 113% CAGR over 5.  They exceeded guidance in Q4‚Äô20 and in Q1‚Äô21 !!!  Their forecast is also somewhat conservative since it excludes the impact of the pending bank charter acquisition which could increase these #‚Äôs.  It also excludes some of the new offerings that were just announced like Auto Loans and IPO investing (underwriting).
2. Rapid revenue and customer growth! Forecast of $980M in 2021 to $2.1B in 2023 is a 29% CAGR over 3 years (28% CAGR over 5 years).  2.28M unique customers in Q1 and targeting 3M customers by the end of 2021.  They have a great track record of upselling existing customers (very low cost to upsell vs. acquire) with about 1/4 of their customers using multiple products, this should only improve as they add more product lines (like auto loans‚Ä¶and hopefully options soon!)
3. Galileo technology platform actually turns a major cost center into a profit center and makes them a true Fintech vs. just an online bank like Ally etc.  Galileo is expected to grow 55% CAGR from 2020-2025 with an estimated 62% margin.  This gives them a great B2B model and de-risks a 100% banking model.  Galileo is the Fintech engine behind 70M accounts (Q1 #‚Äôs) and customers include Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, Revolt etc. Galileo‚Äôs APIs power functionalities including account set-up, funding, direct deposit, ACH transfer, IVR, early paycheck direct deposit, bill pay, transaction notifications, check balance, and point of sale authorization as well as dozens of other capabilities.
4. Future bank charter with the pending acquisition of Golden Pacific Bancorp will help juice profitability and revenue growth and lowers their cost of capital.  This is expected to grow profits from $484M in 2023 to $718M in 2023.  If their estimates are correct AND the acquisition goes through that would increase the 3-year earnings CAGR from 162% up to 198%!  This deal should close by the end of 2021
5. Solid leadership:  Anthony Noto, CEO has a strong background in Finance with Goldman Sachs and the NFL (CFO) AND Technology from Twitter (COO).  Chris Lapointe, CFO also has a great mix of Tech (Uber) and finance from Goldman Sachs.  Similar story with the rest of the executive team.  Strong marketing with SoFi stadium in LA (Superbowl venue) and SoFi‚Äôs investment team is frequently on CNBC (Liz Young etc.)
6. Rising interest rates is actually POSITIVE for SoFi!  Banks pay customers a relatively low interest rate on short term deposits and charge customers a higher interest rate on longer term loans.  As rates rise their margins increase.  With rates at record lows, a rapidly recovering economy and inflation on the horizon rates should only go higher (maybe substantially and much faster than normal).  The bank charter only enhances this‚Ä¶.
7. I invested a little in SoFi (via IPOE) originally after it pulled back and wanted to invest more BUT before I did, I opened accounts at SoFi to verify that it‚Äôs all that they say it is.  So I opened a checking account, 2% cash back credit card, active investing account, automated investing account.  This is the real deal:  Products are SUPER competitive (2% cash back on a CC with NO annual fee!), Checking account pays 0.25% with no fees, $0 stock trades for active investing and direct access to IPOs (I participated in their 1st 4 IPOs today - 6/29) and no cost automated advisor investing.  They really treat you like a ‚Äúmember‚Äù and customer service has been great so far.  The mobile App is very user friendly with a ton of added features (credit score, education etc.).
   1. If you own SoFi stock for the long term and you‚Äôre not a customer yet ‚Äì you‚Äôre doing yourself a disservice.  You are an owner in the company and you should be profiting from your own banking!  Try them ‚Äì you‚Äôll love them and start consolidating all your accounts to them like I am.
8. Post lockup period (ended Monday 6/28) we should see a lot more interest from  ETFs, Mutual Funds, Institutional investors and analysts.   Volume should dissipate and the stock held its ground even with 50M shares trading a day (10X normal volume). There is a ton of demand for not only high growth but also PROFITABLE companies and FinTech specifically.   Based on their market cap and projections for profitability they should be added to the Russell indexes next year and possibly the S&P Indexes if they can meet the profitability criteria etc.

Analyst Price Targets:

Oppenheimer:  Overweight $30 Price Target

Rosenblatt = BUY $25 Price Target

I personally don‚Äôt follow Analysts too closely but it does drive institutional investor buying and helps give you a sanity check.

My 2024 Price Target is $42-$50 based on their 2024 projected revenue (with current product offerings, this should increase as they offer new products and finalize the bank acquisition).  This is based on a pretty simple comparison to other FinTech's (Square and Paypal) P/S multiples.  Pretty rudimentary so I'd welcome other input.  

There are obvious risks if multiples come down or if they miss their targets and there is a very high short interest right now but so far they have delivered on all their guidance and growth.

I‚Äôve seen a ton of posts on SoFi trading with a lot of hopes and dreams of a quick hit or WSB pushing it higher and that‚Äôs not why I put my money into SoFi over the past few months.  I‚Äôm an investor not a gambler...but I have been buying some of the dips when it does on sale.

Disclosure:  I‚Äôm long SoFI and it‚Äôs my largest holding.  I continue to buy more on dips and plan to add more in general as they meet their targets and goals, release new products.  I clearly have a vested interest in SoFi going higher but I wanted to share some of the research on the company vs. all the hype that's flying out there right now."

2021-06-30 00:00:00,stocks,"My long as hell, silver DD Sorry this is a bit long winded, but I wanted to put out my entire investment case for silver, maybe just to feel better about having invested most of my life savings into it. I own silver mining stocks, ETF's, and options, but this is the case that ties them together. This is just my opinion. Do you own research, since I‚Äôm not qualified or interested in, giving investment advice.

**Supply**

First, it‚Äôs important to consider that silver is not like other commodities. It sounds kind of silly, but if we were talking about wheat, oil or pork bellies, the supply and demand would have to match, in the long term and the short term. Gold and silver are mostly valued based on existing stockpiles. They have been mined for thousands of years, and for most of that time, excluding the last 150 or so years, almost everything ever mined was still in some sort of usable form. This is why these metals can act differently than almost other commodities. If the price of corn spiked higher, farmers would switch crops to farm more, and it would eventually correct the price to the cost of production and a reasonable profit margin. Gold or silver could go for a long time being too expensive or too cheap, and it wouldn't immediately correct itself, since the price is based more on the huge stack already mined, rather than just what's going to be mined in the next year. This one frame shift is really key to understanding the current state of the market.

Silver is primarily mined as a byproduct of Copper Lead, Zinc, and Gold mines. This may seem like a random interesting fact, but it actually effects the market a whole lot. If we were talking about lithium instead of silver, and the lithium price went up 5x, every lithium mine in the world will go into overdrive, try to expand production as fast as possible, build any new mines they could, and that will eventually reverse or slow the price increase. If you have a mine that produces 90% of their revenue from lead and zinc, they aren't likely to do the same expansion if the 10% of production that‚Äôs silver goes up 5x.

I‚Äôve heard some people talk about the market size of silver as being $1.5T. That's the rough value of all silver ever mined in 3000 years, and is pretty irrelevant in this context. The amount of silver in investible bar form is under 3B oz, which is less than $80B. The Comex has about 110M oz, in registered inventory, and 244M oz in eligible inventory. Eligible inventory is inventory that could be put up for sale if the owners wanted, so it might not be for sale at any given price. The LBMA has 1B oz, but around 85% is already owned by ETF‚Äôs. There is lot of silver in the world, but very little for sale in an investment grade, at anywhere near current prices. For a market apparently worth $1.5T, it seems like you could buy every bar in available in the world for about $7B. That‚Äôs obviously not counting the existing demand, so it might not take a huge amount of new demand to move this market significantly.

Never forget that every oz of silver in the world is already owned by someone. When people talk about ‚Äúnew‚Äù supply coming on the market, that has to be someone who wasn‚Äôt willing to sell at the old price but is willing to sell at the new price.

Although there has been much more silver mined through history, silver inventories have been chipped away for decades by industrial consumption, while gold inventories have grown. Don‚Äôt forget that although gold has grown, so has the human population, and especially the population those with enough wealth to own gold or silver.

The whole mining industry has been slumping for a very long time. Discoveries of new significant deposits are not only down, but new additions to PM reserves fail to add as many oz as are produced each year. If you consider that it takes years between exploring, drilling, permitting, more drilling, and construction of a new mine, there could be a very big lag between the price going up, and any significant new supply entering the market.

Some people say that if the price goes up any significant amount, a flood of silver will come in from old coins, silverware, jewelry, etc, and correct the problem. In 2011, when silver hit $50/oz, the amount of silver recycled, went up about 50%, from around 100M oz to 150M oz, but that increase was only a small fraction of the mine supply (over 800M oz), so the broader supply demand picture didn‚Äôt really change much. There‚Äôs still a huge amount of silver in coins, silverware, jewelry, etc, but if it didn‚Äôt come back into the market at $50 in 2011, why would it come out of hiding now, for less? Also, although there are still lots of old silver teapots and spoons, they don‚Äôt make a lot of new silverware and every year that stockpile shrinks as old spoons get melted down. Much of the silver used in the ‚Äúsilverware‚Äù portion of the current demand pie, is used for electroplating, and that silver is never getting recycled.

Over the past several decades, some of the supply demand imbalance in the silver market has come from governments eroding their silver stockpiles. Many countries used to make coinage from silver, so they had to keep stockpiles, both functionally for making more coins, but also as a strategic and central bank asset. Today, the US, Canada, UK, and most other developed countries, have sold the majority of their silver reserves decades ago. The US government had 350M oz in 1970, and around 50M oz from 2006 to today.

&#x200B;

Silver is found in the earths crust at about a 14/1 ratio to gold. Current mine production is about 8/1, and existing stockpiles of investment grade product are not known well enough to compare, but I‚Äôve heard estimates ranging from 3/1 to 1/1. The current price is 68/1. Gold hit it's all time high in 2020, but silver was half it's nominal all time high, or less than a quarter of it's inflation adjusted high.

If you take a more broad view of value over time, gold and silver have historically been valued along the lines of their production and naturally occurring scarcity, from 10/1 to 15/1. This ratio held for thousands of years. If you look at an inflation adjusted chart of silver prices going back many hundreds of years, silver prices were usually many hundreds of dollars. From 1720-1900, the silver price never dipped below $100, and was as high as $500, in todays dollars. For most of the last 3000 years, an average skilled labourers days wage was 0.1 oz of silver.

Lots of people are talking about a shortage of silver, and it‚Äôs so much bigger of a deal than most realize. Mints are admitting they can‚Äôt source material, and shortages that were once limited to small bars and coins, have spilled over into 1000 oz bars. These days, there are shortages developing in so many things, so it‚Äôs seems normal, but this shortage is nothing like the others. As I said at the beginning, if most other shortages are self correcting by the functioning of the markets (planting more corn, etc), but this market is valued based on a stockpile built over 3000 years, then a shortage means we‚Äôve run out of the stockpiles, and the one and only thing that can correct the supply, is higher prices. Given what we saw in 2011, with very little new silver coming back into the market at $50 (or an average though the year in the mid 30‚Äôs), it‚Äôs safe to conclude that the price it would take to truly balance the market, with no more stack to erode, would have to be dramatically higher than that.

**Demand**

The most important thing to understand about the demand side of the silver equation, is how it‚Äôs changed over time. For thousands of years, silver was money. Before the last 150 years, pretty much all the silver ever discovered was still around, and the demand was that it became money the moment it was found. That‚Äôs a pretty simple demand case. If you were a prospector in the 1700‚Äôs, you could walk into a bar and spend silver or gold you found that day. If you spun some wool, you‚Äôd have to trade that for silver or gold before you could spend it.

Then, over time, more and more uses for silver started to appear. This is when silver gained its hybrid, monetary and industrial status, and this status is really key to understanding silver in the world today.

Today, around 60% of silver demand comes from industry, and that demand is quite inelastic. If a company makes smartphones, and the average phone uses $0.35 worth of silver, you don‚Äôt stop making phones when the price of silver quadruples, and your phone needs $1.40 worth of silver. Silver is used very broadly, since it‚Äôs found in alloys used in most electronics. Because of that broad industrial usage, and the difficulty recovering such small quantities, about 2/3 of the silver consumed is never recovered. If you have a gold watch, someday that watch will break, and the gold will probably end up in a gold bar. If you make a cell phone, one day it will break, and most will end up in a landfill. Even some of the silver that goes through a recycling process still ends up being melted into an alloy so it still isn‚Äôt recovered as silver.

Also, industry demand is almost always hard to substitute. Silver is the most conductive element, most reflective element, and has natural anti microbial properties. These properties are elemental and irreplaceable. I‚Äôm sure if people could easily use copper instead, they probably already would have. There is a natural trend where a single product, like a solar panel, will use less silver per unit, as manufacturing becomes more and more efficient, but that effect is counteracted by more and more products using silver and higher quantities of production driving that efficiency.

Silver‚Äôs industrial demand is highest in fast growing sectors like electric vehicles, solar panels, and electronics. EV‚Äôs use significantly more silver that gas cars, and also use lots in their charging infrastructure. The average solar panel uses 0.6 oz of silver, and 5G networks are expected to increase silver demand significantly as they roll out. The trend is clear, the future needs silver, and things that haven‚Äôt been invented yet, will probably need the irreplaceable properties only silver can offer.

The other side of silver demand is its monetary or investment demand. At the core of this demand is silver‚Äôs historical role as a store of value, as well as the investment case I‚Äôve been spelling out in this and my last post. Silver‚Äôs monetary history revolves around it having the key properties of money: durability, portability, divisibility, fungibility, uniformity, limited supply, and acceptability. It‚Äôs worth noting that every element on the periodic table that meets these characteristics is already considered money. If you eliminate all gasses, all the elements that are reactive and non durable, all the elements that are too abundant to be portable (lead, iron, etc), the elements that aren‚Äôt easily divisible and fungible, so they can‚Äôt be divided and reformed, at the end of all that, you are left with only the precious metals. Maybe you can make the case for copper and nickel, but guess what those have been used for.

So, we‚Äôve established that silver is a store of value based on inherent qualities. That makes it a safe haven investment, since people look to stores of value when the future becomes uncertain. For decades now, the world has been lulled into a false sense of security by the US dollar global standard, coinciding with a period of particularly low inflation. A key driver of that period of low inflation, is deflation in prices of consumer goods, because of globalization. Basically, we keep printing more and more money, but China keeps cheaply producing more and more products. This has kept inflation contained in localized asset bubbles (stocks, real estate, art), and most people haven‚Äôt seen it effect their lives much (until recently). That could change quickly. The low prices we‚Äôve grown accustomed to, probably won‚Äôt keep dropping as we keep printing more money. In short, once China already produces everything, there‚Äôs no prices left to bring down to offset the printer.

For years, pretty much every country in the world has been printing money like crazy, and the only thing that makes it not look crazy, is the fact that everyone else is doing it, and currencies are only valued relative to other currencies. People call this the race to debase. Inflation has gone from a non issue in the minds of the world, to the issue of the day, and that‚Äôs unlikely to change any time soon.

Much of the developed world has forgotten about gold and silver, with academics referring to it as a barbarous relic, and with the biggest pools of money, hedge funds, pension funds, endowment funds, collectively owning less than 1% of their portfolios in gold, and presumably a fraction of that amount in silver. For individuals, the percentages are probably a bit higher than for funds, but as a share of all wealth in the west, precious metals are a rounding error, even today and even with all the attention we give to the space. It‚Äôs just not on most people‚Äôs radar yet.

Basically, we have a good case that demand should be higher, but it‚Äôs actually pretty low in the grand scheme of things, with most individuals owning none and even the biggest funds not bothering to hold any. Despite this, let‚Äôs consider how the market is holding up to this (actually very low) demand.

I can remember a couple times when interest among retail investors spiked up, and premiums on coins and small bars went up dramatically. Every time this happened before 2020, the market would stabilize in months and premiums would fall back down. Producers of small bars and coins got a bigger incentive to make more, so they did, and the market calmed. In 2011, my local dealer would sell me high premium coins, but he could also get me 1000 oz bars at $0.60 over spot.

When covid hit, premiums rose again, but this time they stayed high. The reason is that this time the shortage is across the entire market. My local dealer passes on the prices he pays with a small markup, and his prices have stayed high on coins and bars, but also now his premiums on 1000 oz bars are up to $2.50. Shortages have reached every corner of the market, and there could soon be a time when it simply becomes unavailable.

Scarcity is an incredible driver of behaviour. There are a lot of companies who really rely on silver, and who currently use just in time inventory, so they can‚Äôt keep their operations going for long without new inventory. If I recall the toilet paper aisle in March 2020, when people start to sense a shortage, they tend to stock up. Unlike toilet paper, this won‚Äôt just be driven by fear and need. This would be driven by fear, need, want and greed. Imagine if toilet paper were a target of huge speculators that could easily and cheaply, house many years of global production, and suppliers couldn‚Äôt easily ramp up production, to respond to the shortage. It probably would have left a whole lot more desperate people, willing to pay a whole lot more.

Silver is a market that probably deserves more demand than it‚Äôs getting, but in reality has so little demand that the biggest funds and investors barely notice that it exists. Even this tiny demand has been enough to clean out existing stockpiles and create a shortage. The sleeping dragon in this situation is that industrial users need to buy, regardless of price or market conditions. Prices will rise, shortages will grow, and then industrial users will have to compete with a larger and larger group of investors for scarce supply.

**Summary**

This is a small market, with growing and inelastic demand, and an existing supply demand imbalance, that has been eroding available inventories for years. It‚Äôs currently in short supply (in an investable, deliverable form), and that shortage is getting worse by the day. The silver market is historically prone to wild spikes, and this time, a large spike up in price would actually be reverting to a more normal historical price (over the very long term), in terms of the ratio with gold, and in absolute inflation adjusted price. The physical price diverging from the paper price may force the Comex and LBMA to make more deliveries than they are basically built for, dry up any available inventory, and may cause a large number of paper contracts to owe physical metal they have no way of obtaining at anywhere near current prices.

Industrial users are the sleeping dragon in this situation, needing hundreds of millions of oz per year to operate their businesses, and historically relying on just in time inventory. Now they are being forced to wait to get inventory, and may start to see a shortage ahead. Some may decide that the risk of not getting product or having to pay much higher prices is too great, so they need to take some of the dwindling inventory for themselves. The more scarce it becomes, the more industry will want to stock up. Speculators will get wind of this, and further compete for the last scraps of bullion.

This situation looks to me like a big bonfire, soaking in the gasoline of paper leverage, that may ignite anytime. I‚Äôll be sitting by with my marshmallows, waiting to sell into a market that might look much different than when I bought."

Seriously, it was exactly the same schpeil back then and people were talking gold ratios and yet no one was reflecting how it it did the exact same thing in 1980, and 2011. Think about that. It was the same price 30 years apart. And $40 had more buying power in both years. It's not gonna be this amazing thing in 2021 or 2023.

Firstly, the revenue is not there yet. We just coming off a very hot used car market and shortage in the new car side. Book values are crazy and CARVANA is putting and has been putting to much money in cars. Where are they going to get the inventory to reach the revenue of others?

They have no service or parts like the new car franchises which is a big revenue and profit center. F&I products sales penetration is less with online as well. They have their own financing which i suppose is their big feature like carmax or even better Drivetime. 

The online buying and delivery option can be done by any other franchise. There is nothing unique to it. If you look how lithia motors for example expands their used car inventory in 500mile areas to compete. 

They spend a lot of advertising dollars on Cargurus, [car.com](https://car.com) etc.. With online only what are their conversions like compared to the others that have active sales departments. 

Just a few of my thoughts about the stock. Any ideas or what is the ONE THING that i am missing about CVNA?

I think its rather obvious to see that raising interest rates just .25% would ease up these so call ""shortages"" which are really what they say when a commodity has a huge spike in prices. We have ""shortages"" everwhere from wood to used cars to real estate.

&#x200B;

My question is, is it really that difficult to bump interest rates up .25% just to help ease the amount of inflation that is happening around the USA? 

&#x200B;

I noticed that other countries are also raising rates already and even India & china have higher interest rates than the USA right now. Why do they insist waiting until 2023-2024?

 One of the first things u studied if you took economics was that 0% interest rates (making money free and printing alot of it) leads to hyperinflation. We are supposed to be able to put our money in the bank and collect at least 2% in interest rates. Why is money so cheap still? None of this is adding up. So I was hoping somebody could explain why interest rates are going to stay at \~ 0% for more years. I am so scared to invest in the stock market now seeing as to how pumped up it is with fake money. Its so obvious that it only goes higher because of 0% interest rates."
2021-06-29 21:19:32,stocks,"They can't raise rates, too much debt. 1% raise in rates is 300B of interest payments on the national debt. Back in the day the debt was financed with long term fixed rate debt, since 2001 they've been financing with short term, so the national debt is like an adjustable rate mortgage. This is why Volcker was able to raise rates in 1980 and why they can't now. Raising rates will cause complete collapse."
2021-06-30 00:57:40,stocks,"The Fed holding over night rates between 0 and .25% isn‚Äôt causing shortages. It‚Äôs a combination of:

* Federal stimulus, enhanced unemployment,

* a lack of options for people to spend money on, 

* companies shifting/canceling orders orders last year only to have demand surge

* Border and trade restrictions that went up as COVID spread

The Fed moving interest rates up .25% isn‚Äôt going to do shit to address shortages. Shortages are just going to have to work themselves out through market mechanics of supply and demand. People being able to spend on travel, flights, hotels, concert tickets, hotels, strippers should reduce price pressure on consumer goods and move that pressure to services that are having trouble with staffing.

As for other countries moving their interest rates, it‚Äôs mostly developing economies that are trying to balance their currency outflows. They are having to raise rates so their currencies don‚Äôt collapse against the dollar, which in technical terms would fuck their economic recoveries. 

While a lot of the stimulus coming from the federal government is leading to increased rates of short term inflation, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs support of the bond market will primarily stay within the financial markets and not lead to consumer inflation outside of the housing market."
2021-06-30 09:39:57,stocks,"Federal Reserve has a dual mandate for maximum employment and consistent inflation near 2% over the long run.
The federal reserve is far from reaching their maximum employment. They discovered that the 3.5% unemployment rate pre-covid was not creating the inflation needed to reach their 2% inflation goal. The federal reserve expects to start raising rates once employment is back to 2019 levels.
From 2009-2019 core CPI was persistently below their inflation target. Core CPI when compared to 2019 is not running significantly above their 2% goal. During this time period people wrongly said there would be hyper inflation from similar money printing and 0%rates.
Current CPI looks high because of the lowered year over year comps when gas was at $1 per gallon last year.
Inflation is transitory because of the low year over year comparisons and temporary shortages. Businesses are going through a bull whip effect of ordering 2x to increase inventory and restock for sales. Once inventory has been restocked and staffing is back to 2019 levels there will be less shortages.
A small increase in interest rates will not eliminate aggregate demand for what is primarily a business restocking shortage."

2021-06-30 04:34:27,stocks,"Economy works cyclical. While it seems like those are just natural things that happen over time it's more controlled than you might think. Everything. And it makes sense, whenever you left something to humans uncontrolled it went crazy. Just look at celebrities. Half joke aside, these periods can be weaker, stronger, longer, shorter. The only part that remains true is that the positive and growth parts always outweigh the negative parts. So usually the positive one is kept so long that it almost seems like economy could collapse into a Venezuela 2.0 and then a heavy trigger is pulled. 

The cyclical changes are supposed to disrupt and counteract the asynchron behavior among them. This is really hard for me to explain in English. In short, depending on what the country wants to do you have more extreme times ahead of you later on. And while it seems reasonable to adjust interest rate at any time depending on what happens, it's actually insanely counterproductive. It's like a free ticket for the economy to go as crazy as it can, and when recession hits it reverses heavily into no loaning, no growing, no high expenses. And these cycles allow you to interrupt e.g. price setups from companies and reset pretty much everything on the market that has a life depending on companies (e.g. products based on production and competition value and less on the owns products value will come down hard here)"
2021-06-30 07:18:34,stocks,"Because slowing down a rebounding economy too soon can be devastating. Early rate rises and fiscal austerity pushes really screwed up a lot of recoveries after the financial crisis.

Risk of hyperinflation is around zero. That's not a plausible outcome here."

2021-06-30 10:36:50,stocks,"Most inflation metrics are measured year-over-year, meaning that ""echoes"" from past economic events can create distortions in what the real rate of inflation is. For example since this time last year we were seeing very low economic growth we would expect inflation a year on to be slightly above-average. When you combine this with a shortage of available shipping services to get Goods where they need to go and you have an economy that's Prime for a short-term price spike.

In other words the reason the FED has an increased interest rates yet is it doesn't need to, the current inflation figures have more to do with covid than it does with the fed's interest-rate and as such the FED is unlikely to change the interest rate. 

To take this a step further bow I would question whether or not changing interest rates actually has the effect that that claims because the data does not support that raising interest rates decreases inflation or demand for money and instead points toward the exact opposite."

[https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/09/the-pace-of-boomer-retirements-has-accelerated-in-the-past-year/](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/09/the-pace-of-boomer-retirements-has-accelerated-in-the-past-year/)

Baby Boomer retirement is slightly ahead of schedule with \~40% of all individuals of that group already retired. In the coming years, another 40 million people (give or take a couple million) will be retired.

Per this:

[https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/average-net-worth/](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/average-net-worth/)

basically everyone over the age of 55 has an average net worth of $1.2 million and median net worth of \~$250 THOUSAND.

IMHO, the FED needs full employment quickly to ensure economic stability ASAP. It needs full employment (probably with some inflation) in time for the majority of those additional \~40 million to retire so any interest raise will naturally coincide with a need to cool off an expansionary economy. In that way, economic stability is maintained while ensuring (as much as is practible) the recently retired can live on their ""savings"" as long as possible.  


If the FED raises rates now, they risk stifling a post COVID economic recovery, reducing retirement accounts that are probably too low as it is, and result in needing rate reduction at the exact time when retirees need higher interest rates most."
2021-06-30 15:25:59,stocks,"So, it sounds like you have missed out on gains and want the Fed to tank the market so you can get it. The Fed is not going to raise rates until the data suggests that the inflation is *persistent* rather than transitory. Of course, we are going to see inflation now. The economy has been shutdown partially for the last year. Once you open up and people start spending, inflation will spike. 



If we are still seeing 4-5% inflation in mid 2022, I'm sure the Fed will act, but if we trickle back down to 2% inflation, there is no need. One of the mistakes the Fed made in 2018 was continuing to hike rates with inflation less than 2%."

There is a great divide within the FED\`s central planning right now. They are just kind of going along with what Jerome Powell says publicly.

&#x200B;

c) I saw that states are literally rejecting the extra federal unemployment benefits because its causing people to not want to work and just collect a paycheck. There are a ridiculous amount of jobs right now everywhere. People sort of or kind of just dont want to work right now (I am not sure why for this one).  So the ""unemployment"" is more transitory than the inflation in my opinion.

Again all of this is my opinion trying to look at this things from a more open perspective rather than what the media says."

Its simple human nature. Pandemic plus low interest rates makes a lot of people feel like they need to pull the trigger on a house because debt is cheap and that they need to take the high road and live in a detached house rather than crowd up amongst the peasants in multifamily complexes. Once emotion gets involved bubbles start to form and risk aversion goes out the window. Eventually, reality hits and it all comes crashing down."

There is not enough people in the younger generations to make up for the coming shortfall of consumption. Once the boomers are on social security they will have a strict budget and won't afford to consume how they did before. This is why I believe prices will be deflationary, not inflationary.

Imagine, all those big banks.... having to sell those toxic mortgages and loans at micro-pennies to the dollar.  So many people could have renegotiated their terms/principals.  That's what should have happened.  It would've hurt like hell, but we would be much stronger today."

You are literally admitting that there aren't enough people to fill available jobs. That causes incredible rises in wages and a rug pull in utilization.

As for pensions I'm just uncertain how the corporations/government will even be able to meet those obligations for the next 20-30 years. With declining consumption leading to declining profits and declining labor force leading to declining tax proceeds I just can't see how they will not cut those benefits at some point in time."

2021-06-30 06:05:32,stocks,"This is more a matter of personal preference. Most rich people got there through leverage of some sort. One of the most common forms of leverage being loans on real estate. 

For example if you own a $100,000 piece of property and over the course of two years, it goes up 20%, you now have an asset worth 120,000.

But if you own 5x 100,000 pieces of property with a $20,000 down on each and an $80,000 mortgage on each and they all can go up by 20%.  Well now you just turned $100,000 into $200,000 and you got to write off the interest on the $400,000(5x$80k) worth of mortgages on your taxes.  The leveraged money did more work for your bottom line.  This style of investing has worked out for many people.

But there is a certain peace of mind to knowing you don‚Äôt owe anybody anything.

I would rather invest my money and make an average of 10% a year while paying the bank 3% a year on the loan. I end up ahead 7% a year on the money over a LONG time frame.  Obviously there are cases where this isn‚Äôt true in the short term but there is not a single case in the US so far where investing loses to a 3% loan over a 30 year term"
2021-06-30 10:07:37,stocks,"Using my personal home as cross collateral is more risk then I want, since the downside/market turn results in potentially being homeless.

However the wife and I do have 2 rental properties already.  Duplex is the greatest entry into real estate we could have asked for back in 2015.  Before Covid we planned on pushing a 3rd rental, but now more liquid assets seems to be the better play.  Wait and see what the economy does.  Too many moving pieces between the money printer, FED stuck with low interest rates, supply chain shortages, snowballing inflation, etc.

Our LLC protects our personal property and investments.  While the leverage from the real estate essentially has us managing over $1 million in assets with a single income household.  It's kind of crazy but that's how leverage and real estate work.  The property itself acts as collateral. 

Real estate makes more millionaires then any other sector by the way."

2021-06-30 07:10:37,stocks,"With leverage comes risk.  I have 7 homes with I rent.   The key is to get in while everyone is getting out.   In my case it was in 2008.   However, in order to maximize that you have to have cash at the beginning of the crash as well as a steady income source to get through it.  Telling people to leverage now is crazy as the properties and sticks are overvalued."
2021-06-30 07:40:37,stocks,You don‚Äôt make any sense. ‚ÄúAny debt is bad‚Äù but suddenly you now have 7 homes that you presumably bought with debt?  Sounds like debt either wasn‚Äôt bad for you or you just came from a place of already being rich.

 **AMMO, Inc. Reports Financial Results for its Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year**

**‚Äì Annual Adjusted EBITDA of $8.1 million and Adjusted EPS of $0.07 per share ‚Äì**

**SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., June 29, 2021** ‚Äî AMMO, Inc. (Nasdaq: POWW, POWWP) (‚ÄúAMMO‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), a premier American ammunition and munition components manufacturer and technology leader, is pleased to announce it has reported financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter and year ending March 31, 2021.

**Financial Summary for Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2021 vs. Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2020**

* Sales for the quarter were $24.2 million ‚Äì an increase of 409\*\*%\*\*
* Gross Profit Margins increased to approximately 23% ‚Äì an increase of 179%
* Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 58\*\*%\*\*
* Adjusted EBITDA increased to $4.8 million ‚Äî an increase of 296%
* Adjusted EPS increased to $0.04 ‚Äì an increase of 167%

AMMO is positioned for exceptional growth in Fiscal 2022 after establishing a new standard for the Company. Demand fundamentals in the US domestic ammunition market are exceedingly strong and we are seeing no indication of slowing. The Company broke ground on its new state-of-the-art plant, scheduled to be fully operational in approximately one year. And we have established the Company as a cutting-edge design firm, announcing a contract for the design and manufacture of technologically advanced ballistic match ammunition for the US Department of Defense. Our fiscal fourth quarter delivered the best quarterly performance in Company history, with even better quarters reasonably expected to follow throughout Fiscal 2022.

Additionally, the Company experienced sales growth of 46\*\*%\*\* quarter-over-quarter, a $7.6 million increase.

The Company‚Äôs margins have also increased to approximately 23% for our fourth fiscal quarter, an increase of 179% or $7.1 million year-over-year. When depreciation and amortization are added back to the cost of goods sold, our gross profit margin increases to 27% for the quarter.

Our operating expenses as a percentage of sales was 25\*\*%**, representing a 58**%\*\* decrease from the prior year quarter. For the year, our operating expense as a percentage of sales was 27%, a 61% decrease from the prior year.

Net Loss for the quarter was approximately $463,000, which includes approximately $3.4 million of non-cash expenses. Net Loss for the year was approximately $7.8 million, which also included $10.1 million in non-cash expenses.

Adjusted EBITDA has grown to $4.8 million for the quarter ‚Äì 296% increase from the prior year. For the year, our Adjusted EBITDA was $8.1 million ‚Äì 213% increase from the prior year.

The continuing improvement in adjusted EBITDA and margin shows the impact of the scaling we are beginning to see in our operational costs. We expect our first half fiscal 2022 EBITDA to be better than the second half of fiscal 2021 as a standalone.

AMMO‚Äôs adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased to $0.04 for our fiscal fourth quarter, representing a 167% year-over-year increase. Our adjusted EPS increased to $0.07 for the year, representing a 150% increase from the prior year. Adjusted EPS is a metric the Company values as we believe it is a better representation of the Company‚Äôs true operating performance.

The revenue guidance for the 1st quarter of our 2022 Fiscal Year is $41M and will include two months of operations from our newly acquired Gunbroker.com assets. As previously announced, we expect to achieve profitability in this quarter."
2021-06-30 03:18:11,stocks,"I covered this one for my weekly option play on my YouTube channel this past Sunday. The company's in for even more growth very soon; their new manufacturing facility in Wisconsin should be open by sometime in H1 of 2022, which will more than double their production capacity, and the ammunition shortage isn't ending any time soon."
2021-06-29 22:19:47,stocks,The numbers were great but the the conference call was horrendous. I watched as the after hours was dropping because of bad answers or representation of the future of the company. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôve been jacked on POWW since July of 2020. I just think the presentation needs to be better at this point in the game.

2021-06-30 19:03:02,stocks,They are currently building a new facility to triple their production. I think they are using their profit revenue to pay for the construction to avoid taking out loans. Therefore their books show it as a liability.
2021-06-30 11:57:18,stocks,"I'm not a gun savvy person by any stretch of the imagination, but I have been around enough of them to follow a conversation.  I easily recognize most of the the large brands and some of the smaller brands. I've never heard of Ammo Inc. I actually had to google them and I couldn't find much about them on the usual gun related sites.

From what I can see, they have a very limited line of product, one line being extremely niche (handgun rounds similar to tracers, but not incendiary. Not really something gun enthusiasts will stock up on.

Perfect example of a bunch of idiots on Reddit not understanding a market."

2021-06-29 20:25:37,stocks,Irwin Simon gets flexibility to make deals from a position of strength. Just because he can use shares does not mean they are instantly dilutive I trust this CEO to make great deals he has strong history of it and also being very share holder friendly. And oh by the way no MJ has the track record of consecutive cash flow positive performance quarters as Simon as accomplished with aphria and now tilray. I am long time shareholder of aphria and Simon has given me a ten bagger so I have zero reason to vote against anything he asks for.

2021-06-30 09:55:36,stocks,"In short, yes. The stock is going to rise long term no matter what, barring some horrendous decision, and federal legalization of marijuana is just a matter of when at this point.

2021-06-30 00:00:00,stocks,"DMAC down after positive results Realized after market close one of my stocks (DMAC, DiaMedica Therapeutics) was down 33% today. The news is that they got positive (maybe mediocre?) results on an interim test.

Is there a red flag here besides the sudden drop?

I'm a newbie investor here, still learning a lot and I'm wondering if I should buy during the dip or if this is a big ol' warning to stay away."
2021-06-29 21:27:07,stocks,"I also have $DMAC and was surprised by the drop based on the positive interim results for their phase 2 kidney treatment. I'm still sold long-term on them. They also begin phase 2/3 on a treatment for acute ischemic stroke by end of summer. This stock has solid potential to go much higher in a year or two, though it's a high risk play as all biopharma.


I personally enjoy going into the biopharma stocks because of the high risk, high reward with them. It's a respectable, but not too large, size of my portfolio and I've made some solid returns from some big winners. $DMAC was about 150% gains for me back in February, but even then I knew it has potential to go noticeably higher in the next year or two.

Since DMAC is back around where I bought in at, I may buy some more."

2021-06-30 00:00:00,stocks,NVDA vs AMD. Which is the better buy for the long term? NVDA is a beast of a stock that has seen a huge run up lately and will be split 4:1 in late July. Many anticipate a spike after the split since it could attract more investors. AMD has also been on a nice run but seems to be the better value of the two with more room to grow. Which of the two would you buy and why?
2021-06-30 01:32:40,stocks,"If you're holding NVDA already, lucky you. Personally, I would not buy NVDA right now when the stock is *this* hot. If it has a noticeable pullback, I might get in with a few shares in anticipation of the upcoming split, since stocks generally tend to do better after splits.

AMD is also running quite hot right now, and a discount free cash flow valuation shows that it's well above what its intrinsic value should be. If I was looking to buy one of these, I'd wait for a pullback first.

Of course, I'm saying this as someone who's currently holding INTC shares and utterly disappointed by how far this once-dominant CPU giant has fallen."
2021-06-30 00:14:27,stocks,Why not both?
2021-06-30 01:28:18,stocks,"AMD simply because Nvidia is so overvalued at the moment. It's hard to justify that valuation. Also, Intel is releasing a dedicated GPU which is more competition for nvidia. 

I'd still pick Intel over those two even if they were all valued at the same ratio. They have the better long term competitive advantage and the market is totally detached from this reality at the moment."
2021-06-29 21:48:17,stocks,"I like NVDA better as a company, even if their valuation is a little crazy right now.  AMD may be a better bargain at current prices.  But if the Arm deal goes through, NVDA is going to be unstoppable."
2021-06-30 00:46:34,stocks,"I would take Nvidia over AMD because of the potential ARM deal.  Low-power, massively-multi-core is the way of the future."
2021-06-30 10:52:02,stocks,"I have held AMD since $2.20 and I personally like the underdog aspect.  I realize that has nothing to do with how well they will perform, but it makes me happy.  They are hungry and are doing well at gathering market share."
2021-06-30 13:46:33,stocks,"NVDA for two reasons.

In the AI/ML market, they are pretty much unparalleled.  nVidia's CUDA and their Telsa processors are industry standard, nobody else is even in the market!

nVidia's recent purchase of ARM was a smart move.  A lot of cloud providers are looking at moving off of x86 and to ARM.  Even though the CPU doesn't say ""nVidia"" they'll be paying nVidia royalties.  I expect that to start blowing up, particularly because of the success of apple's M1 chip."
2021-06-29 20:23:18,stocks,AMD! How much do you think NVDA can grow over the next few years? Now how much do you think AMD can grow over the same amount of time?
2021-06-30 09:20:35,stocks,You spelled Gee Emy wrong.
2021-06-30 00:32:23,stocks,"Nvda short term AMD long term

I hold both"
2021-06-30 05:04:36,stocks,"After having read the intelligent investor, I wince every time an 'investor' says this is a good stock, instead of this is a good company."
2021-06-29 20:53:46,stocks,I hold both and feel that is the best. The companies are excellent at what they do.
2021-06-30 02:33:08,stocks,Neither. LRCX and ASML!!
2021-06-30 03:57:58,stocks,"I‚Äòd go with both for the longrun. But NVDA exploded (rightfully so) in the last weeks as AMD is catching up depressed and shorted to the titts because of the Xilinx deal. If ARM goes through NVDA will explode. If ARM goes through there is no reason to thinK Xilinx won‚Äòt go through and AMD will increase a good chunk as Xilinx will explode, because 1 xilinx will equal like 1,5 AMD shares diluting the over all share price of AMD while still increasing 

If that shit is behind us. They‚Äòre both great picks"
2021-06-30 04:21:12,stocks,"Both. However, NVDA's current valuations seem a little too stretched out for me. I would wait for the share split and see how it performs then. Arm's acquisition, the chances of it happening is around 30% at the moment, so that could be a wildcard. Regardless, extremely good company to own for the long term with the whole AI tailwind behind it. 

I love AMD for its tech advantage over Intel. Intel, despite changing CEOs recently, still is showing complacency with delays (one just announced yesterday). Moreover, there is a short-term potential catalyst of the Xilinx merger."
2021-06-30 08:57:50,stocks,"I hold both. Nvda since $169 and amd at $14. 
You can buy more than one company, sometimes there's 2 winners."

2021-06-29 20:00:48,stocks,"This

And i have never looked into either stock, but they are both doing very well for different reasons.

AMD CPU performance has been catching up with Intel for years, and last year they really caught up. In some ways AMD has actually surpassed intel, and i expect Intel could be considered the underdog very soon. (before anyone jumps in i realize some already consider them the underdog)

AMD is also neck and neck with Nvidia for GPUs, but unlike Intel i see them as strong competition in the future so i doubt they will end up being the un questioned leader in the GPU market. Plus as the chip shortage ends, and the millions who have been waiting forGPU can buy one we are going to see massive GPU sales for both.  


Really. What do people expect is going to happen with GPU sales after customers spend 2 years being denied the option to even buy one outside Ebay?"
2021-06-30 18:46:37,stocks,"AMD is diluting itself mightily with the XLNX acquisition.

If you didn't buy XLNX before the first announcement, you're losing money on that deal."

2021-06-30 11:40:55,stocks,Geez you're one lucky guy
2021-06-30 18:51:25,stocks,"GPU is also what props AMD up, but they are missing out on the AI/ML market that nVidia dominates.

And, despite being handed a clear opening by Intel they can't seem to actual win serious market share in fungible CPUs.

Intel just gave them another 3 months into mid 2022, and then it's game-on again.

nVidia is racing ahead for good reasons, but it may have overheated and be a few years ahead of its real value."
2021-06-30 18:52:47,stocks,That's not a ratio on AMD's side.

My question:  are my shares considered something of lesser intrinsic value than the future offered Reg-A shares? Basically, are my shares considered the same as future offered shares (i.e.- class A common, class B, etc.) My uneducated guess is that the shares are considered the same type of share I currently own. Furthermore, is the Reg-A offering simply a benefit to the company to offer shares under different regulatory purview? I currently do not have deeper information on the tier of Reg-A offering or more information, I simply know that the company has stated intent of a Reg-A offering. I have researched the topic but have not been able to clarify my question, maybe I am overthinkng ths situation. Thanks in advance!"

PSTH (UMG + future Bill Ackman SPAC + SPARC warrant for another SPAC). Really believe that music has been extremely under-monetized.

Also guess what all of the top 10 of the biggest music stars of 2021 were under UMG as their record label. Any future streaming service will need to partner with them in order to survive, I really like the future outlook.

There are a lot of homebuyers who see their 2nd+ house as an investment, and with the situation with tenants being unable to pay their rent, the landlords are more inclined to convert the house into an ABNB instead.

Regardless Dwight was ready.  
If we have a drop we can't recover from you will have done yourself a favor if you did some doomsday prepping but if it is like every other crash we recover from here are my steps.

Have an emergency fund.  Six months cash helps a family financially weather most storm including enough household provisions you can hunker down for a month and not be forced to buy anything in the event of hyper inflation or another lock down.  

Own quality.  Meme stocks are fun but most meme stocks would struggle in a 2008/2009 market event.  Proctor & Gamble is higher now than october 2007.  General motors did not survive the great recession.  Quality vs. garbage in a down market quality wins out 99 out of 100 times.  
I rode out 2008 and the covid crash fully invested.  If you are timing a market exit you better have a re-entry plan.  The bulk of investing failures who lost 70% and never recovered either owned total garbage investments without proper diversification or they pulled out at a low point and didn't reenter.   If you are down 25% it is probably too late.  

Do not over extend.  100% of foreclosures happen to homes with mortgages.  If Married be able to circle the wagons and survive on one income.  If single be able to survive on half your income. 

We have always recovered.  Just be able to ride the wave.  If we don't recover the prepping route was the way to go.  Just avoid getting swept up in a cash crunch or debt default and you will survive and then thrive in the recovery."

Bullish on WWR as they are trading at half the cost of LAC and are also an American based lithium mining company that I can see US auto makers trying to get their hands on and utilize the resources.

1. Q2 EARNINGS beat EBITDA expectations. Q3 ER includes FabCBD's 70%+ margin, so Q3 will be huge.
2. COMPS. HITI is way undervalued at 2x P/S(!). The Nasdaq listed cannabis stocks competing for institutional capital are overvalued & unprofitable, powered by dilution & delusion. USA comps get no love on the OTC.
3. ACQUISITION targets are in a loaded deal pipeline at all stages of negotiation. Raj negotiated sweet deals on grasscity.com/, smokecartel.com/, fabcbd.com/,  & dailyhighclub.com/
4. FINANCING. Non dilutive commercial bank financing will be secured soon.
5. ETFs (THCX, YOLO, HMUS) now hold positions, and are adding.
6. INSTITUTIONS are quietly building positions before they make their ""BUY"" analysis public. Low float = rapid moves to the upside
7. STORES. 89 currently. \~110 EOY. 200 = new goal"

0SI.F (not the main ticker, but not allowed to name it because of silly rules) - Currently executing on insane growth. Targeting to exceed current BYND revenue numbers by 2023 while currently at only 1/30th their market cap.

TTCF - Undervalued and stably growing company in a growing market.

FUV - Ton of potential. 2022/2023 will be huge for them if they execute.

UPWK - Simply 100x better than Fiverr and geared towards the enterprise market which will be much bigger than retail. Steady 25% annual growth for years to come as we move towards the freelance economy.

ARKG - Genomics is the biggest opportunity in the market for the next 10-20 years. Stock picking is too risky in this market, so ARKG is the best option.

If you're looking at stocks with low multiples, TTCF is the stock for you. If you're willing to look 1 year ahead, it's 0SI.F."

2021-06-30 13:08:10,stocks,"Can I ask your reasoning on ETSY?  
  
I own it for the next 5-10 years. So I'd for sure like to hear your thoughts on it. Is there something fundamental I'm missing?  
  
My ""highest conviction"" plays are speculative/secular. You might ask why, and I would say I am hoping for a better return in the 10 year time frame. I do also own some established growth/dividend stocks.  
  
My highest convictions:  
  
(LCID). The idea here being that this company is able to do even half of what TSLA did. From a secular standpoint, EV is strong 2020s, the board of this company is a lot of talent, the funding is excellent, and the technology is in the best of breed and vertically integrated.  
  
RBLX. The idea is the metaverse. Maybe this place becomes an everything hub of online living. The kids using it now will become adults using and paying $ later.  
  
LRCX (Lam Research). I wanted to own chips for the next 10 years, but I think the real $ maker is the people supplying chip makers. Either with materials or technology. Lam makes the technology/machines required.  
  
OUST (Ouster, Lidar company). OUST trades at multiples below all the major lidar companies, yet actually already in the real world, with real revenues that are growing, 500+ customers, making strategic contracts with them, already past several generations of sensor, and wide patent moat.  
  
DT (Dynatrace cyber security....but also....) so I could have gone with Palo Alto or Crowdstrike, but I thought DT offered a different pitch. They specialize in using AI for their Cybersecurity.  
  
My list is probably not your zone, but I'd say these are all below $ 100 billion market cap and have more room to run from secular trends.  
  
If I had to look at my portfolio and give you a recommendation more in line with your investments it would be GOOG. Long term growth will continue, and they own 7.5% of SPACE X. I wanted to own a space stock, so this was a two for one. (This might sound crazy but I have higher conviction in my speculative plays returning more than GOOG)"

In 10 years everyone is going to need a charging station at home of some kind, and public charging infrastructure will be massively needed. 

The combustion engine is seeing its final generation in the mainstream. Every automaker is going electric, many of the rapidly. In 10 years EV‚Äôs are going to be really hitting their stride and commanding a majority of the US/European auto market - the two markets where CHPT is already playing.

The market for EV‚Äôs doubled over the last year and it‚Äôs still a minuscule segment as automakers ramp up. The variety of electric vehicles that customers are waiting for will hit the market fast over the next 2-3 years, the government will hopefully add more incentives to buy, and adoption will accelerate.

2021-06-30 13:25:49,stocks,"Okay I like this one. It‚Äôs hard to choose but here‚Äôs my top 5 conviction stocks and an ETF:

1) AMZN - Leader in constant innovation. Dominates cloud, retail and whatever else they decide to do next

2) GOOG - Can you imagine a world without Google search? Top 2 most visited websites in the US are Google and YouTube (aka Google). Leader in data of all kinds which will be crucial to AI

3) NVDA - All about AI here. Once ARM acquisition goes through, I can‚Äôt see anyone catching them. Semiconductors as a whole should continue to outperform but especially NVDA

4) NET - Innovative company with a rapidly expanding product portfolio and great leadership. The need for secure, easy-to-develop applications with strong performance at the edge will only continue to grow. High gross margins and revenue growth (especially in large customers) and very sticky infrastructure will make it worth the high PS multiple 

5) FTCH - Leading luxury fashion platform with an ingenious e-concessions model. This gives the brand more control of the product/pricing which luxury brands want, while FTCH provides the platform and takes a sizeable (about 30%) cut. Also, they‚Äôre partnered with BABA to expand further in China, as well as with Richemont and Artemis. Strong balance sheet after raising capital from the above partners and their revenue/GMV growth the past few years has been ridiculous

6) ARKG - The applications of genomics technology are almost endless but especially in agriculture and medicine. I think AI and genomics (which are related as it is) will be 2 of the defining technologies of the next few decades. Maybe energy/energy storage as well"

Even in Germany, which is like the cash country, you can pay even as a customer of a shitty regional bank with your phone without visa or mastercard.

2021-06-30 03:25:10,stocks,The next decade could be the revolution of payment networks due to the further digitization of the payment industry. China already saw a shift from credit cards to mobile payments. I think that is why V and MA fell behind the other growth stocks the last year

2021-06-29 22:52:28,stocks,"Truth. Many on-premise houses ran Oracle in the past. They're now looking at moves to the cloud with on premise technologies becoming to out-dated, out of support, and slow. Oracles cloud products look like child's play when placed up against Workday. 

Another big one would be Salesforce. Big time expensive, but big time powerful. Integrates well with other systems. And customer service / support, alongside automations and self help, are becoming more and more important as customer volume increases."
2021-06-30 04:52:49,stocks,"I agree that Workday has the superior products, but I doubt they'll be able to disrupt SAP or Oracle.

There's a reason these companies are insanely profitable, whereas Workday isn't: their customers are huge and have been customers for a very long time. In these cases, switching CPM or ERP systems, for instance, isn't a call made by IT or the department heads who will be using the software, but by the C-level excecs. For them, it's a strategic decision and SAP and Oracle have been around forever and replacing them would be a huge hassle. Also, they have such huge margins, they can and will easily undercut competitors like Workday with massive discounts (50-80%).

I hate to burst your bubble, but purely from an investment perspective, I'd rather bet on SAP and Oracle.

Disclaimer: I have been working in the B2B/SaaS software industry for 10 years."

2021-06-30 08:29:05,stocks,"I'm bearish on BA too but citing autonomous driving as a disruption to aviation is absurd. How do you plan on driving from Chicago to Amsterdam, or Tokyo to Auckland? Autonomous driving may take a chunk out of airlines and airliners but to say it'll make pandemic look like a slight correction is a bit of an exagerration imo. I just think it'll take a long ass time (10+ years) for them to recover from pandemic and 737 max shenanigans."

But if you feel comfortable that they‚Äôll continue to grow 30% YOY, you‚Äôd kind of have to be crazy not to have a big position, right?"

2021-06-29 22:22:46,stocks,"This is where it gets confusing but also exciting. 

1. Yes. If you buy PSTH you will own UMG @ 14.75 day one of IPO. UMG will be originally listed on Euronext Amsterdam Exchange so check with your broker to see if they support this but in all likely hood they will uplist on NYSE shortly after IPO. 

2. You will also own PSTHr (AKA Remainco) at ~5.25. PSTHr will continue to search for a company to merge with. This will have funds of 1.5 billion with an additional 1.5 available. Essentially, You can get two companies for one SPAC. 

3. But here‚Äôs the kicker, you will also be allowed to purchase SPARC. Without having to put any money down, Bill Ackman will go out and seek a third merger within 5 years. If/when he does, you can buy in at NAV after he announces. You will not have to have your money sitting in a SPAC without knowing who, what, or when a deal will be announced. You simply continue on with your life and your investing and wait for him to announce and decide at that time if you want to buy at NAV."
2021-06-29 22:53:23,stocks,PSTH is getting direct access to shares to UMG with much better tax consequences than VIVHY though which makes it much more popular. Also UMG works extensively with the artists and live nation on shows so they are in that business but more as a supporter.

Facebook is going to own all the hardware, all the apps, and all the network. Whole online space where Google, Amazon, and Apple aren't allowed. And if not, then I just bought a social media company at a fair price in this market."

I think Visa will be ok for the next decade but digital currencies and crypto are risk factors that have been getting traction lately. They'll be profitable but might not enjoy complete dominance anymore, i wouldn't be surprised if the last 10 years were the peak of credit card dominance. At the very least it's good to be aware of risk factors."

2021-06-30 05:07:54,stocks,"I won't argue that they're growing rapidly. I'm arguing the following:

1) Workday isn't profitable. Anyone can grow while losing money. The big question is if they can turn it around eventually.

2) Even after their recent growth, their revenue sits at $4.3b. It will take an eternity for them to come anywhere close to SAP's $32b or Oracle's $40b (especially if they continue to burn money).

3) You have to consider the global perspective as well. In Europe, for instance, Workday still has a tiny footprint and it remains to be seen if they can establish themselves. Meanwhile, SAP is a huge force in Europe and Oracle isn't exactly small either.

I'm not saying it can't be done. Anything is possible. The question is: Is it probable? Based on the facts, I'd say no, it's not probable. If you go one step further and take company valuations into consideration, there's even less of an argument to invest in Workday. Literally everything needs to go their way for the next 10 years to even come close to the returns you'll see on an SAP/Oracle investment (both of which are relatively fairly valued atm)."

Social media‚Äôs current monetization model is literally tearing the fabric of global civilization apart."
2021-06-29 22:45:25,stocks,"""They aren't going anywhere"". Big disagree. They aren't going completely away, even myspace is around today, but I don't think they have a future 10 years from now with a strong valuation. Facebook did a lot of things right that Myspace didn't. However, FB made a lot of the same mistakes that Myspace did. Ads, clutter, and other revenue stream activities. Great for the stock, on the short term, but plenty of things that the users themselves dislike. 

In January this year, a report came out noting that daily active users in the US has stalled. I've also noticed a trend personally with people not using it. Back in 2010, I had a campus life university job. I had countless new freshmen talking about how they only use FB for keeping in touch with their parents/grand parents, and that Instagram was what was cool. I have friends who are teachers (K-12) and that trend is even more prevalent today, except even IG use is declining (which is bad for FB as well since they own it). 

Privacy concerns, ads, complexity, and user experience are all reasons that younger generations are not on board with it. It's more cumbersome to share thoughts or videos compared to TikTok (which I hate). Photo posting, organization, and viewing just feels antiquated. And I think it will take company doing what Facebook did: creating a more trendy, user friendly, clean, and youth-focused platform to accelerate an exodus. And as people start leaving it, so will the parents and grand parents that have it to stay in touch."

* Buy back in when it seems to stabilize (usualy 2 or 3 days)
* Stay in for the next lil surge and then sell again or stay in if you plan to long

2021-06-30 05:53:12,stocks,"Workday is undervalued when compared to the valuations that Oracle and SAP had while dominant. Oracle and SAP are overvalued because their customer base is shrinking. 

Also, your arguments were missing a few pieces:

1. Workday would be very profitable if they didn‚Äôt spend $2B a year on R&D. Either way they‚Äôve got $3.5B in cash and less than $1B in debt. So I‚Äôm not worried about profitability at the moment. I like that they‚Äôre aggressively chasing growth

2. They‚Äôre still relatively new. I‚Äôve seen their sales and distribution channels first hand, and know for a fact that they are selling like crazy. What you‚Äôre saying is that there is at least $72B of revenue to steal from the legacy platforms with significantly inferior products

3. I will concede this point. SAP definitely dominates Europe and Workday is more focused on North America at this point. But global expansion can always come later

All in all, Workday has a track record of explosive growth and a target market ripe for the taking. It‚Äôs only a matter of time.

This sub is for stocks not investing. If you want an investing sub, go somewhere else. It can be beat and plenty of people do beat it. Any investor who had a tech position in the last decade did it. You could have thrown a dart at any stock during covid and beat the returns on the S&P for the last decade. The most basic fundamental of stocks is buy high sell low, and people are capable of doing that. Just because it doesn't work for you doesn't mean it won't work for people smarter than you. Period."

2021-06-29 23:19:09,stocks,"Google tried to take market share at the height of Facebook growth, long before data sharing and privacy concerns and public hearings. They tried to take market share with a platform that they marketed horribly and was clunky to use (I was a very early user and I work in user experience for a career). And they didn't invest well into it after launch. 

Facebook had natural growth during a time that MySpace was becoming undesirable. It feels like Google walked in expecting to strong arm users based on their name and reputation alone. 

Although, you're right. I say ""All that has to happen"" as if it's easy for a company to create something that's a winner. But look at and consider something.

Many social media platforms have come and gone. Some that were quite large. And a major reason for switching is ease of use and privacy. FB is becoming increasingly bloated. They are beholden to their shareholders. Optimizing revenue streams is a higher priority, a fiduciary duty, than customer satisfaction. CS plays a part, but they've proven that given the choice between another ad section (or sponsored content) and a better user experience, they are picking the ad section. 

A new company/platform is not beholden to the same duties. They can design as they want and create a more idea user experience. It would obviously take a few years of development + marketing + adoption + natural growth, but it's not impossible. It's happened before."

The act of selling something entails conveying ownership, you shouldn‚Äôt be able to convey ownership of something you don‚Äôt own, that makes it a fictitious supply.  The proof is in the next part of the supply/demand definition, it that neither party should be acting with a ‚Äúcompulsion‚Äù.

Riding off what the gentleman shared above, I would like to share my opinion on the *when* to buy in. 


The stock, as seen in the daily chart [over here](https://imgur.com/RbgmdOk)  has been ranging for a while. Mostly I would say because of profit taking and seemingly reaccumulation of positions.





This means, whoever has been reaccumulating here has a strong position to send the stock to another rally. This is also seen by how it seems ready to move as it retests last point of support (see **lps** on the chart) would be the last test it needed before taking off. 






**Full Disclosure**; I have [a few shares](https://imgur.com/KrheSmb) in the company already and now waiting for my the market to react.  







**Other Similar Examples;**


A recent example of such a range and break out can be found on the [$NVDA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9mutj/nvda_play_100_based_on_ta/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share))  post I shared. Entry was also on breakout but I've also recently got into [$ATOS ](https://imgur.com/UCR8oTH) with a few shares [at retest ](https://imgur.com/YhMaAzY) of the break out and $INTC [based on](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwingTradingTA/comments/o746pc/intc_reaccumulation_range_i_notice_a_lot_of_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) the price action analysis of the trading range. 

Others are $AAPL and $AMZN that seem ready to break. 





TL;DR - $HIMX about to breakout and a possible rally may ensue.

2021-06-30 00:48:31,stocks,"Bro, $500k is not a goal. 20% of $500k is only 100k a year and I wouldn‚Äôt call that living your best life. If you‚Äôre 65, I‚Äôm sorry. But if you‚Äôre 23 - be patient. Plus consider inflation and the obvious point made here already that 20% is aggressive. 

My retirement goal is $10M. That‚Äôs broad and considers real estate, inheritance and many other factors. Its a goal and I may never reach it. It‚Äôs also not a reflection of just wanting to jump into retirement or switching day jobs to being a day trader either. It sounds like your goal is more about moving from your day job to spending your days trading stocks. To be specific, I love my job and it prints money + I don‚Äôt work that hard. So I like what I do. I enjoy it. I get a sense that you don‚Äôt like what you do but prefer to day trade. 

If that‚Äôs the case, look at it that way. Don‚Äôt look at it like retirement because it isn‚Äôt. Consider all of your factors like real retirement. You won‚Äôt be able to live off $100k in 30 yrs like you can today. My advice, find a job you love, invest and save. If you really just want to trade all day, you need to grow your wealth in addition to funding your lifestyle while accounting for future unplanned expenses."

I think the more money you have the more you could potentially risk and still be okay. If Buffet gets a 50% drawdown, it‚Äôs not going to affect him one bit. If you only have 500k and it drops to 250k, the climb back up is going to be real hard."

Where is your money invested now?  Traditional IRA?  Roth IRA?  401K?  Unless you‚Äôre in a Roth, you‚Äôre gonna lose 20% right off the bat.

Too many people got into trading over the last couple years (after last year's crash) and think the money they make now (made.over the last 18 months) trading is sustainable. It's not. If you could make 20% every year, hell yeah you could retire and live on the 100k a year. I just don't think that's realistic.

I think the key to retiring (retiring early) is as you mentioned...annual income. As opposed to lump sum savings. And I think diversification is key to that. More to the point is...to have part of that income being a relatively guaranteed recurring income.  Think - a retirement plan from working, social security, passive income from real estate, CDs, bonds, etc.  

It would be nice to be able to maintain a 20% a year profit on investments in the market, but what happens the year that is 0? Or negative 20%?  Let's say you could live on 60,000 a year in retirement, it would be nice to have at least half of that guaranteed, and the prospect of making more than that in a good year, so you could build your nest egg, build your monthly income during good years, to make up for bad years."
2021-06-30 15:13:49,stocks,"10% annually is more realistic return.

It's not that you can't make more it's that you'll risk a lot more to do so.

If it's just passive income you need to pump the brakes on expected returns. Which will involve hedging, stability and definitely no yolos.

On the other hand you could probably survive on 10% of 500k anyway and still save money, just depends on how you want to live."

2021-06-30 17:03:22,stocks,"Never going to happen.  That‚Äôs not a reliable plan.  1) how much do you need to live on? Tally up your expenses today, add an inflation multiplier.  Let‚Äôs say your expense is $25,000 per year and inflation is on average 3 percent per year.  In 25 years, your inflation adjusted expenses will be $52,300 per year.  Social Security will pay you $20,000 a year. You need $33,000 for 25 years, You need roughy 25 times that saved or $825,000 ball park.  

The market returns on average about 7-8 percent but with volatility meaning some years you earn more snd some years you earn a lot less, like negative returns.  Your idea of 20 percent returns? It‚Äôs pie in the sky!!"
2021-06-29 20:00:36,stocks,The best thing about retiring with $500K expecting to make 20% is you'll be looking for work before your skill set becomes so outdated you cannot get a job.

So if you think that the market will give you 8% in nominal return, and inflation will be 2%, 5% is your inflation-adjusted return. 

The S&P500 has had an inflation adjusted average return of about 7%, although it‚Äôs done better recent decades"

2021-06-29 23:52:48,stocks,"Lots of good answers. To me Buffett was trailing closely on his mentor Ben Graham's footsteps, and a bit too closely, when he started out. He was trying to buy a company for  $5 a share that had assets worth $10 a share and then wait, say, a decade for the rest of the market to catch up and realize the true value of his asset. Later on, with more of the  influence of Munger, he came to understand that it'd be better to be $13 for a company with $10 in assets, but that was growing profits at 10% per year every year and also increasing its stock price by 10% per year. By Graham's standards, the latter is overpriced because you're paying a premium over net asset value. But as Buffett would later learn, it is more profitable to take the latter case."

2021-06-30 02:29:34,stocks,"From what i can tell, there are two main reasons. 

One, the need to constantly search for new companies. Company A: Average company trading at 50% discount, grows 3% a year. Company B: Fairly Valued but grows at 15% a year. Whereas simply holding onto a company B will suffice to generate returns over 10 years or more, one needs to constantly search for undervalued company As, which may or may not exist. 

Two, the impact of taxation on compounding. I'm too lazy to do the exact math, but suffice to say, making 20% per year by finding an undervalued stock then selling it, having say 40% taxed results in much lower returns than the same 20% returns compounded over 20 years and paying that 40% at the end."
2021-06-30 05:49:06,stocks,"Buffet himself loved buying cheap companies.  Buying at a discount too nook value for example.

In general low p e stocks are cheap.  They have a low pe bc they have problems in their business or arent fashionable.

The opposite is high p e stock who have high growth expectations built into them.  The minute the growth slows they tank.

2021-06-30 09:19:28,stocks,"The point I was trying to make, not as clearly as I would have liked, is that there are 2 components of the return: (1) the investment return, which is represented by the rate at which earnings compound over time; and (2) the speculative return, which is represented by the change in P/E between the purchase and the sale.  In the short term, the speculative return dominates but in the longer term what matters most is the rate at which the earnings compound.  If you wait long enough, the role of the speculative return becomes trivial.  

What I believe Buffet was saying was that, if you plan to hold stocks for the long term, the thing you should worry about most is the rate at which earnings compound, which in turn depends on the quality of the company, its business model, its moat, etc."

Short interest is at 23 million with an average volume of 8.5 million. Seems like a good setup for a run starting now. Personally, didn‚Äôt see any news that is alarming for the stock to drop a few percent over the last two days.

2021-06-29 20:03:06,stocks,"That's a pretty silly way to look at it. Someone says it's expensive so you respond with other people buy more expensive things and prices go up.

I like Disney just fine and I'm willing to buy but your reasoning needs work.

The reason I need Disney to drop more is because I have other things I want money into so Disney needs to sell for a great price for me to care. A fair price is only important if it's a core holding of mine. Disney isn't core for me. It's just a stock I belive in that I'll buy if it's at a really good price. It's too expensive for something that I'm not buying monthly."
2021-06-30 01:21:18,stocks,"As I said, that not a valid argument to buy a stock. Also even if u are right on the short term and play disney as a ‚Äûreopening-narrative‚Äú, you also should consider higher costs for wages, possible negative effects from the Delta Variant.

2021-06-29 20:13:25,stocks,"tl;dr - get a crystal ball to time it perfectly, or do your thing and stop worrying. People who bought at the Feb 2020 peak and held are by and large still in very good shape today.

In response to a once-a-century pandemic, the markets crashed by 30%. So let's assume this mythical crash will tank the markets between 15 and 20 percent. Which is still an awful lot.

On March 17, the S&P hit a local peak at 3983. It came this close to breaking the 4K barrier before getting sent back down and waiting another couple weeks to break through. Someone who cashed out of their position at the absolute peak that day for fear of ""The Crash"" has already missed out on a 7.7% increase.

If today's peak of 4300.52 was the absolute top before this scary, mythical crash of 20% kicks in, the S&P goes back to 3440. That means this 20% crash is only going to be down 13.6% from March 17.

What if the crash is only 15%? That means it will bottom out only 8.2% below the March 17 local peak.

Next scenario: Imagine this crash kicks in at the end of the year instead of this very instant. And in the meantime, instead of growing 7.7% in three months, let's assume half the growth in twice the time. 3.9%, from today's level, for the rest of the year.

That has the S&P topping out at 4467. Now, from that point, if the market crashes by

* 15%: it drops to 3797.545, or only a 4.6% drop from the March 17th level
* 20% (which, again, is severe and only likely to occur in response to yet another major, generation-defining crisis): it drops to 3573.6, or a 10.3% drop from a *perfectly timed* March 17th exit.

If the crash happens next year, or five years after that, it's almost certain that it bottoms out above March levels. And if you have stayed in the whole time, your awareness of what's driving the markets is that much higher, and it makes you better positioned to capitalize on the recovery and actually accelerate your gains, like what we saw w/ COVID."
2021-06-29 20:32:38,stocks,Nothing. DCAing as usual. If 20% or more drop I‚Äôll take cash outta savings to dump in.
2021-06-29 21:15:47,stocks,"For the most part holding most of what I have and riding it out if it goes down.  Saving all the cash I can now to put into stocks when it goes down and take advantage of the upswing that I missed out on with the covid crash.  


Or maybe just might sell my 15 little shares of a stock I happen to like if it goes to like 10 million a share and quit my job too.  Donate enough of the proceeds to st jude children's hospital to cover taxes, reinvest half the remaining in rock bottom priced stocks while the whole market is on its head and not care what it does cause i'll still have enough to comfortable live out my life.  


Could go either way."
2021-06-29 23:11:34,stocks,"I think it‚Äôs coming in the next 12+ months.  I‚Äôm not 100% certain though.  The market could fall 30%, or hyperinflation might stall that, but still crush the lower classes.

The fed might raise rates while the housing boom is still going.  That should bring stocks down more slowly, leaving less distance to fall.  An increase in minimum wage would also shake things up, and help inject more money into the economy, at the expense of a few weaker companies falling sooner.  Again, might give less distance to fall, but also pushing the fall further out, maybe end of next year.

For now, holding tight, and looking for when the housing market starts to cool off.  I‚Äôm highly diversified, and have increased my safety fund size.  All debts other than mortgage are paid off.  Mortgage is refinanced to a lower rate.  I‚Äôm trying to get caught up on deferred maintenance for the house.  

If I keep my job through the crash, I‚Äôll keep contributing to diversified funds.  If I lose it, I will hope for a lower paying job to stretch my safety fund, and may have to suspend contributions.  That might be a good time to do a roth conversion."
2021-06-29 23:16:28,stocks,"Who knows if the market will crash.  But I am sitting on more cash than usual right now.  I also bought some US I-bonds via [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/) .  Their interest rate is based directly on the CPI-U inflation metric, and so they roughly keep up with inflation.  Right now the interest rate is 3.54% - not bad for an instrument that has nearly 0 risk!  You can only buy $10k per year (or $15k if you are willing to go through some hassle with tax returns and paper bonds).  Also, you have to wait at least 1 year to redeem the bond.  So maybe not the best move if you're convinced the market will crash and rebound in the next year."

In this scenario, the best thing is to buy gold companies such as KGC, GOLD, etc. Nowadays, these sort of companies are at the lowest level in 1-2 years so it could be a great idea. Personally, I am doing it thinking always in a long term (when the crash explode, gold will be x2-x3)"

In 2008, it was the mortgage backed securities that were the big problem.   

Now there's concern about commercial mortgage backed securities.   I believe that's because of all the businesses that couldn't pay rent during the pandemic.

2021-06-30 06:11:46,stocks,"You're new to investing so the thing you need to understand is that your bias will cause you to a) not listen to what I have to say and b) lead you to believe you can do what a very small percentage of people do maybe once in their lifetime. 

You can't time the market. No one can. You may get it once, it may be a nice little windfall, but it would be far better to not try to time the market, in general. You might think you can time a crash, and yes, there are a variety of business cycle indicators you might use, like inverted bond yield, or high yield spread. But you'll never get exactly correct enough where you'd earn MORE than if you had just not tried timing the market and built a diversified portfolio that balances risk and safety. 

People who do this for a living, who went to the best schools, work in the best funds, have more information and tools than you'll ever have, can't time the market. It's the biggest amateur, rookie mistake to think you can, and it's really funny to watch new investors attempt to do so. 

You've probably made a nice return since the crash, and I'm guessing it's your first time investing. This is your massive disadvantage. You're, in many ways, fucked for the rest of your investing career. Because your bias will lead you to believe that you're good at investing, which you aren't, you just bought when everything was at a discount, and you'll assume that all times will be like this period. You basically fell ass backwards into what was a win win situation... in other words, unless you went for really stupid equity, you couldn't lose. 

The track record for winning in a given year, i.e., beating the market, is 50%. That includes the best investors in the world. You won't beat them, guaranteed, over the long term. Maybe you'll get a year in there, maybe. 

Harvest some of your wins, allocate a good portion to bonds, like standard investing advice, don't seek timing advice on Reddit, lol, and invest responsibly. Right now, it's ok to be heavy equity, and for a while, you have time.

A correction is likely coming up very soon in the next month or so but those aren‚Äôt worth the effort to do anything drastic. Just keep a little cash ready to buy. Now protecting against a crash is another story.

If protecting against a small to moderate crash, transitioning away from growth stocks to safer assets like dividend stocks is a way to go just to minimize losses before transitioning back to growth stocks. 

Protecting against a major crash which could take years to recover from might warrant liquidation or holding off on further investments to build a big pile of cash to invest in the market upon the crash. This is very tough to do though and I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôll likely ever do this myself. Best I‚Äôll ever do is anticipate corrections while keeping cash ready to buy or anticipate a small to moderate crash and rebalance a little bit to dividend stocks."
2021-06-29 21:00:21,stocks,"I‚Äôll take a slightly contrarian position here. While no one that can definitively tell you if/when a crash is coming, I‚Äôve been dumping extra money into my mortgage(4.5% risk free rate) rather than buying stocks(should really grow at a 10% rate). The question that got me to do that was ‚Äúwould I borrow money at 4.5% interest to invest in the market in its current state?‚Äù. The answer for me is no. Other people will have different risk tolerance and answers. Still holding all my stocks and don‚Äôt plan on dumping or anything crazy like that, but I think the most likely path from here is choppy‚Ä¶ I prefer a high risk free rate if you can get it over the current market conditions."

2021-06-29 21:43:53,stocks,"So I think odds are likely we experience a major correction soon. I'm a pretty high risk day trader (not really day but short term), more suited to r/wallstreetbets than r/investing or r/stocks.

I regularly put a very small portion of my portfolio into very far OTM calls on UVXY.

Logic here is it's very cheap, and when markets crash, they crash fast. UVXY is a leveraged volatility fund. Options give me extra leverage.

I spend a few hundred a month on calls around 2-6 weeks out.

I look at it as an insurance policy.

Every month there's not a crash, I lose a few hundred or thousand.

When there is a crash, I may lose a lot on my stock holdings, but the insurence policy of far OTM UVXY calls will payout potentially over 100X that months premiums (assuming no counter party risk for the derivatives contracts in the fund or if there is a counter party failure I end up the end recipient of a govt/fed bailout)"

My strategy is pretty simple -- don't go all in on any one thing, and don't go all in at any one time. Been buying steadily and gradually across a variety of sectors and will keep doing so on down days, up days, flat days, and intend to hold most of my portfolio long-term.

On the rare 'gambles' I set automatic points to sell and take my profit, or sell and stop my loss.

Markets will go up, markets will go down. As long as you don't blow your whole load on one thing and/or at one moment, and you make sure you can afford to have your $ parked medium / long term and aren't forced to liquidate at any one given time, then you'll be fine.

If for some reason the markets are *not* fine long term -- perpetual bear market, multi-market collapse, hyperinflation or economic failure -- then you have bigger problems to worry about than your portfolio performance."

Heck even JNJ trades for 5x sales and thats high but its nothing compared with others out there. The conservatively priced businesses may lose 50% while the guys holding stocks priced like they walk on water will lose 80-99%. The dollar might not be safe. Gold may be a nice place.

- Right now we are seeing the inflation caused by the crazy amounts of money that was printed in 2020. In essence the prices of everything is going way up.
- The housing bubble. People are buying property like crazy. My house is worth double what I paid for it rn. 
- Gas prices. When gas prices go up it drives the prices of everything up.
- Lumber prices have quadrupled, this is inflating the housing bubble even further
- Computer chip shortage. Due to ports being closed or understaffed all of 2020 we are running out of computer chips. This drives up the price of anything computer related, notably automobiles.
- The economy is already stretched to its limits from Covid shut downs last year.


At what point will people just run out of the money to purchase overpriced goods? I see a lot of borrowing happening right now and that's only going to sustain us for so long until the bills are left unpaid. That will be when we see the businesses fail and layoffs begin. Is a collapse going to happen? Probably. It looks a lot like 2007 to me, minus the carefree lending. However if supply lines come back with a flood of oil and goods and lumber, we might see prices drop enough to sustain the economy."

The money feels wasted not earning anything just sitting there and then you think about inflation and it feels like it‚Äôs just getting diluted everyday. Selling covered calls and cash secured  puts is what I have been doing. That way I can make some extra money and if it happens to time with a drop in the market I can pick up shares at a discount.

I like sales. As for short to medium term money I have a good CD and efund in place so it's not like I am relying on this money to keep me afloat. Why would I put my emergency money in a place that isn't designed for it? That way I'm not panicking over this kind of stuff. I'm covered either way."

2021-06-30 00:49:39,stocks,"Yes, I think there will be a correction -- not a crash -- in the near future, and I'm preparing in two ways:

\- Holding steady. Most of my portfolio is based on strong fundamentals, so if anything takes a big hit, I'm confident I can just ride the wave.

\- Keeping a healthy savings account. Two reasons for this: If things get rough, I've made sure -- as sure as anyone reasonably can be -- that I don't have to liquidate any of my portfolio to take care of myself; then, if I'm doing okay, maybe I can average down on my favorite picks during the dip.

I don't have any stop losses set because, like the flash crash of 2010, any unpredictable, large-volume move could cause a cascade of quasi-automated volatility that snowballs over the market. (I'd hate to lose a bunch of money on a glorified glitch that corrects itself by the end of the week.) But that's just me, I'm pretty passive."

2021-06-30 04:44:01,stocks,"If you think a crash is coming, depending on your risk tolerance and investment style, you will react differently. for example:

**A very cautious investor** would sell and wait, eliminating his or her upside potential but also eliminating any risk of loss. This person may miss out on several green days while waiting for a crash. on the other hand, if a crash was to come soon, they will not lose any money.

**a cautiously optimistic investor**, one which is willing to take a chance, will hedge their bets. they will build their cash reserves in preparation- so that they can load up the truck full of great businesses selling at a discount! This investor is optimistic that a crash is not likely to happen and so is willing to continue buying at the same time. best of both worlds. This investor may not make amazing returns as they are investing less money in the market, however when a crash does happen, they have a cash reserve to load up, and thus lower their average cost by a decent margin. possibly pushing returns even higher than if they were to continue buying at the top like a fully optimistic investor would do.

**A very optimistic investor** will continue buying no matter what. They do not believe a crash is coming, they may be right, they may generate amazing returns, but these returns come at a risk. if a crash does happen it will wipe most of this investors gains.

Any company having a trashy buzzword (blockchain, cannabis, biotech, whatever) in it, get‚Äòs IPO‚Äòed by some shady M&A boutique. Then they get shilled on Reddit and will finally bust.

Then there is the hype beast Tesla. 
With the major automakers releasing what I believe to be a better product and is cheaper with a strong back bone of repair/service supply, I just don‚Äôt see the value in Tesla and that bubble is waaaaaaaay too big. Tesla has made no attempts to enter the fleet vehicle market and that is where I believe the EV battle will be won.

Either the United States will self-destruct in which case you won't need any money, or the market will rebound like it always has in tbe past. That being said this is a good opportunity to take $30,000 and turn it into $3 million with the proper investments by buying at the lowest point in the crash."

2021-06-30 08:00:58,stocks,"A crash?  No, dips, yes!   When the Fed speaks of tightening we will get a dip as it ultimately slows business growth so the market adjusts.  Now if we get run away inflation and the Fed is chasing it, then the dip gets much deeper.  If we reach an inability to manage inflation then the market correction becomes more severe and might be called a crash.  If your investment perspective is daily or hourly, then any dip feels like a crash. If your investment perspective is 6 months or longer then dips can be buying opportunities.  If you feel panic, then your judgement will be clouded, increase your time perspective and see if the panic level diminishes.  Dips are good ways to panic investors out of positions at a loss.  Learning to weather the storm is an acquired skill.  Have a little cash to buy the dips and relax."

One of the biggest mistakes you can make is to try and read the tea leaves to either time or predict the market.  True crashes are somethin that is impossible to actually predict in my book.  You may be able to predict small corrections and dips but not a crash, by their very nature crashes are so outside the norm that they are opaque in both timing and scope."

You see where I am going with this. Why would we have a crash 2 years in a row? 

Nothing is impossible but unless there is some major global event we most likely will not have a crash this year. 

I would expect a nice healthy correction but who knows when."

2021-06-30 10:49:47,stocks,"Honestly? I'm doing nothing. Picking which stocks will do poorly is just as hard as picking which stocks will do well. And if you (the generic you) are in danger of being in a bad place financially due to a stock market crash, then you need more money in savings and less in the market.

IMO the best thing to do, always, is regularly set aside a bit of your income into savings, then, once you have enough savings to survive an emergency, switch to index funds, and never look at it.

A stop loss is just guaranteeing that you will sell at a lower price if you do sell. If you really want to make sure you get cash, sell while it's high."

This would ripple to the stocks. Also for me there is inflation concerns too. I plan to not sell and probably try and invest more into this dip.

2021-06-30 11:18:12,stocks,"Yup, people always afraid of a crash. I'll give you my personal example.

I was investing from 2013 to 2016 a bunch, good times, but by 2017 I was like man this shits gotta crash at some point, 2018 had hiccups but it wasn't until 2020 that it actually crashed. Crashes are *rare* gradual descents or stagnant growth is much more common and and can be just as bad.

Really any new investors should worry about **what they invest in** rather then any market crashes.

Edit: FTR I had a lot of my money on the sidelines before 2020 because of that mentality I had and when it crashed I was super confident, I knew it was rare and would recover and went all in. But I missed out on opportunity with that cash while I was hesitant for years, I actually used a bunch on my mortgage to get it down and refinance because I was scared of the market."

At least in my area, it is completely out of whack and standing on last leg pumped up by investors and speculators, and way out of reach of ""real"" buyers.  It's a matter of time before big investors realize they are just throwing money just outbidding each other. By the time they decide to sell, they will realize there aren't any actual buyers at prices they bought for, because people looking for actual homes don't have incomes necessary to pay this much. Might as well sell home while you can at the peak and buy diversified non-housing stocks, then buy a nicer one once housing inevitably corrects. It's a gamble either way, but stock market definitely looks way healthier in comparison."

I'm looking to diversify a bit as well but looking at housing prices today is absolute insanity. I do think It will take several years for supply to catch up to demand, but like anything there will end up being more supply at some point."

I'm coming to the conclusion that the demand for houses in the middle of the country will continue to increase until populations decline significantly or something worse happens to cull the migrating herd.

In my area it's all corporate investors buying up properties. These investors aren't flippers; they're turning the houses into rentals, which removes the houses from the market entirely forever. This creates less supply for increasing demand. 

Basically, you've said that housing is a ""bubble"" while (correctly) explaining why it's actually not a bubble.

Except no one knows where the peak is. What if it keeps growing for another decade? Selling now could be a disaster as you'd be stuck renting and then, if you get sick of waiting for the correction that never comes, you then have to start all over, a higher entry cost.

Imagine selling your $250k home for like $450k, paying $1.5k/month rent for the next 5 years ($90k), and then buying a much worse house than what you had 5 years ago for like $350k because that's all you can afford now, and your old place is worth like $600k at this point. lol"

It's the morons that didn't have a clue what money was and where it came from that seem to be working minimum wage jobs.

2021-06-29 20:00:39,stocks,I believe that this inflation is transitory. With the chip shortage and supply chain issues it just comes down to simple supply and demand. And the fact that the country is opening up faster then inspected is putting more pressure on the demand side. Prices will naturally go up.  Commodity prices are already trending down. The major problem is going to be that china has a 16 week backlog factory to port.

2021-06-30 10:07:52,stocks,"Not really. People use leverage all the time. Some people get burned using margin. There's certainly lots of cautionary tales from using maxed out margin ratios, which will likely result in a margin call. People buy houses on massive leverage under the assumption that housing is a safe and stable asset. It could be a really good play to stay fully invested at all times and when incredible opportunities present themselves deploy a manageable amount of leverage to buy and deleverage progressively as the market recovers. The type of loan I'm talking about can't be margin called and I have a lot of contribution room so a deposit would result in a 30% rebate on my income taxes. These types of loans are issued at the prime interest rate."

I'm not talking theory.  I understand these thing in theory.  I'm lost in practice.  How does one put 1k a month into the market and have money to throw at good dips?  I can't see any way besides holding some back which sounds like trying to time the market."
2021-06-30 01:00:09,stocks,"If the motto is: ""time in the market is better than timing the market,"" than the logic should be, just DCA into whatever you believe in. In my case mostly b coins. So in order for me to buy more than I normally do in a week I would naturally have to sell high to buy during this crash. That is me inherently trying to time the market.

If I'm holding back cash then it's losing value and I'm waiting for a dip that might never come. Isn't that the whole theory about just being in the market? That you might lose but over a long enough time span you'll get ahead.

Maybe these are different groups but it seems long term investors both hold it's better to just always be in the market, don't bother trying to time it and also, buy the dip. I don't see how someone can do both."

2021-06-29 22:46:12,stocks,"The biggest risk that I can think of would be interest rates on your loan climbing (barring the entire economy falling over,  or something dodgy in your contract). This means that if you are taking out a loan to hedge against hyperinflation, you might want to look at a fixed rate loan. By doing this, you'll likely pay a premium (i.e. slightly higher interest rates than a floating or short-term fixed loan) and risk missing out on lower interest rates if they drop in the near-future, but if hyperinflation hits and interest rates skyrocket, you'll be golden.

You ""invited"" the big tech and you get what they bring with them - a cluster-fuck in the housing market. For them paying a million dollars for a house is the same as buying a cup of coffee for most Austin residents (paraphrasing).

A salary of $150,000 - $250,000 a year is not really a ""bragging right"" for tech employees here in SF/Silicon Valley and with that kind of income buying a half a million to a million dollars house in Austin is a walk in the park for them. So now real residents of Austin have to ""compete"" with these buyers.

I don't think Austin home values going anywhere except up-and-up for years to come.

Homeowners who are slightly overextended just to squeeze into something they aren't thrilled with just for the sake of ownership in 25 years are going to get very frustrated in a short time when they end up under water and having to stay in that house and ride out a downturn in the market. 

Meanwhile renters are going to be saving money and having a higher quality of life due to having disposable income. I can see plenty of keeping up with the Jones spending in the next 15 years or so, leading to excessive debt among home owners."

If spending resumes money will have to get sucked back which will cause a contraction on all of society's funds, businesses being the better shielded for it since they have sneaky ways of avoiding the tax man.

As far as i know the supply chain in semiconductors was bogged because the auto industry thought they wouldn't sell much last year so they cancelled orders, apple and others already had sizeable orders and some opted to increase their stock so ordered more than the usual. Then the auto industry changed their mind and a couple more minor things added up (drought in taiwan, china's nonsense, minor covid concerns and a fire at one of the tsmc factories) and that's what caused a ""back up"". 

TSMC and Intel both pledged big money to build more factories to prevent this, for some reason both in the same area in the US which feels dumb to me, and the possible concern there is we might be swimming in semiconductors in the future. Afaik even europe wanted to secure its supply by wanting to build a factory which was criticized by tsmc exactly due to supply potentially overrunning demand in 5 years if things spiral out of control.

As for travel? Some places yeah, people have begun to travel, others not so much. At least in Europe there's a checkerboard of countries which barely have any vaccination progress while others are doing good.

I don't know if the economy is booming but Amazon definitely is. I'm unconvinced the middle class in America is doing any better since the pandemic began. If that goes, having big corporations declare huge profits doesn't really point to a healthy economy."

Second, yeah what you asked was a very valid question. I don't do DCA, but I may buy more individual stock during crashes vs ETF's/MTF's, etc as I realize for individual stocks of certain brands there's a high chance of rebounds. I may also go the more selective route vs hands off more than usual to try and maximize. Maybe some folks put off money towards certain categories in their budgets to allocate more towards investments during these times. 

Not because they don't already believe in investing, but because they realize there's a high chance of rebound and thus it can be worth putting off money towards certain things in favor of investing now (think if someone had a goal of paying house off sooner so they pay more towards a mortgage. Maybe they just pay the minimum and put the extra towards investments). 

Keep in mind people's age group as well. Folks aren't likely to be so aggressive the older they get. Chances are they will already be in a good position by a certain age and thus don't necessarily need to be doing anything past some of traditional buy and hold stuff. Others may just have variations they make to either strategy that you use for personal reasons.

You also have to understand that there's a lag in cause and effect.   You shoot someone with a bullet, the lag is in fractions of a second.   A hedge fund collapses in Japan and it can take months (or longer) for the effects to ripple through as its assets are liquidated.

For example Trump grabs women by their genitals and thinks that's ok, Biden/Harris think that setting buildings on fire is peaceful. Trump tells people to drink bleach to cure Rona, Biden/Harris think that idiots storming the capitol with no weapons in sight is an insurrection (despite how setting buildings on fire somehow is peaceful). Trump thinks that Rona is made by the Chinese  because he wants that to be true, Biden/Harris/democrats/MSM say that's not true because they want it to not be true and then also say that's true because now that Trump is out that's ok. You see: it's all idiots all around.

So... to sum up I think there are loads of idiots in the world and it's quite likely from some perspective you and I are also idiots in some way we don't realize.

Another point to look into is this fear of the silver tsunami (boomers retiring). People are convinced that boomers will sell their stocks after they retire in the near future and stocks will take a dive. Because boomers have held the leadership positions for so long and worked into their 70s, gen xers were largely blocked from taking high paying jobs. Now, the silver tsunami is causing an exodus of leadership and Melleinials are filling the void. That is important because Melleinials save a much larger percentage of their pay than previous generations (apparently, entering the work force during a recession makes you frugal AF), and more importantly, they but stock with it *and* they hold it. Melleinials are much more financially savvy than previous generations. 

That being said, me thinks you will see a much higher PE ratio compared to historicals and it will be sustained for the next 20-40 years."

I have no other outstanding debt. This would result in a 3k tax return which I could put on the loan or buy more stock with. 

My point is to never hold cash because you almost always lose by doing that. But when the opportunity comes, I will continue to DCA as I always do but I personally will be considering buying using a manageable amount of leverage because with a leg down like that there is far less downside than upside at that point.

The point I want to make is that nothing is free and while some costs/risks are low or negligible one shouldn't forget that they exist entirely because they could go up. Maintenance is low now, but could conceivably go up in the future.

Right now, I think the highest risk is that related to the cost of financing going up which would in turn affect the market value of properties in the long run, including their rent-generating potential.

It's true that people need houses and demand is very inelastic. But if financing becomes out of reach that will simply force people to be creative about their living arrangements and will impact prices directly - unless the Fed will start buying houses too."

To be clear, I am saying he is delivering really bad, scary news, and not ""bad information"".

To summarize that particular book, he describes currency and the cycles of currencies and empires. The video kind of covers the debt cycle, but in the book he goes into more detail. His coverage spans thousands of years of history. Both currency and empires are intertwined. His DD is that they are cyclical. He describes their rise and their fall as well as the reasons for both. Based on his data, he feels that it is natural for currencies to be destroyed. It's just part of the cycle of empires. If you want to know why I feel that his book is in the horror genre, you should read the book. The 4th Turning is similar from the sociological POV, but it comes to a similar conclusion ie It's not the end of the world, but it will feel like it.

With the transaction costs of moving, ability to work wherever, etc. it's fair to say that there may not need to be a need for homeownership for a lot of people in the future. Getting a 30 year mortgage and actually staying in the house to pay it off like our grandparents did just doesnt happen as much. More renting may inherently not be a terrible idea.

Same for 2020 so far - overall rate of return of 8% so far with all the highs and lows and covid. But if you sold early to try to time a covid crash, keep some cash to buy low, and missed out on the 10 best days so far? -39%

That doesn‚Äôt even include the opportunity cost of holding cash trying to time a crash while everything goes up. You could still be trying to time that covid crash for all I know. That wouldn‚Äôt have worked out great.

I also understand they may not always hit their 2x or 3x goal or whatever it is and have higher expense ratios. 

However, if the benchmark is pretty stable, SP500 or Nasdaq for example, why wouldn‚Äôt one want to buy and hold a leveraged ETF longer term? Even if it doesn‚Äôt hit a 3x goal, wouldn‚Äôt it still be more profitable than its tracked fund? 

Take QQQ and TQQQ (3x leveraged) for an example. QQQ is up 241% over the past 5 years. TQQQ is up 1,592% in the same time. 

Or SPY which is up 112% over 5 years and SPXL (3x) 440%. 

I need someone to explain to me please why it‚Äôs a bad idea to bug and hold a product like TQQQ or SPXL because what I read when I Google it doesn‚Äôt seem to apply to funds like these."
2021-06-30 05:22:33,stocks,"Disclaimer: TQQQ is half my portfolio. I'm up almost 40% on these now.

I'm actually convinced that for a lot of people who is willing to manage your portfolio a little bit, holding these instead of its non-leveraged equivalent is better (maybe not TQQQ but UPRO/SPXL definitely). It's obviously more risky and much more volatile, but if your risk tolerance is up for it, I see no reason why not. It's free extra money and unless you're a experienced day trader, it would be hard to beat these especially over long periods because these really outperforms when you left it for that long. Now, I'm fully aware that 2001/2008 levels of crash will crush these, and it's exactly what I'm betting against."

2021-06-29 20:29:02,stocks,"You have to have a realistic short-term tolerance for fluctuations, and you have to have enough understanding of the company to know when dips are caused by ""material changes to the trajectory of the company's business performance"" vs when the dips are in concert w/ the broader markets, part of regular ebbs and flows, or in response to FUD or some other form of insignificant or inaccurate headlines. 

I'm more than 10% into three different individual stocks. For all three stocks, I know exactly what to expect in terms of earnings releases over the rest of the year, and I know what business development and catalyst milestones I'm looking for. 

For one of those three stocks, it's been red by as much as $10K. I kept buying the dip, because I was able to decipher what was driving the pullback and decided those reasons are crap and I want to keep averaging down. Just in the last few days, it has gained almost 15% over its lowpoint, and thanks to averaging down, I'm only 15% more from my break-even point, and the company still stands 100% on track with my expectations. 

If you can follow a company that close with that understanding of what drives its current price and future trajectory, then 15% isn't too much at all. It's more like just enough."
2021-06-29 21:10:04,stocks,"Depends on how safe you think the company is.  I like to think of diversification & allocation as some way to play with odds.

2021-06-29 20:57:53,stocks,"I think people continually forget that Intel pushed SSD & NAND technology forward for a decade. Intel isn't all eggs in the CPU basket, nor is AMD.   


Did Intel fail to innovate on their x86 platform? Yes. But x86 started hitting the heat wall in the early 2000s, and it took AMD a really long time to innovate in that tech space. Maybe it really was a strategic business decision, and they took it because AMD made a horrible move with bulldozer. Intel definitely has floundered. But as someone fortunate enough to have both a Haswell-E build and a Zen3 build, for general computer purposes, I honestly didn't notice the differences between the CPUs as much as benchmarks seem to indicate I should. Granted, both are overclocked with some serious cooling solutions. In my experience, I think this really just shows the issues with the x86 architecture. Again, just my  2 cents."

No proof of that. There are multiple competing CPU makers, and any deal will require them to continue licensing ARM to whoever has it

Just listing a bunch of tech-marketing bullets doesn't make a tech market magically expand.

It's not like there will be a sudden flood of new applications. The modules available have included CPUs for decades. AMD isn't bringing anything new.

AMD already did custom solutions. This competes with that. It feels like they were tired of losing design wins to Xilinx and decided to solve that problem."

In the short term, the market is a voting machine. Supply and demand. In the long term, it is a weighing machine, and my point stands just fine, I think. I‚Äôm the long term, the return of the company has very little to do with the market and everything to do with its actual commercial performance. 

If a company is valued at more than your expectation of its discounted future cash flows, when you buy that company, you either a) expect to hold onto it long term and expect to lose money b) you expect to get out of it in the short or medium term and leave someone holding the bag c) you expect market irrationality to continue indefinitely. 

I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre saying a) or b), I think you‚Äôre saying c). If so, you‚Äôre in for a shock"

If she sold her 2M house today, paid off the remaining principle plus interest, she‚Äôd probably net in the 1.5-1.7M range.  

That‚Äôs way more than a 320 percent return on a 120K initial investment.  Property taxes, insurance, maintenance/capital improvements will bring this number down, but there‚Äôs a good chance it still outperforms the broad based market.

You have to remember that real estate is usually a leveraged investment that can really kick up return rates in white hot markets like California."
2021-06-30 06:31:54,stocks,You also needed to pick the right place to buy that house.
2021-06-29 20:39:18,stocks,120k can't buy a 600k house. You have to pay interest every month. And you can get leverage in a margin account or with buying options. So it's not such a simple comparison.
2021-06-29 20:43:29,stocks,It is totally possible to average a 50% gain over 10 years by investing. You just need to have an aggressive portfolio.
2021-06-30 05:52:17,stocks,"It's not true that if the internal rate of return is negative based on *the most optimistic analyst's expectation*, that you will lose money. Your claim is now that analysts can always predict future earnings. Analysts have been very wrong at times."
2021-06-30 14:18:56,stocks,"> expectation of its discounted future cash flows

How much into the future? I'm saying d) because there aren't many alternatives to stocks anymore (except for real estate), people are willing to look further into the future. So yes, demand will stay high for far longer than it has in the past. Will prices go too high and is there a correction coming? Of course. There always is eventually. But my guess is that the correction is not going to get prices back to what you would call rational. I think we are entering a new era of markets where P/E ratios will be sustainably much higher than in the past. Never before in the past were there this many retail investors and that number is only going to go up. Every year more and more average folks are spending on stocks instead of buying a new car. This permanently changes things with an increased demand.

Also what everyone thinks is that they are picking the next Amazon or Netflix. Some of them will be right. And in hindsight there was nothing irrational about buying Amazon when it's P/E ratio in 2012 was over 3000 but you could snatch the stock for a beautiful 1/10th of its current price. You could hardly call that gambling type speculation or that current stock holders have been left holding the bag. People guessed right that Amazon would change the world and profit hugely from it."
2021-06-30 09:06:54,stocks,"Hard disagree.  You need to know if you underperformed or outperformed over a given benchmark.  You should generally view the S&P 500 as your benchmark return rate for capital deployment.  Comparing an investment to this helps gauge its success.  It‚Äôs a valuable way to calculate opportunity cost over a long period.  If you underperformed an average market return over a 10 year period, you shouldn‚Äôt be thrilled.  

Comparing an investment to the return of a random stock is dumb (I.e. those insane articles titled: ‚Äúif you invested $1000 in XXX stock 2010‚Ä¶‚Äù).  Looking at that in a vacuum, you may assume you really missed out, however if your benchmark average return actually returned more, then you didn‚Äôt.  If I invested $1000 in <risky tech stock> and returns 250% over 10 years, I may think I‚Äôm a genius.  However, if the market returns over 300%, my risk-adjusted return severely underperformed. 

A caveat to this: Diversification is important, so comparing returns across asset classes is difficult.  Having real estate in a portfolio doesn‚Äôt make it a bad investment just because it doesn‚Äôt return as much as the market average over a given period.  Same with gold or bonds.  However, the average market return is still a valuable way to gauge the success of your total deployment of capital on a risk-adjusted basis."
2021-06-30 06:31:00,stocks,California being a white hot market has the benefit of hindsight. What about all the people who bought in a housing market that has underperformed?

2021-06-30 13:37:58,stocks,"Ok true. Amended as follows to remove that, my point still stands. 

It is objectively true that if the internal rate of return is negative on a stock purchase vs *your own* most optimistic expectations of future cash flows associated with that company, *you expect* that will not make money on it in the long run. You are left with short term speculation as your only means to make profit."
2021-06-30 16:42:36,stocks,"Cash flows would be discounted to infinity. This doesn‚Äôt add as much as you would think as the terminal value can be lower than you might think due to what is effectively reverse-compounding. 

To your point about permanently high multiples, this situation isn‚Äôt new. Japan has been where we are before, in the 80s. Their stock market reached sky high p/es. It crashed in 1989 and it *still hasn‚Äôt recovered*."

I accept your point about M1 chips, but apart from that everything else that you listed: apple is not leading the industry in any of those even if they did pioneer it. Also what we are talking about it what apple has done and not what apple ia going to do. If they do come up with a search engine that can beat google in its quality or a self driving car that can beat waymo. I'll change my POV."
2021-06-30 12:15:07,stocks,"Its not UI. Its engineering design. The iPhone 4 is without a doubt the most groundbreaking technology that has faced the web since the web. It singlehandedly accelerated the idea of a smartphone, to the point where smartphones are now more common than PCs and every web company now caters to them more as they own more of the web share.

Even if you disagree on that, I just listed their technological innovations (multitouch control, ultra thin shells for laptops, Webkit browser engine, AR/VR universal API, an entire new subdivison of computing (tablets), gesture control, secure enclave, Siri, FindMy, global Tor, ResearchKit to aid medical research)

M1 is an example of engineering design. There's no scientific breakthrough with it, just clever engineering design.

>apple is not leading the industry in any of those even if they did pioneer it.

??

Last I checked Apple are the number 1 smartphone maker by revenue. They are the number 1 tablet maker by revenue and sales. They are the number 1 smartwatch maker by a country mile. Number 1 app store by revenue, almost double Google's.

They have an insane 66% marketshare in the US, 75% of US App store revenue and 80% of time spent on the Internet. Even crazier is that they are still growing. LG has dropped out, Google's hardware is a flop, Samsung is losing ground to Apple in the Western markets.

There's a reason why so many tech companies follow what Apple does and why even the biggest tech companies, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon cannot out leverage Apple. Google pays Apple $10B in straight cash just to be their default browser. 43% of Facebook's business comes from the US. 66% for Amazon.

The smartphone was the next evolution in human computer interaction, and if we're talking about making money on that then you have to go through Apple. Whats the next evolution? AR/VR (the pieces are slowly coming into place, appclips, findmy, apple watch gesture control, apple indoor maps, lidar screening, powerful small chips, better Siri needed) , wearables with gesture control (Apple watch already does this), and the car."
2021-06-30 12:34:48,stocks,"By saying that apple is not a market leader in the things you mentioned.. i didnt mean the devices.. i meant AR,VR, Siri, etc.. the ""innovations"" by apple as you put it."
2021-06-30 15:16:27,stocks,"And you'd be wrong again. AR/VR Kit is one the best AR/VR APIs for developers, and I can safely bet that an Apple AR device is going to be a lot more popular than a Google, Facebook or Amazon one.

Siri was the first voice assistant on a phone, and unlike Google or Amazon, user privacy is more important than mass data collection. Hence why Siri is more limited but is also more private and can run locally. 

What's next? Webkit browser engine is what Google and Microsoft use lol. RsearchKit is miles ahead of an Android equivalent. 

I think its pretty clear that you simply aren't that knowledgeable on how dominant and respected Apple are in the software dev and web industry."
2021-06-30 15:17:07,stocks,Ok
2021-06-30 15:28:17,stocks,"Arkit for apple will always be dominated by apple because its their fuckin ecosystem, they will always have an edge.

If we leave things that steve started, then there are very less things to point out as true innovation (again, not zero). Apple's innovation now is nothing compared to what other companies are doing.

Perhaps you are referring to the fact that many type II diabetics eventually become unable to secrete insulin (which is more ""Type I-like""), but by that time, teplizumab would likely not be beneficial (see next comment)  Second, a quick look at how teplizumab works shows that it would have be given to newly diagnosed patients, or those very early in the progression of their disease.  Therefore, it would not be useful in most of the 1.4 million or so currently diagnosed patients--only those very early in the disease process, and any newly diagnosed.  If you are a pharmacist, you should know this.  It is an interesting drug and a potential game changer for newly diagnosed type I patients."
2021-06-30 07:23:54,stocks,"I‚Äôm not sure where to begin???????? Those stats I mentioned were CDC data on‚Ä¶type 1 diabetes incidence, not prevalence in the US‚Ä¶.We are finding out that more adults getting diabetes are actually‚Ä¶.Type 1 diabetics and not type 2. Secondly, those numbers were incidence of type 1 diabetes in one year. This year will likely result in a similar incidence rate. And the next year and the next year after that. The biggest change to how it‚Äôs used would be screening for those about to show symptoms for T1D because much of the early progression is asymptomatic  and it would be most effective given before our body destroys much of the insulin secreting cells. So thank you for the useless criticism"
2021-06-30 11:03:42,stocks,"From the 2020 CDC report:  

Incidence Among Children and Adolescents  
Data from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study indicated that during 2014‚Äì2015, the estimated annual number of newly diagnosed cases in the United States included:  
‚Ä¢ 18,291 children and adolescents younger than age 20 years with type 1 diabetes.  
‚Ä¢ 5,758 children and adolescents age 10 to 19 years with type 2 diabetes.

The numbers you originally posted are indeed the prevalence of Type 1, not incidence.

Also from the CDC:

The most common of diabetes is type 2. According to the CDC, 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes in the United States have type 2. Just 5 percent of people have type 1.

Would suggest everyone carefully read the CDC report.

Completely agree with your next to last sentence, but will be difficult since about 7 million with diabetes are undiagnosed......definitely need to work on diagnosing earlier.

Sorry that you find discussion/challenge useless.  Again, I think it is an intersting drug and potential game changer for patients with Type 1, providing the health care community gets better at early diagnosis."

2021-06-29 23:30:00,stocks,"I dont know how to do the quotes thing in reddit but in response to this part... ""Also if the economy collapses, everyone will attempt to take their gold out of the ETF or sell it,thus plummeting the price of the stock.""

ETFs work by arbitrage, if the market price (MP) differs too much from the net asset value (NAV) then the distributor/manager will buy or sell more shares to bring equilibrium to the stock price.  It's why the SEC requires ETFs to show standardized performance for ETFs to have market value and NAV pricing.  So, basically if the underlying holdings (NAV) are always going up (gold price increasing) then the etf (MP) will always go up - Market price will attempt to achieve NAV...  Highly recommend researching arbitrage if you are bored, its actually kind of interesting.  

Commodities are extremely volatile.  So much so that it is literally required on every marketing piece for a commodity security to include the line ""Commodities generally are volatile and are not suitable for all investors.""  No other investment class needs that disclosure."

2021-06-29 21:37:14,stocks,"hard disagree

Where are you getting that interest rates are increasing soon?  The fed has remained steadfast that they are not increasing rates.

Not trying to be a dick or anything, but ive been having these discussions with bears for the past 4 months.  Ive been told repeatedly that the market is overvalued and that we were at the top and yet new ATHs keep getting hit. And any ""correction"" is minor and fleeting at best.

The fact of the matter is that COVID cases are decreasing and everything is opening back up.  Americans are at a 50 year high in savings and are biting at the bit to get out there and spend. Unemployment is decreasing and companies are hiring like crazy.  Companies (largely tech) are posting record breaking quarter after record breaking quarter. The fed has kept interest rates at 0%.  

When you combine all these factors together what you get is what we have been seeing the past 3 months...a bull market.  I have yet to see any indications that its over or slowing down.  I think in the next 6 months we will easily see 5% gains in the major indexes.  But like you said...who the hell knows"

2021-06-30 05:17:41,stocks,"I thought about this and let's look at a few things.

Cash to debt. Msft's debt is covered by cash flow 125.2%. 58 billion debt. 134billion equality so it has great financial strength.

Msft gross profit margins 2016-2020 are 65%. 2021 3rd quarter revenue is 41.7 billion.  High profit margin companies are typically safe.

Annual revenue growth is 19%

Return on investment is 21.1%

It is the only other company to have a triple A rated stock with higher credit rating than the US government.

So tell me which part of any of that tells you msft is a bad deal? I am making far more consistently with msft than anything else. I don't see why I would take out considering all known data."
2021-06-30 07:42:28,stocks,"I think you missed the point a bit, MSFT is a great company and I'd love to invest in it. The financials you just laid out are some of the reasons. But it's trading at a 37 PE and over 40x free cash flow. If you're happy paying 40x free cash flow that is fine, but you've got to understand how incredibly high that is for a company that is so large it can't continue to grow exponentially (Revenue growth has been decreasing for the last 5 years). 20x would be a reasonable number based on the numbers you laid out.

A channel called Everything money made a great video about it a few days ago if you're interested. 

I don't think msft is a bad investment but this subreddit has a hard on for it lately and just ignore the fact it has a 2T marketcap and is trading at way higher multiples than it was a few years ago with less growth potential."

Of course, $65k is far, far away from ‚Äúwell over $100k‚Äù and still $10k less than what is ‚Äúpretty typical‚Äù

So again, genuinely curious where you work. I‚Äôm in Denver, a major metro area, on par with California for cost of living but with 1/2 the pay generally (under 1/3 compared to Silicon Valley) so I‚Äôm sure your company has an office here.

2021-06-30 18:54:03,stocks,"A share in a company is a share in the current assets and future profits

A stock can be compared to a bond. A bond pays a known amount of money in the future (plus some risk of default) and often has a fixed end date while a stock pays an unknown amount of money in the future, indefinitely (plus some risk of bankruptcy).  

For a stock past performance only matters to the extent that it hasn‚Äôt been withdrawn though dividends and buybacks (so has a surplus of assets in the bank so to speak) and that good past performance suggests future good performance.  This is why a good earnings report for a stock that puts cash in the bank can be negative for stock price if it wasn‚Äôt good enough.  People estimate less future cash flows and are willing to pay less for the stock."

&#x200B;

You seem to confuse profitability with revenue. But that's OK; people come here and end up learning stuff.

Here are some good quotes: ""the company has been in the red the past three years""  They even lost millions in the 1st quarter of this year.  When they went private in 2016, they had $12 million in debt.  A few months ago, they had $1.2 \*billion\* in debt.  They aren't worth 4x what they were 4-5 years ago.

And see what our friends over at that other board have to say about it.
