6/30/2021 19:48,stocks,I hope your forecast is correct. I am the hole on it.
6/30/2021 18:51,stocks,Sounds like you're ready to ride the wheel.
6/30/2021 19:22,stocks,"Why not purchase the shares at current price and sell covered calls? I see what you’re saying in terms of “short term dip doesnt matter” but if your long term confidence is that high, just purchase the shares and sell covered calls. Much less interaction needed while initiating a steady stream of income. 

The reason puts are typically cash covered when shorted versus calls that can be covered via long calls/shares is that the risk/benefit just isn’t there; if the stock price drops both your underlying is worth less (any stocks you own), you have to provide liquidity, and you lost your premium.

Whereas with covered calls, if you get assigned you’ve collected the premium from the calls (which essentially you keep since its independent your shares), and your remaining underlying is worth more than it was when you sold the call. So if you wanted to repurchase the lot of shares you would have offset the cost by two ways."
6/30/2021 18:50,stocks,I’m totally confused .. you mentioned selling covered calls in the headline then referenced selling weekly puts. Lol
6/30/2021 18:51,stocks,"Other potential downside is if it absolutely crashes for some reason, you’ll be buying well above what it’s trading at. Fairly unlikely, not impossible."
6/30/2021 19:36,stocks,"Reddit killed my last comment.

Yes, writing naked OTM puts generates income for you while, if assigned, you get the stock cheaper than where it is today.

Note it's technically not the same as writing a covered call, even though the risk exposure is substantially the same."
6/30/2021 19:48,stocks,"I think what you've mentioned should work well, the problem would be if the stock drops a lot once you sold your puts or if it rockets up and you miss the train, this shit is always tricky. I honestly prefer to wait for a good entry point (wait maybe for a break-out) instead of selling puts. I have sold puts in a few occasions but basically when I miss my entry. For instance ... I had plan to buy ASTS this morning but it opened with a 30% gap so I was thinking to sold puts (end of July or August) in a way that the strike and premiun match with what I wanted to pay for the stock (in my case around $10). If ASTS goes up I will keep the premium and if it goes down I would be more than happy of beeing assigned.  Hope all this makes sense. Good luck"
6/30/2021 18:56,stocks,"I would sell covered calls on the underlying yes. However remember these are companies I am long no matter what, the covered calls would be FAR otm, I wouldn't want them to be assigned"
6/30/2021 18:55,stocks,"When shorting outs, the risk exposure is effectively the same as writing a covered call."
6/30/2021 18:57,stocks,"Oo shit your right, fuk. Damn wish I could edit title. 

Yes, I meant cash secured puts"
6/30/2021 18:58,stocks,But my thing is wouldn't i already be screwed anyways. I was going to buy the stock at current price anyways. This would at least give me the small pittance of premium
6/30/2021 18:58,stocks,How so? Writing a covered call is collecting a premium  on XYZ stock that you own. If you get assuaged then kiss that 100 shares good bye… shorting puts is unlimited risk. Am I missing something?
6/30/2021 19:09,stocks,You wouldn't buy at that price if there was terrible earnings or news about the company that you didn't know about beforehand.
6/30/2021 19:12,stocks,"I get your point. And I have done this very thing, I’m a fan. But If you had bought the 100 shares and it tanked, you could at least have had a stop loss preventing you from being totally screwed.  Just adding some more to think about."
6/30/2021 19:32,stocks,"Unlimited risk is a misnomer. It’s 100shares times the strike price of your put minus your premium collected. 

Ex. If you sell a put at a strike of $50 and collect a $2 premium. Your risk in the trade is 100 * $50 = $5000 minus your premium. So $4800 total. You’ll need to have that capital in your account or risk getting margin called. 

After that the stock can zero out (drop to nothing) and sure, that’s a big loss. 

And to your mention of CCs … maybe look up the wheel strategy. You’re half way there. 

Disclaimer. I’m new to this myself and welcome corrections if I am in error."
6/30/2021 19:50,stocks,A short put is synthetically identical to owning 100 shares and selling a covered call with the same strike.
6/30/2021 19:12,stocks,"Ok but the example is either I buy the 100 shares outright today, or I sell cash covered puts until assigned. 

So if there was terrible earnings, id already feel downswing either way"
6/30/2021 19:22,stocks,"Oo yeah I'm not a stop loss guy. If I buy i don't plan on selling for a long time no matter what. I've checked and it looks like I could just write them at the money and make about 1% a week until assigned, and when assigned getting a .5% discount. Nothing major but seems like a free percent or two"
6/30/2021 19:33,stocks,Are you two going to go back and forth for the next 6 hours now?
6/30/2021 18:24,stocks,Hyperinflation doesn't work like that when one day dollar loses 50% value and then everything is stable again tomorrow. Any company that cannot immediately get rid of cash for something else valuable is dead.
6/30/2021 18:27,stocks,I am from Bulgaria we had 2 hyperinflations from USSR to democracy believe me u don’t want to live in a country with hyperinflation. The money gets no value. And believe me the stocks will be your last worry 😂
6/30/2021 18:24,stocks,"Yep, inflation mascarading as earnings."
6/30/2021 18:26,stocks,"No, because market is forward looking right.

So, the answer to rising inflation is higher interest rate.

Higher interest rate mean that the debt is now more expensive, the money is no longer cheap. Also future earnings are discounted even more. That would drag down the valuation, and trigger the correction.

Why do you need to raise rates to battle inflation? 

No economy can really thrive in hyperinflation, whole system kinda collapse. So inflation is feared not because of the inflation per see (looking strictly from price perspective) but because the natural answer are higher rates.

Second point, the company that is doing well under inflation is the one who can transfer the cost to the consumer... growth companies that can do that 10y from now usually underperform in inflation environment."
6/30/2021 19:55,stocks,"Really interested in your personal experience with hyperinflation during USSR. If you don’t mind me asking.

What were your biggest worries? How could someone prepare for it?"
6/30/2021 18:40,stocks,Did you know the Robin Hood CEO in Bulgaria?
6/30/2021 18:44,stocks,Usually essential companies make the most of it during inflation just to add it ( from personal experience and expenses 😀)

6/30/2021 17:17,stocks,“Often the best stock is one you already own”
6/30/2021 17:38,stocks,"For my smaller sized portfolio I believe small and concentrated with 5-7 high conviction picks is better than 10-12+ with lower conviction speculative stuff. When I go for a bunch of companies and just a few of the picks fail, it really eats away at overall returns. 

But I do know pretty much anything speculative got ripped a new one this year, and I’m holding on to hope with some of my biotech stuff. 

I know a few people who basically just toss in a share of a blue chip like AAPL every paycheck and I think that’s pretty smart. 1/3rd of my portfolio is basically just AMD and I’m pretty stoked about that right now."
6/30/2021 17:32,stocks,"It depends on your risk levels and how convinced you are with your picks. The more different stocks = less risky (not putting all your eggs in few baskets). But I know some people are very convinced with their picks and waiting for certain catalyst, so returns can get higher with fewer stocks."
6/30/2021 17:41,stocks,"Each additional stock you add increases diversification which reduces risk. Stocks that are in the same sector are likely to be more correlated with each other than those in different sector.

6/30/2021 17:47,stocks,"If you think stocks you currently own are still undervalued and will likely increase in value more, then you can add more.

It does not hurt to research other stocks. You may find a better deal which you can then buy or even sell stocks you own to buy if you think it's a better deal than current stocks in portfolio."

6/30/2021 17:23,stocks,">Why do the prices of these ETFs range from 50-400$ when they all have very similar holdings it seems

all that matters is NAV/shares outstanding which determines price, price is irrelevant since they'll move with their assets

> And why pay a higher expense ratio if again, the ETF is just going to have the same holdings as a cheaper ETF? Not a huge expense but .03-.06% was the range I saw.

if 2 etfs are exactly the same, go for lower er. this is why people hold voo instead of spy. voo has a lower er but spy has much better liquidity for trading"
6/30/2021 19:52,stocks,"Some of that is also just the less expensive shares being smaller portions of the overall pie. In theory your $50 etf could just be getting you 1/8 of what the $400 gets you with each company. If you have access to fractional shares it mostly doesn't matter. (If you have a DRIP set up, and your position is small, you want the cheaper one so your dividends are less likely to fall below the minimum division threshold for your broker)."
6/30/2021 19:59,stocks,Why do people still use spy? Liquidity could just be as good on voo if everyone switched to the lower cost etf right

The initial price to implement electric buses would be too high even if it saved money in the long run. Especially since they are run off public money.

6/30/2021 16:25,stocks,"It's not pundits that are saying inflation is transitory, its Jerome Powell and other members of the Fed

I agree with you, prices are high right now no denying that. Though IMO that is due to mostly due to disruptions stemming for the pandemic and ""base effects"" as prices recover from the collapse last year

As the economy continue to reopen, I expect the disruptions caused in the supply chain and labor market to lessen, and with saving-laden consumers finally emerging, I dont see higher prices as too much of a negative right now.

To be clear I am not saying inflation is not going on and by transitory it doesn't mean a few weeks or months. Higher Inflation will likely continue for at least the rest of the year. That said, I think it is very unlikely we are at the beginning of a problematic, multi-year inflationary cycle.

Moreover, after the SPY fell 4% in mid-May following panic after the release of the April Consumer Index, stocks have powered ahead despite more, higher than expected readings coming out since then. So I would say it is fair to say fears have tempered as of now"
6/30/2021 16:49,stocks,I think it will!
6/30/2021 16:31,stocks,"True, but it’s also in their interest to say that inflation is transitory, no? Otherwise no infrastructure bill, and market euphoria goes away quick. 

I can understand the argument on base effects, but only to an extent. When a drink and a burger at your local bar costs 20% more than last year, is that really a base effect? 

Anyway I’m not saying that they’re wrong, just that it seems premature considering as you say, the inflation numbers keep coming in hotter than expected. 

As for your comment on savings, I think people will splurge on travel for sure after so long indoors. In terms of consumables, I am less sure. Are you really going to spend more money just because you’ve saved more over the past year (keep in mind people like my wife also used and abused online shopping). I won’t, but I’m also cheap :)"
6/30/2021 16:46,stocks,"1. Im confused by what you mean by interests. The Fed has a dual mandate: maintaing inflation stable and maximum employment. Powell has consistently reiterated he sees current inflationary pressures being transitory and will wait for the labor market to imprive before doing any adjustments. Of course he isn't going to come out and say he thinks it's doom and gloom, that makes no sense. Also you know the infrastructure bill is in Congress, the Fed has absolutely nothing to do with that.

2. Food is a bad example to use given it's a staple and price is always volatile. This is why food and energy prices are not included in core inflationary readings. Inflation is measures year-over-year and during this time last year we were in the height of the pandemic and prices collapsed across the board. Now they are rebounding. Using your example (though it's not a very good one for the purpose of inflation) if the price of meat fell 20% last year last year, of course a burger would be worth 20% more comparatively now that it recovered.

3. It is simply a fact Americans today have a very high level of savings due to stimulus. Why would that money not be spent on goods and services? Consumer spending accounts 70% of consumer GDP. Using personal experience doesn't apply to macro trends."
6/30/2021 16:52,stocks,"Thanks for the reply.

1. The Fed is supposed to be independent, but in reality I don’t think it’s oblivious to politics. If inflation is not transitory, the likelihood of passing the infrastructure bill is not as strong.

2. Yeah you’re right it’s a bad example. But my point was that some of these price increases are here to stay. A bar likely didn’t decrease its prices last year, but likely they did increase their prices this year. And it’s not like they are going to reduce those in the future - they are here to stay. 

3. Fair enough"
6/30/2021 16:55,stocks,The Fed has been saying the same thing about inflationw wayyyyyy before the infrastructure bill was proposed. I don't see the connection here.
6/30/2021 17:13,stocks,"Didn’t the transitory comments from the Fed first come in March? Infrastructure proposal has been around for quite a while. I swear I remember seeing some Republicans on TV around that time saying that they were not keen on supporting a big package when inflation was heating up.

Anyway maybe I’m more skeptical than you, but I do find it hard to believe the Fed is truly impartial to outside influences."
6/30/2021 19:12,stocks,"Let's stick to talking about inflation, it was an interesting conversation. I fail to see what the infrastructure bill that has bipartisan support has anything to do with that.

This about stocks not politics"

6/30/2021 15:46,stocks,We are nobody’s can’t buy ipo at the prices others get them at
6/30/2021 15:51,stocks,"I’d generally advise against buying IPOs anyways, as those opening prices, and those shortly after, are often inflated.

Most IPOs drop after a few days or weeks. That’s not to say that they don’t rebound, but I’d never want to buy right away. Wish you could buy short puts, but you can’t."
6/30/2021 15:58,stocks,It's because nobody sold LZ at $28 or lower for your order to fill.
6/30/2021 16:04,stocks,"Stay away from IPOs if you dont know 100% what you're doing anyways.

I prefer to invest in companies with healthy balance sheets, low price/book ratio, and solid income statements. If they're a new company I want a year or two of financial statements. Also, I want to see the majority of their income come from operating activites) 

Also, the notes in the yearly 10k report are sometimes really helpful, especially if you know the industry. 


Don't worry about this missed order. Keep learning and investing smart.

If anyone spots an error please correct me, I'm still learning too!"
6/30/2021 15:57,stocks,Never traded there that was the ipo price. It was as low as 36$ as soon as trading commenced
6/30/2021 16:03,stocks,"Just because you want to buy for $28 doesn't mean someone is willing to sell it to you for $28. People generally stay away from IPO's because the price volatility gets insane and you don't want to get burned holding shares that you bought based on peer pressure. 

Think of stock investing like an auction. Someone wants to sell 1 share of Apple to a group of 30 buyers. The highest offer they receive is the one they will sell it to. Same with stocks when you break it down to a microscopic level. Your order wasn't filled because someone else either bought them at the price first or no one is selling it for the price you want it for."
6/30/2021 16:35,stocks,No one was willing to sell to you at the price you wanted.
6/30/2021 17:33,stocks,Yeah. Only the big whales can buy at initial pricing. By the time retail investors jump in. It’s usually 15-20% higher.
6/30/2021 18:14,stocks,"IPO volatility on the first day can be crazy depending on supply/demand. 
Demand was much higher than supply so it’s price skyrocketed past your limit price and since it never went below the buy never executed. 

Volatility ruined your trade."
6/30/2021 18:23,stocks,"You may notice in your Limit orders that sometimes, your orders execute partially.

For example, let’s say stock $XYZ is at $51, and you wanted 100 shares of it at $50. So you place your limit order of 100 @ $50, and you wait until it drops to your price point if it does. Well let’s say it does, and falls to $50, and you notice that maybe 75/100 shares were bought. Which means it’s still actively looking for 25 more shares to buy at $50.

This may be because the price of the stock returned to above $50 before your limit order could find enough buyers selling at $50.

For your limit order on the IPO, the $28 limit order was never executed because no one was selling any shares at that price. If you look at most IPO trends though, they have a huge leap in the initial offering for the first few days, but usually fall. So don’t feel like you missed out on anything, re-enter the position if you believe in the company. If you believe it’ll rise even higher than $36, then buy now."
6/30/2021 19:43,stocks,Only (you) was available for PRE IPO sales. Legal zoom and didi and dingdong were all released as just IPO. I really really really wish I had access to (cpop) PRE IPO

6/30/2021 18:18,stocks,Everyone here is missing the point. The only thing i can think of is to make sure it was a limit order and not a market order or some mix up setting up your order
6/30/2021 16:56,stocks,"I don't know enough about puts and calls, if those are even the terms.  Again, this is month 2 for me of actively trading, so I'm not going anywhere near options.  Maybe ever?"
6/30/2021 17:02,stocks,"Again, being 2 months old in the investing world, I figured if LZ was going public today at $28, and I put my bid in for $28, that when the market opened, the price would have started at $28 and not $36.  

So, I suppose the issue may have been that a lot of shares were bought pre-IPO at $24-$28, which was listed on NASDAQ, and whenever it opened up, no one was willing to sell at that price..."
6/30/2021 18:27,stocks,"I did, it's small amount so I'm not going to lose everything, but I believe LZ will grow."
6/30/2021 19:00,stocks,"Agree with Eddie, IPO’s generally tend to underperform for the first couple months. Usually an over reaction of people buying into them which artificially inflates the price. I would generally steer clear of IPOs for a year or so until they have had time to cool off and move away from volatility"
6/30/2021 19:47,stocks,"Yes but if everyone else put in a buy order for $36 or higher, why would they sell to you for $28?"
6/30/2021 19:12,stocks,"I wish I had an answer, not familiar with IPOs. Rather keep quiet than give wrong info out. 

Just wanted to offer some general advice that i wish I'd known when i started investing years ago.

And spreading out, for buys and sells. If no fortune teller is at hand, there you have a mathematical way of buying the bottom (partially) and selling the peak (partially too).

Sure you have some lost opportunities, I sold APPN at 10% gain at fucking 55$ cus I didn't want to keep checking the number; but alot of the random single digit stocks ended up being bad investments if i didn't know better.

6/30/2021 19:42,stocks,"I use the metric quite a lot and like you mentioned it's a de facto metric used in valuation. I agree EBITDA doesn't capture balance sheet quality & Capex, but the fundamental value of a company is based on the value of future free cash flows adjusted for time & risk. With that being said, the EV/EBITDA multiple used should capture that. 

For example holding everything constant using a company with high Capex needs with $100m in EBITDA will trade at a lower multiple compared to another company with low Capex needs with $100m in EBITDA."

As you said while it may not capture Capex perfectly you can always look at industry averages and the most common pairing is with EV, so it does take into account the cost of any debt financing."

6/30/2021 17:29,stocks,"Sell at least some of it. This isn’t a sector where growth like this could continue exponentially.

It’s okay to win. ✊️"
6/30/2021 14:54,stocks,Sell. Shits been trading sideways for a while now just wait g for something to send it spiraling downward
6/30/2021 14:00,stocks,I think you should take some gains. Good job.
6/30/2021 14:03,stocks,Do you need money now? Can you use that money somewhere else with better returns? If the answer is yes then sell or trim a little.
6/30/2021 15:20,stocks,"When I get massive gains in one stock what I typically do is sell enough to recover my initial investment and then leave the rest in the stock.  This basically makes the shares left over as free and you can reinvest the original amount in a better opportunity.  A win win.

For example if I bought 10 shares of stock A for $10 a share and now the stock is $15. I would sell around 7 shares get $105 and leave 3 shares as basically free stock."
6/30/2021 14:13,stocks,"If it was me I'd sell. The market is looking very shaky at the moment and lots of people posting research that suggests a crash is coming. That crash will wipe out your gains and put you in the red. Do your own research of course, it's your own money  just remain vigilant."
6/30/2021 14:20,stocks,"I'd sell half. Even if the wider market dips, airlines are still depressed so might not suffer as much/even grow. Or not. maybe business travelers realize they don't need to go in person and air travel never fully recovers. Sell half, research and think about a good place to ride out a broader storm for the rest. And put a little into something fun #yolo"
6/30/2021 15:23,stocks,"I made a mistake of selling many gains couple of weeks ago (before FED meeting). Most of those stocks are up 10% in less than two weeks and am regretting.

If you do not need money, I would not recommend SELL. If you believe in the companies, they will keep going up. Also I am not a financial advisor but I will never put money into Airlines. They rarely made money (before COVID) and there is no way on earth that travel will go back to normal for a long time. Especially Business (where most of airlines made the money)"
6/30/2021 14:18,stocks,Much appreciated

6/30/2021 14:37,stocks,"My question is what does sofi do better than anyone else that makes them a real competitor in any space they are in, diversification isn't everything if you can't be on top in at least one of the areas you are in. On top of that SOFI is priced as a tech company however when I read about it it just seems like a startup bank, and this is a problem because banks don't grow as fast as tech companies and aren't priced as such, we saw what happens when a non tech company is priced like one in WeWork and SOFI seems very similar, the question is how much longer can they get away with a ""tech"" valuation."
6/30/2021 13:27,stocks,"Jack of all trades, Master of none. Everything they do I am already doing through other parties. None of their offerings are any better than the credit union, insurer, brokerage, ie the companies or services I've already sought out and selected. They have nice bells and whistles and using game theory & bonuses to lure in their customers.  
I hold a small position and created an account yesterday to get a gander and start my deeper due diligence."
6/30/2021 14:41,stocks,"I haven't done a ton of research on them, but their selling point seems to be that they are an all in one financial app. Banking, loans, insurance, trading....all together. 

Personally, I already have all those things, but they are spread over 3-4 companies/apps. All those apps work together pretty well.....I can easily add money from my bank to my brokerage account already, without fees or time lag. Maybe it's a bit easier if everything I have is SoFi, but not enough so I'm inclined to change all these things in and join SoFi. 

Also, it seems like their big appeal is being the first to do this, but it seems like square and PayPal both might have eyes on this concept. I know square just applied for a bank charter, and PayPal talked about some coming changes this fall (I believe it was in their last conference call if you want to look it up). I think both these companies could crush SoFi if they were do inclined and have much larger existing user bases. 

That said, I have SoFi on my watch list as something interesting when the hype dies down."
6/30/2021 13:20,stocks,"You kind of already answered it - their multiple. SOFI is already priced to perfection, assuming their growth continues for years to come while improving their margins. Hedge funds are betting that increased competition will limit Sofi’s market share and therefore would not justify its current valuation ~$17 billion. 

There is also a large short position related to upcoming lock-up expirations which is just a quick short term play. Will be interesting to see what the short interest looks like after that."
6/30/2021 14:40,stocks,"Getting caught up in the WSB hype kinda makes it look like an iffy company short term no matter how much it runs, and it’ll probably keep serious investors away. 

Bear case, I’m thinking after the meme hype around it dies down in the next month or so, the volume drops significantly, and their new customer base drops a good bit, stock probably falls to sub $15 and stays there until late this year or early next year.

I don’t hold a position currently but I’m bullish on them long term, 3+ years."
6/30/2021 14:24,stocks,"Their bank charter is not approved in November and their user base stops growing at it's current clip (or even 60% of it's current rate). At that point I would expect the stock price to drop RAPIDLY down to $10-12. BUT there also doesnt seem to be a lot of evidence from my POV that would suggest that they would be denied. I'm very bullish but also long in terms of when I see this stock rising, most likely 2-3 years and finish off at a nice little $35-40 price w/ some dividends in the future hopefully lol"
6/30/2021 17:57,stocks,"lol the bear cases are honestly weak. It’s not about better offering for each individual product. It’s the whole ecosystem and comprehensive tech driven infrastructure that they have established and who they target as customers  (yes the millennials who want a one stop shop for all financing needs and it all started with a student loan) to bring in massive growth without the brick and mortar capital requirements. I’m in my late 30s and I could see how my nieces and nephews would use Sofi when they get older. I myself have been banking with BoA and hate everything about the traditional banking system. I literally use a different third party platform for every other financial need like mortgage, credit cards, insurance, investing, retirement, etc. I could see how Sofi is capitalizing on the digital financing demand from the millennials who prefer efficiency over some minor differences in offering quality which btw Sofi will be constantly improving."
6/30/2021 15:55,stocks,"I have yet to see any valid bear cases.  Not offering anything new, one stop shop in a sea of others, high multiple blah blah blah.  Sofi will be incredibly sticky to millennials and younger gens.  Banks fear fintech and fintech wants bank charters.  Sounds like a meet in the middle opportunity for a buy out.  Either way, I’m long sofi.  

Your parents bank at old established banks and your kids will bank at fintechs.  It’s inevitable and the industry knows it."
6/30/2021 15:53,stocks,"Honestly, go sign up and apply for an auto loan. Just go through the process (won’t affect credit score) and you’ll fucking sell ASAP like I did.

Warning, you’ll get a thousand emails, calls and texts from Sofi and their “partners” because they’re still using the 2006 spam financing model. Its garbage. I was expected sleek and cutting edge based on the company aesthetics but it’s “jimmy’s house of finance” with pretty marketing. Fuck that."
6/30/2021 14:47,stocks,"Not a deal breaker, but lower growth on the student loan originations business because post-secondary enrollment will be shrinking over the next decade"
6/30/2021 15:55,stocks,"CAC (customer acquisition cost) sucks in finance.  Search around for ""SoFI customer acquisition"" and then align that with what types of revenue they can bring in per customer.

SoFI wrote the mother-of-all CAC checks purchasing the naming rights to the LA stadium (\~$400M)

You have to be really differentiated to make that pay off... and eh, are we there yet?  Will we get there?"
6/30/2021 17:37,stocks,I can give solid bear cases for some of my other investments but for SoFi I think the only thing not to like is the valuation and the fact that their markets will always be quite competitive (limiting their pricing power).
6/30/2021 19:47,stocks,"Don’t WFC and other banks have apps? All I use is WFC for checking, savings, and credit. Fees don’t matter since I pay everything off or go to a physical location to get cash. If I wanted to I could do brokerage at wfc, but I use fidelity and TDA. Other than hunting for a good mortgage there is zero incentive for me to switch/use another bank. Not rich enough to need 2 banks for fdic coverage.

Chamath is a huge red flag as an investor. Dude is a huckster. 

Seems similar to Ally bank or other online banks rather than tech. If they don’t fall on their faces or are another chamath scam I would look at other online only bank stocks for valuation."
6/30/2021 15:26,stocks,"You make a good point. The main ""tech"" point seems to be Galileo and the fact that they run on your smartphone and not in a brick & mortar location. But those aren't really ""tech"" things and are very close to being just another bank"
6/30/2021 19:14,stocks,"""Everything they do, I am already doing through other parties.""

Yeah but wouldn't it be easier to do all those things through one party? I mean this is what they're going for right? One stop financial shop with a physical and digital presence and a pretty UI.

Shares and leaps since IPOE but a personal user of thier robo advisor as well."
6/30/2021 15:50,stocks,Square did not just apply for a bank charter. They just *received* their bank charter. Square Financial Services is a fully licensed bank: https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-financial-services-begins-banking-operations
6/30/2021 16:59,stocks,"All of that is probably dry, factual truth.  But what's left out is the social palatabliity of SoFi with their customers.  They have an identity of being the socially responsible choice.  I own the stock but even I can't say whether the social responsibility runs deep, or is shallow, or somewhere in between.  I just know that they have *some* claim to that identity whereas many banks have none."
6/30/2021 18:23,stocks,"This man stocks. 

I agree - the valuation right now is the battle, not the business."
6/30/2021 16:46,stocks,">Your parents bank at old established banks and your kids will bank at fintechs. 

It’s just a branding thing. The kids choose Venmo over PayPal because it hasn’t entirely clicked that that they are the same company and nearly the same product. It also hasn’t clicked that “fintech” mostly just means “slightly less regulated and therefore less safe bank”. The idea is that once that does click brand loyalty will be established and switching costs will be high and people will stay where they are.

It’s why SoFi is going so heavy on advertising. Gotta build that brand loyalty."
6/30/2021 19:58,stocks,why is the case that sofi's valuation is too high invalid
6/30/2021 18:31,stocks,"I agree, it's like calling the legacy banks tech companies because they all use tech and will definitely use it in the future but that doesn't make them ""Tech companies"" same with SOFI just because it runs on technology and doesn't have physical locations doesn't make it any diffrent than a bank and won't make it grow faster or change the whole banking business model which is why I won't be investing in SOFI, I think its a fine company nothing I'm avoiding like the plague, but I think the market is way overhyped on this."
6/30/2021 19:31,stocks,">Yeah but wouldn't it be easier to do all those things through one party?

Maybe, but it's not compelling enough. I have my checking at BOA, my mortgage at Wells Fargo, my brokerage at fidelity, my credit card at Citi. I have no desire to switch/simplify. 

I think the key for SOFI is getting people to start there with the checking account then lure them in to everything else. That first bank you start with is sticky. 

I have sofi shares as well."
6/30/2021 19:38,stocks,"The IPOE is intriguing and I haven't checked out the robo advisor. I honestly do not see how having all those services wrapped under one umbrella would be advantageous other than convenience. Otherwise knowing that I've got the best insurance is something I shop around for, same for loans and my brokerage. We'll see if they can beat the value and compete for all those services, I'm open to it."
6/30/2021 16:43,stocks,"Thanks! I'm not an owner of square, so I'm not always up to date."
6/30/2021 17:04,stocks,the value that venmo adds is the UI. no one wants to look at the ugly paypal app
6/30/2021 18:16,stocks,"Not really an accurate characterization of fintechs.  Safety can be more or less, it's situational.   

Fintechs haven't been ""the same product"".  Fintechs have typically identified what customer want, and how to make those functions seamless.  Banks haven't.  This was starkly admitted by JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon just two weeks ago when he candidly admitted that they couldn't do what Square and the others did because they lack the creative impetus."
6/30/2021 17:31,stocks,"This is the first paragraph of the Venmo user agreement. You have to sign a contract with PayPal and have a US bank account to use the service. That’s really taking it to PayPal and banks.

>This user agreement is a contract between you and PayPal, Inc. governing your use of your Venmo account and the Venmo services. You must be in the United States and have a U.S. bank account to use the Venmo services.

The UI when you sign up is just mimicking what your iPhone does when you update the operating system or get a new phone. Sync up your contacts and agree to various options so PayPal can get more data from you. And then once you’re set up it kind of looks like a barebones 2008 Facebook. Same color scheme."
6/30/2021 19:28,stocks,"Dimon concluded by saying “I expect to win”.

One thing all the fintech bulls ignore is that the banks’ jointly owned fintech, Zelle, has greater [market share](https://www.emarketer.com/content/breaking-down-mobile-p2p-payments-biggest-players) than Square and is [growing faster](https://www.businessinsider.com/zelle-q1-transaction-volume-lifted-by-small-businesses-2021-5) by some metrics."
6/30/2021 17:39,stocks,The UI is great.  I personally love Venmo and use it all the time.  I paid a real estate agent a fee using Venmo lol
6/30/2021 17:52,stocks,I’m apartment hunting myself and just paid an application fee. But although that was less than a week ago I honestly couldn’t tell you if I used PayPal or my debit MasterCard to pay it. It does amount to exactly the same thing.
6/30/2021 18:02,stocks,"Venmo is far more versatile though.  I get the mechanics are the same, sure.  But family and friends don’t take debit cards, they take Venmo.  And because of that, there is a fundamental difference."
6/30/2021 19:26,stocks,Venmo ripped off WeChat and the benefit is to easily be able to pay family and friends. Go out to dinner and don't have cash. Venmo the person paying.
6/30/2021 13:15,stocks,"""And that could help ease some strain in its relationships with musicians, who have consistently complained that streaming their songs is a poor source of revenue.""

Also doesn't help that Spotify is bleeding money and isn't profitable on a yearly basis, yet."
6/30/2021 15:00,stocks,"Virtual concerts are beyond shit, just a glorified music video. Needs vr to even try to begin competing with actual live concerts. Won't happen for years and years."
6/30/2021 13:41,stocks,"I spent decades working in live events and some of it was with streaming.  Everyone is trying to stick their fingers in this pie: the promoters (Live Nation), the venues (Madison Sq Garden, etc), the labels and the artists directly if large enough (Rolling Stones are known for this going back to the early 2000s.

The last people artists will sign a deal with are the people who pay them the least."
6/30/2021 13:32,stocks,"As much as we would all love ticket master and live nation to have some competition they are going to find it exceptionally hard to enter that space in the US. You would literally need to build or buy dozens of venues. Path of least resistance is festivals, not venues."
6/30/2021 13:56,stocks,"Musicians can complain all they want. Streaming music is here and it isn't going away. People buy very few songs nowdays. And I can't see it reverting back to prestreaming.

On everyone else on here, love how all the haters flock in.

But as Spotify keeps growing they will become a behemoth in the next decade. Long term hold/add for sure.

My only concern is apple/AMZN competition. But I think Spotify does it best, and there's room for more than one streaming service."
6/30/2021 13:54,stocks,Trying to compete against Live Nation eh?
6/30/2021 17:46,stocks,Lol they might be in for a shock when they find out they actually have to pay the artists for those.
6/30/2021 13:46,stocks,Everyone i know uses Spotify but they still can’t make money lol
6/30/2021 15:18,stocks,"Its costs per play is also some of the lowest around and they're trying to force it even lower for smaller artists by giving them tools and exposure that used to be free.

The fact that, dispite paying the least per play and the largest user base they cant make money doesnt bode well.

If its user figures slide expect even greater pushback by artists for higher fees as spotify loses its ""must be on"" platform power"
6/30/2021 13:23,stocks,Definitely a long-term hold. They’ve invested a lot into their podcast business recently so hopefully see some returns from that in the next couple of years. If they can figure out targeted ads on podcasts that’ll change the game.
6/30/2021 18:49,stocks,That’s your opinion. I for one enjoyed seeing my favourite artist live. I payed to see them play through a ten year anniversary album.
6/30/2021 17:16,stocks,Guess whose best friends? Daniel Ek & the Zuck. May happen sooner
6/30/2021 13:46,stocks,"They also need to do LIVE events. After 1.5 years of covid and virtual events, no ones going to want to pay for virtual events ever again"
6/30/2021 14:21,stocks,Ticket master doesnt own the venues though
6/30/2021 18:08,stocks,"Tbf musicians made very little off money their records before streaming. It's just that streaming is reducing it further. They always made most of their money doing live shows and merch. Like one commentator said, live events are oversaturated, Venues, promoters, labels are all trying to be the middle man. Spotify needs to put band merch into their app. Sell shirts and CD and little trinkets as Spotify exclusives. But honestly they suffer from the Uber effect where it's almost impossible to gain profitability. They can cut out all revenue to artist and they will go SoundCloud, and even if they do cut revenue to artist and artists stay on Spotify, they still won't make a profit. Their business model is flawed if they don't expand out of streaming they will continually make losses"
6/30/2021 14:19,stocks,Yea but what’s the plan to make the business model profitable? Music streaming doesnt make much
6/30/2021 14:10,stocks,"What’s the Scott Adams quote?

“Buy stock in companies you hate”

?"
6/30/2021 14:42,stocks,"The second Spotify starts to make money, the record companies up their cut/costs to Spotify for licensing lmao. Spotify can't win."
6/30/2021 18:55,stocks,It's a brutal industry. I believe most music streaming platforms don't make money. Apple is able to use theirs as a loss leader but for Spotify it's their entire company. They pretty much have to branch out like this into new things.
6/30/2021 14:14,stocks,This means literally nothing lol
6/30/2021 18:29,stocks,"They already have partnerships to buy merch via the app.

Anyway, I think your mistake is looking at Spotify as only a music streaming company. They're obviously much more than that, they're a media company. It's like saying amazon is only an online store."
6/30/2021 19:00,stocks,"Right and as soon they start making profit, record labels will start increasing their margin"
6/30/2021 14:18,stocks,Yea just like how everyone uses uber even though it doesnt make a profit. It just scales out the losses.
6/30/2021 18:38,stocks,">They already have partnerships to buy merch via the app.

I know they do, my point is to expand it. When Kanye dropped Jesus is King all there was were the vinyl and a shitty shirt. They need more and exclusive stuff or time limited stuff. 

>Anyway, I think your mistake is looking at Spotify as only a music streaming company. They're obviously much more than that, they're a media company. It's like saying amazon is only an online store.

Right now what makes them a media company? And which portion of this media company is not making a loss"
6/30/2021 15:49,stocks,Somebody is making bucks
6/30/2021 17:17,stocks,First thing I thought of
6/30/2021 18:42,stocks,"Selling merch isn't going to bring them to the promise land. Just like, for Amazon, their main profitability is not from selling trinkets.

Not saying in anyway Spotify will become amazon of x btw, it's just an easy comparison.

To answer your other question, for starters, podcasts. They've invested huge amounts of money into them. Audiobooks as well. And that's just the start.

Anyway, clearly you are bearish on them and that's fine. To each their own, but I'm pretty comfortable with them over the next 5+ years."
6/30/2021 18:47,stocks,"They aren't going to make a ton of money off merch, but it will have a higher profit margin than whatever they have rn. Audiobooks and Podcasts are in the same vein as music streaming the margins are slim to none even if they don't share revenue. If they increase the price of their subscription, people will just go to SoundCloud or piracy. There is no path to profitability with Spotify if they don't look outside of what they are doing. Their biggest bane of their existence is SoundCloud and piracy. 

But agree to disagree, I don't think that they will collapse or anything but I see them as a perpetual loss making company until they either change their business model or they get acquired by a bigger media conglomerate like Warner Brothers or Netflix or more likely Disney. And either get absorbed or delisted This is my opinion"
6/30/2021 18:50,stocks,"I mean, if it's such a shit business Amazon and aapl wouldn't be entering this space as well. Among others.

Seeing how difficult it is for companies to break into the China market, this is a good bet. The negatives, of course, would be (1) a potential competitor big enough to consume significant market share, and/or (2) government intervention/regulation."

6/30/2021 0:00,stocks,"Looking to a pullback & beyond   

Been reading recently of how many Redditers are advocating for another pullback/recession given the amount of money sloshing around the economy or the various deadly Covid variations making the rounds of other countries or some combination of both. Some Redditers, even though rather aggressive have a lot of good points.  Not saying they are wrong, but it would seem time to take prudent steps to get your portfolio in order and shake loose some money.

Unfortunately all of them seem to be firmly glued to extremes - either sell everything now and sit on cash or keep money in the market until the very last second and then pull it all out of the market in the nick of time (never worked for me). I am working a different angle that is a longer game.

What both approaches above share is buy once then forget until panicked selling. Admittedly it uses less time lurching into buying and then lunging into selling than my method. 

I buy dividend stocks so that I can watch my money grow with or without a recession. Not saying never participated in the occasional rocket:  jail stock, health stock or  gaming stock. Just went in for a quick profit on the meme's and was out. Quick & clean. But the dividend stocks are treated differently.

After doing DD, I closely monitor these stocks for their price movement after I buy them. When I initially buy it is a small amount - \~ 40% of what I ultimately want to own. I keep this as a core position then trade in the stock - buying when it has a pull back and selling when the trading position goes higher. My ultimate goal is to own these dividend stocks at a average cost of less than $3-$5/share in less than 3 years.

Using this method, I own a good handful of stocks at less than $3/share which makes just about any crash meaningless to these stocks in my portfolio. So far have used this method on ¼ of the  stocks in portfolio. Stocks have done this to include: 

AES - avg. cost $3.57 \[did have a cost basis of zero, then a buying opp occurred\] - Currently selling for $26.25

CVA - avg. cost $.46 \[ yeah that is correct 46 cents\] Currently selling for $17.47.

CC - avg cost $8.75 \[still working on this one\] Currently selling for $34.64.

CWEN - avg cost $10.46 \[still working on this one\] Currently selling for $26.67.

HEES - avg. cost $13.20 \[still working on this one\] Currently selling for $33.24.

HASI - avg. cost $.74 Currently selling for $56.73.

HTGC - avg. cost $6.33 \[still working on this one\] Currently selling for $17.01

IIPR - avg cost $24.62 \[afraid that is about as good as this will get\] Currently selling for $193.55.

RF - avg cost $1.21 Currently selling for $20.08.

SPTN - avg. cost $.124 Currently selling for $18.79

SKT - $7.57 \[ still working on this one. Bought stock 4 months before became a momentary meme stock. Thanks Redditers for making this a meme stock one time\] Currently selling for $18.79.

The bulk of my portfolio are made up of stocks like MAIN, FE, ET, ETRN, IRM, etc that were bought at decent to good prices and am looking for a correction/recession to add to them. With the stocks I have gotten down in price recently - CVA, CC, RF, SPTN I have a pretty good head start on cash that has been freed up to indulge the other dividend stocks I own and get their cost down.

There is just something, to me, about having a stock that has a YOC of 190% (HASI) \[$.74 (stock price)/by $1.40 (yearly dividend)\] that makes me smile at night when I go to sleep."

My man, you still lost money if the stock goes to $26.24. If you’re holding onto a stock because you think it’s impossible to go below your cost basis, you’re in for some trouble. You should be buying and selling based on the future not the past."

No, you missed the point; sorry I was not more clear.  As an investor one does not have to be either all in or all out, like many of the doom & gloomers about the upcoming economic calamity proclaim from their soapboxes.  There are nuances. 

One only can lose money when you sell a stock.  If you hold it is a paper loss.  My argument is that I am in stocks for the long haul, preservation of principle is important (keeping profit is good but not as important as principle), and ones money has to be in the market to work long term benefits.  To do that, in my mind, need to aggressively get the price of shares down thereby freeing up cash for other stock buys.  In this case as a fund for buying depressed shares in a correction/recession.  Second to hang on to those original stocks through corrections/recessions to get more cheap shares through DRIP's."

6/30/2021 0:00,stocks,"Tesla’s Delivery Report Is Coming. Please share your thoughts? Tesla ‘s quarterly delivery report, always a key point to watch for investors, could offer more than usual this quarter. It will tell stories about the automotive semiconductor shortage, Tesla’s recent woes in China, and overall demand for electric vehicles.

The consensus call on Wall Street is that the EV pioneer delivered about 201,000 vehicles in the second quarter, but expectations might be creeping upward. “We believe 200,000 is the line in the sand and right now it’s biased upside given stronger Europe and China demand,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Barron’s.

Ives rates Tesla shares at Buy. His target for the stock is $1,000, while the price closed at $680.67 on Tuesday afternoon.

6/30/2021 13:21,stocks,I wish you all make a ton of money but be smart guys. There are better plays out there than hoping for another ath for Tesla. As much as I love her I believe they are over the top atm. You asked for opinion I hope you are not biased and only want to hear ''AYE'' sayers!
6/30/2021 19:57,stocks,"Me, excited to see growth on my ONE share"
6/30/2021 14:24,stocks,"I came to see the comments of all the reddit armchair CEO's 

I am not dissapointed."
6/30/2021 15:18,stocks,"Honestly I don't care too much what the numbers are as a Tesla investor. If the numbers aren't as good as they should be it'll be parts shortages that's the issue no doubt.

That said keep in mind, historically auto sales tend to be weaker in the first two quarters of the year. People are a lot more likely to buy a new car in the second half of the year then the first half.

Also, it's going to be ridiculously easy for Tesla to beat their Q2 2020 numbers given that their factory was shut down that quarter."
6/30/2021 11:12,stocks,The stock is close to its 24th June highs of $697...I'm guessing positive news would push the stock close to $800
6/30/2021 14:37,stocks,Delivered today recalled tomorrow. Scared is how I’d be feeling
6/30/2021 12:19,stocks,"I think the main issue is even if they keep all up as they say they will and that means half of the population will drive Tesla in 10 years it's still overvalued. So I wouldn't even be bothered about this or the following 12 reports, unless the stock price gets closer to reality."
6/30/2021 12:37,stocks,Dan Ives is a total clown.
6/30/2021 10:54,stocks,TSLA isn’t a car company - it’s a tech company that sells cars. So I don’t think the delivery report really means anything.
6/30/2021 11:10,stocks,When is it expected to come?
6/30/2021 12:18,stocks,"Yea, the high of the stock was definitely at 697, not around 900..."
6/30/2021 13:10,stocks,"You're not taking into account that Tesla will expand into far more different revenue streams once they get things into shape. I think Tesla being the most valuable company in the next decade is a real possibility. Look at where every country is trying to get to... EV's. It's a revolutionary product that is still in its very early stages. This isn't your traditional auto company. If you're comparing Tesla to GM, Ford, etc., just because they both sell vehicles, you're already in the wrong discussion."
6/30/2021 13:02,stocks,Which reality? Your I guess
6/30/2021 10:59,stocks,"Lol, what? Deliveries matter because it shows demand. Tesla is a tech AND car company."
6/30/2021 12:56,stocks,"I hate this argument. What ""tech"" is anyone buying from TSLA? The same as Toyota, Honda, GM, Ford, and every other car company. The ability to get from point A to B. It is a car company. Take away the car and what do you get?"
6/30/2021 12:38,stocks,"A tech company that sells you tech for $50,000 and gives you the car as a freebie?"
6/30/2021 12:08,stocks,"Let test this awesome logic.  Tomorrow Elon announces that Tesla will ceases to sell cars and shutting down all of its operations because it’s a tech company. 

What’s going to happen?  Such dumb logic."
6/30/2021 12:51,stocks,Not sure. The last quarter's report  was on 4th April and the earlier one on 2nd January
6/30/2021 16:15,stocks,I heard probably on the 1st or 2nd so still this week
6/30/2021 11:29,stocks,"Actually it shows supply.

Deliveries is a metric for Tesla’s execution as a manufacturer, not one that shows whether customers want the product or not. They sell them all."
6/30/2021 11:05,stocks,It shows the demand for their cars now. But I think they will have more revenue in 10 years from licensing their software and design features than they will from selling their own cars.
6/30/2021 13:40,stocks,They’re not now but they will. The software that is in Tesla’s vehicles is nothing like what anyone else has.
6/30/2021 12:11,stocks,"Yeah, growing EV deliveries doesn't show demand. Genius statement. Where do some of ya'll learn to invest from?"
6/30/2021 11:08,stocks,That doesn't change the fact that Tesla's delivery numbers at this stage of their business is very important and will continue to be. That's like saying Apple's iPhones aren't going to be as important as their services segment in the future. They go hand-in-hand.
6/30/2021 15:41,stocks,“They’re not now but they will be.” Ok so your saying Tesla is not a tech company currently?
6/30/2021 12:22,stocks,"No, growing EV deliveries from tesla shows how many they could make and deliver because they have always sold them all. It’s a metric of their execution not the market. 

I just paid cash for my third tesla, and all three are from investing. 

I named this one after you for the day.

How are you doing?

Come at me sideways with snarky comments? Yes I’m petty af."
6/30/2021 15:43,stocks,Its good to be objective about stocks. However its bad to be emotional about them. You seem like the ladder and probably shouldnt be investing if you get this emotional about a stock.
6/30/2021 12:45,stocks,"How many they can make is already disclosed. Deliveries show units sold. They aren't mutually exclusive just because Tesla sells the majority of the vehicles they produce. You don't make any sense.

Are you seriously bragging about a Tesla vehicle as if it's impressive? I bought a $635,000 condo in NYC four years ago that is worth about $850,000 in the open market. You think you're some hotshot because you bought a Tesla? Lol, way to get triggered."
6/30/2021 12:47,stocks,"Oh homie, those purchases were tipping the dealer, not the extent.

You should spend time in large scale supply chain management and manufacturing."
6/30/2021 12:46,stocks,Damn you sure do cry a lot.  Projecting much?
6/30/2021 12:51,stocks,"When you aren't emotionally invested into a discussion to the point where you think bragging about your Tesla vehicle improves your argument, come talk to me. You're literally talking about baby money here with your vehicle but you felt so compelled to brag about it."
6/30/2021 14:27,stocks,You are both cringe losers. Bragging about gains on an online anonymous internet forum.
6/30/2021 12:52,stocks,"No, you came at me sideways with snarky comments and I returned the favor in kind.

I was polite af until you crossed the line.

Go read homie."
6/30/2021 12:56,stocks,"""It's actually supply.""

No, it's demand. Just because Tesla sells about as many vehicles as they produce doesn't mean you change the definition. You tried to think you're more 'intelligent' than you really are. 

Next, you brag about your Tesla vehicle. The gains alone from my condo the past four years could buy every single Tesla vehicle you own.   


You're focused on the wrong things, 'homie.'"
6/30/2021 12:59,stocks,"You’ve gone from being the instigator introducing snarky comments at me, to asking for a civil conversation, to going right back to trying to make snarky comments.

It’s lame."
6/30/2021 0:00,stocks,"Too late to get on Intellia? Count me as one of the dumbos who only got aware of this stock and its potential after it jumped.

So what do you guys think -- time to ride it now because it'll only get bigger from here? From what I read they're only going to start now on FDA registration (source: [https://www.biospace.com/article/intellia-regeneron-announce-first-ever-clinical-data-in-vivo-genome-editing-/](https://www.biospace.com/article/intellia-regeneron-announce-first-ever-clinical-data-in-vivo-genome-editing-/) \- end of the article)

Or is it too late"
6/30/2021 12:47,stocks,I pulled out with 250% gains. Biotech companies ALWAYS DROP!!!
6/30/2021 11:05,stocks,This is a long hold for me. I'm also in CRSP & EDIT because not sure who will win
6/30/2021 14:15,stocks,"I'm in BEAM, EDIT, and NTLA for at least 10 years.  Such new technology needs to mature a bit more."
6/30/2021 16:46,stocks,"Check also GRPH: it did the IPO this week (perfect timing) and is riding nicely like all the sector.
I'm invested in this field since last December, but we are just at the beginning. There's a lot of speculation, big funds rotating in, but this is the future.
Of course you have to be in for the long run (5 plus years), because the commercial path is long.
Buy and forget about it. Could find your 10 bagger later on."
6/30/2021 0:00,stocks,"IPO - Robinhood (YOU) Clear Any thoughts on this hyped ipo on Robinhood? 

I believe we need to stay away from this ipo as they show lack of potential to generate revenue and profit and moght be doing this just to raise more money so they can waste it (not literally, lol)"
6/30/2021 19:15,stocks,May end up being my first short position ever.
6/30/2021 10:42,stocks,Can't wait to short this.  POS company.
6/30/2021 10:48,stocks,I wish the CEOs godspeed in unloading positions before the bottom drops out.
6/30/2021 10:45,stocks,FINRA just slapped them with a $70m fine for “significant harm to customers.”
6/30/2021 10:23,stocks,I believe it will spike at open then TANK! but what the hell do I know just a guess. No advice here.
6/30/2021 10:29,stocks,Yea post some facts instead of opinions. Scared money doesn’t make money.
6/30/2021 11:10,stocks,Buying puts isn’t shorting.
6/30/2021 11:03,stocks,How’s that working out? Hahahah
6/30/2021 10:25,stocks,"No offense am on Robinhood too, but I think Robinhood idots will definitely spike it and gonna tank it later when they realize it’s full of shit"
6/30/2021 11:05,stocks,"Ipo’s if you know are very speculative, so if you like it or not they’re mostly opinion based.
But to give you facts, the company has been showing net loss for past 10 years, decreasing assets, decline in free cash flow, increases in competition. They even state it in their s-1 filings that they’re afraid they might not be able to sustain for longer period if they don’t see a good amount of growth in paying customers, which right not they’re having hard time converting from non-paying customers"
6/30/2021 0:00,stocks,"AMD vs NVDA, which one are you guys favoring right now? I’ve noticed that recently these two stocks becoming more popular discussion points, with NVDA having a 4 to 1 split in mid July and AMD’s projected growth. I’m curious to know which of the two you guying are liking better and what your points are for your favored stock?"
6/30/2021 10:15,stocks,The correct answer is both with a bit of TSM on the side.
6/30/2021 11:46,stocks,I’m very bullish for NVDA; might trim my exposure after the split tho
6/30/2021 10:36,stocks,"Both. I'm serious. AMD will have a few great months, then NVDA will, then AMD will. They really aren't volatile, they just hang out and wait for their turn."
6/30/2021 14:53,stocks,"I couldn’t decide 5 years ago so I bought both and boy did it work out for me lol.

That being said AMD valuation short term looks better but long term NVDA will be an absolute beast. So will AMD but I think NVDA will be a top 5 market cap company one day."
6/30/2021 15:49,stocks,I like how intel is out of the question
6/30/2021 9:30,stocks,Both are great but I think NVDA has rising significantly recently where as AMD is starting its rise with a plethora of good news
6/30/2021 9:54,stocks,Just buy both
6/30/2021 11:45,stocks,50/50. I truly don't believe anyone can reliably predict which one will outperform the other. That knowledge depends on far too many unknown variables at this time.
6/30/2021 14:16,stocks,"NVDAs going to 1 trillion on the back of their data center GPUs. 

AMDs going to continue growing as their GPU market increases. 

So the answer is both."
6/30/2021 10:15,stocks,"NVDA and AMD are always chomping at the bit trying to get ahead of the other. As such, there’s always a great ebb and flow between the two. When one pushes ahead, the other lacks behind. If you go long on both, look at who’s currently doing better. Roll more into the other. AMD was crushing it last year then intel dropped the 10th and subsequently, 11th gen processors and pulled ahead again. My portfolio more heavily favored Intel and I came out ahead. Now its the opposite. Their back and forth has done me well for the last 6-7 years."
6/30/2021 16:19,stocks,"nvidia had its run. doesn't mean its not gonna keep going but thats gonna be the harder trade imo

but when amd closes the xilinx deal...watch out"
6/30/2021 18:03,stocks,Just added 700 more AMD shares
6/30/2021 16:16,stocks,I'm bullish on the entire semiconductor industry for at least the next 5 years. I see no reason to choose one over the other.
6/30/2021 17:21,stocks,I like AMD because a lot of intel’s market share is up for grabs. Both seem like good buys tho.
6/30/2021 17:22,stocks,"I just went in harder on AMD. 

I’ve always loved the stock. I remember when I heard about them making waves back when you could buy the stock at $5-6. I regret not going heavy in them almost as much as me missing Tesla.

They have a good product, a nice clientele list, and good leadership. They will be the all the better in the days to come."
6/30/2021 14:36,stocks,"I have all four, NVDA, AMD, TSM and Intel. Number of shares in that order. Own both NVDA and AMD for over 5 years so well vested and plan to hold them for long. 

TSM and Intel are strategic, both are building new plants in AZ which will add to supply chain. With mgmt change at Intc it is possible that it goes heavy in fab business and grow while it may loose market share to amd and nVDA it may increase revenue from fab business. Of course since no one knows what future holds, I am hedging my bets on all four."
6/30/2021 16:20,stocks,I think both are fantastic but AMD has more room to run. Especially given where it is in relation to its ATH.
6/30/2021 16:28,stocks,AMD is more fairly valued than NVDA
6/30/2021 10:30,stocks,"NVDA. They have so many good things going for them but they are going big in the server space finally.

And the [pending acquisition ](https://jesbaek.com/2021/01/06/the-arm-powered-revolution-and-why-you-should-invest-in-it/) of ARM could change the game entirely."
6/30/2021 11:09,stocks,buy NVDA for the AI
6/30/2021 16:05,stocks,"Got NVDA at $215 in November 2017. When it hit $400, I thought it was overpriced. I still this stock is way overpriced but glad I am still in."
6/30/2021 12:34,stocks,AMD is in the middle of its typical rally pre-earnings so that's probably my fave!
6/30/2021 11:25,stocks,"I believe NVDA is the overall better company, AMD may have the more attractive entry point though."
6/30/2021 9:30,stocks,AMD as it has more room to grow.
6/30/2021 9:50,stocks,Both or Soxx
6/30/2021 12:43,stocks,Own both. Nvda has been on a crazy run.
6/30/2021 13:57,stocks,Buy a little of both alongside TSMC.  Semiconductors aren't going anywhere soon.
6/30/2021 14:54,stocks,INTC cries in the corner
6/30/2021 15:08,stocks,"There’s room for both and both are good invests.  Short term NVDA will out pace AMD but mid term AMD has serious room to run.

Both are fantastic long plays"
6/30/2021 10:40,stocks,I would buy both together with TSMC. But I think AMD is more valuable still they have a lot of room to grow and I hope for crypto to turn away from this hardcore mining and this will fuck more with Nvidia than AMD. I don't think that will stop Nvidia from going other ways for growth though.
6/30/2021 11:18,stocks,just read the replies on the other 10 threads that have recently asked the same question
6/30/2021 11:35,stocks,Why not both?
6/30/2021 12:23,stocks,"I'm liking AMD's growth, even with Nvidia's coming split, was more affordable.  Nvidia does have a dividend, but not enough to make me want to leap.  Watching $KLIC"
6/30/2021 13:24,stocks,"Both are good but AMD was much quicker to increase their retail price for GPUs that are in high demand.  I believe that will realize a nice jump in profits.

I prefer Nvidia cards but looking at it from an investors POV, I'm not sure why their RTX 3080 still has an MSRP at $700 yet AMD's are priced much closer to market value."
6/30/2021 14:07,stocks,NVDA seem to be an AI play on self driving and data center. AMD is expected to take Intel marketshare. I think it all depends on which narrative you prefer. I am not invested in any of the chip stocks for now. But if I have to I will invest in TSM who seem to be catalyst for all big chip producers.
6/30/2021 14:15,stocks,"I bought both back at the beginning of March (same day) and from the price I purchased:

Nvidia is up \~63%  
AMD is up \~25%

I regret nothing, both are great companies. If I had to only choose one, for the long term, it would be Nvidia.

FYI: I will never buy Intel stock. They screw the pooch way too often."
6/30/2021 14:17,stocks,"Long-ish term, AMD. They’re about to supplant Intel in the server/enterprise hardware market. 

Short-ish, NVDA. Their acquisition of Mellanox is a big deal for GPU+Nic compute nodes, and if they manage to win the court challenges to their attempted acquisition of ARM they’ll be a juggernaut. However, I find it highly unlikely that they’ll win considering the enormous opposition."
6/30/2021 14:19,stocks,YES!
6/30/2021 14:51,stocks,"I own AMD but always been interested in Nvidia. Kind of wished I had bought them over Disney.

I just been wondering what price to try to wait for since it's flown so much lately."
6/30/2021 15:36,stocks,Nvda
6/30/2021 15:38,stocks,Hedge and buy both. That’s what I did a few years ago and I’ve enjoyed the gains since.
6/30/2021 16:57,stocks,"NVDA and AMD are two of my largest holdings comprising over 25% of my portfolio. Slightly more NVDA than AMD right now just because it's been doing stupid things pre-split. AMD's last couple days might mean it'll catch up soon though.

I finally dumped INTC yesterday after way too long."
6/30/2021 17:07,stocks,"My semi basket is tsm, nvda, amd, asml, lrcx, klac, and mu"
6/30/2021 17:52,stocks,"I would say AMD due to the current market cap and quality of products being released.

Nvidia if the stock drops 20-30% would make it worth it. Current valuation is too high, I think next earnings report will bring the stock down to a more fair value."
6/30/2021 18:31,stocks,"NVDA 500bn market cap, almost 20bn annual revenue.

AMD 120bn market cap, 10bn annual revenue.

NVDA eps is 5x better, but I like AMD growth prospect.

From a technical standpoint, $100 break should really send AMD. NVDA otoh should pull back after the split July 19."
6/30/2021 19:10,stocks,AMD - They are clearly making big moves for the future right now to be a huge competitor. Lots going on. I believe in their current leadership. I think Nvidia is too complacent.
6/30/2021 11:26,stocks,AMD and it is not even close
6/30/2021 10:47,stocks,"I am on AMD camp.
Also watching TSM. Not sure if I want so much capital tied in semiconductors."
6/30/2021 14:21,stocks,"NVDA is the better company.  But at the current price, the stock price is too expensive."
6/30/2021 16:00,stocks,NVDA. Intel is due for a clapback
6/30/2021 9:54,stocks,AMD- always support the underdog
6/30/2021 10:53,stocks,AMD!!!
6/30/2021 12:32,stocks,AMD for me
6/30/2021 13:57,stocks,Honestly both are great. NVDA is king though. Especially if they buy ARM. I still think everyone’s sleeping on TSM
6/30/2021 11:36,stocks,Buy both and Tsm. I also love Ter in this sector.
6/30/2021 12:11,stocks,SMH
6/30/2021 14:28,stocks,I bought both.  They each will continue to do very well in the future.
6/30/2021 14:29,stocks,Always dips after splits so imma wait to scoop nvda two/3 weeks after.
6/30/2021 14:55,stocks,Why not both?
6/30/2021 15:15,stocks,"Either/both I’d say, AMD are trying to capture existing market share for growth, nvidia are diversifying into new areas for growth, while still competing/leading their current mainstays.

If you rope Intel into this, that would be the one I would dump of the 3, I don’t think there’s much direction there for long term explosive growth despite great profits milking tried and true methods."
6/30/2021 15:31,stocks,TSM as been in price consolidation for a couple month now. Do y'all fell like its a buy right now ?
6/30/2021 16:10,stocks,"NVDA I believe has a higher ceiling, IMO"
6/30/2021 17:01,stocks,"Correct answer would be ASML since none of these companies would exist without it, it makes the equipment for all these companies that make chips"
6/30/2021 17:04,stocks,"AMD as they already blew intel out of the water and now have their sights on gpu's.  

Nvidia has been king shit for ages so competition will do them good. I think the 6000 series really caught up to Nvidia on the gaming side (not so much on the high end for editing and rendering). One more generation and they could fully catch up/get ahead in some areas.  

I like both but I think Nvidia needs something innovative to get me to want to invest more than I have. Still a great option though."
6/30/2021 17:29,stocks,Get Intel and burn your money
6/30/2021 17:30,stocks,"AMD and Xilinx merger will make AMD better at data center equipment, taking more market share from intel. (CPU-s used in data centers are expensive)"
6/30/2021 18:02,stocks,Both lol
6/30/2021 18:23,stocks,Nobody talking about Intel and it's dividend which is why billionaires have it in their portfolio
6/30/2021 10:38,stocks,MU
6/30/2021 15:34,stocks,"The problem is that ~~AMD underdog fanboys~~ people see them as very similar companies and, as such, AMD is the clear choice because it’s cheaper and will get to Nvidia’s level at some point in the future.

This is very wrong. Nvidia is so far ahead of the game in so many key growth sectors: AI, cloud, edge, 5G, autonomous driving (both the SoC and the ML training hardware and the software stack), robotics, metaverse, and of course gaming. And never mind their focus on ARM to usurp the x86 duopoly (and not just them; every large tech company is making custom ARM CPUs). And most of these are powered by their incredibly strong moat with CUDA and their entire platform with multiple SDKs. They are used by so many companies in so many fields, many of which are very nascent and with plenty of room to grow (e.g., they make no money today on AV).

Where is AMD in any of these sectors? They’ve yet to make a dent on any AI field in any substantial way. There’s no AV focus. Software is garbage.

AMD is a chip company. Nvidia is a platform company."
6/30/2021 10:13,stocks,NVDA here.
6/30/2021 13:35,stocks,Nvidia is ridiculously high right now
6/30/2021 15:08,stocks,"AMD for the short term (now - 1 year).  NVDA for the long term (foreseeable future - years).  NVDA has so much patented technology and many plans that have yet to be released.  With the ARM acquisition looking more positive, those synergies will provide an upside to earnings potential - particularly in the area of data center computing.

For now, AMD continues to eat INTC’s lunch and will continue to do so for the next 2 - 4 years.  Why not invest in both (AMD & NVDA)?"
6/30/2021 15:51,stocks,Amd and Tsm all the way.
6/30/2021 16:01,stocks,"transitioned from $NVDA to $AMD today...$NVDA's run is over for now, it will settle at $800 for a month or two, but $AMD is just getting started...expect $120 as the price target"
6/30/2021 16:07,stocks,NVDA went up a lot so now it's AMD's turn.
6/30/2021 11:07,stocks,NVDA makes me happy

6/30/2021 12:29,stocks,"Both... both is good

With nvidia getting arm  ( still waiting for approval)

And amd  xilinx ( just got approved )


Both have vers bright futures imo and i own both..

Its almost a duopoly  just like with airbus and boeing which i also own.

Maybe intel can be a play here to for the future groth of gpu accelerated products and  new wafer production centers"
6/30/2021 13:24,stocks,"Both. If the entry price for NVDA is too high, buy AMD now, then NVDA after the split."
6/30/2021 14:24,stocks,Nvda is too boosted by the recent crypto boom imo
6/30/2021 15:41,stocks,Intel
6/30/2021 15:42,stocks,"Neither... but only right now.  

Right now I would rather own the SEMI CAPS which are trading at very low P/Es on the back of a historical CapEx spending cycle in Semis.  

Within the next year or so, I would then move into both AMD and NVDA as the upcoming increased capacity (particularly at the sub 10nm process node) means AMD and NVDA both will have enough supply to sell as many chips as their customers want.  

Then both AMD and NVDA can proceed to finish murdering Intel's chip design arm in the data center."
6/30/2021 16:44,stocks,AMD. NVDA GPU market share is not sustainable. RDNA2 being Zen moment for AMD Graphics.

6/30/2021 14:28,stocks,"NVDA by far, NVDA is huge, its got the name and AI behind it, it has the 'cool' factor. I bought NVDA just a few months ago for $500 now its already past $800 while AMD has been at $85 for as long as I remember."
6/30/2021 10:09,stocks,amd.
6/30/2021 11:57,stocks,"AMD for sure, I personally use their processors and they have a high degree of performance while still maintaining a relatively competitive price compared to the rest of the chip makers in the industry"
6/30/2021 13:59,stocks,"Waiting for that ""INTEL IS UNDERVALUED!!"" guy to come in anytime now...."
6/30/2021 12:02,stocks,Both but slightly favoring NVDA. Because once they get their arm cpu running it's gonna change the cpu landscape. I would bet good money it'll give apple silicon cpu a run for it's money
6/30/2021 13:00,stocks,Imo I think $AMD still has lots of growth and room to achieve!
6/30/2021 13:23,stocks,My favorite is ASML. Why compete? Be a monopoly all down stream chip makers can’t do without
6/30/2021 14:43,stocks,"Can someone explain how nvda will grow more, since the stockprice is like $ 800."
6/30/2021 14:55,stocks,"Team RED all the way.

The Zen 5 will blow away any intel based system, and more companies like EVGA are now offering products to work with AMD where prior it was Intel only. Also on the GPU side they are going to be beating NVIDIA on sales and performance. I would not be surprised if AMD hits 118 in 3 months. My last report on them 2 weeks ago had a Price target of 89, they blew through that and market sentiment will push it even further. They are undervalued by a good bit now."
6/30/2021 16:40,stocks,"Personally, even with the stock split, I favor NVDA. Even with projected growth they still in my opinion AMD will not stay as viable as it is and will lose ground in the Processor Arena to Intel as has been the trend. NVDA on the other hand has a seriously devoted following and I think they could very well increase their market share in the gaming community.  


This is not financial advice I am a moron. This is my guess."
6/30/2021 13:30,stocks,"Valuations of both are quite high so I wouldn't buy, but in my opinion, I would watch Nvidia cause its the cheaper of the two."
6/30/2021 10:42,stocks,"amd, nvidia mooned already"
6/30/2021 14:03,stocks,what about MRVL??
6/30/2021 15:10,stocks,"Look at what nvda has done from day 1, AMD will absolutely have similar growth."

6/30/2021 12:54,stocks,Both. For in your PC and for investing.
6/30/2021 13:44,stocks,Both in my opinion while they are in the same sector they are in different focuses. Already saw AMD going up today by a good percentage amount and that's held steady. Nvidia just continues to go up and is a sure thing I would say. Hard to say which will go up more than the other
6/30/2021 14:02,stocks,"They both have good prospects given the direction of the industry. I like AMD and I'm going to buy in more soon because they have a lot of room for continued growth.

I'd like NVIDIA more if they weren't so expensive (both the stock and the GPU's)"
6/30/2021 14:34,stocks,"I like both, but I have 61 stocks so obviously have a problem choosing favorites lol"
6/30/2021 14:44,stocks,Yes.
6/30/2021 14:56,stocks,"both good. why just one of them?
get both of them and sell your intel if you have.

no financial advise."
6/30/2021 15:37,stocks,Why not both?
6/30/2021 16:23,stocks,NVDA
6/30/2021 16:50,stocks,Is AMD planning on pushing into the GPU/AI space? Is NVDA planning on pushing into the ULSI space? If the answer to either of these questions was yes then there would be a point in asking which one to favor. But the answer to both of those questions is no.
6/30/2021 16:50,stocks,"Both, and I have been in both since 2015. I've trimmed my NVDA holdings over the last month with the spike since PE is a bit exuberant and they are very exposed to crypto, regardless of what they would like to project.

If you must buy only one, get XLNX due to favorable SP ratio. Will see 10% ish upside if merger goes through, which it should."
6/30/2021 16:58,stocks,What about other semis like MU?
6/30/2021 17:06,stocks,Buy NVDA before split and start selling covered calls after the split for income.
6/30/2021 17:13,stocks,both
6/30/2021 17:19,stocks,Buy both 50/50
6/30/2021 17:24,stocks,I keep waiting for Nvidia to have a bad week or even just a day to get in before the split but it's too damn high up 55 perc over 3m and 25 on the month alone feels like the dam will break after the split and will see a mass sell off so I'm waiting unless I can get in closer to 700
6/30/2021 17:25,stocks,AMD is a stock that has never played the way I wanted
6/30/2021 17:30,stocks,He asked for one or the other.......... NVDA for sure.

They are positioned really well in so many ways. I have massive respect for AMD and have very good hopes for them long term, but NVDA has solidly future proofed themselves.

\* I do not hold positions in either stock as of 2021"
6/30/2021 18:55,stocks,I own both alongside ASML and i am not gonna sold anytime soon.
6/30/2021 19:27,stocks,Both are among the best long term investments possible imo
6/30/2021 19:32,stocks,I think that speculation of growth for both of these wonderful companies are already priced in. I’m with intel. They pay a dividend and only have a 12 P/E

AMD will likely overtake at some point in the future as they move to multi core and make Nvidia the next intel. But that's not happening tomorrow and by the time it does Nvidia will have grown anyway. 

That said I wouldn't invest in Nvidia for purely personal reasons. Terrible company that treat their customers like fan boys they can do anything to and push as much proprietary BS into the market as possible. And I say that as one of their customers/victims."
6/30/2021 13:54,stocks,"AMD I’ve seen their growth trend they won’t be stopping anytime soon, also very affordable"
6/30/2021 14:26,stocks,"Nether one currently, maybe AMD if you are impatient.

6/30/2021 19:48,stocks,"They're down right now, but somewhat longer-term play, 3-5 years I really like INTC. I bought some while they're cheap. To answer the original question I bought more AMD than Intel though. I haven't touched NVDA yet. This most recent breakout has definitely put them out of reach for me. Over half a trillion dollar market cap. Another 100% gain over the next 3-5 years brings them to a 1 trillion cap company. They would have to be really killing it in all areas with no set backs to justify that. 100% return would be incredible (20-33% return per year) but again that's best case scenario in my mind. On the other hand, Intel could double in market cap, 100% return in that time span, and be around 450 billion (smaller than NVDA is today). That's more probable to me. Obviously, a more normal 7-12% gain is more likely on either.  If you asked the question 3 months ago you would probably get a different answer, but based off today's valuation, that's my 2 cents. Now, AMD, I'm loaded up there because they're gaining market share in CPUs, GPUs, and servers and the smallest market cap. Biggest room to grow and that's partially what investing is about - future growth. I have to credit my wife for catching AMD earlier. $9-13 a share in 2017 and loaded up more on this recent dip in the 70s. I realize NVDA is also expanding in other tech areas and not just chips, but until there's a more quantifiable dollar out to those endeavors and other big tech doesn't come out ahead as the leader then it's hard to bank on those other areas of R&D. All just my opinion"
6/30/2021 11:12,stocks,Nvidia PE tho......
6/30/2021 17:54,stocks,AMD is as fundamentally sound as NVDA at a cheaper multiple.

6/30/2021 16:36,stocks,"This is almost always my answer when someone asks ""should I buy X or Y stock?"""
6/30/2021 12:59,stocks,"Idk, I entirely get what you’re saying and would agree that this is somewhat true for any company; but while AMD is becoming increasingly competitive, the disparity within the game development scene is still apparent, or atleast it was when I left the industry just before the pandemic. 

Firstly, while AMD is unquestionably good, the Nvidia products still outperform AMD’s implementation on many features, including but not limited to, Ray-tracing, which is something that’s been spoken about in the games industry at length with next generation consoles.

Now the logical conclusion is ‘better performing GPUs=more capability for developers= their card of choice for development’- this thought process is entirely justifiable, however, it is also completely wrong. A lot of GPU choice in big development companies, and sometimes smaller ones, is related to ‘devrel’ (developer relations)- in bigger companies, GPU manufacturers will approach the developers and offer to pay to have their GPU as the primary one- ever seen the opening cinematic to a game and it comes up with NVidia/whichever manufacturers logo? Now of course that company didn’t develop the game, but they did provide the processor under the impression the game would then be associated with it. 

Nvidia are far more influential in this respect, even when I was working for a smaller studio with one relatively successful game, Nvidia contacted management and provided them with top of the range GPU’s for free, as long as the studio heads agreed to have their game primarily associated with Nvidia, and be featured in their ‘Game ready’ drivers on the GeForce App. 

Essentially, Nvidia is a Titan, AMD is an Olympic God. Both extremely powerful, and on paper, Nvidia takes the edge; but the Titans were killed by the Olympic Gods, so it’s not a dead cert, but I’d bet on Nvidia"
6/30/2021 13:46,stocks,"> NVDA and AMD are always chomping at the bit trying to get ahead of the other.

This is somewhat true. But they could also both go up by taking market share from Intel."
6/30/2021 16:54,stocks,AMD and NVDA only compete in the fringes. Consumer GPUs are a small market for AMD. NVDA and AMD are complementary in CPU+GPU in consumer/server/HPC market.

6/30/2021 17:06,stocks,People don’t understand the AI advantage. Nvidia is a decade ahead of AMD for machine learning applications and adoption by programming libraries like tensorflow and pytorch
6/30/2021 19:56,stocks,"People act like NVDA is the only player in the AI game though. All big tech companies are actively developing their own AI tech. I'm not discrediting NVDAs GPU advantage, their commitment to AI, and their new server announcement. I just think banking on them being the lead in AI is similar to people banking on TSLA being the leader on autonomous vehicles and other tech. The development is there, but there's no guarantees they'll be the leader in 5-10 years. 5-10 years is what longer term investors care about."
6/30/2021 13:53,stocks,Not the most clear-cut answer for this nuanced topic.  For example Nvidia is carving out its own sector while AMD is eating up the x86 space.
6/30/2021 14:13,stocks,"Into what? Just saying ""more room to grow"" doesn't mean much. For example I could point out that Nvidia has it's hand in and is considered the best in many more sectors. Maybe it has less ""room to grow"" in those, but added up the perspective changes.

x86's future is also uncertain right now with the rise of ARM in traditionally x86 dominated sectors. ARM which Nvidia is trying to buy coincidentally. There's a real possibility that AMD and Intel find themselves in a ""adapt or die"" scenario in a a decade or less."

6/30/2021 15:41,stocks,"Yup AI > x86. Parallel computing will be huge with nvidia. Still AMD is a great company and will grow in the sever space. With the server space growing exponentially in the coming years, AMD will be the number one player IMO."

6/30/2021 15:26,stocks,"Intel is so bureaucratic to their core, it’ll be a hard plan to implement, even with great ideas.

Having worked there, they have a great way of demotivating future process engineers, treating them like techs, but requiring PHDs, making them wait years before getting a shot at being creative, as long as their KPIs are good…

Equipment sourcing/installing for R+D is slow, drawn out, and uncompromising experience, taking years instead of months. They also work poorly with smaller suppliers, expecting people to meet them at their level of bureaucracy, which, again, is slow/hard for smaller suppliers to do.

So any bombastic announcements from them will be sales pitch based, as developing new products/techniques is a long long iterative process for them, which isn’t working now tick/tock is out the window, and 7/10nm failures are still ongoing (FA busy as ever, with even more high priority dies), and only salvaged samples are having a price slapped on them to recoup some costs."
6/30/2021 16:39,stocks,If it's not clear you have your answer. The allocation is a bit trickier haha
6/30/2021 13:40,stocks,"Hmm, interesting. I always assumed that the GPU company logo shown in the opening screens of some games was because they used some proprietary software from that company, like Nvidia Hairworks.

6/30/2021 14:48,stocks,"For sure. Holding positions in both at the same time is ideal. Holding Intel is also a great idea.

Which also leads me into this. I should have also included that the same applies to Intel. It’s a weird 3 way between them with AMD and NVDA squaring off on the giraffical (gif not jif lol) side. Intel and AMD hashing it out on CPU side.

Edit: I’ve held a small position in Intel since 2009. AMD and NVDA since 2014. Been swing trading larger positions in all 3 since 2018."
6/30/2021 17:04,stocks,"NVIDIA also absolutely dominates the artificial intelligence/machine learning market. Google has TPUs for rent in the cloud, but by far Nvidia GPUs are the way everyone goes. AMD GPUs can’t even work with machine learning without some serious, complex work"

Xilinx own Solarflare which has huge market penetration in fintechs and CDNs for their low-latency NICs (think 50+%).

They own Alveo which is their AI accelerator cards.

They own smartstorage which is getting adoption.

With the acquisiton Xilinx/AMD will own the data-center with a one-stop solution for networking, storage, bespoke accelerators, x86 or GPUs.

That doesn't even take into account 5g/security/automotive."
6/30/2021 14:17,stocks,"They probably mean in total market share, the value of the semi conductors industry as a market has a current value and neither stock can go above that total value unless more money is spent towards that industry or another player loses some of their market share.

AMD has a lower market cap so in principle for it to double requires less of a relative increase in market share than Nvidia. 

I'm not saying either is any better than the other, personally I have Amd but nvidia has been railing the sp500 so I cant really diss it."
6/30/2021 12:20,stocks,That's ok. You don't have to buy the full stock. 10 dollars or whatever currency you have will get you started. Or you can set aside whatever you feel comfortable with before purchasing the stocks. You're only poor right now. Hell in 5 years you might be richer than you've ever expected. You got this.
6/30/2021 15:07,stocks,"Negative ghostrider.  I've been watching them both like a hawk since end of 2020.  They both have been OOS everywhere and the ONLY way to get either is by winning the Best Buy notification race or use auto-buying bots.  Actually, the opposite is true due to AMD being quicker to re-price causing them to sell out a bit slower.

People paying top dollar for autobuying bots for Nvidia 3080s.  More so than AMD.  This is due to Nvidia's gaming and ETH mining performance AND their super low MSRP of $600-700.  Comparable AMD starts at $1k.  And I believe that will translate into more profit per unit for AMD.  Could be wrong tho."
6/30/2021 18:40,stocks,I had the wrong data. Thanks for the correction.
6/30/2021 19:56,stocks,"I guess my comment was more directed towards the general sentiment I’m seeing in this thread and others where people say “AMD has more room to grow” because they both make GPUs and that’s all there is to it.

AMD is already a >$100B market cap company and I don’t see what their strategy is to grow significantly beyond that in the long run, never mind Nvidia’s (admittedly expensive) level today. For instance, they recently acquired Xilinx, an FPGA company. Do FPGAs make a lot of money? Are FPGAs deployed in data centers and used in AI training/inference today? No. Could that change? Maybe, but the last decade of Intel’s Altera acquisition and the lack of FPGA solutions in the ML space shows otherwise. Never mind the programming nightmare that they are.

Having said all that, I think in the short term AMD could still grow from the momentum of their CPU and gaming business, but they need to demonstrate some alternative markets/revenue streams to justify any real comparison to Nvidia. I do hold some AMD for this reason and would recommend some AMD exposure for this reason, but Nvidia is still my dream FAA**N**G company."

6/30/2021 14:31,stocks,"A lot of people do! It’s a logical thought process, albeit logic isn’t always ‘right’. 

https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/what-does-it-mean-when-a-game-has-amd-or-nvidia-branding/

This article does a somewhat adequate job of explaining it (if you shift through the irrelevant tech breakdown content that’s painted as a fact, but is actually highly situational)

there’s a line toward the end that does say, ‘I’ve seen AMD branded games that ended up running better on Nvidia GPUs, or Nvidia promoted games that end up performing better on AMD GPUs’- this is so amazingly accurate, it made me laugh. 

Here’s one of Nvidias options as a developer looking to work with them, so you can get a rough statement from the horses mouth- 

https://developer.nvidia.com/indie-spotlight

Note how it specifically refers to ‘GeForce marketing channels’- just because a game doesn’t come up in your GeForce supported section, or doesn’t have its own reference in a game ready driver, doesn’t mean your GPU won’t run it! 

That link is about applying for partnership, but they do also reach out to successful games, as I’m sure AMD do too, but my personal experience is limited to Nvidia. Of course it’s highly unlikely that one will take you on if their competitor already has, they want the guise of exclusivity, rather than cooperation

Also in the brief searching I’ve just been doing, giving credit where it’s due AMD seem to have made significant progress regarding devrel since I left the field, but Nvidia still takes the cake on that one. 

Either way, whoever you invest in, they’re not going to fade into insignificance- personally I’d be just as happy to work with either of them"
6/30/2021 14:38,stocks,"True, but Nvidia make over half their revenue on GPUs and considering the ‘Nvidia or AMD’ I focused on their most overlapping products, if they’d said ‘AMD or Intel’ I would’ve focused on microchips and CPUs. 

It’s very clear in what I’ve written that I’m referring to which outperforms which in accordance to the comment I was replying to, and in relation to sectors that overlap, not sure why you’d draw the comparison between the two companies for things that don’t.

Edit- forgot to mention that the ‘over half their revenue’ being made from GPUs isn’t specific to gaming ones, GPUs are used for loads of reasons, the underlying compsci behind them is the same. Just different variations to perform different tasks more efficiently, I wouldn’t be surprised if a significant amount of those GPUs weren’t commercial sales, but corporate

Edit 2- a colleague I discussed this with pointed out that GPU’s probably make up about 80% of their revenue, considering the majority of their work in AI and data centre fields, is also providing GPUs."
6/30/2021 16:54,stocks,"Sounds cute but for the foreseeable future, Intel will always win as long as datacenter grows. Check back in 3 years and that may change."

Intel lost **30%** of their data center as of their last quarter.  It is increasingly hard to ignore just how fast both AMD and NVDA are making inroads.

6/30/2021 19:09,stocks,"Lucrative yes but not exactly a huge growth driver. Very broad end markets use FPGAs and while there are areas of secular growth (AI, data center, 5G, auto), there are also a lot of more cyclical exposures as well.

See Intel's purchase of Altera for $15 billion back in 2015, revenue has been basically flat (some of this maybe has to do with Intel).

Xilinx has also had quite a bit of lumpiness in their revenue growth in recent years - but incredibly profitable nonetheless (70% GM). Will def. be accretive to AMD's financials."
6/30/2021 15:43,stocks,"Gotcha.  I consider availability and volume to be completely different things although I can see how the terms may overlap slightly.

The MSRP jump is like 100%.  With volume comes more costs to produce (albeit descending per unit - but still more overall).  But with just double MSRP there are no inherent costs, just pure profit.

But I honestly don't know what the volume numbers are here and if they are ridiculous enough then I would have to agree with you."

6/30/2021 17:11,stocks,AMD - Those were your words I believe and yes it did trade sideways for a bit from June 1st to June 16 before it’s recent run! At the same timeframe NVDA was running up. I favor both stocks for whatever it’s worth!
6/30/2021 14:41,stocks,Don’t know enough about it personally to say something; however i would note that Nvidia is disabling crypto mining capability for some of their processors- there’s enough demand for them outside of crypto to keep going
6/30/2021 15:41,stocks,"I mean the person I responded to about the specific found it helpful, and the comment was meant for him, not a thorough investment strategy, just a break down of how Nvidia come out on top of where they overlap. I even specified in the first paragraph that I was talking about the disparity between them in game development. It’s literally the only reason to put the two companies together. 

comparing their other industries, such as Nvidias AI, and AMD’s CPUs is like asking for a comparison between McDonald’s and The Ivy, both foods but vastly different worlds, the knowledge required to make an educated guess as to the developments AMD will make in CPU’s doesn’t equate to the knowledge required to asses whether that will have a stronger return than Nvidias branching into AI, they’re fundamentally different markets.

Edit: change the example to McDonald’s and a grocery store, as that’s probably a more fitting analogy to describe the gap in the industry"

Someone truly dedicated, with a knowledge of the tech could probably find a work around but it would take some serious tampering. 

They do have their own cards designed for mining as well, so I think it’s probably more of a plot to move miners toward buying those ones, rather than using the ones designed for gaming."
6/30/2021 0:00,stocks,"UK platforms for stock investing Anyone know of any good UK platforms (besides Freetrade. I use them right now but they keep on sectioning off different stocks to higher paying members, which is annoying) that one can use in relation to investing, whether that's as an individual retail investor, or working with a particular fund of sorts.

Main things that I'm looking for:

1) Relatively low trading/commission fees or membership costs

2) A platform that has many, as well as a wide variety of ETFs, and US and UK listed stocks and shares. These shares would ideally be well organised and categorised as well, or the platform would at least enable users to make their own categories and lists on the app/website

3) Reputable and reliable. This platform doesn't attempt to pull fast ones on heavily traded stocks, and it also protects its investors via different regulations, insurance policies etc

4) Something where it's relatively quick and simple to liquidate funds

Any help would be sweet, thanks."
6/30/2021 11:25,stocks,"When looking for platforms in the UK, keep your eyes peeled and avoid CFDs. Companies like eToro and trading212 will quietly sell you a CFD instead of the actual asset when you buy on margin.

If you want a legit and above board company, Hargreaves Landsdown, IG, or Fidelity International and good choices, but come with high fees. Consider these companies if you're trading with large sums. 

App based platforms like Freetrade and Revolut are 'free' apps similar to RobinHood in the US, however, payment for order flow isn't legal in the UK. These apps get paid through alternative means such as pay-walling popular stocks or charging regular fees. They are regulated in the UK as e-money, meaning your money is kept separate from business accounts and is ring fenced in the event of administration. They are good for fun money, but not large sums."
6/30/2021 18:10,stocks,"212 aren't accepting new customers just now. Not to mention they're under fire for share lending. Though it's up to you if you care about that. They do however have a free ISA (with no lending) so may be worth an account with just for that if you're prepared to wait. 

I'm not sure how much you have to invest but Freetrade premium is actually free if you leave at least £4K in your account and also includes an ISA too. Freetrade don't lend either. 

There is also the option of IBKR directly if you have the funds. A portfolio over £20000 has a minimum monthly fee of £10. So the same as Freetrade. But any commission you pay is deducted from that monthly fee. Their fixed commission option includes all fees including FX and isn't much more than the FX fees alone you're already paying Freetrade anyway. However, they don't offer an ISA and I'm unsure exactly where they stand with share lending. 

I'm currently with Freetrade and awaiting 212 for their ISA. Freetrade aren't perfect but at least they want customers have have pretty good customer service I'm my experience. The down side is for a full service they aren't actually free and £10 a month for a service that doesn't even come with PC charting software is actually very expensive. They also have a maximum order size for US stocks of £25000 which is a joke but they are currently reviewing this and will be increasing it at some point."

We’ve already seen this play out with the rise of the dollar stores over the past several years.  I would love to be able to invest in Aldi right now as I think they’re very well positioned for an inflationary market but they’re a private company.

(Sorry too lazy to do metric conversion).  We have what are referred to as “dollar stores” that cater to the poorest shoppers and have taken these shoppers from Walmart. The most popular would be Dollar General. Look at their store growth and stock chart. They cater to the poorest shoppers by doing things like offering smaller sizes. The unit cost may be higher but if you’re living paycheck to paycheck you can’t afford 64oz of laundry detergent, you want to buy 12oz to get you through the week. Their stores are small, no frills, low overhead and they outcompete Walmart. They only sell non-perishable food though so a discount grocer like Aldi that sells perishable food should still have room to benefit as inflation pushes more shoppers down market from traditional grocery stores into discount stores. The dollar store growth story I feel is priced in already."
6/30/2021 10:05,stocks,"Support for my thesis on discount grocers:

Recent evidence suggests there's more food inflation to come. According to calculations from the Earth Policy Institute, Washington, food prices will likely be higher in the second quarter, with soybean prices hitting 15-year highs and wheat and corn seven-year highs. When this year's grain harvest begins in May, world grain stocks will be down to 59 days of consumption -- the lowest level in 30 years, EPI noted.

If you’re a Whole Foods shopper I’m sure ACI and KR look like discount grocers but they’re different business models from an Aldi or Lidl. Those stores are very efficient, they offer fewer product selection, they don’t stock items individually they fill shelves with the boxes items ship in, you bag your own groceries, you buy bags or bring your own, you deposit quarters to get your shopping cart so that you return it yourself to get your quarters back. Very lean operations = low prices."
6/30/2021 13:55,stocks,"Dollar Generals are kind of their own unique category though. They are basically where there aren't grocery stores, and while dollar stores mostly sell non consumables like plates, party supplies, toys, along with soda, candy and canned goods. Dollar Generals sell full sized cereal boxes, frozen food, some dairy products, pet food and even beer."
6/30/2021 11:29,stocks,There is only ten cents of wheat in a loaf of bread and the plastic bag that contains your tortilla chips costs more than the corn. Grain prices are high due to the storms last summer in the Midwest plus the drought in Brazil.Meat prices however are high due to the cutbacks in production last year and the high cost of feed. The price for soybean meal is over $400 per ton and it is usually half that.
6/30/2021 10:17,stocks,"I’m not a huge fan as I look deeper. Declining sales, rising operating expenses, increasing debt, turnover in the C-suite, and their own 2021 outlook is a 5-7% decrease in revenue… I might just put this on my watch list and see if it gets down into the $15-$16 range so the dividend yield is over 5%."
6/30/2021 12:25,stocks,Ahh then tesco and asda are the next level up in price and asda = Walmart
6/30/2021 13:04,stocks,Just to be clear KR is massive and owns food 4 less and pay-less supermarkets
6/30/2021 14:08,stocks,My hometown has four DG’s. The longest drive to the nearest grocery store from one is five minutes. Two of them are in the shadow of a grocery store. I have also seen plenty of what you’re talking about though where they are located in areas that lack a grocery store and people would have to drive maybe 20 minutes to the nearest one.
6/30/2021 12:10,stocks,So what you’re saying is food prices are going up…
6/30/2021 10:25,stocks,I just had a quick look at the business and a 8.58 PE ration with a 4.2% dividend puts it on the watch list. They operate in the traditional grocer space which I think will struggle to compete with discount grocers and Walmart in an inflationary environment but on the face of it those financials looked compelling.
6/30/2021 13:14,stocks,"Appreciate the insight, I didn’t know that much about KR and think of them only as Kroger branded grocery stores."
6/30/2021 15:12,stocks,"I like DG. Their business model generates a ton of cash and new stores typically become cash flow positive in a year. Outside of any down price grocery trends, I like the stock."
6/30/2021 10:49,stocks,"For SPTN as well as BGS, have to look at the results before March 2020 to get a feel for their real fundamentals.  March 2020 and going forward were great years for both.  People stayed home in droves and foresook restaurants. Now both companies have to return to their pre-Covid numbers.  Not saying they won't take off again if another variant of Covid hits.

Their current divies, etc are not bad but should wait for a pullback."
6/30/2021 13:19,stocks,"I started looking at KR after buffets bought it. It's extremely interesting. P/S 0.22 with massive operating cashflow. If you include curbside, they're in the top 10 largest e-commerce companies by revenue. They have a lot of brands and are spread out geographically."

6/30/2021 0:00,stocks,"What is going on with Cigna (CI) I've bought and sold and bought CI at a loss and am continuing to watch.  The company profile is decent, growth prospects are good and it's trading at a low P/E.  Research shows good growth prospects and there's a small dividend for the stock.  But I watch it continue to take a downward trajectory.  Analysts give it a green light.  It seems to defy all the publicly available research.

A little more DD: EVA, Thompson Reuters, Jefferson and McClean all rate it a buy or conservative stock.  I don't think I've seen every one of these reports align like this before.  The only one is Trading Central noting a short term decline and long term Bullish.

UNLESS there is something else going on that nobody is publicly relaying or I have missed this seems primed to explode to the upside.  Does anyone know if there are struggles within this company that I can't find?  This stock doesn't make sense to me.

Discosure: I currently own the stock and re-bought back in about 1% loss ago after pulling out of a 5% loss previously and watching it go down further.  Thought I found a good re-entry.  Maybe not.

Might update if there's a 5% move either way."

6/30/2021 9:31,stocks,"As you said its conservative equity, revenues grow mid single digit so inline with GDP and its already up a lot this year. So nothing is going on, it already did very well. Not sure what are you expecting."

6/30/2021 15:54,stocks,"I guess because those others are trading at a P/E around 20 with a forward of 20 and CI is sitting at 13 with a forward of 10.  Maybe I’m relying on P/E too heavily.  However, from a valuation point of view (earnings per share) CI is in line with both HUM and UNH.  It just looks under valued and I can’t figure it out.

I was just scrolling the sub and noticed a handful of people talking shit on technical analysis, it doesn’t work, it has never been proven to work, etc..

I want all you TA bashers to know that you don’t know what you’re talking about. 

There are some aspects of TA that I deem utterly useless like “head and shoulders” or “cup and handle”. 

As far as the basics go, like channel trading, support and resistances, rsi indicator, these things are incredibly accurate if you have a solid game plan of entries, exits, and stop losses.

I have a watchlist of about 150 stocks that I believe are fundamentally solid that I have been trading in and out of for years. Made almost 400% last year and i’m up over 100% this year even though my trading has drastically slowed.

For those of you that think TA is just squiggly lines on a chalkboard, you are very wrong. I have roughly 3 years worth of proof  and so do many others that know how to use it correctly and manage their risk exposure."
6/30/2021 7:50,stocks,"Behavior sets can be recognized and exploited to an extent. But those behavior sets are informed by fundamentals.

It is useless to recognize a pattern of trading if you can't recognize the catalysts for that pattern. And more importantly, when the underlying facts of the security no longer support continuation."

6/30/2021 9:59,stocks,"I think a blend of TA and FA would be pretty cool. Like have a handful of fundamentally sound companies, and allocate a percentage of your money to TA type trades/options"
6/30/2021 14:12,stocks,"I've also had negative sentiment towards my TA but doesn't matter. 

People who invest are usually taught by Ben Graham, Buffet and the likes. They all say they same thing about TA. Sadly they are wrong just because they don't understand it. 


But don't allow it to get you down. I've been investing based on TA and very little FA very successfully (both stocks and forex), I even teach a good bunch of traders. If it works for you, great... but don't even bother convincing others. Do you and you'll be very far."

6/30/2021 7:37,stocks,Do you have any recommendations for beginners using TA? I just ordered Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets: A Comprehensive Guide to Trading Methods and Applications by John Murphy. Been reading some entry level books on trading as well. I think I Have a good framework for options but I don’t entirely understand the greeks. Im more of a bullish investor but Im strongly convinced we’re heading into bear territory and I need to make a strategy accordingly.
6/30/2021 12:21,stocks,"Personally, I don’t really care about TA because I buy for the long term (5+ years). My reasoning is mainly that if I’m trying to squeeze out $0.01s of an “undervalued” company, then I am probably being overly optimistic/ confident. 

I think TA is something that can be useful for more short term investors (0 mos. - 1 year) however."

6/30/2021 8:40,stocks,What is a good basic intro to read that covers these core concepts and how to use them. I know nothing about TA and want at least high level exposure.

6/30/2021 8:46,stocks,I started with a lot more than 10k but you’re 100% correct. A larger amount of capital is much harder to manage.
6/30/2021 7:44,stocks,"Yea, you’re saying the exact same thing everyone else says. Like word for word. 

The market has without a doubt been on easy mode for anyone going long but anyone going long around feb of this year has gotten smoked as far as mid caps are concerned. You’re not taking into account that people can trade off TA when the market is tanking. Many people like myself went short on U, fubo, TSLA, etc., and made a good chunk of change. All from TA. 

I never looked at job reports, economic data, inflation, etc.. Just the chart, volume, dark pool activity, and option flow."
6/30/2021 8:42,stocks,"I don’t really have any recommendations man. I got lucky and was taught by someone that is just incredible at it. 

There are a handful of people on Twitter that are great at charting. You can add them and look at the charts they post just so you get familiar with what clean charts look like. Maybe even track their trades and figure out when their charts were successful and when they failed.

Of course I would never recommend you follow any of their trades. Just learn from them."

6/30/2021 17:20,stocks,"Psychedelic medicine is overdue for another breakout. All of the recent scientific studies, regulatory action and mass media coverage have been incredibly positive. Compass Pathways recently completed the world's largest study on psychedelics (22 sites, 10 countries, 216 participants. Phase 2B psilocybin for treatment resistant depression) and will report results before the end of the year. California's psych decrim bill just passed assembly yesterday and could become law by September.

The amount of scientific and anecdotal evidence that certain psychedelics have incredibly beneficial therapeutic potential is overwhelming. People who claim there's no profit to be had don't know what they're talking about. Ketamine clinics are generating significant revenue now and will be able to administer MDMA and Psilocybin therapy as FDA trials complete (MAPS' MDMA for PTSD is in 2nd round of phase 3 trials demonstrating astounding efficicacy) and local regulations loosen in places like Oregon, where all drugs have been decriminalized.

This industry is being slept on massively. I ended 5 years of poly drug abuse with a single psilocybin trip. I did a complete 180 and have been sober for over a decade. Makes it easy to hold these stocks when you believe as strongly in this medicine as I do.

These substances have been used across cultures and continents for millennia. The science is now confirming what some already know.

Given the massive revenues of traditional oil companies I expect them to begin to take a leadership role in the transition to cleaner energy once the oil market starts to contract. I guarantee today's major energy players are not going to sit by desperately holding onto oil and go bankrupt as the nature of energy markets shift.

6/30/2021 17:13,stocks,"As a whole industry, absolutely. But coming from someone who's been in this industry for well over a decade, it's really hard to determine which publicly traded cybersecurity companies will not only stay afloat but thrive. New companies form in this industry all the effing time. I'd see it every year at RSA Conference in San Francisco. Some will grow into large companies, even public ones; others will see growth but get acquired by large corp, and others will see growth then fizzle out. The kicker: you don't know who it will be.

Let's take Crowdstrike, for example. Their protection capabilities are nothing stellar. To be honest, I can think of a few other vendors I would pick first before deploying their stack. But they're crushing it with their numbers, but not in a good way. I have current coworkers who worked there and former coworkers who currently work there, and they over-work their sales team to the bone, Wolf of Wall Street style. They have an insanely good LTV:CAC ratio, which means not only do they find new business, they renew a ton of that same business each year. But what happens when a lot of the sales staff are tired of constantly rising quota's without increase in pay? What happens when new hires get fed one thing and then experience another? What happens when multiple competitors, who already provide better protection, scale their sales teams? If we go by how good the products and services are, Crowdstrike is not one to invest long term in.

If I was confident in a company in this industry, believe me, I'd already be investing in them, I'm privy to a lot more info in this industry than most. But there isn't a single publicly traded cybersecurity company that I'd vouch for. All the ones that I would vouch for are all private. Perhaps if Crowdstrike starts to acquire the best technology from the hottest cybersecurity start-ups, I'd invest then, but until that happens, I'm staying away. And look, I'm not a short term trader, when I buy, I hold. I personally think CRWD is way too overvalued and I think that over the next couple years, customers will see that their security stack is not as good as some competitors (if they don't acquire new technology, of course).

And SentinelOne. They don't even generate $100 mil in revenue yet they have an $11 bil market cap??? Are you fucking kidding me? The private security company I work for does a quarter billion yet if we had the same 110 P/S ratio, we'd be worth $27 billion, and my options would be worth well over a million bucks. And that's not even considering their security stack. They don't offer sandboxing for analysis (pretty big), they're prone to false positives (per contacts of mine), reports of quality issues due to rapid releases, and a minor issue that customers have to deploy updates in batches of 50 at a time. So I don't get why people even deploy that fucking company, man. We beat them out on deals all the time."

And reading it was like reading the Cloudflare product catalog...And I think that, that will very quickly start to get people to say, the old approach of just buying a whole bunch of boxes and sticking them in an IT closet somewhere, that doesn't work anymore because here's a document that says it doesn't.\_”

And, **Okta**’s CEO Todd McKinnon had this to say on the company’s earnings call last week: “\_I was meeting with the Chief Security Officer at a very well-known 3-letter agency....And basically, what they were saying is it sounded like -- and literally, a marketing script that Okta would say. They said we were a victim of SolarWinds. They're worried about these other attacks, these exchange leaks, these exchange attacks -- these exchange attacks, etc. We have to go to Zero Trust, and identity is at the core of it all.\_”

**$NET** also have a specific service to help companies with international compliance. Prince spoke about it a couple quarters ago and how excited he was for it's future."

The new Battlefield game is launching later this year, the expectations around it are unreal and, although there are no pre order data yet, just based off general hype and the gamer-groups I know, it may very well be the best selling BF game (and also it seems EA plans to give it the Apex treatment, making it a live service game with at least a 5 year life cycle, which means another great constant revenue stream for them).

Rumours on DICE (an EA studio) starting development on Battlefront 3 (a Star Wars multiplayer game similar to battlefield) and Respawn (creators of Apex) working on the sequel for Jedi Fallen order (the first game sold 10M copies in the first 4 months).

Anyone can brew beer in their garage.  At the end of a month of boiling, fermentation and bottling you have shitty beer which probably cost you more to make per bottle than the price of grocery store beer.   Pot has effectively no entry cost.  There are other barriers to grow your own but $$ isn’t one of them.   Commercial pot producers must pay for land lease, farming equip, R&D, packaging, and transport to retailers.

6/30/2021 11:27,stocks,"If you hold them for short periods you have expanded downside risk, and for long term holds you are at a mathematical disadvantage due to both high expense ratios, and the fact that it's a leverage of % change (so if what the leveraged fund is tracking goes down 10% one day, then returns 11.1% the next day to net 0 over the two days, the leveraged version went down 30% then up 33.3%, which is net -6.666%)

People hone in on the second because in effect you are leveraged to a higher multiple for negative moves (sort of), but if you still expect a strong sector performance leveraged ETFs can still be good holds provided you're comfortable with the risks."
6/30/2021 11:21,stocks,Just add risk from my understanding and mayb a little higher fee.
6/30/2021 14:32,stocks,"The key thing to remember about leveraged funds is that they are designed to be day trading products, not long term investments. They only aim to replicate a single day's performance, and as such there are situations (i.e. volatile growth) where the underlying stock(s) can trend up, but the leveraged fund doesn't match its growth, trades sideways, or even goes down. 

Generally speaking, if you're not very familiar and comfortable with the underlying mechanisms of how these funds work and achieve leverage, and what can cause their long term rise or fall, they probably shouldn't be in your portfolio."

6/30/2021 5:44,stocks,"When you sell a covered call it will show up as a negative position. So it would be like -1 contracts for example. 

You can’t force the owner of the call you sold to exercise when you want, but you can close your covered call trade but then buying the same option you sold to close. So if you sold a call for ABC co on july 21, you’d sell to open, and collect the option premium. If you decide to sell you shares you’d still have the liability of the call option you sold, meaning you still owe ABC at the strike price on July 21 if it were in the money. 

To end you liability you’d find the same option you sold to open, but instead on the order ticket you’d select buy to close. Which would replace the option you sold and you’d be free to move on. The owner may or may not exercise the option whenever. It’s rare it happens before the exercise date though."
6/30/2021 6:57,stocks,You have to buy to close the contract you sold first. I recommend you set the strike price higher to a price you are comfortable lossing your shares. Less premium but also less risk.
6/30/2021 6:02,stocks,So it's almost not worth it because if it runs in the money then that call would cost more money then right?
6/30/2021 7:01,stocks,And only sell them on big up days
6/30/2021 6:39,stocks,"Well yeah if your strike is 55 and the stock is trading at 60 you’re 5 dollars in the money, meaning you’re right to buy at 55 is giving immediate value of 5 a share, you know? That would make the options worth probably 5 per share minimum, plus the other factors which price options like time/volatility. 

Covered calls are great if your goals are aligned. What’s worth it or not is each investors opinion. So I can’t say. 

What I’ll say in my opinion is covered calls are a great strategy for a high yielding portfolio if your goal is to yield 6-10 percent in a lower risk type way. You won’t be  owning many multibaggers this way but you can yield solid. By selling covered calls on dividend paying stocks at slightly higher strikes than you own you can guarantee either yield, or capital gains. If ABC pays 4 percent, and you periodically sell covered calls, and collect the option premium, you’ll get to collect the premium and dividend, and if the yield is 4 percent, you can collect 4 percent in option premium, which would be a yield of 8 percent. If the shares get called away and sold at the strike, by choosing a strike that’s a bit slightly higher you may get called but maybe at a 6 percent gain, which can be redeployed into more similar stocks. The key is finding good safe ones, not ones that could collapse 60 percent, as in a fad company running out of steam, 

 That’s kind of the strategy with covered calls really I think you want to employ."

6/30/2021 17:13,stocks,"I am in a **fantasy stocks league** with my family. The gist of it is that you get $100,000 (paper money) to spend evenly across 10 assets that are traded on the NYSE to start the year. We started it on 12/31/2020, and the competition is to see whose portfolio is worth the most at the end of the year. Winner gets $100 from each entrant.

There's some rules about dividends and acquisitions/mergers, but don't worry about that.

At the half-way point in the year on July 1 (and only on July 1), you can sell up to four of your holdings and buy new assets. For example, I bought $10,000 worth of $MSFT to start the year, which is currently worth $12,200. I could elect to sell that stock and buy a different asset. 

Must own 10 different holdings.

I am currently in last place (measly 8.20% gain YTD), and need some growth! The great thing about this league (vs a real portfolio) is that risk tolerance really doesn't matter - it's win or go home!

I have a very detailed and intricate portfolio tracker as the league manager, with all sorts of calculations and figures for every holding in the league.

**So I ask the community: which stocks/ETFs should I sell, and which should I buy?**

My current holdings: 

* Cloudflare Inc ($NET)
* Microsoft Corporation ($MSFT)
* Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD)
* Nio Inc ($NIO)
* Square Inc ($SQ)
* Walt Disney Co ($DIS)
* iShares Global Clean Energy ETF ($ICLN)
* ARK Genomic Revolution ETF ($ARKG)
* ARK Innovation ETF ($ARKK)
* Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ)

Been using ROKU personally forever and was an early investor.  Clearly should have purchased more shares.  What I do hold is up significantly.

I'm stuck with Comcast, literally no other options.  The only benefit with Roku, the Xfinity app is pretty stellar.  It's basically a Roku app version of their X1 platform.  It has been in beta forever.  When the FCC said they were going to let customers own their own cable boxes or alternatives, it spurred this development and was finally a break for the consumer.

Financially smart but not financially wise consumers also are really bad at justifying financial decisions. They see record low rates and think they need to lock in a house purchase, not realizing that the low rates are just driving up the price of the house and you really arent that much better.

Lastly, from my connections in the biz cash out refinances are at an all time high right now. I have no faith in the average consumer to be smart with that money. 

&#x200B;

Overall, the only ones that should be concern are those leveraging up to the hilt to get in or those who made a big stretch to buy a house. If you already own then nothing to worry about. Your home is NOT an investment - it's a place you pay to live - remember that and youll be ok.

I don't foresee landlords *not* taking the opportunity to give themselves raises based on the current inflated market costs *especially* because they can justify it based on recouping lost income over the last year. To compound the problem units that are returning to the market are going to drip-feed due to the court processes involved in evictions so the market won't flood enough to put power into the buyer/renter's hands."

6/30/2021 0:00,stocks,"Sentinel One - This will go HAM I have experience in the cyber-security industry.  I'm excited S1 is going public tomorrow.

Crowdstrike stands in a league of it's own.  That's why they are valued at like $58 billion.  They use a threatgraph of all their clients endpoints meta data, storing only meta data (like, this person opened a word document), and have the second largest data footprint on AWS (Netflix is #1...with movies...and insanely huge ops).

SentinelOne has a similar approach.  The platform is slick, has a nice Ui, and is created by israeli cybersecurity experts.  It has less data to work with to correlate attacks (which will change as they add customers and time), but still has amazing potential as they have huge clients (think, one used to be the biggest company in the world...). It works on LINUX (servers!) which is a huge advantage, because CrowdStrike does not \*EDIT: aparently I am wrong, crowdstrike does now work on linux\*.  However, they don't use in-person threat hunting (or it is not quite as developed) they use Ai threat-hunting (most deem inferior, but still amazing and comparable efficacy).

100+% revenue growth YOY, $135Mish revenue.  Coming out valued at approx $8B, vs CS's $58B.

one of maybe 3 total solutions that are truly effective against ransomware/advanced nation state type attacks on endpoints at the highest level (think, S1, crowdstrike, and carbon black).

it's cheaper than crowdstrike, and crowdstrike is expensive, but a more hollistic platform.  S1 will be for companies that want to save some money but still get top tier endpoint protection, and will eventually compete head to head as the sole challenger.  Also some clients like the ability to have endpoint protection for servers running on linux, not sure if crowdstrike has that yet. Think, Mercedes vs BMW.

My personal price target (maybe 40-50 per share) before I think it's over valued is $25B mkt cap, so I think this is a decent 2x play over the next year, possibly more if Biden admin invests more and more in cybersecurity, since S1 and CS are the two best solutions, and both are used by govt. already."

Hence why it is so difficult to find a true mentor in trading.  Only advice I can give is pick 3-4 stocks in each sector learn how they move do your TA on them get all your DD done make notes subscribe to company investor relations and keep up on the news of them and their competitors.  For me I trade TSLA AAPL and BA nearly every day. ( I trade options ) so that adds a bit to the complexity, if that's your goal learn how the options move and which ones pay which ones lag the moves. If you keep it simple and Back test all of your TA everyday for the last year  and then go back 4 years ( TSLA ) would be a bad choice beyond that for options trading and from there you can expand to more and more tickers 

TLDR: Learning to fish yourself will be your greatest strength.  There are a few good resources on YouTube the bald guy there for options trading tasty trade has videos that are pretty good and TD Ameritrade has both videos and live webinars with Q and A sessions.

Assuming I'm carrying a margin balance and I want to purchase non-marginable OTC securities, do I first need to zero out my margin debt in order to free up cash for the purchase?

The alternative would be to sell shares to pay back the margin and free up sufficient cash to purchase the OTC shares, then re-buy the marginable shares on margin (assuming it's permissible to take on margin debt while owning OTC shares). This would cause a taxable event I'd prefer to postpone.

So if you had $1500 in total non-otc stocks, that is $1000 in your own money and $500/$1000 margin used. But if you bought $100 OTC, you know have $900 in your own money for non-otc stocks, $600/$900 margin used."

Everybody has to sell their stock and end up with another! doesn't matter how many times they trade with some one but give them a time limit to sell and buy from each other.

Had the business/investment not failed the money could've remained tied up for years making so-so returns.

The stimis upped shipping but those are long gone now. So what will be the catalyst for upward movement that’s obvious to see? What is their rotation on contract negotiations? How quickly can they pass along fuel costs? If it can be done in a timely manner without losing biz they may have the upper hand on other shipping companies.

6/29/2021 20:52,stocks,"They are absolutely one of the best run companies in the country and they've been America's great little secret over the past 10 years.

I currently own 1700 shares and 70 call options in the stock @   290 december strike price.  I also learned 30 call options @ 250 October strike price.

Currently business is booming and they were brought down with the other transports but they always rise to the top in the long run.

I strongly encourage you to start listening to their quarter reports and you will hear during the conference calls that they are running an absolute Superior business to other companies.   Their operating ratio is unreal and their cash on hand is awesome and they carry very little debt.   

They've been managed by the same family for several decades and our growth potential is still very high.

If you ever tune in to see CNBC the morons on there Will recommend inferior companies all the time and it gets really old but it's actually, cool to hear these quote-unquote professionals recommend other companies.   It's almost as if the paid professionals don't have the damn time to read over the income statements of these companies.  It's like they're a bunch of robots with drool running down their chin and all they can ever say is ""buy FedEx and UPS.""

Old Dominion is non-union and to answer your question they're absolutely undervalued currently I would say probably by about 10%.   If you look at the growth metrics over the next two years and do some simple calculations there's no reason the stock should not be trading at at least 375 a share in 2 years.   I say that confidently but we all know that the economy could be run into the ground or there could be some major on for seeing events."

Forget about this stimis and realize that people are returning to work and many people are shipping more items than ever before because of the convenience.

They have a fuel surcharge , so they really don't care about fuel costs.

Their operating ratio is better than any other company I can find in the business.

They are buying back stock.

They started issuing a dividend about 4 years ago.

They are family owned and non-union.

You're almost making a recommendation for them to do something so they don't lose business yet all they do is gain business and market share every single year and they've been doing so for like 15 years running."

6/30/2021 0:00,stocks,"Long term company research & analysis on SoFi (filter through the noise) I’ve seen a ton of posts about trading SOFI and short squeezes etc. but I’m investing in SoFi for the LONG TERM and here’s why:

1. SoFi actually had positive EBITDA in Q1 and is forecasting $27M in EBITDA for 2021! How many high growth, recent IPO’s can say that!  SoFi is forecasting $254M EBITDA in ’22, $484M ’23 ($1.17B in ’25 but that’s a bit of a wild card since it’s so far in the future…).  That’s a 162% CAGR over 3 years and 113% CAGR over 5.  They exceeded guidance in Q4’20 and in Q1’21 !!!  Their forecast is also somewhat conservative since it excludes the impact of the pending bank charter acquisition which could increase these #’s.  It also excludes some of the new offerings that were just announced like Auto Loans and IPO investing (underwriting).
2. Rapid revenue and customer growth! Forecast of $980M in 2021 to $2.1B in 2023 is a 29% CAGR over 3 years (28% CAGR over 5 years).  2.28M unique customers in Q1 and targeting 3M customers by the end of 2021.  They have a great track record of upselling existing customers (very low cost to upsell vs. acquire) with about 1/4 of their customers using multiple products, this should only improve as they add more product lines (like auto loans…and hopefully options soon!)
3. Galileo technology platform actually turns a major cost center into a profit center and makes them a true Fintech vs. just an online bank like Ally etc.  Galileo is expected to grow 55% CAGR from 2020-2025 with an estimated 62% margin.  This gives them a great B2B model and de-risks a 100% banking model.  Galileo is the Fintech engine behind 70M accounts (Q1 #’s) and customers include Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, Revolt etc. Galileo’s APIs power functionalities including account set-up, funding, direct deposit, ACH transfer, IVR, early paycheck direct deposit, bill pay, transaction notifications, check balance, and point of sale authorization as well as dozens of other capabilities.
4. Future bank charter with the pending acquisition of Golden Pacific Bancorp will help juice profitability and revenue growth and lowers their cost of capital.  This is expected to grow profits from $484M in 2023 to $718M in 2023.  If their estimates are correct AND the acquisition goes through that would increase the 3-year earnings CAGR from 162% up to 198%!  This deal should close by the end of 2021
5. Solid leadership:  Anthony Noto, CEO has a strong background in Finance with Goldman Sachs and the NFL (CFO) AND Technology from Twitter (COO).  Chris Lapointe, CFO also has a great mix of Tech (Uber) and finance from Goldman Sachs.  Similar story with the rest of the executive team.  Strong marketing with SoFi stadium in LA (Superbowl venue) and SoFi’s investment team is frequently on CNBC (Liz Young etc.)
6. Rising interest rates is actually POSITIVE for SoFi!  Banks pay customers a relatively low interest rate on short term deposits and charge customers a higher interest rate on longer term loans.  As rates rise their margins increase.  With rates at record lows, a rapidly recovering economy and inflation on the horizon rates should only go higher (maybe substantially and much faster than normal).  The bank charter only enhances this….
7. I invested a little in SoFi (via IPOE) originally after it pulled back and wanted to invest more BUT before I did, I opened accounts at SoFi to verify that it’s all that they say it is.  So I opened a checking account, 2% cash back credit card, active investing account, automated investing account.  This is the real deal:  Products are SUPER competitive (2% cash back on a CC with NO annual fee!), Checking account pays 0.25% with no fees, $0 stock trades for active investing and direct access to IPOs (I participated in their 1st 4 IPOs today - 6/29) and no cost automated advisor investing.  They really treat you like a “member” and customer service has been great so far.  The mobile App is very user friendly with a ton of added features (credit score, education etc.).
   1. If you own SoFi stock for the long term and you’re not a customer yet – you’re doing yourself a disservice.  You are an owner in the company and you should be profiting from your own banking!  Try them – you’ll love them and start consolidating all your accounts to them like I am.
8. Post lockup period (ended Monday 6/28) we should see a lot more interest from  ETFs, Mutual Funds, Institutional investors and analysts.   Volume should dissipate and the stock held its ground even with 50M shares trading a day (10X normal volume). There is a ton of demand for not only high growth but also PROFITABLE companies and FinTech specifically.   Based on their market cap and projections for profitability they should be added to the Russell indexes next year and possibly the S&P Indexes if they can meet the profitability criteria etc.

Analyst Price Targets:

Oppenheimer:  Overweight $30 Price Target

Rosenblatt = BUY $25 Price Target

I personally don’t follow Analysts too closely but it does drive institutional investor buying and helps give you a sanity check.

My 2024 Price Target is $42-$50 based on their 2024 projected revenue (with current product offerings, this should increase as they offer new products and finalize the bank acquisition).  This is based on a pretty simple comparison to other FinTech's (Square and Paypal) P/S multiples.  Pretty rudimentary so I'd welcome other input.  

There are obvious risks if multiples come down or if they miss their targets and there is a very high short interest right now but so far they have delivered on all their guidance and growth.

I’ve seen a ton of posts on SoFi trading with a lot of hopes and dreams of a quick hit or WSB pushing it higher and that’s not why I put my money into SoFi over the past few months.  I’m an investor not a gambler...but I have been buying some of the dips when it does on sale.

Disclosure:  I’m long SoFI and it’s my largest holding.  I continue to buy more on dips and plan to add more in general as they meet their targets and goals, release new products.  I clearly have a vested interest in SoFi going higher but I wanted to share some of the research on the company vs. all the hype that's flying out there right now."

6/30/2021 0:00,stocks,"My long as hell, silver DD Sorry this is a bit long winded, but I wanted to put out my entire investment case for silver, maybe just to feel better about having invested most of my life savings into it. I own silver mining stocks, ETF's, and options, but this is the case that ties them together. This is just my opinion. Do you own research, since I’m not qualified or interested in, giving investment advice.

**Supply**

First, it’s important to consider that silver is not like other commodities. It sounds kind of silly, but if we were talking about wheat, oil or pork bellies, the supply and demand would have to match, in the long term and the short term. Gold and silver are mostly valued based on existing stockpiles. They have been mined for thousands of years, and for most of that time, excluding the last 150 or so years, almost everything ever mined was still in some sort of usable form. This is why these metals can act differently than almost other commodities. If the price of corn spiked higher, farmers would switch crops to farm more, and it would eventually correct the price to the cost of production and a reasonable profit margin. Gold or silver could go for a long time being too expensive or too cheap, and it wouldn't immediately correct itself, since the price is based more on the huge stack already mined, rather than just what's going to be mined in the next year. This one frame shift is really key to understanding the current state of the market.

Silver is primarily mined as a byproduct of Copper Lead, Zinc, and Gold mines. This may seem like a random interesting fact, but it actually effects the market a whole lot. If we were talking about lithium instead of silver, and the lithium price went up 5x, every lithium mine in the world will go into overdrive, try to expand production as fast as possible, build any new mines they could, and that will eventually reverse or slow the price increase. If you have a mine that produces 90% of their revenue from lead and zinc, they aren't likely to do the same expansion if the 10% of production that’s silver goes up 5x.

I’ve heard some people talk about the market size of silver as being $1.5T. That's the rough value of all silver ever mined in 3000 years, and is pretty irrelevant in this context. The amount of silver in investible bar form is under 3B oz, which is less than $80B. The Comex has about 110M oz, in registered inventory, and 244M oz in eligible inventory. Eligible inventory is inventory that could be put up for sale if the owners wanted, so it might not be for sale at any given price. The LBMA has 1B oz, but around 85% is already owned by ETF’s. There is lot of silver in the world, but very little for sale in an investment grade, at anywhere near current prices. For a market apparently worth $1.5T, it seems like you could buy every bar in available in the world for about $7B. That’s obviously not counting the existing demand, so it might not take a huge amount of new demand to move this market significantly.

Never forget that every oz of silver in the world is already owned by someone. When people talk about “new” supply coming on the market, that has to be someone who wasn’t willing to sell at the old price but is willing to sell at the new price.

Although there has been much more silver mined through history, silver inventories have been chipped away for decades by industrial consumption, while gold inventories have grown. Don’t forget that although gold has grown, so has the human population, and especially the population those with enough wealth to own gold or silver.

The whole mining industry has been slumping for a very long time. Discoveries of new significant deposits are not only down, but new additions to PM reserves fail to add as many oz as are produced each year. If you consider that it takes years between exploring, drilling, permitting, more drilling, and construction of a new mine, there could be a very big lag between the price going up, and any significant new supply entering the market.

Some people say that if the price goes up any significant amount, a flood of silver will come in from old coins, silverware, jewelry, etc, and correct the problem. In 2011, when silver hit $50/oz, the amount of silver recycled, went up about 50%, from around 100M oz to 150M oz, but that increase was only a small fraction of the mine supply (over 800M oz), so the broader supply demand picture didn’t really change much. There’s still a huge amount of silver in coins, silverware, jewelry, etc, but if it didn’t come back into the market at $50 in 2011, why would it come out of hiding now, for less? Also, although there are still lots of old silver teapots and spoons, they don’t make a lot of new silverware and every year that stockpile shrinks as old spoons get melted down. Much of the silver used in the “silverware” portion of the current demand pie, is used for electroplating, and that silver is never getting recycled.

Over the past several decades, some of the supply demand imbalance in the silver market has come from governments eroding their silver stockpiles. Many countries used to make coinage from silver, so they had to keep stockpiles, both functionally for making more coins, but also as a strategic and central bank asset. Today, the US, Canada, UK, and most other developed countries, have sold the majority of their silver reserves decades ago. The US government had 350M oz in 1970, and around 50M oz from 2006 to today.

&#x200B;

Silver is found in the earths crust at about a 14/1 ratio to gold. Current mine production is about 8/1, and existing stockpiles of investment grade product are not known well enough to compare, but I’ve heard estimates ranging from 3/1 to 1/1. The current price is 68/1. Gold hit it's all time high in 2020, but silver was half it's nominal all time high, or less than a quarter of it's inflation adjusted high.

If you take a more broad view of value over time, gold and silver have historically been valued along the lines of their production and naturally occurring scarcity, from 10/1 to 15/1. This ratio held for thousands of years. If you look at an inflation adjusted chart of silver prices going back many hundreds of years, silver prices were usually many hundreds of dollars. From 1720-1900, the silver price never dipped below $100, and was as high as $500, in todays dollars. For most of the last 3000 years, an average skilled labourers days wage was 0.1 oz of silver.

Lots of people are talking about a shortage of silver, and it’s so much bigger of a deal than most realize. Mints are admitting they can’t source material, and shortages that were once limited to small bars and coins, have spilled over into 1000 oz bars. These days, there are shortages developing in so many things, so it’s seems normal, but this shortage is nothing like the others. As I said at the beginning, if most other shortages are self correcting by the functioning of the markets (planting more corn, etc), but this market is valued based on a stockpile built over 3000 years, then a shortage means we’ve run out of the stockpiles, and the one and only thing that can correct the supply, is higher prices. Given what we saw in 2011, with very little new silver coming back into the market at $50 (or an average though the year in the mid 30’s), it’s safe to conclude that the price it would take to truly balance the market, with no more stack to erode, would have to be dramatically higher than that.

**Demand**

The most important thing to understand about the demand side of the silver equation, is how it’s changed over time. For thousands of years, silver was money. Before the last 150 years, pretty much all the silver ever discovered was still around, and the demand was that it became money the moment it was found. That’s a pretty simple demand case. If you were a prospector in the 1700’s, you could walk into a bar and spend silver or gold you found that day. If you spun some wool, you’d have to trade that for silver or gold before you could spend it.

Then, over time, more and more uses for silver started to appear. This is when silver gained its hybrid, monetary and industrial status, and this status is really key to understanding silver in the world today.

Today, around 60% of silver demand comes from industry, and that demand is quite inelastic. If a company makes smartphones, and the average phone uses $0.35 worth of silver, you don’t stop making phones when the price of silver quadruples, and your phone needs $1.40 worth of silver. Silver is used very broadly, since it’s found in alloys used in most electronics. Because of that broad industrial usage, and the difficulty recovering such small quantities, about 2/3 of the silver consumed is never recovered. If you have a gold watch, someday that watch will break, and the gold will probably end up in a gold bar. If you make a cell phone, one day it will break, and most will end up in a landfill. Even some of the silver that goes through a recycling process still ends up being melted into an alloy so it still isn’t recovered as silver.

Also, industry demand is almost always hard to substitute. Silver is the most conductive element, most reflective element, and has natural anti microbial properties. These properties are elemental and irreplaceable. I’m sure if people could easily use copper instead, they probably already would have. There is a natural trend where a single product, like a solar panel, will use less silver per unit, as manufacturing becomes more and more efficient, but that effect is counteracted by more and more products using silver and higher quantities of production driving that efficiency.

Silver’s industrial demand is highest in fast growing sectors like electric vehicles, solar panels, and electronics. EV’s use significantly more silver that gas cars, and also use lots in their charging infrastructure. The average solar panel uses 0.6 oz of silver, and 5G networks are expected to increase silver demand significantly as they roll out. The trend is clear, the future needs silver, and things that haven’t been invented yet, will probably need the irreplaceable properties only silver can offer.

The other side of silver demand is its monetary or investment demand. At the core of this demand is silver’s historical role as a store of value, as well as the investment case I’ve been spelling out in this and my last post. Silver’s monetary history revolves around it having the key properties of money: durability, portability, divisibility, fungibility, uniformity, limited supply, and acceptability. It’s worth noting that every element on the periodic table that meets these characteristics is already considered money. If you eliminate all gasses, all the elements that are reactive and non durable, all the elements that are too abundant to be portable (lead, iron, etc), the elements that aren’t easily divisible and fungible, so they can’t be divided and reformed, at the end of all that, you are left with only the precious metals. Maybe you can make the case for copper and nickel, but guess what those have been used for.

So, we’ve established that silver is a store of value based on inherent qualities. That makes it a safe haven investment, since people look to stores of value when the future becomes uncertain. For decades now, the world has been lulled into a false sense of security by the US dollar global standard, coinciding with a period of particularly low inflation. A key driver of that period of low inflation, is deflation in prices of consumer goods, because of globalization. Basically, we keep printing more and more money, but China keeps cheaply producing more and more products. This has kept inflation contained in localized asset bubbles (stocks, real estate, art), and most people haven’t seen it effect their lives much (until recently). That could change quickly. The low prices we’ve grown accustomed to, probably won’t keep dropping as we keep printing more money. In short, once China already produces everything, there’s no prices left to bring down to offset the printer.

For years, pretty much every country in the world has been printing money like crazy, and the only thing that makes it not look crazy, is the fact that everyone else is doing it, and currencies are only valued relative to other currencies. People call this the race to debase. Inflation has gone from a non issue in the minds of the world, to the issue of the day, and that’s unlikely to change any time soon.

Much of the developed world has forgotten about gold and silver, with academics referring to it as a barbarous relic, and with the biggest pools of money, hedge funds, pension funds, endowment funds, collectively owning less than 1% of their portfolios in gold, and presumably a fraction of that amount in silver. For individuals, the percentages are probably a bit higher than for funds, but as a share of all wealth in the west, precious metals are a rounding error, even today and even with all the attention we give to the space. It’s just not on most people’s radar yet.

Basically, we have a good case that demand should be higher, but it’s actually pretty low in the grand scheme of things, with most individuals owning none and even the biggest funds not bothering to hold any. Despite this, let’s consider how the market is holding up to this (actually very low) demand.

I can remember a couple times when interest among retail investors spiked up, and premiums on coins and small bars went up dramatically. Every time this happened before 2020, the market would stabilize in months and premiums would fall back down. Producers of small bars and coins got a bigger incentive to make more, so they did, and the market calmed. In 2011, my local dealer would sell me high premium coins, but he could also get me 1000 oz bars at $0.60 over spot.

When covid hit, premiums rose again, but this time they stayed high. The reason is that this time the shortage is across the entire market. My local dealer passes on the prices he pays with a small markup, and his prices have stayed high on coins and bars, but also now his premiums on 1000 oz bars are up to $2.50. Shortages have reached every corner of the market, and there could soon be a time when it simply becomes unavailable.

Scarcity is an incredible driver of behaviour. There are a lot of companies who really rely on silver, and who currently use just in time inventory, so they can’t keep their operations going for long without new inventory. If I recall the toilet paper aisle in March 2020, when people start to sense a shortage, they tend to stock up. Unlike toilet paper, this won’t just be driven by fear and need. This would be driven by fear, need, want and greed. Imagine if toilet paper were a target of huge speculators that could easily and cheaply, house many years of global production, and suppliers couldn’t easily ramp up production, to respond to the shortage. It probably would have left a whole lot more desperate people, willing to pay a whole lot more.

Silver is a market that probably deserves more demand than it’s getting, but in reality has so little demand that the biggest funds and investors barely notice that it exists. Even this tiny demand has been enough to clean out existing stockpiles and create a shortage. The sleeping dragon in this situation is that industrial users need to buy, regardless of price or market conditions. Prices will rise, shortages will grow, and then industrial users will have to compete with a larger and larger group of investors for scarce supply.

**Summary**

This is a small market, with growing and inelastic demand, and an existing supply demand imbalance, that has been eroding available inventories for years. It’s currently in short supply (in an investable, deliverable form), and that shortage is getting worse by the day. The silver market is historically prone to wild spikes, and this time, a large spike up in price would actually be reverting to a more normal historical price (over the very long term), in terms of the ratio with gold, and in absolute inflation adjusted price. The physical price diverging from the paper price may force the Comex and LBMA to make more deliveries than they are basically built for, dry up any available inventory, and may cause a large number of paper contracts to owe physical metal they have no way of obtaining at anywhere near current prices.

Industrial users are the sleeping dragon in this situation, needing hundreds of millions of oz per year to operate their businesses, and historically relying on just in time inventory. Now they are being forced to wait to get inventory, and may start to see a shortage ahead. Some may decide that the risk of not getting product or having to pay much higher prices is too great, so they need to take some of the dwindling inventory for themselves. The more scarce it becomes, the more industry will want to stock up. Speculators will get wind of this, and further compete for the last scraps of bullion.

This situation looks to me like a big bonfire, soaking in the gasoline of paper leverage, that may ignite anytime. I’ll be sitting by with my marshmallows, waiting to sell into a market that might look much different than when I bought."

I still don’t think the shortage in the retail market means anything. The bar and round producers are just playing safe IMO.

I am not saying that it will not be a major player but in way is it worth such a multiple of Carmax, Autonation, Lithia etc..

Firstly, the revenue is not there yet. We just coming off a very hot used car market and shortage in the new car side. Book values are crazy and CARVANA is putting and has been putting to much money in cars. Where are they going to get the inventory to reach the revenue of others?

They have no service or parts like the new car franchises which is a big revenue and profit center. F&I products sales penetration is less with online as well. They have their own financing which i suppose is their big feature like carmax or even better Drivetime. 

The online buying and delivery option can be done by any other franchise. There is nothing unique to it. If you look how lithia motors for example expands their used car inventory in 500mile areas to compete. 

They spend a lot of advertising dollars on Cargurus, [car.com](https://car.com) etc.. With online only what are their conversions like compared to the others that have active sales departments.

We have ""shortages"" everwhere from wood to used cars to real estate.

&#x200B;

My question is, is it really that difficult to bump interest rates up .25% just to help ease the amount of inflation that is happening around the USA? 

&#x200B;

I noticed that other countries are also raising rates already and even India & china have higher interest rates than the USA right now. Why do they insist waiting until 2023-2024?

 One of the first things u studied if you took economics was that 0% interest rates (making money free and printing alot of it) leads to hyperinflation. We are supposed to be able to put our money in the bank and collect at least 2% in interest rates. Why is money so cheap still? None of this is adding up. So I was hoping somebody could explain why interest rates are going to stay at \~ 0% for more years. I am so scared to invest in the stock market now seeing as to how pumped up it is with fake money. Its so obvious that it only goes higher because of 0% interest rates."
6/29/2021 21:19,stocks,"They can't raise rates, too much debt. 1% raise in rates is 300B of interest payments on the national debt. Back in the day the debt was financed with long term fixed rate debt, since 2001 they've been financing with short term, so the national debt is like an adjustable rate mortgage. This is why Volcker was able to raise rates in 1980 and why they can't now. Raising rates will cause complete collapse."
6/30/2021 0:57,stocks,"The Fed holding over night rates between 0 and .25% isn’t causing shortages. It’s a combination of:

* Federal stimulus, enhanced unemployment,

* a lack of options for people to spend money on, 

* companies shifting/canceling orders orders last year only to have demand surge

* Border and trade restrictions that went up as COVID spread

The Fed moving interest rates up .25% isn’t going to do shit to address shortages. Shortages are just going to have to work themselves out through market mechanics of supply and demand. People being able to spend on travel, flights, hotels, concert tickets, hotels, strippers should reduce price pressure on consumer goods and move that pressure to services that are having trouble with staffing.

As for other countries moving their interest rates, it’s mostly developing economies that are trying to balance their currency outflows. They are having to raise rates so their currencies don’t collapse against the dollar, which in technical terms would fuck their economic recoveries. 

While a lot of the stimulus coming from the federal government is leading to increased rates of short term inflation, the Federal Reserve’s support of the bond market will primarily stay within the financial markets and not lead to consumer inflation outside of the housing market."
6/30/2021 9:39,stocks,"Federal Reserve has a dual mandate for maximum employment and consistent inflation near 2% over the long run.
The federal reserve is far from reaching their maximum employment. They discovered that the 3.5% unemployment rate pre-covid was not creating the inflation needed to reach their 2% inflation goal. The federal reserve expects to start raising rates once employment is back to 2019 levels.
From 2009-2019 core CPI was persistently below their inflation target. Core CPI when compared to 2019 is not running significantly above their 2% goal. During this time period people wrongly said there would be hyper inflation from similar money printing and 0%rates.
Current CPI looks high because of the lowered year over year comps when gas was at $1 per gallon last year.
Inflation is transitory because of the low year over year comparisons and temporary shortages. Businesses are going through a bull whip effect of ordering 2x to increase inventory and restock for sales. Once inventory has been restocked and staffing is back to 2019 levels there will be less shortages.
A small increase in interest rates will not eliminate aggregate demand for what is primarily a business restocking shortage."

And it makes sense, whenever you left something to humans uncontrolled it went crazy. Just look at celebrities. Half joke aside, these periods can be weaker, stronger, longer, shorter. The only part that remains true is that the positive and growth parts always outweigh the negative parts. So usually the positive one is kept so long that it almost seems like economy could collapse into a Venezuela 2.0 and then a heavy trigger is pulled. 

The cyclical changes are supposed to disrupt and counteract the asynchron behavior among them. This is really hard for me to explain in English. In short, depending on what the country wants to do you have more extreme times ahead of you later on. And while it seems reasonable to adjust interest rate at any time depending on what happens, it's actually insanely counterproductive. It's like a free ticket for the economy to go as crazy as it can, and when recession hits it reverses heavily into no loaning, no growing, no high expenses. And these cycles allow you to interrupt e.g. price setups from companies and reset pretty much everything on the market that has a life depending on companies (e.g. products based on production and competition value and less on the owns products value will come down hard here)"

For example since this time last year we were seeing very low economic growth we would expect inflation a year on to be slightly above-average. When you combine this with a shortage of available shipping services to get Goods where they need to go and you have an economy that's Prime for a short-term price spike.

In other words the reason the FED has an increased interest rates yet is it doesn't need to, the current inflation figures have more to do with covid than it does with the fed's interest-rate and as such the FED is unlikely to change the interest rate. 

To take this a step further bow I would question whether or not changing interest rates actually has the effect that that claims because the data does not support that raising interest rates decreases inflation or demand for money and instead points toward the exact opposite."

6/30/2021 13:38,stocks,Fed only raises rates when republicans are in office.  So 2024 at the earliest unless inflation goes completely out of control and even then they will likely just lie about it and keep them where they are.

[https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/09/the-pace-of-boomer-retirements-has-accelerated-in-the-past-year/](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/09/the-pace-of-boomer-retirements-has-accelerated-in-the-past-year/)

Baby Boomer retirement is slightly ahead of schedule with \~40% of all individuals of that group already retired. In the coming years, another 40 million people (give or take a couple million) will be retired.

Per this:

[https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/average-net-worth/](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/average-net-worth/)

basically everyone over the age of 55 has an average net worth of $1.2 million and median net worth of \~$250 THOUSAND.

IMHO, the FED needs full employment quickly to ensure economic stability ASAP. It needs full employment (probably with some inflation) in time for the majority of those additional \~40 million to retire so any interest raise will naturally coincide with a need to cool off an expansionary economy. In that way, economic stability is maintained while ensuring (as much as is practible) the recently retired can live on their ""savings"" as long as possible.  


If the FED raises rates now, they risk stifling a post COVID economic recovery, reducing retirement accounts that are probably too low as it is, and result in needing rate reduction at the exact time when retirees need higher interest rates most."
6/30/2021 15:25,stocks,"So, it sounds like you have missed out on gains and want the Fed to tank the market so you can get it. The Fed is not going to raise rates until the data suggests that the inflation is *persistent* rather than transitory. Of course, we are going to see inflation now. The economy has been shutdown partially for the last year. Once you open up and people start spending, inflation will spike. 



If we are still seeing 4-5% inflation in mid 2022, I'm sure the Fed will act, but if we trickle back down to 2% inflation, there is no need. One of the mistakes the Fed made in 2018 was continuing to hike rates with inflation less than 2%."

“Yeah but the stock market is reflective of the economy so they go hand in hand” to which I say is complete bullshit. They absolutely do not go “hand in hand” they’re loosely correlated at best.  Some sectors go down others will go up.

I believe 40% of the money supply was creating from this COVID money printing stuff they did recently. It would be embarrassing to say damnit guys we messed up and now we need to tame inflation. Even Janet Yellen hinted at the fact that they are aware this is ALOT of inflation, and this FED member: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/feds-jim-bullard-sees-first-interest-rate-hike-coming-as-soon-as-2022.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/feds-jim-bullard-sees-first-interest-rate-hike-coming-as-soon-as-2022.html)

There is a great divide within the FED\`s central planning right now. They are just kind of going along with what Jerome Powell says publicly.

c) I saw that states are literally rejecting the extra federal unemployment benefits because its causing people to not want to work and just collect a paycheck. There are a ridiculous amount of jobs right now everywhere. People sort of or kind of just dont want to work right now (I am not sure why for this one).  So the ""unemployment"" is more transitory than the inflation in my opinion.

They will pretend inflation is transitory until they can’t. Just like they pretended subprime was fine until they couldn’t.

Im thinking it’ll happen within 2 years. Anyone who doesnt have a mortgage and has extra cash on the side is going to be rake in the benefits from all the fools taking on massive low interest loans once interest rates start to rise. 

Its simple human nature. Pandemic plus low interest rates makes a lot of people feel like they need to pull the trigger on a house because debt is cheap and that they need to take the high road and live in a detached house rather than crowd up amongst the peasants in multifamily complexes. Once emotion gets involved bubbles start to form and risk aversion goes out the window. Eventually, reality hits and it all comes crashing down."

I would be willing to bet its because alot of their customers just have way more money so they can finally buy that cool Nike special edition sneaker they always wanted. Most nike sneakers are $100+.

I use Nike as an example because it did not have a ""shortage"" those factories in china were actually able to keep up with the ridiculous demand side of the economy. This happens when money is too abundant.

It simply isnt how you run an economy especially the ""biggest and greatest"" economy in the world.  I made this post to see what other people have in mind. 

I also have a real issue with the fact that I cant put my money in a money savings account and collect 2% interest rate (the official inflation narrative is 2% per a year). They are like trying to force me to put all my money into either stocks or real estate, and that is just immoral."

6/30/2021 3:19,stocks,"Yeah,  the FED is just a bunch of humans thinking they know best,  with conscious and subconscious agendas. It's quite amazing how much power they have over screwing up our economy."
6/30/2021 18:21,stocks,"The stock market is a discounter of all widely known information. Anything government officials are saying every day is by definition widely known, therefore already priced into the market. What’s your investment time horizon?"

6/30/2021 6:26,stocks,I agree with u but I think it is closer to 25%
6/30/2021 19:22,stocks,"I think people have to be a bit more fair with the blame. While I agree with what everyone here is saying, we have to understand it’s really our political system that is to blame. When people take office as FED chair or as president or wtv, they serve for a relatively short term. You also inherit the decisions from past presidents, chairman, etc. Do you want to be the one that gets recorded as the one in charge when the economy went to shit? Probably not. It ruins your legacy and probably your life after term. Therefore, the only step to really take is to continue propping shit up. 

Think about democracy and becoming president, you see this play out even more obviously. In order to secure the votes, you have to promise this promise that, all of which requires money. You also cannot cut down on any of the existing programs, otherwise you just don’t get the votes. So then we’re left with a ballooning deficit, no shit things are going to go to shit. It’s really the incentive structure that is fucked. Add on that each presidential term is four years, so the president can’t even really think long term since his next term is not guaranteed. 

Of course, having a leader in power for much longer brings its own set of problems. To be clear, I’m not against democracy or anything."
6/29/2021 23:28,stocks,">With unemployment so high, where will the demand come from to pay the higher prices?

Exactly. Also people seem to forget that millions of boomers retired during covid and millions more will continue to retire. Their generation is the largest in the world and they were the ones fueling this economy with their consumption.

There is not enough people in the younger generations to make up for the coming shortfall of consumption. Once the boomers are on social security they will have a strict budget and won't afford to consume how they did before. This is why I believe prices will be deflationary, not inflationary. There will not be enough spending power to cause widespread inflation."

Was there some manipulation occurring? Sure, maybe. But there was most definitely a shortage. 

Mills were slowing down production even before covid hit. Then lockdowns hit and they shut down even further, and they were hesitant to start back up because if expected lack of demand. Then there was no lack of demand due to stimulus and homeowners being stuck at home (leading to renovation projects). 

It was a perfect storm of issues. There was a shortage. Now there isn't."

So in fact you are running to stay in the same place except now you have invested in companies that could go under because they are overvalued.   Right now there is no safe haven.  Everything is risky and overvalued and keeping money in the bank is not useful either.  Gold and any metals is not acting like the hedge it was supposed to be.   I think the us is going in the way of Japan (stagflation), but with the deficit hanging over us.  We really never recovered from 2008.  We simply reduce interest rates which create businesses that are not viable in a normal interest rate environment.   The banks will keep lending them money like they did in 2008 and that will lead to the next Great Depression as these poorly will take the banks down with them.   If this does not happen then you will see hyperinflation which will have the same effect."

As for pensions I'm just uncertain how the corporations/government will even be able to meet those obligations for the next 20-30 years. With declining consumption leading to declining profits and declining labor force leading to declining tax proceeds I just can't see how they will not cut those benefits at some point in time."

6/30/2021 6:05,stocks,"This is more a matter of personal preference. Most rich people got there through leverage of some sort. One of the most common forms of leverage being loans on real estate. 

For example if you own a $100,000 piece of property and over the course of two years, it goes up 20%, you now have an asset worth 120,000.

But if you own 5x 100,000 pieces of property with a $20,000 down on each and an $80,000 mortgage on each and they all can go up by 20%.  Well now you just turned $100,000 into $200,000 and you got to write off the interest on the $400,000(5x$80k) worth of mortgages on your taxes.  The leveraged money did more work for your bottom line.  This style of investing has worked out for many people.

But there is a certain peace of mind to knowing you don’t owe anybody anything.

I would rather invest my money and make an average of 10% a year while paying the bank 3% a year on the loan. I end up ahead 7% a year on the money over a LONG time frame.  Obviously there are cases where this isn’t true in the short term but there is not a single case in the US so far where investing loses to a 3% loan over a 30 year term"
6/30/2021 10:07,stocks,"Using my personal home as cross collateral is more risk then I want, since the downside/market turn results in potentially being homeless.

However the wife and I do have 2 rental properties already.  Duplex is the greatest entry into real estate we could have asked for back in 2015.  Before Covid we planned on pushing a 3rd rental, but now more liquid assets seems to be the better play.  Wait and see what the economy does.  Too many moving pieces between the money printer, FED stuck with low interest rates, supply chain shortages, snowballing inflation, etc.

Our LLC protects our personal property and investments.  While the leverage from the real estate essentially has us managing over $1 million in assets with a single income household.  It's kind of crazy but that's how leverage and real estate work.  The property itself acts as collateral. 

Real estate makes more millionaires then any other sector by the way."

However, in order to maximize that you have to have cash at the beginning of the crash as well as a steady income source to get through it.  Telling people to leverage now is crazy as the properties and sticks are overvalued."
6/30/2021 7:40,stocks,You don’t make any sense. “Any debt is bad” but suddenly you now have 7 homes that you presumably bought with debt?  Sounds like debt either wasn’t bad for you or you just came from a place of already being rich.

 **AMMO, Inc. Reports Financial Results for its Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year**

**– Annual Adjusted EBITDA of $8.1 million and Adjusted EPS of $0.07 per share –**

**SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., June 29, 2021** — AMMO, Inc. (Nasdaq: POWW, POWWP) (“AMMO” or the “Company”), a premier American ammunition and munition components manufacturer and technology leader, is pleased to announce it has reported financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter and year ending March 31, 2021.

**Financial Summary for Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2021 vs. Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2020**

* Sales for the quarter were $24.2 million – an increase of 409\*\*%\*\*
* Gross Profit Margins increased to approximately 23% – an increase of 179%
* Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 58\*\*%\*\*
* Adjusted EBITDA increased to $4.8 million — an increase of 296%
* Adjusted EPS increased to $0.04 – an increase of 167%

**Financial Summary for Fiscal 2021 vs. Fiscal 2020**

* Sales for the year increased to $62.5 million – an increase of 300%
* Gross Profit Margins increased to approximately 18% — an increase of 173%
* Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 61\*\*%\*\*
* Annual adjusted EBITDA increased to $8.1 million – an increase of 213%
* Adjusted EPS Increased to $0.07 — an increase of 150%

AMMO is positioned for exceptional growth in Fiscal 2022 after establishing a new standard for the Company. Demand fundamentals in the US domestic ammunition market are exceedingly strong and we are seeing no indication of slowing. The Company broke ground on its new state-of-the-art plant, scheduled to be fully operational in approximately one year. And we have established the Company as a cutting-edge design firm, announcing a contract for the design and manufacture of technologically advanced ballistic match ammunition for the US Department of Defense. Our fiscal fourth quarter delivered the best quarterly performance in Company history, with even better quarters reasonably expected to follow throughout Fiscal 2022.

Additionally, the Company experienced sales growth of 46\*\*%\*\* quarter-over-quarter, a $7.6 million increase.

The Company’s margins have also increased to approximately 23% for our fourth fiscal quarter, an increase of 179% or $7.1 million year-over-year. When depreciation and amortization are added back to the cost of goods sold, our gross profit margin increases to 27% for the quarter.

Our operating expenses as a percentage of sales was 25\*\*%**, representing a 58**%\*\* decrease from the prior year quarter. For the year, our operating expense as a percentage of sales was 27%, a 61% decrease from the prior year.

Net Loss for the quarter was approximately $463,000, which includes approximately $3.4 million of non-cash expenses. Net Loss for the year was approximately $7.8 million, which also included $10.1 million in non-cash expenses.

Adjusted EBITDA has grown to $4.8 million for the quarter – 296% increase from the prior year. For the year, our Adjusted EBITDA was $8.1 million – 213% increase from the prior year.

The continuing improvement in adjusted EBITDA and margin shows the impact of the scaling we are beginning to see in our operational costs. We expect our first half fiscal 2022 EBITDA to be better than the second half of fiscal 2021 as a standalone.

AMMO’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased to $0.04 for our fiscal fourth quarter, representing a 167% year-over-year increase. Our adjusted EPS increased to $0.07 for the year, representing a 150% increase from the prior year. Adjusted EPS is a metric the Company values as we believe it is a better representation of the Company’s true operating performance.

The revenue guidance for the 1st quarter of our 2022 Fiscal Year is $41M and will include two months of operations from our newly acquired Gunbroker.com assets. As previously announced, we expect to achieve profitability in this quarter."

They also begin phase 2/3 on a treatment for acute ischemic stroke by end of summer. This stock has solid potential to go much higher in a year or two, though it's a high risk play as all biopharma.


I personally enjoy going into the biopharma stocks because of the high risk, high reward with them. It's a respectable, but not too large, size of my portfolio and I've made some solid returns from some big winners. $DMAC was about 150% gains for me back in February, but even then I knew it has potential to go noticeably higher in the next year or two.

6/30/2021 0:00,stocks,NVDA vs AMD. Which is the better buy for the long term? NVDA is a beast of a stock that has seen a huge run up lately and will be split 4:1 in late July. Many anticipate a spike after the split since it could attract more investors. AMD has also been on a nice run but seems to be the better value of the two with more room to grow. Which of the two would you buy and why?
6/30/2021 1:32,stocks,"If you're holding NVDA already, lucky you. Personally, I would not buy NVDA right now when the stock is *this* hot. If it has a noticeable pullback, I might get in with a few shares in anticipation of the upcoming split, since stocks generally tend to do better after splits.

AMD is also running quite hot right now, and a discount free cash flow valuation shows that it's well above what its intrinsic value should be. If I was looking to buy one of these, I'd wait for a pullback first.

Of course, I'm saying this as someone who's currently holding INTC shares and utterly disappointed by how far this once-dominant CPU giant has fallen."
6/30/2021 0:14,stocks,Why not both?
6/30/2021 1:28,stocks,"AMD simply because Nvidia is so overvalued at the moment. It's hard to justify that valuation. Also, Intel is releasing a dedicated GPU which is more competition for nvidia. 

I'd still pick Intel over those two even if they were all valued at the same ratio. They have the better long term competitive advantage and the market is totally detached from this reality at the moment."

In the AI/ML market, they are pretty much unparalleled.  nVidia's CUDA and their Telsa processors are industry standard, nobody else is even in the market!

nVidia's recent purchase of ARM was a smart move.  A lot of cloud providers are looking at moving off of x86 and to ARM.  Even though the CPU doesn't say ""nVidia"" they'll be paying nVidia royalties.  I expect that to start blowing up, particularly because of the success of apple's M1 chip."

If ARM goes through NVDA will explode. If ARM goes through there is no reason to thinK Xilinx won‘t go through and AMD will increase a good chunk as Xilinx will explode, because 1 xilinx will equal like 1,5 AMD shares diluting the over all share price of AMD while still increasing

Regardless, extremely good company to own for the long term with the whole AI tailwind behind it.

And i have never looked into either stock, but they are both doing very well for different reasons.

AMD CPU performance has been catching up with Intel for years, and last year they really caught up. In some ways AMD has actually surpassed intel, and i expect Intel could be considered the underdog very soon. (before anyone jumps in i realize some already consider them the underdog)

AMD is also neck and neck with Nvidia for GPUs, but unlike Intel i see them as strong competition in the future so i doubt they will end up being the un questioned leader in the GPU market. Plus as the chip shortage ends, and the millions who have been waiting forGPU can buy one we are going to see massive GPU sales for both.

Basically, are my shares considered the same as future offered shares (i.e.- class A common, class B, etc.) My uneducated guess is that the shares are considered the same type of share I currently own. Furthermore, is the Reg-A offering simply a benefit to the company to offer shares under different regulatory purview? I currently do not have deeper information on the tier of Reg-A offering or more information, I simply know that the company has stated intent of a Reg-A offering.

If we have a drop we can't recover from you will have done yourself a favor if you did some doomsday prepping but if it is like every other crash we recover from here are my steps.

Have an emergency fund.  Six months cash helps a family financially weather most storm including enough household provisions you can hunker down for a month and not be forced to buy anything in the event of hyper inflation or another lock down.  

Own quality.  Meme stocks are fun but most meme stocks would struggle in a 2008/2009 market event.  Proctor & Gamble is higher now than october 2007.  General motors did not survive the great recession.  Quality vs. garbage in a down market quality wins out 99 out of 100 times.  
I rode out 2008 and the covid crash fully invested.  If you are timing a market exit you better have a re-entry plan.  The bulk of investing failures who lost 70% and never recovered either owned total garbage investments without proper diversification or they pulled out at a low point and didn't reenter.   If you are down 25% it is probably too late.  

Do not over extend.  100% of foreclosures happen to homes with mortgages.  If Married be able to circle the wagons and survive on one income.  If single be able to survive on half your income. 

We have always recovered.  Just be able to ride the wave.  If we don't recover the prepping route was the way to go.  Just avoid getting swept up in a cash crunch or debt default and you will survive and then thrive in the recovery."

1. Q2 EARNINGS beat EBITDA expectations. Q3 ER includes FabCBD's 70%+ margin, so Q3 will be huge.
2. COMPS. HITI is way undervalued at 2x P/S(!). The Nasdaq listed cannabis stocks competing for institutional capital are overvalued & unprofitable, powered by dilution & delusion. USA comps get no love on the OTC.
3. ACQUISITION targets are in a loaded deal pipeline at all stages of negotiation. Raj negotiated sweet deals on grasscity.com/, smokecartel.com/, fabcbd.com/,  & dailyhighclub.com/
4. FINANCING. Non dilutive commercial bank financing will be secured soon.
5. ETFs (THCX, YOLO, HMUS) now hold positions, and are adding.
6. INSTITUTIONS are quietly building positions before they make their ""BUY"" analysis public. Low float = rapid moves to the upside

0SI.F (not the main ticker, but not allowed to name it because of silly rules) - Currently executing on insane growth. Targeting to exceed current BYND revenue numbers by 2023 while currently at only 1/30th their market cap.

TTCF - Undervalued and stably growing company in a growing market.

FUV - Ton of potential. 2022/2023 will be huge for them if they execute.

UPWK - Simply 100x better than Fiverr and geared towards the enterprise market which will be much bigger than retail. Steady 25% annual growth for years to come as we move towards the freelance economy.

ARKG - Genomics is the biggest opportunity in the market for the next 10-20 years. Stock picking is too risky in this market, so ARKG is the best option.

If you're looking at stocks with low multiples, TTCF is the stock for you. If you're willing to look 1 year ahead, it's 0SI.F."

I own it for the next 5-10 years. So I'd for sure like to hear your thoughts on it. Is there something fundamental I'm missing?  
  
My ""highest conviction"" plays are speculative/secular. You might ask why, and I would say I am hoping for a better return in the 10 year time frame. I do also own some established growth/dividend stocks.  
  
My highest convictions:  
  
(LCID). The idea here being that this company is able to do even half of what TSLA did. From a secular standpoint, EV is strong 2020s, the board of this company is a lot of talent, the funding is excellent, and the technology is in the best of breed and vertically integrated.  
  
RBLX. The idea is the metaverse. Maybe this place becomes an everything hub of online living. The kids using it now will become adults using and paying $ later.  
  
LRCX (Lam Research). I wanted to own chips for the next 10 years, but I think the real $ maker is the people supplying chip makers. Either with materials or technology. Lam makes the technology/machines required.  
  
OUST (Ouster, Lidar company). OUST trades at multiples below all the major lidar companies, yet actually already in the real world, with real revenues that are growing, 500+ customers, making strategic contracts with them, already past several generations of sensor, and wide patent moat.  
  
DT (Dynatrace cyber security....but also....) so I could have gone with Palo Alto or Crowdstrike, but I thought DT offered a different pitch. They specialize in using AI for their Cybersecurity.  
  
My list is probably not your zone, but I'd say these are all below $ 100 billion market cap and have more room to run from secular trends.  
  
If I had to look at my portfolio and give you a recommendation more in line with your investments it would be GOOG. Long term growth will continue, and they own 7.5% of SPACE X. I wanted to own a space stock, so this was a two for one. (This might sound crazy but I have higher conviction in my speculative plays returning more than GOOG)"

In 10 years everyone is going to need a charging station at home of some kind, and public charging infrastructure will be massively needed. 

The combustion engine is seeing its final generation in the mainstream. Every automaker is going electric, many of the rapidly. In 10 years EV’s are going to be really hitting their stride and commanding a majority of the US/European auto market - the two markets where CHPT is already playing.

The market for EV’s doubled over the last year and it’s still a minuscule segment as automakers ramp up. The variety of electric vehicles that customers are waiting for will hit the market fast over the next 2-3 years, the government will hopefully add more incentives to buy, and adoption will accelerate.

6/30/2021 13:25,stocks,"Okay I like this one. It’s hard to choose but here’s my top 5 conviction stocks and an ETF:

1) AMZN - Leader in constant innovation. Dominates cloud, retail and whatever else they decide to do next

2) GOOG - Can you imagine a world without Google search? Top 2 most visited websites in the US are Google and YouTube (aka Google). Leader in data of all kinds which will be crucial to AI

3) NVDA - All about AI here. Once ARM acquisition goes through, I can’t see anyone catching them. Semiconductors as a whole should continue to outperform but especially NVDA

4) NET - Innovative company with a rapidly expanding product portfolio and great leadership. The need for secure, easy-to-develop applications with strong performance at the edge will only continue to grow. High gross margins and revenue growth (especially in large customers) and very sticky infrastructure will make it worth the high PS multiple 

5) FTCH - Leading luxury fashion platform with an ingenious e-concessions model. This gives the brand more control of the product/pricing which luxury brands want, while FTCH provides the platform and takes a sizeable (about 30%) cut. Also, they’re partnered with BABA to expand further in China, as well as with Richemont and Artemis. Strong balance sheet after raising capital from the above partners and their revenue/GMV growth the past few years has been ridiculous

6) ARKG - The applications of genomics technology are almost endless but especially in agriculture and medicine. I think AI and genomics (which are related as it is) will be 2 of the defining technologies of the next few decades. Maybe energy/energy storage as well"

Another big one would be Salesforce. Big time expensive, but big time powerful. Integrates well with other systems. And customer service / support, alongside automations and self help, are becoming more and more important as customer volume increases."
6/30/2021 4:52,stocks,"I agree that Workday has the superior products, but I doubt they'll be able to disrupt SAP or Oracle.

There's a reason these companies are insanely profitable, whereas Workday isn't: their customers are huge and have been customers for a very long time. In these cases, switching CPM or ERP systems, for instance, isn't a call made by IT or the department heads who will be using the software, but by the C-level excecs. For them, it's a strategic decision and SAP and Oracle have been around forever and replacing them would be a huge hassle. Also, they have such huge margins, they can and will easily undercut competitors like Workday with massive discounts (50-80%).

I hate to burst your bubble, but purely from an investment perspective, I'd rather bet on SAP and Oracle.

Disclaimer: I have been working in the B2B/SaaS software industry for 10 years."

Too many companies means when one really takes off, the others hold the etf back. Plus, only rebalancing monthly means a lot of stuff gets missed out on. 

WSB will hype a stock for a week and then little of it may be mentioned afterwards"
6/30/2021 12:24,stocks,Very true and definitely a good reason why I just don’t see them losing. It just sounded like OP wanted a sexier and more exciting answer other than Microsoft lol but I’m riding them till the end!
6/30/2021 17:29,stocks,"MSFT was my first thought after reading the thread title. Can't go wrong with Microsoft or Apple, tbh. Visa and MasterCard, too. The vast majority of transactions around the world are still done in cash, so the room for growth for both companies is HUGE."
6/30/2021 17:31,stocks,"They may be good plays, but none of them will ever be as influential to human civilization like Microsoft, Apple, Google, or even companies like Visa.

Their system is less flexible than CRISPR/cas and it’s not really clear to me that it can be successfully targeted to a wide variety of genome locations. I think it’s more limited tech and that crispr and cas proteins are going to get to the easiest to cure diseases before DTIL and meganucleases do.

6/30/2021 2:55,stocks,Seems like a great company based on their margins and ROE. I’ve been on the fence about  buying them but their valuation is a tad high relative to their growth. I guess paying for that kind of dependability makes sense though.
6/30/2021 7:53,stocks,"Ive considered V based on the ROE and ROIC, but they’re expensive. You can get dramatically better ROE & ROIC at a similar PE with companies like AAPL or MSFT. 

I think it comes down to what you see for the future of the company, and I’m not well positioned to forecast what payments will look like in 10 years, or if one of the many disruptions we’re seeing now will ever actually make waves big enough to affect a behemoth like V. But if you feel comfortable that they’ll continue to grow 30% YOY, you’d kind of have to be crazy not to have a big position, right?"
6/30/2021 3:20,stocks,"V could be disrupted. Their main advantage is their payment network - with ongoing digitization their dominance could be disrupted by alternative payment solutions of the next decade. (Wallets, stable coin solutions etc)"

6/29/2021 22:22,stocks,"This is where it gets confusing but also exciting. 

1. Yes. If you buy PSTH you will own UMG @ 14.75 day one of IPO. UMG will be originally listed on Euronext Amsterdam Exchange so check with your broker to see if they support this but in all likely hood they will uplist on NYSE shortly after IPO. 

2. You will also own PSTHr (AKA Remainco) at ~5.25. PSTHr will continue to search for a company to merge with. This will have funds of 1.5 billion with an additional 1.5 available. Essentially, You can get two companies for one SPAC. 

3. But here’s the kicker, you will also be allowed to purchase SPARC. Without having to put any money down, Bill Ackman will go out and seek a third merger within 5 years. If/when he does, you can buy in at NAV after he announces. You will not have to have your money sitting in a SPAC without knowing who, what, or when a deal will be announced. You simply continue on with your life and your investing and wait for him to announce and decide at that time if you want to buy at NAV."
6/29/2021 22:53,stocks,PSTH is getting direct access to shares to UMG with much better tax consequences than VIVHY though which makes it much more popular. Also UMG works extensively with the artists and live nation on shows so they are in that business but more as a supporter.

In vr they're already industry leader, and 1/5th of the company now works in vr. They won't be caught in the space, and it gonna be huge. Apps, games, p*rn, live events, industry training, social clubs, esports, military training etc. Facebook takes a cut of it all.

Facebook is going to own all the hardware, all the apps, and all the network. Whole online space where Google, Amazon, and Apple aren't allowed. And if not, then I just bought a social media company at a fair price in this market."

6/30/2021 5:07,stocks,"I won't argue that they're growing rapidly. I'm arguing the following:

1) Workday isn't profitable. Anyone can grow while losing money. The big question is if they can turn it around eventually.

2) Even after their recent growth, their revenue sits at $4.3b. It will take an eternity for them to come anywhere close to SAP's $32b or Oracle's $40b (especially if they continue to burn money).

3) You have to consider the global perspective as well. In Europe, for instance, Workday still has a tiny footprint and it remains to be seen if they can establish themselves. Meanwhile, SAP is a huge force in Europe and Oracle isn't exactly small either.

I'm not saying it can't be done. Anything is possible. The question is: Is it probable? Based on the facts, I'd say no, it's not probable. If you go one step further and take company valuations into consideration, there's even less of an argument to invest in Workday. Literally everything needs to go their way for the next 10 years to even come close to the returns you'll see on an SAP/Oracle investment (both of which are relatively fairly valued atm)."

6/29/2021 22:45,stocks,"""They aren't going anywhere"". Big disagree. They aren't going completely away, even myspace is around today, but I don't think they have a future 10 years from now with a strong valuation. Facebook did a lot of things right that Myspace didn't. However, FB made a lot of the same mistakes that Myspace did. Ads, clutter, and other revenue stream activities. Great for the stock, on the short term, but plenty of things that the users themselves dislike. 

In January this year, a report came out noting that daily active users in the US has stalled. I've also noticed a trend personally with people not using it. Back in 2010, I had a campus life university job. I had countless new freshmen talking about how they only use FB for keeping in touch with their parents/grand parents, and that Instagram was what was cool. I have friends who are teachers (K-12) and that trend is even more prevalent today, except even IG use is declining (which is bad for FB as well since they own it). 

Privacy concerns, ads, complexity, and user experience are all reasons that younger generations are not on board with it. It's more cumbersome to share thoughts or videos compared to TikTok (which I hate). Photo posting, organization, and viewing just feels antiquated. And I think it will take company doing what Facebook did: creating a more trendy, user friendly, clean, and youth-focused platform to accelerate an exodus. And as people start leaving it, so will the parents and grand parents that have it to stay in touch."

6/30/2021 5:53,stocks,"Workday is undervalued when compared to the valuations that Oracle and SAP had while dominant. Oracle and SAP are overvalued because their customer base is shrinking. 

Also, your arguments were missing a few pieces:

1. Workday would be very profitable if they didn’t spend $2B a year on R&D. Either way they’ve got $3.5B in cash and less than $1B in debt. So I’m not worried about profitability at the moment. I like that they’re aggressively chasing growth

2. They’re still relatively new. I’ve seen their sales and distribution channels first hand, and know for a fact that they are selling like crazy. What you’re saying is that there is at least $72B of revenue to steal from the legacy platforms with significantly inferior products

3. I will concede this point. SAP definitely dominates Europe and Workday is more focused on North America at this point. But global expansion can always come later

All in all, Workday has a track record of explosive growth and a target market ripe for the taking. It’s only a matter of time.

6/29/2021 23:19,stocks,"Google tried to take market share at the height of Facebook growth, long before data sharing and privacy concerns and public hearings. They tried to take market share with a platform that they marketed horribly and was clunky to use (I was a very early user and I work in user experience for a career). And they didn't invest well into it after launch. 

Facebook had natural growth during a time that MySpace was becoming undesirable. It feels like Google walked in expecting to strong arm users based on their name and reputation alone. 

Although, you're right. I say ""All that has to happen"" as if it's easy for a company to create something that's a winner. But look at and consider something.

Many social media platforms have come and gone. Some that were quite large. And a major reason for switching is ease of use and privacy. FB is becoming increasingly bloated. They are beholden to their shareholders. Optimizing revenue streams is a higher priority, a fiduciary duty, than customer satisfaction. CS plays a part, but they've proven that given the choice between another ad section (or sponsored content) and a better user experience, they are picking the ad section. 

A new company/platform is not beholden to the same duties. They can design as they want and create a more idea user experience. It would obviously take a few years of development + marketing + adoption + natural growth, but it's not impossible. It's happened before."

The act of selling something entails conveying ownership, you shouldn’t be able to convey ownership of something you don’t own, that makes it a fictitious supply.  The proof is in the next part of the supply/demand definition, it that neither party should be acting with a “compulsion”. When you are forced to buy something because you sold another that was not rightfully in your ownership, you create a compulsion to buy, at whatever price regardless of how fair the value, that is why squeezes result in sky high prices. If AMC did not print another 11m shares, it’s price would have sky-rocketed even further, because of the “compulsion”.  Short selling breaks the system, plain and simple.

Riding off what the gentleman shared above, I would like to share my opinion on the *when* to buy in. 


The stock, as seen in the daily chart [over here](https://imgur.com/RbgmdOk)  has been ranging for a while. Mostly I would say because of profit taking and seemingly reaccumulation of positions.





This means, whoever has been reaccumulating here has a strong position to send the stock to another rally. This is also seen by how it seems ready to move as it retests last point of support (see **lps** on the chart) would be the last test it needed before taking off. 






**Full Disclosure**; I have [a few shares](https://imgur.com/KrheSmb) in the company already and now waiting for my the market to react.  







**Other Similar Examples;**


A recent example of such a range and break out can be found on the [$NVDA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9mutj/nvda_play_100_based_on_ta/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share))  post I shared. Entry was also on breakout but I've also recently got into [$ATOS ](https://imgur.com/UCR8oTH) with a few shares [at retest ](https://imgur.com/YhMaAzY) of the break out and $INTC [based on](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwingTradingTA/comments/o746pc/intc_reaccumulation_range_i_notice_a_lot_of_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) the price action analysis of the trading range. 

Others are $AAPL and $AMZN that seem ready to break. 





TL;DR - $HIMX about to breakout and a possible rally may ensue.

6/29/2021 21:59,stocks,Depends on how much debt you are in and your lifestyle and expenses
6/29/2021 22:48,stocks,What age are you retiring.
6/30/2021 0:48,stocks,"Bro, $500k is not a goal. 20% of $500k is only 100k a year and I wouldn’t call that living your best life. If you’re 65, I’m sorry. But if you’re 23 - be patient. Plus consider inflation and the obvious point made here already that 20% is aggressive. 

My retirement goal is $10M. That’s broad and considers real estate, inheritance and many other factors. Its a goal and I may never reach it. It’s also not a reflection of just wanting to jump into retirement or switching day jobs to being a day trader either. It sounds like your goal is more about moving from your day job to spending your days trading stocks. To be specific, I love my job and it prints money + I don’t work that hard. So I like what I do. I enjoy it. I get a sense that you don’t like what you do but prefer to day trade. 

If that’s the case, look at it that way. Don’t look at it like retirement because it isn’t. Consider all of your factors like real retirement. You won’t be able to live off $100k in 30 yrs like you can today. My advice, find a job you love, invest and save. If you really just want to trade all day, you need to grow your wealth in addition to funding your lifestyle while accounting for future unplanned expenses."

I think the more money you have the more you could potentially risk and still be okay. If Buffet gets a 50% drawdown, it’s not going to affect him one bit. If you only have 500k and it drops to 250k, the climb back up is going to be real hard."

Where is your money invested now?  Traditional IRA?  Roth IRA?  401K?  Unless you’re in a Roth, you’re gonna lose 20% right off the bat.

Either get multiple income sources before thinking about retiring, or put your $500k into dividends where you could get $35k the first year and $39k the second year and so on so forth if you choose to reinvest dividends for a few years.

6/30/2021 14:26,stocks,"I think 20% year over year is unrealistic.

Too many people got into trading over the last couple years (after last year's crash) and think the money they make now (made.over the last 18 months) trading is sustainable. It's not. If you could make 20% every year, hell yeah you could retire and live on the 100k a year. I just don't think that's realistic.

I think the key to retiring (retiring early) is as you mentioned...annual income. As opposed to lump sum savings. And I think diversification is key to that. More to the point is...to have part of that income being a relatively guaranteed recurring income.  Think - a retirement plan from working, social security, passive income from real estate, CDs, bonds, etc.  

It would be nice to be able to maintain a 20% a year profit on investments in the market, but what happens the year that is 0? Or negative 20%?  Let's say you could live on 60,000 a year in retirement, it would be nice to have at least half of that guaranteed, and the prospect of making more than that in a good year, so you could build your nest egg, build your monthly income during good years, to make up for bad years."
6/30/2021 15:13,stocks,"10% annually is more realistic return.

It's not that you can't make more it's that you'll risk a lot more to do so.

If it's just passive income you need to pump the brakes on expected returns. Which will involve hedging, stability and definitely no yolos.

On the other hand you could probably survive on 10% of 500k anyway and still save money, just depends on how you want to live."

6/29/2021 21:03,stocks,Madoff offered 10% and people thought that was sketchy as fuck. And we saw how that played out
6/29/2021 20:21,stocks,"That’s not even math. If you buy 5 stocks and each gain 4-5%, then you made 4-5% overall.

If you’re saying 4-5 TRADES per month that’s 20%

6/29/2021 22:29,stocks,Is nobody gonna point out that if you have 5 stocks and they each do 4%-5% then your average return is 5%?
6/29/2021 22:58,stocks,There are no taxes on the first 80K in capital gains
6/29/2021 21:59,stocks,That

6/30/2021 11:59,stocks,"I think they did, assuming their annual return used for modeling is 5%. All you have to do is use an inflation-adjusted return. 

So if you think that the market will give you 8% in nominal return, and inflation will be 2%, 5% is your inflation-adjusted return. 

The S&P500 has had an inflation adjusted average return of about 7%, although it’s done better recent decades"

6/30/2021 18:40,stocks,Yea I thought I had replied to that other comment about that. I just updated my spreadsheet today actually and used 7% return and 3% inflation to get ~3.88% real return and just rounded that to a 4% real rate of return.

6/29/2021 20:34,stocks,Yeah... Hindsight is 20/20 for investments. 20% is not easy at all or most people wouldn't be working.

6/30/2021 5:08,stocks,America [taxes long term gains](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp) at 0% if you're in the lowest income bracket based on your filing status.

6/30/2021 11:58,stocks,"Agreed. You have to have room not to panic but your on the right track. I sell Covered Calls on the majority of my long positions. I use major market dips like we had in 2018,2019,2020 to buy stocks that are cheap relative to themselves and sell Covered Calls against them.

SP500 is just the 500 of the biggest companies listed in the USA by market cap. There *are* obvious underperformers. 

The next few years will likely be good for travel, leisure, and consumer spending. It will probably continue to be bad for traditional retail and malls. I suspect non-delivery, non-premium dining (think Olive Garden) will continue to struggle with rising prices and rising wages"

I’ve got assigned on quite a few but I’m good with that. New opportunity every day. Most people talk about the company they invest in but I’m here strictly to make money. I do Fundamental analysis before any long positions to make sure it’s cheap to itself on a relative basis but that’s it. 100% of my buys are trades I’m not holding anything for a year.
6/29/2021 20:22,stocks,Right? I don’t understand at all… I mean 2022 can be a whole bear market and I can lose 50% of my portfolio and still wouldn’t scratch the surface with how much money I already had made…

6/29/2021 20:13,stocks,"True, regardless swing trading meme stocks during a bull market and expecting the same returns “year after year” is a flawed strategy."
6/29/2021 23:14,stocks,I’ve been offered before! But why would I take a funds money and turn around and make them money for a percentage of that? Why would I not just take my own money and keep all my profits or keep it in rotation? I’m very shocked at the amount of people that don’t think this is possible or can’t be normalized….
6/29/2021 20:14,stocks,Trading meme stocks is not my strategy…. But if you can sit there and say it doesn’t produce great returns then you’re wrong. Like I said before I’ve only dabbled with meme stocks for the past 6 months…. Other than that it’s always been open game!
6/29/2021 23:17,stocks,"Umm because you could invest your own money along with the fund and make returns on your cash as well as collect the percentage.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say you're full of shit."
6/30/2021 6:28,stocks,"Keeping a small percentage of a large amount of money could be more than 100% of a smaller amount of money.

Which fund offered to hire you, by the way?"
6/29/2021 23:29,stocks,I’m really not if I can attach photos in a message I would happily send you a job offer from my Atlanta based fund. I sat through two days of orientation and decided it wasn’t for me. There comes a greater sense of anxiety dealing with other peoples money.

6/30/2021 0:00,stocks,"According to Buffett, it is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than an average company for cheap.   He never really explained why, as far as I know. From the data I’ve seen, buying companies on the cheap is an outperforming strategy.  Break this down for me. Why or why is it not better? It can’t be solely due to the difference in tax rates."
6/29/2021 23:52,stocks,"Lots of good answers. To me Buffett was trailing closely on his mentor Ben Graham's footsteps, and a bit too closely, when he started out. He was trying to buy a company for  $5 a share that had assets worth $10 a share and then wait, say, a decade for the rest of the market to catch up and realize the true value of his asset. Later on, with more of the  influence of Munger, he came to understand that it'd be better to be $13 for a company with $10 in assets, but that was growing profits at 10% per year every year and also increasing its stock price by 10% per year. By Graham's standards, the latter is overpriced because you're paying a premium over net asset value. But as Buffett would later learn, it is more profitable to take the latter case."
6/30/2021 3:14,stocks,"A good company you never have to sell and all of your gains are compounded. 

The average company you have to sell if the stock price catches up."

Because great companies figure it out and deliver all the time
Bad companies miss! Stay away from losers or you may get burned"
6/30/2021 2:29,stocks,"From what i can tell, there are two main reasons. 

One, the need to constantly search for new companies. Company A: Average company trading at 50% discount, grows 3% a year. Company B: Fairly Valued but grows at 15% a year. Whereas simply holding onto a company B will suffice to generate returns over 10 years or more, one needs to constantly search for undervalued company As, which may or may not exist. 

Two, the impact of taxation on compounding. I'm too lazy to do the exact math, but suffice to say, making 20% per year by finding an undervalued stock then selling it, having say 40% taxed results in much lower returns than the same 20% returns compounded over 20 years and paying that 40% at the end."
6/30/2021 5:49,stocks,"Buffet himself loved buying cheap companies.  Buying at a discount too nook value for example.

In general low p e stocks are cheap.  They have a low pe bc they have problems in their business or arent fashionable.

The opposite is high p e stock who have high growth expectations built into them.  The minute the growth slows they tank.

Buying stocks with a reasonable p e vs the market is what buffet means"

6/29/2021 23:27,stocks,Buffett’s annual growth was double the rate he got in the 80s with Munger’s strategy.
6/30/2021 9:19,stocks,"The point I was trying to make, not as clearly as I would have liked, is that there are 2 components of the return: (1) the investment return, which is represented by the rate at which earnings compound over time; and (2) the speculative return, which is represented by the change in P/E between the purchase and the sale.  In the short term, the speculative return dominates but in the longer term what matters most is the rate at which the earnings compound.  If you wait long enough, the role of the speculative return becomes trivial.  

What I believe Buffet was saying was that, if you plan to hold stocks for the long term, the thing you should worry about most is the rate at which earnings compound, which in turn depends on the quality of the company, its business model, its moat, etc."

Not even the news of partnering with Amazon made any difference. It created a new low for the week and seems like it’s heavily shorted (not retail selling). Short interest is at 23 million with an average volume of 8.5 million. Seems like a good setup for a run starting now. Personally, didn’t see any news that is alarming for the stock to drop a few percent over the last two days. Cruise line may be delayed, but that’s less than 4% of their profits, so not a big deal compared to selling out all their theme park tickets, getting bigger view ship for Disney+. Anyone have a good guess as to why this is down and whether it’ll bounce back this week? I don’t believe it has anything to do with the Delta variant, but anyone will say it does just to make the bearish story make sense."

This is just the news I found reported."
6/30/2021 1:11,stocks,Your only argument is the price. Yeah of course there are other stocks who are even higher valued. Still Disney at this level will probably not perform better than the market. So I think there are lots of better options atm.

6/29/2021 20:03,stocks,"That's a pretty silly way to look at it. Someone says it's expensive so you respond with other people buy more expensive things and prices go up.

I like Disney just fine and I'm willing to buy but your reasoning needs work.

The reason I need Disney to drop more is because I have other things I want money into so Disney needs to sell for a great price for me to care. A fair price is only important if it's a core holding of mine. Disney isn't core for me. It's just a stock I belive in that I'll buy if it's at a really good price. It's too expensive for something that I'm not buying monthly."

6/29/2021 20:13,stocks,"tl;dr - get a crystal ball to time it perfectly, or do your thing and stop worrying. People who bought at the Feb 2020 peak and held are by and large still in very good shape today.

In response to a once-a-century pandemic, the markets crashed by 30%. So let's assume this mythical crash will tank the markets between 15 and 20 percent. Which is still an awful lot.

On March 17, the S&P hit a local peak at 3983. It came this close to breaking the 4K barrier before getting sent back down and waiting another couple weeks to break through. Someone who cashed out of their position at the absolute peak that day for fear of ""The Crash"" has already missed out on a 7.7% increase.

If today's peak of 4300.52 was the absolute top before this scary, mythical crash of 20% kicks in, the S&P goes back to 3440. That means this 20% crash is only going to be down 13.6% from March 17.

What if the crash is only 15%? That means it will bottom out only 8.2% below the March 17 local peak.

Next scenario: Imagine this crash kicks in at the end of the year instead of this very instant. And in the meantime, instead of growing 7.7% in three months, let's assume half the growth in twice the time. 3.9%, from today's level, for the rest of the year.

That has the S&P topping out at 4467. Now, from that point, if the market crashes by

* 15%: it drops to 3797.545, or only a 4.6% drop from the March 17th level
* 20% (which, again, is severe and only likely to occur in response to yet another major, generation-defining crisis): it drops to 3573.6, or a 10.3% drop from a *perfectly timed* March 17th exit.

If the crash happens next year, or five years after that, it's almost certain that it bottoms out above March levels. And if you have stayed in the whole time, your awareness of what's driving the markets is that much higher, and it makes you better positioned to capitalize on the recovery and actually accelerate your gains, like what we saw w/ COVID."
6/29/2021 20:32,stocks,Nothing. DCAing as usual. If 20% or more drop I’ll take cash outta savings to dump in.
6/29/2021 21:15,stocks,"For the most part holding most of what I have and riding it out if it goes down.  Saving all the cash I can now to put into stocks when it goes down and take advantage of the upswing that I missed out on with the covid crash.  


Or maybe just might sell my 15 little shares of a stock I happen to like if it goes to like 10 million a share and quit my job too.  Donate enough of the proceeds to st jude children's hospital to cover taxes, reinvest half the remaining in rock bottom priced stocks while the whole market is on its head and not care what it does cause i'll still have enough to comfortable live out my life.  


Could go either way."
6/29/2021 23:11,stocks,"I think it’s coming in the next 12+ months.  I’m not 100% certain though.  The market could fall 30%, or hyperinflation might stall that, but still crush the lower classes.

The fed might raise rates while the housing boom is still going.  That should bring stocks down more slowly, leaving less distance to fall.  An increase in minimum wage would also shake things up, and help inject more money into the economy, at the expense of a few weaker companies falling sooner.  Again, might give less distance to fall, but also pushing the fall further out, maybe end of next year.

For now, holding tight, and looking for when the housing market starts to cool off.  I’m highly diversified, and have increased my safety fund size.  All debts other than mortgage are paid off.  Mortgage is refinanced to a lower rate.  I’m trying to get caught up on deferred maintenance for the house.  

If I keep my job through the crash, I’ll keep contributing to diversified funds.  If I lose it, I will hope for a lower paying job to stretch my safety fund, and may have to suspend contributions.  That might be a good time to do a roth conversion."
6/29/2021 23:16,stocks,"Who knows if the market will crash.  But I am sitting on more cash than usual right now.  I also bought some US I-bonds via [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/) .  Their interest rate is based directly on the CPI-U inflation metric, and so they roughly keep up with inflation.  Right now the interest rate is 3.54% - not bad for an instrument that has nearly 0 risk!  You can only buy $10k per year (or $15k if you are willing to go through some hassle with tax returns and paper bonds).  Also, you have to wait at least 1 year to redeem the bond.  So maybe not the best move if you're convinced the market will crash and rebound in the next year."

Now there's concern about commercial mortgage backed securities.   I believe that's because of all the businesses that couldn't pay rent during the pandemic.

6/30/2021 6:11,stocks,"You're new to investing so the thing you need to understand is that your bias will cause you to a) not listen to what I have to say and b) lead you to believe you can do what a very small percentage of people do maybe once in their lifetime. 

You can't time the market. No one can. You may get it once, it may be a nice little windfall, but it would be far better to not try to time the market, in general. You might think you can time a crash, and yes, there are a variety of business cycle indicators you might use, like inverted bond yield, or high yield spread. But you'll never get exactly correct enough where you'd earn MORE than if you had just not tried timing the market and built a diversified portfolio that balances risk and safety. 

People who do this for a living, who went to the best schools, work in the best funds, have more information and tools than you'll ever have, can't time the market. It's the biggest amateur, rookie mistake to think you can, and it's really funny to watch new investors attempt to do so. 

You've probably made a nice return since the crash, and I'm guessing it's your first time investing. This is your massive disadvantage. You're, in many ways, fucked for the rest of your investing career. Because your bias will lead you to believe that you're good at investing, which you aren't, you just bought when everything was at a discount, and you'll assume that all times will be like this period. You basically fell ass backwards into what was a win win situation... in other words, unless you went for really stupid equity, you couldn't lose. 

The track record for winning in a given year, i.e., beating the market, is 50%. That includes the best investors in the world. You won't beat them, guaranteed, over the long term. Maybe you'll get a year in there, maybe. 

Harvest some of your wins, allocate a good portion to bonds, like standard investing advice, don't seek timing advice on Reddit, lol, and invest responsibly.

A correction is likely coming up very soon in the next month or so but those aren’t worth the effort to do anything drastic. Just keep a little cash ready to buy. Now protecting against a crash is another story.

If protecting against a small to moderate crash, transitioning away from growth stocks to safer assets like dividend stocks is a way to go just to minimize losses before transitioning back to growth stocks. 

Protecting against a major crash which could take years to recover from might warrant liquidation or holding off on further investments to build a big pile of cash to invest in the market upon the crash. This is very tough to do though and I can’t say I’ll likely ever do this myself. Best I’ll ever do is anticipate corrections while keeping cash ready to buy or anticipate a small to moderate crash and rebalance a little bit to dividend stocks."

The question that got me to do that was “would I borrow money at 4.5% interest to invest in the market in its current state?”. The answer for me is no. Other people will have different risk tolerance and answers. Still holding all my stocks and don’t plan on dumping or anything crazy like that, but I think the most likely path from here is choppy… I prefer a high risk free rate if you can get it over the current market conditions."

I’m not going to sell shares if the market craps (AMC I’m looking at you), I freed up enough cash to pay my taxes at the end of the year.

BTW, I’d just buy more shares at the dip and sell my children to cover taxes so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
6/29/2021 21:43,stocks,"So I think odds are likely we experience a major correction soon. I'm a pretty high risk day trader (not really day but short term), more suited to r/wallstreetbets than r/investing or r/stocks.

I regularly put a very small portion of my portfolio into very far OTM calls on UVXY.

Logic here is it's very cheap, and when markets crash, they crash fast. UVXY is a leveraged volatility fund. Options give me extra leverage.

I spend a few hundred a month on calls around 2-6 weeks out.

I look at it as an insurance policy.

Every month there's not a crash, I lose a few hundred or thousand.

When there is a crash, I may lose a lot on my stock holdings, but the insurence policy of far OTM UVXY calls will payout potentially over 100X that months premiums (assuming no counter party risk for the derivatives contracts in the fund or if there is a counter party failure I end up the end recipient of a govt/fed bailout)"

6/29/2021 21:50,stocks,"I have about 75% of my portfolio allocated to stocks, mostly the low P/E stocks, and the other 25% in cash, for a buying opportunity.

My strategy is pretty simple -- don't go all in on any one thing, and don't go all in at any one time. Been buying steadily and gradually across a variety of sectors and will keep doing so on down days, up days, flat days, and intend to hold most of my portfolio long-term.

On the rare 'gambles' I set automatic points to sell and take my profit, or sell and stop my loss.

Markets will go up, markets will go down. As long as you don't blow your whole load on one thing and/or at one moment, and you make sure you can afford to have your $ parked medium / long term and aren't forced to liquidate at any one given time, then you'll be fine.

If for some reason the markets are *not* fine long term -- perpetual bear market, multi-market collapse, hyperinflation or economic failure -- then you have bigger problems to worry about than your portfolio performance."

Honestly, stay away from what I call baby jesus stocks. P/S metric in the 30s is not very hard to find and just an absolute horror of a valuation. I believe the best place to be is in stocks with great long term businesses with a P/S of around 1. Heck even JNJ trades for 5x sales and thats high but its nothing compared with others out there. The conservatively priced businesses may lose 50% while the guys holding stocks priced like they walk on water will lose 80-99%. The dollar might not be safe. Gold may be a nice place.

- Right now we are seeing the inflation caused by the crazy amounts of money that was printed in 2020. In essence the prices of everything is going way up.
- The housing bubble. People are buying property like crazy. My house is worth double what I paid for it rn. 
- Gas prices. When gas prices go up it drives the prices of everything up.
- Lumber prices have quadrupled, this is inflating the housing bubble even further
- Computer chip shortage. Due to ports being closed or understaffed all of 2020 we are running out of computer chips. This drives up the price of anything computer related, notably automobiles.
- The economy is already stretched to its limits from Covid shut downs last year.


At what point will people just run out of the money to purchase overpriced goods? I see a lot of borrowing happening right now and that's only going to sustain us for so long until the bills are left unpaid. That will be when we see the businesses fail and layoffs begin. Is a collapse going to happen? Probably. It looks a lot like 2007 to me, minus the carefree lending. However if supply lines come back with a flood of oil and goods and lumber, we might see prices drop enough to sustain the economy."

I started keeping about 10-20% cash just in case, and sure enough everything keeps going up. It’s not really worth timing the market. The money feels wasted not earning anything just sitting there and then you think about inflation and it feels like it’s just getting diluted everyday. Selling covered calls and cash secured  puts is what I have been doing. That way I can make some extra money and if it happens to time with a drop in the market I can pick up shares at a discount.

6/30/2021 0:49,stocks,"Yes, I think there will be a correction -- not a crash -- in the near future, and I'm preparing in two ways:

\- Holding steady. Most of my portfolio is based on strong fundamentals, so if anything takes a big hit, I'm confident I can just ride the wave.

\- Keeping a healthy savings account. Two reasons for this: If things get rough, I've made sure -- as sure as anyone reasonably can be -- that I don't have to liquidate any of my portfolio to take care of myself; then, if I'm doing okay, maybe I can average down on my favorite picks during the dip.

I don't have any stop losses set because, like the flash crash of 2010, any unpredictable, large-volume move could cause a cascade of quasi-automated volatility that snowballs over the market. (I'd hate to lose a bunch of money on a glorified glitch that corrects itself by the end of the week.) But that's just me, I'm pretty passive."

(Yes, I know it's better to just invest in index funds. I picked stocks fully aware that I can't beat the market and each individual company whose stock I hold has a chance to go belly up in the event of a crash.)"

6/30/2021 1:36,stocks,"I think it's coming by the end of summer. I moved out onto 10 acres with my wife and bought cattle and chickens. We've also bought a ton of non-perishables and a generator. I got the fuck out, so did she. She completely emptied her 403c in early June. Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like we're at the top of it all and it's about to come down."

6/30/2021 1:51,stocks,"Well, I don't really know if I expect a crash or not, but thr VIX is not bad to have in a crash, and I suspect metals should do pretty well if the market tanks as well.  Beyond that just set some stop losses or look for healthy exit points from your positions."

This will start happening in 6-9 months.  This is one factor that will contribute to a market crash.  How severe, we don’t know yet."
6/30/2021 2:00,stocks,I think it could happen since our financial systems can be fragile when it comes down to it. A new virus development could cause a more lingering dip.

I personally am keeping a healthy amount of stocks in slow moving stocks that will not budge as much during a crash so I can utilize margin."
6/30/2021 2:48,stocks,Setting stop losses will fuck you unless you have leveraged positions you literally cant let go down too far. If it crashes your stop losses will trigger and then it will go back up (the next day or year) and youll be the one that everyone made money off.

What do you do to protect yourself from the crash? You analyse the cause of the potential crash, do your due diligence. If you truly believe that the market is going to crash, look for an anomaly. Maybe a certain stock that tends to do the exact opposite of what the market does (negative Beta). There is one very popular stock that has had a negative Beta for months, and it’s price is up 4500% over the year. Weird.

It's almost the same as a very high yield savings account with some mild price fluctuation. In the event of a crash, accompanied by a big interest rate drop (like we saw in March 2020), Treasuries see a big spike in price (just go check out the chart for VGLT). The idea is to sell near the top of this spike, make some profit, then capitalize on the discount stock prices.

6/30/2021 4:44,stocks,"If you think a crash is coming, depending on your risk tolerance and investment style, you will react differently. for example:

**A very cautious investor** would sell and wait, eliminating his or her upside potential but also eliminating any risk of loss. This person may miss out on several green days while waiting for a crash. on the other hand, if a crash was to come soon, they will not lose any money.

**a cautiously optimistic investor**, one which is willing to take a chance, will hedge their bets. they will build their cash reserves in preparation- so that they can load up the truck full of great businesses selling at a discount! This investor is optimistic that a crash is not likely to happen and so is willing to continue buying at the same time. best of both worlds. This investor may not make amazing returns as they are investing less money in the market, however when a crash does happen, they have a cash reserve to load up, and thus lower their average cost by a decent margin. possibly pushing returns even higher than if they were to continue buying at the top like a fully optimistic investor would do.

**A very optimistic investor** will continue buying no matter what. They do not believe a crash is coming, they may be right, they may generate amazing returns, but these returns come at a risk. if a crash does happen it will wipe most of this investors gains. This investment style is aggressive / adventurous it is good for investors that have a long time horizon, or investors that have a high risk tolerance.

Then there is the hype beast Tesla. 
With the major automakers releasing what I believe to be a better product and is cheaper with a strong back bone of repair/service supply, I just don’t see the value in Tesla and that bubble is waaaaaaaay too big. Tesla has made no attempts to enter the fleet vehicle market and that is where I believe the EV battle will be won.

Either the United States will self-destruct in which case you won't need any money, or the market will rebound like it always has in tbe past.

6/30/2021 8:00,stocks,"A crash?  No, dips, yes!   When the Fed speaks of tightening we will get a dip as it ultimately slows business growth so the market adjusts.  Now if we get run away inflation and the Fed is chasing it, then the dip gets much deeper.  If we reach an inability to manage inflation then the market correction becomes more severe and might be called a crash.  If your investment perspective is daily or hourly, then any dip feels like a crash. If your investment perspective is 6 months or longer then dips can be buying opportunities.  If you feel panic, then your judgement will be clouded, increase your time perspective and see if the panic level diminishes.  Dips are good ways to panic investors out of positions at a loss.  Learning to weather the storm is an acquired skill.  Have a little cash to buy the dips and relax."

One of the biggest mistakes you can make is to try and read the tea leaves to either time or predict the market.  True crashes are somethin that is impossible to actually predict in my book.  You may be able to predict small corrections and dips but not a crash, by their very nature crashes are so outside the norm that they are opaque in both timing and scope."

6/30/2021 9:14,stocks,"“New to the market” so what’s your basis is crash is coming? People think the sky is falling every single year. This is nothing new. 

“Bear vs bull” - this is kinda the market. 

No one can predict a crash hardly. Someone did once, and got a whole movie. It could crash next month, or in 10 years."
6/30/2021 9:30,stocks,"Not this year, my money is on a market correction in 2022 or 2023 depending on when the fed raises interest rates. I'm still in it for the long haul. trying to time the market doesn't work. You get out too early and the correction is less than when you pulled out or worse you FOMO back in and then it crashes. All I know is that if I'd put my money in something safe when I started saving for retirement I'd have much less than I have riding through market corrections since the late 1980's"
6/30/2021 9:31,stocks,Over 5 million mortgages are not being paid. 2.5 million are over 90 days late. These people are going to get evicted and put even more strain on the rental market. The housing market is way over valued right now. Once the evictions and foreclosures hit there will be more than enough houses on the market. It's truly a suckers market right now
6/30/2021 9:32,stocks,"On average there are three 5% and one 10% correction every year. 

When they raise rates there will probably be a hissy fit just like last time they tried."
6/30/2021 9:39,stocks,"This sub is so indicative of just how afraid the average investor is lol. No wonder it's so easy to make money just holding onto a total market index fund. When times are bad, people panic, when times are good, people panic.

love seeing these ' a crash is coming!' dolts. One day you will be right like abroken clock"
6/30/2021 9:45,stocks,"Time and time again, time in the market Trump's timing the market. If your first thought at a massive drop isn't ""Oooo, my best performers are on sale!"" then you need to re-evaluate your investment strategy. I stick to stocks that I plan to see do well for the next 40 years. If you're really concerned, just go with a Vabguard 500. You'll do better than every Hedge Fund manager out there."
6/30/2021 9:45,stocks,"> do have stop losses set for my bigger positions on the off chance.

Why?"
6/30/2021 9:47,stocks,"I love these topics, it allows me to sort by controversial to see the **actually** useful comments.  A shame the sort by most negative votes has been removed."
6/30/2021 9:48,stocks,Keep 20-30% of portfolio in cash/money markets. The peace of mind and ability to buy dips/crashes are worth more than the opportunity cost of not investing that cash now.
6/30/2021 9:50,stocks,"I can see there being a correction any minute. But what am I doing about it? Virtually nothing. I have autodeposits coming off every paycheque. For the last few paycheques I've been letting that money go in but not buying more of my preferred low-cost index etf, so I'm building up a little bit of cash. I think if shit really hits the fan I will look into using tax-sheltered account catch-up loans to buy the dip because I'm already mostly all-in."
6/30/2021 9:50,stocks,Another one?
6/30/2021 9:54,stocks,"I'm transitioning to

realize that many people with a good track record are betting on a bust, but its unlikely it'll happen this year IMO. you need a few years for the catalysts to present themselves and the market reaction.

\- if you're new, would recommend you start something like  r stocksandshit for yourself."
6/30/2021 9:58,stocks,"At the start of this year, I was thinking there was a good chance by the end of this year.  Now, I think we're waiting until next summer or the end of next year.  But what the hell do I know?  I guess wrong a lot.

I'm not doing anything about it right now."
6/30/2021 10:07,stocks,"A crash is always possible but markets have traditionally recovered a few years later and been higher than before.

So what to do about it?

Nothing.

Just make sure you don't have all your money in stocks so that you don't have to sell any during a market downturn in case you need a new car or have some medical bills, etc. (i.e. money in stocks should be 'play' money - not something you're livelyhood depends upon)"

6/30/2021 10:16,stocks,"I know a lot of people dislike hearing of a game store stock, but there's some valuable DD like ""House of cards"" etc. Hedge funds seem to be overleveraged.

6/30/2021 10:27,stocks,"Keep working hard and invest in yourself, skill development and knowledge gain. This investment always pays back by allowing to keep your job. Have some good saving in cash. 
People say investment is best thing but having cash on hand is always a good idea. Never invest everything you have."
6/30/2021 10:48,stocks,Why does everyone keep talking about a crash?
6/30/2021 10:49,stocks,"Honestly? I'm doing nothing. Picking which stocks will do poorly is just as hard as picking which stocks will do well. And if you (the generic you) are in danger of being in a bad place financially due to a stock market crash, then you need more money in savings and less in the market.

IMO the best thing to do, always, is regularly set aside a bit of your income into savings, then, once you have enough savings to survive an emergency, switch to index funds, and never look at it.

A stop loss is just guaranteeing that you will sell at a lower price if you do sell. If you really want to make sure you get cash, sell while it's high."
6/30/2021 10:55,stocks,i am being dead serious when i say that im buying gamestop and amc as my hedge against the market. plus the negative beta is a bonus
6/30/2021 10:56,stocks,"I do not believe a crash or significant dip is coming. I think the inflation is transitional and things will level off. 

I do believe that climate crisis may literally bake us all to death if the world doesn't start reacting accordingly. Hopefully my ac stays strong and I can remain only par baked."
6/30/2021 10:57,stocks,"I don't know if it's going to happen, but I'm investing in a way that embraces the possibility.  I swapped all my index funds for ETFs so I can put a 15% trailing stop loss on them, and I'm keeping more liquid cash on hand than I normally would in a healthy/normal bull market."
6/30/2021 10:58,stocks,Currently holding 100 shares of sqqq which is most of my portfolio. Selling calls until the market hits a hard correction and then I am selling out.
6/30/2021 11:06,stocks,I haven’t done anything to prepare but I know it’s coming maybe not this year but in the next couple years there is definitely going to be a crash
6/30/2021 11:07,stocks,"You only lose if you sell. I think there is potentially a housing crash and an economic crash since the shortages on things are outrageous. This would ripple to the stocks. Also for me there is inflation concerns too. I plan to not sell and probably try and invest more into this dip.

I plan to leverage myself and pay more on debts than the stocks when the crash hits foremost. Inflated money and stock crash means better to put money on the debt.  


NOT ADVICE: Just what im doing, not a professional"
6/30/2021 11:12,stocks,"I don't suspect a crash.  You will probably see brief corrections or rotations into different types of stocks if anything.  If your concerned, save some cash to buy the dip or buy some protective puts."
6/30/2021 11:13,stocks,"According to my financial advisor whom handles 95% of my portfolio, he said there will not be a crash like last year or 2007 but more of a ""correction."""
6/30/2021 11:17,stocks,"I believe a drop is coming, but it's impossible to sell when. I don't believe it will be a proper crash, and that by holding my current investments I'll make more between now and the drop than I lose when the drop happens. Furthermore, I don't expect the drop to be long-lived, recovering within a month. It will just be a good buying opportunity."
6/30/2021 11:18,stocks,"Yup, people always afraid of a crash. I'll give you my personal example.

I was investing from 2013 to 2016 a bunch, good times, but by 2017 I was like man this shits gotta crash at some point, 2018 had hiccups but it wasn't until 2020 that it actually crashed. Crashes are *rare* gradual descents or stagnant growth is much more common and and can be just as bad.

Really any new investors should worry about **what they invest in** rather then any market crashes.

Edit: FTR I had a lot of my money on the sidelines before 2020 because of that mentality I had and when it crashed I was super confident, I knew it was rare and would recover and went all in. But I missed out on opportunity with that cash while I was hesitant for years, I actually used a bunch on my mortgage to get it down and refinance because I was scared of the market."
6/30/2021 11:22,stocks,"Yup, just weather the storm and keep buying and dollar cost averaging. If you are young and have time, the market has rebounded after every crash.

6/30/2021 12:12,stocks,I have traded through 2000 and 2009. Both times I made a lot of money. One of the keys is knowing your stock. Like how to do a real evaluation on a company to know its true worth. There tends to be a lot of panic selling. Throwing out the babies with the bathwater. Once you have identified the stocks you want to own. Wait for the Time Magazine Cover article talking about the crash of the decade. That's the sign for the bottom. Then load up and wait.

6/30/2021 12:24,stocks,There will be a black swan event. The market will drop 10%. I’m not doing anything about it because there’s too much liquidity and that liquidity is always going to seek yield.

6/30/2021 12:51,stocks,The reason they are expecting the crsah is because the hge fnds are taking all of their m$ney out of other stcks in order to pay for their fkups in GeeMeE and AyEmCee. In other words we will get our tendieeies while everyone else is fked because hegiees fked them by shoorting these 2 stocks.
6/30/2021 13:11,stocks,Invest in the larger companies that are investing in innovation. Often they pay a dividend so you get that 2-3% little gain to keep up with inflation.
6/30/2021 13:16,stocks,"Don’t assume that your stop loss limit orders will save you, they are not guaranteed to execute if a gap down happens overnight that goes below your limit order. Also you can investigate various hedging strategies and allocate a few bps of your portfolio to a rolling hedge (I use VIX options to do this). But as others have said, time is on your side ultimately."
6/30/2021 13:20,stocks,"Set stop losses below what you've seen a stock go to. Once the crash happens, wait for the dust to settle, buy a fuck ton of options."
6/30/2021 13:21,stocks,"I truly believe a crash is coming in about 10 years when everybody will shut up about a crash and economists are very confident we figured things out to smooth out cycles.

Until then I see slow growth overall for two/three years with minor corrections and continued domination from tech and green energy, another rate decrease at the slightest sign of market weakness because why not and then big returns in equities for another 5 record breaking years.

Right then, BAM!, indexes fall 75% out of nowhere bringing us back to 2015 levels and with hindsight  nobody gets why we let robots and primates manage our markets."

6/30/2021 13:32,stocks,Great lets hear from all the people who know this stuff!
6/30/2021 14:42,stocks,I agree with you. I just think it's going to take a bit longer to see lower home prices because it's going to be months before any foreclosure sales/short sales take place (except on vacant properties).

6/30/2021 14:56,stocks,"Raise some cash to be cautious. If you’re trading short term, a crash may present an opportunity. If you had cash in March of last year you’re up over 100% on many stocks. If you’re long term investing a crash is but a blip and you hope you have some cash available to buy more but in this instance I wouldn’t suggest selling stocks now to raise cash, better to just hold through."

6/29/2021 23:07,stocks,"What always bothers me about this idea is you need to get the money from somewhere. So either you aren’t DCA into plays you believe or you’re selling something to have cash on hand. 

This is also the usual advice from the “time in the market rather than timing the market” crowd. 

I’m fine with both these ideas but I’m lost how someone can be fully committed to both which means we have to discuss how much should be devoted to both. 

Just feels like a counter productive argument without sharing how to be prepared for a crash and what to look for. And again, both of these crowds tend to be bull market forever types."
6/29/2021 23:48,stocks,"He’s right. Last year during Covid I sold 115 shares of $GME at $5. I sold 90 shares of $SPCE at $18. I sold 15 shares of FDX at $150. I sold maybe $4,000 in stock to “save my ass from the market collapse”, and in just 12 months, that would have been worth $45,000. 

If you’re 50-60 years old and staring retirement in the face, I’d move to some conservative positions. But if you’ve got 20+ to invest, stay in the pocket, don’t panic and buy more!"

6/29/2021 20:35,stocks,"I have a feeling the housing market is in a bigger bubble than the stock market. Everyone with big money jumped into housing thinking they are geniuses. At least in my area, it is completely out of whack and standing on last leg pumped up by investors and speculators, and way out of reach of ""real"" buyers.  It's a matter of time before big investors realize they are just throwing money just outbidding each other. By the time they decide to sell, they will realize there aren't any actual buyers at prices they bought for, because people looking for actual homes don't have incomes necessary to pay this much. Might as well sell home while you can at the peak and buy diversified non-housing stocks, then buy a nicer one once housing inevitably corrects. It's a gamble either way, but stock market definitely looks way healthier in comparison."
6/29/2021 21:02,stocks,"While a good idea to diversify, housing prices are at all time highs so when a crash does come more and more people will have overextended themselves like back in 2008. I'm not saying this is a bad idea, but taking money from this bull market and investing in housing when it is arguably also in a bull market is likely going to be somewhat of a repeat that happened back then.

I'm looking to diversify a bit as well but looking at housing prices today is absolute insanity. I do think It will take several years for supply to catch up to demand, but like anything there will end up being more supply at some point."

There is one very popular stock that has had a negative Beta for months, and it’s price is up 4 5 0 0 % over the year. Weird.

I personally hold a lot of positions about 50ish. And I put money in pretty often. Usually $200-$500. But that can change based on whatever works for your budget. 

The key is to hold a good amount of stocks in multiple sectors. That way there is always something that is down. That’s what you put money into. 

Never sell anything. Especially if it’s down. My rule is never sell at a loss. (I’ve broken this rule a couple times.).

I'm coming to the conclusion that the demand for houses in the middle of the country will continue to increase until populations decline significantly or something worse happens to cull the migrating herd.

And there's been a drought of new  housing supply  since  '08 crash crushed a lot of development.... So in those cases it's different.. it's millennials with money saved up outbidding each other.

Regardless the housing market all operates off low interest rates , should the Fed ever need to increase rates it will create a cascade of collapsing housing prices..."

6/30/2021 9:43,stocks,"> it is completely out of whack and standing on last leg pumped up by investors and speculators

In my area it's all corporate investors buying up properties. These investors aren't flippers; they're turning the houses into rentals, which removes the houses from the market entirely forever. This creates less supply for increasing demand. 

Basically, you've said that housing is a ""bubble"" while (correctly) explaining why it's actually not a bubble.

The only thing that's going to stop this is government action, which is never going to happen because government doesn't fuck over the donor class."
6/30/2021 12:28,stocks,"It really just depends on peoples’ ability to pay. In ‘08, house payments were insane and people were relying on the ability to continually refinance.

6/30/2021 13:26,stocks,"> Might as well sell home while you can at the peak and buy diversified non-housing stocks, then buy a nicer one once housing inevitably corrects.

Except no one knows where the peak is. What if it keeps growing for another decade? Selling now could be a disaster as you'd be stuck renting and then, if you get sick of waiting for the correction that never comes, you then have to start all over, a higher entry cost.

Imagine selling your $250k home for like $450k, paying $1.5k/month rent for the next 5 years ($90k), and then buying a much worse house than what you had 5 years ago for like $350k because that's all you can afford now, and your old place is worth like $600k at this point. lol"
6/30/2021 13:47,stocks,"No way. We have a significant low in supply (~5M homes) currently building around record pace of 1.5 M homes annually. Defaults and late payments at significant lows.

6/29/2021 23:26,stocks,"A couple comments have already pointed out some of your misconception but also recognize that the last crash was due to loans being written that people couldn’t afford. People are still buying despite higher prices because of low interest. Then as others mentioned, there’s the “buy everything regardless of price and rent it out” mentality.

To think this is any way close to what happened in last real estate crash and to expect another is just lack of understanding. There will definitely be more supply as eviction moratoriums are lifted but we won’t see a full crash in prices IMO"

Everyone knows they bought at the height of the market and but also at the lowest part of the interest rates most people bought to live in this home for a long time most people are very protected with the mortgage laws aren't going to be any home losses like in 2008 people didn't get armed so their mortgage isn't going to go up they know what they're paying every month what the f*** are you talking about"

6/30/2021 1:45,stocks,"Welcome to San Francisco... I mean, that's what happened here in SF and you will be lying to yourself thinking that Austin home prices will ever go down.

You ""invited"" the big tech and you get what they bring with them - a cluster-fuck in the housing market. For them paying a million dollars for a house is the same as buying a cup of coffee for most Austin residents (paraphrasing).

A salary of $150,000 - $250,000 a year is not really a ""bragging right"" for tech employees here in SF/Silicon Valley and with that kind of income buying a half a million to a million dollars house in Austin is a walk in the park for them. So now real residents of Austin have to ""compete"" with these buyers.

I don't think Austin home values going anywhere except up-and-up for years to come.

They were paying $2 to $3 million for a 1,200 Sq Ft house here in Palo Alto. Now imagine how cheap it is for them to buy a 3,000 sq ft house with a backyard for under a million dollars."
6/29/2021 22:03,stocks,">If you can't even hope to ever own a house I think our whole system will break down

6/29/2021 23:10,stocks,"Housing was ridiculous in Austin 12-15 years ago, gentrification was just taking firm grasp of the place as they razed homes to build smash-housing apartments in South Austin, think Manchaca area. In the two years I was there I watched myself get straight up priced out of being a blue collar worker who didn't have to spend over an hour a day commuting, up to two in public transit to get from north of downtown to the proper south of Austin.

It’s pretty sick but I’m hoping for a crash. But with my luck it will crash my investments too not just out silly local real estate economy.   Personally i think people are paying 200k+ more than I would every consider paying in my life ever for the quality of home they get."

6/30/2021 7:32,stocks,"People are going to learn what they should have already - that owning a home isn't nearly the dream it's been made out to be. When you're overpaying by 20% and getting a house you had to settle for, then realizing the average 2-3 bedroom/2 bath home costs $1200 a month to keep operational on top of your mortgage, renting or having a condo sounds like a better deal. 

Homeowners who are slightly overextended just to squeeze into something they aren't thrilled with just for the sake of ownership in 25 years are going to get very frustrated in a short time when they end up under water and having to stay in that house and ride out a downturn in the market. 

Meanwhile renters are going to be saving money and having a higher quality of life due to having disposable income. I can see plenty of keeping up with the Jones spending in the next 15 years or so, leading to excessive debt among home owners."
6/30/2021 10:52,stocks,Austin will never retract. Only go flat from here. With the jobs and money in the city now this is the new norm.

Really?  Why?  Because you're used to the Texas prices?  When a city booms, like many have before they become desirable and it raises the property price.

Can you not move 45 minutes out of town to buy at a reasonable price?"

There are plenty of houses and apartments in good neighborhoods of Denver for <$500k. Very nice new construction around $1M.

Unless you have serious debt, I find it hard to believe that you can't swing a home purchase. Looking on Zillow, there are a ton of 2br apartments for sale under $400k. 2br houses under $500k. If you make ""well into the six figures"" you should be able to buy these in cash.

6/29/2021 23:33,stocks,"Do you have any sources for this? Because this seems nothing like 2008? The crash in 2008 was caused by banks making terrible loans to people who could never afford to pay them. This market is almost the exact opposite. Many people are coming with all cash offers or are putting down substantial cash thus reducing the amount of the home that is financed. Although I agree that the prices of homes seems to be high, that just might be the new norm as more people look to move into the suburbs and its not like there is tons of room to build in some of these more desirable areas... If people want affordable homes they'll have to sacrifice location and it sucks but it might be the new reality."

If spending resumes money will have to get sucked back which will cause a contraction on all of society's funds, businesses being the better shielded for it since they have sneaky ways of avoiding the tax man.

As far as i know the supply chain in semiconductors was bogged because the auto industry thought they wouldn't sell much last year so they cancelled orders, apple and others already had sizeable orders and some opted to increase their stock so ordered more than the usual. Then the auto industry changed their mind and a couple more minor things added up (drought in taiwan, china's nonsense, minor covid concerns and a fire at one of the tsmc factories) and that's what caused a ""back up"". 

TSMC and Intel both pledged big money to build more factories to prevent this, for some reason both in the same area in the US which feels dumb to me, and the possible concern there is we might be swimming in semiconductors in the future. Afaik even europe wanted to secure its supply by wanting to build a factory which was criticized by tsmc exactly due to supply potentially overrunning demand in 5 years if things spiral out of control.

As for travel? Some places yeah, people have begun to travel, others not so much. At least in Europe there's a checkerboard of countries which barely have any vaccination progress while others are doing good.

I don't know if the economy is booming but Amazon definitely is. I'm unconvinced the middle class in America is doing any better since the pandemic began. If that goes, having big corporations declare huge profits doesn't really point to a healthy economy."

6/30/2021 11:34,stocks,"What about it?

There’s many macro aspects of America that make comparison to 1980s Japan silly. Namely having the worlds strongest central bank and reserve currency of the USD and the most powerful military of all time. Orders of magnitude more manufacturing capabilities, intellectual and innovative talent sourcing the best people from across the globe to work in America for American companies. The most powerful military of all time ect, center of the financial world, geopolitical safety, the list goes on. There’s a reason why America is such a powerhouse much more so than any other country, especially one like Japan. This snowballs into its economy. America’s geography alone makes it an economic powerhouse, that’s not even counting the reserve currency, military, liberal-democratic political system and more. 

Anyone who attempts to compare the American economy to 80s Japan  is naïve and ignorant of geopolitical outcomes, the economic benefits that arise from that and America’s “global hegemony”. IMO anyone who can look at these facts and disagree, is trying to sell you something.

Second, yeah what you asked was a very valid question. I don't do DCA, but I may buy more individual stock during crashes vs ETF's/MTF's, etc as I realize for individual stocks of certain brands there's a high chance of rebounds. I may also go the more selective route vs hands off more than usual to try and maximize. Maybe some folks put off money towards certain categories in their budgets to allocate more towards investments during these times. 

Not because they don't already believe in investing, but because they realize there's a high chance of rebound and thus it can be worth putting off money towards certain things in favor of investing now (think if someone had a goal of paying house off sooner so they pay more towards a mortgage. Maybe they just pay the minimum and put the extra towards investments). 

Keep in mind people's age group as well. Folks aren't likely to be so aggressive the older they get. Chances are they will already be in a good position by a certain age and thus don't necessarily need to be doing anything past some of traditional buy and hold stuff. Others may just have variations they make to either strategy that you use for personal reasons.

Hedge funds that haven't covered their short positions in gamestop and are going to be hit hard, liquidated, and the liquidation will drive down the price of whatever stocks are liquidated.

You also have to understand that there's a lag in cause and effect.   You shoot someone with a bullet, the lag is in fractions of a second.   A hedge fund collapses in Japan and it can take months (or longer) for the effects to ripple through as its assets are liquidated.

Trump tells people to drink bleach to cure Rona, Biden/Harris think that idiots storming the capitol with no weapons in sight is an insurrection (despite how setting buildings on fire somehow is peaceful). Trump thinks that Rona is made by the Chinese  because he wants that to be true, Biden/Harris/democrats/MSM say that's not true because they want it to not be true and then also say that's true because now that Trump is out that's ok.

Another point to look into is this fear of the silver tsunami (boomers retiring). People are convinced that boomers will sell their stocks after they retire in the near future and stocks will take a dive. Because boomers have held the leadership positions for so long and worked into their 70s, gen xers were largely blocked from taking high paying jobs. Now, the silver tsunami is causing an exodus of leadership and Melleinials are filling the void. That is important because Melleinials save a much larger percentage of their pay than previous generations (apparently, entering the work force during a recession makes you frugal AF), and more importantly, they but stock with it *and* they hold it. Melleinials are much more financially savvy than previous generations.

Would you, the great prescient messiah of risk management and safe investing, condone me to buy 10K using an investing loan and deleverage over the term of the loan (5-10 years)? I have no other outstanding debt. This would result in a 3k tax return which I could put on the loan or buy more stock with. 

My point is to never hold cash because you almost always lose by doing that. But when the opportunity comes, I will continue to DCA as I always do but I personally will be considering buying using a manageable amount of leverage because with a leg down like that there is far less downside than upside at that point. I know there's more risk with leverage, literally everyone knows that. More risk more reward. Market routs are opportunities.

Right now, I think the highest risk is that related to the cost of financing going up which would in turn affect the market value of properties in the long run, including their rent-generating potential.

It's true that people need houses and demand is very inelastic. But if financing becomes out of reach that will simply force people to be creative about their living arrangements and will impact prices directly - unless the Fed will start buying houses too."

To be clear, I am saying he is delivering really bad, scary news, and not ""bad information"".

To summarize that particular book, he describes currency and the cycles of currencies and empires. The video kind of covers the debt cycle, but in the book he goes into more detail. His coverage spans thousands of years of history. Both currency and empires are intertwined. His DD is that they are cyclical. He describes their rise and their fall as well as the reasons for both. Based on his data, he feels that it is natural for currencies to be destroyed. It's just part of the cycle of empires. If you want to know why I feel that his book is in the horror genre, you should read the book. The 4th Turning is similar from the sociological POV, but it comes to a similar conclusion ie It's not the end of the world, but it will feel like it.

With the transaction costs of moving, ability to work wherever, etc. it's fair to say that there may not need to be a need for homeownership for a lot of people in the future. Getting a 30 year mortgage and actually staying in the house to pay it off like our grandparents did just doesnt happen as much. More renting may inherently not be a terrible idea.

From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship.

Tl;DR:

Tesla entered the S&P 500 to great fanfare on Dec. 21, 2020, in a rebalance of the index. It surged well over 20% in its first month, but since then has fallen, standing now with gains of about 5%, lagging the S&P 500’s (^GSPC) near-16% gain in that same timeframe.

Tesla’s entry meant one company had to leave, as the S&P 500 does not become the S&P 501 when a new company joins the club. To make room, S&P had to kick out Apartment Investment and Management (AIV) from the index, but since that December 2020 rebalance, the company’s stock spiked almost 60% — and though it went down still stands around 40% higher than it did when it got the boot."

6/30/2021 0:00,stocks,"Leveraged ETFs like SPXL or TQQQ, why not? I’ve read over and over about how not to invest in leveraged ETFs for the long term and I understand that if the ETF is based on a volatile benchmark, it’s gains and losses will be exaggerated compared to that benchmark. I also understand they may not always hit their 2x or 3x goal or whatever it is and have higher expense ratios. 

However, if the benchmark is pretty stable, SP500 or Nasdaq for example, why wouldn’t one want to buy and hold a leveraged ETF longer term? Even if it doesn’t hit a 3x goal, wouldn’t it still be more profitable than its tracked fund? 

Take QQQ and TQQQ (3x leveraged) for an example. QQQ is up 241% over the past 5 years. TQQQ is up 1,592% in the same time. 

Or SPY which is up 112% over 5 years and SPXL (3x) 440%. 

I need someone to explain to me please why it’s a bad idea to bug and hold a product like TQQQ or SPXL because what I read when I Google it doesn’t seem to apply to funds like these."

I'm actually convinced that for a lot of people who is willing to manage your portfolio a little bit, holding these instead of its non-leveraged equivalent is better (maybe not TQQQ but UPRO/SPXL definitely). It's obviously more risky and much more volatile, but if your risk tolerance is up for it, I see no reason why not. It's free extra money and unless you're a experienced day trader, it would be hard to beat these especially over long periods because these really outperforms when you left it for that long.

For one of those three stocks, it's been red by as much as $10K. I kept buying the dip, because I was able to decipher what was driving the pullback and decided those reasons are crap and I want to keep averaging down. Just in the last few days, it has gained almost 15% over its lowpoint, and thanks to averaging down, I'm only 15% more from my break-even point, and the company still stands 100% on track with my expectations.

Did Intel fail to innovate on their x86 platform? Yes. But x86 started hitting the heat wall in the early 2000s, and it took AMD a really long time to innovate in that tech space. Maybe it really was a strategic business decision, and they took it because AMD made a horrible move with bulldozer. Intel definitely has floundered. But as someone fortunate enough to have both a Haswell-E build and a Zen3 build, for general computer purposes, I honestly didn't notice the differences between the CPUs as much as benchmarks seem to indicate I should.

It's not like there will be a sudden flood of new applications. The modules available have included CPUs for decades. AMD isn't bringing anything new.

In the short term, the market is a voting machine. Supply and demand. In the long term, it is a weighing machine, and my point stands just fine, I think. I’m the long term, the return of the company has very little to do with the market and everything to do with its actual commercial performance. 

If a company is valued at more than your expectation of its discounted future cash flows, when you buy that company, you either a) expect to hold onto it long term and expect to lose money b) you expect to get out of it in the short or medium term and leave someone holding the bag c) you expect market irrationality to continue indefinitely. 

I don’t think you’re saying a) or b), I think you’re saying c). If so, you’re in for a shock"
6/30/2021 3:29,stocks,This is the dumbest comment ever. This is all in hindsight.
6/30/2021 0:19,stocks,"120K down payment. Let’s assume after 15 or so years she has another 200K in principal paid off with around 280 left to pay back. 

If she sold her 2M house today, paid off the remaining principle plus interest, she’d probably net in the 1.5-1.7M range.  

That’s way more than a 320 percent return on a 120K initial investment.  Property taxes, insurance, maintenance/capital improvements will bring this number down, but there’s a good chance it still outperforms the broad based market.

You have to remember that real estate is usually a leveraged investment that can really kick up return rates in white hot markets like California."
6/30/2021 6:31,stocks,You also needed to pick the right place to buy that house.
6/29/2021 20:39,stocks,120k can't buy a 600k house. You have to pay interest every month. And you can get leverage in a margin account or with buying options. So it's not such a simple comparison.
6/29/2021 20:43,stocks,It is totally possible to average a 50% gain over 10 years by investing. You just need to have an aggressive portfolio.
6/30/2021 5:52,stocks,"It's not true that if the internal rate of return is negative based on *the most optimistic analyst's expectation*, that you will lose money. Your claim is now that analysts can always predict future earnings. Analysts have been very wrong at times."
6/30/2021 14:18,stocks,"> expectation of its discounted future cash flows

How much into the future? I'm saying d) because there aren't many alternatives to stocks anymore (except for real estate), people are willing to look further into the future. So yes, demand will stay high for far longer than it has in the past. Will prices go too high and is there a correction coming? Of course. There always is eventually. But my guess is that the correction is not going to get prices back to what you would call rational. I think we are entering a new era of markets where P/E ratios will be sustainably much higher than in the past. Never before in the past were there this many retail investors and that number is only going to go up. Every year more and more average folks are spending on stocks instead of buying a new car. This permanently changes things with an increased demand.

Also what everyone thinks is that they are picking the next Amazon or Netflix. Some of them will be right. And in hindsight there was nothing irrational about buying Amazon when it's P/E ratio in 2012 was over 3000 but you could snatch the stock for a beautiful 1/10th of its current price. You could hardly call that gambling type speculation or that current stock holders have been left holding the bag. People guessed right that Amazon would change the world and profit hugely from it."
6/30/2021 9:06,stocks,"Hard disagree.  You need to know if you underperformed or outperformed over a given benchmark.  You should generally view the S&P 500 as your benchmark return rate for capital deployment.  Comparing an investment to this helps gauge its success.  It’s a valuable way to calculate opportunity cost over a long period.  If you underperformed an average market return over a 10 year period, you shouldn’t be thrilled.  

Comparing an investment to the return of a random stock is dumb (I.e. those insane articles titled: “if you invested $1000 in XXX stock 2010…”).  Looking at that in a vacuum, you may assume you really missed out, however if your benchmark average return actually returned more, then you didn’t.  If I invested $1000 in <risky tech stock> and returns 250% over 10 years, I may think I’m a genius.  However, if the market returns over 300%, my risk-adjusted return severely underperformed. 

A caveat to this: Diversification is important, so comparing returns across asset classes is difficult.  Having real estate in a portfolio doesn’t make it a bad investment just because it doesn’t return as much as the market average over a given period.  Same with gold or bonds.  However, the average market return is still a valuable way to gauge the success of your total deployment of capital on a risk-adjusted basis."
6/30/2021 6:31,stocks,California being a white hot market has the benefit of hindsight. What about all the people who bought in a housing market that has underperformed?
6/30/2021 8:32,stocks,You’re completely missing the point

6/30/2021 13:37,stocks,"Ok true. Amended as follows to remove that, my point still stands. 

It is objectively true that if the internal rate of return is negative on a stock purchase vs *your own* most optimistic expectations of future cash flows associated with that company, *you expect* that will not make money on it in the long run. You are left with short term speculation as your only means to make profit."
6/30/2021 16:42,stocks,"Cash flows would be discounted to infinity. This doesn’t add as much as you would think as the terminal value can be lower than you might think due to what is effectively reverse-compounding. 

To your point about permanently high multiples, this situation isn’t new. Japan has been where we are before, in the 80s. Their stock market reached sky high p/es. It crashed in 1989 and it *still hasn’t recovered*."
6/30/2021 8:26,stocks,"What about it?

6/30/2021 0:50,stocks,"Ok, so as much as i adore a good usable UI, UI is not a technological innovation. Its very important but not a technological innovation. I accept your point about M1 chips, but apart from that everything else that you listed: apple is not leading the industry in any of those even if they did pioneer it. Also what we are talking about it what apple has done and not what apple ia going to do. If they do come up with a search engine that can beat google in its quality or a self driving car that can beat waymo. I'll change my POV."
6/30/2021 12:15,stocks,"Its not UI. Its engineering design. The iPhone 4 is without a doubt the most groundbreaking technology that has faced the web since the web. It singlehandedly accelerated the idea of a smartphone, to the point where smartphones are now more common than PCs and every web company now caters to them more as they own more of the web share.

Even if you disagree on that, I just listed their technological innovations (multitouch control, ultra thin shells for laptops, Webkit browser engine, AR/VR universal API, an entire new subdivison of computing (tablets), gesture control, secure enclave, Siri, FindMy, global Tor, ResearchKit to aid medical research)

M1 is an example of engineering design. There's no scientific breakthrough with it, just clever engineering design.

>apple is not leading the industry in any of those even if they did pioneer it.

??

Last I checked Apple are the number 1 smartphone maker by revenue. They are the number 1 tablet maker by revenue and sales. They are the number 1 smartwatch maker by a country mile. Number 1 app store by revenue, almost double Google's.

They have an insane 66% marketshare in the US, 75% of US App store revenue and 80% of time spent on the Internet. Even crazier is that they are still growing. LG has dropped out, Google's hardware is a flop, Samsung is losing ground to Apple in the Western markets.

There's a reason why so many tech companies follow what Apple does and why even the biggest tech companies, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon cannot out leverage Apple. Google pays Apple $10B in straight cash just to be their default browser. 43% of Facebook's business comes from the US. 66% for Amazon.

The smartphone was the next evolution in human computer interaction, and if we're talking about making money on that then you have to go through Apple. Whats the next evolution? AR/VR (the pieces are slowly coming into place, appclips, findmy, apple watch gesture control, apple indoor maps, lidar screening, powerful small chips, better Siri needed) , wearables with gesture control (Apple watch already does this), and the car."
6/30/2021 12:34,stocks,"By saying that apple is not a market leader in the things you mentioned.. i didnt mean the devices.. i meant AR,VR, Siri, etc.. the ""innovations"" by apple as you put it."
6/30/2021 15:16,stocks,"And you'd be wrong again. AR/VR Kit is one the best AR/VR APIs for developers, and I can safely bet that an Apple AR device is going to be a lot more popular than a Google, Facebook or Amazon one.

Siri was the first voice assistant on a phone, and unlike Google or Amazon, user privacy is more important than mass data collection. Hence why Siri is more limited but is also more private and can run locally. 

What's next? Webkit browser engine is what Google and Microsoft use lol. RsearchKit is miles ahead of an Android equivalent. 

I think its pretty clear that you simply aren't that knowledgeable on how dominant and respected Apple are in the software dev and web industry."
6/30/2021 15:17,stocks,Ok
6/30/2021 15:28,stocks,"Arkit for apple will always be dominated by apple because its their fuckin ecosystem, they will always have an edge. Webkit was started in steve jobs era (and i never said apple didnt innovate in his era). Siri is not a market leader, period. reasons dont matter. If we leave things that steve started, then there are very less things to point out as true innovation (again, not zero). Apple's innovation now is nothing compared to what other companies are doing.  

And, i'm not continuing this thread anymore, its clear you're a apple fanboy."

6/29/2021 20:28,stocks,"Where to begin???  First, Type II diabetes is much more common than Type I---about 10-20 times more common.  Perhaps you are referring to the fact that many type II diabetics eventually become unable to secrete insulin (which is more ""Type I-like""), but by that time, teplizumab would likely not be beneficial (see next comment)  Second, a quick look at how teplizumab works shows that it would have be given to newly diagnosed patients, or those very early in the progression of their disease.  Therefore, it would not be useful in most of the 1.4 million or so currently diagnosed patients--only those very early in the disease process, and any newly diagnosed.  If you are a pharmacist, you should know this.  It is an interesting drug and a potential game changer for newly diagnosed type I patients."
6/30/2021 7:23,stocks,"I’m not sure where to begin???????? Those stats I mentioned were CDC data on…type 1 diabetes incidence, not prevalence in the US….We are finding out that more adults getting diabetes are actually….Type 1 diabetics and not type 2. Secondly, those numbers were incidence of type 1 diabetes in one year. This year will likely result in a similar incidence rate. And the next year and the next year after that. The biggest change to how it’s used would be screening for those about to show symptoms for T1D because much of the early progression is asymptomatic  and it would be most effective given before our body destroys much of the insulin secreting cells. So thank you for the useless criticism"
6/30/2021 11:03,stocks,"From the 2020 CDC report:

• 5,758 children and adolescents age 10 to 19 years with type 2 diabetes.

The numbers you originally posted are indeed the prevalence of Type 1, not incidence.

Also from the CDC:

The most common of diabetes is type 2. According to the CDC, 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes in the United States have type 2. Just 5 percent of people have type 1.

Would suggest everyone carefully read the CDC report.

Completely agree with your next to last sentence, but will be difficult since about 7 million with diabetes are undiagnosed......definitely need to work on diagnosing earlier.

Sorry that you find discussion/challenge useless.  Again, I think it is an intersting drug and potential game changer for patients with Type 1, providing the health care community gets better at early diagnosis."

6/29/2021 23:30,stocks,"I dont know how to do the quotes thing in reddit but in response to this part... ""Also if the economy collapses, everyone will attempt to take their gold out of the ETF or sell it,thus plummeting the price of the stock.""

ETFs work by arbitrage, if the market price (MP) differs too much from the net asset value (NAV) then the distributor/manager will buy or sell more shares to bring equilibrium to the stock price.  It's why the SEC requires ETFs to show standardized performance for ETFs to have market value and NAV pricing.  So, basically if the underlying holdings (NAV) are always going up (gold price increasing) then the etf (MP) will always go up - Market price will attempt to achieve NAV...  Highly recommend researching arbitrage if you are bored, its actually kind of interesting.  

Commodities are extremely volatile.  So much so that it is literally required on every marketing piece for a commodity security to include the line ""Commodities generally are volatile and are not suitable for all investors.""  No other investment class needs that disclosure."

Who the hell knows obviously, but I’m getting wary"
6/29/2021 21:37,stocks,"hard disagree

Where are you getting that interest rates are increasing soon?  The fed has remained steadfast that they are not increasing rates.

Not trying to be a dick or anything, but ive been having these discussions with bears for the past 4 months.  Ive been told repeatedly that the market is overvalued and that we were at the top and yet new ATHs keep getting hit. And any ""correction"" is minor and fleeting at best.

The fact of the matter is that COVID cases are decreasing and everything is opening back up.  Americans are at a 50 year high in savings and are biting at the bit to get out there and spend. Unemployment is decreasing and companies are hiring like crazy.  Companies (largely tech) are posting record breaking quarter after record breaking quarter. The fed has kept interest rates at 0%.  

When you combine all these factors together what you get is what we have been seeing the past 3 months...a bull market.  I have yet to see any indications that its over or slowing down.  I think in the next 6 months we will easily see 5% gains in the major indexes.  But like you said...who the hell knows"

6/30/2021 5:17,stocks,"I thought about this and let's look at a few things.

Cash to debt. Msft's debt is covered by cash flow 125.2%. 58 billion debt. 134billion equality so it has great financial strength.

Msft gross profit margins 2016-2020 are 65%. 2021 3rd quarter revenue is 41.7 billion.  High profit margin companies are typically safe.

Annual revenue growth is 19%

Return on investment is 21.1%

It is the only other company to have a triple A rated stock with higher credit rating than the US government.

So tell me which part of any of that tells you msft is a bad deal? I am making far more consistently with msft than anything else. I don't see why I would take out considering all known data."
6/30/2021 7:42,stocks,"I think you missed the point a bit, MSFT is a great company and I'd love to invest in it. The financials you just laid out are some of the reasons. But it's trading at a 37 PE and over 40x free cash flow. If you're happy paying 40x free cash flow that is fine, but you've got to understand how incredibly high that is for a company that is so large it can't continue to grow exponentially (Revenue growth has been decreasing for the last 5 years). 20x would be a reasonable number based on the numbers you laid out.

A channel called Everything money made a great video about it a few days ago if you're interested. 

I don't think msft is a bad investment but this subreddit has a hard on for it lately and just ignore the fact it has a 2T marketcap and is trading at way higher multiples than it was a few years ago with less growth potential."

You’re fucking welcome.

6/30/2021 13:19,stocks,"I’m genuinely curious what company you work for. Not trying to be a smart ass, but I look around and very few companies are paying “well over $100k”. Sure a company paying $50k tell them to get fucked, you scroll down and the same job at the next company is paying $65k for the same entry level position.

Of course, $65k is far, far away from “well over $100k” and still $10k less than what is “pretty typical”

So again, genuinely curious where you work. I’m in Denver, a major metro area, on par with California for cost of living but with 1/2 the pay generally (under 1/3 compared to Silicon Valley) so I’m sure your company has an office here.

Go ahead and pm me if you don’t feel comfortable saying it publicly."
6/30/2021 18:54,stocks,"A share in a company is a share in the current assets and future profits

A stock can be compared to a bond. A bond pays a known amount of money in the future (plus some risk of default) and often has a fixed end date while a stock pays an unknown amount of money in the future, indefinitely (plus some risk of bankruptcy).  

For a stock past performance only matters to the extent that it hasn’t been withdrawn though dividends and buybacks (so has a surplus of assets in the bank so to speak) and that good past performance suggests future good performance.  This is why a good earnings report for a stock that puts cash in the bank can be negative for stock price if it wasn’t good enough.  People estimate less future cash flows and are willing to pay less for the stock."

6/30/2021 12:37,stocks,"\> Interesting take, since they’ve been profitable for nearly their entire existence and are taking in more revenue now than they ever did at the height of their popularity. It’s fun to lie, right?  

&#x200B;

You seem to confuse profitability with revenue. But that's OK; people come here and end up learning stuff.

Here are some good quotes: ""the company has been in the red the past three years""  They even lost millions in the 1st quarter of this year.  When they went private in 2016, they had $12 million in debt.  A few months ago, they had $1.2 \*billion\* in debt.  They aren't worth 4x what they were 4-5 years ago.

And see what our friends over at that other board have to say about it.

On top of that, their newish CEO has a proven track record in the telecoms industry and is an absolute stud. Methinks you're shorting the stock lol
