2021-05-27 19:35:18,stocks,First a question. What exactly are you calling the price? The actual price in dollar amounts or The company valuation?
2021-05-27 19:42:47,stocks,"Don’t they have like a price to sales ratio of around 50?

2021-05-27 19:43:46,stocks,"OK, that’s what I suspected. A company total value is split up among all of its stock. So if a company has more shares available it would be a cheaper price per share than another company with the same value but less shares.

Don’t make the mistake of thinking that a share price means much of anything. What matters is company valuation. And Cloudflare is quite expensive at about 50 times its sales."
2021-05-27 19:45:15,stocks,Thank you. Very informative
2021-05-27 19:28:09,stocks,That sounds like one of those made up things that sound like they mean something but really don't like number of 401k millionaires.  Technically the only money entering the market are the people buying IPOs.  Every other stock purchase also corresponds to a stock sale so it would be net even.  There may be some site that shows the total value of IPOs per year.

2021-05-27 18:01:36,stocks,I bought when it was around $10 per stock (after the fraud reports came out). I agree that it probably wasn’t the smartest move but I gained about 15% (today) & 50% overall. You’d recommend that I sell it all? Including the stocks and options ?

I initially invested in NKLA because I predicted that it would go up & I was right. It may go down but it’s a risk I’m willing to take, I think I’m just going to hold and see what happens."

Ok good FOR YOU, most people do that but there is STILL room for a speculative portion of your portfolio.

YOU will never catch the TSLAs, Squares, Amazons of the 2020s based on your logic, I'm doing very well having a mix, but sure keep on investing in Kraft and bonds lol.

The fact you couldn't even educate yourself on where NKLA is as of today before spouting LIES shows your ignorance and I'm way more confident in my due diligence than that of a lazy redditor such as yourself.

>You can enjoy losing your money in the long run when this company goes under.

Lol I've build a portfolio over 7 years of active trading beating the S$P and becoming a millionaire at a rather young age.

4) Take all that you have learned now and beat the market, the thousands with more experience and knowledge

or you can invest today in vanguard index funds"
2021-05-27 17:41:00,stocks,"You’re doing it within 4 days, meaning that you should be looking for technical analysis movements rather than macroeconomics & business factors

I’d say, decide your investing timeline: long term, you should find companies that have been performing well in the long run (good profit margins, good management & good shareholder value) & hold to reap the longer term success

If you want a shorter time frame, look for technical analysis indicators that can predict, to a certain degree, of how the price could perform on an intraday/daily timeframe as traditional business metrics and valuations aren’t very important at all within a 4 day time period (unless there’s an earnings report or external information, but on a general basis they’re not important)

For technical analysis I use tradingview but YouTube videos should give you the basics

For long term information I mainly use company websites & yahoo finance 

All imo! Hope it helps"
2021-05-27 17:49:04,stocks,"Thank you! That's already a huge help! I've indeed been looking at things like Yahoo Finance, but considering the small amount of investment I've initially done to try, I think that's also stifled me somewhat. I felt that long-term investments would only be worth it with larger sums.   


I've had a friend of mine talk up daytrading, which I assume has more to do with technical analysis than business analysis. So I'll look into some of that and see what I can learn! Thank you again!"
2021-05-27 18:02:33,stocks,"Over the long run 20+ years) adding a small amount each month to an index fund or etf (also worth researching) can build a strong portfolio due to compound interest and can form a strong second retirement income 

But yeah if you’re good enough, it’s more capital and time effective to day trade a small account to into a bigger one. 

I do both but I’m more actively concerned with day trading & swing trading. It must be stressed there there’s no way to know 100% which way the market is going to move, but good day traders can be correct  60%+ of the time

Good luck with the markets!

XLC has a lot of growth and tech-focused holdings, so if you're looking to truly diversify away from QQQ, I don't think it's a great choice necessarily. The SPDR sector funds are all pretty solid though. I have been long on XLY (consumer discretionary) for a while, and while TSLA has caused it to dip a bit recently, it's a solid fund with some great holdings.

But when you have the balls to sell, then be happy with the money you just made. You made it because of your decision and no one can take it. THE WORST THING you can do is sell and get back in after it keeps rising or starts falling. Both are amazing death traps to neutralize your previous profits.

Learned that lesson when I started, roughly 5 or 6 years ago. Back then I had 2k and made an amazing high risk trade that returned a profit of 12k after a single day, so I had 14k. Those were options on oil with a price of 0.02 (the lowest it can go) and I put in all of my money. A tweet from the previous president made that happen - but that contract didn't stop at 0.12 where I sold, it surged up to beyond 1.50. Just to realize how much I missed out, I could have made 75 times of what I put in, or 2000x75=150000€ just after starting with 2k. So what happened afterwards? I went for the next one at 0.02 and put in 2k again. This time it went down. And it went really far down. The broker started closing my positions because I was hitting the margin call and at that point I sold the rest. Luckily I still had 3.5k left, but that could have wiped out pretty much all of my account by being stupid as hell."

But trust me, having made 1.5k on that didn't cheer me up while knowing I also lost 11.5k of the same profit. Nothing of my original investment was hurt, in fact I was up 75% after the loss, but yea I guess you get the point. But if you truly believe the pump will continue for a while go for it. You could even go back in and set a stop loss right away. If it goes down 10% let it close, don't look back. The 10% on 175% is of course then a loss of 17.5%, but you can sleep well knowing your position exists and at worst you still made roughly 157.5% (though the stop loss will most likely not nail it). With the stop loss I recommend also a limit order but lower than the stop loss, to avoid insanely low selling but keep it lower to make it more likely that it will get sold."

2021-05-27 16:39:25,stocks,"Stock trades in individual *lots*. Most *good* brokers (i.e. not RH) show you individual lots and let you sell them *individually*.    

The average is a useful summation, but it is for informational purposes only, the tax man DGAF what your average is, what they care about is your per-lot cost basis and your sell price. You can maximize your taxes by buying/selling specific lots to realize losses or to re-set cost basis via losses suffered elsewhere.   

 - Average is informational only.   
 - Average as a trading strategy is dumb.   
 - Buy and sell individual lots, and treat them as individual assets you hold with specific cost basis.   
 - You can slowly attempt to move in/out lots to change your overall cost basis while keeping your total similar and more importantly your risk/diversification similar. But great care is needed (and a mix of ups/downs in the share price).   

PS - A ""lot"" is: one security, on one date, at one price. If any of those things differ it will be considered a different ""lot."" Even one order can generate multiple lots if the price varies."
2021-05-27 17:23:44,stocks,"I think this example is getting lost in trying to explain it with a single asset.

The best way to look at investment is that your money at any given time could be doing one of a million things, and you are choosing which is the best possible thing it could be doing right now.

So it's more like this:

Bought ABC at $10 a while back, can sell for $30 now. Why are you selling -> seems it's going to go down from now so sell high.

Fine then, sell. Now it's cash. Is it cash for long? Are you going to wait for ABC to get down to $20? No. The cash is getting invested into YYY that is currently at $10 and you think it will become $30.

Fast forward, now ABC is $20 again, and YYY is $30. Do you sell YYY to buy ABC? No, because ABC will only get to $30, but YYY is slated to get to $50 in the same time frame.

This is the same logic by which it makes sense to take a loss and sell at a bad stock time, if there's a better opportunity elsewhere.

Say you are all in YYY and it tanks overnight. You bought at $10 but it fell to $8. But ABC fell to $5 and you feel certain that ABC will climb back to $30 faster than YYY. Then sell YYY, take the loss, and get into ABC asap. Because of the million things your money could be doing right now, getting into ABC is the best thing you can see in this very moment, including taking the loss at YYY.

The past already happened, you can't change it by holding on to a bad position. The future begins now, if you are going to seize it, you need to reevaluate and find the best opportunity for now.

That's why every action is a reset."

In your case you're overthinking with average cost.

2021-05-27 16:32:44,stocks,"Average cost is useful in some instances, but not in others - I think your trying to force it into the latter - you buying a stock that used to be $10 for $20 doesn't really matter as far as once you've bought at 10 / sold everything at 30 you're done with that stock, it's a clean reset, and any stock in existence today you can pick a point in time when it was cheaper, but the question is did you hold or not"

When you split or reverse, the price is pretty much just multiplied by whatever factor that split/merge happens at.  However, the market can react differently on both of those.

Safest thing to do is pretty standard investing, index funds, stocks, etc.  Real things, homes, commodities, real estate also tends to do well with inflation.

A more risky approach would be margin trading or even just taking out a large loan.  If you think inflation is coming, then capitalizing on the current low interest rates is the right way to play things.   Get the biggest loan you can afford and invest that money in the above mentioned assets."
2021-05-27 14:52:12,stocks,I bought $BND as a hedge.  It doesn't bleed value as stocks rise but should retain value better during a crash.
2021-05-27 16:15:34,stocks,"The value premium has historically been greater during periods of high inflation and lower/negative during periods of low inflation/deflation. REITs also have done very well historically during inflation. 

 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/most-investors-dont-like-accelerating-inflation-but-this-one-group-does-11614030315

The low inflation environment over the past 10 years, combined with an overcorrection in tech following the tech bubble crash, can explain much of the outperformance of growth over value over the past decade. Companies like Apple traded at very low P/E despite significant growth opportunities, putting them in a position and prime environment to outperform.

I think with inflation concerns and sky high growth valuations following the pandemic, the value premium is in a position to resurface.


In my Roth IRA, I'm mostly in value indexes and a REIT index.

In my taxable brokerage, I'm heavily in VYM which is a high dividend index, which leans towards large cap value, as well as VIG(large cap blend), SPHD(large cap value), and a couple REITs(O, WPC). The idea is producing income for myself to worry less about timing my sells when I need to withdraw, while having mostly value exposure."

2021-05-27 17:19:16,stocks,">A lot of big name investors believe either hyper inflation is coming, interest rates will be raised / the stocks will take a hit or a scenario where both could theoretically happen.

Man the word or is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. It's like saying ""most scientists believe that there is almost certainly life in the universe in the form of bacteria and microbes or that aliens live among us and control our lives.""

Inflation is coming, that's almost certainly a fact. High inflation, maybe hitting 5%? Could be. Hyperinflation? I don't know of a single credible source even suggesting its a remote possibility. The difference between inflation and hyperinflation might as well be the difference between bacteria and lizard men running the White House."
2021-05-27 16:35:29,stocks,"Gold is not a good hedge against inflation for a number of reasons:

1. When inflation happens, interest rates rise. Rising interest rates are bad for precious metals because investors flock to assets with yields.

2. Gold prices have already increased in anticipation of inflation. Gold prices are already up about 20% since the start of the pandemic. Much of the returns from precious metals are driven by changing investor sentiment rather than tracking inflation. Declining interest rates cause inflation fears, which drive up prices before inflation even happens. By the time inflation happens and rates go up, gold prices decline. Just look at what happened to gold/silver prices after the GFC. Hit an ATH of about $183 in 2011 due to inflation panic, then crashed down to just over $100 in 2015, and never fully recovered until last summer when money printing fears resurfaced."
2021-05-27 16:37:44,stocks,"BND would be one of the worst hedges for higher than anticipated inflation, because bonds have a fixed return. When interest rates on new bonds rise due to inflation, the price of your existing bonds decline, and the inflation may exceed the interest the bond pays.

Look at a 5 year chart of BND. You'll see that in 2016-late 2018, prices declined as interest rates rose. Then 2018-mid 2020, prices grew as interest rates dropped. Then lastly, late 2020 to early 2021, prices dropped because long term interest rates have been climbing due to inflation fears.

Bonds are more of a hedge to equities losing value as a result of economic stagnation. It is less volatile than stocks, and when the economy enters recession, usually interest rates go down which boosts bonds."

And the fact Burry is your source should really make you think, its like taking advice on China from Ray Dalio or Peter Schiff on pretty much any market crash."
2021-05-27 16:49:50,stocks,"TIPS provide interest based on a fixed rate plus the CPI inflation rate. Currently their fixed rate is 0%. This means that they provide a return close to the inflation rate as defined by CPI. The risk is that CPI may not match the increase in costs you face as determined by your own purchasing habits.

The downside to TIPS is you won't earn any real return on them, they will only maintain capital. After taxes on interest, as well as ETF fees, they likely actually produce negative real returns. But that's sort of a price to pay for certainty.

If you want to maintain risk, but perform better under inflation, Value stocks have a historical tendency to perform better during periods of inflation. https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/insights/value-stock-opportunity

Value funds such as VTV track large cap value. Keep in mind value is still risky, with a high standard deviation, and they have a tendency to perform worse than the overall market when the economy is stagnating. So it's by no means a ""safe hedge""."

As a lot of people are confused about r/m's. What happens is a publicly traded company dies. They essentially abandon being the ticker by going bankrupt or just closing up shop. Someone comes in and cleans up issues the ticker has. Then a company that wants to go public buys the shell and moves their company in. Not bullshitting and saying these are 0 risk plays. What it is though is a good DD play.

Also because this seems to be needed. You're damn right I have a position."

2021-05-27 13:22:35,stocks,"I did a fair amount of DD after the reverse merger was announced. I got started at 12 and averaged up at 13.  I think it has long term legs on it but there's also a huge amount of retail who will sell this off and try to rebuy it at 13. It will take more than today's catalyst imo to push it to 15.  

It's also a recovery play, and people are pouring into those too quickly imo. The news today is because Airbus increased production but it takes years for these companies to realize any profits from orders. Airplanes literally take years to build and deliver. 

I do like the stock, but today is catalyst day and retail is half soured half interested since the reverse merger. If you get started today just be easy cause it's usually a slow mover and it will take awhile to find it's new low."

2021-05-27 13:23:11,stocks,"While I do find it interesting that the VIX is getting absolutely destroyed today and yesterday and you're not seeing a bigger reaction out of the market, please realize that the VIX was in the low 20s late last summer and at its highest this month it was higher than that...with the SPX some 500-700 points above where it was last summer.

In fact, look at the history for it. Where it goes depends more on if you have a boring tape or not, and not on market direction.

Unless something really serious occurs, it probably is on its way to printing a lower low close tomorrow with a holiday weekend.

The more interesting thing would be technically you've seen a VIX swell (which is usually seen as being bad), but I wonder if getting a lower low close would negate that and unless something crazy happens tomorrow, the VIX is going to print a rejection for May as well."
2021-05-27 18:15:05,stocks,"VIX did go lower today yet S&P 500 is moving sideways. There is no apparent uptrend for S&P 500 at this point. In fact, it could be a double top. 


I have been [watching VIX and it’s related indexes](https://alphapursuits.com/what-to-do-when-stocks-go-down/) and it seems VIX, VIX9D ratio and VIX, VIX3M ratio are at the low end that something interesting might happen soon.

Dumb investors got burned. Learn the ropes before you make it to the top. I myself snapped up Roku at 288, UWMC at 6.8, and many other great deals by sitting out and being bearish.

2021-05-27 17:24:07,stocks,"what are you talking about? 

Bears were saying COVID was gonna crash the market. Bulls were saying that's bullshit because the stock market only goes up. 

Then the market crashes and afterwards a year of silence from bears 

Then in Feb 2021 Bears came back out after a great year of profits and told everybody that the market was overvalued and that it was time to take in profits. 

Then the market corrected. I don't know what you're talking about. 

Being bearish will always make you more money than being bullish. Always. 

Bears ride the market on its way up because the entire market is going up. Bears make money on the way down as well with puts. Bears scoop up cheap stocks at the bottom. Smart Investors are bears."

So the .4% ""$120"" plus $275 fee is $395 above their cost.   SO the deal works out to be roughly a 14.5% discount off the MSRP... e.g. save $5000 on a $35k vehicle for HODLING $1470 (todays price) of F stonk for 6 months is actually a good deal."

2021-05-27 14:07:36,stocks,"While the price is correct it’s a very misleading way to look at the situation. The dealer doesn’t just sell it for invoice (cost) because Ford says to. Ford reimburses the dealer some of that discount. Everyone in this thread saying it’s 0.4% and no big deal has no idea. If it was on a model that the dealer was willing to negotiate to invoice with no discount, than with the discount they’d likely go below invoice since they would now have more money from Ford to work with. That’s a rough summary but the discount is very good right now when nearly every model goes for MSRP and in normal times when things are more negotiable it can still be good."
2021-05-27 12:42:53,stocks,I'm not .4% but .4% is .4%
2021-05-27 16:19:19,stocks,"Technically it's MSRP (dealer price) vs Invoice (dealer cost).  Typically the dealer sets an MSRP 15% above what their factory invoice cost is... So the .4% ""$120"" plus $275 fee is $395 above their cost.   SO the deal works out to be roughly a 14.5% discount off the MSRP... e.g. save $5000 on a $35k vehicle for HODLING $1470 (todays price) of F stonk for 6 months is actually a good deal."

2021-05-27 16:05:28,stocks,"Yeah the point of this is to get a fast track straight to invoice price. You skip the vast majority of negotiation and get what is likely the best possible price you can get on the cost of the vehicle. When I worked at a dealership years ago a customer negotiating a car down to invoice was rare.

It's Ford's way of saying ""Thanks for investing, we'll drop the salesperson shebang and sell the thing to you for slightly less than what it cost us. We appreciate your business"" 

It's a huge time saver, money saver, and far more impactful than just the 0.4% discount bit. The meaningfulness of getting a car at invoice price is an easy thing to not know about."

2021-05-27 17:00:24,stocks,"I should introduce you to my 2002 F150 and 2017 F250!

The sunroof in the F250 has been replaced twice now.

The fuel tank bits came screwed up and caused the gas gauge to read incorrectly.

The replaced fuel tank pumps would later go on to fail.  Causing my dealer to keep the truck for over a month.  Thank god for the extended warranty which covered a rental vehicle during that time (even though this occurred under the factory warranty).

I did score a 40k extended service policy out of the deal.  Which covers all consumables - except fuel.  So that's pretty cool.

If you left the key fob in your pocket and you hit it wrong, the tailgate would deploy at high way speeds.  The first time that happened, it was mildly amusing and all James Bondy-ie.  Not so much afterwards.  Thankfully a quick fix there with a firmware update.

Aside from that, it at least hasn't left me stranded.  It was able to limp home with the failed fuel pumps.

My F150 - while old, doesn't have that many miles on it.  About 138k.

Many many years ago, it had relays fail that stranded me.  The intake manifold had to be replaced twice (in very, very short order).  The a/c failed - (admittedly, this one I blame  on just sheer age) in an ugly ugly way that caused the whole system to have to be replaced.

Aside from all of that, it has been a wonderful truck.

Neither of them, problem free by any means."

Guy at the dealership basically said, I can negotiate on any car in the lot, except for that one. Said they could hardly keep them on the lot, and they sold every single one at sticker.

Unless they bought them during their launch MY, your friends could’ve avoided that problem with the slightest amount of research prior to buying their cars. Ford has been pretty stellar about recalling and repairing those faulty transmissions.

2021-05-27 00:00:00,stocks,"How do bank stocks perform when interest rates increase? Stocks like bank of america, citigroup, jp morgan, american express have performed well the past months when a lot of other have seen a healthy sell of during fears of inflation and increased interest rate. My question is if this normal and expected during situations like these and if that makes them a safe investment?"
2021-05-27 12:09:00,stocks,"Traditionally banks have done *better* when rates are higher.  They pay a low amount of interest on deposits, and they charge a higher amount to lend.  That difference is called spread and the spread is proportionally higher when rates are higher.  

But it's not just about raw differential, it's also about derivatives of that, such as how the relative curves are moving, and how quickly.  

You also have parameters that can influence things.  One such parameter was made clear in a recent bank conference call in which the CEO said certain large customer segments have 3-7x as much in their savings accounts than they did prior to the pandemic.  That parameter says there's a lot of deposits made at low rates, and therefore not a lot of demand for banks to give those savers much of a rate.  Meanwhile, there's a rising demand for lending.  That's a double bonus."
2021-05-27 12:11:51,stocks,thats how they make more money
2021-05-27 12:12:23,stocks,"Banks do well because of higher interest rate but not necessarily due to inflation.  So if interest rates go up to keep inflation low but the inflation has not actually materialized then this is good for banks.  

Higher rates means that banks make more money on the deposits they have.  They take in money in your savings accounts, cds, etc, and pay you  a fraction of what it is worth and then turn around and loan it out to someone else for a much higher rate (some of that is due to default risk etc).  The issue is that the spread between loan rate and savings rate use to be higher but because the fed rate is near zero and banks are unwilling to go negative on interest rates to their customer the spread has been shrinking.  As we saw when the fed rate was over 2% higher just 15 months ago most banks were still not passing on that extra rate to savers and were pocketing the difference.  Theoretically there is a max to this, where savings rates will eventually go up with the fed rate as well, but it has been so long since that has happened it may not go back up since consumers have gotten use to not getting paid much for their cash."

Recently ranked #1 grocery chain in the U.S., with stores in Texas and Mexico. Currently family owned and 19% of stock is shared with employees. They have fantastic product development and they support smaller local producers. As an example of their dedication to entrepreneurship, during the pandemic they decided to discontinue some popular store-branded items so as not to compete with other aspiring Texas-born products. Their response to crises has set a standard (the pandemic, the winter storm of 2021) so high it is almost embarrasing for the state in comparison. Intense brand loyalty among consumers, happy employees.

The uses range from cancer research to protecting national secrets and many have doubts, but who doesn’t about early stage new technology. I just wanted to get these symbols out there because they’ve performed really well for me this year after I was told the tech is pretty much useless. Not to say that it has broad usage for every single person on earth but for the people who will be using it, it will no doubt become a powerful tool. It will especially become important when it is more wildly used throughout different industries. Looking for other takes and industry insiders opinions."

Quantum computing has potential, that is true. But the number of application is overblown. It will be critical to some applications, but useless for most. Its like all the idiots who actually think blockchain is new and magical. It isn't. Quantum will be able to solve things that numerically werent possible before due to data size. But not everything needs that much data solved simultaneously. In fact, very few things need that though those few can be very interesting.

One thing that might come from quantum is the ability to communicate over huge distances at, possibly, speeds faster than light. Think internet without any distance latency. This would open up the possibility of deep space travel. Basically you can watch the latest flicks (porn) from billions of miles away...

Another might be muti dimensional data storage. In theory, if we can stabilize a quantum state for data storage, a quantum storage device can have storage density unlike anything we have now. It would be revolutionary. Think of a box where you can store a message inside. It can be empty or it can have a letter. Now think instead of putting the letter inside, what if you pin the letter to the outsides of the box on one of the 6 surfaces? Since it has 6 sides, you can potentially store 6 messages on the surfaces and all you need to do is say which side of the box to look at to find your letter. Its the same box, but instead of 1 letter you now have 6. Quantum would be able to have a lot more than 6 sides. It will just depend on how well we can devise a way to read it."

I can’t really see how very few things need faster processing time either I think you need to do a further look into this."
2021-05-27 19:33:05,stocks,"NSA? Doubtful. Though its possible to make some hard to decrypt stuff with a QC I seriously doubt they are reliable or powerful enough right now for any actual productive use and as said before, you can easily make a non QC algo that is just as powerful. At best, they are probably just creating algorithms that might work once there is a reliable QC with enough qbits that it wont be trivial.

The cancer thing is nonsense. Makes absolutely no sense to use a QC in that manner. We literally dont have the tools for it yet.

AFAIK, we have no accurate surface scanning tech yet nor am I certain that its even possible from a practical perspective. Rather what we are trying to do is map genes to what they create and extrapolate the cell structures from that. This is probably the right way to do it but we are no where near that goal. Not even close. I mean... we just now started producing highly accurate and relatively fast DNA sequencers in the last 5 years. See Pacfic Biosciences. Im not sure how far we are on gene mapping yet and thats just step 2. There are like 3 more steps after that, each more complex than the last. So in other words, we dont need the QC for this yet. We will eventually, but probably not yet.

Now the good news is that there is a chance that we dont need to do all that to solve most cancers. If we discover a reliable deployment mechanism then we can bypass several steps. CRISPR is one potential way to do that. Not sure where we are on that research and its important to note the potential risk... aka... apocalyptic level risk (lol)"

>Market-based inflation expectations also look calmer than they have done. The Fed’s favored 5-year, 5-year breakeven, which effectively measures expected inflation from 2026 to 2031, spiked to 2.4% earlier this month. Since then, it has fallen back closer to 2.2%, the kind of level that the Fed now says (truthfully) it would be happy to tolerate: \[image\]  
>  
>This isn’t unalloyed good news. If markets don’t expect so much inflation, it implies that they also don’t expect so much growth. But after the stock market rushed in short order to historically extreme valuations, this kind of not-too-hot-not-too cold “Goldilocks” outlook is just what investors needed. It’s also just what the Fed wants to see.

2021-05-27 00:00:00,stocks,"Portfolio allocation balancing advice I just rebalanced my ETF portfolio and waned to ask if it makes more sense to 1) simply contribute the percentage you chose for that position and rebalance every once in a while or 2) contribute the positions that aren't weighted enough.

Examples:

Your portfolio target is 60% S&P 500 and 40% Total market.
The S&P outperformed the market and you now have 65% S&P and 35% To. mkt.

Should you in your next contribution ...

1) add 60% of it to the S&P and 40% to the Tot. Mkt?

or

2) add to the Tot. mkt. till it's at 40% again? / allocate it so it stays as close to 60/40 as possible?

1) has the advantage of that you‘re still contributing to the winning positions that might continue to outperform, but you need to rebalance regularily.
2) has the advantage of sticking to the right risk tolerance for you and not having to rebalance nearly as often but doesn‘t add to winning positions.

My question is, which makes the most sense? This mostly relates to portfolios that are small compared to your regular contribution (definitely for under 5y/o portfolios or if you‘re seeing massive income growth) because eventually you can‘t make a dent in the allocation and just have to rebalance regularily anyways so it makes little diference."
2021-05-27 08:43:07,stocks,"The best solution is the one that meets the requirements of your overall investment strategy. Rebalancing typically means sticking to the original plan, and when weights are out of balance you realign to your strategy weights. 

That said, if weights are really out of balance due to large gains in one or more of your assets, it might be beneficial to rethink your strategy to make sure it makes sense given current state of market.

So. 
1: You can realize some of the gains to get to right balance and this will give you some cash to see where things go in the next few: days, weeks, months. Ie new buying opportunities.

2:Add to under-performer to meet ratio. ie Get portfolio risk back to prior level.

3: Or add to both at a ratio that gets you to 60/40. ie Easiest to manage.

Im a fan of combining 1 and 3."
2021-05-27 09:45:16,stocks,"I would say:

Taxable account? Don’t sell to rebalance. Just add more to the other side until you are back in balance.

Tax advantaged account? Probably doesn’t matter much if you sell/buy or just buy to rebalance."
2021-05-27 10:29:53,stocks,"Have you got a risk target? Really that should dictate - allocating on a cash basis tends to produce results like the above, where one position is consistently skewing above the other. Really what you want is 60% of your portfolio risk coming from the S&P and 40% from the total market (for example) - this should have you add on to the S&P when vol is relatively low, and move it out when vol is high."

2021-05-27 11:14:54,stocks,"Easiest thing if you're not a data scientist might be to use TradingView or something to take a rolling 90-day standard deviation of price - I'll assume you're using VOO and VTI. Then you solve STDEV(P) = x STDEV (VOO) + y STDEV (VTI). If you're looking for a 60/40 risk allocation, your STDEV(P) is just going to be 0.6 STDEV (VOO) + 0.4 STDEV (VTI). You have a variable risk target - the usual approach is to set the risk target independently and go from there. This is going to represent one ""variance unit"" in your portfolio. 

Now you'll need to solve a system of equations. Given P (Portfolio value), a (number of VOO shares), b (number of VTI shares), VOO and VTI (prices, respectively): 

1. P = aVOO + bVTI
2. P / STDEV (P) = a(VOO)/ 0.6STDEV(VOO) + b(VTI)/0.4STDEV(VTI) 

Reddit text editor doesn't support LaTeX, but basically you're just evaluating the left hand side and the denominators, and then doing a substitution."
2021-05-27 00:00:00,stocks,"For larger market ETFs, is there a downside to higher volatility other than the emotional burden? I don’t have the guts for highly speculative plays but I’m trying to be more rational about volatility. The two major risks with high volatility I see are the following:

* For individual stocks, option/leverage plays, actively managed funds, or crazy unpredictable stuff (bitcoin, etc), the risk is it jumping to zero or at least a very low bottom it never gets out of.
* For market-wide index ETFs, it increases the negative swings, so in case of a crash a more volatile fund might drop 60%, a less volatile one only 30%. If you, for whatever reason, need that money in times of a downswing and have to sell, you’re losing out.

The latter, IMO, can be outweighed by even higher upward swings if you’re thinking long-term (10+ years). If we're talking 20 years, the NASDAQ 100 beat the S&P 500, even if you entered at the peak of the dot com bubble. It just took 15 years or so.

I have a concrete example. I’m not from the US, so world-market ETFs are more interesting to me and I’ve been looking at the returns of two specific examples:

iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF USD (Acc)

iShares Edge MSCI World **Momentum Factor** UCITS ETF (Acc)

Both track the MSCI but the latter adds a [momentum factor](https://www.msci.com/eqb/methodology/meth_docs/MSCI_Momentum_Indexes_Methodology_June2017.pdf). That sounds a bit scary to me but the results are [convincing.](https://i.imgur.com/9eJ0lfE.jpg) If I started in 2014, the March 2020 low would still be higher than that of the non-momentum index. [Here’s a chart going all the way back to 2007](https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/904e031c-94e4-4dbc-a314-7c373446dffa) and it doesn’t look bad, either.

I haven’t found charts going further back, so I wonder, for example, what would have happened during the dot com bubble (for reference: The current highest holding in the momentum index is Tesla with a PE ratio of 620). But I don’t see how it would have been drastically different and it would have swung out of dot com shit within 6 months back then.

I’m trying to be careful so: Am I missing something? To me it seems that for *almost* the same risk, I get *much* better returns long term with the momentum factor."
2021-05-27 10:12:03,stocks,"So, there's a common misconception for a number of investors between *risk* and *volatility*. Volatility refers purely to price action - how dispersed prices are around the mean. Volatility really just gives you a frame of reference for the typical distribution profile of some investment. Risk, on the other hand, is the chance that an event has an effect on the investment thesis. This can include known risks (regulatory risk, which materialized with BABA as legal harassment from the CCP) and unknown risks (like with early stage companies, where there is an indefinite number of things that can go wrong leading up to profitability). 

 Not investment advice, but major things I'd look at here in terms of risk: 

1. The distinction between the Momentum Index and the Momentum Tilt index. Make sure you know which one you want - the former is riskier by virtue of being less diversified. 
2. What's in the rest of your portfolio? One thing to be careful of with factor ETFs is that many can have you unknowingly over-exposed to the same particular companies. For instance, if your other holdings (even if ETFs) are heavily weighted to AMZN, TSLA, MSFT and AAPL you're going to be adding idiosyncratic exposure to these companies by virtue of the fact that they are ""high momentum"" currently. Look at the sector/ region exposure while you're at it. 
3. The biggest thing that worries me about this is the ad-hoc rebalancing criteria. The index rebalances twice a year (quite infrequent, in the scheme of things) and has an ad-hoc rebalancing criteria that seeks volatility above the 95th percentile of index history. I would do a little work in a spreadsheet to find out what this means in practice, because you may wind up about 6 months behind major market regime shifts. Try comparing this to other ETFs with similar style tilts while you're at it."

Hey guys! 
Cards on the table, I know very little about the stock market and how it works. I understand the concept of return on investment, capital gains, high risk vs low risk, etc.

I’m just looking for advice on what I should do with the 5k sitting in “cash investments” for my contributory IRA. It used to be a profit sharing account managed by my old company’s accounting firm, but I quit that job and moved across the country. They originally put 1.2k into Vanguard ETFs, right before the pandemic, which have performed extravagantly well in the past year. I think it’s up something like 45%. 

TLDR; I have 5k waiting to be invested in my IRA already, I just don’t know what to do with it. Are the returns on this ETF unprecedented, or would I be wise to buy up a few more shares expecting it to see more lift? 

I’m not trying to become financially independent right now, I just hate to see cash sitting there losing value every month and am not sure how to amend that."

Those are my main holdings and they’re doing great. No huge fluctuations, never a bad time to add in the long term unless WW3/Asteroid, in which case your money isn’t going to save you. 

I have about 10% I play with in individual stocks. If you want to call some long shots, consider doing the same (5-10%). Expect to lose that money, but be pleasantly surprised if you get some baggers out of them. 

Learn how to read a balance sheet, but don’t turn a blind eye to future momentum. The market is illogical sometimes and you can make nice returns out of swing trading catalysts. 

Lastly, when playing individual stocks, you will make mistakes. I’ve been down 90% only to find myself up 4000%. Just don’t put all of your eggs in one basket. Build a nice base of index funds or solid blue chips before you start goofing around.

Don't spend it all at once. Dollar cost average it. Even if you spend $1,000 a month, it's better than all 5K at once.

I had a FOMO, just like you. Dumped my entire Roth into one mutual fund at once to make sure my dollar didn't miss out , I've lost about 25 percent of it over 3 months and am now just slowly watching it crawl back up. If I had put in a chunk each month, I would be in a much better spot. The market is unpredictable, the fear of missing out will fuck you up.

I block out the hedge fund noise and trust my own opinion on it. I could be wrong, but that’s why it only makes up 5% of my portfolio. I think it’ll out perform my VOO though.

# The Balance Sheet

>A  balance sheet shows how much a company is worth, also known as the  ""book"" value. It lists the value of a company's assets, liabilities and  shareholders equity.Like the Income Statement, it is often shared on a quarterly or annual basis.

# Assets

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [**https://imgur.com/3UVsD43**](https://imgur.com/3UVsD43)  
>  
>An **asset** is defined as anything owned by a company that holds inherent, quantifiable value.

**Current assets** include anything a company expects it will convert into cash within a year, such as:

* Cash and cash equivalents
* Prepaid expenses
* Inventory
* Marketable securities
* Accounts receivable

**Noncurrent assets** include long-term investments that aren’t expected to be converted into cash in the short term, such as:

* Land
* Patents
* Trademarks
* Brands
* Goodwill
* Intellectual property
* Equipment used to produce goods or perform services

A **liability** is the opposite of an asset, it's something a company ***owes***.

**Current liabilities** refer to any liability due to the debtor within one year, which may include:

* Payroll expenses
* Rent payments
* Utility payments
* Debt financing
* Accounts payable
* Other accrued expenses

**Noncurrent liabilities** refer to any long-term obligations or debts which will not be due within one year, which might include:

* Leases
* Loans
* Bonds payable
* Provisions for pensions
* Deferred tax liabilities

Liabilities may also include an obligation to provide goods or services in the future.

# Shareholders Equity

**Shareholders' equity** refers to anything that belongs to the owners of a business after any liabilities are accounted for.

* Common stock
* Preferred stock
* Treasury stock
* Retained earnings

If  you were to add up all of the resources a business owns (the  assets)  and subtract all of the claims from third parties (the  liabilities),  the residual leftover is the owners’ equity.

# Dueling Views:

**Record of capital invested:**  There are some who believe that the main function of a balance sheet is  to record how much a business has invested in its assets-in-place,  i.e., the assets that allow for its current operations to occur.

**Measure of current value:**  There is a large and perhaps dominant school of thought among  accountants, or at least accounting rule writers, that a balance sheet  should reflect the value of the business today.

**Liquidation value:**  There is a third school, with lenders to the firm among its primary  members, who feel that a balance should reflect what you would get for  the assets of the firm, if you liquidated them today.

# Fixed and Current Assets

**The Old Way:** Two or three decades ago, the way you were taught to value fixed and current assets was to show them at **original cost, net of accounting depreciation.**

**The New Way:** As accounting has increasingly adopted the **fair value standard**, there has been a move to mark assets to current market value.

**Divergent Effects:** The difference in values that you get for assets, using the two approaches, varies. It is:

* **Greater on older assets than on newer ones**
* **Greater on fixed assets than current assets**

# Financial Assets

* Financial assets can be holdings of securities or part ownership of other companies, private or public.
* With  holdings of publicly traded securities, the movement to using current  market prices to mark up their values is almost complete.
* With equity ownership in other companies, the rules can vary depending on:
   * Whether  the stake is viewed as a majority stake (>50%) or a minority stake.  The former will lead to full consolidation (where 100% of the  subsidiaries revenues and operating income will be included in the  parent company’s financials, with the portion that is not owned shown as  minority or non-controlling interest on the liability side) and with  the latter, the actual stake will be shown as an asset.
   * With  a minority stake, whether it is held for trading or as a long-term  investment. With the former, the holding will be marked to market. With  the latter, it will be shown at book value terms.

# Intangible Assets

**Big game:**  Accountants talk a big game when it comes to intangible assets, and  from that talk, you would think that they have figured out how to value  the big intangibles (brand name, management quality etc.).

**But different reality:**  In reality, accountants are much better at valuing small-bore  intangibles like licenses and customer lists, where the earnings and  cash flows from the intangible are observable and forecastable than they  are at valuing the big intangibles.

# Goodwill

* After  all the talk of intangibles in accounting, it is telling that the bulk  of intangible assets on accounting balance sheets across the world take  the form of one item: **goodwill.**
* Goodwill is a plug variable that signifies little.
   * For goodwill to manifest itself on a balance sheet, a company has to do an **acquisition**.
   * When that **acquisition occurs**, goodwill is measured as the **difference between the price paid on the acquisition and the target company’s asset value (dressed up book value).**
   * It shows up as an asset because **without it in place, balance sheets would not balance.**

# Goodwill Impairment:

**Old rules:**  For much of the last century, goodwill once created in an acquisition,  was written off on autopilot, often amortized over long periods in equal  installments.

**New Rules:** In the late 1990s, both **GAAP** and **IFRS**  rewrote the rules, requiring accountants to revisit goodwill estimates  each year, and make judgments on whether the goodwill had been impaired  or not. To make that judgment, accountants would have to revisit the  target company valuations and decide whether the value had increased (in  which case goodwill would be left unchanged) or decreased (and goodwill  would be impaired).

**Is it informational?**  The rationale for this rule change was to provide information to  markets, but since goodwill impairments are often based upon market  pricing movements (in the sector) and lag them by months and sometimes  years, the effect of goodwill impairments on stock prices has been  negligible.

# Current Liabilities

**Current liabilities can be broadly broken into three groups:**

* **Non-interest-bearing** liabilities, such as accounts payable and supplier credit, which represent part of normal operations.
* **Interest-bearing** short-term borrowings such as commercial paper, short term debt and the short term portion (<1 year) of long term debt.
* **Deferred** salaries, taxes and other amounts due in the short term.

When  computing non-cash working capital, we do not include interest-bearing  short term debt in the calculation, moving it instead into the debt  column.

# Debt Due

When companies borrow money, it can take three forms:

1. **Corporate bonds**, represent debt raised from public markets
2. **Bank loans**, debt raised from banks and other lending institutions
3. **Lease debt**,  arising out of lease contracts requiring lease payments in future  years. Until 2019, only leases classified as capital leases qualified,  but since 2019, operating lease commitments are also debt.

The **mark-to-market movement** on the **asset** side of the balance sheet has been muted on the **liability**  side of the balance sheet. Bank debt, for the most part, is recorded as  originally borrowed, and corporate bonds due, are for the most part not  marked to market.

# Debt details

While  balance sheets are the repositories for total debt due, broken down  into current and long term, there is additional information on debt in  the footnotes, for most companies.

**This additional information can be on three fronts:**

1. Individual debt due, with stated interest rates and maturities.
2. Additional features on the debt, including floating/fixed and straight/convertible provisions.
3. A consolidated table of when debt repayments come due, by year.

# Shareholder’s Equity

**Old ways:**  The shareholders’ equity in a business was a reflection of its entire  history, since it started with the equity brought in to start the  business, adds on equity augmentations over time as well as the  cumulation of retained earnings.

**New ways:** The shareholders’ equity in a business reflects the jumbled mess of mark-to-market accounting, with all of its contradictions."

2021-05-27 08:20:36,stocks,"There's some very good info here, but you haven't explicitly stated the fundamental operation of the balance sheet.  Why is it called that?  The accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Equities.  If you add up everything that belongs in the asset section of the balance sheet the total MUST equal the sum of everything in the liabilities and equities sections.  

If our business is a farm, the assets are the farm land, the barn, the tractors, and the crops.  The liabilities are the mortgage and the workers pay that they earned last week, but the farm has paid yet.  The equity is the cash the farmer used to buy the farm and the profit that the farmer has not paid to himself.  

Under normal circumstances, the crops are sold.  This reduces the crop asset, but increases the cash asset.  Hopefully we sold the crops for more than their value on the balance sheet and turned a profit. That means the cash asset increases more than the crop asset decreases.  The difference is added to retained earnings, which is part of the equities section.  We are still in balance.

 Then, we pay the mortgage and the workers.  The cash asset is reduced and the mortgage and worker pay liabilities are reduced.  Again, we still balance."

2021-05-27 10:05:24,stocks,"Your explanation of intangible assets is too generous - they’re mostly little more than re-packaged goodwill. Recognising internally-generated intangible assets is nigh-impossible, so they only really crop up in M&A. The impairment testing follows a similar logic to goodwill and is vulnerable to similar abuse. Companies carry them unimpaired until they get into trouble, then new management comes in and basically writes them off in full."
2021-05-27 16:09:01,stocks,Commenting as a reminder
2021-05-27 09:55:14,stocks,"I think there is one major flaw that could wrongly influence readers from Prof. Aswath Damodoran's theory.

>Current assets include anything a company expects it will convert into cash within a year  
>  
>Noncurrent assets include long-term investments that aren’t expected to be converted into cash in the short term

This is not true and could make readers believe that are assets will be converted into cash at some point.

Here is the definition of an asset as per IFRS : An asset is a present economic resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events. An economic resource is a right that has the potential to produce economic benefits.

An asset would not necessarily result in cash in the future. It could be traded for another asset. It could simply be useful in order to produce something (e.g. permit for the lumber industry or mining industry). So if you see an entity with 1B of assets, that does not mean that the entity will have 1B of cash in the future."
2021-05-27 10:07:23,stocks,For the fixed assets there isn’t a mechanism to increase them in value. You can only decrease them through impairment (and depreciation). The way you have it worded makes it seem like companies can increase the values now vs the old way. It is important to not get this wrong because it’s one of the easy mistakes to make when looking at a balance sheet. The values recorded can be very understated in comparison to their actual fair value. This gets especially bad if the numbers you are using are net of accumulated depreciation. You could have a building being reported with a net book value of $0 (i.e. it’s fully depreciated) when it’s actually worth tens of millions of dollars.

2021-05-27 08:36:18,stocks,"What happens if there's a flood and crops are ruined?  The crop asset must be decreased. If we decrease assets, we must also decrease either liability or equity.  The mortgage and the workers are not forgiving their debt because of the flood, so the equities must be reduced in the form of decreasing retained earnings.  

When the assets we can sell easily fall below the liabilities that must be paid now, we are bankrupt.  So if there are no crops to sell and no cash in the bank, the farm can't continue to operate.  If the business is bankrupt, all assets are sold off.  Generally, the liabilities are settled first , and the remainder of the assets are distributed to the owners/shareholders.  The bank takes the barn and the land.  The tractors are sold to pay the workers, and the farmer is left with very little.  Our balance sheet now has zero assets, zero liabilities, and zero equity."

2021-05-27 06:20:57,stocks,"I would recommend investing in AEROJET ROCKETDYNE (AJRD). It is a aerospace / military defense rocket provider that is currently in the process of being acquired by Lockheed Martin another big military defense company. In Dec 2020, the proposed sale was announced. In March 2021, the board of AJRD approved the sale and declared a special 5 dollar dividend. All recent actions of the company implies that the sale will be approve. Currently it is being reviewed by pentagon and FTC and the final decision will be announced by the second half of this year. All actions of ARJD over the past few months implies that the sale will be approved by the regulators. I believe the expected price point once the sale becomes final would be in the 70 to 80 range with an upside of up to $200 to $300 base on the current price points of other miliary defense companies like  LMT, NOC, RTX and BAH. Currently the price of the stock is around 48 which is very cheap for a military defense company. It has been consistently profitable and is one of the biggest rocket suppliers of NASA , US Government , Lockheed and Raytheon. Yesterday, I noticed in the time in sale of AJRD that a big investor has been loading up on the stock buying 73,894 shares 5 different times (block trades) with a price point of $48.27.

If we know that its possible, we will start researching them all. So what you want are companies involved in futuristic physics research. Id look at quantum computing companies and anyone capable of creating a behavioral AI (we will likely drop all regulation and moral objections at that point) or who has close ties to government funding like defense contractors.

Forget conventional weapons. Our weapons will be near useless except maybe high powered lasers which are not economical at long range (except in space maybe) and extremely dangerous due to power input/output. 

In terms of weapons, our greatest weapon will be biological. Aliens will likely die if exposed to our biome. They did not evolve around our micro organisms like we did, so odds are, those will either kill them or their micro organisms will kill us or maybe even both. Which basically means they can potentially kill all of us by simply coughing in our air... so lets not piss them off ok? Dont just aim weapons..."

There are transporter shenanigans that theoritical could offer the potential to xerox people but this is mostly handwaved away in the series. There have been duplicates of people and people stuck in transporters on the show.

There are also holodeck shenanigans that might produce an intelligence based on historical/fictional person. That same mechanism could produce a copy of what the computer thinks the person is like.

Really none of the individuals are that important beyond the moral argument that life matters. Some might do scientific work or be trained for something but that doesn't really translate into a monitory value in the federation. At best the person could represent a military or scientific value. Maybe cultural value.

No individual is actually needed to make basic survival happen. Any military person or intern, which is sort of what the redshirt are, would be replaceable. The cost of replacing them would be pretty much non existent given no one gets paid and basic needs are free to everyone. With education people would earn the ability to participate in organisations to do work. That or to die at the hands of some space monster or transporter accident."

No, there’s no real idea how long it’ll take to get out of consolidation if it is that. I remember thinking before that February 25th car crash that enough games had been played for 4k+ to trade soon in SPX and while March wound up being a pretty good month for it, it didn’t happen until April 1st. 

Yes, inflation data will likely cause a reaction. If it’s bad again, even for the same reason it was bad last time, you’ll likely simply see everything thrown away like that time initially. But I don’t know what that has to do with SPX trying to consolidate right now."
2021-05-27 13:27:31,stocks,"I am gonna suggest different from what most people here. It is true that you gotta start somewhere. But investing per 100$ increments is more work than its worth. If i were you id keep money in my bank account until i have 2-3 month worth of emergency fund. Once you have achieved that, then start putting money into investing. Everytime you hit around 1000-2000$ then invest (Buy stocks, ETF, whatever). I always try to invest in brackets between 1000$ and 2000$. When a really good deal shows up (lets say a -5% in the SPY) then ill spend my invest money even if its 1000 or lower).   


And the reason why I ''force'' myself to invest once it reaches 2000 is that if you wait to long for a deal/dip, then you might miss the boat. This strategy has been doing well for me.  


TLDR:  
1. Always have a buffer for emergency that you aren't putting in the market.   
2. Buy within a min/max bracket so that you can more reactively take advantage of dips, while also making sure you don't waste to much time waiting for dips that might not occur."

On the other hand, you could be leaving money on the table by not putting all the money in one stock. I would weigh how bullish you are on each company. Could you live with yourself if the one stock you were high on goes to the moon and you used 60/40? Also, think about the fact that you could be wrong about this company. No matter how much DD a person does, nothing is guaranteed with stocks. I think that may be the key. What’s the more powerful feeling. You being right about the stock and earning a bunch of money? Or would it be being wrong and losing the money? Me? I hate losing more than I enjoy winning."

2021-05-27 11:32:14,stocks,"Think of it this way, say you have a family business like a lemonade stand or a burger shop.  You've considered going public but the complexity and cost of doing that are astronomical. 

Along comes McDonald's.  They're already a public company. They've done all the complex work.  They agree to buy you.  It's a pretty fast and easy acquisition type of transaction, much simpler and quicker than going public yourself.  You go from owning shares of your own private business to owning shares of a public business, without the headache and risk of an IPO.  

Now consider the same scenario, except it's not McDonalds, it's some other company that is public but their main focus so far is just finding some business like yours to acquire.  They're already public, so that part is done. It's just a matter of making sure the have investors with the money and then working out what everyone thinks is an ok price.  

From the retail investor side, they've going tired of IPO's.  They've seen time and again where only ultra rich insiders get a chance to buy them, and even they have no visibility into how much they'll be allocated.  Nobody knows what day it will happen, or even what time when that day is set.  Even up to the last second, nobody knows what price they'll be paying or what the venture they're investing in is even worth.  And what it's worth in the morning can be radically higher or lower later that day.  Owners get their shares locked, only to repeat the craziness when the lockup expires.  It's a blind crapshoot. 

 A spac takes a lot of that nonsense away.  The potential venture is soberly considered over a period of months.  A price and valuation are arrived at in a non-hurried and somewhat sane manner.  The people doing the analysis have somewhat known track records, ranging from Bill Foley down to a Tillman Fertitta.  If the acquisition fails to complete for some reason, everyone gets the original value back."

2021-05-27 10:39:44,stocks,What energy stocks? NEE and DUK are two not green right now.
2021-05-27 11:07:16,stocks,Everyone had a sell order of SPY at $420.69
2021-05-27 10:58:05,stocks,maybe people (whales) not wanting to hold shares over 3 day weekend. Personally expecting a mildly red friday.
2021-05-27 10:57:53,stocks,"Back in 2016 I bought a 1000 shares of AMC for $35/share.  I don't want to lose any money on them so I'm going to offer them to you for the same price I bought them.  Win-win, no?"
2021-05-27 10:55:33,stocks,"You don't.  Only the options buyer can exercise a contract.  And 99.99% would be stupid to exercise a contract well before the expiration date.  Unless you buy another contract to close the one you sold, you're stuck until 6/18.  Don't worry, though, a lot can happen between now and then.  I'd be very surprised if AMC stays above your strike."
2021-05-27 11:02:17,stocks,Was smart to do covered calls I thought they would be in so much debt by now but I guess the wallstreetbets move basically bailed them out.
2021-05-27 10:54:49,stocks,Buy back the call that you sold and sell your stock at market value. They would not accept the deal you proposed because they lose out on all the extrinsic value in the call option.
2021-05-27 10:56:59,stocks,">How do I offer my shares to a call buyer?

the buyer has to choose to exercise. 

>But I just don’t want to wait till 6/18

what difference does it make. Just imagine mentally that you sold your shares at 20, locking in profits, and they're no longer yours."
2021-05-27 12:26:25,stocks,Cut your losses and invest in something that will provide a return in this market.

2021-05-27 14:02:59,stocks,"Eh, the amount of shares flying around (volume) this isn’t retail alone.  There are bigger players in it too."
2021-05-27 14:05:32,stocks,Retail doesn't move billions in a stock.

2021-05-27 15:46:05,stocks,"I don't understand when people ask about stocks based on share price. A company could reverse split and its $25 stock would suddenly be a $50 stock without changing the value of the company at all. Do you actually only have $25? If that's the case, spend it on beans and rice, not a single share of a company whose stock is trading below $25."

2021-05-27 16:17:52,stocks,It's a little absurd how the price in 15 minutes of afterhours has moved about as much as it did for the entire market session.
2021-05-27 16:28:25,stocks,"Nope, the VIX isn't matching up with what happened in late January.

I find what happened to Google late interesting but the real story of this sleepy tape is there was fairly heavy, heavy duty futures selling. It is surprising that SPX managed to hang on and not go negative...it was negative the last time that this was noticeable (but not by much, which ended up becoming foreshadowing to April).

TSLA isn't shorted that much anymore FWIW to the other poster. That could easily have been a gamma squeeze instead, which is tough to orchestrate now with it in the S&P but it has happened at times."
2021-05-27 16:21:26,stocks,"That would be my guess. Someone is liquidating. GOOG got hit hard, Apple a little. Shorted companies shot up, including TSLA and NKLA. Whoever shorted those also must have shorted FB because it shot up too."
2021-05-27 15:50:53,stocks,"It's ridiculous. What ""recovery"" could possibly justify the stock being valued 4x what it was worth before the pandemic? Let's imagine that Covid is utterly driven into extinction overnight tonight. Is there anything about AMC's operation that would make it 4x more profitable than it was in January of last year?"
2021-05-27 13:15:14,stocks,"When a stock is so detached from fundamentals and manipulated by institutions, it's unwise to take any gambles on it. You can cut your losses and re-short again at a higher price to bet that it must eventually align with its fundamentals. I suspect we are close to the inevitable rug pull, but it's just not within my risk appetite to take any positions on it."
2021-05-27 13:21:04,stocks,"You're insane. Good luck, though."
2021-05-27 13:18:52,stocks,"Brave to short it, I rather play puts..."
2021-05-27 13:50:03,stocks,It’s probably gonna hit 30 today. Based on Ortex data the squeeze hasn’t even really started yet. This is just FOMO prior to the squeeze.
2021-05-27 14:09:44,stocks,"Which price did you short it on? Get out of it now. You shouldn't be messing with meme stocks like AMC, GME, UWMC, RKT, and many others."
2021-05-27 15:43:40,stocks,"I'm rather in the other meme OG stock, but in the future do not believe official shorted SI because those are easily cooked, to be sure check if stock was shorted a lot in the past and also have a massive Failure to Deliver history. It may be a sign that a past shorts were ""closed"" with strategic failure to deliver and it may rise with no ""reason"" in the future. At least this is a theory from ""cultists"" sub."
2021-05-27 13:14:08,stocks,Short % reported is probably not accurate
2021-05-27 15:36:24,stocks,Indexing investing will beat active investing 7.8 times out of 10. It's a smart move.
2021-05-27 13:59:28,stocks,Could be people turning a three day weekend into a five day weekend. We could all use a break.
2021-05-27 11:20:14,stocks,Lately Fridays have been ripping but after a good week like this and going into a long weekend I really hope we dont just get a fat Friday dump
2021-05-27 14:02:36,stocks,"It’s not, just short sellers getting destroyed by by retailers. Funny as hell to see.

Imagine going to Harvard or an Ivy League school losing your entire hedge fund or losing an entire investment portfolio to dumb money.

No skin in the game but things will get back to normal. I’d say the easy money of these idiots shorting everything with tons of cash is long gone

The only thing I’d say that’s annoying from all this is everyone thinking a stock price that’s low is inevitably going to short squeeze, and trying to pump and dump the next dumb thing"
2021-05-27 17:23:06,stocks,"Been in since the $40s, but I sold a few days ago. It's gotten way to high, and the higher it goes, the bigger the correction will be, in my opinion."

2021-05-27 13:40:47,stocks,Thanks for the heads up 👍
2021-05-27 13:29:34,stocks,When will the CPI be released?
2021-05-27 13:27:25,stocks,"Yep, although I don’t believe it’ll be long lasting I think the comps are gonna spook the market bad. Holding onto a lot of cash to buy my conviction companies. Bought some VIX calls too"
2021-05-27 07:37:43,stocks,"maybe it runs up until June 10th as CPI data is released. Then, it will move depending on month-on-month inflation."
2021-05-27 08:31:39,stocks,"I took a position in GDXJ, therefore it will fall"
2021-05-27 13:51:55,stocks,No one knows. If you start throwing out price targets you know people will sell way before it.
2021-05-27 13:51:49,stocks,It’s quite amazing since they have been printing stock non stop. Even that couldn’t stop the surge.

""at 50""

Oh boy"
2021-05-27 15:11:58,stocks,It could irrationally shoot up to 60 and you get margin called.

2021-05-27 11:24:02,stocks,"It feels like this earning seasons has been weird for a ton of companies. At least in tech, companies would beat earnings and stock would trader lower the next day."

2021-05-27 11:54:42,stocks,I would DCA the 80k weekly for 6 months into QQQ. All of it.
2021-05-27 12:36:33,stocks,Get VT 100% & let it ride for years.
2021-05-27 12:07:00,stocks,Definitely some VTI-like index fund.

2021-05-27 12:18:40,stocks,"You might have delayed data. If you're buying at the bid, you're not guaranteed to have your order filled, but if you're buying the ask, you probably have delayed data. Try tradingview and compare the numbers. They seem to have accurate bid/ask data for high liquidity stocks"
2021-05-27 12:56:50,stocks,"I’ve found Google Sheets to be better just for tracking simple stuff like latest price, % change since previous close, then an add-on called GainFactor for stuff like beta and RSI. What kind of data are you looking to import?"
2021-05-27 13:22:22,stocks,"A world tracker is likely to stay within a +/- 2% range short term you're desperate to have it invested in something low risk.

Any individual stock is a crapshoot."
2021-05-27 13:54:05,stocks,"Did the same thing, cashed out and will stay out til mid week. Holding on to my conviction plays, this kinda shit is to scary. Nearly everything in looking at is coming up so quickly. Not a fan."
2021-05-27 14:01:19,stocks,I don't believe HD is going to benefit from industrial supplies shortages. They will have a harder time to restock (longueur lead time by factories) and will have to increase prices (which doesn't mean they will make more profit). If anything you'd want the companies who are the suppliers of HD.
2021-05-27 13:49:22,stocks,"I also bought it recently.

If you're swing trading, you might want to take profits at some point given the way all semis have been behaving for months, but I'm willing to sit it out."
2021-05-27 14:04:31,stocks,Not all my stocks are green🥲

2021-05-27 10:58:55,stocks,"Agreed. As someone called out, last time I think it touched like 25 dollars, so there will be probably resistance around this number. I would probably put a stop loss at like 22 at this point and call it a day."
2021-05-27 11:02:03,stocks,Thanks. I thought the same and exited. Pretty sure it was a good move. Time will tell
2021-05-27 11:02:40,stocks,Bought in intervals with an avg price about 10. So decent trade I’d say! Exited now

2021-05-27 12:42:44,stocks,What's your expire date? Mine 6/18 and I'm hurting right now. Thinking of averaging down
2021-05-27 15:49:22,stocks,Appreciate the reassurance man. Ultimately I know that and dont really regret my decision because I'm in this for the long game as opposed to the quick buck. But in the moment its certainly hard not to kick ones self
2021-05-27 15:46:18,stocks,"Yeah you’re definitely right. I honestly would like to think I would’ve exited before today anyway after the rally of the past few days. But for all I know, the greed could’ve taken over and I wouldve rode this thing all the way up then back down. Still stand by my choice considering I have a long time horizon but damn.... Hard not to kick yourself in the moment seeing a 40%+ day lmao"
2021-05-27 17:18:31,stocks,"This is why I am not touching GME and AMC this time and keeping my fun, young person speculation restricted to the digital cash.

I have had sweet, *unrealized* gains with those tickers plenty of times. But every single time, even if I didn't screw up and panic sell on a dip, I still let loads of unrealized gains slip through my fingers. There's reason why not everyone gets rich left and right even when so many stocks rocket all the time. Everyone holding gets to experience the juicy unrealized gains, but only a fraction of folks actually realize notable gains. The peak never lasts and it often doesn't take long to go from being rich to bleeding cash. I like the digital cash because while it's a lot more volatile, I have faith in it rising overall in the future so it's fine for me to not constantly watch it. With these stocks, anything can happen and their price isn't being driven by long term fundamentals (for the most part) but pressure against shorting. It's not something I personally can feel comfortable just casually checking now and then."
2021-05-27 11:41:22,stocks,Because i wanted to hold it (this time) long term. Like a decade babyy

Like, yeah, maybe they are good products for some people but if someone wants a leveraged ETF in the defense industry, the comparison isn't a nonleveraged etf with different holdings and a low budget manager.

2021-05-27 13:57:23,stocks,If it were me i'd sell shares on the way up. Like say I have 50 shares. Sell 10 now. Sell 10 at 29. Sell 10 at 30. Sell 10 at 32 and then have a higher number in mind for last 10. If it doesn't hit that number have a trailing stop loss. Because while it can keep going higher there is still huge downside risk that as soon as it turns red people head for exits.

Options: 100,000 - vested over 3 years, 1/3 over 1 year, then the remaining on a monthly 
vesting schedule, subject to Board approval

Can somebody explain ( in lay terms ) what this statement implies, what Options are and how they differ from Stocks. 

Has anyone experienced a similar situation and can share advice on how to manage Options provided from an employer.

Thanks in advance"
2021-05-27 05:49:10,stocks,"I can probably answer this as I’ve founder a couple of startups.

1) This isn’t like options in regard to option trading. This is more then likely the option to buy the shares at 0.001cent for something similar. EG a very small amount for accounting reason. But you have to read the fine print.

2) for the vesting. If you leave before 1 year you get 0 shares, then after 1 year 1/3 of your shares and then more every month until at the end of year 3 you have all your shares. This is a very standard practice as you what you to stay.

You basically have nothing really to loss and this a standard contract. But what you need to find out is how many outstanding shares are they and what % does this mean. Could be 1% of the company or 0.0001%"
2021-05-27 05:06:47,stocks,Basically a Option is a certificate to buy shares at a specified price. Vested means that after 3 years 100% of the options belong to you and after 1 year 1/3 of the options belong to you. Pls take this with a grain of salt and correct me if im wrong English is not my first language.
2021-05-27 05:54:39,stocks,"Option is a contract between you and in this case company that gives you the right but not obligation to buy company stocks at predetermine price, so you can buy stocks if you want or you can sell options to someone else or leave them to expire worthless.          
      
It is popular today for start ups to give options for attracting workers, many startups fails in their business, so options are worthless, but in case that companies succeeds you can have a lot of shares.     
    
So based on what you have written, you will get in one year 1/3 of the proposed 100,000, and the rest would get only if board approve them, and are issued on a monthly basis.    
     
Now, you could ask for stock option agreement (grant) to check more details (ISO or NSO), strike price (buying price of share), expiration date and other possible clauses in grant."

Depending on how small the startup is, strike price may be substantial. And if you quit or get fired they typically expire quickly afterward, so be aware that you might need to make a decision to pony up cash to own the stock or just let them expire."

2021-05-27 12:44:29,stocks,"Would it be likely that the board wouldn't approve of the options count if the stock was to rise? Is this a technique for them to cover themselves? 

I will ask for the agreement upon starting as that's when they provide the official options contract.

Are there any areas of the contract you would recommend paying close attention to?"
2021-05-27 13:21:04,stocks,no the option price to buy the shares at a set price never change. normally for a startup the strike price is normally very small.  but this all depends on the contract and wording.

2021-05-27 05:48:16,stocks,"I don’t think so, it’s pretty standard. Yours is actually more generous then mine - I have to wait 4 instead of 3 years. 

Worth checking what can exclude you from executing the options. The contract might make reference to “good” and “bad” leavers, check what makes you bad so you can’t execute - should be standard stuff like dismissal which anyone expects but possibly there’s some curveballs.

Price is important just for understanding if you could execute. It’s rare to have too many options that you can’t afford, but if it’s say 100k options at 0.80, no way I’d be able to action all of them."

2021-05-27 05:59:27,stocks,"Would the expiration date be after the vested period is over? Can they still be executed after that date?

I'll have to do some digging to see what the price is worth. 

It's probably best I don't share the name of the company just yet, as I've not even signed the contract.

But, I can guarantee you wouldn't know them, extremely small start up (7 employees) still in very early stages."

Adding pretend value figure, you have the Option to buy 100,000 shares at 0.10 cents/pence. So for 10,000 of your money, you could action the Option and buy all of them in 3 years time. As has happened in my case, if you have another funding round, the stock might go up in value before you use the Option, so basically the stock might now be worth 0.50 each but you still can buy them for 0.10 if you choose to, betting a nice value increase. 

Obviously this means only use the Option if it’s a good company and you anticipate the future value of the stock will be higher"

2021-05-27 00:00:00,stocks,"Tecnoglass (TGLS) - the best stock possibly of 2021 Tecnoglass Inc., through its subsidiaries, manufactures, supplies, and installs architectural glass, windows, and associated aluminum products for the commercial and residential construction industries in North, Central, and South America. 

In the last month it is up 55%, 6 months 220% and for the year 423%.

It has a Div Rate of $.11, current price at 19.73 and most recently beat it's EPS by $.13 and it's revenue by $12.51 on May 7th.

There are so many great factors that continue to help it's case. Housing market is red hot, analyst consensus currently has them earning $1.02 this year in EPS and by 2023 at $1.50.

While lumber gets most of the talk on shortages, windows and doors are second. For its most recent quarter, its gross margins surged more than 700 basis points. That's nearly unheard of for an industrial company.

On a more personal note, as someone with a connection to Miami, TGLS produces by far the most superior product the the PGT and CGI glass found elsewhere. It is THE top of the line glass and if it can handle the Hurricane season in Miami, it can absolutely expand evenmoreso in future years.

As one person wrote, "" I tell anyone that I meet on social media or around Brickell, to consider living only in a building that has TGLS glass.""

The company even today is STILL undervalued and is rarely if ever mentioned in the mainstream or major investment websites. NOW is the best time to jump in and take advantage on a nice dip (such as today when it was down 3%) while there is still time. 

(Note: I own shares of TGLS)"
2021-05-27 05:03:20,stocks,"I might be alone in this but personally I would never invest in a company that has just 4X’d in a year unless it’s some sort of short term swing play to cash in on volatility or something...like where’s the room for growth? It’s a glass company, not some revolutionary new tech that’ll change the world. 

Ok cool, it’s beating earnings, yadda yadda, but why would it go up another 10% even? I’m not saying it won’t, I just see no justification for why this good performance isn’t already priced in.

Really not trying to be super critical here, but c’mon, seriously? A 3% dip is a buying opportunity, but a 400+% increase YOY and it still has room to grow? Idk am I missing something?

2021-05-27 00:00:00,stocks,"Investing Questions Hello,

Like most reddit sheeple I invested in AMC when the stonks short stuff was happening, and I had a few questions about investing in general.  Disclaimer, I also did this with no guidance or general knowledge, so I'm also still relatively clueless of the ins and outs.

I understand if I were to sell stocks within a year of me buying I will be taxed, but if I were to sell it and reinvest into another company would I still be taxed?

And If I were to make a Roth IRA account, would stocks I own be able to be in that account?

I did all of this investing through Vanguard which was told to me is a good option for investing.  And I understand that through vanguard there are a few options of how you invest through a roth ira.

Last question, I recently got a 401k with my new job and I understand that you can fund a roth IRA with a 401k, but how quickly can that happen? I don't know alot about 401ks, but I imagine they take a portion from each check to go towards retirement, and just curious if I can on a monthly basis use that to fund a roth?

Thank you, also I just want to repeat I have pretty limited knowledge on how this stuff works and I appreciate any and all help!"
2021-05-27 03:38:57,stocks,"Hey! Let me try and answer some of your questions - 
1. AMC - hey, a lot of people got in on investing with GME and AMC, so don’t sweat it. However know that those are very rare events and are not likely to happen again. Your learning should be that don’t invest in hype / meme stocks. Start with ETFs (VTI, QQQ etc.). Invest in companies that you believe in. This has been repeated multiple times - Time in the Market beats Timing the Market. What that means is that play the long game, hold stocks long term and react based on how those companies are performing. 

2. Taxes / Short term vs. Long term gains - Any profit you realize will be taxed. So if you buy a stock and sell for profit - the profit is taxed. How much it is taxed depends on how long you have held your position. If you hold for longer than a year, you fall into long term capital gains tax, which is lower than short term capital gains which is taxed as ordinary income. The profit will be taxable irrespective. Even if you invest it somewhere else, you are taxed on the profit you made from the sale.

3. 401K and Roth IRA are tax advantaged retirement schemes. You can’t transfer stocks from your brokerage to your retirement fund. However, you can use your 401K/IRA funds to invest in different portfolios. I would suggest not to gamble with your retirement money. Choose a risk profile depending on your age / appetite and let that money compound and grow. Use extra money to invest in individual stocks. 

4. You will have a different account for each service - A Vanguard Brokerage account, a Roth IRA account, 401K etc. They are different from each other and not part of the same pool of money. 

5. I am not sure about funding a Roth IRA using 401K. They are quite different. For your 401K, you are deducted pre tax, but are taxed when you get the money back at retirement. For Roth IRA - you contribute post tax money, however, when you withdraw at retirement, you don’t pay any tax. 

There are lots of articles out there that go into the basics of your question. Take some time to read up on those. Hope this helps."
2021-05-27 05:42:44,stocks,Yes. As soon as you click that sell button (assuming you sold at a gain) you trigger a taxable event.
2021-05-27 07:08:28,stocks,"Yes you would still be taxed if you sold at a profit and used the proceeds to purchase another stock

You can invest in anything you want inside of an IRA

You dont use a 401k to fund an IRA, a 401k is like it's own separate IRA except that it must be funded through money taken directly out of your paycheck, your investment options are limited to what the 401k provider allows, and you can contribute up to $19,500/yr."

2021-05-27 07:53:38,stocks,"Getting bumped into a new bracket isn’t how that works. Your first $10k or so will always be taxed the same amount. Then the next level and so on.

I see from other comments that you're with Fidelity, if you're not too attached to using ETFs specifically, consider Fidelity's zero cost index funds, 70% FZROX and 30% FZILX it roughly the same as the previous ETFs but have no expense ratio."

Bezos was asked whether Amazon will have any trouble innovating now that it has grown so large and diversified. He acknowledged that Amazon under its new leader Jassy will have to manage newer bets that have no guarantee of being successful, including its Amazon Care telehealth service and Project Kuiper satellite internet network.

“Let me assure you, I can guarantee you that none of these ideas are guaranteed to work,” Bezos said. “All of them are gigantic investments and they’re all risks...The only way to get above-average returns is to take risks and many won’t pay off. Our whole history as a company is about taking risks, many of which have failed and many of which will fail, but we’ll continue to take big risks.”

2021-05-27 11:52:42,stocks,"I bought back into a double-sized position of Amazon on the first dip after Jassy was named the successor.  

Bezos, for all the hype he gets, has been largely disengaged from Amazon the company for many years now.  Long story short, used to be heavily involved with an Amazon-related business many, many years ago.  Significant enough to be dealing with the ring around Bezos himself.  Noticed a huge change in what had been a constructive relationship.  He became a figure in name only.  Can't blame him, as I'd also check out too, and at much lower levels of personal wealth.  The point here is that losing Bezos isn't really the loss the media made it out to be.  He's been gone for a long time.

Second is that I've observed in a lot of highly successful enterprises, there's some unheralded person or people that have and drive the most awesome ideas, if the leadership allows.  The point here is that most of the brilliant strategies and execution of the last couple decades, that behind the scenes genius has been Jassy.  And again, contrary to initial media reports, him being named was very good news, not bad or unknowable.

* Something you'd be willing to hold onto for years assuming nothing major changes with the company, even if the price tanked 30% or more, because you know it'll go back up soon enough.

* Typically a company you are willing to familiarize your self with quite closely so you can tell exactly when you might need to exit or perhaps double down on.
* When you start the wheel, the IV percentile should be relatively high (30 or so on the low end, though some won't sell unless it's 50+ or even 70+). This will help with premiums.

2021-05-27 00:00:00,stocks,"$SNOW SNOWFLAKE hits estimate on earnings. Guidance calls for decline in product revenue Snowflake stock fell as much as 7% then rebounded in extended trading on Wednesday after the data analytics software company gave full-year guidance that met but did not exceed analysts’ estimates. 

**Here’s how the company did:**

Earnings: Loss of 70 cents per share
Revenue: $190.5 million, vs. $178.5 million as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.
The company’s revenue increased by 117% on an annualized basis in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Jan. 31, according to a statement. In the prior quarter had grown 119%. The company’s net loss widened to about $199 million from $83 million in the year-ago quarter.

“We have implemented operations that will help us show more profitability,” finance chief Mike Scarpelli said during a conference call with analysts. “We’re continuing to invest heavily in the business.”

The company also said in a regulatory filing that as of Monday it had gotten rid of its dual-class structure, in which Class A shares got one vote per share and Class B shares got 10 votes per share. The structure had been in place since September, when Snowflake stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. Now, all Class B shares will be converted into Class A shares.

With respect to guidance, Snowflake said it expects $195 million to $200 million in product revenue in the fiscal first quarter, which would be up 92% to 96% year over year. Analysts polled by FactSet were looking for $196.3 million in product revenue. Almost 94% of Snowflake’s revenue came from product revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter.

For the full 2022 fiscal year, the company sees $1.00 billion to $1.02 billion in product revenue, representing 81% to 84% growth, a decline from 116% product revenue growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected $1.01 billion in product revenue.

$SNOW fell 3.08% after-market close today to $228.00

It won't be long until snow's revenue is higher than PLTR. Snow's sector though is expanding very rapidly and their product is completely superior to the competition.

PLTR on the other hand is an uncertainty and hard to valuate. Even their sector is hard to valuate and estimate it's growth.

2021-05-27 00:00:00,stocks,"Why, exactly, are stocks valuable? I'm deeply confused as to why stocks are valuable and I seem to have difficulty explaining my confusion, so I'd like to give an example.

Storytime:
I, big kid on the cul-de-sac, decide to open a lemonade stand and I begin to turn a profit. Some neighborhood kids want in so I take some ""magic"" rocks and sell them to neighborhood kids at $1 per rock (lets call these kids Group 1 and say these rocks can't be counterfeited or something). I tell them that each magic rock represents just a tiny bit of ownership in my lemonade stand, and that there won't be any more magic rocks in the future.

Business get even better- I keep raising the prices and people continue to wait in line for my lemonade. The company puts the money in the bank account to save up for a future lemonade stand. Other kids who don't have any magic rocks (let's cleverly call them Group 2), fear they're missing out and want buy magic rocks from the Group 1, who now refuse to sell the for $1.

Group 1: ""It was worth $1 a few days ago, sure. But do you see how successful the lemonade stand has become? The business is worth more now, meaning the magic rocks are worth more now. We'll sell them for $2.""
Group 2: ""That makes sense. Here's some money my mom's boyfriend gave me as allowance""

This continues for a few weeks- business keeps getting better, I put up a second lemonade stand, and the value of the magic rocks goes up accordingly, now going for $10 each. Pretty much everyone has ""made money"" off the magic rocks.

Some kid from r/iamverysmart asks Group 1, the professionals, some questions.

iamverysmart: ""Why are the rocks worth $10?""
A: That's the market price- supply and demand

Q: ""How could I make money on this?""
A: The price could go up in the future and you could sell for a profit

Q: ""What would make the price go up?
A: The company does well- You see there are equations for the ""natural"" price of magic rocks. These involve several variables: income, expected growth.. very complicated stuff. But magic rocks are going for less than their current ""natural"" price based on these equations. So it's a great time to buy

Q: ""Why would that make the price of magic rocks go up?""
A: Because when you own a magic rock you own part of the lemonade stand. That means its money in the bank, its lemonade, the materials that make up the stand, everything.

Q: ""But how could I get money on that?""
A: Like I said, by selling when the price increases. I understand, it's kind of confusing, but trust we've been doing this for a while and even made some money on it.

-------------End Story-------------

Lets compare the above lemonade stand to a company that doesn't pay dividends. How are they different?

edit: I guess I asking what the ""inherent"" value of a stock is. It's different from money, which is only valuable because people think it's valuable, right?"
2021-05-26 22:04:46,stocks,"I'm confused by your confusion.

Your question is, how can a company that doesn't pay dividends have value? Or how do any stocks have values?"
2021-05-26 22:30:56,stocks,"Because they take my money.  I invest, then they go down.  therefore, they must have lots of money"
2021-05-26 22:05:05,stocks,"I think you missed one step. When you sold your magic rocks  at first...THAT money goes into the business as an investment.

Also, a wise lemonade stand operator might hold onto a few magic rocks to serve as an incentive to future employees or to raise more cash."
2021-05-26 22:06:29,stocks,Why is money valuable?
2021-05-26 22:33:22,stocks,"Stocks are valuable because, as you already identified, it makes you a literal owner of said company that has intrinsic value.  Let's carry your example out with a non-dividend paying company.

The initial offering of stocks trades a piece of the company for money that the company can use to grow, improve, expand, etc.

The *Book Value*, or equity, of your lemonade stand company starts out as the accumulated value of the equipment and inventories (stand, pitchers, cups, lemons, etc) minus the liabilities (bills, loans, expenses, payroll, etc).  Let's say for simplicity that you bought all of your equipment outright, with one stand you pay yourself 50% of the net profits, and you pay cash for all supplies.  Additionally, you have 50% of your money profits as the *Free Cash Flow*, which you are putting away in the bank for now.  The Book Value and Free Cash Flow give the company tangible value.

If you sold everything off, then that money would get divided up between the owners.  This is what we are buying with our stock at $1/share.

The company's revenue grows.  As a result free cash flow grows more, making the company more valuable.  People are willing to pay up to $5/share.

Now, you take some of that free cash flow that you've been saving up in the bank and expand to 2 stands.  The company's *book value* grows, as does its total incoming revenue.  Free cash flow growth goes up as a result of this revenue growth.  All of this equity and free cash flow makes the company more valuable.  People are willing to pay more because it's literally worth more.

They also see that you are growing and you announce plans to open 3 more stand in the next 2 years.  Now people are willing to buy some of the company for even more money, $10/share, because the company's equity and free cash flow are growing and this expansion should mean more value.

Finally, after 20 years the hot dog stand company decides to offer to buy the entire company, and the board (you in this example) think it's a good idea.  You get approval from your shareholders to proceed with the sale.  That buyout gets divided out between owners, you and the shareholders.

The shareholders that bought at $1, $5, and $10 are likely going to make a tidy profit after 20 years."
2021-05-26 23:22:43,stocks,"You understand that if you own all of the stock of a given company, you own the company. 

So in your lemonade stand hypo. If u sold ten shares, at $1 each, the total value of lemon stand is $10. That could be based on the sales the lemon stand has, along with any physical goods the stand owns, like property or the land it self.

So if people think the lemonade stand is worth $15 in total from sales and property, they would be willing to pay up to 1.50 a share. 

Does this make sense?"
2021-05-26 23:26:01,stocks,"theoretically, u can have a great business with lots of consumer demand for its products but low demand for its stocks"
2021-05-27 01:05:19,stocks,"Think of it this way. Stock is ownership. 

You have a lemonade stand. It’s a successful one, as far as neighborhood lemonade stands go. You own 100%, which means that you own 100% of the equity. In the beginning, let’s say you could sell your family lemonade recipe for $100, you own some equipment worth a few grand, and you pull in a couple thousand every quarter. You want to expand, but that requires funding. You need a million dollars to buy the equipment, pay employees, purchase real estate for your stores, etc. But what do you have to offer someone who can give you that funding? 

You can offer investors $1 for every lemonade sold. That’s a royalty deal. Or you can offer them a percentage of your company. Let’s say you convince two investors your lemonade business will be a huge success. They agree to pony up $500,000 each for 25% of your company. In real life, they’d probably want riders attached to that money to reduce their risk, and board seats, but let’s keep it simple. Right now, by investing that money, they’re saying your company is worth $2,000,000 if you sold the company—yes the entire company—to a willing buyer (actually, they’re hoping someone will pay a lot more). That’s right—when someone wants to buy your lemonade company, you’re not handing them bags of lemons when they write you a check. What you hand them is your company stock. (Better be some good lemonade!)

Now you all could be wrong. The lemonade company can fail and be worth zero. No one would want to buy it. 

On the flip side though, If your lemonade is a big success, people will want to buy your company for considerably more than $2,000,000. Heck, you might earn $2,000,000 just in lemonade sales a year, in addition to the value of your equipment and real estate. Now, you could take an offer from the private equity firm that wants to give you $5,000,000 to walk away, but your original investors think people will pay a whole lot more. That’s when these investors say, hey man, you should IPO, raise more money for growth (and for our profitable exit). 

Lemonade is hot right now. So everyone wants in. The IPO values you at $20,000,000, based on your book value, your earnings, and what some folks think you can pull in over the next few years. If someone wants to come along and buy your company outright (all its stock), that’s what they’ll need to pay. Suddenly, the stock held by your original investors (assuming no dilution, keeping it simple) is worth $5,000,000. They can sell off some equity and make a nice profit. 

Those who buy in at the IPO price are making the same calculation those original investors did. That your company will grow and become more valuable to those who want to buy or control it. For a retail investor buying a small amount of stock, they’ll never get a board seat, they’ll never have a prayer of owning a significant part of the company and exerting control... but the whales, the institutional investors and large investment banks absolutely will. They’ll be paying more per share for the privilege of controlling the company via board seats or activism, and may even bid to takeover the company outright. In the belief that they can drive even more growth and value, and make your lemonade company even more valuable to future buyers. 

When you finally sell to PepsiCo for $40,000,000, the stock those IPO holders bought is worth double. The stock those original investors held? Well, let’s just say they cash out feeling very happy for themselves. 

Upon the sale of the company, there can be a few different outcomes for investors, but a cash for stock deal is one that might make the most sense to you. In that scenario, you get paid based on that $40,000,000 valuation. If you bought in much lower, you made a nice profit. 

Good example is LEAF. Worth $1 a share a year ago when the company was valued at around $37,000,000. Now the company sold to another company for $323 million. Shareholders will get $8.50 a share in cold hard cash. The company that bought LEAF isn’t paying $8.50 for air, they’re buying a company. Stock is the way the ownership transfers. 

To you, a Redditor who likely does not have a ton of equity in any company, of course stock seems inherently worthless. You will never own the company. You will never control it. You will never sell it or merge it or spin-off it’s parts or do anything to change the company’s value at all. But people far more wealthy and powerful than you will. And their intention is to always drive the fundamentals of a company to become more valuable so that part or all of it can be sold for more money. The democratic thing about stock investing is that whatever price they sell to each other for, that’s the price you can sell your stock for too.

Of course there are pumps and dumps, situations where stock values are inflated, wildly divorced from fundamentals and there’s no way the company will ever sell (or raise funds) at that price. In these cases, it’s really just gambling. But valuations tend to revert to a mean over time and represent true value. If you own stocks that are insanely overvalued (you know the ones), ideally you get out before the music stops.

In short, stock has value because it really does represent ownership. The profits a company makes that aren’t paid out in dividends are retained or reinvested in the company, and if handled responsibly, the company becomes more attractive to those who would want to buy it outright or own enough to exert influence. Ownership is power. Not for you, gentle Redditor, but for those at the top that trade the stock, it absolutely is. You just get to benefit by the money they’re willing to pay."
2021-05-26 21:51:10,stocks,"You know that companies are buying stock back to raise the price, right?"
2021-05-26 23:42:48,stocks,"Shhhhh... it’s all the greater fools theory, all of it."
2021-05-26 22:50:58,stocks,"Let’s say the company never pays dividends and the stock price keeps dropping based on this. The company would do stock buy backs until there’s barely any outstanding stock or they go private. So the arbitrage opportunity of a valuable business keeps the stock price rising. If a business is mad cheap it will be bought out or go private and the sole owners of the shares can force a dividend. Let’s say Facebook never pays a dividend and the market cap (just a thought experiment) goes down to 2k. You could buy all existing shares and then force the company to pay you a dividend from the net income. So you’d basically get millions of dollars in dividend per year for a 2k purchase. 

That’s why the stock rises. To avoid arbitrage of this manner."
2021-05-26 22:00:15,stocks,Stocks are just legitimized ponzi schemes.
2021-05-26 22:39:03,stocks,"You seem to be forgetting or maybe you don't know, the only reason for a company to go public is to raise money so they can grow their business. The shares start at X price and the company gets all that cash from selling the initial shares(the company keeps a large portion of course)"
2021-05-27 01:31:33,stocks,"Why does a business have value? Generally speaking because it has assets and because it uses those assets to create value in the future. The more assets it has and the more value it is going to create, the more overall value it has. A successful business will grow it’s value over time, even by simply using the same assets over and over to create more goods or services. 
That is in general terms called intrinsic value. If you own stock in this company, you own a piece of that business. If you want to convert the value of that share into money ( I.e a currency system to store and transfer value that you can use in exchange for goods and services) you have to sell it to someone in exchange for said money. To do that, you have to agree with the buyer on a price, that is then paid. Markets are very effective in assessing the price of something( but not perfect). That’s why we use those for it. The general theory is, that the market will, over time, price any asset according to it‘s current value. (It does not actually do that in many cases, for a variety of reasons, but that’s a different story) So in a way, a share is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it at any given time, this should, but doesn’t have to reflect the intrinsic value of the company it represents."
2021-05-27 02:02:00,stocks,This is one of the first things they teach you when you get a finance degree. The value of a stock is based on the present value of expected future cash flows. A stock that doesn’t pay dividends now has a value because there is an expectation that they will pay dividends in the future.
2021-05-27 03:51:24,stocks,"If it doesn't pay dividends, you expect the stock price to go up. If it is paying high dividends, then you expect the price to stay same.

2021-05-27 04:27:39,stocks,"Stocks work like money and money works like products. Value is based on supply and demand, as well as the believe of value.

Take diamonds. Still the most expensive, still easy to mine, had no freaking value 100 years ago, but marriage rings and jewelry became a thing.

Stocks are a leveraged concept of this but it's just like removed or anything else you buy just for the sake of value. You hope that the pattern continues and people keeping up the thought that Stocks have value. If that keeps going the prices will change, that could be increase or decrease since every seller needs a buyer and every buyer needs a seller.

Products constantly change in price for sometimes valid reasons, mostly that they are being cut short."
2021-05-27 06:39:12,stocks,"Seems to me that many answers here miss the real question. OP is expressing doubt in the equivalence of owning shares with owning a business, and the difficulty to enforce your ownership rights should you want to. Valid concerns.

At a basic level, “ownership” means “control”.
You own a car because you can use it as you please, for example.

So you are right in the sense that as a small investor, since stock ownership doesn’t give you any practical control on the business you “own”, you don’t really own it.

Shares have value because of a social contract. Management is expected to act with your interests in mind. You basically have to trust them.
Sure, you can sue if they don’t respect their duties, but if it comes to that you are unlikely to successfully extract much value back from the whole endeavor, plus the wasted time and effort.

In practice then, **value comes mostly from trust**. Your trust that the company will act in your best interest. And the trust of other investors that, believing the same, will be willing to buy the company’s shares from you.

As you noticed, some companies don’t give back money to shareholders either directly with dividends or indirectly by buybacks, so **owning shares is like owning fiat money**. You have no guarantee to be able to convert either in something material, their value lingers on trust in the business/government that emits them and in other people trusting them valuable."

The correct answer is because I as a shareholder and legally entitled to the profits of the firm. 


Lets say that I am the only one who buys those magic rocks from you. I can now go to the bank and tell them to give me all the money that the lemonade stand has in its bank account. The bank is legally required to give me that money. 

Furthermore every single penny that the lemonade stand makes in profit is legally my money. All of that profit will go to the lemonade stand bank account, BUT I can legally retrieve that money any time I wish to.

A share is the product - it represents part of the company that the company put on the market for some value at IPO or when the company issues shares.  Its sold initially by the company, but then sold by anyone in the market.

The market determines the price of the stock.  A stock’s value fluctuates often widely, but fundamentally is driven by supply and demand.  

Lets take TSLA for example - why is its price so high? Its due in large part from low supply compared to its demand. Its popular, and people in the market like to buy it because Elon Musk, the product, and because they innovate and may be growing.  As people buy it for more money, it causes the price to go up.  At some point, prices have to go down because all the people that bought it have it, and some will sell, but not everyone.  


Fundamentally though, that there is a market is why shares are worth money.  Without a way to trade, there is no value."

Think of if this way.  When the person/kid running the lemonade stand decided to sell the magic rocks for money.  A couple of things happened.

First, the person/kid is no longer completely in charge of how the lemonade stand is run.  The person/kid now needs a board of directors to direct him/her how to run the lemonade stand.

As a holder of the magic rocks, you then get to attend a meeting, and vote on certain things that's happening within the company.  If enough magic rock holders decide, they can kick out people for the board and install people they like.  The board -- if the former owner of the lemonade stand didn't keep enough magic rocks can be removed from the business.

As the lemonade stand is now required to submit financials for the owners of the magic rocks to look over, the lemonade stand is now in a way answerable to the people who hold the magic rocks."
2021-05-27 06:01:36,stocks,"Money is not just speculative. Money is backed by the combined sum of all assets plus production in a country as well as their ability to defend said things. Thus when you have a US dollar, you have claim to a asset or service within the USA. It is literally a contract and it is backed by something real.

Stocks are also a contract. It grants you the right to assets and production of a company both current and future. In theory, if said assets were sold, you would get a cut equivalent to your contract stake. In many ways, the asset it worth more than the cash you can extract. 

So whats the point to all of it you say? First, its an efficient system (though not perfect) and, as harsh/unfair/tragic as this sounds, it keeps us entertained (think hamster wheel). Thats not to say there isnt good in the system. There is good if used correctly and in a moral way but alas, it takes just a handful of people to misuse it and the result is a lot of others get hurt.

2021-05-26 22:59:50,stocks,"Stocks, like any asset, have *intrinsic* value and *speculative* value. 

If I go to buy a house, I want a nice neighborhood, a big yard with some mango trees, four bedrooms, etc. The price I'm willing to pay to live in that house is its intrinsic value. It's relative to rent, condition, other, comparable houses, and of course, the price the next buyer is willing to pay. 

Now if I go and say, ""in ten years, tbe price is going to double"" then I add a premium over its intrinsic value as speculative value. 

Now consider BlackBerry. For years, I've been following this company ever since they got out of the phone business because I like the sense of integrity in their leadership, the focus on privacy and security, and the innovative ways they've pivoted their business. I wanted to be a part of that. To me, owning shares of $BB has intrinsic value because I want my investment capital to go towards something I believe in.

There are both currencies and stocks that are out of date. Some have value because of rarity, collections only. The rest dont have any value because we dont recognize Roman coins anymore. Unless it's a rare coin nobody will pay for it, it ceases to have value. If you found a stock certificate for a company that went bankrupt 20 years ago that piece of paper has no value."
2021-05-27 01:20:43,stocks,"How much would you pay to buy a company that earns a million in profit a year? Let’s say the owner agreed to sell it for $10 million. You buy the business and make some improvements. Now the company is making $2 million a year. Would you then sell the company to someone else for $10 million? Of course not. You doubled the profits, at the very least you’d want $20 million for it. 

Now let’s say instead of selling to one owner, you sell to many owners. Or instead of selling all of the company, you just sell a quarter of it. That ownership is represented by stock shares. The same concept applies. Let’s say they you sold a million shares at $20 a piece to get your $20,000,000 valuation. The majority owner would run the company, but the others would also be owners, albeit, of varying degrees of relevance. If the company profits double again, would these owners sell their shares for $20? Of course not. The company would be worth at least $40 million. So if they all sell or some sell, they’d sell their shares for at least $40. 

A company is physical. Money is worth something. So as long as a company is growing physically and making more money, it’s more valuable. And it’s owners can sell their stake at any time. 

You owning 2 shares, you have no influence on the company. But your shares are not worth less than the shares owned by someone who owns 25% of the company. In fact, if you sell, it might just be that 25% owner who buys your shares as part of a larger buy to up his stake to 30%. For him, he does have influence. Probably a board seat or two or three. And that person has the power to do things that can make the company, and his investment, more valuable. Again—those shares represent the assets of the company. 

I know this is a simplification, and shares may be valued more highly or less highly regardless of the actual fundamentals, but stock does have an intrinsic value, and that value is the value of the company’s assets and potential growth. As those assets and growth accumulate, so should the stock price and the value of that ownership, even if you only own 2 shares."

You are a part owner of the company. If the company grows, the value of your investment grows.  You can then sell your share of that company for more than you paid, which equates to money for the shareholder. 

This is an overly simplistic explanation but nevertheless how it works.  There are of course other factors that drive stock price, outside of the current performance of the company."

Federal health officials have approved the first passenger cruise from the U.S. from Fort Lauderdale in June — but Florida’s governor insists he will block company plans to require passengers be vaccinated.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wednesday gave Royal Caribbean Group approval to start seven-night cruises to the Caribbean on its Celebrity Cruises brand ship, Celebrity Edge, on June 26, according to a CDC spokesperson. The ship is the first to win CDC approval for revenue cruises since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

The approval is a welcome milestone for the cruise industry, which has been paralyzed in the U.S. since March 2020 after COVID-19 outbreaks and deaths on several ships.

“For the past 15 months our conversations with friends and loved ones about seeing the world have been accompanied by the phrase ‘someday.’ I’m beyond proud and excited to say that day has arrived,” said Celebrity Cruises CEO Lisa Lutoff-Perlo in a statement. The June 26 cruise will leave from Port Everglades and visit Mexico and The Bahamas.

The CDC recommends all cruise passengers be vaccinated, but doesn’t require it. The agency has given cruise companies two options: meet vaccination thresholds of 98% of crew and 95% of passengers on the ship and start revenue cruises immediately, or forego the thresholds and first perform test cruises to ensure COVID protocols are working. Cruise ships that meet the threshold will have more relaxed mask and social distancing rules.

Celebrity Cruises spokesperson Susan Lomax said the company has opted to comply with the CDC’s vaccination threshold and will require all crew and passengers 16 years old and older to be vaccinated. The age requirement will drop to 12 years old on Aug. 1.

The go-ahead for Celebrity Cruises follows the CDC’s approval — also the first of its kind — of test cruises with volunteer passengers aboard Royal Caribbean International’s Freedom of the Seas ship from PortMiami in late June. Freedom of the Seas will require all crew and passengers 16 years old and older to be vaccinated, but will not meet the agency’s vaccination thresholds — meaning it must first perform test cruises before revenue cruises can begin.

Royal Caribbean Group is the second largest cruise company in the world with three cruise lines: Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea.

The restart plans clash with a law recently passed by the Republican-controlled state Legislature and promoted by Gov. Ron DeSantis that bars businesses, schools and government entities across Florida from asking anyone to provide proof of a COVID-19 vaccination. Under the new law, which takes effect on July 1, businesses can be fined up to $5,000 per violation. The only exemption in the law is for licensed healthcare providers.

“We’ve been very clear, the law is clear in Florida,” said Taryn Fenske, spokesperson for the governor. “You can’t mandate vaccine passports. We are interested to see how the CDC works with them so that they don’t get these exorbitant fines.”

Celebrity plans to restart its cruises days before the new law takes effect. Lomax said the logistics of its vaccine requirement are still being worked out.

“We are working with the Governor’s office to align on the path forward,” she said via email.

DeSantis sued the CDC last month, asking a judge to force the agency to drop its cruise safety requirements and allow cruises to begin immediately. The judge instead sent the case to mediation, which begins Thursday.

Wednesday’s approval signals long-sought relief for the cruise industry, which first began working with the CDC to restart cruises last October under a conditional sail order issued by the agency. Cruise companies had to enhance COVID-19 testing capabilities on their ships, report weekly crew test results to the agency and secure agreements with ports and local health authorities in the cities they plan to visit.

PortMiami will welcome volunteer passengers on board Royal Caribbean International’s Freedom of the Seas for a two-day test cruise on June 20. PortMiami also submitted an agreement to the CDC with Carnival Cruise Line that has not yet been approved."

But I still glance at the comments every now and then. And it seems that anytime I look a comments on stock warrants, they seem get a bad rep, or people get belittled for bragging about about their gains because ""it's not a stock, it's a stock warrant""

So I've strayed away from warrants temporarily until I know more about them, because I don't want to waste my time practicing something on my paper account, if I'm not going to be able to apply it on a real account. 

It all boils down to two questions. Can stock warrants be traded like a regular stock? And if so, are the short term capital gains tax rates similar to that of a regular stock?"
2021-05-26 20:29:25,stocks,Yes they can be traded like a stock. Yes any gains or losses is treated the same. Say if a warrant is priced at $1 and let's you buy the stock for $10 then the warrant is worth $11. If the stock is currently trading for $9 then it's not worth it. If it's trading for $12 then it may be worth it. Your broker will charge you to exercise the warrant to buy the stock. Schwab charges $39. The process will take a week or three and the value may have changed by then. Warrants have an expiration date after which they have no value.
2021-05-26 20:21:49,stocks,Yes and yes.
2021-05-26 21:43:03,stocks,"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warrant.asp

They are a long term option. That's why they have such big price moves. If they expire worthless they don't have big gains. Lots of SPAC warrants these days, buyer beware.

2021-05-27 00:00:00,stocks,"ViacomCBS surging as a potential buyout target, in the latest twist in the ""streaming wars"" VIAC stock jumped 3.81% today to $42.46 as rumours around a buyout continue to intensify, and I believe this is just the start. Several analysts agree with me, setting an average price target of $54 for the next 12 months.

I know it's been dismissed as a meme stock for the last wee while, due to the crazy rise and fall with the Archegos ‘incident’ and the hype around a possible pump after that implosion. But hear me out: I believe VIAC is actually a great value opportunity, with a solid 25-50% medium term upside.

There are a several reasons, which I’ll detail below, but essentially they have become a major buyout target as the streaming wars heat up between Netflix, Amazon, Disney and Apple. WarnerMedia (HBO) and Discovery just announced a huge merger, and Amazon has announced it would buy Hollywood studio MGM for just under $9 billion. That’s moving attention and speculation onto VIAC.

First, let’s analyse the quality of the business. ViacomCBS is a traditional broadcaster with a huge content library, that is currently pivoting from that dying business model and transitioning into streaming for obvious reasons. It is one of the world’s biggest content creators with its streaming service Paramount+ (rebranded from CBS All Access) carrying a content catalogue of 30,000 episodes, 2500 movies and 1000 live sports events. They are also diversifying with a free ad-driven service named Pluto TV, and premium offering Showtime.

Did I mention they have rights to the Superbowl? Content is king in streaming, and they have a huge number of popular shows and movies for a range of ages. To name a couple, they have StarTrek, NCIS, 60 Minutes, The Godfather, Indiana Jones, Mission Impossible, Top Gun, Hawaii 5-0, Teen Mom, The Late Late Show with James Cordon, Survivor, Key & Peele, Big Brother, The Amazing Race along with traditional offerings like CBS news.

One of their best attractions and a major competitive advantage in my view is their huge children’s content library through Nickelodeon, making them an attractive option for families. Titles include Spongebob Squarepants, PAW Patrol, Avatar: The Last Airdender, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Dora the Explorer, Blue’s Clues and much much more. The list is very long, and this in particular has been driving subscriber growth recently.

Despite all of this, the company is one of the cheapest current offerings in streaming, due to a bizarre collapse in their stock price which has nothing to do with them. They were bought by an aggressive hedge fund named Archegos Capital, which collapsed in March, tanking the share price from $100 to $37. It appears that hedge fund had artificially elevated the price to reach those astronomical levels, but I believe at $42 it’s still below its intrinsic value.

For example, the stock’s P/E ratio is around 9.5, compared to the wider film and TV industry’s average P/E of 29.8. Discovery’s P/E for example is 22, Netflix is insane at 60. At the very least I believe this represents an opportunity to get into the streaming market for a cheap entry point, as demand is expected to increase by 20% annually for the next decade.

They make a lot of money having recently beat earnings (and beating the 4 earnings before that), and continue to outperform, picking up an extra 6 million subscribers for Paramount+ over the last 3 months. That will intensify as they expand to new areas (they’re moving to Australia) and start to prioritise streaming more as, for example, the new Top Gun reboot will be on P+ two months after it hits theatres.

But most importantly, the extremely low share price and its huge content library makes it an attractive buyout proposition for bigger players with cash to burn like Amazon or Apple. There are way too many providers in streaming right now, some will sink and some will swim, and having a content library like ViacomCBS would be a major jewel in the crown.

Netflix in particular is vulnerable in my view, as traditional broadcasters are refusing to licence their content to them while they create their own streaming services, forcing them to pivot to creating more original content. That’s extremely expensive to make and they’re picking up massive amounts of debt while they do this.

Overall, ignore the pump and dump bullshit that’s been floating around on WSB for the last couple of months, I believe VIAC will only become more attractive as the streaming space consolidates. Every merger and buyout makes them more valuable, and I believe the consolidation will speed up as the big players need to move fast to avoid being left behind.

I have a small holding (40 shares, averaged at $41.50) and I’m hanging in for a 50% gain over the next 12-24 months. I'll continue to buy anytime it dips below $40. What do you think, have I missed anything here?"
2021-05-26 20:34:13,stocks,"If you listened to the last ER call and recent investors presentation, we also have a very good near term set of catalysts, primarily they are dropping 1,000 premium movies from their library on P+ in early June and this is on the heels of the theatrical release of Quiet Place II, which will probably lead box office sales over Memorial Day weekend. As you note, Chopra, the CFO, explicitly stated on the last ER they are indeed ending licensing agreements with third party streamers to bring that content exclusive to Paramount+, and by the end of 2021 will have over 2,000 movies on the service and Will strait dropping a new movie every week in 2022. The most important aspect of ViacomCBS is that they are the only media conglomerate left that is solely devoted to content creation and they are vertically integrated - i.e. they produce the content and have the distribution channels, they don’t need anyone else... MGM for instance is NOT vertically integrated. The one thing VIAC needs is scale. I don’t see Amazon buying them at this point after acquiring MGM, they made their move, and it woks cause some regulatory issues if they also went for VIAC; however, the big behemoth that is Apple, 2.1 trillion market cap.. compared to 26 billion for VIAC.. is likely to now make a move, and VIAC is the crown jewel.. in terms of content creation they are the second biggest global only second to Disney... that’s all VIAC does is create and distribute content across its distribution channels to generate ad and subscription revenue... they also have cutting edge addressable advertising technology that makes them even more attractive... there are just so many positive things going for VIAC sits mind boggling..."

2021-05-26 20:19:05,stocks,Is Apple really serious about streaming ? I don't see a buyout just yet since Paramount just merged with CBS
2021-05-27 00:17:46,stocks,"I largely agree with you and own the stock. However, here's a few things for you to consider:

1. Who do you think is going to acquire them? Realistically, you have 3 potential buyers - Netflix, Apple, and Amazon. I do not think Time Warner/Discovery is going to buy them because they seem to be also trying to sell themselves and used a corporate structure that is pretty much designed for just that. They are too big for anyone else

Netflix does not acquire content through acquisitions. They create their own. This has been their policy for a few years now.

Apple has a history of avoiding acquisitions. They are a 2Tn dollar company and the largest acquisition they made was only 3Bn dollars. In 2015, they had the chance to acquire Time Warner, which is a much larger and higher quality asset. They also had more than enough cash to do it. However, they walked away.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/25/apple-2015-time-warner-bundling-negotiations-almost-led-to-acquisition.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/25/apple-2015-time-warner-bundling-negotiations-almost-led-to-acquisition.html)

Amazon just acquired MGM studios for 8.5Bn. While I do think they are the most likely of the 3, they need time to digest MGM before making more acquisitions. Why would they not wait and see how their previous multibillion-dollar acquisition goes before making another? Also, you get big issues with antitrust.

2) Their valuation is low as a multiple of earnings. However, I would recommend you take a closer look at where those earnings are coming from. Substantially all of their profit comes from linear TV, which is being phased out in favour of streaming. In other words, most of their profits are in a declining market. They will not last longer unless they can successful build a streaming platform, which is far for certain. Netflix deserves a higher P/E because they are the dominant company in a growing industry that is taking over from linear TV and companies like ViacomCBS, giving them faster growth and a brighter future. Discovery's multiples are all screwed up because of their deal with Time Warner. Neither are great comps. I think using ViacomCBS's own valuation metrics before Archegos is a better idea. The company seems fairly valued. I would not expect it to double or increase 5x.

3) Be careful of sports. Unlike other content (movies, TV series, etc), they have almost no value after the live broadcast. The current deal requires them to pay billions to the NFL each year2033. In order to make more money off future super bowls, viacomCBS would need to enter a bidding war and win from competitors like Amazon, who are willing to lose billions on their video platforms for the next few years. In other words, the value of future super bowls is mostly going to be realized by the NFL and not ViacomCBS. In fact, I think there is a very good chance they could lose future super bowl broadcasts in a few years. Contrast that with the James Bond franchise. Past movies will continue to have some value and MGM is almost guaranteed to make money on the next sequel. Ever wonder why there are a thousand Fast and Furious movies? It's not because directors love it as an expression of their art. It's because the franchise prints money."
2021-05-26 20:49:58,stocks,This seems like an antitrust/monopoly debate waiting to happen with all these consolidations. Espically if Disney buys CBS after already buying Fox.
2021-05-26 22:33:36,stocks,"Everything you listed as a reason for viacom to be bought out is just a reason why they'll be a player in the streaming wars.

But why would viacom sell itself now?"

That’s fine drum it up wherever you can. That said couldn’t  disagree more with the assessment of Netflix, I don’t know why so called “DD” proliferators seem to keep thinking Netflix is in trouble. They are anything but, they have a 10 year head start, they 100% fund their own originals, they have market penetration globally—which continues to grow, they have brand recognition globally, their corporate culture and benefits for employees far exceed traditional studios, they have drained talent from  every  studio—wether it be Disney, Dremworks, you name it. They have the same thing tesla has which is tons of data on users, to work their own “AI”, they have silos of info on users, and unlike Tesla more like TMUS they have a pure play. They have known content would get pulled for years now, that’s why you have seen and continue to see so many horrible and horribly successful originals from Netflix for years now. Who has more? Who is even close? Netflix is not a player for Viac who has a different business model entirely, anyone that says that shows their lack of understanding in their so called “DD.” I guess that’s bound to happen when your analysis is simply cut and paste. But hey I’m all in on VIAC ;)

If they were going to buy their way in they would have done it by now. Apple could buy almost anyone with the cash pile they have, including stuios like lionsgate, MGM before Amazon bought them, Fox before Disney bought them, at one point people were talking about them buying Netflix. But it’s not like apple needs a studio for a content library in the first place. They have so much cash that they could fund extensive content creation for a decade and still have billions in the bank. Just for reference, apple has approximately $200B in cash on hand that they are always adding more to, and Netflix revenue as a company is $25B per year. 

Plus, the iTunes Store hosts movies and shows for purchase from all the studios and buying exclusivity of an entire studio is a good way to have that reciprocated, which would be a big hit to the easy money apple makes from the cut they take on digital content sales."

Their streaming platform is trash. Biggest dud launch ever. They have a deep content pool, but when you have Fist of Fury as your number 2 top movie on launch, you blew it. 

Their biggest problem is that their core business is still linear TV and that market is collapsing quickly, so this deal would be an absolute massive gamble on nothing but the content. As bad as AT&T got burned on Warner I'm not sure there would be a buyer. Plus, a buyer would have to put up a massive antitrust breakup fee in case the deal got nixed by regulators.

2021-05-27 14:58:27,stocks,"platform-wise, yes there is definitely some growing to do for CBS and they joined the game waaay too late. Amazon has rights to NFL's thursday night football currently, but they were not actively seeking a partnership with the NFL. the way i saw this deal, the NFL set a price point that regular tv networks deemed too high purposely because they knew Amazon has the capital and wants to get their skin in the game or test the waters at least in addition to their marketing power.

one of the few leverages the traditional TV networks have are local team broadcasts. their infrastructure is already in place for this. this is where a lot of other streaming services lack. all the major sports networks that big streamers usually carry (NFL TV, NBA TV, MLB TV) blackout local games. while things like the super bowl are important to viewership, that is just icing on the cake to me. local viewership is just as important, especially when generational talent rolls around, for that consistent income. athletes nowadays are human billboards. coupled with talks that college athletes will be able to be paid/endorsed heating up. Patrick Mahomes, the next football prodigy in many people's eyes, has singlehandedly increased viewership/interest by leaps and bounds. traditional tv networks are able to show these guys more regularly with local viewership + just being able to show more national games in general rather than the once a week 1 match up thursday night football. CBS in particular also has a long list of sportscasters that have been around for decades and they can sway viewership also, albeit on a much smaller scale. your average sports fan is going to pick the service where we can see our teams more often rather than just the ""big games"". these people are loyal and will go where ever their team goes. CBS already includes local sports as a streaming option, not sure about the others.

this is territory where it gets tricky for big streamers because of the (for lack of a better term) ""cyclical"" nature of sports, both season and draw appeal of the athletes. unless big streamers acquired a traditional tv network or became a network themselves, they would likely have to work something out with their competitors. it'd be too much of a risk to ride only on the big games because the outcome of a sporting event can tank viewership/ratings in the blink of an eye as what it was with the most recent super bowl. i wouldn't put it passed a company like amazon to do this with the way they've been going, but it seems like a hill that may be too difficult to climb."
2021-05-27 01:13:19,stocks,"TV libraries are not nearly as valuable as people think. Netflix had years to gather different content onto their network and see how much viewership it actually gets and they have stayed away from most of the TV show back catalogues. I don't think people really watch them, except for a few big shows Friends, The Office, etc.  Same with old movie catalogues, they are not worth as much as people think."

2021-05-27 01:27:14,stocks,"Yeah, I may be projecting my own viewing habits. I feel it is more for marketing, and they will contribute much less eyeballs on the actual content than they think. Does anyone want to watch re-runs of Home Improvement or something, no. Even if it was popular in it's day. Most older movies haven't aged well, you can comb through that 4000 and probably have 400 worth watching. Just my opinion."
2021-05-27 01:31:19,stocks,"Agreed no one is watching re runs of home improvement. But I think legacy titles are very valuable, which is what made MGM attractive for Amazon, because people will go back to watch the classics. They have James Bond and Stargate. ViacomCBS has that in spades: The Godfather, Mission Impossible and Indiana Jones just to name a couple. It’s the brand that counts."

Business Insider is reporting today that Amazon is looking to make a move into the physical retail pharmacy space. What are the implications for the overall pharmacy sector?

* Does Amazon make a play for Rite Aid to gain 2,500+ stores throughout the USA immediately, or does it take the slow path that ultimately leads to failure and dropping out of the space?

2021-05-27 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 26, 2021  

**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 26, 2021**

Stocks mostly consolidated today, finishing modestly higher led by a 0.34% gain in the Nasdaq (QQQ). After the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May it is very encouraging to see market volatility calming down and holding on to recent gains. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered.

New economic data released yesterday shows consumer confidence dipped in April, compared to March, even as more social distancing restrictions were lifted across the US. The Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. 

Yesterday, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

**Highlights** 

* Great vaccination numbers coming out in the US. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States has administered 289,212,304 doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country as of Wednesday morning and distributed 359,849,035 doses. 165,074,907 people had received at least one dose, while 131,850,089 people are fully vaccinated as of Wednesday morning. For context, the entire US population is roughly 328.2 million.
* Amazon (AMZN) announced that former CEO of Amazon Web Services Andy Jassy will formally take over as CEO of the e-commerce giant on July 5. A few months ago, Jeff Bezos, current CEO and founder, announced he was stepping down and transitioning to a role as the Executive Chairman.
* Shares of Ford (F) jumped more than 8% after the company said it was raising it’s investment on electric vehicles from $22 to $30 billion. The company recently announced the all-electric F-150.
* Amazon announced it was purchasing Hollywood movie studio MGM Holdings for $8.45 billion, bolstering Amazon’s streaming service. Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios said, “The real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM’s talented team. It’s very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling ""
* Mortgage applications slid by the most since early April last week, with a decline in refinances dragging down overall loan volumes even as purchases ticked up for another week. The Mortgage Bankers Association's (MBA) weekly market composite index for mortgage applications fell 4.2% during the week ended May 21. This followed a 1.2% rise during the prior week.
* Volkswagen sold more than 206,000 electric vehicles over the past 12 months in Western Europe, more than double the 102,500 made by Tesla over the same time period, according to Schmidt Automotive Research.

If this stock has a previous ATH of 30 dollars, and its a new company meaning that there is a lot of room of improvement and expansion and potentially the stock will each 30-50 by the end of this year or at least climb back near its previous ATH. Is it a good idea to sell @ 6 dollars, add another 400 dollars to return the investment value to 1,000 and then buy again @ 6 ? or just hold and wait for the stock to rise ?

Based on my extremely limited understanding, these hedge funds need to keep adding additional shorts to cover their initial shorts, but this isn't something that can go on forever. At some point they get squeezed and get killed with losses. 

If that happens, won't some of these hedge funds go bankrupt and their stocks become available? Thus lowering the price of the stocks they have large investments in? Thinking similar to how Archegos went down and their stocks took massive hits. $VIAC went down about 50% if I recall correctly. 

Is the risk to this squeeze becoming a much larger Archegos situation across many more stocks and causing a major market crash a legitimate concern?"

2021-05-26 20:25:45,stocks,">Yeah, to my understanding, the main thing you have to do is pay interest. 

Well, no, not really.

First you have to pay borrowing costs in addition to the interest you pay on your margin account. And the borrowing costs depend on how difficult it is to borrow that stock. So for something undergoing a short squeeze the borrowing costs snowball higher and higher.

Second, as the price of the stock increases, so do your short ""losses"" or amount of money you owe. If this gets too high then you'll get margin called.

So you can't just remain short forever waiting for the price to drop.

This will only happen if people sell. But if they know too many people are short and nobody sells then the price just goes up and eventually shorts will be forced to cover."

who is ""them""?

of course it can be 400 for some accounts.

but not for everybody.

and why do you think they would sell shares if they were about to get margin called? where exactly would they get those shares?

they're already short. dumping more shares they don't have means being even more short. if they were about to get margin called, shorting even more will just nuke their account. you don't get out of a margin call by increasing your debt even more.

also when you are about to get margin called, your broker won't let you enter into new positions. in fact they will stop you before you get to that point. I've been unable to open new positions in my margin account since end of last week because I have negative buying power, and I'm still far from a margin call.

>You dont dump 200 000 share worth almost 100 mill for fun

no. you do it to manipulate the price.

but they didn't do it because they were about to get margin called."

Its latest results I thought were pretty robust considering it had to deal with Covid / reduced demand, Texan weather and not great commodity prices. These are a pretty rare mix of events that is going to cause a strain, and yet they weathered well.

&#x200B;

They are an extremely well diversified mid-stream company. They have many more miles of gas than oil, have 10s of thousands of miles in total, significant storage, multiple refining locations and also ports.

&#x200B;

It is now increasingly hard to build even a single pipeline, can you imagine trying to get sign-off for 50000 miles of pipeline? Political winds have given large pipeline companies a significant barrier to entry and competition.

&#x200B;

Although it's easy to say that political winds and social pressures are moving away from fossil fuels, but it's not an argument that makes me fearful of investing. Not all fossil fuels are equal, going from coal > oil > gas, in that order. Coal exists and is being actively phased out by most of the Western world,, but oil and gas still have decades to run. The data I've seen suggests that although oil falls as a % of total energy by 2050, due to demand from developing world, actually increases in barrels. A lot of people don't realise but less than half of oil goes toward vehicles, and you would be astonished to know what it's used in. Gas will have an even longer shelf-life as the cleanest of the fossil fuels.

&#x200B;

Specifically for mid-stream companies, a lot are fairly heavily indebted, and incurred that debt building networks. Once built, the marginal cost is actually quite low, and whereas a similar logic exists in other utilities, those utilities require much more intensive further investments and upkept, for example telcos constantly having to buy bandwidth. I prefer pipelines accordingly - less money needed for infrastructure upkeep means more money coming back to me.

&#x200B;

For me, as a Brit, the fact its an MLP is actually a benefit. Usually I get charged a 15% withholding tax on my American dividends, but as MLPs pay distributions, I am not charged for this. My brokerage takes care of the K-1 paperwork that I understand is a bit of a hassle, but I never see it. A near 8% yield on an American stock is extremely rare, and only my UK miners exceed that (helped as I also get no divi tax on them either as I keep it in an ISA, similar but much better than your IRAs)

&#x200B;

If you like pipelines but don't want to deal with an MLP, I'd probably opt for ENB or KMI."

Does this exist? I think it sounds a bit like a Trailing Stop Buy order, but almost everything I read about those is for a sell scenario so I'm not sure. I'm pretty new to this so just wanted to test my assumptions first.


Here's the scenario I want:

\- StockA is at $100 and I place a buy order with a $10 trail  
\- StockA falls to $90, $80, $70, $60; order should not execute
\- StockA rises to $69; order should not execute
\- StockA rises to $70; order should execute

Am I right in thinking that a Trailing Stop Buy order with a $10 trail should behave like this? If no, is there another order that would?

I understand that I need to hold long-term, and that with SE, I missed the bigger dip last year.

What about long-term outlook?  I bought 5 shares @$257 and I can't really find any information as to why it's dropping right now.

I am happy with the other stocks I bought, but this one was a speculative pick that I went with after reading the Motley Fool recommendation.  I feel maybe I got it too late.

Latin America is a really low penetration market and   MELI is building a competitive advantage by having an Amazon-style shipping network. So this means that shoppee for example can't stroll in and take market share as easily. Apart from that MELI would be profitable, just barely.

I started low and i have been building up my portfolio every month, i have seen it being +150% and -35%.

I learned the hard way on how to buy the dip and never sell at a loss.

To INVEST is not so hard, just don't pick a crazy stock with no fundamental analysis (what happened with Nikola) and if you keep investing bit by bit every month it shouldn't be so bad.

Amazons catalog has also come into lot of scrutiny with fake reviews and cheap goods, undercutting sellers and private labeling their own goods, etc. list goes on. Ecommerce competition is heating up daily basis. Azure and G cloud have gotten significantly better and continue to do so.

I also don’t like Amazon dipping it’s toes into so many things. I wish it focused on just dominating global commerce and AWS. Now it’s Pharmacy, Food, movies, etc. 

Given all of that, Amazon is worth $1.7T. It will be difficult to increase the market cap x3+ anytime soon. I think the money will see a better ROI in other companies moving forward. I rode Amazon for 8 years, I’m done with it. Too much risk and not enough reward potential.

I believe inflation will hit the markets in the near future, you should look at the unemployment rate, and CPI index.

2021-05-27 17:18:46,stocks,"I'm not a financial adviser but I personally have also invested a significant part of my portfolio in BlackBerry, planned to keep for semi long-term (like 10 years). McKinsey & Co. has done a thorough research on Blackberry's security software development plans that are aimed at the rapidly growing EV market. Their research conclusion expected Blackberry to grow significantly in the coming years due to the uprising of the EV market. They obviously can't predict the future, but the fact that a well-informed consultancy company like McKinsey made this prediction persuaded me to invest in it as well. 

It is hard to tell if it is gonna give you any profits on the short term but if you can afford to keep the investment for the long term it would probably be a very smart investment. Send me a PM if you need any more information about the research itself or anything else!"
2021-05-26 21:17:55,stocks,"You’re son is gambling not investing, there is a difference. If you want to actually invest I recommend staying far away from any stock in the same pool as BB or GME or AMC. The prices of these securities are built purely on speculation and have no sort of fundamental value to justify their current price.

It’s great that he has made money but the securities he is purchasing do not have the fundamental support to continue to remain at the current price given a long term horizon.

If you are interesting in making some quick money then by all means you can speculate on the stock and buy some shares but there is a very big different between speculation and investing, a line that seems to have been blurred by the large influx of amateur investors in the last year or so. 

If you want to invest for the long term I recommend holding reliable proven ETFs or index funds such as the VTI or SPY. Be careful putting your money into these speculative securities, you might make some money but you will get burned if you plan on holding long term."

2021-05-26 22:13:10,stocks,AMC will be a short run. It's being forced up. Pay close attention and sell before the crash. Bb is looked at as an undervalued stock. They are making great moves with new software but that doesn't exactly mean they will go up. If you invest in BB also keep a close eye as they are trying to force that hand but not to the extent of GME and AMC. If you are looking to ride the rocket SPCE is also on the short up stroke who knows where the peak is. But there will be a peak.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nbn3ks/ok\_enough\_is\_enough\_now\_i\_need\_to\_cut\_down\_some/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nbn3ks/ok_enough_is_enough_now_i_need_to_cut_down_some/)

I got lots of comments encouraging me just to hold, and I held. I didn't sell anything. 

As of now, I have recovered about 31K of the 50k, and only 19K down. My plan is once I am even, I will try to move the most speculative stocks into ETFs.

Basic take away is a company is worth X today when you consider all its assets minus its liabilities plus the discounted future cash flows of the company. The trick is nobody knows what the discount rate should be, so valuations fluctuate. The key idea is buy a company with a margin of safety such that even with the unknowns you are likely to earn a return in excess of what you could get from a safe asset."

2021-05-27 08:05:25,stocks,"Just my 2 cents. You probably won't be happy about any recommendation depending on what happens. A 70% is huge and if I were you I would take out my original investment, put half of the rest at a stop loss and let the rest sit. But locking in now is a guaranteed 70% no one can take away. On the other hand if it goes up further you might be salty later.

Also this is an unusual stock so many would say to sell, the percentages are way higher than what people are used to. I accidentally bought a pennystock because of a 1 letter typo, that has never happened to me before and I'm way more cautious since then (happened while I was with my family at christmas). The pennystock was one that shot up 3200% and when I noticed the mistake it was already up 500%. Asking on Reddit were only sell recommendations and I would have missed out on a ton of profit if I sold. But this is always a huge risk."
2021-05-27 00:00:00,stocks,"Restaurants, more Bloated than a Pregnant Woman:   

 

In my life, I have developed a love for Restaurants. The unlimited drinks at a cheap price, the quality boneless Buffalo wings, I love it all. However, there is one thing I have noticed researching Restaurant stocks (starting with my favorite screener, Finviz): many of them are overvalued. Granted, the COVID 19 Disease has plagued and closed many restaurants; so its’ understandable if a restaurant temporarily loses money. However, if a company has little cash, negative cash flow, and a lot of debt, it is likely that the company will either had to get acquired by a speculator, reorganize, or, liquidate. I have three brief case studies that will show you how Restaurant stocks fare in the market.

**First is Dave & Busters (PLAY)**, the Restaurant/Arcade amalgamation that is also noted for their Buffalo wings. The market capitalization for the company is $2.02 billion. In terms of stock price, the company has gone up in price. From $13.23 on August 21, 2020, the company now trades at $42.45. Is it worth it? Let us find out. 

The company’s equity is only $153 million ($169 million in 2020). With long-term debt, PLAY has $596 million in long-term debt. PLAY also has $1.3 billion in operating lease liabilities (which means that PLAY has a lot of rent to pay). In simpler terms, imagine having to pay $1.3 billion for an apartment without leasing it to anyone. The apartment would go out of business. And remember, the company has not fully recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic! 

Current Assets are low for the company compared to their liabilities. PLAY has only $11.9 million in cash, with only $24 million in inventories. The company also lost $49 million in Free-Cash-Flow. Yes, 2019 had a positive of Cash Flow ($288 million), which is a good way to pay off debt. However, it will take a couple of years before the Restaurant business recovers; and cash cannot pay off the debt. The company has an Enterprise Value (Market Capitalization plus Debt minus Cash) of $3.92 billion. Finally, the company trades at over 13 times its’ book value. 

Would you invest into a company with little cash, lots of debt, loss of revenue? Probably not. 

**Second is Potbelly Corporation (PBPB)**. The company is a sandwich shop that is based in the mid-West as well as select cities in states such as Texas. Akin to PLAY, the company has gained a lot in Stock price; going up from $3.50 in November 2020 to its’ current price of $6.97. Is the company worth $193.81 million? Let us find out. 

PBPB, if invested in December 2015, would only be worth $40 in December 2020. By contrast, $100 in the NASDAQ in the same time would be worth over $260 – and that is in spite of the Pandemic. In 2018, the company lost $8.54 million. In 2019, the company lost $23.59 million despite only having $13 million less in revenue (this was due to income taxes). In 2020, the company lost $65.67 million in 2020 due to the Pandemic. 

PBPB only has $11.13 million in cash, and $3 million in inventories. Operating lease liabilities is $35.32 million, wiping out the Current Assets ($23.31 million). Total liabilities are $277.90 million compared to only $283.36 million in assets. PBPB only as $5.5 million in equity; yet, is valued at $193.81 million! Imagine buying $5.50’s worth of Lemonade for $194. Net cash provided by operating activities has gone down from $31 million in 2018 down to $18.17 million in $11.61 million in 2020. 

PBPB’s price is not worth the value. 

**Third and finally is Noodles & Company (NDLS)**

NDLS is exactly as it says in the tine: it sells Pasta meals. I have only been in there once in my life. The market values the company at $559 million. Akin to the other two food companies, NDLS has increased in Price over the past year (from $6.40 on November 2nd, 2020) to $12.34 on May 26, 2021. Is it worth the increase? Let us tune in, turn on, and drop out. 

Since 2016, NDLS has had a loss of net income four times (as high as $71.7 million in 2016) out of five.  With Cash Flows, NDLS has been variable, with last year generating only $9.12 million compared to $30.06 million in 2019. NDLS only has $7.8 million in cash and $9.6 million in inventories. Current Assets are $23.71 million. Current liabilities (including $26.1 million in current operating lease liabilities in 2020) are $58.13 million. In other words, immediate liquidity is impossible. Long-term debt is $41 million. 

NDLS may not be as bad as the other two stocks; but, it still is not worth the increase in stock price that happened this past year.

Prices should (in a perfect world) go up if the value is higher than the price. This is not a perfect world, however, and, the market does not reflect price in value sometimes. Restaurant investors beware."

Story: So I have recently decided, I want to eat way less - to no meat and therefore had a lot of exposure with plantbase food and alternatives. I read some articles about this topic and I am now convinced, that the market for plant base food could have a bit of potential. 

Not just because vegetarien-diet is in the uprise, but because the alternatives get better and better (imo). This makes them a direct competition to the meat industry in long term, since the taste will no longer be a major differentiator in the future. 

I mean I am far for an expert and would not give my arguments too much weight , but I kind of want to be invested in one, or a few companies, that are in this branche.

I really have not thought about writing in this subreddit and just went with a stock i randomly read about. This was kind of a mistake i guess, because I invested in this stock, and since then it lost 70% of its value.

So I see it growing a bit especially in the heavily growing medical field just my opinion"

2021-05-26 22:43:38,stocks,Thanks! I appreciate the response. I’ve got an order in for a handful of shares.
2021-05-26 22:46:24,stocks,Same sadly I don't have mad money to spend I am putting what extra money I can into my investments. I wish I could throw 1k into it but I add a little every paycheck and build up my shares. But I am paying heavy attention into the market now and reading the trends and trying to decide if I feel it will have a heavy need in the future and if it will grow. I'm a novice but I try to put a lot of study into what I do
2021-05-26 22:48:18,stocks,Exact same boat.  My handful here is only twelve shares. Slowly building and trying to research and learn as I go. Best of luck!
2021-05-26 22:51:08,stocks,You as well. Glad I could help with a little knowledge I picked up it's actually not useless trivia haha
2021-05-26 22:17:39,stocks,"What’s the point of diversification? Safety, more or less. By spreading my your wealth across many companies, the odds that you’ll lose significantly are less then if you go all in on one and it goes belly up. 

On the other hand, the more diversified you are, the more you limit your gains. If you invest 100,000 across 50 companies and one of them doubles, you now have 102,000. If you had invested everything in that company, you’d have 200,000. If you diversify too much, you may as well buy an ETF. 

Personally, I have large positions in a select few stocks I believe will do well in the short term. My risk is higher, but normally, so are my rewards."
2021-05-26 20:52:12,stocks,"Yes, you're fine, as long as you're paying attention to all 28, and from the sounds of it, you are.  

I was trained not to have so many tickers, but eventually learned that being involved is better from an emotional standpoint, as long as you have the time and information capacity to manage them.  

Emotion is an important factor for long term retail investors, and having a lot of tickers means that there's always something interesting to pay attention to, to anticipate.  

I worry you're not truly diversified if you're saying you have a bunch of Ark holdings and big tech.  That sounds more concentrated and correlated perhaps.

One issue though is time spent versus dollars.  28 truly diverse positions should mean you're spending 14-28 hours per week.  Is spending 14-28 hours per week worth it for the incremental performance across a $40,000 portfolio?  Typically not.  Of course if you don't have an alternative way to get paid for those hours, and you're building a skill and discipline for a 400k or 4,000k portfolio, then it's time well spent.  I just question when I see people doing 30 hours of DD and then announce they own 10 shares @ $30/share.  They could make far more $/hour flipping burgers and getting an ETF instead, that's all."
2021-05-26 21:08:02,stocks,"When you stop doing DD on what you own, it is too many.  Up to that point it is about how much time you want to spend."

Or do index funds no or low fees good luck"
2021-05-27 01:37:21,stocks,I hold 5 🌚. Amazing results so far. Don’t expect the run to continue at this pace
2021-05-27 03:59:58,stocks,"There is no too many. Of course depth of research will suffer if you actually plan to research e.g. 500 companies and mimic the s&p 500 to avoid fees and gain dividends, and you would need to actively manage it - which is near impossible if you have a job and other things to do. But that said the market is the market, you could have 10 identical companies but only 1 of them comes out as the one increasing by far the most, so do you want to invest into all 10 and divide profits/losses or hope to find the 1 increasing so much? In reality it's not 1 and 10, but 10 to 1000 or even more, depending on which sector and what you are looking for. And both will result in kind of the same. The less stocks you choose to invest in, the higher the risk of underperforming or even face losses. The more stocks you invest in, the lower the risk of underperformed but you will minimize potential profits.

And if you now take 100 people that invest into 1-2 stocks the 10 of them that were successful will tell you that its better to do so, while the 90 that underperformed the S&P 500 or had a loss will either stop trading or not talk about it, giving you a wrong perception.

Edit: and btw for DD talk, go on the subreddits that have DD as flair, filter for it and now check the prices of the stocks. If you find multiple for one type of industry then only the best performing one is the winner, but take the others and see their performance compared to something like the S&P 500. A majority of traders lose a majority of their money, while an even larger majority (I think it was over 90%) fails to beat the S&P 500, meaning it would have been just better to go with the S&P 500 instead of their own research. In the end most depends on what you end up picking and if you look at the last 30 years of top performers it was not the majority that wins here."
2021-05-27 05:43:47,stocks,I've got a similar amount of capital. 4 stocks that I believe can grow and 4 ETF's for diversification. I'm always keeping an eye out for new additions.
2021-05-26 20:35:55,stocks,I got about $100k invested and I’ve got 7 stocks
2021-05-27 13:36:40,stocks,"Is there such a thing as too many?  
Investing in a broad index ETF such as SPY guarantees you are the owner of every company that goes bankrupt.  Buying a bunch of companies will probably result in some 10, 20, 30-bagggers. You will also have some losers, but you can off-set those with gains in taxable accounts.  
The maximum you can lose on a $1,000 investment is $1,000 but the maximum you can gain is technically infinity. More realistically, up to 10-20x -- which means you would need 10-20 other stocks to go banko just to break even (and it's not too likely anybody will have that many companies go to $0). 
Back in the .com boom, anybody that bought a bunch of tech companies would've had some bankruptcies like Etoys, Pets.com, etc. But they would've also had insane gains in Amazon, Apple, Priceline, etc -- especially if they're in it for the long term. Based on that experience, I'm taking the same approach to EV stocks and it had turned out very well for me. And with a taxable account, a 100% loss on a stock is more like a 70-75% loss, as you can net that loss against your other gains, which means you'll be writing Uncle Sam a smaller check because of your losses.  

I don't think there is anything as too many stocks; over the course of many years, having a vested interest in many companies will allow you to see the 'personalities' of the stocks over time, which will allow you to gain trust in certain ones. Sure, you can do your DD and look at charts and filings prior to making an investment, but seeing 1st hand how some weather business cycles, recessions, pandemics, etc. will build your trust in management over time. You may need to wait years for another good entry point but when you get it, you can confidently jump in with both feet and make some huge gains.  
TL;DR - IMO, at least keep a passive eye on your positions and no amount is too many."
2021-05-26 22:59:55,stocks,Very helpful
2021-05-27 13:52:49,stocks,"I see your approach, I don’t think it is bad, but than again I would rather put more in my higher conviction picks. You can’t keep track of 40 stocks the same way you keep track of 10. 

You are building your own EV ETF, that is something else than investing in individual stocks, just based on the stock alone. It can work for you, but right now I hope you are not overinvested in that industry, because most of these will not be able to keep their current valuations (Tesla, Nio,..).

BTW, in an ETF you also have giant gainers that often drive the Index, it is really interesting if you look at the data, how important the highest gainers are and if you buy let’s say 40 stocks with out one, you will most likely underperform."
2021-05-26 23:04:42,stocks,"You will never be able to diversify enough with individual stocks while also being able to keep up with all of them. Best way is to dedicate the majority of ones portfolio to index's, then put a small portion into individual companies."

2021-05-27 12:05:18,stocks,"I’m long Ford and it is the largest component of my portfolio.

Ford is not trying to reinvent the wheel and they’re not trying to be the Apple of the automotive industry like Tesla or the aspirational pipe dream companies (e.g., Rivian, Lordstown, Nikola) are all trying to be. Ford recognizes that until fully autonomous vehicles become a practical reality for the average consumer, most people will not want their driving experience to change all that much. Most people don’t want to feel like they’re in a minimalist spaceship despite what the Tesla circlejerk would have you believe (although I’m also long TSLA for other reasons which I’ll explain below). Ford’s electrified vehicles feel more like a typical car. It doesn’t feel like a radical change in your daily driving experience. Most people don’t like radical and rapid change. They like what they are familiar with. Ford gets that. The F-150 Lightening shows that they get it.

Ford is going all in on electric. So is VW and GM. Through their collective weight, institutional knowledge bases, and economies of scale they’re going to eventually crush Tesla and all the relatively new automotive manufacturers who all want to fundamentally and radically change people’s driving experiences. In 2020 Tesla delivered roughly 500,000 vehicles globally. Compare that to Ford delivering nearly 4.2 million (and in non pandemic years Ford is pushing 6 million deliveries annually). Volkswagen Group delivered 9.2 million vehicles across all brands in 2020. I just don’t think Tesla can stay competitive as a mass market auto manufacturer in the long run despite their impressive growth in production in recent years.

Where Tesla can excel (and this is why I’m long TSLA) is by pivoting to becoming an OEM supplier of batteries to major automakers like Ford and VW Group who have gone all in on electric and have the production capacity to drown out Tesla as an automaker. Tesla knows high capacity batteries better than just about anyone. But more importantly, Tesla understands how to produce large quantities of batteries and is constantly pursuing ways to expand their already impressive battery production capabilities. They have the potential to become the go to energy storage solutions provider to everything ranging from the automotive industry to construction/heavy industry and utilities/power producers. Tesla was only able to make the demand for high capacity batteries that currently exists by stimulating the growth of the EV market with their own cars. But they’ve done that, and in the process opened people’s eyes across a multitude of industries to the potential behind investing in energy storage research and development. I think they’ll eventually back out of the business of building cars and selling them to consumers (at least if they’re smart). 

Ford is a great automaker play. Tesla is a great battery and energy storage play. It’s frustrating for me to see people constantly compare the two to each other as so many have done in this thread.

Best of luck with your investing journey, OP!"

FORD is solid  though, with the recent F150 news (on the back of the aluminum body / bed of the prior F150), it didn't suffer as badly during the prior financial debacle that GM did.

You never can nor should try to time the market perfectly (unless you're sitting on some catastrophic insider news), and should be looking out for the long term.

Inflation will affect future earnings, and a weaker dollar will make exports to other countries less desirable as well.  That's a lesson for another day though.

I have followed / opened a LOT of news stories of this supposed criticism, but none of them go into what, specifically, is being asked of these oil companies.  And, somehow, 'Green' board members are being forced into companies that cater to those of us who prefer to use internal combustion engines.  It just seems like it's a backward attempt to make the world all use electric vehicles, and that many 'News' sites are in on the propaganda, but none of them are doing investigative reporting to discern just who is demanding lower carbon footprints from oil companies, why (what their motives are), and to what end they are expecting change.

So in the Dutch province Groningen there is a huge gas field but due to overextending (too much gas has been “pulled”) many houses in that province have been damaged severely. Because the gas field has become more empty the pressure it held on the soil has been disappearing too resulting in local earth quakes and soil becoming unstable. These 2 effects are damaging many houses in this province which is costing the Dutch government millions in repairing costs. So they want to stop these effects by stopping gas production and insert carbon into the gas field to try and build the soil pressure up again to prevent further erosion and costs/damage.

That's a cool thing to wave your hands and say but it's pretty meaningless when you're assuming values. You're also assuming it only effects things at one point in the supply chain, and ignoring that it has a compounding effect on products with a large amount of oil derivatives built in to the product and it's supply chain.

>People react very little to the increase of gas prices.

What planet are you from? Gas effects everything from people actually using it to the costs of end products. In the US it's always an issue during election cycles.

>I never heard anyone cancelling trip plans because gas got too expensive.

Another cool thing to say and wave your hands but what the fuck are you talking about?

People not only routinely calculate gas prices for road trips they also look at the cost of plane tickets before they fly. Yes, they probably do this BEFORE they book a hotel so ya you're probably right no one has ever \*technically\* cancelled a road trip they had already planned out and booked accommodations for because of a rise in gas prices.

>However, working on reducing consumerism...  ...does a much better impact to reduce oil usage for a much lower cost to society.

Even here in the US people complain about gas prices going up, but still will buy big SUVs and go for camping trips in the mountains. The cost of gas is minimal compared to what people spend in housing, healthcare and taxes. My cars always costed more in maintenance and insurance than in gas and I travel a lot. And plane tickets are just marginally affected by oil prices as well. No more than 20% of a ticket costs is out of fuel. If the fuel doubles the price (impossible) the ticket will increase from $100 to $120, hardly beyond the change of plans threshold of those who can afford travelling by air. Most of the costs are maintenance, capital immobilization of expensive airplanes, airport use, staff and taxes.

>Too bad because of your anti-corporate bullying stance you seem to be against using any market forces to make this happen so I guess just more hand waving is your platform?

?? I stand to what I said. The solution is much cheaper than diluting the higher fuel prices into the whole society. A small bump in fuel prices makes little difference in demand, but people will get poorer out of it (even if just a small fraction out of everyone). Creating simple rules and adopting cheap but smart solutions costs much less to the macro-economy than just making fuel more expensive, which causes almost no difference in people's consumption habits."

2021-05-26 21:33:05,stocks,"Alright, so my first comment was down voted for whatever reason. I'll try to answer the question more specifically. Most of the people posting in here telling you that you'll just lose money are not answering the question.

A good stock for investing in is also a good stock for daytrading most of the time. What we look for as day traders is a company with good fundamentals, and at least two solid quarters of earnings/growth. Then we look at how much volatility the stock has. Volatility within a range is excellent for us. Say you found a stock thats been performing above and beyond expectations for at least two quarters. You then need to identify the normal range of that stock. Keep an eye on it in a watch list. Learn its daily patterns. One day when you notice that it's fallen below it's normal trading range, and there's no news to support that drop...we usually look for a 5% drop on growth stocks...that's when you buy shares. Depending on the price of the underlying stock, we try to trade anywhere from 100 shares to 10k shares on a single stock, in multiple lots. Your goals, and thus earnings will be different from others with different size accounts and risk tolerances. I started out with a goal of $50 per trade and was happy with that. Then as I learned the ropes I slowly increased my position sizes and thus my earning potential on individual plays. I usually trade between 500 and 2000 shares per position, and I look for $200+ profit as my exit. I set limits and take profits so I can move on the the next play or re-enter the same ticker again and again and again. I've played a single ticker probably 10 times in a single day.

I don't short. That's not for me. I only play to the upside, and only on solid stocks, because if the position goes against me after I buy in, I know that I will be able to get back out in time. Usually within a few days.

I hope this helps you get some idea about what you could potentially make, and how you might go about picking a good potential stock for trading. Paper trading is only good for practicing entries and exits on your platform of choice. It does nothing for you actually executing when there's real money on the line though. That's why you only trade what you're comfortable losing on any given position.

It's called the geometric mean - essentially its a way to calculate the central tendency and estimate selling distribution. Based on this (this guys here did a calculation https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m9td6w/estimations_for_the_total_payout_of_gme_based_on/), even if it gets to $20M/share (I'm still highly skeptical, buy hey who knows), the highest likely price would be $4T. 

This part I am entirely unsure of, because I don't think this type of event has ever occurred. But from what's been pieced together, this is what I think the chain of events are: When the short seller's debt exceeds their margin, the broker liquidates collateral to settle the debt. When the debt is so high the brokers can't solve the debt, the clearing entities liquidate the brokers. This chain continues all the way up to the DTCC and eventually the Feds. As far as I understand it (and I could be wrong, I'm not an expert on this), the DTCC originally never believed any of its members would run into such a financial shit show. They literally didn't have any mechanisms in place to protect the market from a financial black hole. This is one of the reasons (believed) for the flurry of rules being passed lately. The DTCC's job is to make sure people get their money and the market doesn't shatter, after all.

At the end of the day, the money will have to come from somewhere. Even if that results in money printing from the Fed (hence Dr Burry's prediction of hyperinflation). If GME share holders don't get paid, then it becomes an international fraud issue. And I don't think the US government wants international fraud across hundreds of countries.

This is just my opinion, but if GameStop were to go to a crazy high price where the FED needs to print money, I don’t think the inflation from this event will be that bad. Keep in mind only a few people actually know about how badly shorted GameStop is.

Due to margin I have more buying power. Obviously in the end I need to square up with the broker, but for now I can show up with $25k in cash and purchase $30k worth of stocks and watch them grow. Is it possible to have this $30k amount split between $25k TSLA and $5k penny stocks?"

2021-05-27 10:34:38,stocks,Which stocks do you consider growth stocks? :)
2021-05-27 12:34:21,stocks,"These are great questions! 

I see a huge emphasis being put on energy storage. There are countries that are regularly exceeding their energy demand using renewables but as soon as the sun sets or the wind dies down, they need to ramp up fossil fuel plants again. I see utilities and electrical producers investing heavily in infrastructure to store massive amounts of energy. This could be done through a variety of physical and   
 chemical methods. Additionally, we should expect to see energy prices increase as utilities and energy companies have to start sequestering carbon. My background is in atmospheric chemistry so I've been a lot more amped on the chemical energy storage but physical storage will likely scale better. 

&#x200B;

I have a lot of thoughts about hydrogen. Long story short, it needs a lot more work. On paper, hydrogen fuel cells look game changing but the real world applications are a little trickier. Infrastructure issues behind mass deployment of hydrogen is an issue (see: The Hindenberg) as well as long term durability of fuel cells. Additionally, the most efficient way to get H2 gas is to ""crack"" methane (CH4) or other hydrocarbons. This means there will still be a demand for natural gas extraction (which is very detrimental to our climate and local air quality) in order to power our hydrogen fuel cells. I really, really want to believe in hydrogen but I don't see it beating electric and alternative fueled vehicles in the next decade. Those two sectors have their own set of hurdles to surmount but it'll be a lot easier than hydrogen.

&#x200B;

The two aspects of renewable energy that have gotten me really excited recently are biochemical production of natural gas (e.g. renewable natural gas) and plasma gasification. Using microbes to produce natural gas not only gives us useable natural gas to power infrastructure but it also serves as a method of carbon sequestration. Plasma gasification is using plasma to heat materials so that they release all combustible gases and produce solid carbon and trace metals (which can be disposed of).

They'd have to create an enormous amount of economic value to be worth more than all their competitors combined, like they were earlier in the year. More than nearly any company has ever created without a monopolistic platform business model. I don't see how that's possible for a car company.

Second, yes they are stable. Let's be real, nobody is building any more railroads. Railroads are land owners for the right-of-way the tracks are laid on, asset holding companies for the rails, locomotives and rolling stock, and major freight/intermodal players. Backtested against the SP500, they blow it out of the water over the last 20 years with practically zero risk giving how essential they are to the country.

I'll give ya a quick rundown on the remaining 5 Class I railroads:

BNSF - privately owned by Berkshire Hathaway. I own some BRK.B because of this. Really, really wish they were public. Best of the bunch for US rail, imo.

UNP - largest public US railroad. Covers Western US. They haul everything across the country. Rate of stock gain is 2nd to last, but I can't imagine owning railroads without UNP in there. 

CSX and NSC - East coast/Midwest freight hauling coal/intermodal/commodities. Growing exponentially in terms of value. Good buy

CNI - just merged with KSU (Kansas City Southern) to create the only Canada-US-Mexico point-to-point railroad. Great entry point right now too as they paid so much for KSU that their stock took a 13% drop due to the debt taken on. Until now, rate of stock gain has been slowest of the 5 railroads, but should this merger go through long-term they may be the best hold.

CP - far and away my favorite holding. Their rate of growth is incredible, their financials strong, their leadership the best in the business. They along with CNI are the only Class I railroads in Canada. Their stock regularly takes 8% dips then roars back, so I'd wait for a better entry point or DCA in with a small initial.

Of course, do your own DD, but that's my take from a guy whose been holding these a long time. About 30-40 years ago there were 100s of railroads. Soo Line, Wisconsin Central, etc etc etc. They've all been bought out by these 5, making them stronger and resistant to competition than ever, and thus laws were passed against any more mergers due to monopoly concerns. The CNI-KSU merger is likely the last we will ever see, and it's still no sure thing as the STB (Surface Transportation Board) has not approved it yet as it would make CNI too strong. I consider each of these railroads as akin to Google essentially owning the internet. Nobody is coming for them. 

Lastly, they all recently underwent PSR (Precision Scheduled Railroading) which is a new way of moving freight, instead of going when a unit train is full, they run at set times, regardless of manifest cargo, in order to keep cars moving and customers from waiting. This has enormously cleaned up operations costs and efficiency for all involved, and railroads are now operating in the 21st century with better revenues than ever. 

I wrote much more than I meant to, but I guess I just like trains :)"
2021-05-26 20:53:03,stocks,"you should never use amazon for your research. You look up good shit, then look if its available on amazon, which it probably is"
2021-05-26 21:48:02,stocks,"I've been an avid and very supportive customer of Amazon since 2000. I also order from wholefoods prime now and whatnot. But people here are unfortunately correct: if you try to buy electronics, gloves, a toy, a camera... almost anything really, you'll likely get garbage. It took me some time to realize how much things have changed."
2021-05-27 09:58:21,stocks,TBH I would prefer random ads purely based on the fact that ads work and seeing less targeted ones would make me spend less money.
2021-05-26 21:42:27,stocks,"Completely agree. Now they're getting smarter with names too. I bought a ""Wellue"" oxygen monitor. It said on Amazon that it was made in England. When it arrived, I tried to charge it and it literally fell apart. Once I tried to contact customer service in ""California,"" I realized that they were in Shenzhen. And that they do not take back products that fall apart, of course.  


PS. to edit - I feel bad saying this in a way because I'm friends with three families in China and really love them. But the products on Amazon are really awful."
2021-05-26 20:54:18,stocks,But all those brands are available on amazon? Its the same thing everywhere else and irl. You have to do your research before buying
2021-05-27 11:09:03,stocks,That's an interesting philosophy. My idea is I'm going to spend money anyway. Might as well discover new things I like.

Soo..... take out loan every month for 150,000$ for 2% interest. Short 150,000$ each month and oay 1% borrow rate since it’s super slow dinosaur stock. Wait 12 months. Pocket the 10% free shares, pay off 2% for borrowing and 1% for short borrowing. 7% of 150k per month profit.

2021-05-27 17:04:22,stocks,"Agree.  Someone in their Quality dept either isnt paying attention, or are told to keep their mouth shut unless spoken to (unfortunately, this is the case in many companies).  What Peloton could do is earn ISO 9001 QMS certification, support employee involvement in ASQ & SME, & use these 2 as catalysts to crush their competition."
2021-05-27 17:07:20,stocks,"As a consumer, seems to me Nautilis runs on the separate names (Schwinn, Bowflex, etc) rather than the overall name Nautilis.  Sort of like General Motors"

2021-05-27 16:59:41,stocks,"Getting back to you about $NLS, it looks waay undervalued here, with a P/E <10.  Nautilis can pick up the home gym market of those not willing to spend the $ on Peloton equipment/subscription (this is my case, I have a Schwinn eliptical).  Its riding an upwards price channel at the moment.  Beta is only .89, but this is one to easily buy 100 shares of comfortably & sell a covered call on every month for an extra $50."

The opportunity to short PTON will present itself again.  In the meantime, have to ride the rollercoaster up till it peaks out."
2021-05-27 17:11:17,stocks,"PTON fairly valued at $70.  Below $70, I'll buy it, & im not even a PTON fan."
2021-05-27 00:55:02,stocks,That's awesome to hear. Keep it up 👍
2021-05-27 19:38:41,stocks,INTC is a good play.
2021-05-27 13:29:44,stocks,"AAPL is the best buy amongst mega cap techs. It is now selling at a 15% discount from its recent high and since then has been building a base around this 125-127 level.  The next big move should be up-up-up and all Apple has to do is just keep executing as it is doing.  The Epis lawsuit has been a drag recently, but realistically it is probably nothing more than a temporary PR cloud, the changes of a judge determining what Apple can charge on its platform is nill. The judge in this case has been pressuring Apple to compromise, but to allow unsecure aps to be sold on IOS without going through Apple's strict guidelines would defeat the whole purpose of IOS, that is a much safer place to be that Android or Windows. IOS has only about 1.2% of the malware, Android is around 25% and Windows is up around 35%. So bottomline is Apple is going to stand firm and likely defeat Epic. If they do compromise it will be a slight reduction, no lower than 25% and that won't hurt them much.  At 125 I consider APPL around 50% undervalued with very little downside risk especially since they have 100 billlion allocated for buybacks and love to buy their own stock whenever it does down."
2021-05-27 16:58:11,stocks,I totally agree

2021-05-27 10:45:10,stocks,"Lots of people use oat milk at home already, especially flexitarians that try to consume less animal products without being too strict. Replacing cow milk with oat milk is an easy and effective step. Oatly's cream cheese products are also very decent as a next step once you've learned about the company and agree to their philosophy.  
Germany as a country that supports the milk industry a lot has seen a decrease in cow milk consumption.  
The number of vegans and vegetarians has doubled in one year and they'll influence others around them. So the next step would be for workplaces to replace the common cow milk in their coffee machines with oat milk which hasn't happened yet but if the story goes on like before, it might happen at one point, at least in places with younger employees. 

Changing the milk at coffee machines is quite a hassle so at one point it might be easier to just agree on one type of milk instead of choosing between cow milk, lactose-free, oat milk or even soy milk, every time."

The next big catalyst is the Rivian IPO that should reveal how much Ford owns. I'm still holding $10 calls for 2022 and $20 calls on 2023 that are both up huge, but I'm probably reloading more to catch the Rivian IPO."

Im a little nervous over Apple because if they make any significant announcement any time soon (very doubful) it could really deflate Fords momentum. But on the other hand, Apple itself has been a target of fatigue among investors lately so it would possible Ford would still stand out as ""David"" stock.

As a side note that you didn't ask for in any way, check out UAL. I find them similar to Ford in that they aren't as overhyped and are now bordering on undervalued. Also they still haven't reached prepandemic stock price. The company itself struggled a little more than others during 2020 but I have some theories on why that point to long term recovery.

Gross margins were relatively stable considering the volume decline, with better average selling prices offsetting volume deleveraging,"" Chief Executive Jeff Waters said.

> ""Operating expenses ran higher sequentially, but in line with projections. As we conclude the remaining SunPower separation activities, we expect to bring operating expenses down in the quarters ahead,"" Mr. Waters said.

> Raymond James said in a note, which reiterated its Strong Buy rating, that ""as had been telegraphed in April, cost pressure vis-a-vis glass, cells, and logistics - an industrywide trend - was a noticeable headwind.""

> Maxeon guided for second-quarter shipments of 415 MW to 475 MW and revenue of $165 million to $185 million.

> ""As with the entire value chain, input cost inflation remains a headwind in 2Q,"" Raymond James said in its note.

> ""There is no avoiding the current headwind from input cost inflation ... but history's lesson is that everything in the solar space is fundamentally a commodity, and all bottlenecks are always transitory,"" the analyst note said.

> Raymond James noted that ""SunPower's guidance is even more back-end-weighted than usual,"" which the firm said translates into a stronger second half for Maxeon."
