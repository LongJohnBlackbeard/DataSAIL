2021-04-12 19:50:31,stocks,"Dollar cost averaging ie putting a fixed amount say 20% each month would remove some volatility of the investment and emotionally less worriesome. 

However, there's this research that says that if you have a large sum of money for investment (putting in that lump sum all at once [Vanguard research: Dollar-cost averaging 
just means taking risk later](https://static.twentyoverten.com/5980d16bbfb1c93238ad9c24/rJpQmY8o7/Dollar-Cost-Averaging-Just-Means-Taking-Risk-Later-Vanguard.pdf) yield much better returns than dollar cost averaging.

Specifically that research showed that after a 10 year period, lump ajmp investment is superior to dollar cost averaging around two thirds of the time, and results is consistent across US, UK and Australia."

2021-04-12 19:49:05,stocks,"A better strategy is to gradually cycle out of one asset class (savings account) to another asset class (index funds). Now, the time frame can be of your choosing but a monthly or fortnightly shift is a pretty standard way of arriving at a balanced cost basis."

2021-04-12 19:43:16,stocks,"I‚Äôm betting on the SPDR S&P Retail Index: XRT right now. When things really get going and the pent up demand from retail consumers that have been locked down for a year across the country I feel like this one is going up 25% or more. However, this is not financial advice."
2021-04-12 19:52:22,stocks,"Are you going to need access to this money anytime in the near future? If so, then no. You cannot predict the market. Index funds are a safe bet, but only if you invest over time. It could crash the day you buy in. Of course, it will recover, and eventually surpass your original investment, but it's possible that could take years if that were to happen."

2021-04-12 19:30:33,stocks,Can you explain this strategy a little more I don‚Äôt understand it
2021-04-12 19:54:40,stocks,the tippy top for sure
2021-04-12 19:56:45,stocks,"yes, tradingview, Bloomberg etc or your very own platform should have this feature"
2021-04-12 19:12:01,stocks,"In general I first look for themes. When I find a theme I start looking at the sector/market. Identify the players, both public and private and proceed to eliminate targets, select ones that are at first glance interesting. When you finally find 1 or more start looking at their finances, management, opinion of whatever stakeholders and on and on and finally have a target:s that fits your theme and isn‚Äôt a bad investment, start buying in blocks, average up or down over time so you don‚Äôt go all in at once. 

As for losing money, even the best investments can behave badly at times. If you did your homework however, if and when it does do perform badly you can ask yourself simply ‚Äúhas the story changed?‚Äù Did the theme fall apart? If not, did the company change in a way it cannot fulfill the theme? If not, buy more. Is it a long term investment then let me tell you a secret to success, you always want to buy something good at a discount, so buy more because if the fundamentals are there then eventually it will work out. You can always eliminate any stocks if you feel they have too much debt to further minimize your risk.

But do diversify, because there are always ‚Äúacts of god‚Äù Now if you have 10 great investments or themes anyway, you should be fine even with pandemics and whatever, by diversification I mean try to have as little correlation between them as possible, don‚Äôt go buying all the FAANG or all a bunch of different EV stocks. Be creative and you should have no problem finding more than 1 theme.

And if you intend to spend a lot of time picking individual stocks then I suggest you build up a library of resources for your DD. From links to SEC, news, ratings, financial data, fund institutional trackers, review sites, pedias, whatever that helps!"
2021-04-12 19:57:34,stocks,"Ben Graham suggested in The Intelligent Investor to use the S&P stock guide, go down the list of companies, and filter out options based on the last column of values at the time: P/E ratio. Nowadays you can use a stock screener.

My methods are, loosely: 

-Get idea about company or sector

-Investigate on Yahoo and Fidelity the basic valuations of the companies in the sector I'm interested in

-If this superficial analysis suggests further analysis, I grab the last 5 years of quarterly reports and tabulate income statements, balance sheets, and cash flows in Excel. I also grab 1 or 2 top competitors for reference.

-Analyze the data. If the company looks undervalued, I try to go about guessing what I figure it ought to be worth with three guesses: A pessimistic guess, and optimistic guess, and a conservative guess. If the guesses suggest minimal risk and a worthwhile potential for gains, I make a decision from there."

2021-04-12 19:21:09,stocks,Attention should be paid to patient‚Äôs renal function and to the transition phase from ketogenic diet to a normal diet that should be gradual and well controlled. The duration of ketogenic diet may range from a minimum (to induce the physiological ketosis) of 2‚Äì3 weeks to a maximum (following a general precautionary principle) of many months (6‚Äì12  months). Correctly understood the ketogenic diet can be a useful tool to treat obesity.
2021-04-12 18:49:58,stocks,"I tried it while going to school as a way to grow my smaller account and I tried buying calls, selling put credit spreads (you don‚Äôt need a lot of money for those) and I lost way more than I gained. Tried it for about 6 months"
2021-04-12 19:47:50,stocks,Deep in the money leaps. Around approx half the price of the stock you get very little extrinsic value and therefore its almost like owning the stock but at a 2x leverage.
2021-04-12 18:49:54,stocks,Consider CSPs if you‚Äôre looking for income or even deep ITM calls to exploit leverage rather than playing the lotto

2021-04-12 19:04:26,stocks,"Cash secured put, like you mentioned collateral is an issue but with your account size, there are plenty of attractive stocks you have collateral for, look up the wheel strategy. LEAPs are fine and good if you‚Äôre bullish but you can achieve sizeable growth with less risk elsewhere. Make sure you are familiar with the Greeks before doing any option investing though."
2021-04-12 19:25:07,stocks,"I know very little about options, haven't fully dived in yet. Been thinking about building a long position that could allow me to sell Covered Calls"
2021-04-12 19:42:06,stocks,"You might want to start with CSPs if you‚Äôre capable of buying 100 shares of a stock in order to sell covered calls. Again, look up the wheel. And PLEASE read up on the Greeks and IV before doing any trades."

2021-04-12 18:51:24,stocks,We are getting quantum computers before graphene chips. The labour and time it takes to make graphene chips makes me doubt we'll see them.
2021-04-12 19:48:32,stocks,"I would say don't. But if you really want to then just know what you are buying there are companies that make grapheme deposit semiconductor equipment (AIXTRON) and there are companies that make grapheme enhanced golf clubs and fishing rods (Applied Graphene Materials). There are also many BS companies that will never go anywhere so again you must be very diligent with your research. Also, if you are from US then you might want to open EU broker account as the best listed graphene companies are listed on European markets.

I've been in this space for while but it is still very nascent and I realised that I'm unlikely to make any money so sold everything and never looked back. Too speculative for me."
2021-04-12 19:51:03,stocks,"NNXPF is my pick, and I‚Äôve studied them fairly intensively at this point.   Wait to buy in the low to mid $2‚Äôs, it‚Äôs not very liquid right now so be careful and plan to hold it for a while.   Been holding this one since the $1 range."
2021-04-12 18:36:41,stocks,You really think it‚Äôs going to be that far out before it really takes hold in all the markets. I mean it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt seem to far off that it‚Äôs used in all solar panels and batteries. Maybe a couple years.
2021-04-12 19:14:56,stocks,What about graphene batteries and solar panels etc. power use items not necessarily pc products.
2021-04-12 18:48:25,stocks,"Depends on what you mean by graphene, the miracle promised by application, production and scalability, then absolutely more than a few years and impossible to know who to invest in. Now if you wanted to say invest in quantum computing I would recommend google alphabet, they are a far into the development but if it doesn‚Äôt work out, we won‚Äôt know for years, it‚Äôs google, quantum computing isn‚Äôt priced in at all. If you follow me. Perhaps something like Samsung, an ETF for large cap Korean companies even or chemicals like Cabot. But don‚Äôt chase graphene."

2021-04-12 18:29:13,stocks,"I think we're nearing a peak right now and would wait until the end of the year. JPOW has already said that the economy is correcting at insanely fast speeds- the more quickly the economy recovers the more likely the Fed will raise rates earlier than anticipated.


There's nothing wrong with sitting on the sidelines just to be extra careful here. 2% inflation is really nothing, a lot of people pay more than 2% of their portfolio in fees to their broker in a year. 

More money has been lost by FOMO than by sitting on the sidelines."

2021-04-12 17:52:25,stocks,"The thing that alot of people don't realise is when such a market crash occurs, the value of your currency (whether it is invested or not) is diminished with it. Even if you pulled out and went straight cash to avoid a loss, you would still be seeing the value of your cash depreciate and thus taking a loss. To think of it in terms of a bigger picture, those who lost a tremendous portion of their savings (within the stock market) in 2008 were almost entirely recovered by 2010, and making considerable gains along with the market by 2011, 2012, and so on. It is very hard to see in the moment, but if you take the value of any portfolio at its peak in 2007, and you compare it to that same portfolio a few years later, you will see a massive return regardless of what happened in 2008, 2009, etc."

For all intents and purposes as an investor holding bags for a 30+ year time frame is virtually the same as ""never recovering"".

Additionally, if the nikkei traded laterally for the next 1000 years it doesnt mean Japanese society will crumble. Japan has been doing perfectly fine over the past 30 years even if the stock market is down. Quality of living has gone up"

2021-04-12 19:10:43,stocks,"Right now, APHA is at 81% of TLRY trading below the 83% merger agreement. I would wait to see if APHA continues to drop and the % difference increases. If tomorrow APHA IS 79%, 80% or lower of TLRY I would average down APHA. If they both correct and APHA goes back to 83% then average down your TLRY. You won't be able to time the time perfect buy in. So if you see an opportunity that makes sense, take it. 

But you Have plenty of time to average down on TLRY. Buying in to APHA when lower than 83% of TLRY is not something that will last very long since the merger is coming up."

As long as you have enough patience to hold through the dips and come out the other end,  you more than double the performance eventually.

2021-04-12 19:14:19,stocks,Interesting. This might work. Especially if you could devise a good quantitative rule for what it means for volatility to calm down.
2021-04-12 17:54:19,stocks,a real crash is unrecoverable
2021-04-12 16:58:50,stocks,"TQQQ hasn't existed for a real crash, like 2000 or 2008. It might not be recovered from those even today if it had. 2018 was small, and 2020 was followed by the craziest tech bull market ever. If you look at both of those drops, though, it took TQQQ longer than QQQ to recover. What if recovery of the market in general hadn't been as quick?"
2021-04-12 17:02:28,stocks,"Huh, I had never even heard of that. Did a quick Google search. Is QLD a 2x leveraged QQQ? I guess if people want leverage, they want all the leverage?"
2021-04-12 19:19:40,stocks,"Here's the other post I was referencing:

>Wouldn‚Äôt a simple stop loss remove most of this extreme downside risk? It‚Äôs not an unreasonable assumption that tech is never going to crater to nothing in a single day. You very likely could already be way up on a position before, let‚Äôs say, a 20% stop loss kicks in. Because of the nature of these leveraged funds being based on single day qqq performance, one could just recognize volatility is still high after their stop loss kicks in and choose to wait till it cools off before entering again.  It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre missing out on gains since tomorrow is only what matters on these funds.

>After watching what happened to my leveraged position in spring 2020 and holding I plan to do this going forward. If the VIX is trending up and TQQQ is trending down I plan to sell my position and wait till TQQQ is trending up and the VIX has normalized. Trends coming from positive/negative weekly MACD values. I keep 20% of my Roth in UPRO/TQQQ. Probably due for a rebalance since it‚Äôs approaching 30% with all the gains even from starting in January 2020, but it‚Äôs hard not to be greedy üòÇ. Would love to see a back test using this method.

2021-04-12 17:02:20,stocks,Tqqq returns on the recovery have been better than qqq for both drops. So really the concern is just what would happen if you held it through a real crash. Would be interesting to see the backtesting on holding tqqq through 2008
2021-04-12 17:09:12,stocks,Yeah it seems weird. I've been tempted to do QLD and SSO (2x of SP500). But it just seems like the only two you ever hear about are 3x leverage or straight QQQ/VOO
2021-04-12 17:04:35,stocks,"Right. If you happened to be a genius and bought TQQQ at the bottom of the crash, you're golden. As long as you sell before the next one. If you bought right before the crash, I'm pretty sure you're broke forever."
2021-04-12 17:11:51,stocks,"There are also other daily settlement ‚Äòfrictional losses‚Äô, the TQQQ history charts are not what your holdings would look like. There are actual leveraged etf calculators out there that show you the real hypothetical numbers if you‚Äôre curious. I just got into this a couple weeks ago on TQQQ and was playing with numbers, so thought I would mention. Also the SEC did a special public notice paper on these because they are so exotic and hard to calculate overtime. It‚Äôs out there on the google somewhere."

2021-04-12 17:43:00,stocks,"Oh my sweet summer child, 2018 wasn‚Äôt a bear market.

If you want to see what happens during an actual bear market, use the 2000 Nasdaq return of -36.8%, 2001 returns of -32.6%, 2002 returns of -37.6% (yes, QQQ would have had 3 conservative years of negative 30+% returns) or 2008 returns of -41.9%. Multiply any one of those years by 3 to get a rough estimate of the TQQQ return."
2021-04-12 16:49:19,stocks,"TQQQ hasn't been around this long, but if it had been there for a real crash, like 2000, it probably still wouldn't be recovered today."

2021-04-12 17:26:45,stocks,"I hold a portion of UPRO to supplement/supercharge my standard SPY investments.  I expect UPRO to have a great run over the next year or two.  

If you‚Äôre going all in on a 3x, I would stick with UPRO over TQQQ since it‚Äôs more diversified... S&P500 was essentially unaffected by the huge/quick rotation out of tech, despite a significant proportion of it being tech (because other sectors benefited from the shift in equity)."
2021-04-12 16:30:52,stocks,"If you can stomach 96% drops in the market then you‚Äôll be golden with TQQQ or UPRO.

I saw the math for something like this. But.

If you start with 1000$ with QQQ and invest like 100$ every month you‚Äôd have a gain of like 1,400% in ten years.

But with TQQQ same scenario you‚Äôd be up 14,900%.
(If the market is up at that time) 

Personally I invest this strategy with UPRO. I‚Äôm 19 years old so my logic is if I let it sit for 30 years it will not matter if the stock drops 90%. I‚Äôll just delete my brokerage account for those years. in 30 years I‚Äôll be hella rich if I keep investing."

2021-04-12 16:28:15,stocks,I think I have about 10% of my portfolio  as cash. Probably should be more though since market is so crazy atm. Obviously you should any go with what you feel comfortable with. Dont  follow someone else's guidance if it doesnt fit with your monthly/yearly budget
2021-04-12 16:16:23,stocks,Depends
2021-04-12 16:26:31,stocks,"It definitely depends who you are, what your situation is and what you're comfortable with. For me personally‚ÄîI like to have my emergency fund be all cash. This means I have enough on-hand to immediately pay for something that comes up, and the rest of my savings can be in investments."
2021-04-12 16:26:14,stocks,"Rule of thumb is to keep 3-6 months of expenses in cash, if you can afford to."
2021-04-12 17:08:10,stocks,"Ideally, I try to keep around 10% in cash so I can have something to make the most of during a downturn. I‚Äôd say 5-20% is where you want to be at depending on your philosophy and situation."
2021-04-12 16:27:16,stocks,You have cash in your account? Doing better than I am lately. Is it cash or margin account?
2021-04-12 18:24:14,stocks,"You hold 10% in a market that is safe then you build your cash up to 30% then when March 2020 comes and all your stocks drop 20% you buy more stocks with 10%.

then in April the market go's more red so you buy more if your stocks at a discount and throw the other 20% at the market and hold your positions the next time you get payed in May the market is starting to recover so you take say ¬£300 of your salary and hold it as cash for the next dip 2% then the next month 2% total 4% now your on the way back to 10% cash when the market has recovered in say June 2020 like it did you can sell some of the extra stocks you bought at a discount and turn them back into cash for next crash,  now your back to 30% in april 2021 as the market could drop big time and with 30% you are in a good position if that happens 

If you find that the market will go up and up and you see no crash in June 2021 you can buy more stocks and take the cash down as low as 10%"

@elite - I‚Äôm relatively new as well but I‚Äôve learned that aside from emergency money, you don‚Äôt want too much cash sitting. Especially with inflation you are literally loosing money as it sits. I would argue that you should question your investments and sell to buy other opportunities. All depends if you want to day trade or long term invest. Either way due diligence is the key.

I‚Äôm sure there are calculators to determine your average, but I‚Äôm not sure what they are as I haven‚Äôt used them. To manually calculate your average you need to know each trade you made (cost/share and # shares purchased). 

In your example you have: 
50 shares @ 2.36 = $118 
plus your new trade (let‚Äôs say 50 shares @ $1.78)

So,
Total shares = 100 shares;  
Total cost basis = $207;

2021-04-12 15:11:49,stocks,"If it were possible to do this without investing much time or effort then everybody would be successful swing traders.

Pick a stock you like, for swing trading I usually like smaller cap stocks with relatively low shares issued, on a moderate upwards trend for the past 3 weeks.   Then assess the technicals around support and resistance, identify any channels you want to try to trade, then wait for your entry and enter.   Set your exit and stop loss when you enter using a bracket OCO.  Focus on losing less money per trade gone wrong, and use trailing stops if you see it going your way and it has potential to clear your originally planned price target.

A good candidate to start with might be BP, because all the smaller cap stuff has been blood red for weeks now.  It‚Äôs been trending generally green with good swings, but has a lot of shares issued and is obviously large cap.   Relatively safe to learn on.

You also need to identify which type of trades you‚Äôd like to focus on...  broadly you can trade momentum (using technical indicators), sentiment, or news and events.   This will help narrow the stock picks for you.   With q1 earnings coming out soon and it being a pretty red day in small cap you probably have a decent entry point.

Another easy one to swing trade is CRSR, very cyclical in nature though it‚Äôs been dropping off lately towards red.   You can make money swing trading a downturn but if you mess up you can‚Äôt hold and wait to recover."
2021-04-12 19:31:02,stocks,"To answer your main question, no, it's not a very good idea. It really doesn't make sense to sell a stock on Friday and then buy the same stock again on Monday, as opposed to just holding it long. I feel like you'd lose money the vast majority of the time; not to mention you'd have to worry about wash sales and pattern day trading violations.

If you actually want to gamble $50 on a weekly basis, trade weekly options contracts or leveraged ETFs. Higher risk, for sure, but you said you don't care if you lose it all, and this would give you a better chance of a return than trying to swing trade the same stock every week.

If you just want to experiment and learn, paper trade."

I'll share my thoughts on my portfolio and it may give you some clarity or something you'd like to hear.

I am not thinking of selling anytime soon any of them. The gene editing stocks are a 10+ year hold. Palantir will be the new world order(joking, but I do think it will take over in the future.) MAXN is a newer solar spin off with abysmal financials so I'll wait until they look better, Solar is poised to grow very well in the coming years. FUBO is a gamble, i'll be completely honest. APPH is a cool company and I would like to see where it goes. Only down about 7% on APPH, and don't have so much that it doesn't worry me.

On WKHS I would say sell, but I'm biased towards HYLN. I do personally think that out of TSLA(hardly focuses on this sector), WKHS, HYLN, NKLA and other competitors in the trucking industry, that HYLN will be the winner because of their great battery tech and recent partnerships. I think WKHS entire shtick was hoping that a few contracts would go through, and they didn't, so now the stock is a bust and will likely never recover. But I don't know much about workhorse."

2021-04-12 16:18:28,stocks,"I would largely sell and buy something more solid.

That‚Äôs a collection of very volatile stocks, they can go up or down fast, so if you sell you might see them jump afterwards and regret it.

On the other hand if the market sees another correction like the NASDAQ had recently - and it will before end of summer, if not much earlier, or much worse, if you ask me - they will get crushed ever more. And they are currently trending down right?

If some SPAC you hold is back to the 10$ offering price, the downside is limited and you can hold it in hope they gain announcing a merger.
Consider the opportunity cost, and that the market is so glutted with SPACs many of them will fail to find a company to merge with, and others will settle for some crap business just to be done, and in the end the market may be fed up and not care anyway.

Maybe trim the rest, hold a small position to recoup some losses if they rebound.

Definitely, that kind of speculative and unpredictable stuff *should not be a sizable percentage of your long term portfolio*. Unless it‚Äôs gambling money."

or did you have faith in the companies long term, and now suddenly you think they‚Äôre going to fail just because it‚Äôs a cheaper buy than it was a mere couple weeks ago? In which case what the hell is your logic? 

Sorry if this is harsh mate but trying to give you some tough love here, you need to have a plan before entering into these investments, you need to decide what you value the company for and WHY you‚Äôre buying them, and stick to it.

2021-04-12 14:09:11,stocks,"Many thanks.. Bought many many small portions (like 0.2% of total portfolio) on many different companies.  Did not have time to research each of them and - frankly - given the lack of transparency in many cases (see Canoo ""business plan"" or CLOVER) I do not think it would have made any difference.. The EVs, Bio and RES are a smal portion of my portfolio and it is money I can afford to lose. 

Yet, it is very annoying to see the market go up and these shares stay low. And if they cannot make it now that conditions are good (they had their run during 2020, but I bought them in February), then they may fall even further. Moreover, I wonder if for the same risk level I could have some better alternatives..

On your question of what has changed: 

1. I lost some confidence on SPACs and other small stocks.. 

2. They look like they were pump and dump and not actual market interest

3. I am worried about the overall market position (too high) and these stocks will be decimated..

I had some of these concerns when I bought, but now maybe I am very near the tipping point. And I wonder if there are better opportunities to invest my money for this level of risk."

2021-04-12 15:11:46,stocks,"I don‚Äôt have any biotech stocks atm. It‚Äôs a difficult space to navigate. It‚Äôs not true for all biotechs, but the space is still so new that a lot of them are ‚Äúone trick wonders‚Äù. If whatever they do works they make big stacks, if it doesn‚Äôt, the company is worthless. They are essentially gambles. I‚Äôm not a fan of sector ETF‚Äôs in general, so I can‚Äôt say anything valuable about biotech ETFs.

EV‚Äôs are going to happen eventually, but once they are done growing, and have taken over the car industry, they will be valued just like any other car company, because every car company will be an EV company. Their profit potential won‚Äôt increase just because the cars are electric. Traditional car manufacturers also have a huge advantage over all the new EV companies, when it comes to manufacturing and distributing EV‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs money to be made in that sector. Not at current prices.

As long as you are paying a reasonable price (check their cash flows) it‚Äôs hard to go wrong with healthcare."
2021-04-12 14:49:52,stocks,"If you don‚Äôt think a stock will provide you with a proper return over a 5 or 10 year period, you clearly can‚Äôt count on it to provide a proper return over the next 6 months. You will just end up trying to time the exit with everyone else, and such it isn‚Äôt a sound investment. Even if you buy a cyclical trying to play the cycles you shouldn‚Äôt buy it unless you think it can last for at least another 10 years, otherwise you run the risk that their potential is lost before the cycle turns. So even an investment made with a short term mindset, needs have the potential to be a long term investment as well."

But I could've bought much more for the same price if my timing was better.

I don't get why you talk about ""investing at ATH"" and start your topic AFTER a crash happened. If the correction, dip or whatever you want to call it already happened you're no longer at ATH by definition."

Seeing it rise is much more for aesthetics, emotion, and signs of comfort. Of course that time, I'll admit since I had lots of cash laying around, it almost definitely helped a lot, can only imagine people that depleted cash right before, hence why balance is so important, and having some cash will almost always be king!"

2021-04-12 19:07:42,stocks,"Investing in overall market at ATH is not the best idea, but you want to tell me redditors have better ideas ?

Other case scenarios can be a lot worse.

**Scenario 1 - not investing.**

People are either scared or whatever reason, they don't invest, but can they reliably predict that this is the right choice to do ? Because i remember extreme amount of doomsday posts last March and every single market dip ever since. 

So going on assumption that pretty much near 100% can't predict shit, the next crash could be another 12 years away, and people would not gain experience, knowledge, participation in investing. If market doubled this year, there is going to be shit ton of regrets.

People that doesn't invest now are less likely to invest when it crashes, i gotta remind when market goes down so hugely the sentiment and feeling towards it is a lot worse than ever before, feeling is that market is apocalyptic and the end is near. Compare what people thought of pandemic and economic ramifications in its first days, and what we think about Chinese flu right now.

Even with 2008 the economical consequences were so dire that people screamed next 10 years for stocks being overvalued, not investing in the ride themselves.

**Scenario 2 - buying high, selling low -** [https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/the-psychology-of-buying-high-and-selling-low/](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/the-psychology-of-buying-high-and-selling-low/)

It should be practically considered human nature by this point, especially on reddit people that bought GME, AMC, Nokia, Blackberry, Palantir, Nio at their peak are more than i can count.

People will always be sitting on sidelines like the post said, and when they finally feel like investing for sure, all the ''this is a longterm investment with huge upside in future'' talk, they are most likely to do it at peak. 

Then they are most likely to be stressed over the color red and sell it all for a lose or barely unload their bags in next peak that wasn't as high and rinse and repeat to the next hype stock.

Unspoken truth is that breaking this habit, and actually successful investing can feel opposite from amazing, for a time being when i make such an investment i feel like utter dog shit, i feel completely worthless and devastated. Creeping thoughts on what am i doing, market is at all time high, i am invested in stupid ass dreams and if it really crashes or takes a correction i am completely fucked, i am more than fucked, i am screwed with no return, i won't be able to look my family and friends in the eyes.

Investing in meme stocks at their peaks felt great, so much chatter, so much positivity. I am going through this right now, SPY is consistently ATH yet i recently made investments in bio genetic stocks, that are very low from their peaks and still consistently dropping with floor being the only stop to it. I mean my whole portfolio and picture is doing   
really great yet i am in huge and serious depression that smothers my ability to live normally. Funny thing is that when they were at their peak 100% higher than they are now, i was really compelled to invest in them.

So by end of the day advice about worst market timer Bob which was in the link is not really a bad advice, if it goes against peoples guts, maybe there is a reason for that."

Buying good companies at discount is still a great idea. Don't just buy and get hang on one of them, buy every single one you see on serious discount.

I bought Nvidia, AMD and Amazon at September tech discount, the returns they have given me have not disappointed at all, consistently looking at green in portfolio boosts happiness as well.

On top of that with not stopping with only one purchase even if AMD is doing stale, Nvidia just popped off and is making me some serious money."

   The bankers are pushing ua into this war becauae China is threatening their stranglehold.
   Iraq War..Afghan War...fought against a nation devastated by a decade of sanctions with a depleted military that didnt want to fight.  Afghan war we bombed a rag tag militia...and now we are negotiating with them.  We have foughf 3rd rate militaries and in some cases simply armed groups since WW2 and it hasn't worked out well.  WW2 we fought a major adversary...but 80% of German casualties were caused by the Soviets.  So that leaves the other 20% divided between US, brits, aussies, canadians, French, ect.  
   My point is that China has the will and the ability to defend itself and to do so spectacularly.  Our military has not faced a peer for 80 years.  And the last 30 years of fighting against adversaries that had no chance whatsoever...well any service member will be ill prepared mentally for what they will experience.
  A war with China will devastate the financial markets as the world is so interconnected...and will devestate the US in particular.  Americas power in the world would be drastically reduced and more importantly..it would savage us financially.  Very bad in the long run.  Short term buying puts on the overall market would be the only logical play.  This is a financial nightmare scenario..not an opportunity."

2021-04-12 13:46:34,stocks,"A leveraged drop is greater than a leveraged rise. For instance, say you have $1,000. In one week you lose 25%. Now you have $750. The next week, you gain 30%. Now you have more money than you started with, right? No. That‚Äôs not how percentages work. Now you still only have $975 after a 30% gain. So the 3x leverage is going to amplify the losses. Holding long term is not a good idea"

2021-04-12 15:36:58,stocks,"Be VERY careful with leveraged assets, whether it be leveraged ETFs or options. This can go tits up for you. I have a watch list of leveraged ETFs, and they‚Äôre all either inverse ETFs or volatility ETFs. You typically don‚Äôt stay in these longer than a day.  Many use derivatives that decay rapidly. 

Long term, you‚Äôre better off looking at things like VOO, VUG, VTI, and similar. They don‚Äôt have to be Vanguard funds, but diversified assets tracking an index or an industry can be helpful. I also hold and have done well with VIS and FIDU, but I am a bit biased towards industrials and skeptical or many tech companies, especially ones that have been part of this ‚Äúbandwagon‚Äù game.  I‚Äôm also a cheap ass and like low expense ratios."

QQQ 22 Dec 2017 I buy $1000 worth, 157.37. 1000/157.37= 6 Shares X  336.16(Current price)= $2016.96

2021-04-12 16:05:49,stocks,"Can you expand what using derivatives with decay does to a stock? 

Like how it effects the stock during big drops or gains in price ? 

Do you mean the calculus definition of derivatives or do investors use the word differently?"
2021-04-12 14:16:24,stocks,"You‚Äôre right.  But the problem is a scenario in which we go into a bear or stale market for long term, will one have the patience to hold through?  For example, you have $1000 in QQQ, then it drops 25%, to $750. But you see another stock is down 50% and believe it is oversold. You sell $750 of the QQQ and buy that stock in which it goes up 50%.

With TQQQ, you have $1000 and it drops to $250 instead. You definitely can‚Äôt sell it now for that other stock you want because your TQQQ holding is so low. You basically will lose opportunity during bear moments."
2021-04-12 13:59:33,stocks,"This may be true, but we‚Äôve also seen an extremely rapid growth in the Nasdaq. I don‚Äôt believe this type of growth will be sustained. Generally, the market grinds up slowly but surely, not the wild swings we‚Äôve been seeing and the rockets upward. In my opinion, the market is highly overvalued but will still keep going up short term, but this would be a terrible time to buy TQQQ. Just my 2 cents, not investment advice üëç"
2021-04-12 16:14:50,stocks,"Youre thinking of leverage.
If QQQ goes up 1.0, TQQQ goes up 3.0 and vice versa. But because TQQQ uses options to achieve this goal (EACH DAY, not long term) there is something called theta decay. Over time, options become worth less money (oversimplifying).  I would recommend not holding a leveraged ETF if I‚Äôm speaking a foreign language right now."
2021-04-12 14:21:57,stocks,"What about this. I buy QQQ, and it drops 25% to $750. Sell it Then I jump to TQQQ and ride it up, when I feel like it I will go back to QQQ when the ride up is done. Will that be a better option?"
2021-04-12 14:06:33,stocks,Agreed. Best way to play TQQQ is to buy during big dips to catch the leverage upon recovery and sell.
2021-04-12 16:22:26,stocks,"I‚Äôm just researching right now, and I know what options and leverage are but I have no clue how options could be used to leverage a stock

2021-04-12 13:13:31,stocks,I‚Äôm not too well versed in these things but why is a company with 169k in revenue even doing an IPO?
2021-04-12 15:51:52,stocks,"Big no from me.

If they went public 6 months ago it could have been a nice fast speculation. Now the market is cooling off to random IPOs with little substance.

About this specific company, at a glance investors would be paying an estimated 9 millions for ‚Ä¶ a website. That‚Äôs losing money. That has no following I‚Äôm aware of. No moat, nothing unique going for it.
Just a promise that they will *try* to develop some kind of IP property that will give them a hedge in the business of esports betting. Note they don‚Äôt have the technology, they will try to develop it with your money.

That‚Äôs way too little. I get the impression that is too easy for a thousand more startups offering the same services to pop up, it doesn‚Äôt take a lot of funding and expertise.
In fact, they start with a disvantage compared to estabilished betting or gaming platforms that already have a bigger user base.

If and when esport betting takes off, there will be consolidation with few winners and lots of losers. Absolutely not worth it."

2021-04-12 14:06:16,stocks,My stocks used to be green most of the time. Same stocks now pretty much consistently red. Nothings changed with the companies. Shits just like that.
2021-04-12 15:21:07,stocks,"Advice can also be different for traders vs investors. I‚Äôm a cheap ass. I want to just pay the long term capital gains rates. Only one of my picks has the real potential to not be around in a year, and that‚Äôs still unlikely to occur.  The stock market serves the opposite role as a bank in a sense. You‚Äôre risking money you could lose with the hopes of getting a return on your investment, whereas your bank account is the safe store of your money with extremely low risk and almost no return to speak of.  Don‚Äôt invest money you can‚Äôt afford to lose; save it instead. 

I bought one stock, not realizing I was near the ATH. I thought it was headed higher.  I then had to average down a few shares on low days. It sat there for months trading between $265 and $305 while I had to average down from around a $330 basis. Finally, company actions and some luck came into play. Now trading around $340 for my $310 (averaged down) basis, and I‚Äôm seeing green after months.   

For others where the price can be down but not out, you might sell while you can when it‚Äôs really taking a haircut and buy back lower. If you average down something bought really high on a pump, like meme stocks, you‚Äôre going to have to buy a lot more at a lot lower price to get back to a sane cost basis.  I bought one meme stock on pure impulse, rode the price up, tried to time it, fucked that up, and sold at a loss. It could have come back up, but I knew the price was unrealistic to begin with and didn‚Äôt feel like holding on to see if lighting would strike twice.  I made up those losses that I could afford with a couple of months of good choices."
2021-04-12 16:32:53,stocks,"Also,  what ever happened to blue chip stocks? I have a bunch of those and guess what, they are doing fine. Chill people chill and be selective into what you invest in. Finally, set a stop loss."

You come here and think you'll never make money because ""the market is overvalued, we are in a japan bubble, I'm predicted a crash"" posts.

2021-04-12 16:37:14,stocks,"I've specifically made it a point the past month to agressively rebalance my portfolio to be less taken up by crud that's hyped to the moon that I know jack about and more with companies and ETFs with stable and reputable business patterns and/or track records that I am actually confident in for a long time horizon and it's given me SO MUCH better state of mine. Now a red day like this doesn't bother me as much as I am more confident in the majority of my picks eventually going back up later. 

I started my personal long portfolio in early February and at one point I was down 500 bucks on my intial 6-7k investment. After some rebalancing and staying the course with my confident picks, I am now down just 200 bucks and I am still at work mitigating the whacky stuff I probably shouldn't have bought and beefing up my stable long positions. 

Speculating is fun when done reasonably, but more often than not well thought out investing long term wins the day."
2021-04-12 15:08:11,stocks,"Just incrementally invest in companies you believe in for the long-term, or if you can't stomach the volatility some (especially tech, biotech) stocks can experience go for an ETF. Do this only with money you don't necessarily need straight away. Sure you can find short-term success but you are just as likely to buy into a stock before a shortterm downwards trend. investing long-term has been proven to be the best bet especially for retail investors.

Edit: people tend to get pessimestic when their stocks go down but forget that the whole basis of the stock market is stocks reaching ATHs, pulling back and then reaching new ATHs. Not for every company, ofcourse, but generally this applies. This is also not a proces that takes days, it can take multiple months or even years."

You're probably using a benchmark index like SPY/ VTI. Because they're larger indices you're not going to see the rotation from growth to energy/value/ cash flow positive companies. They have for the most part balanced themselves out within the funds.  

I personally have a mix of total market funds as well as growth. My growth has been hammered this year while VTI has buoyed the portfolio (somewhat) from sinking. I'm down maybe 6% this year and 103% last year. I'm not going to complain about a strategy I know has more risk and volatility. 

Other thing to point out is a lot of people are not using retirement funds and instead likely brokerage apps like webull and robinhood.

EDIT: up 103% not down sorry"

2021-04-12 18:15:14,stocks,"Fair enough... But depending on the exact shape of the graph, you may have made *more* by selling at a loss and throwing it into something boring like VTI.  If it lost 80% and then went up 550%, you were certainly right to hold.  But if it just stayed relatively flat for 2 years and recently went up 30%, you'd have done better taking the loss years ago and throwing it in an index fund.  

I know, hindsight is perfect.  I may just be hung up on the world's stubborn insistence to compare everything to letting it sit as cash rather than use a more useful metric that could account for opportunity cost."
2021-04-12 17:58:09,stocks,"But you should still jump out if the fundamentals changed it to a loser. I think it's good advice to at least accept you might need to cut your loses. 

The final total of your portfolio doesn't care what your individual holdings are. You can wait for a losing stock to get back to $0 or turn a profit, but if you believe in the growth of something else more, it's actually better to cut the loss and put that money to work differently.

2021-04-12 17:32:28,stocks,"Last decade was an anomoly.  Historically small cap has had higher returns than large cap, and value has higher returns than growth.

With the increasingly high valuations and high price to earnings ratios on large cap growth stocks, it may be setting a period for small cap value over-performance.

Growth/value has been cyclical. For example, in the 90's, growth outperformed as investors rushed into tech stocks that seemed like the future. But after the turn of the century, value outperformed as it was more resistant to the bubble crashing. However, due to an over-correction in tech, growth was then in a position to outperform in the 10's.

Factors are important when deciding on an active trading strategy."

If you stick to broad index funds like VTI, funds that track the S&P 500, you‚Äôre not ‚Äúrisking it all‚Äù‚Äîhistorically, a drop of 30-50% is the worst it‚Äôs gotten, and markets have bounced back in a decade or less.

On the flip side, the market has gone up on average 10% a year over the last century. There will be down years and flat years, but historically, businesses have grown, peoples lives have improved, economies have stabilized and innovation has consistently driven growth. Betting on the future has always been a winning bet in the long term. 

If you‚Äôre very conservative, follow the rules for a retiree portfolio‚Äîfocus on income, mostly bonds and safe dividend stocks/ETFs. The return won‚Äôt be as high but the downside from a bad event will be less.

Second, do an exercise where you decide how much money you would want to have access to in 5 years and in 10 years. Put the 10 year money into a broad index ETF, VOO or VTI are good choices. Using SPY as a benchmark, there is no 10 year period where you would end with less money then you started.

Put the 5 year money into a more conservative fund, maybe VBTLX. This money is unlikely to grow as quickly as equity funds, but should move differently and have less volatility. 

Now you have a diversified account, with an emergency fund, and a balanced investment approach. Remember, you can't predict what the market is going to do, so don't try. Just trust the process. 

For reference, SPY is up 30% in the last 10 months. Your 130k would be 170k. Don't miss out on the next 40k"

I also tell myself that cash is trash if it's sitting in my bank account. If I have nothing to use my cash on, I might as well put it in assets.

2. If you are afraid of a market crash, hedge your bets. Set a timeline and criteria which convince you to enter or to exit any stock, any mutual fund, any ETF, or the market as a whole.
3. For example, You could invest 1/2 of your $ in the market and hold the rest in fear, short term, of a market correction, and buy when the market is 20% down. 
4. If you want to invest safe, Mutual funds or ETFs are the way to go.
5. It is also possible to be your own stock picker. Peter Lynch, one of the all time most reliable mutual fund managers, suggests more people do this at least in conjunction with mutual funds.
6. Research your investments. Peter Lynch did well by researching companies and markets, finding out which companies were profitable, had an edge, and were expanding.
7. It is entirely possible to just start a ""paper account"" where you invest your money in mutual funds (FBGRX is one I like, for example, but there are many other high quality ones) but then simulate your own picks, and see how your picks would do over a year or two vs. the mutual fund. Then, with a year or two of learning and experience, you will have the experience and the confidence to tell better companies vs. worse companies.

These funds are basically invested in everything, which means that if it goes down, the chances that you, an amateur investor, could have picked stocks that didn't also go down is very unlikely. Year over year growth of the total market usually averages out to about 10% which outpaces inflation (~2%). John C Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, believed that the best thing you can do with your money is to put all of it in a low cost full market index fund and not touch it until you're ready to spend it.

The downside to a total market index fund is that you'll never get outrageous gains from it. If you had invested all your money in Tesla five years ago, you'd be way better off than if you had invested in VOO. However, for every Tesla there are a hundred Blockbusters.

2021-04-12 13:24:23,stocks,"
I have seen a lot of positive talk on Reddit about Walmart: $WMT, and was wondering why their German world-wide wholesale retailer Metro AG: $MTTWF (or B4B in Germany) isn‚Äôt being mentioned anywhere.

$MTTWF operates across 22 countries, it was spun-off from $MTTRY a few years ago and the stock has been falling ever since. It‚Äôs been trading side-ways lately so I‚Äôve done some comparison and it looks like both $WMT is financially doing 20x better than $MTTWF (possibly due to business model diversity and dominating the US market). However, the market cap of $WMT is almost 100x that of $MTTWF

Assuming $WMT is trading at fair value today, doesn‚Äôt this entail that $MTTWF is massively undervalued (20% - 30% of fair value)?

I started trading right after March 2020‚Äôs dip, so I‚Äôm interested in hearing opinions from more experienced traders

Disclosure: I own 572 shares as of today, and got some spare cash incase of a dip"
2021-04-12 13:48:04,stocks,"I don‚Äôt know much about the company but here‚Äôs what I would do
Compare EPS and EPS growth rate between the two and ask if the competition is fiercer for German than in USA

Points to consider: 
euro/usd exposure 
savings rate in USA compared to Europe
fiscal stimulus in USA compared to Europe 
As all things, if you are asking these qns, most people are too."

Metro has steady earning, and they‚Äôre expanding.. they need a few more branches to really turn in a profit, but they claim the outlook is good

Walmart had a big jump in earnings after 2019 (~50%)
I believe each is dominating their market in their respective country.. however the US forms a bigger market share than Germany, but there are many more countries dominated by the two giants.. even France‚Äôs Carrefour doesn‚Äôt stand a chance in the competition"

You won‚Äôt achieve this by putting some stupid hat on your head or some dumb glasses, true augmented reality will be done by installing a chip in your brain, it‚Äôll feel like when you‚Äôll be on hard drugs, the closest company that does anything significant regarding this is neuralink by Elon musk, if Elon musk achieves this it‚Äôll be the next amazon, cause there‚Äôs so many aspects you can tap into with this kind of tech, not only gaming and movies, but also in medical sector."
2021-04-12 12:23:01,stocks,"Only downside with that is neuralink is a privately owned company funded primarily by elon musk himself and I don't believe there is a way to invest in it. At least with Space-X which is private you can still ""invest"" in it in several Fidelity funds. If anything Microsoft will probably be the winner as it just received that 20 odd billion dollar contract with the government, and we all know the military gets the cool toys before they let us get them. So they've already got the gaming platform set up, they're going to design augmented reality headsets for the military and it'll get implemented into the Xbox system."
2021-04-12 13:13:50,stocks,"Yes, Microsoft might become a powerhouse, especially since they‚Äôve got into the crypto and btc, it shows they‚Äôre innovative, as for the neuralink, I feel like Elon will wait until the company is profitable, then he‚Äôll take it public"
2021-04-12 13:35:16,stocks,I think by the time its public it'll have too many eyes on it. My biggest hope is TSLA just absolutely tanking shortly before he takes neuralink public so everyone will be afraid to invest in another project of his. Or some funding situation going on like Space-X where Fidelity comes in and buys several billion dollars of the company while its still privately owned and you can own a piece through one of their funds.

NUAN is up significantly today but still trading below the buyout price of $56; it's at about $53.25 at time of this post. Wouldn't it make sense to still buy NUAN shares now given those shares have to be bought by Microsoft at the higher buyout price?

2021-04-12 10:11:41,stocks,"What you described is called risk arbitrage, the deal may or may not close , you may have anti trust issues and if it takes 2 years to close, the return of your 5% is not looking good.  You IRR will depend on when the deal actually closes.  You are right if all your assumptions come to fruition"
2021-04-12 11:17:34,stocks,"There is a risk that the deal doesn‚Äôt go through. 

As a recent example in the Canadian market:

AC (Air Canada) had an agreement to buy Air Tranzat (TRZ) in early (pre-pandemic) 2020 announced in 2019 sometime. Then covid hit, and the purchase was delayed for several reasons (anti-competitive and pandemic). In mid/late 2020 the deal was then changed to a lower $/share, AC did reassure the deal was still on as long as the European Commission approves the deal. Fast forward a few days ago, the Commission did not approve the deal so the acquisition was called off. Prices somewhat tanked, but has been falling since covid. This might also be because TRZ did say that if the merger did not happen, the company might not survive. Overall the price of TRZ went from $17/share at its peak to now $4/share. 

TLDR; 
The news of an acquisition can be good, but if the deal does not go through, the prices will fall back to its prior state so there will be some risk. 

I think you can say that the difference between the price of today and the price of the deal is the margin at which people are willing to take on the risk of the deal going through."
2021-04-12 10:55:45,stocks,"If the deal falls through, you can bet the price won't be at these levels. This is called merger arbitrage, and there are hedge funds whose strategy is to buy such companies after a merger/acquisition is announced. Although there are still risks that the deal may fall through, they bet that the deal will happen, and they get that spread (offer price minus current price). You will notice that Nuance's share will be much less volatile moving forward; basically it will follow a straight line up as we get closer to the deal date (subject to no hiccups along the way). It's not riskless, but it's a market neutral strategy"

I just checked my email again this morning and it is down to #4, ‚ÄúSELL‚Äù. 

It is interesting that a company that is supposedly vetted goes from Buy to Sell in less than a month. 

I am assuming Zack‚Äôs did their DD just the way we do if not a lot more in depth.

Preferably with a 1 billion or more market cap I've had some nice success lately trading stocks in the $10 or $9 ish range. Part of the reason I that I buy about 1k shares, and I can just look for a small 20 cent or 30 cent move, and just get in and out. 

Sure, it's only a 2 or 3 percent deal, nothing spectacular, but sometimes I can get it with surprising consistency. Thing is, I like to learn the rhythm of the particular stock, and allow it to breathe. Thus, I don't necessarily cut losses quickly on it, because I allow it to bounce back and forth a little bit.

This is where the tremendous faith comes in. If it's a company I truly believe in long term, then I'm willing to allow for some more up and down movement in the stock without panicking.

An example I can give is Kopin Corporation. KOPN. I'm not currently in the stock right now, but I have been. I'm a huge believer in AR and VR (Augmented and Virtual Reality). Kopin makes screens and other technologies that are used in these devices."

2021-04-12 12:16:19,stocks,"This comment will be wildly unpopular but based off statistics the most likely outcome for ARKK is: 


1 year: Negative or flat 


2 years: Minimal growth 


3-5 years: Fails to index funds  


6+ years: Fails to beat index funds 


Typically after huge run ups like Cathie had, people pile money into the manager‚Äôs fund. Investing small amounts of money is easy, continuing to keep high returns with lots of money is even harder. We see how the assets under management skyrocketed and is now falling, which isn‚Äôt a good sign. Then if you go further and take a look at her holdings, I think a good chunk of her main ones already have 5 years of rapid growth priced in. You‚Äôd need Tesla/Square/Roku to announce some massive unexpected growth to see any upward movement in its value.  


I think where I disagree with Cathie at is, rather than selling these positions when they‚Äôre overvalued. She keeps buying at the stoopidly inflated price levels."

Which ETF is it? The tech or innovation ones?

I ament sure of all of the ETFs but I hold a lot of Cathie stocks like i said earlier. 

What you need to remember is the stocks she likes need a couple of things to boom. Interest rates low are key for tech/innovation. (Bond market nearly hitting a new yearly high every week)

Uhm. What world are you living in bro? 


ARKK from October 31st, 2014 until January 3rd, 2020 was up 145.98%. 


ARKK from January 8th, 2015 until January 3rd, 2020 was up 166.22%. 


I don‚Äôt know where the hell you pulled this ‚Äú300% growth in 5 years before 2020.‚Äù from. 


Did ARKK beat the market before 2020. Yes. However she was doing that with less than 2 Billion AUM. Have you looked at ARKK‚Äôs AUM chart? It wasn‚Äôt until June 2018 when ARKK had over 1 billion AUM. At the start of 2020 she had less than 2.5 AUM. Today ARKK has 24.2 Billion AUM. In one year AUM went up by a factor of 12, actually it was really less than a year. 


This story has happened time and time again. They go big, the money pours in, they flounder, money goes away. Managers have a much easier time handling small amounts of money and that‚Äôs a fact. There‚Äôs no evidence to suggest Cathie can manage 12x the money and achieve good returns."

I‚Äôm somewhat new to trading, and honestly, the entire ordeal has taught me a ton about the market, so no matter what, this has been a positive experience for me.  I understand the basics of shorting (borrow them, sell high, wait, buy low, give back) but I‚Äôm by no means any good at this stuff beyond using TD for trading a few shares here and there. 

The one question I can‚Äôt seem to get a straight answer to is this: In any situation, but particularly GME, why do the borrowers (such as Citadel or Melvin or whatever) HAVE to give back the borrowed shares that they shorted? I understand there is interest to be paid if they‚Äôre not given back on time, but in terms of buying them back at whatever price the apes set, why can‚Äôt they just go bankrupt? Wouldn‚Äôt it be cheaper to go belly-up, re-organize using the shit-ton of money the no doubt have hiding in different places and just kind of start over? Obviously it‚Äôs not ideal, and they‚Äôd rather just hold out in hopes that GME holders sell low and whatnot. 

It‚Äôs been made out to kind of be the 3rd certainty in life; death, taxes, and giving back shorted shares. I‚Äôm just curious as to why?

2021-04-12 00:00:00,stocks,"Is it possible to offset short-term gains into long-term gains by reinvesting in a different stock for a full year? Note: I currently do not pay taxes as I just finished my diploma in UG.

I have been investing in stocks this year and came to a question:

Would it be possible to close my current position in a stock and then reinvest them somewhere less volatile (like Vanguard ETFs) for a year?

Would it be a legal way to report the gains as long-term capital gains if I were to cash out and transfer some of the profits to my bank account afterward?"
2021-04-12 09:13:33,stocks,As soon as you close any position (long or short) you realize a gain or loss that is taxed regardless of you reinvesting after.  If your income is low enough (I believe under 40k/year) you don‚Äôt have to pay any capitol gains taxes
2021-04-12 09:14:16,stocks,The gains occur as soon as you sell the stock.  It doesn't matter what you do with the money.  Even if you reinvest it in something else you will still own the gains on the first sell.

However, being currently unemployed and have been unemployed in the past, if the short term gain was to be more than 40k, I would be paying the respective amount in that bracket? Or do i just get a freebie for being unemployed (Currently am thinking that there are no freebies in life though)?"

2021-04-12 11:22:57,stocks,What's the catalyst?  I just started hearing about this one today
2021-04-12 12:07:21,stocks,FDA approval of new drug at 430pm expected. They already have approval for 6 other drugs. JP Morgan and Black Rock have huge positions in it. Bought 800 more when it dipped at open.
2021-04-12 00:00:00,stocks,"Portfolio size relative to net worth Hi all,

I recently increased the size of my portfolio to around 20% of my net worth (no house or car, so just portfolio + bank account), and that made me wonder what the average portfolio size of redditors here is.

Is 20% a lot? Or am I still on the conservative side of things?

Obviously, only invest what you can afford to lose! This is just pure curiosity.

&#x200B;

Edit: This has been eye-opening! Thank you all for your feedback and input!"
2021-04-12 06:35:13,stocks,I keep a small amount in cash and 95% in stocks.
2021-04-12 06:47:06,stocks,"If you don‚Äôt have a house or a car, I think 20% is a very small amount. Unless you need the cash to buy a house, a car or as emergency savings, being 80% in cash seems far to conservative. At least as far as conventional investment advice goes.

I‚Äôm probably around 20-25% in the market. Most of my net worth is in my house (probably 65-70% or so), some in my car, some in art and expensive furniture, and a little bit. Maybe 5%, is in cash."
2021-04-12 06:43:54,stocks,"It's hard to say without knowing a roundabout net worth number, but 20% to me is EXTREMELY conservative. If that included your house and a few other things, maybe not. I'm almost fully invested in the market short of my 6 month emergency fund"
2021-04-12 06:59:08,stocks,"Portfolio to net worth seems like a not useful metric.

The reason is that net worth is grown in different stages.

The first thing someone building net worth should do is have a tiny emergency fund in a savings account.   Like $500.  At this stage all you're going to have is the emergency fund, so your portfoliio ratio is zero.

The next stage is to retire any debt.   Still zero on the portfolio. Net worth going up.

Then you might start getting a 401k match at a work.   Since you have only $500 in savings your ratio might end up being very high at this point since it won't take very long to exceed $500.

The next stage is often to build a 3-6 month emergency fund.    Your ratio will likely go down in this stage as this should be in a high yield savings account so you won't be adding to your portfolio. 

Then one might start contributing more to your 401k and roth or traditional ira.  This will result in your ratio going up. 

If you start saving for a house,  your ratio will go down. 

And on and on."
2021-04-12 07:35:27,stocks,"Literally keep $2000 in my savings, and checking stays between $1000-2000 at all times and then all of the rest gets invested (currently like $14,000 invested). Gonna be a bitch tho now that I need to buy a new car and maybe sell positions so I have sufficient cash."
2021-04-12 07:08:15,stocks,"You have 80% in cash???

Are you 85? Otherwise you're basically burning money."
2021-04-12 06:45:59,stocks,"I'm currently about 50/50 (bit more in the market), but I'm also young(ish) and looking to scale that up the market % as I go on.

I started my savings by setting aside 6 months generous living expenses as a rainy day fund which I keep accessible in a savings account and have been funnelling the rest into the market.

I generally invest in funds though so they're a bit less volatile."
2021-04-12 07:37:41,stocks,Hmmm...90% of my networth and that includes a house
2021-04-12 07:41:24,stocks,"Is you are afraid of volatility put something in ""risk-free"" assets like bonds but don't let it sit around doing nothing if you not planning to buy a house in the near future üòÖ"
2021-04-12 08:10:30,stocks,Pay check to pay check and the rest on stocks (USA/aus markets).
2021-04-12 08:14:00,stocks,"It depends how old you are. I am assuming you are young, since you have said that you don't own a car or a house. So therefore 20 % is too less. It should at least be around 80 % to be conservative. If there is any correction you could just add more stocks."
2021-04-12 08:48:00,stocks,"50 cash, 20 safe funds, 15 medium risk, 15 high risk."
2021-04-12 08:48:26,stocks,90% of my NW is in equities. No house
2021-04-12 08:53:03,stocks,"If you aren't planning to buy a house soon, having 80% of your worth in cash in a savings account seems like a lot, unless that 80% is your emergency fund."
2021-04-12 08:59:54,stocks,"i've read somewhere that you can use a general rule of thumb which is 100 - your age = percentage of your portfolio which should be invested out instead of holding cash

of course it differs from individual to individual depending on what stage of life you're at, e.g. if you're young and still live with your parents with little expenses, i'd save 6 months worth of emergency funds and invest the rest regardless of the % above"
2021-04-12 09:09:59,stocks,"80% cash is a shit ton. Most people who are holding that much cash are trying to buy a house/car or are very bearish on current market conditions and trying to buy the dip.

Remember cash is a depreciating asset.. you'll find most people holding maybe 5-20% cash (not including emergency fund)

I'd recommend investing a lot more rather than holding this much cash (doesn't have to be risky investments, just look at safe long term indexes like s and p 500 or something, better returns than cash at least)

I have no house/car with 83% of networth in various stocks/indexes"
2021-04-12 09:46:31,stocks,70% here despite having two houses
2021-04-12 12:28:24,stocks,"Honestly I never even thought about it until now. 


I‚Äôm 95.7% in stocks. However I don‚Äôt own a home either. I have more than normal in cash because I‚Äôm also a student so I don‚Äôt want to risk the cash I use to pay off my tuition or else I‚Äôd be 97% in stocks. 



Honestly I think it‚Äôs a useless metric though. It‚Äôs something fun to know but rather useless."
2021-04-12 12:30:47,stocks,About 10% but only cuz mine is play money
2021-04-12 12:32:05,stocks,"I‚Äôm about 95% in equities. I use my credit card to buy groceries and whatever else I need, and just pay it off bi-weekly. Only now starting to set aside some cash."
2021-04-12 12:44:57,stocks,"The vast majority of my net worth is in relatively safe index funds. That's going to be my retirement money someday.

I only use about 2% of my net worth to play around with trading stocks for short term gains.

Edit: I also have an emergency fund of 6 months expenses in cash. It doesn't really make sense to hold more than that in cash unless you are VERY pessimistic about the stock market's long term future."
2021-04-12 12:51:38,stocks,"40% equities (ETF‚Äôs/Mutual Funds/Stocks), 35% Real estate, 5% Cars, 15-20% cash"
2021-04-12 06:56:38,stocks,Check a ‚Äúhouse‚Äù off your list before you go deeper into market.  We are at all-time highs.  Securing equity in housing that will likely never lose value is the play
2021-04-12 07:28:43,stocks,"30% - 401k / 403b
20% - Taxable investments
20% - Cash
20% - Net Real Estate

I need to work on the 20% cash. I grew up poor so I‚Äôve always had an excessive emergency fund."
2021-04-12 07:28:52,stocks,I‚Äôm 50/50 5k cash : 5k Roth/ long term. Just starting out hope for more in the long term
2021-04-12 15:53:32,stocks,"It sort of depends on your time horizon.  Some equities are more liquid than others. I have a chunk of savings I won‚Äôt need for a couple of years in the market. Most is in savings, because I‚Äôll need it sooner, don‚Äôt want it as exposed to market risk, and don‚Äôt wanna pay income taxes on the gains on top of the money itself for which I‚Äôve already paid income taxes.  This is not including retirement savings. The chunk of money is to work on my house, and the goal is to have beaten inflation with that chunk of money in a few years when I want to use it.

Net worth isn‚Äôt a great figure here, and I‚Äôd talk more about where your more liquid assets are. That is, cash, equities, and funds. If you regularly buy and sell properties and vehicles, you could possibly ignore what I‚Äôm saying here and count it all."
2021-04-12 18:43:03,stocks,"Cash should be very little compared to your net worth. Enough for 6mo emergency fund, plus any forseeable short term expenses. Everything else should be in appreaciative assets/investments (house, real estate, IRA, 401K, brokerage account, etc)"
2021-04-12 19:21:49,stocks,"Everything in real estate and stocks, small amount of cash for emergency fund"
2021-04-12 06:41:25,stocks,"70 here

Depends on your need for cash in the future and your age"
2021-04-12 07:26:19,stocks,"Same. Altho I don't have much, i only keep cash to buy food."
2021-04-12 08:50:35,stocks,"I agree with this. When I bought my first house, despite investing for about 8 years at that point, most of my net worth was in my home. But as time has gone on, my percentage of net worth has grown substantially from stocks and retirement. It‚Äôs about 50/50 now.

Most retirees probably have most of their net worth tied up in investments, at least if they were diligent savers throughout their lifetime.

To each his own, though. I‚Äôm about 50/50 in retirement and my home. My cash reserves is a low single digits percentage of my overall net worth. Just enough to get me through 4-6 months if I lost my job."
2021-04-12 07:17:22,stocks,Thanks for the input! The responses so far have been eye-opening :)
2021-04-12 09:14:22,stocks,is that you Mr. Ramsey?
2021-04-12 08:51:23,stocks,"Exactly this. We're all at different stages on this chart, but its real. You can add kid college funds in there somewhere as well."
2021-04-12 09:54:30,stocks,Do you have a few examples of a decent high yield savings provider? I could use the bank I already use but they are .1 or something. I guess the main benefit isn‚Äôt so much the interest but just the fact that I will stop touching it for frivolous items.
2021-04-12 08:20:04,stocks,Don‚Äôt forget about taxes on gains if you cash out some stock
2021-04-12 08:22:13,stocks,This is the exact reason I treat my investments as a second savings account. I will never exceed a 50/50 ratio between the two. Sure I'm limiting my potential growth but I can navigate life very swiftly. I never ever have to worry about any expenses.
2021-04-12 08:39:39,stocks,"Same, ~$2000 in cash for emergencies and the rest invested. I limit my high risk investments to ensure I have liquidity if something happens."
2021-04-12 07:15:16,stocks,"Pretty new to investing, so still being a little bit cautious :)

Thanks for the feedback, I really appreciate it. Will be scaling it up gradually, probably just DCA'ing into the S&P 500 over the next few months.

2021-04-12 07:16:55,stocks,"Yep that's the plan!

2021-04-12 11:21:34,stocks,"Ally's Saving Account is free and has 0.5% APY. Anything above 0.5/0.65% is difficult to find nowadays.

Check around for deals offered by any local banks or credit unions. For example, I have a local bank account that offers 1.5% APY (with stipulations about how to achieve that 1.5%). The 1.5% accounts that I have seen are High Interest Checking Accts that require 12 debit purchases/month to qualify - I have 12 $0.50 Amazon Gift card auto-reloads a month to achieve that. That ""cost"" is offset after about $7000 in savings, and I don't have to spend that Amazon money immediately."
2021-04-12 15:48:44,stocks,"You have to shop around. Check out some credit unions. Most seem to have something like a few thousand dollar cap for high yield saving. One credit union where I had an account had 4% return on checking accounts with the requirement that you make so many debit card transactions per month.  

I‚Äôm a real advocate of credit unions though. Mine holds my savings, checking, and mortgage. They tend to be a bit more motivated to keep your business than most banks and thus more responsive and flexible."
2021-04-12 08:30:33,stocks,"With only 50% invested, what‚Äôs ur annual profit goal?

Also, about how much do u have in each atm? Just curious, bc net worth obviously changes capital allocation and I don‚Äôt want to follow someone at a different level than me."
2021-04-12 08:41:09,stocks,"Same. I typically won‚Äôt even enter short term trades unless I believe in the long term prospects of the company.

2021-04-12 07:34:12,stocks,"I would say real estate valuations are just as inflated if not more than stock valuations. You are just as likely to see a big decline in the value of a house you buy today as you are if you put the same money into SPY.

I'm just saying, to buy a house right now you have to pay a wild premium because there is a pretty solid imbalance in demand vs supply"
2021-04-12 13:23:23,stocks,"You're welcome! I have heard from friends who do not find the requirements worth it (Specifically the 12 debit purchases). If you pick a cheap gift card refill, set it to charge automatically, and do not use the card for anything else (my card is literally at the bottom of my sock drawer), then you reap the extra 1% at minimal inconvenience to you IMO.

This is only because they are reflecting what's happening in metropolitan areas where houses are selling for over asking on the first day of listing.

It's very troubling to constantly see companies that interest me, but then I look at the balance sheet and there's mountains of long term debt, over and over and over. 

I theorize that the underlying issues to the yield curve inversion are still present, but people are still raving at the JPow low interest rate party. When things ""calm down"" I predict stable but anemic growth overall over the next five-ish years. 

My two cents."

Barring an apocalypse, wont the global stock market, and most individual countries by extension, keep rising as the global population, and population in most countries, continues to rise at the fastest rate in history, which should continue to accelerate? 

I'm not trying to make an argument for a bull market or anything similar. I just see that Earth's population has risen dramatically in the last 200 or so years, and I imagine that will continue for the most part. Just in the last 20 years, Earths population increased from ~6 billion people in 2000 to almost 8 billion today. The global GDP has risen from ~33 trillion in 2000 to  more than 80 trillion today.

2021-04-12 10:02:07,stocks,"Yeah, I didn't start actively watching my accounts until last November. And since then, I've made around 30% gain.

I took most of that equities account and put it into a advisor-managed account with Schwab. I still kept around 20% in my ""personal"" equities account where I can play with stocks here and there, but I moved 80% of my account into wealth management. Because I'll be HONEST. I don't know what I'm doing and I can't read the shift in sectors and rebalancing act that those Schwab algorithms do (I know it's all electronic and the money manager is actually just a guy who passes on info as to what the computer spits out). I pay a management fee of course, but I'm in it for long term growth, so hopefully it is in good hands.

Basically, almost anyone could've made money in the market over the last 4 quarters. But that will obviously give false confidence to those who continue to play in the market. So, I decided to play it safe - let Schwab's algorithm run 80% of my portfolio and I'll keep the other 20% for my own stock choices.

Note: this is purely a wealth accumulation account and not my retirement funds (401k and Roth -which are also managed). But I knew the longer I kept my hands on the wheel, I'd probably miss a shifting of the sands and keep my money in a declining sector. Idk though. The management fee isn't small, but I would probably do more harm than good if I kept 100% control.

Gonna suck when stuff turns bad and there is nothing a money manager can do there. I'll basically be paying Schwab to maintain a red account...which is dumb, but part of the system and how this all works."

2021-04-12 14:40:46,stocks,"> even though the purchasing power of normal US citizens decreases.

This is the grade school understanding of inflation, but that's not how it works in practice. First, the cpi data doesn't support that.  And if you don't like CPI there's plenty of other indexes you can use.    Second, modern history is full of countries with long QE periods with no inflation rise, Japan being an oft cited example.  Inflation only happens if the $$ makes it to everyday people.  This is not the case with this round of QE or other modern ones.  


The unfortunate side effect that people should be complaining about is the widening wealth gap.  On the other hand, a lot of the QE is going to things that benefit society, so it's actually a pretty sensible policy in the grand scheme of things.  That being said, I'm worried about the corners of the internet that go off into weird places on these topics."

2021-04-12 09:12:53,stocks,"GME has been a wild ride, but the pandemic has also been a great opportunity to get into investing, and I truly regret not joining sooner. You only need to go back to March of 2020 to see how investors restructured their portfolios to cash in on the pandemic; most stocks crashed overnight, but many also recovered quite fast, some reaching ATH only months after. A talented investor would be able to predict how long the pandemic would last and which markets would benefit the most from it, for example home entertainment, computer hardware and general e-commerce, though most of these ""only"" doubled or tripled throughout the year, and I fail to think of any stocks and markets that saw a 10x increase in value, except GME of course."

But as the market still volatile, I aim to buy short term and sell if I see 20%.

In fairness, with bond yields being so low, even they a risky purchase now."
2021-04-12 08:50:18,stocks,"Crashes happen, can't avoid them. Best to sell some and keep the remaining. I sell 30% when stock hits 300% (sad thing is the last year getting 300%return quickly was very easy)"

2021-04-12 11:51:54,stocks,"No clue honestly, I thought a small correction was due before corona struck, yet that didn't happen.

Best a person starts investing as soon as they can in my opinion, and only invest with money you won't need within the next couple of years. Even if market crashes, their will be excellent opportunities to buy, and if you purchase a good company stock, it will just be a hicup on its way up.

Key is don't borrow money to invest.

If you can't handle losses, then avoid the market. As fear selling can be dangerous to performance long term."

Kidding aside, hindsight is always perfect. I don‚Äôt disagree that some events were kinda predictable, but got to remember it‚Äôs much easier to read the signs after the facts, than to separate the signal from the noise before them.

Lots did. Some I followed: NIO, Fuelcell, Hertz (after bankruptcy, LOL), Quantumscape, Workhorse, Plug power.
Many more were penny stocks that went viral, like Blink charging (which gained something like 35x), Zomedica and Cassava.
Lots more went close to 10x, like the weed stocks.

All of those I mentioned ultimately crashed, predictably. So much for easy money.

For someone who entered the market last April was stupid easy to make money. Almost everything rocketed, and the crappiest stocks did the most.
March gave the first of many lessons, that it‚Äôs not going to be always this easy.

Slightly higher taxes to pay for it would discourage people from dumping so much of their salary into stocks or property as their only way to save money, and we wouldn't be at a point where the stock market is too big to fail and the currently-on-fire housing market is creating a generation of renters who can't afford to store their wealth into a house."

I'm just saying, if you want to point to inflation in the general economy, picking the sectors most impacted by covid-related disruption and covid-related behavior change (more WFH = more chip demand way too fast for fabs to respond, regardless of the Fed or any investor) don't make the best case.

2021-04-12 10:25:50,stocks,"Those increases aren't from inflation though. They are from supply / demand that was directly caused by the pandemic.

The question is, will the return to work create enough of a demand bubble to replace the supply constraint with a demand stress so producers can pass the inflation on to the consumer? Almost certainly.

Importing is going to be running at max capacity for a while. Domestic assembly and distribution too.

The question isn't whether inflation will move through the system, just how much. And as it moves, will it cause overinvestment or a gold-rush mentality among those who create or carry in the middle? That could lead to a deflationary backlash after the bulge subsides.

So watch for the Fed to first add liquidity (already happening) to help build the supply chains up and get people employed, then sap it to moderate the inflation as it spreads, and then add again to prevent a steep contraction."

Albeit, the pricing on a lot of those opportunities is detached from their true value. More and more it seems like demand for a lot of easily traded securities values are based more on ‚Äúhype-trains‚Äù than actually understanding what it is the trader or investor is buying. And I don‚Äôt even just mean that because of the hive mind if retail investors from places like WSB. It‚Äôs harder to find solid value investments because the slightest hint of good news shoots the price per share to the moon. And because there are so many people sitting on cash, they see bad news as good news - it‚Äôs at most a week long ‚Äúdip‚Äù before people bid up the price to where it was trading before the bad news.

Like you said, a lot of this is being stimulated by the easy money people have access to because of both fiscal and monetary policy. I think the prudent investor sees the overinflated value and has some amount of exposure to cash. But they should also not completely ignore what‚Äôs going on around them or complain if they sat on the sideline last year expecting a sustained downturn.

Some of the statements put out by the fed this year, in my mind, say that the only major indicator they are using to change their easy money policy is inflation, and even then I expect it to be a slow ease off the gas pedal, not a full on pump the brakes.

2021-04-12 10:25:18,stocks,"That's what everyone thinks. Data shows that Indexes have out performed 97% of fund managers in the past 50 years (The Intelligent Investor + Common Sense Investing). The problem in picking stocks is that it's a gamble. You might be on a winning streak for 5 years, but then you hit a losing streak. An example would be Melvin Capital, these guys have out performed the market for half a decade, hedging and risking so hard they have returned 50% in some years... until they reported a 49% loss last quarter.

FAANG stocks have returned 50% for the past half decade as well, but people did a tech sell off and cycled out because growth stocks kind of hit their cap. It's just basic investing, Will Amazon hit a 6 trillion market cap? What are they going to expand into further that allows for this?

The books basically just list why Indexes win long term:

1.) Capped long term capital gains tax

2.) No need to pay advisors to manage your funds

3.) Risk averse hedge holding the entire market so if one sector goes down, it's not going to kill you.

4.) Saving on transaction fees

5.) Less sleepless nights / stress. 

There's more but these stuck with me. Even the pros get it wrong, that's why the market crashed in 2008."

People are going to blame banks, but really it's investor greed and first-time-buyer fomo as buyers jump in blindly, either to sell high later or to avoid having to spend another year building a down payment.

The thing that the banks should be faulted for is not adjusting rates to match the demand. They are leaving money on the table and letting the market cook itself off.

The Fed can't do it. They can change the rates they lend at to banks, but they can't target that to mortgages."

Even now, if you look at Amazon its returns these past year have been significantly lower than let's say 4 years ago etc. It's just how it works, the larger you get by saturating the market means you hit a ceiling eventually because you already saturated the market. Amazon is currently worth 3 trillion with AWS being 1.5 of that almost, I think AWS has matured at this point as already half the of the US companies are on it almost. Azure just won that government contract so we will see how it goes, but I find it hard to believe that AWS will expand another 1.5 trillion. 

You are looking at ATH, but not the overall % gain. That has decreased. Smart money rotated out of tech / growth precisely for that season. That's why you saw such a huge sell off. FAANG isn't a bad buy still, hell it might be eventually even fall under value investing, but no one is expecting another 5 years of 50% returns at this point.

Even the March 2020 crash was peanuts compared the recession of 2008 considering how quickly the markets recovered.

Sure, I knew of the 2008 recession and saw it on the news as it happened, but I didnt have the investment portfolio and economic exposure to truly understand its impact and how I would have reacted to it.

I‚Äôll bet they outperform the index in the next decade

With the fourth industrial revolution upon us, there will always be opportunities for new industries and innovation, you just have to pick companies with good leadership that can capitalize on it.

But lets say you were at retirement age and you couldn‚Äôt deal with drawdown (because you need to withdraw regularly) and still wanted good returns, do you think that the S&P 500 index fund would be good for you? Or would an actively managed fund that doesn‚Äôt beat the market but has consistent returns and small drawdown be better?

I think actively managed funds are here for a reason, and investing isn‚Äôt as simple as beating the market.

Also, the myth that you can‚Äôt beat the market just isn‚Äôt true. Plenty of people do it by investing in literally a few companies. It all depends on your risk tolerance."

I own a few mutual funds that pay from 10% to 1 %yield annually as I like income. Prefer income over growth usually, especially as the dividend isn't taxed were I live, but the last year it been more lucrative to invest in growth stocks.

Would I own the funds if the dividend was taxed? That I am not certain of. May stick to low cost dividend etf's. 

But definitely when hitting retirement, would look more for stable bond funds than equity. God knows how volatile and different market will be in 20 something years. Maybe AI stock pickers would just take over."

2021-04-12 08:57:46,stocks,"**Daily Stock Market Forecast**

What's moving the market today? Honestly, not much -- which is kind of refreshing.

* Powell was on [60 Minutes](https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/11/economy/jerome-powell-federal-reserve-60-minutes/index.html) on Saturday, but the press about it seems fairly optimistic and the market hasn't freaked out.
* The White House is meeting with companies about the [semiconductor chip shortage](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-semiconductors-white-house-idUSKBN2BW2AY)
* Consumer inflation data comes out tomorrow morning. Producer inflation data, which came out on Friday, was twice as high as expected, so this is a bear case.
* In technical analysis, every momentum indicator suggests that we should see the bull market slow a little this week

I've never seen MACD, RSI, and Stochastics all max out and the market not at least go flat for a couple of days, so I am going to call for a relatively flat, slightly red day today.

However, I'd like to be explicit about one thing.

On Friday, I wrote: ""buy puts"", not considering that anybody might actually take my advice. At least one person apparently did and got upset when I was wrong.

I would like to clarify that ""buy puts"" was just me being dramatic. I wasn't actually confident enough in Friday's prediction to buy puts myself, and I'm not confident enough about what's going to happen today to trade off today's prediction, either.

I make these predictions largely just to force myself to do research and write out my thought processes before I make any investments myself. I wouldn't recommend anyone gamble on my predictions without likewise doing their own research and reflecting on their own thought processes.

Anyway -- today is going to be a **red day** with a NASDAQ **high of 13,900** and a **low of 13,824.**

Is this priced in for NVDA? 

I don't think there's enough to say with confidence that it's the case, but if I'm taking my cynicism of the Chinese government to the extreme: this Chinese sales office has access to the full intellectual property rights of ARM and are resistant to the changes that the British hq are trying to impose. So what's stopping the PRC from using the individuals in this office to disclose all types of intellectual property to the chinese government and have it repurposed for the new companies that the Chinese government is trying to foster? The government is clearly worried about ARM being owned by a US company (the Nvidia sale), and the designs can be accessed by this rogue sales office.

I'm less than $5k in the red but I know I can only declare $3k loss per tax year. 

When declaring the loss do I get a ""refund"" back for what I lost or does it just offset any tax liabilities up to the amount I owe.  If the latter,  can I start declaring the max deductions on my paycheck in a way to minimize the taxes I pay and have it offset with what I lost? Like say I typically pay $1k in taxes. I may not have to pay that next year and still have $2k in ""credit"". Can I declare max deductions and pay almost no tax until I hit that $2k?"

Really doubt it. The US made it clear they will defend them, i don't think China wants a Proxy war with the US. China currently isn't very popular geopolitically, and the US is repairing their relationships with allies, so most likely if a war happened all Europe and most of the world would side with the US and do economical sanctions on China, would hurt them pretty badly.

Two things you learn when you live in China:

**The Chinese government is heavily involved in deciding which companies succeed and which companies fail.**

Take Baidu, for example. Baidu is just a shitty Google. It's literally a complete, point-for-point carbon copy of Google and every service Google offers, but done worse.

When you go on Chinese internet, you quickly realize that the main reason services like Google and Facebook are blocked in China isn't information censorship -- it's to let Chinese companies thrive. Google is blocked so that Baidu can succeed with a second-rate plagiarism.

The best company doesn't win in China. The government changes the rules to *make sure* that the company they're backing wins.

**The Chinese government can make someone a god one day and make them disappear the next**

The US media didn't react much when Fan Bingbing disappeared, but that *shit was crazy.*

When I lived in China, Fan Bingbing's face was ubiquitous as Mao Zedong's was in the 1960s. It was everywhere you looked. She was like the god of China.

When she pissed off the government, they completely destroyed her. They pulled her out of her house, locked her up, forced her to tell everyone that she loves Big Brother now and then never let her be idolized again.

Fan Bingbing has been released now, but her time as the god of China is over now.

The exact same thing happen to Jack Ma, who has been China's other god throughout the 21st century.

When China hits Alibaba with a monopoly charge, you can't take it on face value. China *deliberately creates these monopolies.* This means that they're still mad at Jack Ma and that his time as god is over.

China isn't the US. Companies don't bounce back when the government's against them. They get replaced by someone more complacent."

Not everything is caused by ""hedgies"".

The best example I can think of is IAG - the company who owns British Airways as well as many other airlines.

Their stock dropped significantly in the first year of the pandemic, but started to increase more when the vaccine rollout was continuing so steadily in the UK. 

It ultimately dropped again once it was announced that people taking non essential international flights may be hit by a ¬£5000 fine until at least June. But this started improving again once it seemed like this was going to be moved forward to possibly May. 

If you dive deep enough, you'll always find a real world reason for what is happening to a stock, good or bad. 

It's not always ""hedgies"".

Take CD Projekt Red - their stock was high until the broken release of Cyberpunk 2077. It was hit further again when news of the hack was broken. And still continues to be somewhat low with all the backlash it is facing."

Generally for me a house and auto loan are the only acceptable debt...

Even if you just plug all your spare income into VTI you are definitely never guaranteed but you have a high chance of returning more than that 3%

So something id do is calculate the averaged rent/ mortgage cost with your current expenses using your current income. If that does not leave you very much spare money at the end of the month you should pay the loan off now while you can. If there is plenty of spare left over id say keep the loan.

However, financial planning is rarely that simple.  Let's say you lose your job.  How much would having to pay off that car loan shorten your emergency savings runway?  You want to have 3-6 months in cash for ALL your expenses, including your loans, since the kind of economic situation in which you would get laid off is almost always the exact worst time to be forced to sell stocks.  The interest rate of your car loan may be low enough that it isn't worth paying it off relative to the average rate of return of the market, but it is considerably higher than your money could be earning in a savings / money market account.  If you don't have emergency savings, you should probably build that up before doing pretty much else with that money, but if you're trying to extend your emergency savings from say 3 months to 6 months, paying off loans to eliminate the monthly payment may make more sense than just dumping more money into a savings account."

>Think about it this way - people don‚Äôt take out 3% loans on their house to invest in the stock market.

People absolutely do get loans for investment, but putting your house up as collatoral for a stock market loan is pretty stupid, most mortgage lenders won't allow it because they don't trust retail investors.  You know what they do allow though?  Investment property loans, if you want to diversify your portfolio into property you get an investment loan.  You want a loan for the stock market - get a margin account.

Pay off high interest debt, anything above 8% should be a priority.  Low interest loans like the 3% mentioned are more flexible, historic returns of 8% would suggest money is better invested  in the market.  However there is a risk there so there is security in paying off debt.  It's not a black and white answer, paying off debt is safer and guaranteed but there is a **reasonable** assumption that investing could yield greater returns in the long run.

2021-04-12 00:00:00,stocks,"Investing in the American stock market as an expat If I am an American citizen living abroad (Japan) but use my American address (as my residence) to create a brokerage account, how does this legally play out with taxes and such?

If I claim large gains from stocks, am I still entitled to them or are does the government take them away?

&#x200B;

edit 1: rephrasing my concern for clarity:

Am I breaking any American tax rules by using my American address as my residence on an American brokerage app so that I can trade stocks in America, even though my true residence is here in Japan? "
2021-04-12 01:19:01,stocks,Can't escape the IRS. Do you have to claim it on your Japanese return too?
2021-04-12 02:29:19,stocks,"Hi. I'm also in Japan.  It's complicated.  

I'm assuming you work for a Japanese company.  

Basically, how long have you been a resident of Japan?  Because a lot depends on that.

Less than 5 years?  -> Income (salary) from your Japanese company would probably already be reported for you to Japan by your company by the Âπ¥Êú´Ë™øÊï¥.  You also are required to report your income to the U.S., but you can take a tax credit or [FEIE](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-earned-income-exclusion) so that you don't get double-taxed on it.  Next, of course, any gains you made in your brokerage account need to be reported to the U.S. as well, and you may need to pay taxes on them to the U.S.

5+ years? -> Then you're required to pay all your taxes to Japan regardless of where they came from.  You'll have to manually report your income using the Á¢∫ÂÆöÁî≥Âëä form, because your company probably doesn't know/care about your income from trading.  You'll have to fill it out and mail it in.  The deadline is like, April 15th, so you better get on that soon!  You also need to report to the U.S. as in the less than 5 years case, but due to tax treaty between the U.S. and Japan, you shouldn't have to pay any tax to the U.S.  Here's some more reading to get you started with the Japan side:
https://www.nta.go.jp/english/index.htm

Finally, in either case, if you have any financial accounts (like your bank account) in Japan, and the value at any point during the year was over $10k USD, then you need to report the [FBAR](https://www.fincen.gov/report-foreign-bank-and-financial-accounts).

Good luck!

I guess I am obligated to mention that I'm not an accountant or anything, and this is not financial advice. Blah blah. Don't come after me if anything I wrote is wrong."
2021-04-12 01:55:37,stocks,Follow nomadcapitalist on YouTube. His book also explains some of this. I believe the fed has a rate for expats depending on the amount of gains.
2021-04-12 04:05:37,stocks,"It‚Äôs not illegal to use your US address but you are very likely violating the terms and policies of the broker. They all require you to identify your tax residency and you would be effectively lying to them. Worst case they can close your account and possibly liquidate your holdings. There are several brokers who allow customers in Japan so why not use them? I‚Äôve head TD, Schwab and interactive brokers. 

It would  be illegal if you do this for the purpose of avoiding taxes on Japan or the us.  However as long as you pay all your tax obligations appropriately you wouldn‚Äôt be violating the law. 

Try to find videos from Thun Financial. They‚Äôve gone over a lot of these legal questions in their seminars. Laws change though so you should always consult a tax attorney before doing something. 

I‚Äôm not a lawyer and this is not legal or financial advice."
2021-04-12 01:07:52,stocks,You're required to pay state and federal taxes on gains.

2021-04-12 02:03:21,stocks,"I‚Äôm not an expert so you should check with an accountant in Japan but if none of that money is made or received in Japan, at least I dont think you‚Äôll have to pay anything to the japanese government"

2021-04-12 10:48:25,stocks,"No.  In my estimation, it doesn't matter where you sit when you trade.  What matters is your status.  You ARE a citizen, you HAVE a US address already, so why shouldn't you take the tax position of such a citizen just because you happen to be sitting in Japan?   Same thing if you have US bank accounts, their annual tax status for you doesn't change just because you are sitting in Japan now, do they?"
2021-04-12 02:39:37,stocks,"I wasn't trying to escape the IRS. In fact, I'm trying to do this straight so I dont accidentally break any rules. 

Its just that starting an account while abroad has been super challenging because I dont know what the rules are. If I use my Japanese address, I cant start an account. But, if i use my American address, I can. however, I'm unsure if this is allowed or not"
2021-04-12 02:48:39,stocks,"lol I love the disclaimer. 

Thank you for that! I have been here for 4 years, so I guess I dont need to worry about the 5 year change quite yet. 

that being said, allow me to rephrase my question because I think my post did a poor job and led people astray  haha 

What I was trying to ask was this.  Am I breaking any American tax rules by listing   my American address as my residence on an American brokerage app so that I can trade stocks in America, even though my true residence is here in Japan?"
2021-04-12 10:51:41,stocks,"Most of this, while true, relates to having to ALSO pay taxes to Japan.  But the fundamental tax position of a US citizen with a US address who opens a financial account in the US is not affected by where they sit or reside.  The only thing that changes for him/her due to being in Japan is what is the additional tax obligations TO JAPAN from doing this.  The tax obligations TO USA don't change no matter where you reside, IMO"
2021-04-12 11:52:24,stocks,"Do you have experience in paying taxes in Japan? 


Do I need to write my day job income in Á¢∫ÂÆöÁî≥Âëä or just stock gains? Do I need to report anything additional when doing Âπ¥Êú´Ë™øÊï¥Ôºü

2021-04-12 02:34:11,stocks,"ah, I'm sorry. I dont think I articulated my concern clearly enough in the title. 

I meant to ask if I was breaking any American government rules by using an American brokerage account that uses my American address as my residence while living abroad. I wasn't concerned about breaking any Japanese rules."

2021-04-12 07:46:46,stocks,"You are good with an APO, DPO, or FPO address.  The brokerages give an exception to government employees (such as military service members or state department foreign service officers) stationed overseas on official  orders."
2021-04-12 05:37:29,stocks,"I am in the same boat living in Europe as an American.

I have an index fund with Fidelity (created before moving about 12 years ago) and recently tried to open a brokerage account to start investing in some stocks.

The issue was with 2-step verification I had to have a US telephone number which I don't. I looked into some ways I could get a US telephone number for the sole reason of this 2-step verification but it just didn't feel right.

Ended up opening an account with Ameritrade with my US address (which I don't see myself going back to for 10+ years).

The problem seems that there are lots of rules for brokerages dealing with ""outside US"" accounts that they don't want to be responsible for and decided it is just not worth it.

Thats not how it, or any vaccine for that matter, works. The mRNA vaccine uses the machinery present in our cells to produce the antigens directly, rather than them being produced in a lab first. These antigens then get detected as foreign by the body, which develops antibodies specific to those antigens, thus allowing it to identify the virus in the future and initiate a faster and more effective immune response."

So the original quote used was ""Daily case and death growth rates **before implementation** of mask mandates were not statistically different from the **reference period.**""  The keys here are ""before implementation [of a mask mandate in this case]"" and ""reference period"".  The reference period is noted here: ""Associations between the policies and COVID-19 outcomes were measured using a reference period (1‚Äì20 days **before implementation**)"".  This means that the reference period was 1-20 days before the mask mandates.

> P<.03... statistically insignificant according to the study.

The study states that ""P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant"" meaning that < .03 is indeed statistically significant according to the study.

Basically the study does show that masks have helped:

* 1-20 days after mask mandate:  
0.7 percentage point reduction daily death **growth rates** p < 0.01

* 21-40 days after mask mandate:  
1.0 percentage point reduction daily death growth rates p < 0.01

* 41-60 days after mask mandate:  
1.4 percentage point reduction daily death growth rates p < 0.01

* 61-80 days after mask mandate:  
1.6 percentage point reduction daily death growth rates p < 0.01

* 81-100 days later:  
**1.9 percentage point reduction in daily death growth rate**  p < 0.01.  

That means if, before the mandate total deaths were growing at 3% per day, then after the mandate, they were growing by only 1% per day. (Percentage point change, not percentage change).

Again, the threshold for significance they used was .05. Anything lower is considered significant."

One significant possibility is that the stock becomes more attractive to a wider range of buyers. Especially for a stock like Amazon, which has a high level of brand recognition, and a high price which is likely a major deterrent for retail investors. A stock split would then make the price go up, because the stock is in higher demand. That adds plenty of value for shareholders, no?"

2021-04-12 00:00:00,stocks,"Resubmitting my NEE DD with hopefully better formatting  Before continuing I feel like I should make clear that I am not a financial expert nor am I an expert on the stock market in general, I am just an average investor who likes to listen to Earnings Reports and stock reviews on his hour long commute to work each day M-F. I don‚Äôt have any special insider info, just what I can Google and I do not currently hold any positions of NEE but plan to buy a decent amount of shares proportionally to the rest of my portfolio after the purchase of a new car that I am saving for.  Ideally I‚Äôll be buying and adding to my initial investment within 2 months as I‚Äôm expecting to only have to save up for another month and a half until I can buy the new car I am looking at. I‚Äôm also planning to add $100 every paycheck to my Roth during this period of saving for my car so that could also turn into a few shares of NEE before my planned larger initial buy. 

NextEra Energy Inc (ticker symbol NYSE: NEE) is the world largest utility company and is composed of three subsidies, Florida Power and Light (FPL), Gulf Energies, and NextEra Energy Resources LLC, which, combined with its affiliated entities, is the worlds largest green energy supplier/generator or solar and wind energy, well earning it the title of Supermajor. Traditionally the title of Supermajor is reserved for the largest players in the oil and gas industries since those companies control the energy that powers modern civilization, oil. However due the recent drop in cost to build and maintain renewable energy generation along with a larger than anticipated federal backing, renewables have lead to a new wave of energy Supermajors rolling in, and NextEra is leading the charge. Not just in the US, but globally as well. In this DD I am going to attempt to go over some basic financial information as well as some upcoming and past events that I see as growth opportunities and how those all pertain to NEE‚Äôs potential to be a long term dividend growth company that I feel deserves a spot in any investors portfolio if their time horizon is 30 years plus like mine is with my Roth IRA. (I am currently 23, so I can‚Äôt touch my tax free earnings for another 36 years, but that‚Äôs okay because I‚Äôm that time I‚Äôm expecting an avalanche of snowballs to occur if I‚Äôm successful in picking my portfolio.)

NEE pays a dividend traditionally in the months of March, June, September, and December. NEE stock is operating with a current share price of $77.94 and a current dividend FY 2021 dividend payment of $1.55 with a yield of 1.98%, down from their 4 year average of 2.78% which is itself down from the Utility Sector average of 3.24% suggesting it still has room to grow its dividend as NEE continues to lead the world in green energy generation. This current yield represents an \~10.71% increase from last fiscal years dividend of $1.40. Looking into FY2022 it is expected that the payout will again increase, this time to $1.71 representing another \~10.71% increase YoY.  And while NEE themselves have only offered guidance through 2022, Morningstar Analysts have gone a bit further, and predict NEE to raise its dividend by >10% each year through 2024. While this may seem like a bullish prediction it is important to know that NEE has been increasing its dividend for the last 27 years and has raised its dividend an average of 9.6% each year since 2005 and in the last 5 years alone, it has grown its dividend by over 12.5%. Finally, NEE only has a dividend payout ratio of 61.31%, which explains its dividend safety score of 99 and why analysis expect this dividend to continue to grow. Thanks in part to its share price appreciation but mostly it‚Äôs growing dividend, NEE has been able to provide a total return to shareholders of 700% over the last 10 years while the S&P 500 only returned 267% or less than half that of NEE.

Moving away from the dividend financials and looking more broadly at the companies overall holdings one ratio that sticks out to me is the Debt/Equity ratio of 1.32 which suggests that they are financing some of their expansion/growth and expenses by taking on debt. While this might seem like a bad thing, companies, especially utility companies focusing on green and renewable energy, are expected to leverage their debt and take on more debt to expand during this early developmental stage for the industry as a whole. Additionally when compared to its US competitors of Duke Energy ($DUK) and Southern Company ($SO), then NEE actually has a lower D/E ratio since both of them have a ratio of 1.34 and 1.84 respectively. The next question that might naturally come to mind then is ‚ÄúWell if they have a lower D/E ratio does that mean they are growing slower than the other two companies mentioned?‚Äù While that is a great concern to have but one that is ultimately not needed. The reason for this is because NextEra has been investing into green and renewable energy for so long and so aggressively that its is now able to funnel some of the profits it is starting to see from those initial investments into growing itself and expanding, thus reducing its need to grab more debt. 

A perfect example of this occurred in 2018 when NextEra Energy Resources finalized a massive deal that saw them acquire 11 new and under construction solar and wind farms that are now starting to become profitable as they were essentially being used to pay for them selves during the first three years NEE owned them per the terms of the contract (it was a 3 year payment period). Luckily time tends to move forward rather predictably and now, 3 years later in 2021 NEE is able to start using the profits from the approximately 1,388 MW (1MW is enough to power 400-900 average American homes for a year) generated from those facilities to finance itself rather than pay for the purchase of those facilities. One such project they are financing is their ‚Äò30-by-30‚Äô plan, where they intend to install at least 30 million active and generating solar panels in Florida alone by 2030. This is an ambitious goal that they believe they can accomplish and when you realize that there are only just over 2 millions solar panels actively in use across all of America, anyone can see the potential upside that being the one to supply all those panels and the energy they generate might bring.  This is an approximate 15X the current number of solar panels in the country, only they expect them to be all in a single state. It‚Äôs worth noting that this isn‚Äôt even NEE‚Äôs only future oriented project, but rather just one that highlights the growth potential NEE has in the long run.  

Another important metric to consider when looking at a company from a dividend growth perspective, is its cash flow. As one might expect from a dividend aristocrat, NEE is cash flow positive and has been increasing its cash flow YoY consistently (while paying down large amounts of debt left and right such as in 2020 when they paid off all their short term debt for that year as well as an additional $5 billion in long term debt) with the exception of 2018 which as previously discussed was a year of large growth and spending, and 2020 which was a global pandemic and even then, NEE was more even with 2019‚Äôs cash flow and didn‚Äôt really lose any; NEE was cash flow positive for both 2020 and 2018 despite the increased spending or macroeconomic hardships and raised its dividend during each as well. Another thing to note is that it has relatively maintained its operating income proportionally over the years ($4-$5 billion/year) even as its new projects come online and are intergraded into its network. This shows it‚Äôs still growing and maintaining it‚Äôs expected level of operations at its older sites. 

Another import financial element involved in long term dividend growth investing is a companies Price/Book ratio value. In this case NEE has a P/B ratio of 4.18, significantly higher than the Utility Sectors average of 2.66 currently. I believe there is an explanation for this however, and it has to do with NEE‚Äôs heavy investments (spending a lot of money years ago before it was even close to profitable) into renewables and green energy over the years that has caused this higher number. When you compare NEE to √òrsted ($DNNGY), which has a P/B ratio of 4.56 and has been investing into green and renewable energy almost as aggressively and as long as NEE and you can see how the larger renewable utility sector that is focused on growth is trading at a higher P/B ratio than the rest of the Utility Sector in general. 

The final financial metric I am interested in when looking at a dividend growth stock is its P/E ratio, and this is where NEE‚Äôs main critique comes into play. NEE‚Äôs current P/E ratio is 53, a  bit higher than the industry average of 28 (as of 2019, and 23 as of 2020 when looking at only electric companies) and the average range of 15-25 that its closest US competitors currently occupy. Personally I believe two things can happen because of this higher than average P/E ratio. 

1) Investors eventually believe the stock price is over valued and as a result I believe that the price/share will fall as investors sell off to make a profit before it corrects to a lower P/E. 

\- If this is something you believe would happen but still want to invest for the long term growth than I believe a decent strategy might be to consider dollar cost averaging in until the price starts to trade sideway indicating it‚Äôs more or less bottomed out, and when it reaches that point you can buy a majority of your shares than. 

2) Investors don‚Äôt believe the stock price is overvalued long enough for NEE to increase its earnings, thus lowering the P/E ratio by making more money as more and more projects are completed and acquisitions start to provide income instead of being used to purely pay for themselves. 

\- Now if this happens to be what you believe to be true then I believe the best course of action would be to open a majority of your position in NEE now and then dollar cost average in as time goes on and taking advantage of any single red days or the market as a whole is down. 

Now personally I believe that a combination of both options will occur where the share price will fall \~14.28% from today‚Äôs price to the analysis‚Äô low price target of $66 over the course of a year or so. At the same time however I also expect NEE to increase their earnings by a combination of increasing generation capacity and service area, as well as saving large amounts of money on the costs of harvesting, storing, and transporting solar and wind power which have dropped 70% since 2010 and are continuing to do so. I then expect the price to bounce back if it fell to much, or trade about flat if it corrected just right, around a P/E ratio more in line with its industry, around 15-25. As a result I‚Äôm personally planning to buy shares next time it‚Äôs time to add to my Utilities Sector in my Roth IRA and continue buying more shares as time goes on. 

The next segment of NextEra that I want to dive into are its upcoming projects, and while I‚Äôve eluded to a few previously in this write up such as their ‚Äò30-by-30‚Äô plan, which actually includes another upcoming community solar project within it called SolarTogether that, when completed, will be the worlds largest solar network of its type. NEE also merged two of its main subsidiaries, Florida Power and Light with Gulf Energy at the start of 2021. 

NextEra Energies ‚Äò30-by-30‚Äô plan is a current project and ongoing investment that is already underway which will generate an additional estimated 10,000 MW/year to their network. Furthermore, within the ‚Äò30-by-30‚Äô plan is a project named SolarTogether, which is estimated to generate 15% of the ‚Äò30-by-30‚Äù plans total output or 1,500 MW/year, is a solar community project that, when completed, will be the worlds largest community solar project. SolarTogether will allow customers to offset up to 100% of their electricity use with solar. SolarTogether also allows individuals to sign up to use excess solar energy produced by neighbors when an individual doesn‚Äôt have any solar panels on their roof and doesn‚Äôt want to pay to install them. This offers a cheaper and greener form of energy that would have been either wasted if the battery for that area was full already or just put into that battery for storage, allowing NEE to make more money off of of what is essentially excess power since it‚Äôs only the energy not needed by the original home that collected it. 

The final bit of acquisition/merger news that I feel is pertinent and deserves to be discussed is the merger of NEE‚Äôs subsidiaries FPL and Gulf Energy. Under the now single entity, NEE, will officially begin shifting its entire company to a entirely green energy focus. In 2021 it is closing its final coal powered plant and no longer using any coal generated energy while simultaneously pledging to no longer build any combined cycle gas plants and cancelling any ongoing construction on projects not yet completed. This is to keep in line with their company pledge to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions by 57% by 2029 compared to NEE‚Äôs emissions in 2005. In addition, another aspect of NEE‚Äôs green energy pledge is to use the merged companies to work on and complete a planned 409 MW solar energy battery. When completed, it will be the world largest solar energy battery but it will still only be a part of NEE‚Äôs plan to increase total storage capacity by 1,200 MW by 2029 dramatically increasing their storage capabilities. 

NEE is a utility sector green and renewable energy focused energy provider that currently trades at $77.94, has an analysis target price range of $66 - $101, and an average price target of $87.50. Personally I see NEE‚Äôs share price falling no more than \~15% (hitting the analysis low PT of $66) as it‚Äôs revenue continues to rise resulting in a reduction to its current P/E ratio sometime this year. Once that happens I expect the price to bounce and return to its expected rate of return of close to 8-9% plus its dividend growth rate averaging 9-12% which could carry the stock back to the APT of $87.50 with occasional spikes and run ups close to $100 this year, and finally passing $100 in 2022.  As such I  planning on buying a few shares when I‚Äôm next able to invest and will continue to dollar cost average in regardless of the price as I view this as a truest safe long term 20+ year play that I can sit on and just watch snowball until I‚Äôm ready to retire in like 30 years. 

Once again, I am not a financial expert nor am I an expert on the stock market in general, I am just an average investor who likes to listen to Earnings Reports and stock reviews on his hour long commute to work each day M-F. I don‚Äôt have any special insider info, just what I can Google and I do not currently hold any positions of NEE but plan to buy a decent amount of shares proportionally to the rest of my portfolio after the purchase of a new car that I am saving for.  Ideally I‚Äôll be buying and adding to my initial investment within 2 months as I‚Äôm expecting to only have to save up for another month and a half until I can buy the new car I am looking at. I‚Äôm also planning to add $100 every paycheck to my Roth during this period of saving for my car so that could also turn into a few shares of NEE before my planned larger initial buy but I will definitely be opening a position soon with plans to hold it the next 36 years. 

Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed this DD that I wrote up for my friends and my discord. Please leave any additional info I might have left out as it pertains to NEE or any other stocks that you like and why. Hopefully this attempt doesn't kill everyone's eyes."

In early January, though, I started using Robinhood for more risky trades in hope of a short term gain. Ive had big gains and big losses, but overall, I have a small overall gain. I‚Äôve done a lot of trades, though, with buying and selling stocks + calls and puts. I don‚Äôt keep track of my trades, and I‚Äôm starting to worry about my taxes. Should I be keeping track of them? I‚Äôve just heard that people do, so I‚Äôm a little worried now... also what else in general should I do to make sure I can do my taxes for my trades smoothly?"
2021-04-11 23:31:03,stocks,"Refer to your monthly statements from Robinhood. Add up your total realized gains since January, and that‚Äôs your taxable income. Losses are only deductible up to a certain amount annually and roll over. Short term capital gains are taxed as regular income. 

Google ‚ÄúEffective tax rate calculator‚Äù and it will give you a good idea of what you can expect to pay next year.

Also ditch robinhood and use a real brokerage. Most (I know fidelity does) have much better tools for tax forecasting.

Hope this helps!"

2021-04-11 23:27:14,stocks,"First and most important is the wash sale rule - you can‚Äôt claim any loses, if you purchased the same stock or stock option within 30 days after selling. You need to count sales from all brokerage accounts. If you were making a lot of trades especially in multiple accounts, then you have to involve a professional for your own good. If you are not familiar with the wash sale rule - don‚Äôt even attempt to do this yourself. Not a financial advise. I am not a professional and I may be wrong."
2021-04-11 23:38:49,stocks,"Losses are completely deductible up to $3000 MORE than your gains. So if you gained $100k in a year and lost $100k in the same year, you‚Äôd owe $0 for taxes on those trades. 

But, like you said, if the losses exceed the gains then you can use up to $3k annually to reduce your overall income and roll it over year after year. Using example above if you gained $100k in a year and lost $109k, you get to use $3k each year for 3 years to reduce your taxable income."
2021-04-11 23:32:23,stocks,"Well I haven‚Äôt had more than $2000 in my Robinhood account at any point yet, so I shouldn‚Äôt be worrying about any major taxes, then?"

2021-04-11 23:35:51,stocks,"Only partially true. The loss is just delayed and added to the cost basis of the next shares when you buy within 30 days. You still get to ‚Äúuse‚Äù the loss eventually. 

If he closes out all positions now and doesn‚Äôt rebuy any of that stock in the next 1-2 months, it basically acts as if the wash sale rule doesn‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs only important when buying/selling near end of the calendar year."
2021-04-11 23:34:07,stocks,Just make sure you understand wash sales
2021-04-11 23:46:30,stocks,"Your Robinhood transaction will affect your other accounts. 1099 from Robinhood will not work for you since each transaction affects your other account transactions. At least this is my understanding - not an expert, not an advise."
2021-04-12 08:09:10,stocks,I don't live in the US
2021-04-11 23:40:33,stocks,"Yes, you are correct. I did not want go into details.

2021-04-11 22:40:30,stocks,"Not sure about your question...ADRs have options chains, just look at NIO. Maybe some disallow derivatives?"
2021-04-12 04:46:28,stocks,RYCEY is not listed on the major exchanges (NYSE/NASDAQ) and therefore does not have options.

Let's say the market crashes tomorrow. Am I better off setting a trailing stop loss at say 8% or should I ride the wave all the way down and add shares along the way? 

I should add, I don't have thousands of dollars to YOLO once the market is in free fall. Regardless of what happens tomorrow, I plan to purchase 2-3 shares of VOO or QQQ per month. 

Appreciate the insight."
2021-04-11 22:24:50,stocks,"These are long term holds, long term as in for decades. If either of these stocks drop 8% you don't sell, you see it as a discount and buy more. The whole point of investing in something like voo or qqq is to buy it and ignore it, most of the time. Why? Because most people can't beat the market. By trying to micromanage your portfolio you will ultimately fuck it up more than if you had just left it alone. That being said, if you wanna be cautious, you can always hedge against your shares."
2021-04-11 22:19:38,stocks,"So the position is down 8% and your trailing stop loss goes off, which is a market order, and your broker fills your order near the bid in the spread (due to the priority of a stop loss) and due to market panic/high volume could be a few points LOWER than the bottom (yes it is absolutely *possible*).    

Fuck. Market. Orders.     

Limited orders are flawed too (your limit can be skipped entirely). But at least with a limit you're just left holding the position, whereas a market order can be a worse scenario than even that, you can literally get a price *below* what it traded at ***ever***. With a hold you can wait it out/may lose nothing, with a bad sell you're screwed unrecoverably.   

Market orders + high volatility = suicidal."
2021-04-11 23:19:02,stocks,"Why 8%? Me personally I have the best gains with a 25% trailing stop. If I use a 4% asset allocation  I would only lose 1% of my portfolio with a 25% t.s.

When I used 10% I exited too early to realize the future gains is what I found to be the case."
2021-04-11 22:19:35,stocks,I wouldn‚Äôt try to time the market. Just average cost down. Not financial advice. Also depends on how old you are.

Maybe if you‚Äôre lucky and good you could do a little better than the fund if you just leave it be; but it‚Äôs far more likely you‚Äôll repeatedly shoot yourself in the foot and get frustrated. 

A far better strategy is to just make regular payments into the index funds. The payments made when the market crashes will be worth even more when it recovers. 

Personally, I use index funds and the like as a semi stable backstop for the riskier stuff. But the index funds themselves are very much set and forget kinda things."

What is your approach when you're holding a stock with Solid DD and upcoming catalysts but it breaks your mental stop loss and continues selling off gradually, either because the market in general is selling off or another reason‚Äîbut the company's fundamentals, DD, and catalysts have not changed?


I have a group of small caps stocks that have been doing this, and I'm down about 30% on most of them. I kick myself for not selling them when my stop loss was reached, but I also fear that if I sell I may miss the rally, or I may buy a fake breakout only to see another dip.

How do you approach these situations?"
2021-04-11 22:03:09,stocks,"If I believe in it I hold it and sell calls against it, and if it drops more would consider averaging down some.   There‚Äôs been a big rotation out of small cap and especially small cap biotech, I‚Äôm continuing to hold and sell calls on the run ups.

I'm more talking about more speculative stocks, if there is ever a huge pop and I get lucky or it goes to 100%, I basically just cut my position in half and let the rest ride. In newer companies, it's sometimes really hard to tell where they will ultimately go.

Would it be a good idea to buy a close to the money/itm call on the stock, and essentially hold 100 shares up until a certain date, then roll forward if still bullish, or should I buy shares?

For example, lots of people are bullish on Amazon but the price hasn‚Äôt moved in 9 months. The people who bought LEAPS atm 9 months ago are down like 30-40% but those who bought shares are net 0 still"
2021-04-11 21:46:56,stocks,"You may want to ask this in r/options

It also depends on how much IV is priced in the options as a ATM/ITM would likely be subject to some time decay.

A more conservative approach would be selecting a deeper ITM call, as you'll be subject to less time decay.

If you're very bullish and more on the 'YOLO' side, then an ATM/ slightly OTM call would give you better ROI"
2021-04-11 22:20:35,stocks,"I'll give you a fairly simple answer. How much are you willing to lose?

Calls being higher risk can offer for higher profit and far higher loss. Many factors play in such as the stock, the iv, how far out the calls are ect but you unlike stock where you can hold forever hoping for good things those calls will come to an end."
2021-04-11 21:36:33,stocks,"Dude. I have been pricing similar scenarios. If the calls are offered and you are sure, buy the calls.  If you don‚Äôt know the ‚Äúwhen‚Äù buy the stock."
2021-04-11 23:09:31,stocks,"You need more than 3k to make any safe long term calls on a $300 stock. Ideally you want to sell short term calls against your long term one to keep making profits from the premiums. But that would require a far dated call with at least 0.7 delta. You would need much more than $3000.

If you're absolutely sure of its bull run, then of course buying calls are the way to go. But why not buy near term calls, and avoid the risk of losing all in one shot. Or even better a bull spread, if you have a target price in mind 2 years from now. A naked call 2 years into the future is a pretty risky move."
2021-04-12 04:41:43,stocks,"A 3rd option is to sell a spread + buy a call. This will allow you to control the stock for as long as you want for about a third to half the price.

The drawback with dated calls is that the stock price needs to rise a certain amount before you break even. Ie. You buy at a strike of $100 for $5, you lose if the stock closes at 104.99.

However, if you sell a call at 100, then buy two calls at around 70, then you start profiting much sooner.

Technically, you want to be short one atm call and long two 70 delta calls. This is a synthetic long and typically costs about 1/3 of the stock price when buying a 1 year leap.

And you can actually control you break even as well by playing with the strikes. If you want to spend full price on the share your breakeven can be 20% lower than the current price, for example."
2021-04-11 22:06:58,stocks,"The way I go about it is this. 

1. I have decided I will buy the stock and hold - forever or until there is a clear fundamental change - but generally going to hold for 10+ yrs. so I will buy and hold this at this price regardless. 

2. If I choose a deep itm call instead, can I cover the option if I need to exercise it at any point? If yes then use the option. If not, just buy the stock. 

This way I know I‚Äôm paying a very small premium for a potentially much larger gain. And since I would have bought the stock anyways, well the calls were a better option and not more risky than then the stock itself."
2021-04-11 23:28:08,stocks,"This is exactly what u/deepfuckingvalue had to decide on when opening his GME trade. He ended up buying options, I think mainly because 2 reasons 1)he had very high conviction in the stocks undervaluation understanding their financials and other details that no one paid attention to and 2) he had a thesis that during the 2020 console refresh cycle people would start paying attention to the stock and it‚Äôs undervaluation. So he had a time in mind where he thought there would be a big catalyst. 

You seem to have the conviction. So if I were you, I would ask myself if I think there is a high probability of a substantial positive catalyst occurring during that period holding the option. If there isn‚Äôt any concrete catalyst that comes to mind it‚Äôs probably better off to hold the stock. Either way, good luck!"
2021-04-11 21:55:31,stocks,"It's impossible to know without knowing the IV of the option and how much you think it's going to move.

If you were asking about deep itm calls leaps, I'd say those."
2021-04-11 23:18:31,stocks,"My math equation for solving this question for myself:

x/share price = (x - exercise price)/cost of call

This gives you     x = share price where it would be better to buy calls.

For example, if it costs $300 for a share now, and a LEAP costs $80 to exercise at $300 in 2 years then:        x/300 = (x-300)/80

This solves to   x = $409.09

So if you think the share price will be over $409.09 (given the numbers I used, you will likely have to adjust) at the exercise date, then it is worthwhile to buy the long calls.

Hope this helped :)"

2021-04-12 01:36:54,stocks,"The way is see stocks VS options is that equity feels safer and more tangible, whereas with an option, theta decays the value of your option. But purchasing the option frees up your capital, upping your leverage."

2021-04-12 10:16:08,stocks,"Might want to consider a long-dated call debit spread play as well. Better risk-reward profile in my opinion. In any case, I would recommend taking a portion of that $3K and buying shares and setting up an options position with the remainder. Say, $1K of shares and remaining $2K in long-dated options. Better be really confident about the company's future though."
2021-04-11 23:16:20,stocks,"I don't recommend buying an OTM or ATM call. They will be cheaper but you simulate owning fewer shares. For example if you buy a .5 delta call you're actually simulating owning 50 shares rather than 100.

So I would go deep ITM, high delta, preferably > 0.9. This also lessens the impact of theta decay.

Also look at IV. If IV is high the premium will cost more and will push your break even higher, even if you think the share price is a good entry point.

Finally, make sure the options are liquid. You want a tight bid/ask spread and good amount of volume/open interest if possible. Otherwise you're going to pay more to buy them (closer to the ask) and make less when you sell them (closer to bid).

Long story short, if you are bullish, you want leverage, and IV is low and volume is decent, buy deep ITM calls. Otherwise buy shares.

Note that you won't get dividends from owning calls if the stock has one."
2021-04-11 22:32:03,stocks,"r/options is the place to ask. 

ATM provides 0.5 delta. Meaning that there is 50% leverage. So that can cut both ways.

You can get 10 shares or 100 potential shares?

Remember, with an option you risk losing it all. You could do something like a straddle or any variation to reduce your risk.

2021-04-12 06:18:11,stocks,Easy answer. If you are long-term bullish on a stock buy that stock and hold it. With calls you have to not only be right that it's going up but it has to be going up within your time frame otherwise you end up with nothing in your hands. If you truly love the stock buy it and hold it and don't look back.
2021-04-12 07:02:36,stocks,"If you want leverage and want to protect your capital, you could buy deep itm calls. 

$3000 for $300 shares would be 100 shares.  

Or you could spend $3000 for $150 LEAP calls. That would result in 200 options. If the stock goes to $400, your calls would increase by $100 resulting in twice the gains as buying stocks (I.e. $200 worth of gains).  If the price drops to $200, you would lose $200, but you'd still have capital through your itm calls (whereas your theoretical atm calls would lose almost all of their value).

You do lose the dividend payments but you can always do a PMCC and leverage the leaps to sell OTM call option contracts in the short term hoping they expire worthless to collect premiums as opposed to collecting dividends.

2021-04-11 22:39:31,stocks,"Sorry, but 0.5 delta does not mean 50% leverage.

Leverage is calculated as = (Share Price x Delta)/Option Price

AAPL is currently trading at 133. The ATM strike for the 5/21 call with 46DTE currently has 0.52 delta and costs $5.70. You would be

&#x200B;

(133 x 0.52)/5.70 = 12.1 times leveraged compared to using that same amount of money to purchase shares

&#x200B;

If I had $10,000 cash right now I could buy:

10,000/133 = 75.19 shares of AAPL

or

10,000/$570 = 17.54 contracts of the 5/21c

&#x200B;

If delta = 0.52 then a $1 increase in share price from $133 to $134 represents a 0.752% increase and my shares would be worth $10,075

On the other hand my call options would increase from $5.70 to $6.22 or a 9.1% increase. My total option position would be $10,910."

2021-04-11 23:53:28,stocks,"I was specifically talking about people who bought LEAPS on AMZN in mid-July when it was $3200. It has been trading in the range of $3000-$3300 for the past 8 months, and people with LEAPs have lost money due to time decay.

Also, people like the OP who buy LEAPs tend to hold and roll LEAPs as opposed to day trade it, hence my example.

My point was for long-term holders (shares or LEAPs), and I think shares are a much safer way to do it. Sure with LEAPs you can get triple or quadruple the return but if also if the stock (or the market) stagnates or pulls back for a few months, the shareholder is fine but the LEAP holder has lost a good chunk due to time decay. It's basically a race against time even tho the time horizon is longer than for a short-term contract."

Right and it all just ends up right around the same as it was 9 months ago.

2021-04-12 09:17:03,stocks,Gambling on naked calls vs owning equity is very different buddy
2021-04-12 01:01:27,stocks,"Far OTM calls are cheaper (you can buy more contracts) and will gain more as it becomes ITM.  The downside is if the stock doesn‚Äôt move towards the strike price it will decay in value as well. Most people buy OTM calls with at least 0.2 delta. As far as IV is concerned, it depends on the stock. Look at the historical IV and decide for yourself. For eg: for Tesla an IV of less than 75 would be a great buy.


Also if you decide to buy options, make sure you understand how Greeks work otherwise you will experience a lot of pain and won‚Äôt understand where you went wrong."
2021-04-12 02:53:05,stocks,"Severely optimistic, lol."
2021-04-12 01:20:15,stocks,"

The risk with the far OTM calls is that the breakeven is likely much higher than the strike.  So even if it hits your strike price on expiration, the stock will need to be higher based on how much premium you paid.


And it really depends on your risk tolerance, everyone has different investment goals.  So those are things you have to determine for yourself.  


Regarding what IV is too much or is considered ""safe"":
I'd say when you're buying options lower IV is generally better, and the inverse is true if you're selling options.  But it's not always possible to wait for IV to drop, especially on Long-term options, so it's better to determine what the correct price of the stock will be and allow for some wiggle room.

There isn't a ""safe"" IV % imo as it's just one component of options pricing.  I recommend heading over to r/options to ask questions there, you can find more context on options pricing."

2021-04-12 10:16:27,stocks,"Time decay is already factored in due to it being a component of the equation used to derive option prices.

Let me just add on that if your gamma is high (which is typically highest for ATM near dated options), a small change in the underlying will result in larger changes in your delta so the leverage ratio can swing wildly."
2021-04-11 22:52:56,stocks,"Lol it's ok. Also, I don't want to be the guy that goes ""well AcKsHuALLY"" but 0.5 delta does not mean 50% leverage on LEAPS either.

(135 x 0.58)/24.65 = 3.17 leverage

Since the option price can be derived from strike, share price, expiration date, implied volatility and the interest rate, the leverage will be very different for each and every contract in the chain and across different tickers.

I recently (April 2020) invested $5000 (10% of my savings didn‚Äôt want to go crazy) into qantas an Australian airline company, here is my reasoning;

- The stock market had one of the biggest crashes since GFC, Qantas had gone from $6.3 to $2.3

- Being Qantas is one of the largest airline companies in the world also the third oldest, having this cashflow and reputation I thought they would be the most likely to open back up operation when coronavirus ends and even on the off chance be a monopoly of the Australian airline market (at least for a little while aha).

-airline stocks are obviously not desirable or demanded in a time like this as international and even domestic flights ceased, but in the future will most likely increase.

 - people instead of investing in this time are saving it for future hardship, I would rather invest some of my capital rather than keep it in a >1%p.a bank account.

Those were the reasons I invested a portion of my savings, again I am no expert and would love feedback on my decision! Currently the stock is sitting at 5.5$ and growing! International travel hasn‚Äôt even opened back up in Australia so I am excited to see if it goes even higher."

But it‚Äôs headed down and I know ol kathy wood has a crazy prediction for the company but just wondering what some of you thought about holding the company for the next 5- 10 years

2021-04-12 00:18:29,stocks,"A few things to keep in mind, coming from a long term shareholder myself with TSLA being a disproportionate weight of my account...

US infrastructure bill will likely disproportionately benefit TSLA. Right now, the old EV $7,500 is still available for all autos except TSLA & GM. Potential to be $10k credit, uncapped, which would be a boon to TSLA sales. They also are massively expanding SuperCharger networks & potentially opening up to all EV's, not just TSLA EV's. The infrastructure bill also has funding for charger networks. 2 big wins coming this year for TSLA on the incoming infrastructure bill alone. There also seems to be an emphasis on US manufactured EV's would only be eligible.

2 new gigafactories should go online this year (Texas & Berlin), doubling the manufacturing footprint and opening up a local manufacturer to cater to the European markets. Potential to build out a new gigafactory in India next.

2 new vehicle lines likely to be delivered by later year or by Q1 2021. Semi & CyberTruck. Semi's already have orders in the que, plus plans are in motion for the Megacharger network to support them.

Q1 2021 deliveries beat. Check out the YOY % increase. Also realize, no model S or X were delivered in Q1 due to the refresh. These are the higher margin cars so we should see the demand pushed to Q2 deliveries. I am bullish we may see 1M deliveries for this year.

You have a good cost basis on this to whether any storms though by holding it long. Plus we already seen capitulation occur with TSLA retracing to $550 from $800's. I've substantially increased TSLA's weight in my account recently on the dip, bought more after Q1 deliveries beat. But my thesis & conviction is my own. Do your own DD & always take profits if you feel it would be an appropriate time because stocks don't always go up."

2021-04-11 21:44:38,stocks,"I purchased Tesla to hold long term, not planning on selling before 2030 without big changes to the company.

Looking at the upcoming year(s) there are significant things (In my option) to watch for such as: Cybertruck & Semi deliveries, Berlin Model Y deliveries, ramping production of the new 4680 battery cells, increases in grid scale battery installations, and updates to the FSD beta."
2021-04-12 06:22:55,stocks,"The problem with TSLA is the mindless fans who make disgusting claims of future valuation.

Yes, maybe TSLA increases EV sales but that ultimately means nothing due to slim profit margins.  It‚Äôs also worth noting that legacy auto is aggressively expanding into the EV space with VW already in position to become the market share leader.  Tesla interiors are also sub standard leaving them with no actual product for the ‚Äúluxury‚Äù market.

Yes, maybe Tesla solar panels take off as more and more people add them to their homes.

Yes, maybe Tesla powerwall starts selling due to the concept of virtual power plants and distributed energy grids.

Both solar panels and power walls require a large sum of capital in order to even consider them.  Do you see individuals refinancing their homes in order to afford these additions?  Are new homes being built with them already installed?  The actual growth of these products are questionable - and at the current prices and the constant flux of ‚Äúnew breakthroughs‚Äù no one wants to be holding the bag on an outdated system especially due to their current cost.

Autonomous driving - this is the topic that kind of annoys me.  This idea that TSLA is just a few days from launching a self driving robo taxi service that is going to justify its current and future valuations.  It‚Äôs absurd on its face.  We are no where near close to this happening.  We very well may not even be there by 2030.  And frankly - with the way people treat an uber... you really think sending out unmanned taxis won‚Äôt be absolutely trashed?  Are you going to get in the self driving taxi that had some trash and used heroin needles and on the floors and dried cum on the seat left by the last passenger?  People have this tainted idea of how amazing things can be without realizing how shitty real life people actually make them.  And even if full autonomous driving happens - people mistakenly act like it solely benefits TSLA and no one else.

Elon - betting against Elon.  Elon made SpaceX and you see all the cool stuff they‚Äôre doing.  And?  SpaceX is an entirely independent company and has no actual impact on TSLA value.  SpaceX will eventually be its own public company as will Starlink.  Let‚Äôs stop pretending like SpaceX is some type of evidence of TSLA‚Äôs future success."

2021-04-11 21:12:21,stocks,It all depends on your views And optimism of the company. Do you think it‚Äôs worth almost 650 billion !?
2021-04-12 11:38:01,stocks,I think Tesla is a good hold for the next 5-10 because the EV market is really going to boom in the next 5-10 at least that is what the general sentiment is. Also 5-10 years is considered a long term hold not medium term.
2021-04-12 13:38:28,stocks,"I think Tesla is an excellent hold for the 5-10 year period at a reasonable percentage of your portfolio that aligns with your opinion of Tesla‚Äôs valuation. 

I would suggest doing your own valuation exercise, but I expect TSLA will return close to 20% per year on my valuation exercise (with a bearish scenario of only 1% per year, meaning Tesla simply grows into the current valuation and nothing more). I forecast that although Tesla might grow BEV market share in 2021 and 2022, that their BEV market share will be significantly eroded back down to about 23% by 2025 or about 3.75 million vehicles (a reasonable ~4% of global car market share and actually missing Tesla‚Äôs own long term targets) and that would make up 72% of their revenue in 2025. The rest of the revenue comes from energy, car service, autonomous package sales, charging, software, and insurance (notice I‚Äôm not including robotaxis). In this scenario, I predict $233.5 billion revenue and a net profit of ~$28 billion, leading us to a 2025 share price of $1,592 and a valuation similar to Apple today."
2021-04-12 16:22:07,stocks,"I bought 55 shares years ago when Tesla was at $50. I'm very risk-adverse and have most of my stuff in index funds, so Tesla was bought on a whim and then promptly forgotten about. When I realized what the stock had blown up to, I sold half the shares at a bit over $700. A tidy profit to shove back into the index funds and a couple other whim stocks. The rest I'm sitting on just for the fun of it, to see what happens.

At only 5.5 shares, your investment is less than a thousand dollars, right? It's no big deal if you lose that money long-term, and your gains if you sold now aren't so substantial that it makes much of a difference. So why not hold it, unless you have a different investment that you desperately want to put that money to?"
2021-04-12 03:00:17,stocks,"I would take some profits to be honest. I really don't see the huge potential the stock has from this price now. A 50% growth each year until 2030 is already priced in, and they will miss it at some point (again). FSD is just not really more than a Level 2 system with potential to be a level 3 system. Level 4/5 is nowhere near and the whole robotaxi narrative won't work. Tesla can't grow as fast as the EV market, they will loose market share and be a 5-10% market share producer of EVs. Their energy business is tiny and unprofitable. Where is all the value?"
2021-04-11 21:17:02,stocks,"Absolutely, they are way ahead of the pack when it comes to both the car and the advanced manufacturing, no one even is close. People had high hopes for VW, Porsche, GM and others to beat Tesla but all their plans are far behind.

Not only that, even if these companies manage to take over the personal car business from them. Tesla is the only company who is benefitting from the entire set of related technologies that are based on batteries, including home and municipal energy storage, home solar, Semis, high end sports cars, etc. one company may manage to beat it in one sector, but Tesla will win in most if not all the sectors they compete in.

In those 5-10 years we will arrive at a time where Tesla have many customers fully in their grip with Tesla solar on the roof feeding electricity to Tesla power walls and Tesla cars. True that won‚Äôt be everybody, but even if they get 5-10 percent of customers like that, they will be bigger than Apple."
2021-04-11 21:11:35,stocks,"I'm holding, even though I have way too much.  I bought it as a long-term hold and the reasons why I bought it hasn't changed, so it is still a long-term hold.   

I just wish that both my tax bracket was lower right now, andif that was true, that I had dumped some of it at the peak.   But, as it is now, I have too much but I don't want to take the hit to sell it, since I'm comfortable it's a good long-term hold."
2021-04-11 22:27:26,stocks,If you don't mind the insane volatility then I'd say yes. The risk/reward upside is huge.
2021-04-11 23:48:54,stocks,I‚Äôm in pretty deep but got in at 80 presplit. Tbh I ask myself the same question and I ended up buying a little more at 600. Might sell that as I have been doing some trading with Tesla but I plan on holding at least one hundred shares of my original presplit purchase. I already got out everything I put in and enough to buy a Tesla in profit. I just have a gut feeling this could be a big stock 5-10 years from now

2021-04-11 23:41:22,stocks,"Copy and pasted from an earlier post. 

Just wanted to add being first to the market doesn't always mean you keep dominance in the market. Let's not talk about Nokia or BB before AAPL and Samsung became powerhouses. 

1.) TSLA is way overvalued. The only thing TSLA has that is unique is the software and eMPG. As competition heats up, many other EV makers will be able to compete with eMPG or even be innovative in this space. Hyundai already has a model with solar panels. VW has project trinity, which will compete with charge times and distance. 

2.) TSLA will face way more regulation when their AP goes past level 2. They recently told CA DMV that FSD is not capable of autonomous driving.

3.) I own a TSLA, and I can tell you there are many situations where the drive assist just goes nuts. I feel like many people who comment on FSD either do not own a TSLA or have not experienced it. FSD is likely not close no matter what Elon says. Even if it becomes reality relatively soon, people will not trust it and TSLA isn't licensing their software out, yet. VW CEO was interested, but I think they s

4.) Other companies are making AP or have lane assist already. A Ford exec called TSLA vaporware. I'm not sure if you are aware, but there is also a story about TSLA deactivating someone who bought a used car with AP.

5.) People like to cite that Cathie is buying TSLA. Michael Burry put out a huge short against TSLA. Also, what do people expect Cathie to do? She is not gonnna talk shit about  the biggest holding in some of her ARK funds. 

6. TSLA became profitable based upon how many cars they sell. They are doing well right now, but back in 2015 when I invested they were losing money. I believe they actually were staying afloat mostly by government subsidies. I don't think they became profitable until 2019. Direct competition will steal market share. I am sorry, no matter what people believe some poeple will only buy a certain car make. 

7. That Toyota article with TSLA collab shouldn't really be taken seriously at this point. The thread in this subreddit point out enough valid points. 


8. Nobody has seen a street legal Cybertruck

9. Shifterless seems like a horrible idea

10. I'm not gonna trust a semi with lane assist.

11. I do not think government contracts will go to TSLA, but rather GMC or F. I think TSLA got phased out of the subsidy since it was considered a luxury vehicle. 

I think the best case scenario is either bitcoin blows up. 

Or TSLA merges w/ SpaceX. 

The BTC investment shows to me how erratic Elon is. He fought so long to be against crypto and then randomly just bought in. Tax and payment with BTC seems like a nightmare, too. 

The fact that Elon even thinks TSLA is overvalued says something. He said this when TSLA was 150 post split. In addition, when asked about his direct competion, he said AAPL. 

I could go on, but I figured these were the main points.

BTW, wanted to add the tidbit about the LV tunnel with Boring CO. I saw a video with Meet Kevin, a YT, and he totally pumped up the sentiment for TSLA even though Boring Co didn't deliver on shit they promised. I instantly blocked him. I was shocked he had 1.5m subscribers."
2021-04-11 22:13:09,stocks,They are about to get rewritten by wall street and go parabolic. Every estimate is far under what the reality is. They are growing way faster than people realize.

2021-04-12 00:40:12,stocks,"The company is currently valued as much as the world's five largest automakers combined.  While it has a very strong future and very good potential.... it would be insane to buy in now.  It's worth now what it's expected to be worth in 5-10 years at the high end.

Tesla is like the day traders special right now with how much it fluxuates."

2021-04-11 21:28:04,stocks,"It seems to be valued around $680 currently and will likely continue to range from $630 to $750.  Its highs were seen earlier this year but were likely inflated due to its inclusion in the S&P 500, wherein it was overbought."
2021-04-12 04:53:46,stocks,"Not just a good 5-10 year hold, it's probably the best when looking at risk/reward. There is almost no downside if they keep executing like they are. Worst case I would see them trading flat for the rest of the decade. Best case, they solve robotaxis and become the the largest company in the world.

I've recently done some projections on the opportunity of robotaxis, and people how no idea how massive the opportunity is. Whichever company can get market dominance in this field will make any other business look like a local lemonade stand, and Tesla is the only company working on this at the moment as it cannot be done with geofencing in the foreseeable future, which is what all the others are using.

If they do manage to hit their targets of producing around 20M cars in 2030 AND they solve robotaxis before then (obviously a best-case scenario, but still), they could easily be doing $500B of high margin SAAS revenues per year. That is almost 20x what Apple is doing today in total revenue... Even if they fall short of that by 75% they'd still be the most valuable company in the world.

And then there's still the energy side of their business. Energy is the largest market in the world, and Tesla's poised to disrupt all of it, and nobody is counting this into their models yet because it's too difficult to predict at this stage."
2021-04-11 21:18:11,stocks,No they will be outperformed by VW  and GM in EV sales. Their stock i fueled by hopes and dreams.

I think the next 10 years or more of rapid growth is already priced into the company. You‚Äôd need to hold it for a lot longer than 5-10 years if you want to see any reasonable return on your money. That‚Äôs just my opinion though."

Problem is that the market has priced in all that growth and more, so really what happens is best case your stock stays flat for ten years or it crashes and grows with the company, or it could shock me and go to the moon, but all of teslas growth over the next decade is priced in."

2021-04-12 03:13:15,stocks,Hell yeah
2021-04-12 06:40:32,stocks,"If they are just an automotive company, they are way overvalued. What is the entire market cap of automakers? 2-3 trillions? Just search what are the sales number of Toyota, GM or VW and their market cap and ask yourself how much should TSLA sell just to justify the current valuation.

2nd point would be that there is little to no variety in their models. If everybody drives a Model 3 than they start to lose the shiny new thing appeal.

3rd point would be that the EV have a bigger lifetime (or at least this is what they claim) so once you flood the market that's it or you need to start to make them obsolete somehow (wink wink, SW updates with performance penalty). Most people won't sell their car without a economic reason.

4th EVs are still more expensive than ICE. You'll get your money back after a big number of kms/miles, money which you pay upfront.

5th They are not present worldwide yet.

So they have to become something more than an automotive company (even if we assume that they'll dominate the auto market like maybe no one ever did) with other streams of revenue beside car sales."

Everyone is piling on GM, but I don‚Äôt like GM cars, nor the company. They use shitty parts. Now VW is a different story to me IMO. They engineer good parts. I do my own maintenance and I can tell the difference between a well engineered and non-engineered part. There is just simply more quality and thought into it when it comes to being replaced."

Charging with a non Tesla EV is an absolutely miserable experience unless you are charging at home or can while you are getting groceries.

Want to buy an EV and take it out of town on road trips and dont have charging at home? Good luck. 3rd party chargers are a gamble if they even work and usually charge at only level 2 making you stuck at a charger for a couple hours in many situations.

Tesla's supercharging network is going to be a huge advantage for a long time. VW cant just build a car just as good. They have to figure out how to make a massive 3rd party charging network reliable (good luck)."

Tesla is already an operating profit margin leader in the auto industry (6.3% in 2020 which is second only to Toyota) and they still are realizing massive operating leverage as revenue and gross profit grow much faster than operating expenses, resulting in large gains in the operating margin.

>It‚Äôs also worth noting that legacy auto is aggressively expanding into the EV space with VW already in position to become the market share leader.  Tesla interiors are also sub standard leaving them with no actual product for the ‚Äúluxury‚Äù market.

VW is most certainly not in a position to become THE market share leader in EVs. Not even close. Maybe a market share leader, but definitely not THE market share leader. VW‚Äôs target is for 1.5 million pure EV sales in 2025. Tesla is shooting for 1 million units in 2021 and 50% year over year unit sales growth for the next several years, likely through 2025. The result is Tesla is shooting for 4-5 million vehicles in 2025 which is about 3x VW‚Äôs goal, and will surpass VW‚Äôs 2025 goal in 2022. By the way, Tesla has expanded global BEV market share 3 years in a row now, basically doubling over the period from 12.8% to 23% despite new market entrants in many markets worldwide. In 2021, Tesla will likely again grow market share despite new entrants and take >25% market share of BEVs.

As for your ‚Äúluxury‚Äù comment, the new ‚Äúluxury‚Äù for many people isn‚Äôt opulent physical interiors, but the software and tech in their cars, which Tesla is hands down a leader in.

The rest of your points are hand wavey and not very substantive, so I won‚Äôt comment. However I do want to address your comment about valuation:

> The problem with TSLA is the mindless fans who make disgusting claims of future valuation.

I suggest you share with us some details about your valuation since I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve done an exercise. I forecast that although Tesla might grow BEV market share in 2021 and 2022, but after that their market share will be significantly eroded back down to about 23% by 2025 or about 3.75 million vehicles (a reasonable ~4% of global car market share and actually missing Tesla‚Äôs own long term targets) and that would make up 72% of their revenue in 2025. The rest of the revenue comes from energy, car service, autonomous package sales, charging, software, and insurance (notice I‚Äôm not including robotaxis). In this scenario, I predict $233.5 billion revenue and a net profit of ~$28 billion, leading us to a 2025 share price of $1,592 and a valuation similar to Apple today."

Legacy autos are less efficient due to their age and size. 

That's why Tesla has the best specs dollar for dollar. When Tesla stops dumping money into expanding and they show higher profits, people will have missed out on buying TSLA low.

How high is the chance that only Tesla can manage that alone and no other car manufacturer? Most of the fundamental logic is open source and published by many universities worldwide. And additionally we probably need years alone to make driverless cars street legal.

In terms of autonomous driving Tesla is not ahead of anybody. There are several other companies that can do the same as Tesla currently.

I would highly recommend researching what Tesla is doing within the energy sector. Energy storage and AI driven energy utility management is the future of the energy sector as a whole. If Tesla can turn their Autobidder software into the leading platform for energy distribution through the use of their supercomputer that's coming online this year (and will be the most powerful in the world), they will dominate the energy sector. Especially in combination with their individual and enterprise storage solutions.

Obviously there's still a lot of ifs about their energy businesses though, which is why it's so difficult to predict.

At his expense?  Tesla is not going to give them away for free. They will license them which will be HUGE for stockholders.

Using a Tesla app at a Tesla charger surrounded by Tesla vehicles. That will sway some people to change their next car to Tesla.   Some people can't handle FOMO.

If you think teslas margins are bad, you haven't seen GMs. Tesla leads in EV production. That's the reason why the legacy autos are dragging their feet. Legacy autos have to support the dealership model. To sell at a competitive price they have to lower their margins so the dealership can take their cut. Every EV a dealership sells is less money going into their service center. They are disincentivized to sell EVs too.

Transitioning to EV is costly and margins are lower. Every EV VW sells is one less ICE car they sell. They are eating into their own profits.

Tesla isn't as concerned with profits. They are reinvesting for growth.

Tesla will dominate the EV space and it is due to the ""mindless fans"". The only other company I can think of with such a loyal fan base is Apple. Where there's such a strong following there will always be high demand."

They don't want to transition. They make way more money in ICE cars. The only reason why they make EVs is to avoid the penalties.

So it doesn't matter if the credits stay or go. Either is a win for Tesla.

In all seriousness, emission credits won't just stop existing and legacy autos won't just stop making EVs. They already have the production lines. They definitely won't invest anymore into it and they won't push EV cars as much.

But I'm a firm believer the only reason why Tesla has any competition is because of emission credits forcing legacy autos hand. They don't want to pay Tesla anymore."

2021-04-12 06:41:17,stocks,"It sure can, but hasn't yet"
2021-04-12 12:47:19,stocks,"That was due to the expectation of interest rates controlled by the fed. 

Theoretically the more costly it is to borrow money the less companies can grow. Tesla is still very much in its expansion phase.

It's volatile because there are a lot of variables during growth and certain people and funds cant handle that unknown. It's also volatile because short sellers can make a lot of money with volatility. Just like how Jim Cramer can pump stocks, short sellers can create fear uncertainty and doubt so people dump stocks. In the long run Tesla hasn't stopped growing and won't stop growing."
2021-04-12 07:49:28,stocks,"You do realize that the value is dynamic right? What you're saying makes no sense. Whole point of investment advice is to be able to adapt to the ever changing market.

Edit: I'm not pro/con Tesla, but I do realize an outlier company when I see one. Tesla is one of those. They can easily bust just as fast they rocketed. It's obvious that too many people's biases obscure the  valuation of this company, which is always reflected in the current price. That's how markets work."
2021-04-11 21:48:14,stocks,I try doing my own DD but it definitely helps when there‚Äôs a lot of smarter people on here that have looked into it as well and have different opinions.
2021-04-11 22:00:09,stocks,"amen to u/goldenboy_100 .   if I had to invest in the market now, I would have trouble finding a stock that actually is not severely overvalued by historical metrics.  stocks are worth what people are willing to pay for them, not what they are worth on a discounted cash value.  My God, im seriously thinking about going back to the dart board....  irrational is the new normal haha...."
2021-04-12 00:01:28,stocks,What are companies that you look at that you believe will make you money? I'm looking for companies to research and invest in.

I mean, if you want to have fun belonging to the club of hopeful millionaires, dreaming of 10x returns and talking smugly all togheter about how your darling is gonna conquer the world, while selectively listening only to voices that reinforce your enjoyment, sure.

You will likely be paying for the good times, thought. Like an Exclusive Club membership.

Or you could listen to everyone saying that Tesla is not worth the asking price, and it‚Äôs unlikely to be worth it even in ten years, and don‚Äôt invest, and remain alone and bored.
But what about the dreams you will be missing on?? The community?? WHERE IS THE FUN IN THAT??"
2021-04-11 21:33:54,stocks,Does that sound right to you ??
2021-04-12 08:04:51,stocks,">How high is the chance that only Tesla can manage that alone and no other car manufacturer? Most of the fundamental logic is open source and published by many universities worldwide.

No other company currently is taking the same approach as Tesla with it Data lead and it own Neural Network to train on Dojo(made specifically to train it's FSD Neural Network A.I.)(also Tesla could let others use this Dojo in the future for their needs like AWS does). 

Waymo has somewhat a chance in that market if they can solve a few problems their system has of cost/scalability. The system Waymo uses is very expensive. The system Tesla using is already on most Tesla cars out there maybe need like a new hardware computer and an update.

The future is going to be excited for us Tech addicts :)."

2021-04-11 22:38:42,stocks,50 miles is 80.47 km
2021-04-12 00:31:21,stocks,Thats why üòÇ
2021-04-11 22:53:43,stocks,"Strange, I haven't experienced anything you've said as fact lol.

Truth is from a real owner of 7 years (since '14), I've truly never had a cheaper maintenance bill then the tesla. Only things that went wrong were under warranty 1) broken door handle which if I had to pay out of pocket now is only $200. There was some rubber molding on my sunroof that was damaged but that was free through goodwill. Goodwill is something I never experienced at Chevrolet, GM, Jeep, Infiniti, or Jaguar. Goodwill is when they repair your car out of warranty for NO FEE. 

Brakes last over 100k miles due to regenerative braking. No oil changes, no fiter changes, no motor work requires.

Tesla suggests a 1 time yearly check of the vehicle, if all is good then there is now work to do. This year I did all the recommendations since I skipped last 2 years and it cost me $380. I'll be good for another year or 2. 

I still have my infiniti suv and a jeep, both with warranties and I have paid more out of pocket even with warranty then I have with the Tesla now out of warranty. 

My authorized repair shop is a little far at about 15 miles, but it's no big deal because I don't have to go there. They will come work on the car in my driveway if it's easy. If not Rudy tow it and return it when the work is finished. 

Tesla WILL NEVER send a code to disabled your vehicle if you've been on an accident lmao, that is funny!

As far as the trade in value, i've yet to cross that bridge as I have not had any mind to sell, matter fact been thinking about buying another one!

The kinks are getting worked out."
2021-04-11 22:20:21,stocks,"Where the hell did you read that?
A dude in NY has a shop, he specializes in fixing crashed/totaled Tesla‚Äôs and has a YouTube channel."

2021-04-12 00:18:52,stocks,True

2021-04-12 12:18:49,stocks,">Tesla will dominate the EV space and it is due to the ""mindless fans"".

I dont know what your definition of mindless fans is but agree the overall brand power is really the catalyst. Its going to be like when young adults and kids are looking down on others for not having iPhones (even if in some cases the Android is more expensive, They just assume its a lesser value product). Its gross but its true.

I already see more kids aware of Tesla than they are of BMW, Audi, etc.

Tesla's brand power has set themselves up for a very successful future."
2021-04-12 15:17:58,stocks,"I don't think he was saying it will disappear.
But if more auto makers starts to only produce EV, there will not be anyone to sell the carbon credits to."
2021-04-12 13:13:36,stocks,Tell that to PG&E which replaced their Moss Landing gas peaker with energy storage. Or you can tell that to the leading industry cost analysts at Lazard who estimate gas peaker levelized cost of energy at $150-$200/MWh and utility scale energy storage for the wholesale market at  $132-$245/MWh standalone and $81-$124/MWh when paired with solar (and that report was release BEFORE Tesla started selling the megapack for >40% less than any other storage products they sold before).

2021-04-12 12:58:39,stocks,"Tesla can't really bust. They've established themselves as a world wide car manufacturer. They produce a good car that makes money.

TSLAs valuation is another story. That's is dependant on growth. I don't see their growth halting. 

People say the legacy autos are eating into teslas market share but how is that possible when Tesla doesn't even have any inventory sitting around. And they only have 2% of the car market. 

I don't see the other manufacturers out producing Tesla on EVs. They have little incentive too when their ICE cars make more money. The only reason they have invested in EVs is because they don't want to pay Tesla for emission credits."
2021-04-11 21:55:35,stocks,"If you look at fundamentals of the company, their valuation does not make sense based on current profitability of the company. BUT some people will argue that you are paying for the a premium and that eventually the company will be worth more then that. Tesla is definitely ahead of the game when it comes to EV the question is are they going to continue with this.   It‚Äôs a great topic Tesla."
2021-04-11 22:19:39,stocks,If you want to compare them then look at their over all revenue and where and how it is generated.  This is a reason why research is so important rather then listening to social media or people who use it.

They average just over $3,500 in profit/car."
2021-04-11 21:50:43,stocks,"no, their market cap is ~1.6 mil per vehicle sold (last I looked).  its a growth company, but thats one HELL of a growth curve to justify that market cap.  think of it this way, if you sold widgets for $1 each, could you justify in front of shark tank a market cap (business valuation) of $25 PER widget sold (not profit, per sale)?"
2021-04-11 21:48:54,stocks,Ahh ok thank you for the clarification
2021-04-12 11:58:17,stocks,"Yes but still machines has to modified, production lines have to be arranged, specialized machines making gas engines has to be taken out of the way, all that cost time and money."
2021-04-12 01:02:28,stocks,"At 7 years you shouldn‚Äôt have hardly any problems. (Yet).  My f150 is 12 years old and besides fluid changes ive only had a fan blower resistor ($60), brake pads ($100?), set of rotors (($100?), and a set of calipers($100?) 

Of course ev has lower maintenance, the problem is when something does go wrong its going to be way more expensive.  A prius battery is what $5k? Regen braking im sure is way way more than a set of calipers but you have those too which will go out as well.  Electric motors which will go out, think those will be at least a few grand a piece.  Sensors, computers, solar panels?  

The more complicated something is the more expensive, thats why used lambos arnt really suggested for wsbers as daily drivers.

Short term less Maintenance, long term it quickly catches up to you.  Which like i was saying is when rich people will start dumping them, and the little guys start buying, and they get burned on it because they cant afford it, then it creates a feedback loop.

Also right now most tesla users are in the big states, here it‚Äôs probably 100+ miles to the nearest authorized repair shop."
2021-04-11 22:27:38,stocks,"Youtube, guy had a tesla that was water damaged got it cheap, he either tried to fix it or swap the computer into another tesla, long story short after he spent all the time getting it put together and everything fixed, he realized it was locked somehow, and from what i remember he tried calling tesla and they wouldnt activate it because it showed a salvage title or whatever on the computer.  Basically tesla is the apple of cars, eventually every part could be chipped to the car.  You really think the future with automatic driving is going to have any place or room for people repairing their cars at a non authorized repair shop?  The whole point is control over the car and the driver, if people can simply over ride that then it defeats the purpose"
2021-04-12 03:46:12,stocks,"i really want to see robo taxis soon but i think this is how people react to them. somewhere around 38k die each year in the US in car accidents with millions injured and we accept it. Robo taxis though, if they arent substantially safer then a very vocal group will complain about them. Even if they are proven to be safer they will not accept them unless they are very very safe. hope im wrong.."

2021-04-12 13:16:01,stocks,I'd be interested in knowing how much of those costs are subsidised by the Californian government
2021-04-12 09:57:23,stocks,"Do the maths, those batteries can maybe provide power for a couple of hours max, before being drained. There is no competition with gas peaker plants, especially when the natural gas beats it massively by price. 

Also the carbon cost of building those mineral intensive huge batteries, and the amount of toxic waste they will leave behind, how is this even a green solution?

Point is. It will take time, for such tools to be widely available for Tesla cars."

2021-04-11 22:57:58,stocks,"GM's only experience with electric vehicles thus far is a crappy ass chevy bolt, they'll have ALOT of proving to do."
2021-04-12 01:13:48,stocks,"Yes they are. You are judging GM on vehicles that don't even publicly exist yet. The Ford Mustang Mach-E test drives are showing much left to be desired due to wonky charging and a user experience that falls a bit flat. You also have to take into account all of the negative financial impacts that will come from traditional automakers cannibalizing their own sales and shuttering core competencies like engine and drivetrain plants. There are a lot of legacy costs and expensive pensions that will have to be overcome that Tesla simply does not have. I think at least one of the US big 3 will fold trying to make the leap. My money is on Stellantis/FCA.

Volkswagen was quick to shift to electric a few years ago and their offerings are very intriguing. The Taycan (Porsche owned by VW) seems to be a great vehicle to work down the price ladder from. I think Rivian has serious legs as long as their production vehicles roll out well this year. Its also hard to count Toyota Group out even though they have been very quiet. I think its very possible that Tesla could jump out to grab as much as 15-20% of the car market. In the US, that's 3.5M Cars and in the rest of the world perhaps as high as another 8-10 Million. We are seeing that they are at low level 3 Autonomy in the Beta software right now, V9.0 might put them firmly there. If Tesla gets to SAE Level 4 autonomy first, 20% is highly likely, if they get to Level 5 the game changes completely.

Hard to bet against the company with nearly all the cars on the road, nearly all the autonomy data, a war chest full of cash, other revenue streams besides vehicles, and no legacy costs to hold it back. Also keep in mind that while other automakers subcontract most of the parts for their cars out, Tesla is capturing the profits on a large majority of what goes into the car.

I will agree the stock price is high for the business they are doing right now today, but with such an upside and a lot of possible paths to get there its hard to bet against them."
2021-04-11 22:30:16,stocks,In my opinion they are

2021-04-11 22:44:57,stocks,"And take mear seconds for tesla to update their software to lock out those tools.  Do people work on apple phones, sure.  Is it far and few between, yes, and its still a pain in the ass and the price makes it only worth it for people with lots of cash.  Its also one of those deals where they will get more and more advanced making the previous models quickly obsolete.  Which doesnt happen nearly as fast with regular cars.  I mean theres a market for old cars,  i don‚Äôt really see that happening with ev, like who wants an old iphone 3 or whatever, it will happen to ev‚Äôs.  With nobody driving, the features/entertainment inside become more important."

2021-04-12 19:19:16,stocks,"Because china has the control over the materials, the mining, the supply chains. Solar panels require a lot of intensive mining."
2021-04-12 05:03:12,stocks,"I doubt they will reach 20% market share. You mentioned VAG and Toyota. You forgot BYD, HyundaiKia, PSA and RenaultNissan. Those are really big players. The Car Market is really settled. And the people try to buy domestic. 
The cannibalizing is not really a factor. Since the legacy car makers would have lost the sale to an EV maker anyway"
2021-04-12 13:35:32,stocks,"I agree with most things except Toyota. I can discount them because of the very reason they are quiet. They aren't doing anything.

The last bit of EV news out of them was their attempt at lobbying the US to slow down the rollout of EV.

You mention legacy autos cost of transitioning from ICE to EV. Toyota also has their hybrid division on top of that. 

Hybrid was a stepping stone and now is a joke yet Toyota is still pushing it because they've invested so much into it.

Toyota is betting on hydrogen or solid state batteries to be a big player in EV again. Until they have a breakthrough they'll be sitting on the sidelines."

The market literally has flying cars built into their market share.  You know what they dont have priced in? Anyone of the many manufacturers actually switching to ev, which is happening right now with hummer preorders and f150‚Äôs not much further behind.  

Why dont they have it priced in? Because they priced in flying fucking cars and moon tractors instead.  Sorry but this bubble only lasts another 5 years tops, all down hill from there considering half their profit is because the government subsidized them because they priced in flying cars too!"
2021-04-12 00:00:00,stocks,"How do American taxes work with losses? I have been reading up online on how taxes work for stocks, but what I have found seems unreasonable. It seems that if you earned a lot of money but then lost most of it, you still pay the taxes for the large sum of money initially gained and can only have $3k registered as loss per year. Is this correct?

Hypothetically, let's say someone used 1 million and made it to 10 million and then lost about 8 million, resulting in 2 million left, aka a profit of 1 million. So the end result is that they still have to pay around 3.5 million for that year since the 10 million is taxed at a high rate and they end up in debt after paying taxes. This sounds really unreasonable to me, so I feel like I am misunderstanding.

I know this is not the typical post here, but it doesn't seem to violate the rules from what I can read. If there is a better subreddit to ask this question, please tell me."
2021-04-11 21:23:19,stocks,"The following is slightly oversimplified, as there are lots of little gotchas in the code.  Plus I'm not a professional tax person so this might be slightly wrong (although I'm comfortable with the general details).

Let's assume in one calendar year you buy and sell stocks, and you have a $10 million gain and a 8 million loss.   You'd subtract the 8 million from the 10 million and pay taxes on the 2 million.

The next year your fate is reversed, you gain 8 million, and lose 10 million.   Now your losses are 2 million for that year.    However, the amount you can deduct is limited to $3K.   The remaining 1.997million of loss can be carried forward.

The next year you're back up.   10 million gain, 8 million loss.   Now you only have 2 million of profit, and you can subtract an additional 1.997 million that wasn't able to be used in the previous year, for a net gain of only $3K.

Now, if you're really making a 10 million gain in a year, there is a good chance you're a professional trader.   If you're a professional trader, you account for your gains and losses differently than the rest of us, effectively taking the gains and losses as they occur, not when you sell.   So if you have bought 1 million in VTI, and it's worth 1.1 million at the end of the year, you pay taxes on the .1 million, even if you don't sell it.   Same is true in the other direction, so if 1 million of VTI went down to 900K, you'd be able to take a $100K loss on your taxes immediately, even if you didn't sell it.   Because you're taking gains and losses due to the ""Mark to Market"" accounting you'd be using the IRS doesn't limit you to the $3K.

When I mentioned above that there are little gotchas along the way, I mean things like the wash sale rule, how long-term and short-term gains are treated differently, and so on."
2021-04-11 21:13:31,stocks,"It depends on the time frame we are talking about.  If your losses occur in the same taxable year as your gains, you‚Äôre only taxed on the net gain.  If the losses come the year after your gains, you‚Äôre limited to a 3,000 deduction in the year of the loss with the rest of your losses carried forward to the next taxable year to offset any gains you may get then."
2021-04-12 11:19:11,stocks,"You can essentially offset any gains with any losses with out limit. However, you can only claim a total overall loss of $3K in any given year. if you have losses that exceed $3K you can carry losses forward to other tax years. 

Said another way, you can only go net negative by $3K in any tax year. 

examples:

$10,000 gains $9,000 in loses. Net of $1,000 is taxable. 

$10,000 gains $12,000 losses, net of -$2,000 deduction to income on your taxes

$10,000 gains $15,000 in losses. The $3K limit hits, you may take a $3K deduction and then carry $2K to the next tax year."
2021-04-11 21:14:23,stocks,"I think that's how it is. When you make gains, always set some aside for taxes. Reinvesting it all will not excuse you from the taxes on your original gains, regardless if you made more or less on the reinvestment.

Edit: to clarify, gains are only when you sell the stock. If a stock goes up but you keep holding it, you don't pay taxes on that. ( unless Bernie Sanders or Warren get their way and tax that too)"
2021-04-11 21:10:10,stocks,"I'm no tax professional but it's my understanding that losses off set gains.

It's even a strategy used by some wealthier folk to sell stocks at a loss to change their taxable earnings.

But with so many categories and moving parts Im not sure how easy it is to do and track in the end."
2021-04-11 21:14:38,stocks,"You can take all the losses provided you don‚Äôt violate the wash sale rule.  
In your example, only $1,000,000 is taxable provided this all happened within the calendar year."
2021-04-11 21:21:14,stocks,"In that situation you would only pay taxes on 1 million. Assuming it was all sold in that year.

If you ended losing 9k you can only write off $3k but I believe that‚Äôs cumulative. So say for the next two years you were net $0, you could still write off $3k in losses"
2021-04-11 21:34:42,stocks,"I see. This seems much more reasonable. 

Out of curiosity, how do you get treated as a professional trader? Also, I am a little confused about the period of time between January and the actual day you pay taxes, because what if you lost money between during the same year you pay for the previous year's taxes? I am guessing this is why professional traders are treated differently. Presumably for a lay person just messing around, it wouldn't mean anything to the IRS?"
2021-04-11 23:48:04,stocks,"""The next year you're back up. 10 million gain, 8 million loss. Now you only have 2 million of profit, and you can subtract an additional 1.997 million that wasn't able to be used in the previous year, for a net gain of only $3K.""

This...does not sound right.

Unless I am reading this wrong. You can only carry forward 3k per year. You can't just carry over 1.97 million in losses from a prior year, the limit is 3 k. So basically if you lost 2 million in a year, you'll be deducting 3k for the rest of your life."
2021-04-11 23:45:55,stocks,"Capped at 3k a year, yes.

So a loss of 20k would take...20/3 years to fully deduct."

And would this be a wealth tax (millionaires and billionaires), or for all tax brackets?"
2021-04-11 21:52:27,stocks,"Taxes are always calculated and filed on a calendar year basis.   So your trades you do in 2020 apply to the tax return you file in 2021.   Trades that happen after December 31st end up on the next year tax return, in this example, it would be the 2022 tax return.

As far as the professional trader portion, you basically have to be be trading as a business.   There are a lot of hoops to jump through to do this, and generally if you're going to do this, you'll likely want to consult a tax and accounting professional since you're going to have a lot of paperwork to handle on an ongoing basis.

Edit: changed ""yearly basis"" to the more accurate ongoing basis."
2021-04-11 22:47:16,stocks,"A lot of people worry about the $3k rule when they are first getting started when really it isn't a concern for most - but you still need to be aware of it as it can affect your taxes a lot if you also have a day job. 

Let's use the same example as the above, but also assume you make $2mil a year owning a small business. The first year, you netted 2m from the business plus 2m from stocks - and so you pay taxes on an income of $4m. Year two you made $2m at your business and lost $2m in stocks. You make $0, but because you aren't a professional trader, you can only claim $3k in stock losses. So you now need to pay taxes on $1.997m (you did make $2m at your business after all; its not the IRS's fault you lost it playing the market). Year 3 you are able to claim the previous losses to offset at the first poster mentioned, meaning year 3 you are paying taxes on $2.003m even though you made 4. 

So in that scenario, you could be really screwed in year two. But this is also a scenario of someone losing a year's pay in stock losses. Don't overextend and don't invest what you can't afford to lose and this shouldn't normally happen."
2021-04-12 12:44:12,stocks,"To be classified as a pro, you need to do a number of trades a week and need to have a decent amount of money. Its really not worth it unless you are trading around 500k due to the cost of a cpa and stuff. There are better tax advantage for the regular person like trading in a roth ira account"
2021-04-12 01:40:36,stocks,"You can carry forward all of it.   Every year, the entire amount of carryforward from previous years is able to be applied to gains from trading stock in that year.

I think what you're missing is that the IRS treats capital losses in a different way than ordinary income.   It's in two separate buckets.  

Normally, capital losses are used to offset capital gains, and cannot generally be used to offset other income beyond 3K per year.   This means if you have a big loss, you cannot use the loss to offset any more than 3K of non-capital-gains income.

However, you CAN carry forward the loss into the next year, and if you have capital gains in the next year, you can use all of the remaining losses from previous years to offset capital gains in that year.   But, in the next year, you still cannot use more than 3K to offset other ordinary income.

Example:  

Year 1:  Net capital loss: 1Million.   You can use 3K to deduct from **ordinary** income and carry forward 997K.

Year 2: Net capital Gain: 500K.  You can use 500K of the carryforward to cancel 500K of your net gain.   And an additional 3K to deduct from other **ordinary income**.   You used 503K of your carryforward this year, so you now have 494K of your carryforward left.

Year 3: No trading gain or loss.  You have 494K of carryforward but with no net investment loss, you can only deduct $3K from otherordinary income.   491K of carryforward left.

Year 4: Finally, you have a great year:  750K of trading gains.   You have 491K of carryforward which means you have to pay taxes on your 259K gains, hopefully at the long-term capital gains rate.

I hope this helps you understand a bit more.

I will say that you are correct that a very big loss can take years to consume.  Especially if you have no capital gains.   For example, if you lost 1M in your first year trading you may just say no to investing at all outside of a tax-advantaged account.  In which case, you could only deduct the 3K per year since you probably wouldn't have many, if any, capital gains."

Year 1: 20k loss. Deduct 3k. 17k left to deduct.

Year 3. 2k gain -3k = -1k loss. 11k left.

2021-04-12 10:57:35,stocks,"First decide if you are planning to participate as an investor (long time frame) or trader (shorter time frame). Many beginners start out as one type, but if the trade/investment does not work out, mentally switch their mindset.

Investor: Since this is a long time frame mentally, it really does not matter if when you participate. You could wait a few days, weeks, or even months. No need to jump in during the emotional phase of the IPO/DPO.

Trader: For beginners, you really should set some limit orders. If you just click market buy, you could get caught up in the frenzy and end up buying in at too high a price just because you want to get in at the earliest price possible.

Earliest price does not always mean lowest price. Also, as general guidance, very few people ever catch things at the lowest or highest prices. It is okay if you do not get 100% of the price movements.

You could do some research to determine the price range that you are willing to buy in at. Then, you can set a ladder-type limit buy orders. For example, with 6k you could do something like this.

* Limit buy 1k at 50% of your target price
* Limit buy 1k at 75% of your target price
* Limit buy 1k at 80% of your target price
* Limit buy 1k at 90% of your target price
* Limit buy 1k at 100% of your target price
* Limit buy 1k at 125% of your target price

Good luck"

$RIG  - Possible support play closer to $3.10 or so, but if this trend survives it may be amazing. 

&#x200B;

$WMB  - Similar to $CNX and $SWN as well, gorgeous. I think we have a week on this one and some time to consolidate, but long term beautiful.

2021-04-11 23:19:29,stocks,I would buy whichever you feel is undervalued that month for instance say one of the picks you feel is currently worth 200 dollars but it's trading at 210 and another one you feel should be valued at 150 but is trading at 130 buy that one instead unless you want equal weight and dollar cost average each position every month

2021-04-12 00:32:33,stocks,I'd spread it around a bit more than just 5 stocks. Make your buying decisions month to month. Look at what ever dividend stock that satisfies your selection criteria and has the highest yield.

2021-04-12 12:37:22,stocks,"Well. Before taxes and fees, there‚Äôs no logical basis for you to prefer cash from a dividend over cashing from selling shares. Not to mention the presence of a dividend in no way suggests the stocks return will be better or worse. 


Dividends should be irrelevant to you the investor. Before taxes and fees, the only thing that should matter to you is the quality of the company."
2021-04-12 13:04:07,stocks,Hence blue chip aristocrat stocks. They are very stable.
2021-04-12 14:01:16,stocks,"Aye yai yai. 


You got a lot to learn. Just because it‚Äôs a blue chip stock doesn‚Äôt mean their fundamentals are good. That‚Äôs because, and I‚Äôll say it again, the presence of a dividend offers no indication the stock will be good or bad. This fact along with the ex date is the reason why dividends should be irrelevant to the investor when picking stocks. 


Also keep in mind. Just because your investments are in different accounts doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre independent from one another or that you‚Äôre reducing risk. If I have 90k in Tesla in one account, then I open a new account and put 10k in MSFT. My portfolio is still 90% in Tesla."

When you buy an etf, you are buying a stake in a company that has a stake in that dividend company.  Your dividend is related to whether or not that etf is willing to pay a dividend."

2021-04-11 20:51:25,stocks,That‚Äôs why you rebalance by buying more. One position getting to big then buy more of others.
2021-04-12 06:30:52,stocks,"Nothing is deducted from your account. An ETF can‚Äôt do that. The fund takes a little bit of the money the stocks make from paying dividends or while they are selling stocks to rebalance the portfolio, and they keep it for themselves. It‚Äôs a built in fee that you don‚Äôt actually notice."
2021-04-11 20:36:59,stocks,"When you pick the stocks instead of using an ETF you're putting more of your money in fewer baskets. For example, I love REITs so I have picked out around 5 REITs to invest in which means i have a concentration risk on those 5 companies. When you invest in an ETF your money tends to be spread out over however many companies are tracked by the ETF so you have less risk.


It's about your risk tolerance. I don't mind having such a high percentage of my portfolio on just 5 companies. It's not wise tbh but like the other person said you can usually enjoy higher returns since you can pick and chose what you invest in. I do still have several ETFs... so i keep a balance in my investing strategies."

I moved to REITs during the pandemic because a lot of them went on sale even though they have been able to continue to collect rents. So I'm I've been very bullish on REITs. I think the next addition to my dividend portfolio will be $MO. It has a 6% yield and it looks like they are making a move to weed.

I do like the Japanese market right now, so I tried looking into a few of the big conglomerates - Itochu, Mitsui, Sumitomo - but could not wrap my head around the business models.

The main things keeping me from adding more now is the delay on the FTC approval of the Speedway deal, delays in their entry into India due to the bankruptcy of their MLA partner, and their stubborn insistence on keeping their Japanese department stores even though they make fuck all in profits (Seven&i Holdings started out in department stores).

If and when the Speedway deal closes, their Indian market entry actually gets off the ground, and/or they sell their department stores I expect shares to pop more though."

Check out Yamaha Motors, they are big in agricultural vehicles too, plus they are putting in AI so the ag machines can run autonomously in the fields (fewer and fewer farmers are young enough to do physical work anymore).

2021-04-12 10:34:44,stocks,"Tbh you're not likely to find any high growth funds that fit your risk tolerance; if they existed then higher risk portfolios wouldn't need to exist. Lower risk generally means lower return but you know your money is mostly safe. I don't like mutual funds, because typically fund managers get paid the same salary regardless of whether their fund is performing well or not. But you can hire a stockbroker to manage a portfolio for you

You're best off talking to an advisor or broker who can find exactly what you are looking for rather than asking for opinions on Reddit."
2021-04-12 18:54:38,stocks,"I wouldn‚Äôt say being young means you *should* invest in high risk stuff, it just means your risk tolerance is way higher than someone who‚Äôs half way to retirement 

Basically ideally you start with an allocation to safe and aggressive strategies which slowly weight towards safe as you get older 

And being aggressive doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean yolo‚Äôing on stupid shit, it just means targeting the industries of the future rather than ones that have already proven themselves, preferably you‚Äôre getting some promising disruptive innovations @ non-hype levels. A lot of this stuff can make you a lot of money but the biggest mistake people make is seeing the growth, getting fomo, and getting burned. The key is getting this stuff when no one wants it. 

For example marijuana was put on my radar during that first big explosion but I just waited until no one cared about it anymore to start buying leaps and shares in those ETFs, which I‚Äôm up big on now and can hold for a long time 

So yeah being aggressive to me just means targeting investments in innovations that will be disruptive to the current markets. it doesn‚Äôt mean chasing those things aggressively 

you could also just find a more growth>value minded fund like ARK and let those fund managers sort it out. 

All in all, protecting capital is the king principle, but there is a strong case to have *some* allocation to growth minded strats as well"

2021-04-11 20:52:41,stocks,"You actually shouldn't be investing in high risk stuff.

You should be taking risks, that is true, but they should be good risks.   A member over on r/Bogleheads said it better than me in [a very well written post you should read.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/m7cwnl/young_people_should_take_risks_with_their/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

The summary is this:   It's fine when you're young to do stuff like only invest in good quality index funds, since if the market has a downturn, it will recover before you retire, instead of taking the 'safe' approach of not investing in the market.  By investing in a broad market index fund like VT, or a combination of VTI+VXUS you've bought a fund which will track the performance of the stock market, and although carries risk, it tends to be good risk, in that it is rewarded with long-term growth.

It also sounds like you're most likely really a 'Boglehead', you just don't know it yet.   Bogleheads follow the advice originally put to paper by John Bogle who founded Vanguard and who also came up with the idea of the index fund.   You might want to read the [Boglehead Getting Started Wiki page.](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started)  The strategies described on this page and in the sub I mentioned above should be right up your alley."

First I‚Äôm assuming you mean meme stocks. The situation is much more complex than children and dumb money gambling away their hard earned cash.

For once, GameStop is a value play that‚Äôs extremely safe compared to the market. The video game industry is $200 billion worldwide, where GameStop is the only international e-commerce company that specializes in gaming products, with $8 billion in annual income. That‚Äôs 4% of the market share.

We are also seeing an 11% increase in revenue since Ryan Cohen hired his upper management candidates in February.

GameStop is reducing cost by closing their unprofitable stores, introduce computer gaming products, and has grown 170% in e-commerce since last year.

Considering how overvalued the stock market is, not to mention the risk of inflation, GameStop is prob the safest bet right now, considering it should be valued at $500 if it was considered an e-commerce company like chewy, as they are trading at a 5x evaluation times earnings.

If they make $8 billion * 5 = $40 billion / 75 million shares = $533 per share"

2021-04-11 21:46:49,stocks,"So let me point you toward the following resources:

r/stocks (this sub) generally is oriented toward the group of people who like to buy individual stocks.  It's good for finding out about individual companies and the occasional ETF or fund.   Because you're only investing in a single stock or two, you're largely gambling that that stock will go up, which sounds like you've already experienced the drawbacks of that approach.   Some people make good money doing this, but it takes a lot of work and a little luck.   I compared it the other day to playing poker, and it's pretty much that - a good player can do well, but most people suck at it.

r/etfs is more oriented toward discussing ETFs.  ETFs are bundles of stocks that are selected in some way.     My problem with most ETFs is that they're little more than gambling on a bunch of stocks at the same time - like picking red or black on a roulette wheel.   Many ETFs only have 50 or so stocks in them.   Others pick a single industry, so if that industry does well, the ETF does well.  Or if it doesn't, the ETF goes down in value.   

There are some good ETFs out there...  The ETF's I mentioned (VTI and VXUS) are ETFs that hold most of the stocks in the US and international stock markets.  Together, these hold over 10,000 stocks. All 10,000 would have to tank at the same time for them to lose any large amount.    This has happened in the past, most recently in 2000, and 2008 and 2020, but in each case, the market has recovered to a higher value within a couple/few years.   That's why I said this was good risk and ok when you were young.

r/Bogleheads is a community based around Bogle's philosophy that says that investing in a long-term index fund will outperform pretty much all other strategies for most investors.   Or put differently:  most of us can't outperform the market, so instead, the strategy should be to match the market's performance.   Fortunately, this is rather easy to do - one only needs to buy a broad market index fund like VTI.

One final resource:

Over on r/personalfinance there is a [wiki page about how to handle money.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics)  This covers many things that I really wish I would have known and taken to heart at your age.   For example, I wish I had realized the importance of maintaining an emergency fund and not utilizing debt except for purchasing a house.   I know you're probably young enough that you do not have to deal with many things covered in this document, but it's also a lot easier not to make a mess that you have to clean up later."

Legally speaking I don't think there's any way that robinhood or webull or whatever could actually take shares from you without compensation. So, you could still set up an auto purchase for whatever you wanted and then after a year or few years do a brokerage transfer. OF course there is a fee for that so I would imagine it depends on how much you're talking about investing to make it worth it or not"

This dying company has also just been refitted with an entirely new Board of Directors. Notably of course Ryan Cohen as the Chairman. His customer service values and total success with the 40B Chewy e-commerce food store is evidence that their plans for the company are in the same ballpark. 

EOY this store will seem like a very promising play, and of course all the squeeze hype around it has given the store a cult following."

An agreement could be announced as soon as this week, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Talks are ongoing and the discussions could still fall apart.

2021-04-12 18:31:59,stocks,nuance has under 20$ forever other than last year's spike. If MSFT is paying in stock then they think their stock is overvalued and if they are paying in cash then MSFT management is stupid.

2021-04-11 20:54:41,stocks,MSFT is a good buy. I'm only going to worry about Microsoft once another spreadsheet overtakes Excel as the standard.
2021-04-11 23:58:30,stocks,I think msft is always a good buy. I feel a lot better owning them rather than Apple or Amazon at the moment.

2021-04-12 01:48:19,stocks,"Because it‚Äôs not. What sector does Microsoft have a monopoly in. The closest was Windows back in the day. Microsoft is so big these days because they are good at a lot of things. But don‚Äôt really have Monopoly in any sector.

2021-04-11 20:08:45,stocks,Me too. Especially considering Dragon Naturally Speaking is far superior to Microsoft's speech recognition.  This sucks.

2021-04-11 20:31:26,stocks,"Quality of speech recognition is comparatively poor. My workflow with Nuance is probably twice as slow as with Fluency. I have to speak much more purposefully and slowly (i.e., unnaturally) with Nuance despite putting in literally hundreds of autocorrect options and word re-training. With Fluency I can speak with a much more normal tone and speed, and the error rate is significantly less so I can spend much less time proof-reading. I'm a native English speaker, BTW."
2021-04-12 03:26:26,stocks,Nice try Satya!
2021-04-12 00:28:02,stocks,OP mentioned in another comment that it is from 3M.

2021-04-12 10:09:52,stocks,"Not just recent history, pretty much its entire history. Buy on any weakness, imo"
2021-04-11 22:07:10,stocks,Yup.  I buy Microsoft pretty much every month and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
2021-04-12 05:44:35,stocks,"Stock was pretty stagnant 2001-2013, so early part of that maybe. Investing in 1999-2001 would have lead to a long wait for profits."
2021-04-11 21:12:24,stocks,"That's pretty funny, I think the real red flags would be negative press around hololens in medicine or govt, or Azure outages starting to increase in frequency and duration."
2021-04-11 23:06:27,stocks,Haha I like this comment because my company has just transitioned to Google products and they suck in comparison.

2021-04-12 11:32:27,stocks,"Yeah this is most likely it, they‚Äôre also very cash rich at the moment and that‚Äôs not something growth investors like to see.

2021-04-12 07:43:22,stocks,"Yup. Europe here. Nuance was 38,00 at close on friday. Placed an order with a 42,00‚Ç¨ limit once I read the news yesterday. Stock was 48,00‚Ç¨ at open today which is roughly what Microsoft is supossedly going to offer if the deal goes through."
2021-04-11 22:26:39,stocks,I was talking about NUAN. I've been holding MSFT since 2000.
2021-04-12 04:31:04,stocks,Good.

Okay. So communism would be if there was just 1 major company.
Free Enterprise would represent several companies. We currently just have 4 major companies who each are focus on different sectors of our lives, and outside of cloud based technology they do not really compete with each other. I feel this would be more of a communist situation, would it not?

I have been involved in the tech industry my entire life.

Every single time that I see a new tech company getting big - rather than them get to a position where they could compete with the big 4 in some sectors. They get taken over by one of the big 4 companies. 
Oculus would be a great example of that."
2021-04-11 20:52:14,stocks,I use Dragon as well at work. Works very well overall. Never heard of Fluency.

2021-04-11 22:58:27,stocks,"Yeah, reducing that patent portfolio beta!"
2021-04-12 02:17:38,stocks,I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs more for their advances in the healthcare sector. Nuance has a good portion of the market share when it comes to voice dictation in healthcare.
2021-04-11 21:47:55,stocks,Do you think Nuance speech tech is better or worse than AWS speech recognition products like Lex/Alexa?
2021-04-11 21:29:30,stocks,Maybe a patent play
2021-04-11 22:19:49,stocks,Maybe the rumor is to run up Nuance and dump it?
2021-04-12 01:41:38,stocks,Gods bless you. I used Nuance to avoid a real job for about 6 or 7 years by writing erotica and product reviews.

2021-04-12 00:00:00,stocks,"Trading with a margin account but without borrowing and my OWN CASH. Hi Everyone,  


I've been trying to research this and find out but i recently moved to tradestation and i used to be on trading212. In the UK, there is a no settlement law for cash accounts as far as i know. There may be but trading212 didn't have this so therefore i could instantly sell and buy a stock within minutes apart and do this 20 or even 100 times a day, 5 days a week.

  
Because i have moved to US Broker, i have to wait for a settlement date until i can use my cash again which isn't ideal for a day trader. So my question is, can i open a margin account and never ever borrow their money so that way i can avoid any interest fee's and loan fees.  


Would this then allow me to instantly have access to my own cash again after i sell as long as i have 25k minimum at the end of each day? so lets say i purchase a stock and bought $30k worth and then i sell my investments and now i have $35k. On the same day, on a CASH ACCOUNT i would need to wait for the $35k to settle before i can use it again (3 days). IF i have a margin account, can i do the same thing but have the $35k available instantly without having to borrow from my broker?  


TLDR: Can i use a margin account to day trade 100 of trades without paying any margin account fees/loans.  


In advance, thanks for reading and i appreciate it if you would have time to reply :)"
2021-04-11 20:42:35,stocks,This is exactly the way I manage my margin account. To your question the answer is yes. What I do is deposit money to my brokers account and I can make trades without waiting for my money to settle. It‚Äôs more convenient compared to a cash account where you new to wait until it settle which can take up to 72 hours. I never borrow money on Margin which is tempting to do. My account gives me 100% of what I deposit as margin . So if I deposit 1k I get 1k in margin . Don‚Äôt mess with margin if you don‚Äôt have the colateral for it.

2021-04-12 15:02:47,stocks,"You don't need to be a CPA to be understand how tax deductions work...

You don't get taxed on revenue, but on profit. Business travel is an expense. It still costs the business money even though you pay less in taxes because of it.

At 21% corp tax rate, the $1000 plane ticket costs the business $790 after they pay taxes."
2021-04-11 21:13:06,stocks,What does tax advantage do??
2021-04-11 22:59:27,stocks,"Tax evasion is illegal, tax deduction is not.  Whatever deductions can be found are a tax advantage because you don't have to pay taxes on it.  If your deductions are more than your taxes owed, this would be an advantage.

Simple Example(NOT REAL WORLD, CHECK YOUR LOCAL TAX LAWS):

Joe sells lemonade.  Joe made 100 dollars selling Lemonade.  The government charges Joe's Lemonade Stand a 25% tax rate.  This means that Joe's Lemonade stand gets to keep $75 of that $100.  Now let's say that the government asks Joe, ""How much did you spend in operating costs""  If Joe spends 20 bucks on lemons, 50 bucks on lumber to build his stand, 15 dollars for a cash register, 20 dollars for cups, 10 bucks for sugar, 3 dollars for a pitcher and spoon, Joe can deduct these costs from his tax bill.

20+50+15+20+10+3= $118 of deductible costs that Joe can deduct from the taxes he owes.  Hey look Joe only owes $25 and deducting $118.  This is a very simplified version of tax advantage.

Asset depreciation, which is the decreased value of an asset over time, can also net millions for companies in tax breaks from the government.

Joe has a lot of cash at the end of a good year.  Joe buys a really nice boat and calls it Joe's Slicer.  Most people look at getting this boat as a bad idea but what most people don't know is Joe is deducting the boat from his business taxes.  The depreciation of the boat also gets tax breaks.  So Joe gets to use the boat for business(and maybe pleasure), he gets a tax break for owning it and since he spent all that cash, he won't get taxed on it.

I could multiply 100 x rev growth rate (I like avg over past 5 years) and see where it will be at in 5 year into the future (or 1, 3 or whatever) adjusted to its avg p/s of 40.

2021-04-12 06:12:39,stocks,">	How can us as retail investors replicate and/or protect ourselves from this?

The sort version:
You can‚Äôt fully replicate it on your own.
You can protect yourself by not buying stocks that are suddenly skyrocketing. Yeah, that‚Äôs not the answer people want to hear.

The only ‚Äúloophole‚Äù Archegos used was having trading accounts with multiple banks and buying securities of which they weren‚Äôt legally required to disclose the ownership.
The result is that no one exactly knew how big they were, and how much risk they had chosen to take.
Archegos did in fact take a lot of risk. Knowing this, some bank*may* (or may have not) refused to do so much business with them. They probably still would have, but a little less.

Archegos did not ‚Äúbring down‚Äù Viacom. Quite the opposite, Archegos fueled Viacom‚Äôs rally by buying a large stake of it. When it was forced to sell, the price went back.

That‚Äôs why you should be wary to buying a skyrocketing stock. Those movements are often caused by speculation and eventually reverse.

Archegos kept borrowing money to buy ever more Viacom etc. As Viacom‚Äôs price went up, Archegos account grew bigger, which allowed them to borrow more cash to buy more, and so on. It kept spreading itself very thin, with little margin for safety.

Then Viacom price dropped, because the company decided to take advantage of its skyrocketed valutation to raise money by issuing more shares, which didn‚Äôt find many buyers because, because its price was too high and the main buyer at rhe time (Archegos) was overextended and out of cash to invest.

Banks then asked Archegos for more money to protect themselves against losses in case of a further fall in value of the stock.
That‚Äôs normal, because when you buy on margin the bank buys the stock and holds it in your place, while you give them a percentage of the stock value (plus interest and fees) as guarantee against losses if the stock goes down.
As long as the prices go up, everyone is happy and you get your profits (minus fees). But if the stock price drops, percentage wise, close enough to the percentage you gave as guarantee, the bank will ask for more money or sell the stock to protect itself from losses in case of further drops.

Since Archegos didn‚Äôt have the cash, the banks decided to sell the stock. And since Archegos owned so much, the huge sale caused its price to collapse.

In addition, some banks that were slower in selling (because they tried to reach an agreement with other banks to all sell more slowly to avoid depressing the price so much) got screwed by their colleagues who dumped as fast as possible, were left bagholding and nursing losses.
So you can thank in part Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs for the sudden collapse of Viacom, they were the faster sellers.

It bears repeating: Viacom price collapsed because Archegos was forced to sell so much of it.
This suggests that Archegos was also a big force in the previous upward momentum of the price so high, since it bought so much in the first place.

Now, it makes no difference in regard to what happened, but if we want to be precise Archegos didn‚Äôt outright buy the stock.
The banks sold contracts whose value followed the price of the stock. At the same time, the banks had to buy the stock themselves, to not having to pay out of their pocket in case the stock (and thus contracts) value increased.

>	Ultimately, I feel that there‚Äôs been a lack of investigative journalism getting into the weeds and explaining what happened from CNBC/Bloomberg/WallStreet Journal etc.

Not true. Since you read Bloomberg I recommend following Matt Levine‚Äôs column, he generally goes in these kinds of market mechanics and covered Archegos as well. Google it and you will find a more detailed description of what I just wrote."

There's just less risk to them 9as opposed to being given 4x the margin) because they can margin call you more easily to avoid a total mess than if, you blew up with 4x more margin, which could quickly evaporate even with a margin call to reduce risk of the banks losing it all"

2021-04-12 05:40:25,stocks,"that is far from meaningless, its's possibly one of the most important things you could look at if you want to think of the health of society.  normally the number oscillates between 5% and 8% quite reliably and since *2008* it has not stopped going up.  do you not see where this trend is going or how this is a problem?

history should tell you that civilisations without monogamy do not last.  they are violent when there's polygyny, and they are usually conquered or they collapse.

at what point do you think this becomes an issue?  50% of men under 30?  90%?  if a significant chunk of men dont have the balls to get laid then we're fucked as a society cos they wont have the balls (or drive) to do anything else either

if they're virgins going into their 30s i doubt it will change for most of them.  we then either get men starting to misbehave, or we get weak men wasting their time and energy checking out of society (which we already see) and indulging escape mechanisms and not contributing with their full potential.  it's clearly a disaster.

Patience is the key, if u really love that stock then you set it on watch list and wait maybe a month (don't take fake dip for entry) if you still like the stock after that length of time then look for that low entry.

As for the S&P most people determine that it's over valued simply by looking at the chart. If the chart is high then they assume its over valued and if the chart is low then its under valued. The best investment strategy has and always will be to buy in with all you have and then keep buying in each month regardless of the price."

Their growth potential is still very promising. The upside far outweighs the downside in my opinion:

* Always possibility for another acquisition. They labeled their rebranding last month as a double down on innovation and growth so it's more likely than not since their innovation model stems from acquisitions.
* They're still organically growing at a rapid pace. Commenter below did mention it's difficult to grow new business in the EMR industry but MTBCs CAC is above industry standard for SaaS in general. Gaining $2 of revenue for every $1 invested
* We should start seeing a sharp increase in EBITDA over the next few quarters as they reduce duplicative costs from their two acquisitions last year

Looks like there's a solid support line for MTBC at $7.50. The price could continue to drop to that point if there's no catalyst. If it exceeds it then I wouldn't buy until things cool off and my position would be shot. But I personally think it's only a matter of time before this stock moves upwards."

Referring back to MF-SAdvisor, I think using the service and not is the difference between people who are willing to go through the research and one who will rely on others to do it for them, so they won't have to (whether the reason may range from other job commitments to pure laziness) .  People on /r/stocks are typically people who undergo some amount of DD, so I think it makes sense more people will not appreciate the service."

2021-04-12 09:19:34,stocks,I'm not so certain of that. Both companies are doing a dose expansion ph 2/3 study for their existing  ph 1/2 study. It is not easy to tell which one is ahead right now. I've seen some pharma news articles that indicate Biogen is ahead but nothing official. It is weird that there isn't a pH 2/3 listed on clinicaltrials.gov so I am a bit skeptical that those articles are correct. On the other hand the AGTC ph 2/3 is not expecting 6 mo results until Q3 2022 per their most recent earnings release so that suggests that it definitely hasn't completed enrollment and possibly hasn't even started yet.

In what world was buying at 20k a good idea if it immediately dropped afterwards? Sure bitcoin might be 100k in 5 years, but it also might be 10k in a month. How do you know now at 60k is a good time to buy? You clearly don‚Äôt."
2021-04-12 11:45:54,stocks,"Your statement was factually incorrect, so just wanted to mention that. The fluctuations being extreme doesn't make it a bad investment, because the fluctuations go both ways. You can't just say it tanked 500%, conveniently ignoring that it then proceeded to go up 2000% from it's 3k low.

You're basically arguing against crypto as an investment. Which is fine, nobody is forcing you to invest in crypto. But others like it and believe in the tech, it's their risk to take. It's a high risk/high reward investment, simple as that."
2021-04-12 10:45:28,stocks,"Actually, crypto is the easy way to invest into crypto. You can buy fractions of any crypto currencies. If you have 20$ you can invest in crypto, but you can't invest in Coinbase."
2021-04-12 14:54:42,stocks,"You clearly don‚Äôt understand. When ppl said it will only go up, that was when bitcoin was 20k, aka ‚Äú2017-2018‚Äù like I stated in my original comment. When it went down to 3k, nobody was uttering those words. You‚Äôre just fully ignoring that i was specifically talking about 2017-2018 when everyone was saying ‚Äúbuy, buy, buy.‚Äù Tesla will probably go up 20-years out, are you saying that ppl that bought at the ATH at around $900 was a good investment? Even though it immediately dropped to $530 and is currently sitting at $700? What confirmation-bias nonsense. 

I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre making assumptions and spewing. I‚Äôve been invested in crypto for 5 years now. Just because I said ‚Äòbitcoin is not guaranteed to only go up‚Äô doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm anti-crypto. I was countering bad investment advice. Saying someone should buy at the all-time-high is not remotely good advice. You can pay 60k now and it might be worth 20k in a month. That is why you dollar-cost-average on dips if you believe in something and don‚Äôt just assume something will only go up. For all we know, bitcoin can tank to 1k and won‚Äôt recover for 20 years. All this confirmation bias that ‚Äòit will only go up‚Äô is exactly how millions of people got burned last time around 3-4 years ago except for the small percentage that diamond-handed. Please stop going around giving terrible investment advice. Buying crypto is a speculative gamble at this point, not sound investment advice."
