2021-07-03 19:44:36,wallstreetbets,not with shares. if he expanded the tabs on those tickers you could see his closed option positions
2021-07-03 19:47:17,wallstreetbets,It's nearly impossible to do that with shares
2021-07-03 19:09:09,wallstreetbets,"Watching YouTube, apparently."

I have a FDs problem"
2021-07-03 17:58:08,wallstreetbets,"I mean, if you average out the many 1,000+% gains and the countless -99.9% returns, you get a pretty similar average, likely in the 15-35% range"
2021-07-03 17:57:25,wallstreetbets,Range between 27-33% annualized return

My stock account is \~1000% from June 2020.

Mostly due to me purchasing calls on GME at $12 a share and selling at 220

(I only put 5% of my money in at the time and it ballooned to being 60% of my portfolio)"
2021-07-03 18:05:25,wallstreetbets,"119%

If you asked me a week ago it would be -50% ish"

2021-07-03 17:58:10,wallstreetbets,"I did +1300% last year thanks to Tesla, SPACs, and of course GME.

It was a great year...

Now, I have mostly been selling covered calls and using the premium for more risky options plays. NEGG was a winner on Fri :)

Also, this survey will be skewed by reporter bias. Either people will want to brag about gainz or tout their retardness...so you'll get mostly extremes"
2021-07-03 18:56:52,wallstreetbets,People who have strong/positive returns are far more likely to comment then those with negative ones

Edit : for the third time this year lol"
2021-07-03 18:01:02,wallstreetbets,"Interested to see the numbers, however, I would caution that the expectation of 8-10% is over a long period of 20+ years. Yearly it will fluctuate a lot. Recently we have had an incredible bull run with so much going up. SPY as an ETF for S&P 500 has gone up 39% in the last year."
2021-07-03 18:55:29,wallstreetbets,"My ytd is 170%. During the run up to legal MJ in Canada I was pulling 70%. 2019 was dead, I didn't have strategies other than lucking out on growth figured out and I did 20%. 

I've never stopped learning and I think the rate at which I attain knowledge is accelerating. Optimistic about the coming decade."
2021-07-03 19:05:16,wallstreetbets,"My daytrading, swing trading, and theta plays make a good return. I then lose a bit every so often playing weeklies."
2021-07-03 18:28:34,wallstreetbets,The average is one thing but yeah try take a look at the difference in variance between the two.. food stamps or lambo vs plus or minus 10%
2021-07-03 18:42:43,wallstreetbets,-66%.   I haven‚Äôt quit my day job.
2021-07-03 18:59:42,wallstreetbets,Hell if I took investing advice from wsb I‚Äôd be sitting in the soup line.
2021-07-03 18:30:58,wallstreetbets,"Currently up 35% thanks to yolo-ing into (and out of) CLNE early, was up more but got into CLF and CLNE again (wanted to support the attempt at a gamma squeeze) a bit high. Long term I expect them to bounce back & be up roughly 50-60% for 2021"
2021-07-03 18:37:14,wallstreetbets,~830%
2021-07-03 19:27:07,wallstreetbets,Haven't completed 1 full year yet (7 months to be exact) and I'm at 16%.

2021-07-03 18:48:17,wallstreetbets,10% in a whole year ? Srs think id rather kill myself or lose the whole stack than post such weak sauce returns
2021-07-03 18:04:14,wallstreetbets,"Currently my portfolio was geared more to dividends and long-term investments lately I've been pivoting more into options as I prefer them over the long-term investment route plus dividends are horrible, ( taxes ). 

My whole portfolio averages between 25% to 35%."
2021-07-03 18:13:44,wallstreetbets,"usually, do about 2 or 3x the SPY but that number is going up bc i got an account that's still small/newish but so far in the last 2 years it's doing about 8x SPY"

2021-07-03 18:57:47,wallstreetbets,"It depends on the investor on how much money they want to risk their money for a bigger return. As for me,  I don't put in $20k in an option. That's too risky and too stressful for me."
2021-07-03 19:07:27,wallstreetbets,#Cramer that you?

2021-07-03 18:17:53,wallstreetbets,"15-35% is really good

But I think the big losses are capped more than the FD gains"
2021-07-03 19:40:33,wallstreetbets,üëÜ ditto.  Some weeks Food Stamps...  Some weeks slightly used Fords
2021-07-03 18:05:21,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I thought about that. I‚Äôm not doing some official research, I‚Äôm just bored. That‚Äôs why I posted my mundane returns, but if I just get extremes, whatevs."

2021-07-03 18:37:49,wallstreetbets,I thought that approximate sign was a negative sign at first.
2021-07-03 18:36:46,wallstreetbets,I was kind of expecting mainly success stories. Only certain people will respond. Hopefully some more of our ape brothers that are at a loss will post so we may honor them.
2021-07-03 18:08:30,wallstreetbets,"Of course, how silly of me! How could I be so careless?"
2021-07-03 18:16:12,wallstreetbets,Positions / Plays?
2021-07-03 18:44:55,wallstreetbets,Indeed.
2021-07-03 18:51:01,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but think. There are only so many massive wins like that. For every 1,000+% win, there are a hundred major losses."
2021-07-03 19:37:21,wallstreetbets,This sub likely has astronomical returns in total because it‚Äôs a huge amount of leveraged capital.  The more interesting question is if or not this sub generates any alpha in aggregate.
2021-07-03 18:16:18,wallstreetbets,"I rounded up so it‚Äôs exaggerated, actual is 38.91% crazy eh. Thing is if you increase to last 5 years average is somewhere around 15% per year.

Edit to say: this means entire S&P 500 could have a 28% correction and average yearly return over last five years would still be 10%."
2021-07-03 18:38:19,wallstreetbets,üòÇüòÇ
2021-07-03 18:41:31,wallstreetbets,SPY calls monthlies and weeklies
2021-07-03 19:23:49,wallstreetbets,"True, there‚Äôs probably 100 total losses per each 1,000%+ gain. % gain chart would probably be a largely right-skewed distribution with the peak around -100%.

What I meant by ‚Äúcapped‚Äù was these losses are typically huge calls where the max loss is 100% and upside is infinite. I‚Äôm sure some degens short or write naked calls in which max loss is infinite, but the WSB culture is mainly buying calls whose payoffs are inherently one-sided (limited downside, unlimited up) hence my predicted graph shape

I‚Äôd like to see the aggregate dollar P/L though- that would be interesting"
2021-07-03 19:50:40,wallstreetbets,"Yeah‚Äî see my reply to OP above. A graph of each play‚Äôs returns probably is peaked around -100% with a heavy right skew. I also would love to see the aggregate *dollar* P/L, since YOLO sizes seem to vary a ton. Could probably do a % P/L dollar-weighted, but I personally can‚Äôt"
2021-07-03 18:25:55,wallstreetbets,That still screams major fking correction incoming to my ears ... I could be totally wrong tho.
2021-07-03 18:42:54,wallstreetbets,"Yes. I‚Äôm in that group of belief too, but I have no idea when it will happen so I just keep going with plans in place if a major crash or correction does happen. The ‚ÄúBuffett Indicator‚Äù makes sense to me, even if it arguably doesn‚Äôt give enough credit for globalisation, and that indicator is screaming over valued."

2021-07-03 18:00:45,wallstreetbets,"Eventually people would sell, let's say the price doubled tomorrow a ton of people would like to pull profit and that's when it starts coming back down now if no one sold the price would obviously rise it's just simple supply and demand at that point."
2021-07-03 18:41:10,wallstreetbets,"The thing I never got about this allegation is, why wouldn't another hedge fund just pile into the stock and squeeze the illegal *super*shorts the second they thought the opponent was overexposed? Are they all allegedly on the same team? Is there nobody with a pile of millions that would just buy the rest of the float and force even these alleged options positions that hide short interest to be unprofitable?

I mean shit, one fund squeezing another fund is in pedestrian media like *Billions*. It's not some far fetched idea nobody has heard of. Are we assuming they don't see this opportunity, if it really exists? Are we really assuming no hedge fund wants to destroy another hedge fund and get rich in the process? That the guys who make sophisticated models about how the weather effects things can't see that there's an opportunity to buy and squeeze the money out of their rival?

Seems unlikely to me."
2021-07-03 18:13:03,wallstreetbets,Im still pissed they did us so dirty on GME lol
2021-07-03 18:07:18,wallstreetbets,"It would require coordination because people would be tempted to take profits.  During the GME squeeze it was still possible to borrow (not even buy) GME.  

For an example of long side taking full control look up Falcone and the MAAX bonds squeeze.  SEC decided that was market manipulation.   

Also the level of collaboration required would likely view the SEC as viewing the buyers as a group needing to disclose ownership of a significant stake in the company.  I believe there are rules that would be triggered as this group then effectively takes the company private."
2021-07-03 18:15:58,wallstreetbets,"Yeah everyone's way too motivated by greed for that to ever happen.

If I buy this overvalued stock, I'm expecting I can sell it to someone else at a higher price. At some point you take the profit and eliminate the risk.

It would just never happen for everyone to coordinate something like this."
2021-07-03 19:34:52,wallstreetbets,Your operating under false pretenses. No matter what you read here. Apes do not own all the stock of any company. And never will. Diamond hands do not exist. Everyone has a sell point way way lower than numbers your talking about. And if the market couldn't handle this itself. Wich it can. But in a worst case scenario.  The stock market is the economy for all intents and purposes. Unprecedented new actions would be taken to halt it. The US government is not going to let a meme stock take down Wallstreet.
2021-07-03 19:36:35,wallstreetbets,Lotta paper hands chasing that üí∏
2021-07-03 19:41:47,wallstreetbets,Here's what your missing. The squeeze happened exactly because of this. Retail are just pawns in a game.
2021-07-03 18:37:09,wallstreetbets,"Ya, That wasn't fair for anyone, we are not working together but we like to HOLD!! haha"
2021-07-03 19:28:11,wallstreetbets,"Buy into strength. Psfe has dogshit strength, even after the wsb p&d. I‚Äôd rather buy once the rocket starts moving.  I bought into wish after it was up 20% at 5x volume. I‚Äôd do the same here"
2021-07-03 19:38:35,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, hence the warning in TL;DR. Again, this is not a WSB post saying BUY HERE; it‚Äôs saying, we‚Äôre primed for a spring and watch for it. Then consider buying into the strength of a markup where it shows up."

I hope you all enjoyed this long weekend goof. 

WSB mods and the approved WSB users had a blast reading through the wild theories people were posting and talking about it in the daily thread. [Click here for more info how to become an approved user.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/approved-users-and-yacht-club)

As we enter the second half of 2021, let this be a reminder to always read everything with a skeptical mind and to seek out as many different viewpoints as possible before jumping to conclusions. Be especially careful of confirmation bias and echo chambers.

Trading is not a team sport. A healthy dose of skepticism on the veracity of and motivation behind people's posts and actions will take you a long way.

2021-07-03 16:03:44,wallstreetbets,"TL;DR: Why do this? Two reasons: 

1. Build a sense of community and continue long standing tradition 

2. To encourage people to think critically.

---

As mentioned in the stickied comment:

> As we enter the second half of 2021, let this be a reminder to always to read everything with a skeptical mind and to seek out as many different viewpoints as possible before jumping to conclusions. Be especially careful of confirmation bias and echo chambers.

I mean, why would BofA take legal action against WSB? That makes no sense. There was really nothing to corroborate the story except what one person wrote.

Many people on other social media platforms such as Twitter were pointing out the joke. Despite this, a lot of people glossed over the joke to push their own narrative, maybe because it confirms their biases or worldview.

---

If you got caught by this joke, take a second to think about how you come to decide who and what you believe, what their motivations are, and what they have to gain from you believing them.

For us? 

We love pulling these jokes, it builds a sense of community of people who get it, and those who don't. WSB has been pulling these kinds of practical jokes for almost a decade.

Now that you know, you're on ""the inside"" and the next time we make a joke like this, we hope you'll laugh quietly to yourself as you see people work themselves silly over what you know what is a joke."

2021-07-03 15:36:20,wallstreetbets,I don't. Some other subreddits have a serious no brigading rule so wsb mods decide to come up with some ridiculous news about lawsuits and then briefly set the sub to private. The fake news trickles into other subs to stir shit up and get people banned for mentioning wsb. Pathetic

No one signed up for lecture or life lessons this prank will cause far more problems for them than anything they solved and it looks bad for a sub with 10 million to have reckless mods. Do you see any sub with 10M doing stupid shit like this? No because people need to adult at times."

Yet you're acting like a BOFA deez nuts joke where the sub went private for 2 hours is an absolute travesty.

The WSB before the meme mania (prior to Jan) was brilliant. Truly brilliant yolos and DDs and just a completely different feeling community. Now it's full of Facebook/YouTube level comments 'insert ticker of the week + üöÄ' spammed from the same accounts 24/7 and wayyy lower quality DD. Everyone I know from it (whom I'm still in regular contact with our own small discords) have left here and say the same thing. It's hard to explain if you are only new to the place BUTTT if you are enjoying it then that's all that matters really

Yeah I'm a big fan of the memes made quarter of a mill off 7k usd would ya believe üòÇüòÇ but yeah they were they brought in a huge new crowd 900k->10mil in the space of a few months, complete change in mods etc!

He proceeded to start kissing my lips, but I screamed, no, in a desperate, loud voice. This caused Agent Peters to handcuff me to a chair. He then approached me and proceeded to strip down to his underwear. When he did this he exposed his large black erection to me. At this moment, I knew they could not just call this in, I was getting help after all.

Agent Peters said ""look around"" and I did, I found nothing to take out of the office. He then proceeded to show me another video in my head, of another agency agent I knew when I was a teenager, a coworker in high school. He told me about what they had done to him when he was a teenager and how this agent forced him to look through hundreds of images of barely dressed gay men on a laptop while he verbally tortured him with hate speech against his sexual orientation. He told me this happened to him when he was in high school.

At this point, I knew that they had no intention of letting me go, or letting me talk to my lawyer. I started yelling ""I know you guys think you're powerful and rich, but you don't know what you are doing"" in a desperate voice, thinking to myself, this was my moment, I must not let them get away with this, I must try to get out of this.

Agent Peters then approached me and I screamed, as much as I could and he knocked me out with a baton, hitting my right side of the head.

When I woke up, I was still handcuffed and laying in the same place. They left me alone for what seemed like hours.

I had long ago learned about the incident when the guy was a teenager and the agent telling me, so I could decide how much they could say about my involvement.

I also was informed that I wasn't the only one they had manipulated. I was later told of another agent at the same agency, who also was given a hard time when he turned out to be a closeted gay man. The agent told me they threatened to send him to a cult if he did not do what they wanted, his parent died when he was 10, he was young, and needed attention from adults. The agent also told me the fear they could use on him was his own fear for the consequences of being gay, after they had him sexually assaulted.

This incident forced me to change the way I work, I would always be armed, and sleep on the first floor of my apartment, using the bathroom on the second floor. They told me to wear condoms when I went out, also I would always check the closet in my apartment before going to sleep."

I hope you all enjoyed this long weekend goof. 

WSB mods and the approved WSB users had a blast reading through the wild theories people were posting and talking about it in the daily thread. [Click here for more info how to become an approved user.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/approved-users-and-yacht-club)

As we enter the second half of 2021, let this be a reminder to always to read everything with a skeptical mind and to seek out as many different viewpoints as possible before jumping to conclusions. Be especially careful of confirmation bias and echo chambers.

Trading is not a team sport. A healthy dose of skepticism on the veracity of and motivation behind people's posts and actions will take you a long way.

2021-07-03 17:56:26,wallstreetbets,"Mostly,  I day trade it. I watch it for a while to make sure it's bullish. Friday, for example.  It spent about 2 hours doing a horizontal 50 cent range of 431.40 ish to 431.90 ish. The support was rising, but not resistance.  At that point, I am interested at the next strike up. 432. But I want to see it go over that a few times while support rises. Then I wait for it to dip back down and buy a 432 strike while it's in the 431's. At least a week out for expiry. Delta was around .64 once it was in the money. I'm looking for half of that. So,  at least .32 cents profit. Once it passes that, if it continues up, I'll literally force myself to exit at .50 cents if it makes it that high. Staying in too long has bit me in the ass. If not,  I exit at my original .32 if it starts to go back down. Of course,  volume,  news,  etc. also play a factor. I also like to get some cheap, way out of the money calls to hold over. Kind of a lottery play."

2021-07-03 18:24:58,wallstreetbets,"Leaps are awesome I mostly do it for a company I would buy 100 shares so even if I end up owning the company I won't mind it.

2,6 week calls on spy are a touch more risk but it's helpful if you're not able to watch spy all day.

And mostly get a few points out of the money with a Delta right around 0.4 and I sell after about 2 _4 weeks into the contract with a 1 week sell no matter what just so I don't end up holding it on that last week."

Brunswick makes fucking yachts, and yacht engine parts and accessories. Those yacht parties your planning will be playing right into their hands. Earnings have been steadily increasing, and are due end of July, I expect a blow out quarter, why you ask?

Most of the naked short positions were instituted by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse. 6 weeks ago Discovery's short position was 58 million. The CEO of Discovery sold the great American country network for an undisclosed sum of money which will increase their revenues on August 6th. Like clockwork Discovery stock always moves up in July because of shark week and the added impetus they have with the exclusive rights to the Olympics in Europe. Methodically Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are reducing their naked short positions of Discovery. The CEO of Discovery is making the right moves to increase revenue shareholder value with the merger of Warner Brothers. On August 6th Discovery incorporated will exceed not only their revenue  but their earnings per share. In my opinion the financial institutions will have to cover their naked short positions."

**NOTE:** **This is not a short term play.** **This is an investment and could taker months or even years (I know crazy, who waits that long for money?)** **If you‚Äôre looking for a way to become rich over night this isn‚Äôt it.** **Go buy some SPY FDs or something and call me when you end up behind Wendy‚Äôs.**

**Uranium, why should I care?**

Uranium is used for nuclear energy. Specifically, it is used by nuclear power plants to create electricity. Now I know what you‚Äôre thinking, what about all that radiation? Radiation leaking and contamination are actually not very common even though movies act like it is. Plants are designed with this in mind and ways to prevent it. When people think of nuclear they think of Chernobyl, just know that was a case where a plant had a meltdown but the plant itself was not built to safety standards. That‚Äôs why that example was so bad. Modern plants are not built like that and honestly it should have never been allowed to operate in the state it was in. The other major one being Fukushima in Japan. While people know radiation leaked, there have been no reported deaths or cases of radiation sickness from that accident. In fact, the radiation has been contained and kept in water for treatment. Japan is even planning to release the treated water into the ocean in the next 2 years. So outside of these two major cases, nuclear energy really hasn‚Äôt had that sci fi movie effect of melting people or turning ants into giant city destroying monsters.

Now that we got past the scary part let‚Äôs get into the benefits of nuclear energy. For one it is carbon neutral. A coal burning plant will release as much carbon in 1 hour as a nuclear plant will release in its entire lifetime of operation. Not only is it a green energy source but it is vastly more efficient than other forms of green energy. To get the energy of a single nuclear power plant you would need 430 wind turbines or 3 million solar panels and no that‚Äôs not a typo. Nuclear plants require 1 square mile of space while a wind farm needs 360 times more space and solar photovoltaic plant requires 75 times more space. It‚Äôs more efficient and takes up far less space than renewable energy sources. This has a large impact on pricing as well. When Japan shut down their plants in response to the Fukushima meltdown their electricity costs went from $.17/wk hour to $1/kw hour. That‚Äôs more than 5 times the cost. Similar price increases have been seen in Germany who also shut down many of their plants. In fact, Japan is now planning to reopen their nuclear facilities to deal with this electrical energy issue. Finally, unlike renewable energy sources nuclear plants can operate 24 hours a day 7 days a week, have low maintenance needs and only need to be refueled every 1.5 to 2 years.

**Nuclear energy and the future**

Nuclear energy is already a major source of electricity for many nations. The US gets 20% of its energy from nuclear plants and nuclear accounts for 50% of the carbon-free electricity produced. Know how states are trying to go carbon neutral and want people driving electric cars? Well if our cars go electric they‚Äôre going to need a lot more energy production to maintain that and nuclear is the clear winner. The US has already approved two new power plants being built in Georgia expected to be up and running in 2021-2022. There is also bipartisan support for increasing the US nuclear capacity to meet future energy needs. France had pledged to decommission half their nuclear reactors, but after seeing the energy issues of Japan and Germany they have decided not to do this anymore. Then there‚Äôs China. China is looking to go carbon neutral to clean up their air and nuclear is their answer. They currently have 17 new nuclear reactors under construction. In total, the world has 50 new nuclear reactors currently under construction including Russia, India and the United Arab Emirates to name a few. As the world turns to nuclear energy they‚Äôre going to need more uranium to keep these plants going.

**How do plants get uranium?**

As stated before, nuclear plants need uranium to run. This uranium has to be mined and processed before it can be used at a plant. In addition, plants are specific so once the uranium has been treated it is only able to be used at that one plant. From mining to processing it takes over a year for the uranium to be ready for a plant to use. This means they need to have at least 2 years of stored uranium on hand at any given time. Remember that Fukushima meltdown? Well when Japan shut down their plants they had a lot of uranium on hand, about 100 million pounds of unprocessed uranium. So, they sold it to the market. This added a lot of uranium at once (Japan in 2011 accounted for 10% of the worlds nuclear energy) driving the price down. Operating a uranium mine isn‚Äôt cheap. Take Cameco Corp (CCJ). They are the world‚Äôs largest uranium mining company. They also have one of the cheapest uranium mines to run. For them to be profitable, they need to get at least $30/pound of uranium. Take a look at this graph below showing the price of uranium/pound.

&#x200B;

Uranium today sells for just over $32/pound. That‚Äôs barely enough to be profitable for Cameco Corp, and they have one of the most efficient mines out there. For many mining companies, uranium mining needs to be closer to $40/pound to be profitable. The way uranium mining works is they sign contracts, usually 10 years long, with power companies at a set price. Take a look at the same graph but now showing the last 10 years.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lgb094sauz871.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=06ddb7ecb0fb9e97cb589119ac6a82a429b08023

What you‚Äôll notice is starting around 2016 the price of uranium dropped to a point where it wasn‚Äôt profitable for mines to operate. So many of them didn‚Äôt sign new contracts and stopped production. Not only is production halted but these mines can‚Äôt just be activated right away. It takes time. If a mine were to reopen today, it would take 18-24 months for their uranium to be ready to be used at a plant.

There is a second way for plants to get their uranium. This is through the secondary market. These private groups have uranium they have bought up and are reselling to plants for their uranium needs. Many mining companies will also buy this uranium to make up for deficits in production for their contracts. However, this supply of secondary uranium appears to be running out. Take Denison Mines (DNN). They went to try and buy uranium on the secondary market and in order to fill their order they had to use 17 different suppliers. Within this secondary market is also that 100 million pounds that Japan sold off when they shut down their facilities in 2011. However, experts expect the Japan supply will be fully used up by the end of this year. It is unclear how much uranium is left in the secondary market, but experts predict between 2-3 years of uranium are left.

**Uranium prices and the future**

So we have established two key things. Uranium prices are currently too low for most mines to operate and uranium stocks are starting to run out. So what does this mean? Well simply put, it‚Äôs supply and demand. As the supply drops the demand for uranium will go up. As it goes up the prices will also go up. Experts predict that Uranium will have to get to around $50-60/ pound before most mines will be willing to sign new contracts. That‚Äôs double the current price. Now remember, these are 10 year contracts. This is where the price increase for uranium will come from. Also remember, these companies are not running the majority of their mines or for some of them any of them. So they will go to full capacity and make double the current market amount per pound. These two things mean $$$ and stock go up! Now that $50-60 price is not set in stone, it could very well be higher as power companies bid against each other and the longer power companies let the supply drain the higher that price will be. In the power industry, many of them are in denial stating there is no current uranium shortage, but it is estimated the US only has 2-3 years of stored uranium left and US companies 1-2 years worth. These companies usually never let their supply drop below 2 years because it takes a reopened mine 18-24 months to get them that usable uranium. So the longer they wait the more they will have to pay as they start negotiating contracts against each other to fill their needs.

**The big uranium squeeze**

Yes I know I said the S word. Don‚Äôt start jumping around thinking you‚Äôre about to buy all the uranium stocks and cause them to rocket. That‚Äôs not what it means. Remember those secondary markets I talked about before? Many are private buyers and in particular hedge funds. Yes those hedge funds. But no don‚Äôt start booing, in this case they‚Äôre our friends. Now put the torches down and let me explain. When hedge funds start getting the feeling uranium supply is dropping they start buying up uranium. And they buy a lot of it. They try to take over the secondary market supply. Why? Because then when the power companies come to them to buy uranium they jack the prices up and squeeze them. Yes, the hedge funds cause a squeeze and this squeeze can cause uranium prices to soar. Take a look at that chart again.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o0puqojbuz871.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=adfd25c193b21f50f64b4725ff5f5c6460eed6a3

See that giant surge in 2007? Yep, that was a uranium squeeze caused by hedge funds. And when the price of the secondary market soars those mining contracts soar to match it. Many mining companies in 2007 signed big fat contracts of $100/pound of uranium. This is the gold mine, where we go from making some money to having to decide which color Porsche we will be buying. Now, this is not a guarantee and most experts actually think it won‚Äôt happen as most power companies remember 2007 very well and don‚Äôt want that again. But, those same power companies are also in denial about the uranium supply and hedge funds have already started putting a low of money into uranium. But even if this doesn‚Äôt happen, the stocks will still go up when uranium hits that $50-60/pound price range. This would just be icing on the cake.

**The Bear Case**

Yes, yes I know, we hate bears. But I have to include it. There are three major bear cases against nuclear.

The first, and probably most obvious is the threat of another major meltdown. If this were to happen the world could turn from nuclear and seek different energy sources. Public opinion does play into the creation of new nuclear plants and we saw how 2011‚Äôs Fukushima meltdown caused Japan and Germany to turn from nuclear to new energy sources.

Second, there is a chance there are uranium sources out there that are not accounted for. Unknown suppliers could come out and show that uranium stocks are in fact not low. While this would cause an issue in the short term, it still wouldn‚Äôt fix the fact that eventually they would still run out. It‚Äôs not like people can just come up with unlimited uranium without mining it.

The last one is if China decides to change their plans. While not likely, they could announce tomorrow they‚Äôre changing from nuclear to a different energy source. This would cause issues as it would remove a major nuclear nation. But again, it‚Äôs not likely with 17 facilities already under construction.

**Conclusion**

There you have it, the uranium stock piles are going down, not enough is being mined to maintain them and at some point the price is going to go up and when it does you‚Äôre going to want to own shares in uranium. As I said this is a long play and you should be prepared to have your money sit for 2-3 years, maybe even more. But the stage is set and at some point Uranium is going to go up. Just make sure you‚Äôre in before prices get out of reach.

**TLDR:** Uranium supply is dropping and mining is limited because the price is low. Low supply will cause a higher demand and we know supply plus demand = money!

**Final Note:** I didn‚Äôt mention any company suggestions because I felt this DD was already long enough. If people want I can make a follow-up where I list out the companies and some pros and cons.

2021-07-03 16:44:09,wallstreetbets,Been holding 100 shares of URA and selling CCs for a while now. The premiums are trash but it's honest work and I too am bullish on nuclear energy.
2021-07-03 16:33:28,wallstreetbets,Disagree with OP mostly.  OECD puts out a report every two years and according to their latest [report](https://www.oecd-nea.org/upload/docs/application/pdf/2020-12/7555_uranium_-_resources_production_and_demand_2020__web.pdf) not only is there enough uranium for current usage but enough for significant growth in nuclear capacity.  It also states that plants have increased their stock due to depressed prices.   While some of the extraction and production have been curtailed this capacity can come online quite quickly should favourable market conditions arise.  I‚Äôm not going to paraphrase all 483 pages but if you want more information the first 16 pages should do.  The conditions OP is talking about are possible but on the extreme high end of estimates.
2021-07-03 12:30:23,wallstreetbets,"Not a bad DD but I don't think I agree with the conclusion. Yes nuclear fission power plants will have to become a thing in the future but I don't think uranium will be used.

The world hates nuclear power because oOo MaH mElTdOwN. For nuclear power to become a thing again governments, activist, and companies involved have to convince the world that nuc power is safe. And that is not happening with uranium based reactors with designs from the 60s. Newer designs are focused on alternatives such as thorium. So I am not quite convinced.

None of the uranium miners have the ability to enrich the uranium they mine.  So, their huge stockpiles are essentially useless.

2021-07-03 12:52:09,wallstreetbets,Thorium hasn‚Äôt been executed on yet. I was a big believer and went into thorium stocks in 2010. We are still at least 2 decades away from thorium gaining any traction. The world has a solid history of executing and implementing uranium plants. And we have well over 100 years left of uranium to burn.
2021-07-03 17:07:45,wallstreetbets,Yes. Google uranium ETF there‚Äôs a few.
2021-07-03 19:45:25,wallstreetbets,I truly don‚Äôt expect a uranium squeeze. Many people in charge of the power plants were also in charge in 2007 and they‚Äôre not going to let that happen again. But at its current price uranium mining isn‚Äôt profitable for many mines. Add to this the mines that are mining aren‚Äôt mining enough to meet yearly supplies and at some point these companies are going to have to start negotiating contracts at higher uranium prices. Maybe now $100 high but $50-60 seams realistic which is still a good increase.
2021-07-03 10:38:19,wallstreetbets,"So your theory is supply is indeed down, prices are indeed too low for most mines to mine but we have unlimited uranium just not stored anywhere?  The supply being down, which you acknowledge, combines with the low price of uranium still supports what I was saying.  Price per pound needs to increase."
2021-07-03 18:33:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. My degree is in mechanical engineering so I try to trade in sectors I know about. So a lot of energy and tech. While long long term I feel bullish on nuclear, it‚Äôs going to take ALOT of changing to get us there. It‚Äôs still possible it could take off. Especially with the issues we face right now with just not having enough actual power output to meet demand. Maybe. Just maybe. But at the same time I‚Äôm very skeptical."
2021-07-03 16:40:00,wallstreetbets,No not a bear or a bull but the curtailed capacity amounts to about 28k tones/yr or 50% of global capacity.
2021-07-03 12:11:51,wallstreetbets,"No ü§°. Supply is always down. Supply is always down Bc there is no shortage as in we can always mine more. Mining uranium is not worth it as the margins a low and that‚Äôs is not profitable. 

So again. ü§° storage is the issue with uranium and not supply. Think of it as just in time mining. The supply isn‚Äôt down as it‚Äôs available.  Miners do this to lower overhead and produce as needed. The premiums for ‚Äúomg I need uranium right now‚Äù don‚Äôt exist. This COMMODITY only goes up and down through futures and contract cycles.

Only approved users can participate here. They can induct and eject other users which will be displayed publicly as it is happening in the above tables. Anyone on the approved users list (which you cannot see) will be ignored entirely by /u/VisualMod and most of the AutoModerator rules for all comments and submissions, so bestow this status on people wisely to accrue traders and bros to the thread.
Five affirmative votes are required to induct or eject someone. Simply click one of the links below and put their username (no /u/) in the body of the message.

If we were able to find an efficient method of lunar regolith mining, there would no longer be the fear of nuclear meltdowns, as He3 is a stable isotope (that releases protons rather than neutrons in D-He3 fusion, which can be easily contained), meaning, there is virtually no radioactive waste and the reaction products can be used for direct energy conversion."

I really didn't want them to go full cult. I really didn't. But the mods there are determined to make it their own thing for their own gain. It's really sad.

I personally think reddit is probably gonna intervene eventually and shut the whole thing down. The stuff they're spreading is 50% of the time demonstrably false... 40% of the time a Facebook-tier meme from 2007 and 5% actually insightful interesting information about the American Financial Institutions and Makets ... and 5% about Gamestop.

I think they can do wonders for future logistics. I think leading logistics company right now is xpo at 145$ a share. But workhorse is logistics future.  
 Blackberry has some cool new contracts I think? You might see another push on it, but I'm not nearly as confident in that one coming back."

2021-07-03 11:08:54,wallstreetbets,Trick to a successful YOLO is to make about a hundred different YOLOs and then maybe 1 will win making up for the 99 losses.  Otherwise you'd have better odds at the race track.

Next thing you know you've seen about 10 to 15 posts on it and it's been days if not weeks. Buy the stock because it's generating a lot of interest from people. Immediately drops 10% or more.

2021-07-03 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Facebook and Blackberry may be negotiating a 2 billion patent sale and a partnership . WhatsApp Messenger - Blackberry Secure/ SecuSmart enabled for Enterprise. Blackberry filed a lawsuit against Facebook for Patent Infringement. Technology in WhatsApp Messenger appearntly is Blackberry's tech and Facebook wasn't paying any licensing fees to Blackberry. Both parties settled out of count , Blackberry got a judgement against Facebook and a judge in Germany ordered a hault on WhatsApp use of BB technology which could have affected nearly 80 million users. 

Only the patent settlement Facebook and Blackberry reached out of court recently turned into a patent sale. With a large upfront payment and 7 years of IP licensing tail. 

John Chen CEO said in March that BB entered into patent sale negotiation with North America based tech co and can't disclose more. 

I strongly believe that BB and FB are negotiating not just patent sale but also a partnership agreement. Blackberry will secure WhatsApp Messenger for Enterprise. Blackberry gets free advertising on FB Instagram. 

Patent payout upfront 600 million plus 1.4 billion over seven years in IP licensing. 

Facebook wants to get in on the action and partner with Blackberry. After all it's Blackberry who invented the smart phone and the instant messenger. Judges, lawyers and political figures were using Secure Messenger BBM well before anyone else. They were first to market in smart phones and BBM

Mark Zuckerberg was living in the college dorm even Blackberry enterprise customers were already using BBM and it's only fair that Blackberry finally gets fair compensation for their innovative technology. 

John Chen when asked about the patent sale he said stay tuned. He meant there is very good news coming soon. Don't sell your shares. Hold"

2021-07-03 04:39:39,wallstreetbets,"Blackberry beat estimates in Q1 FY 2022

"" BlackBerry posted a loss of 11 cents per share for the three months ended May 31, significantly lower than a loss of $1.14 per share in the year-ago quarter. Its adjusted loss also decreased to 5 cents per share, compared to a loss of 6 cents per share projection by analysts.


Revenue for the quarter slipped to $174 million, versus $206 million in the comparable period of 2020. Analysts, on average, were expecting BlackBerry to report revenue of $172 million. Cybersecurity revenue came in at $107 million, while IoT revenue stood at $43 million.

Speaking on the results, CEO John Chen said, ‚ÄúThis quarter we aligned the business around the two key market opportunities ‚Äì IoT and Cyber Security.  In IoT we are pleased with the strong progress of the auto business, despite global chip shortage headwinds.  Design activity remains strong, the number of vehicles with QNX software embedded has increased to 195 million, and royalty revenue backlog grew by 9% year-over-year.  Tangible progress continues to be made with BlackBerry IVY, including the launch of the IVY Advisory Council and the first investment by the IVY Innovation Fund.‚Äù

2021-07-03 19:00:58,wallstreetbets,"Same shit was said about AMD when it was about to launch its RYZEN product line. IVY to BB is what RYZEN was to AMD and look what happened to AMD‚Äôs stock price over 2 years. The downgrades are based on current financials. Of course they are shitting the bed in cash. They haven‚Äôt released one of their main products yet. Hold this ish for 2-4 years and you will 5-10x your money. 

Also whenever this patent deal goes through expect a movement up to 20 on the stock price again and possibly past that."
2021-07-03 11:53:47,wallstreetbets,FB probably has enough money in their couch cushions to outright buy BB

Is Blackberry IVY advisory council with GEICO Telus Here Cerence Amazon AWS doomed to fail. All those companies are wasting time partnering with Blackberry. Do you think they are not going to make it. Not have enough funding, software engineering team and the know how.

Don't listen to lying paid analyst. They want you to sell so they can pick up your shares. Allianz Asset Magement Black Rock JP Morgan Chase Primecap Vanguard Fairfax Financial all holding BB shares. Why aren't they selling and listening to the lying analyst."

Here is the 3rd catalyst that may or may not spook the markets, will see. Next week, the Fed releases the minutes from its last meeting where it revealed it was starting to talk about cutting back on its bond buying. If there are more details, it could move markets.

The Fed‚Äôs minutes from its last meeting will be released **Wednesday afternoon,** and there is potential for the market to learn more about the central bank‚Äôs behind-the-scenes discussions on winding down its quantitative easing program.

‚ÄúOur base case is that rates drift higher, but in order to that get that move higher [you need a catalyst to get there](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/fed-could-be-a-surprise-catalyst-for-markets-in-holiday-week-.html),‚Äù said Brian Daingerfield, head of G10 FX strategy Americas at NatWest Markets. ‚ÄúEither the Fed has to move forward aggressively on tapering, or you have to get the data really rocking, and you don‚Äôt have either.‚Äù

2021-07-03 00:32:14,wallstreetbets,"Simply explained, a put is a contract where someone says they will buy stock from you at a set price by a certain date in exchange for a fee. You get to force sell your stock to them if you exercise your contract. The trick is, the market price for the stock should be less than the price you agreed on in this contract - otherwise, you would make more money selling your stocks on the open market. So the person who you pay your fee to is betting that the stock will not fall that far down in price, while you are betting that it will. 

This is kind of the opposite of a call. In a call, you pay a fee to *buy* their shares at a price. You hope the price is lower than market price so you can buy from your contract guy (exercise your call) and turn around and sell them at the market price."

2021-07-03 11:39:13,wallstreetbets,Certified retard.
2021-07-03 01:30:37,wallstreetbets,"Pretty much. In a call, if you buy the contract (give someone a fee), you are betting the price of stock goes above and beyond the agreed upon price - the strike price. If that happens, you can buy stock via exercising the contract and then sell that stock on the open market for gains.

In a put, if you buy the contract (pay someone a fee), you are betting the price of stock goes down and under the agreed upon strike price. If that happens, you would buy stock at the open market price and turn around and sell it to the person you have a contract with for the $$$.

This doesn't have to be immediate steps, you could wait between buying stocks and selling them. E.g. for calls, you may think the stock would still increase in price so you'll hold longer. E.g. for puts, you may have already bought multiples of 100 shares and want to protect yourself in case of a big downturn in stock price, like before an earnings report."
2021-07-03 10:51:52,wallstreetbets,"OP is photoshopped. This explains the DUOL mismatch, and the $69 meme.

OP's example has no fee listed. But generally, when you look at options, you will see a fee per share. For example, $AMC traded at $51.92 per Fidelity. The option for July 9 for a $69 strikeprice would have a fee of $1.02 per share. All contracts are 100 shares, so, to purchase the right to buy 100 AMC shares at $69, you can pwy someone $102. But this contract would expire on July 9 - if AMC doesn't get that high, you made a losing bet. The $102 would be kept by the person you sold it to, regardless of what happens to AMC prices.

The trick is, like the stocks actual price, the fee for options at various strikes will fluctuate. You can set limit orders and hope a fee/share cost goes down, but then you need to think about volatility. The cost to do a lucrative options bet is going to be high or rise the more likely you are to win. So if it became cheaper to buy in on this bet, the odds are not in your favor. However, if you buy them at many months in the future, you definitely give time for the stock to go in the direction you want."

I personally feel that once you have more than 10-20 positions, you may was well sit in an index fund.  What has worked for me is keeping 5-10 positions that I watch like a hawk, having roughly 50 stocks I watch regularly, not being afraid to sell or get concentrated, not being afraid to get neutral when the markets or industries are pulling back,  and having deep knowledge in specific industries."

2021-07-03 10:13:44,wallstreetbets,This is what it‚Äôs like being on death row.  You know your date of execution and can only watch the clock til the executioner opens your cell.  Fair well friend. Any last words?
2021-07-03 04:33:41,wallstreetbets,"I never felt bad for those losing money on options. 

If you want the stock to go up, you buy shares and hold. But no, you scumbags think you are so smart, using the rest of us like stepping stones to profit, well karma is a bitch."

2021-07-03 10:07:39,wallstreetbets,Have you ever bought anything on Wish? Have your ever downloaded their app? It's an absolute trash company.
2021-07-02 23:01:57,wallstreetbets,Sell
2021-07-03 11:44:58,wallstreetbets,Doesn't matter. This was on track for a stable 15-16 and then the gamma scalpers came in and scared off the swing and value traders. Its going to be a month or more before the IV drops and this stablizes again.
2021-07-02 20:30:37,wallstreetbets,Hope you profit on your $21 calls üòÉ
2021-07-03 11:45:54,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations. You played yourself. You got lotto tickets that forced the stock higher from gamma pumping, and now theta will destroy you because you don't understand scalping versus swing/value buying."
2021-07-02 22:25:40,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain calls and contracts
2021-07-03 17:35:17,wallstreetbets,Ya and remember this jumped from 7 to 16 in one day
2021-07-03 05:19:52,wallstreetbets,"Basically gambling to buy options on WSB stock, sometimes it makes you 5000% returns most times it costs you all your money."

2021-07-03 17:54:33,wallstreetbets,"All my losses are from clov, amc, bb. No more meme"
2021-07-03 18:18:24,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs like gambling vs investing
2021-07-02 22:26:08,wallstreetbets,Explain the difference
2021-07-03 10:21:01,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs farewell, not fair well. $Wish -ing for a GED in your future."
2021-07-03 10:19:16,wallstreetbets,"I also never feel bad if I‚Äôm losing on options. See we have something in common now. Can we be friends now? WISHing for a friend, I‚Äôm super lonely üòî"
2021-07-03 11:51:35,wallstreetbets,"No fuckwit, its a combination of both shares and calls. The problem isn't they're not buying shares. Its that they're stacking their calls vertically across strikes on near term dates so that as soon as theta starts ticking its driving their premiums into the ground. Premium decays, delta decays, shares that hedged the calls get sold, and a death spiral begins entirely based on simple market mechanics. Regardless if they bought shares or not, the downward pressure of their short term calls expiring would kill them either way.

The way they fix this is buying short term ATM calls, as well as a mix of strikes further out. For example, 12 DTE WISH 12c, then August 14c, then October 16c or 20c. Then they back the calls with some shares. The market makers will provide the fuel to lever the stock up buying shares. The value investors hold the shares, and as the calls approach 1 delta, cash out a percentage to cover the cost of the calls and exercise the rest. The exercise moves the shares from the market makers to value investors, and then you pump the stock again with more call buying at new short term ATM options."
2021-07-03 01:01:10,wallstreetbets,But your wife told me last night to buy calls when you weren‚Äôt home.
2021-07-03 12:03:53,wallstreetbets,"Those Calls were all paid for , from some of my profits from dec $10 calls I got when the stock was $7.
ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. All good"
2021-07-02 23:57:30,wallstreetbets,"Contracts = options. Calls and Puts are types of options. Calls are bets for an increase, puts are for bets for a decrease."

2021-07-02 22:59:23,wallstreetbets,Is this a serious question?
2021-07-02 23:28:09,wallstreetbets,I suggest watching videos on YT to understand options. It's way too much to explain in a comment.

The company offers gamer and creator peripherals, including gaming keyboards, mice, headsets, and controllers, as well as capture cards, stream decks, USB microphones, studio accessories, and EpocCam software.

Corsair Gaming, Inc. was incorporated in 1994 and is headquartered in Fremont, California. Corsair Gaming, Inc. operates as a subsidiary of Corsair Group (Cayman), LP.

&#x200B;

The company IPO'd in Sep of 2020 so still new to the market and slightly undiscovered. Once discovered and potential realized, this should be trading over $100 long term. See below for more info:

**Income Statement:**

Revenue (ttm)**1.92B**

Revenue Per Share (ttm) **21.80**

Quarterly Revenue Growth (yoy) **71.60%**

Gross Profit **(ttm) 466.93M**

Net Income Avi to Common (ttm)**148.72M**

Price to earning is now trading 1.5 times, if we compare that to peers or SPY, they trade about 3-4 time PE ratio. Corsair is extremely undervalued growth gem and once discovered, should be at a fair value of about $70/per share now (being conservative).

&#x200B;

Chart is trading near bottom and is looking to reverse upward, recent jump to $43 two weeks ago, now trading around $32/share. MACD is about to cross back over and waiting on RSI confirmation.

2021-07-02 21:25:34,wallstreetbets,I'm in.... And down so far. I'll hold for a long time tho

2021-07-03 05:32:05,wallstreetbets,"ET is the only short term bear case unless they somehow miss earnings, which they never have. A few things to consider, about a month back they sold 3-4 million shares around 32 on a high volume day of 4.5 million, clearly an organised trade to someone. Yet on last weeks pump they only sold 5 million over 2 days at a much higher price on a combined volume of nearly 100 million. They obviously could have dumped much more if they wanted to quickly exit at a better price than they have sold for previously, yet they didn‚Äôt. I have a few theories on this (none of which we can confirm so take with salt ofc). They have pre set sells at certain price levels by certain dates, they don‚Äôt want to drop below 50% ownership for various obvious reasons, or they simply couldn‚Äôt dump more, the CEO stated at a conference a few months ago ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt worry about ET selling too much as they can only CONTRACTUALLY sell so many shares by certain dates‚Äù. I believe if we have another pump unless it goes much higher than last Monday we won‚Äôt see any more ET selling, at least in the short term.

2021-07-03 05:11:20,wallstreetbets,This is by definition false in the world of business valuation and ownership interests.  Majority ownership means the majority owner has sufficient control of the firm to make decisions with 0% support from other owners.

2021-07-03 02:07:42,wallstreetbets,"AMD's drivers and software support is trash for professional uses and machine learning. There is a reason why every single data scientist trains models on NVIDIA GPUs.

AMD has shown again and again to be uninterested in investing in ML, including still refusing to add ASIC-based ML acceleration to their GPUs (ala Tensor Cores), as well as refusing to create any sort of software like CUDA that is well-built, and consistently available across the entire range of NVIDIA's GPUs (running from a GT 710 to a RTX 3090 or Quadro, Teslas, etc)."
2021-07-02 22:45:10,wallstreetbets,You could just look at the inside bar break on the daily (June 10th). Also clear bull flag. Price action is king.

2021-07-03 09:43:30,wallstreetbets,And Fridays close with a hammer candlestick makes me feel better about my 7/9 830c
2021-07-03 15:42:45,wallstreetbets,"AMD already started it‚Äôs run man. But I agree, tons more upside."
2021-07-02 23:39:36,wallstreetbets,Google inside bar. It's where price action tightens up (consolidation) and you can usually expect an explosive move. It's one of the most reliable trading signals and works on any timeframe. AMC had 3x monthly inside bars and you know what happened once there was a breakout. I knew to enter calls above 12.22 or puts below 8.31 (April monthly candle range).
2021-07-02 20:54:44,wallstreetbets,GTFO you started 7 months ago with 20k and are looking at a possible half a mil?

Because the aggressive ones were gutted and fined out of existence by the state while the business unions that played ball were allowed to grow.  


Actual unions are democratic and empower the lowest workers to get engaged and advocate for themselves.  Don't confuse solidarity unionism and business unionism.  That's like saying an encyclopedia and Twilight are the same because they are both books."

People immediately assumed the worst and created conspiracies about how the hedgies had finally won, etc.

So we thought it was funny and waited a bit and dropped the ""deeze nuts"" punchline to ""bofa"" hoping it'd be a moment they'd remember about not running with the most malicious interpretation into the conspiracy rabbithole. No, it wasn't some plan, it just kinda turned out that way.

If the setup to a joke makes you immediately come up with a conspiracy theory that confirms your bias, you gotta reflect a little. That or people are just gonna keep dropping deeze nuts on you.

...but I see in another post he claims to have sold other shares so maybe he wasn't technically out of ""dry powder"" per his first post."

2021-07-03 11:34:05,wallstreetbets,"Huh? They don‚Äôt lose 33 or 50 percent of their positions, those percentages were mentioned in regards to what would/would not be locked up based on share price. How insane would that be if insiders literally just had their shares vanish? Read the docs again.

Longs are just holding. Shorts are using the lockup expiry to spur a sell off for the time being and profiting off it."
2021-07-02 22:47:05,wallstreetbets,None of this makes sense. 140% institutional ownership? Longs want price to drop? OK bud.
2021-07-03 08:40:27,wallstreetbets,No more dry powder could be just that everything is invested at the time. Since then he may have sold other positions. At least I did that.

2021-07-03 10:20:03,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs a cool idea actually. Here‚Äôs a peek into ‚Äúhow we mod YOLOs‚Äù‚Ä¶

Automod takes away a significant amount of spam YOLOs. zjz is super impressive with his skills and has it set up to prevent obvious fakes or small amounts from ever getting through. So those fakes you never see.

If it‚Äôs not 10k in options, 25k in shares, if it‚Äôs a repeat position or old position it‚Äôs removed and rarely verified at that point unless really sus. 

When you get to the qualifying territory a lot of trades I look at I can tell are more likely to be legit than not. We see options we do the math, check the daily volume, know that brokerage doesn‚Äôt have a paper trading account, we check the options contract or share prices in historical data, the guy has been recently verified‚Ä¶ things like that. I won‚Äôt verify those because it‚Äôs nearly 100% real and not worth taking the mod time away from other things, so we don‚Äôt ask for more verification in those cases. 

If I ask it means I‚Äôm already thinking it‚Äôs a strong possibility of being fake. Overly cropped, brokerage has a virtual/paper trading option, large invested amount, past profile history a little sus, maybe large back-to-back trades, etc‚Ä¶of those maybe 1 in 5 are fake on average. That 1 would be permanently banned.

So you‚Äôll be left with maybe 15 YOLOs or something on any given day and started with maybe 40+. Mostly non qualifying or a repost, occasionally a fake."
2021-07-03 00:36:54,wallstreetbets,The over 100% institutional ownership is true. It has to do with institutions buying up shorted shares.
2021-07-03 12:12:37,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I'd say no more dry powder meaning no liquidity at that point in time it doesnf mean ""already remortgaged the house"""

2021-07-03 11:41:28,wallstreetbets,Good stuff - thanks for detailed reply.. The last thing we want is fake posts being used by retards trying to pump up stocks.
2021-07-03 01:32:33,wallstreetbets,100% is from naked shorting. Clov would also have mich higher SI with that. On the books GME is at 20% and CLOV is at 53%
2021-07-03 02:35:21,wallstreetbets,It went from $5 to $300 what do you mean?  Is that not way up?
2021-07-03 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"This is why you do your own research & A Suggestion(s) For The Mods I've seen a lot of misinformation and, quite frankly, stupidity on this sub recently (okay, for a few months now). Usually, i just shake my head and sigh when the latest session of musical chairs on one ticker, or another, occurs after being pumped on here. The dump then occurs within 5 to 10 minutes of open, leaving a lot of bag holders. 

I've tried to stay out of these things, even though i could profit off it. The reason for this is two fold. First, I'd rather buy companies that I am actually okay with holding, because unlike most of you, i can be patient and therefore my investment horizon for a ""baghold"" is longer than a day, week, or month. The second reason is that I feel gross taking advantage of people who just dump their life savings without much due diligence into what they are investing in, in the hopes of getting rich quick (much too often resulting in them buying utter garbage). While it would be equivalent to taking candy from a baby, I'm not out to harm people for my own benefit. I grimace when i recall cases like the individual who was expecting his 4th child in two weeks, but who dumped his entire savings into a RKT earnings options play, and subsequently lost everything. I can understand gambling with your money, but i find it deeply disturbing when people gamble with their families money. 

With that said, somehow WSB ends up sweeping me along for the ride sometimes. First with the Corsair 35$ Call Options I bought for August 20 (and had bought much before the pump of Corsair) that i was forced to sell because it would have been ludicrous to keep them. The second was when I bought some calls on SOFI, expecting a short term jump after it crashed and ended up selling because it got pumped. I kept my shares in both, because I strongly believe in them and because the premiums are great for covered calls. I was in SOFI before it got pumped, and decided not to sell because I believe it is the next Ant Financial alongside Square, but for America (and eventually globally?). With that said, people who had done their DD would have known that EagleTree Capital/Insiders keep selling when the stock moves past 35. 

I digress, however. because I wanted to make some points. The first one is that there are people who have been pumping stocks they know to be shit because they want to make money off your hopium. This guy here is one: [Russell Reconstitution and why I believe $RIDE is the best play to capture gains : wallstreetbets (reddit.com)](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o6tev5/russell_reconstitution_and_why_i_believe_ride_is/) . To be clear, this was only one of a few posts made around that time, but I confronted the individual who has now deleted his account (you'll likely see why further down), because I knew people were going to get fucked without lube and I didn't want to see people lose their money. Ultimately, i was downvoted to pieces. However, i ended up being right, because now in addition to the SEC investigating Lordstown, the DOJ is now doing so as well:  [Justice Department Is Probing Lordstown Motors - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-is-probing-lordstown-motors-11625239730?mod=hp_lead_pos3). 

The second thing is that you guys are playing musical chairs with each other, and more often than not taking money from each other when you do your little ""short squeeze"" plays. Let me explain two things to you, and you'll understand why. The first is the concept of daily short interest fee, and the second is the concept of maintenance.

* The short interest Fee is calculated daily. What does that mean? Well if the short interest fee is 100%, and you have 1M dollars worth of shares sold short, then you multiply 1M by 100%. So, you literally do this 1,000,000\*1. Then you divide by 365. So 1,000,000/365=$2,739.72. So, we'll round up and say that the short interest fee is roughly 2.75K a day. While it can be punishing in the short term, in the aggregate, it will take a sustained period of high interest rate fees to actually dislodge someone that's sold short. You. as the buyers, are in essentially a prisoner's dilemma as you need to ""cooperate,"" but are also cognizant of the fact that when it all tumbles down it will tumble down hard. As anyone with half a brain cell can tell you, investing/trading is not a team game, and being first is what's important when it comes to these types of plays. To add to that, short sellers can add to their position at inflated prices, knowing that the vast majority of times the share price will decrease significantly because it has been artificially inflated. Let me be clear as to why it can be lucrative, by going back to my 1M dollar hypothesis. We know that 2.75K (rounded up) is how much you pay as a daily fee, but let's say that the stock you have sold short 1M dollars goes down by 1%. You are up 10,000 dollars, which means that even if the fee is elevated for a day or even a few days, the short seller still comes out on top.
* Maintenance requirements are a function of volatility, and maintenance requirements go up as volatility goes up. With that said, hedge funds do not go all in on  selling short one stock. They diversify. Which is why you usually see other companies that they are short on spike when one of their holdings is attacked by a ""short squeeze attempt."" It's because they are liquidating their (usually positive position) to post the collateral for the maintenance requirement as they wait you out with the understanding that 9.9 times out of ten the prisoner's dilemma will win out.
* Most of the time the companies these people short are unprofitable, or extremely ill, which means they dilute themselves and end up allowing people who sold short to exit mostly intact. This ends up hurting existing shareholders, as well as people who hoped to squeeze the short sellers. This is another form of the prisoner's dilemna.

For a successful short squeeze there are several elements in play that must be met for it to have a decent to strong chance of success. These elements do not have to be the same, but the broad strokes are usually the. For three successful ones, I would direct you to Volkswagen, Gamestop, and UWMC. If you want an explanation for why each one of them was met, i can explain below.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, this is for the Mods, as i believe that it's better to be constructive than critique mindlessly. These are my suggestions. 

1) Tier the Due Diligence Section. Have one section for approved individuals like /u/pennyether. Individuals who have made past contributions (with the caveat that they were well written and researched). The other section for unapproved individuals would function just as the current board does now for DD where anyone can post, with the understanding that most of the due diligence will be garbage but there will be diamonds in the rough so to speak as people post there who know what they are talking about. Once identified, even if the poster has only ever written that one due diligence post, they can be given access to the section for approved individuals.  I don't like to toot my own horn, but at least i cite my sources. 

Some other individuals i can think of other than Pennyether are 1) The guy who wrote about SKTelecom twice even though it was an OTC, 2) The guy who talked about MX, 3) /u/gingermanns though i disagreed voraciously with his legal argument.  4) Whoever originally wrote the OG RKT Earnings Play. 

2) Sticky a post describing all the steps it actually takes to do a short squeeze, and then make a rule stating that they have to advance a legitimate thesis/hypothesis about how it would come about using the guideline posted in the sticky. For example, force them to address the possibility of shareholder dilution etcetera. Then shut anything down resembling ""muh short squeeze"" that doesn't conform to that.

3) This is really something out of left field, but I've always questioned your ban on OTC tickers that met the minimum market cap requirement as there are a lot of good companies that have been posted here. CDProjectRed a few times, as well as the aforementioned SKT Telecom. The liquidity should not be a problem for these companies. If you believe that there is, however, you should increase the market cap requirement for OTC tickers but allow them with that heightened market cap requirement.

To end this all, I'd just like to clap back at some people who badmouth one of the fundamental analysis G.O.A.T.'s, and my boy, Warren ""The Bestest"" Buffet. 

He says ""Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful."" And the majority of you folks are greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy. Otherwise known as buying at the top, and selling at the bottom. 

So, you know, the GOAT's a winner, maybe listen to him a bit more."
2021-07-03 03:58:06,wallstreetbets,"Listen to Warren Buffett? Remember that HFs diversify? Jesus, dude, next thing you'll be talking about sharpe ratios, portfolio theory and the efficiency frontier. Don't you know stonks are a get-rich-quick-or-die-trying scheme? Everybody knows that hedge funds primarily work by ""APES TOGETHER STRONG"", that's why we do it too. In fact, the only reason we aren't beating the hedge funds hands down is they have special proprietary emojis we don't know anything about."

people like to accuse $ride enthusiasts as being a cult that only wants to see one side of things, but then do that very thing by only focusing on the negatives while ignoring many of the facts about how far along they are in their development and factory tooling up, the motor, etc.  its not like i'm oblivious to the information, and it is weighed for what it is in the larger picture.

I usually wait for a nice jump in price before selling a call well out of the money to get as much as I can out of the contract.  At first it was really fun and easy, now I have to have a spreadsheet to keep track.  I do not play the other side of the game though.  I am too afraid of selling covered puts, way too much to lose for not much reward.  I will sell cash secured puts on margin though, it's a great way to get into a stock you want while making money at the same time.

If you make a dollar a year in cash returns, you're making a 7.7% return annually on a cash basis. With that said, you're deep red on your paper return, so selling covered calls might not be the best way for you.

I'm surprised you didn't average down, may i ask why?"
2021-07-03 00:41:13,wallstreetbets,"He wants to however, which is the crux of the issue:

""A day after AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC) announced an investor outreach program that sent its share price skyrocketing, CEO Adam Aron held a video call with retail investors. Aron expressed a desire for the company to sell 25 million additional new shares; this news could trigger more volatility for the stock in the near term.  
  
The stock fell on Thursday following news that the company planned to sell 11 million additional shares, and it looks like management is angling for an even larger share offering. If such a move goes through, AMC could raise substantial capital -- and potentially pave the way for it to explore growth opportunities outside of the movie-theater space.  
  
Following recent explosive gains for the company's stock, AMC now has a market capitalization of roughly $26 billion -- up more than 5,300% year to date. Despite theaters in many territories now reopening and box office receipts showing signs of early stage recovery, the business's outlook remains somewhat bleak.   
  
Issuing new shares would likely have the effect of pushing the company's stock price down, but it could ultimately be in AMC's best interest. Despite the risk of substantial stock dilution, Aron pitched the new share offering to investors as a move that would create value. In yesterday's video call, the executive said, ""If we are not armed with this tool, then you're tying our hands behind our back and you'll make it just that much harder for us to land some of these attractive opportunities that could benefit us all.""   
  
However, a recent filing from the company also recommends that investors exercise caution with its stock -- highlighting recent pricing volatility and the potential for huge losses. Those without very high risk tolerance should probably steer clear of the stock for now.""

Hence, my point about dilution. 

You can find the article here, though i essentially copy pasted the body: https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/04/meme-stock-frenzy-amcs-ceo-wants-to-sell-up-to-25/#:\~:text=A%20day%20after%20AMC%20Entertainment%20Holdings%20%28%20NYSE%3AAMC%29,volatility%20for%20the%20stock%20in%20the%20near%20term."

Refinance will be a desert, so to speak, in the coming years (Though there will still be refinance activity). Finally, while RKT is trying to diversify (ergo, Rocket Auto) the line item only comprises a frankly tiny portion of their business and it will take years for them to derive any meaningful revenue from it.

2021-07-03 00:25:10,wallstreetbets,"There is no bubble, what ended up happening is that there was a severe undersupply of homes being built relative to what was needed after 2008. And it was by a significant degree. 

We now have a 3.8M house inventory shortage in the country as a significant age group (millenials) are aging into their prime home buying years.  This will take years to fix. There is also a estimated 1.2M homes that are needed every year just to keep up with year to year demand in ADDITION.

Home price appreciation will cool, according to the MBA/Fannie/Freddie to roughly 3-5% in 2022. 

You also have to understand the vast majority, if not all, of people who are buying houses for way over asking are also purchasing all cash. 

Finally, in a rising rate environment consumers become more price sensitive, and more likely to shop around for a lower rate. Mortgage Brokers offer, on average, 15 Basis Points in better rates than their retail counterparts because the consumer is not a captive customer and the broker is shopping around. 

I think, to be clear, people need to get out of the mindset that this is a bubble. With that said, if there was a bubble and it ""bursts"" the forbearance rate is significantly lower due to the credit ratings as showed by COVID. To add on to that, the CEO temporarily removed Jumbo and FHA offerings during the pandemic to reduce his risk.

2021-07-03 00:05:29,wallstreetbets,"You realize i had over $60,000 on UWMC right? Almost 7.5K shares. That includes a not insignificant portion on margin. I was, significantly, overweight on this stock. I realized profits, because I would be stupid not to, and i wanted to get out of margin with a significant profit.

However, to me, this is a lottery ticket INCOME stock. I showed another poster this, and I'll show you this now: [https://gyazo.com/471f922b6264239ddcf90edf2dfe074e](https://gyazo.com/471f922b6264239ddcf90edf2dfe074e) 

My cost basis is 7.51. The dividend yield on a cost basis of 7.51 is 5.32%, and was as much as 6.42% at one point in time. I dumped a not insignificant amount of money into this stock because it became extremely, extremely, undervalued. 

I receive 40 cents a year per share (which can grow), and can supplement that income with a further 5 cents a month (at ultra minimum) a month with selling  way, way, out of the money call options. That's 1$ a year, and that's a full ROI of 7.5 years, or less. That money will come in good days, or bad since I've done a calculation of the dividend payout ratio and it is excellent.

The company did squeeze as officially reported short interest as a percentage of float has decreased significantly, and as can be seen on Iborrowdesk here: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/UWMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/UWMC) 

I currently have roughly 20-25% of my portfolio in this stock. The margin of error is -5/+5% because of my call options on Cannae and CCS, where the options have wide bid/ask spreads. 

If it goes back below 7.51, I will reduce my cost basis because it is easy money, and I am in the business of making easy money. It will increase my interest yield, and FY yield on my covered call+dividend income as well.

In short, little reward, even if it gets pulled of. And high risk. It's mostly being kept alive by hopium. The short interest as a percentage of the float is roughly the same as AMC, maybe a little less. So anyone buying IN at these prices is likely going to have a case where the juice is not worth the squeeze if it occurs. And if there is a price increase, the likelihood is that you're more likely selling to other individuals fomoing in than a hedge fund. 

If AMC/GME can keep the prices elevated for months, even if 1-2 months. You'll likely see that 15-17% squeezer, and the resulting momentum and fomo trading pull it higher. This is with the caveat that the borrow fee remains elevated, and the IV remains high forcing a high maintenance requirement."

Furthermore, they have cheaper rates.

2021-07-03 12:05:59,wallstreetbets,Amc sat at $10 for months and months. Rather than buy then you bought at $51 I might give myself whiplash for shaking me head so hard.
2021-07-03 12:13:29,wallstreetbets,I wish you would also invest in WISH. But good luck anyways
2021-07-03 15:28:18,wallstreetbets,0.11% of your tendies are not safe

2021-07-03 10:54:50,wallstreetbets,"I took the other side of that bet right at the close. Sold off 200 contracts of the 49-53 call spread expiring 7/9/2021. Got 40k in cash, with 40k of my own cash at risk.

Need AMC to slowly grind down as the apes realize they are buying a pos company that has very few clients. If you want to do DD please go to an AMC this weekend and notice that the seats are only 1/3 filled. No chance they make profits at these traffic levels."
2021-07-03 11:00:07,wallstreetbets,The time to do this would have been months ago. I highly doubt AMC is going anywhere but down from here on out. It‚Äôs already overvalued.
2021-07-03 11:14:02,wallstreetbets,Are you fucking retarded
2021-07-02 21:39:27,wallstreetbets,Why?! Buy puts
2021-07-02 20:51:38,wallstreetbets,Shares are homo
2021-07-03 02:20:08,wallstreetbets,"From what I read on the Wide World of the Web, you made a contrary trade. Word is the apes have shot their wad and the bears are back. Good luck.

We are short $AMC. Fundamentals are obvious. After one month of trading sideways and lots of money lost in call options, the pump seems increasingly shaky.

2021-07-02 20:52:27,wallstreetbets,Why people still use robinhood is beyond me
2021-07-02 20:56:09,wallstreetbets,"Was senior manager there for years, know their model inside and out.

Bad investment.

They have no plans for the future, barely make money when things are booming, don't pay well, and because of covid online streaming became an option, companies will never invest in theater screenings like they used to again. AMC lost their leverage to negotiate ticket revenue with producers like Disney."
2021-07-02 21:00:42,wallstreetbets,"Good buy fellow APE, we're all in it for the long haul."
2021-07-02 21:08:14,wallstreetbets,Bought with the battery in the red. Steel balls my friend. He was never going to panic sell...

2021-07-02 22:38:05,wallstreetbets,I would recommend selling covered calls during spikes on a portion of your shares. You can recoup some of the losses on the dips with this strategy

2021-07-02 23:02:10,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm so high that I read it as ‚Äúyou will be either a millionaire or a billionaire.‚Äù I like that better honestly.

2021-07-03 01:30:30,wallstreetbets,"Maybe not billionaire but when AMC hits $100 he‚Äôll be very happy.

2021-07-02 21:42:43,wallstreetbets,"lol billionaire.  even if AMC ran to $1,051.11 he wouldn't even be a millionaire on return."
2021-07-03 00:24:03,wallstreetbets,"the stock price has to go to around $1,085,106 to be a billionaire"

2021-07-02 20:52:55,wallstreetbets,Moron for sure. AMC will continue to dilute with people like this willing to pay for it.
2021-07-02 21:50:22,wallstreetbets,I was thinking the same thing. I definitely wouldn't buy that much of my portfolio in anything let alone that price.
2021-07-02 22:42:22,wallstreetbets,My call is on moron

2021-07-03 00:19:38,wallstreetbets,Cant he be both?
2021-07-03 11:08:40,wallstreetbets,This boi gonna lose it
2021-07-02 22:07:08,wallstreetbets,You can‚Äôt lose if you never sell
2021-07-02 23:55:39,wallstreetbets,"Buy high, sell low if you‚Äôre a true ape."
2021-07-02 21:36:56,wallstreetbets,I'd give you gold if I wanted to give money to reddit
2021-07-02 21:57:05,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs the kind that will fuck you over for sure
2021-07-03 04:39:30,wallstreetbets,"He‚Äôs a shill, it‚Äôs likely a doctored screen shot. Any post on here using robinhood is an automatic red flag and should be to everyone
Also the mod bot shows his account is only a month old lol"
2021-07-03 10:08:29,wallstreetbets,Probably because people take screenshots around the time market closes so it‚Äôs been several hours of them using their phone all day.
2021-07-02 20:25:18,wallstreetbets,...with a lot of beer.
2021-07-03 01:36:37,wallstreetbets,"he showed up when the party started to get good, amc has a nice ass set up atm"
2021-07-02 22:10:22,wallstreetbets,when the eff is $AMC gonna push > $80?
2021-07-02 22:14:53,wallstreetbets,"They don‚Äôt wanna enter a position until there is confirmation bias‚Ä¶such as the stock going higher. Now that they‚Äôve seen it‚Äôs possible, they go all in. Makes no sense but oh well"
2021-07-02 20:19:39,wallstreetbets,Pffft I call cap. Op most likely had a stop loss set and it was met today. This is just him buying back in with a screenshot saying ‚Äú wish me luck‚Äù this is my first time yoloing 47k. I‚Äôve been asleep the entire 2021 and Decided this stock was it.
2021-07-03 00:44:38,wallstreetbets,Because thats probably all his savings and he doesn‚Äôt know of any other stocks besides what he sees recommended here. For so many of these its really that simple. They are just preying that the morons they listen to are right
2021-07-02 20:36:37,wallstreetbets,"probably because they just heard about it a week ago and waited for the sub-50 dip.

I bought in at 14. lol Should have bought more at $9. I knew it was gonna surge just because of the pandemic restrictions easing up in the west coast market.

Just... not as high as it did. lol"
2021-07-03 01:39:13,wallstreetbets,"cause now is better then never, when the risk VS reward the risk is going as low as apes will let it. the reward is looking at 1000%+ RIO on shares alone if the squeeze actually goes off."
2021-07-02 20:13:59,wallstreetbets,"> It just makes no sense

Sir, /r/stocks is the other way, this is a place for apes"
2021-07-02 20:35:59,wallstreetbets,"He's scalping and took a screenshot, probably already out of the position. I make buys like this daily. Go in for 1000 shares, take the leg up and bounce."
2021-07-02 20:37:03,wallstreetbets,It's probably fake
2021-07-02 21:10:26,wallstreetbets,Yea I don‚Äôt get it
2021-07-02 21:58:07,wallstreetbets,What has this place turned into? This place used to solely be options. It‚Äôs Wall Street BETS
2021-07-02 20:11:02,wallstreetbets,Why? So you can lose alot of money?
2021-07-02 20:27:54,wallstreetbets,I have this many shares and have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about but I‚Äôd like 2k a week please.
2021-07-02 21:12:30,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve seen people say the same thing about GME but the whole point of buying into these gambler stocks is that the price will fly to like a million. Selling CCs is, while wise, antithetical to the play as a whole."
2021-07-02 21:52:20,wallstreetbets,"You don't YOLO with shares

Has to be options"
2021-07-02 20:37:54,wallstreetbets,It's probably fake
2021-07-02 22:54:37,wallstreetbets,Alright grandma let‚Äôs get you to bed
2021-07-03 08:19:30,wallstreetbets,"They have to cover at some point, there's no loophole for that. Patience Grasshopper."
2021-07-02 20:58:43,wallstreetbets,24.25 shares at 10.15 that week my fellow smoothie. I just wanted to get them off robinhood... planned to buy them again but never got the chance.
2021-07-02 22:51:57,wallstreetbets,"You're not alone. I bought at $15. Once it hit that price again, I sold and figured it would dip (like before) and I could buy in at a lower price. Nope, shot up the next day. Could've made a cool $1.3k."
2021-07-02 20:51:59,wallstreetbets,At practically ATH too - great decision! Literally cannot go tits up.
2021-07-02 22:31:52,wallstreetbets,"I bought in at $14! But I sold at $9... 

Fuck AMC."
2021-07-02 20:41:03,wallstreetbets,100% fake
2021-07-02 21:22:57,wallstreetbets,Same. Robin hood is Robin people
2021-07-02 20:40:23,wallstreetbets,"Yup, lots of anti robinhood comments getting downvoted too. Crazy obvious at this point"

2021-07-02 22:14:45,wallstreetbets,Billionaire moron sounds like the best possible existence
2021-07-03 09:51:05,wallstreetbets,I can't get over how Robin Hood managed to kill all it's good will on this sub in one hour. I was about to make my first ever investment in AMC  in January when they blocked it. I immediately canceled my transfer and took my money elsewhere
2021-07-03 03:48:26,wallstreetbets,"It will never hit 100, you can set a reminder. Look at shares outstanding, you retards would need an insane amount of volume to ever surpass the previous ATH."
2021-07-03 00:08:49,wallstreetbets,You can't use if you don't sell. Meaning value is 0 if not selling...
2021-07-02 21:51:36,wallstreetbets,Use that money to buy puts on RH when they go public
2021-07-02 22:26:57,wallstreetbets,"Fuck reddit, they don't need money ""for server costs""."
2021-07-03 16:56:38,wallstreetbets,And there‚Äôs only 4 ppl left drunk out of their minds that couldn‚Äôt get an Uber because they got a bad rating from puking in one after last week‚Äôs party.

2021-07-02 20:55:24,wallstreetbets,"i bought in at $6 sold at $9, then bought in again at $60. am i doing it right?"
2021-07-03 10:56:37,wallstreetbets,But what if it does?????
2021-07-03 17:26:46,wallstreetbets,it‚Äôs going to drop to 29$ then rocket like GME so he‚Äôs just DCAing before the üöÄ
2021-07-02 21:10:42,wallstreetbets,I just don‚Äôt get it
2021-07-02 20:11:26,wallstreetbets,Yeah people were talking about the squeeze.. i mean it went 6$ to 74$ in a week... over 1000%..with no catalyst. That was the squeeze....ppl should of got out in the 70s.
2021-07-03 15:29:44,wallstreetbets,"Wow, basically the only pro-AMC comment I‚Äôve seen in this entire thread"
2021-07-02 20:19:14,wallstreetbets,lol why would apes complain about the birth of other apes.... they don't
2021-07-02 22:26:28,wallstreetbets,Delaying the squeeze.
2021-07-03 02:36:06,wallstreetbets,"I miss the old days of WSB--true degeneracy. One was either sucking dick behind a Wendy's dumpster because they lost it all, or sucking ladyboy dick on one's own yacht. It's basically r/investing at this point. 

PUT THE BETS BACK IN WALLSTREETBETS!"
2021-07-03 00:20:34,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not saying that shares are always the right choice, but for AMC I think they are."
2021-07-02 20:56:15,wallstreetbets,"You might get more $$$ (or not), but you are exposed to so much more risk, plus you could be selling calls."
2021-07-03 00:26:32,wallstreetbets,"Also smart. I never said that I knew what I was talking about. I don‚Äôt think the shares will go to zero, but options often do. Plus, 10 1/21/22 $55c will run you 1/2 of what he spent, not a 1/10th or 1/20th. And I think buying shares has more influence on price then options do, but I‚Äôm a retard."
2021-07-02 20:10:35,wallstreetbets,I concur.
2021-07-03 01:42:07,wallstreetbets,So we control more shares that wont be allowed to be used for shorts to cover..? And thinking you can lose anywhere NEAR the amount of money on shares as you can lose on options is... lol stick around here longer and youll see some truly fap-worthy losses
2021-07-02 20:47:13,wallstreetbets,No. So you can make more money.
2021-07-02 20:04:43,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but OP bought these presumably because he‚Äôs bullish. Why the fuck would he sell away his infinite upside? And keep all the downside risk in this volatile stock. I get that IV is high so he can make decent income, but it‚Äôs a yolo lol not a theta / Vega play..."
2021-07-02 21:32:27,wallstreetbets,Can you explain this
2021-07-02 22:19:44,wallstreetbets,then he will miss the fucking moon rocket you two retards
2021-07-02 22:18:52,wallstreetbets,Read up on r/thetagang and look up Kamikaze Cash's video's on youtube. **Do not sell naked calls**.
2021-07-03 00:50:03,wallstreetbets,"It absolutely is a yolo, a dumb one üòÇ

Commons on emem stocks is a dumb investment. The whole appeal is them shooting up a lot and getting out before they come down. 

Calls let you leverage that to absurd levels. Commons bought too high will stay commons for a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG time. Potentially years."
2021-07-02 20:56:16,wallstreetbets,Agreed. Especially considering the Reddit account info
2021-07-02 20:37:45,wallstreetbets,Lol robinhood literally said they would halt trading again
2021-07-03 15:39:45,wallstreetbets,True I just hope other ü¶ç remember the only thing left to do is hold

2021-07-02 23:01:42,wallstreetbets,"Watching AMC going down, sold it at lower price must be painful.

Then, watching AMC stock reversal from $9 to $60 and missed all the profit is beyond imagination."
2021-07-03 05:37:34,wallstreetbets,I made my 11k into 50k so was it?
2021-07-02 22:00:42,wallstreetbets,Won't anyone think of the ~~children~~ light mode!?
2021-07-02 20:55:54,wallstreetbets,You want Think or Swim
2021-07-02 20:56:47,wallstreetbets,"I recommend webull. I don't actually trade with them but their mobile app is great for doing technical analysis with crayons. Robinhood has none, fidelity is clunky as all hell."
2021-07-02 21:35:26,wallstreetbets,"If you want to actually invest, stay out of this sub."
2021-07-02 20:10:47,wallstreetbets,"Because of the alleged corruption, incompetence and lawsuits alleging financial significant losses, market manipulation, and more."
2021-07-02 20:14:16,wallstreetbets,Dude get out. You're actually lucky if you don't have much to move. But get out
2021-07-02 20:33:48,wallstreetbets,"a lot of problems, when GME mooned the first time, they restricted trading accounts and sold shares off below market value for a lot of people."
2021-07-02 20:51:30,wallstreetbets,Webull is good. Graphs are better. Roobinhood I believe is a tool to be utilized. For instance having an additional broker will allow you 3 more day trades per week if that's your thing. But RH should maybe be a backup and never put any substantial money in there.
2021-07-02 21:01:40,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity doesn't let you do certain penny stocks which is some bs

Td ameritrade is a decent option but there's a flat fee for trades"
2021-07-02 21:02:40,wallstreetbets,"Yeah fidelity or even TDameritrade Etrade, etc. If AMC hits $500k a share I would be shocked if Robinhood didnt ‚Äúcrash‚Äù until it came back down."
2021-07-02 21:05:54,wallstreetbets,I use fidelity.
2021-07-02 22:00:34,wallstreetbets,Fidelity.
2021-07-02 22:22:38,wallstreetbets,"I switched from RH to Fidelity a few months ago. It's a lot easier to sleep at night knowing that my money is safe and out of the hands of that Bulgarian asshole, Vlad."
2021-07-02 22:42:55,wallstreetbets,Fidelity is a great choice
2021-07-02 22:46:25,wallstreetbets,"Tastyworks has free stock trades like the rest, low commission on options and great tools for seeing probability of profit, standard deviations, general consensus of movement via option volume and any other trade metric you can think of plus more you never heard of. Free to open account plus tons of training material via partner network TastyTrade. Definitely give them a look.

Edit: futures too and even a new concept called mini futures for folks trying to get into futures without as much capital. (Futures are leveraged 1000:1.)

Edit 2: I wanted to verify my stock comment, turns out no, to buy 100 shares it‚Äôs $20 commission and $53 in fees. So yeah if just looking for free stock trade maybe somewhere else. However that is the cap so even if you trade 100000 shares that all you pay."
2021-07-02 23:23:24,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity is OP,  especially if you don't know what you're doing and need the assistance of an actual human."
2021-07-02 23:43:55,wallstreetbets,"robinhood just got fined 70mil (largest ever FINRA penalty) bc of their bullshit and they already seem to be hurting considering what they've been pulling. their ""apology"" was a non-apology and they didn't even promise not to restrict trading in the future. they're actually going public sometime this year, think i'll be shorting and buying puts haha."
2021-07-03 01:41:53,wallstreetbets,Main reason: RH executes orders through Citadel and sells data to these market makers. Huge conflict of interest and is the root of what people have mentioned here.
2021-07-03 01:42:33,wallstreetbets,RH chugges cocks

2021-07-03 12:03:26,wallstreetbets,Have you read anything ever
2021-07-03 15:40:35,wallstreetbets,"What, other than the fact they stopped buying on GME, regularly go down when coin is climbing, have regular midday trading outages, I see now reason to leave, do you?"
2021-07-03 15:42:06,wallstreetbets,They shut off buying on lots of stocks during gme. For me it's more about the fact they crashed during March 2020 sell off and cost me an extra 20% of my portfolio watching everything dip while Robinhood told me technical difficulties try selling later. It's not the first time Robinhood crashed on me and I doubt it will be the last.
2021-07-02 20:38:39,wallstreetbets,">  My friend keeps hyping it 

why. does he live in a cave?"
2021-07-02 20:43:31,wallstreetbets,"If you'd like to start investing and specifically options don't listen to shitheads here. Bunch of them are noob üÖ±Ô∏èunts. Go to r/options , r/thetagang for learning. Read their wiki and resources.  Watch kamikaze cash or inthemoney on YouTube. If you‚Äôre serious about investing also look at Bogleheads. Robinhood is a good starter platform. Read my other comment about major brokerages doing similar restrictions at the gme volatility peak. There are downsides to robinhood it‚Äôs a beginner friendly gamified platform but it works for most of the people. Thinkorswim is the best trading platform out there imo. You can slowly graduate to advance platforms once you get a hang of it"
2021-07-02 21:25:12,wallstreetbets,"People here hold grudges.

if your just trading stocks and not fucking with options you‚Äôll be fine"
2021-07-02 21:37:08,wallstreetbets,"Webull is really good too, check them out as well"
2021-07-02 21:36:27,wallstreetbets,Take the info as you are given. These guys hate on Robinhood but if you have no idea about trade options and want to learn robinhood is the easiest to put a spread and the easiest to understand. These dickheads are going to fuck you out of money because you‚Äôre not even going to understand what you are looking at. Robinhood is fine and many people have made plenty on it. Millions and more. Most of these cucks have no experience investing they just buy gme and amc hoping they will be rich on highs. Even though they are shit companies and the position is short and they will end up with half of their money or less. Do what you think is right
2021-07-02 21:39:31,wallstreetbets,I like tastyworks for options. Fidelity is nice for shares. E-Trade is good but for bigger accounts. There's so many good ones out there. Literally anything except Robinhood
2021-07-03 16:25:32,wallstreetbets,GameStop literally went to $483 a share and you‚Äôre doubting this hard? You must work at Melvin.
2021-07-03 11:03:09,wallstreetbets,. No don't do that! Could be a bear trap. Stay away from that ipo

2021-07-03 01:27:03,wallstreetbets,the guy you sold to at 9 and bought back from at 60 thinks so
2021-07-03 17:27:54,wallstreetbets,"I bought exactly 1 share at 50$ just in case something wild happens and then I get to be a part of the meme. If not, ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø. It‚Äôs only 50$."
2021-07-02 21:25:03,wallstreetbets,"I just have to ask, AMCs run-up went something like:

Day 1: $14
Day 2: $18
Day 3: $22
Day 4: $32
Day 5: $31
Day 6: $65

Did you really see it going up so much and wait a full trading week to buy in at $60? Or was this recently since the price has been hovering around $55-$60?

Can‚Äôt clown you though. The only reason I didn‚Äôt cash out at $13.50 in March was because at the time I was on unemployment, and didn‚Äôt want to risk losing it. As it was paying more than the profits I would make if I were to get cut off. 

And It was easy for me to hold though as I spent all my money on GME back in feb and used a few bucks on AMC for the hell of it. So unless I saw it go up 1000% or more, taxes would eat so much profit that I may as well just pick up another shift at work."
2021-07-03 16:00:26,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs why I still hold a few shares. But I cashed out most to roll those profits into Gme as I believe that is the one true moon stock.

But hey, I thought this dude that yolo‚Äôd his retirement into amc back in may for $13/share was an idiot. Then less than 2 weeks later he‚Äôs up 400% so who knows"
2021-07-03 02:00:40,wallstreetbets,Why to many people cry for other people investing in AMC.. if you guys want to keep adding money to GME just do it‚Ä¶ if we want to keep adding money to AMC WE WILL  .. that‚Äôs all I have to say (xxxx shares in AMC) with 500% + gain and No plan to sell yet ü§≤üíéü¶ß

2021-07-03 02:45:45,wallstreetbets,"I do not think this is true. Options will net you more profit during a squeeze than shares, by a long shot. In the event that it crashes, you'll still lose 75 percent of your cash on shares. 

OP should have just yolo'd 25k in options"
2021-07-02 21:16:04,wallstreetbets,"You can still sell calls covered by deep ITM calls. You only need to guarantee to your broker that you can deliver the shares

Sauce: been my strategy for 3 months on my 2023 $20 calls"
2021-07-03 11:18:46,wallstreetbets,"I was looking at one or two month out options, they have less risk and lower cost, 50,000 on the line scares me silly while the op may have much deeper pockets."
2021-07-02 20:16:56,wallstreetbets,OP would just roll up if the stock started shooting up.
2021-07-02 21:57:09,wallstreetbets,I mean - it‚Äôs not infinite upside is it tho - The other ape ticker at least has some sort of modernisation plan‚Ä¶
2021-07-03 04:27:45,wallstreetbets,"Because you'd have to be a dumb motherfucker to expect AMC to go exponentially higher again. 

And those people are the ones that are gonna be buying your CCs. 

So you could theoretically keep waiting for AMC to hit 100+ or you could sell easy weeklies at 100 strikes and rake in literal free money. And if you're gonna be salty about having your CCs exercised on actual garbage stock that is sitting at 100 now after taking 100% in profits, then you're a special kinda fuck."
2021-07-03 03:50:39,wallstreetbets,"Infinite upside, you‚Äôre actually retarded"

2021-07-02 21:35:09,wallstreetbets,Except RH wasn‚Äôt the only app that stopped GME. So why do the other apps get a pass?
2021-07-02 22:19:48,wallstreetbets,We couldn't buy gme on almost every brokerage
2021-07-02 21:30:20,wallstreetbets,"Haha, ""outages"" makes it sound like it's an accident."
2021-07-02 20:42:35,wallstreetbets,Both of those platforms actually restricted meme stocks before Robin Hood during the whole fiasco

2021-07-02 21:58:34,wallstreetbets,"ThisüëÜ, I have fidelity, rh, and webull. Most of my shares are on fidelity. You don't understand how bad I want to transfer those shares from rh to Fidelity. I have heard bad things about Webull but I can't back it up, only been with webull for a month. Webull and Rh apps are easier to use imo. I do most of price checking there."
2021-07-02 22:36:26,wallstreetbets,Have they updated their app yet? I heard about some new UI coming.
2021-07-02 21:38:49,wallstreetbets,"RH ""news"" is FUD and post movement FOMO. Yes it tells you *why* a stock moved, after is already did."
2021-07-02 21:25:41,wallstreetbets,"I use fidelity,  but connected my acct through yahoo finance app...it way easier on the eyes and keeps track of everything with the acct.  The only time I open fidelity now is to make a purchase or check out options"
2021-07-02 20:26:46,wallstreetbets,How long does the transfer take? Am I transferring my shares or just dollar value or do I have to sell and buy back in? Not sure how it works tbh and don‚Äôt want to make a crucial mistake.
2021-07-02 22:26:24,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity's new UI on the iPhone looks A LOT better than their boomer version. It can still be better, for sure, but it's a great start. I'm not sure when they're releasing it on Android."

They only blocked buying for those stocks. At first it was a block on margin buying, then regular buying. Selling was available just fine throughout."

There isnt the same pressure and uncertainty, and certainly not the same online interest...I'm just curious why you wouldn't take your 500% increase and walk away happily? Don't be **that** retarded."
2021-07-03 18:31:59,wallstreetbets,"after the recent peak at $70, as it was coming down, i bought some around $60, now averaging down, got some more around $52, still bullish af üíéüôåüöÄüåï"

2021-07-02 20:36:21,wallstreetbets,"the premiums for amc were through the roof, especially in early june.  I wrote a june 4th $66 call for $1,400.  I wrote a june 11th 62 call for $1,200.  I was only doing these a week at a time.  AMC calls are still higher than normal but a lot of the volume and volatility have left.  In early june there was a day 500 million shares were traded and there is only that many shares outstanding.  Wild stuff."
2021-07-03 02:41:50,wallstreetbets,"June 21 ( weeklies atm were $8.55. Seven dollars out of the money were $6.85)
June 6 premiums were $11.30 for atm and seven dollars otm were $9.65. 
The $500 is an average over the 2-3 months. Math and research is hard. Don‚Äôt trade them. I could care less. Each of those prices were 3-4 expiring that Friday and were Monday/Tuesday prices. They have been like this for 2 months. The volatility has slowed down and the premiums have come down $50-70%. Atm puts were $10.65 and 5 otm puts were $7.40. All the premium prices are online for you to research for may/June. Sorry if this is hard for you to grasp. Gme 3 weeks Ago was $12.25 atm 3 days out ans $9.09 fifteen dollars otm. I don‚Äôt know how to post a picture or I would post pics. It‚Äôs easy to look. Barchart shows you high IV prices and you can trade those options. It‚Äôs not hard. Math and google is your friend."

You and your dumb butt buddy who missed the big money can cry and circle jerk with each other and your $800 portfolios. Gme and tsla premiums were crazy high 4-8 weeks ago too. Volatility caused those high prices. It‚Äôs traded sideways for a month so prices came down. Read more, post less. Might learn something"
2021-07-03 02:55:48,wallstreetbets,"Here is a video with a kid questioning these crazy prices too in mid June and he shows the prices live on screen. Proof is there. Have fun trading penny stocks. leave making money to the rest of us

2021-07-03 07:48:51,wallstreetbets,"lmao you are so clueless.  if this guy buys AMC to bet on the short squeeze, it doesnt matter if you can roll options up and out. He doesnt have the money the buy the options back and will be bag holding. you should educate yourself about the risk of selling covered calls first. Tell me, if AMC goes to 5000 bucks and drop to 10 in a week, how do you sell covered call and be profitable?"
2021-07-02 21:18:36,wallstreetbets,Oh bwooiiiiii.....keep it rollin. No question is ever dumb.ü§î

2021-07-02 22:04:06,wallstreetbets,Robinhood restricted in unimaginable more bullshit ways. Others lifted the restrictions quickly but Robinhood restricted for over a week.
2021-07-02 22:06:31,wallstreetbets,They don‚Äôt! Webull disabled the rocket button as well. I moved to fidelity
2021-07-02 22:02:51,wallstreetbets,> implying people here actually know more than 2-3 investing apps
2021-07-02 20:25:58,wallstreetbets,I believe they couldn't afford all the buy orders and they didn't want their bffs to lose
2021-07-02 21:25:57,wallstreetbets,They were t the only ones to halt trading
2021-07-02 21:58:40,wallstreetbets,Then they should have halted buying AND selling. They did not.
2021-07-02 20:04:32,wallstreetbets,"Did every major broker deal with multiple outages like Robinhood during times of volatility? I know different brokers had varying levels of restrictions on volatile stocks early this year. Some restricted all buying, some restricted options I think, some restricted to cash only not margin? I haven't personally verified, but I recall reading that Fidelity and Vanguard had little or no restrictions."
2021-07-02 21:29:02,wallstreetbets,This x1million
2021-07-02 20:08:30,wallstreetbets,Shill. 20 day old account. Robinhood is the worst broker in human history. Corrupt motejrfuckers. No true ape with a lick on sence would ever use it.
2021-07-02 20:56:57,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity didn‚Äôt ever restrict buying on these 2 stocks, quit lying you sleezeball"

2021-07-03 03:57:45,wallstreetbets,Is there a reason people have multiple accounts? Or is it just the aftermath of switching after not being satisfied
2021-07-02 22:55:40,wallstreetbets,"The big problem with Webull is that they use APEX as their clearing house, which is the same one as Robinhood. So basically if RH has problems with order restrictions, Webull is going to get the exact same problem. 

It's frustrating though because Webulls apps are really nice compared to the competition. Fidelities apps looking like some crusty windows 95 application."
2021-07-02 23:36:12,wallstreetbets,What do you think news is lol
2021-07-02 23:27:02,wallstreetbets,"I'll have to check that out, did not know that was a thing."

2021-07-02 21:25:12,wallstreetbets,I use Merrill and their app isn't so bad.
2021-07-02 21:31:29,wallstreetbets,"That probably wont last long. Im with schwab and the app sucks but yes, peace of mind and im sure they are working on a new gen"
2021-07-02 20:32:38,wallstreetbets,"5-7 business days.  I just started my transfer, so I can‚Äôt give an exact duration.  My girlfriend‚Äôs transfer from RH to Vanguard took 7 business days.

But they transferring everything in my account (cash and stocks).  Crypto can‚Äôt be transferred, it would have to be liquidated, but I don‚Äôt have any crypto on RH."
2021-07-02 21:18:43,wallstreetbets,I finally did it this week on the 29th. They told me it would be done by July 7th and it was actually done by the 1st!
2021-07-02 21:37:38,wallstreetbets,"When I transfered it took 9, cause of a holiday (I think). So watch for that"
2021-07-03 02:34:18,wallstreetbets,Yup! Fidelity Beta.. only for iOS it‚Äôs dope
2021-07-03 08:44:22,wallstreetbets,"Right, except when robinhood decides to do it themselves. They stopped letting people buy before and they've confirmed that they'll do it again. Not to mention all the other ways they've fucked over retail investors."
2021-07-02 21:30:19,wallstreetbets,Well that's fine because it's halted for everyone. But when Robinhood decides to halt trading and the rest of the world is still trading that's a problem.
2021-07-02 22:50:11,wallstreetbets,I remember Digg... didn't last long lol

2021-07-03 09:06:46,wallstreetbets,there is a little button on the trading screen labeled roll.  it simultaneously buys your contract back and allows you to sell a new one.  the trading house just lets you resell against your shares.  when the stock is pumping you roll up and out to secure a higher strike and more proceeds....its literally like 1 click
2021-07-02 21:53:31,wallstreetbets,"Holy fuck, time flies"
2021-07-02 20:34:04,wallstreetbets,How dare they be pissed off about being unable to buy shares and their stock plummeting. Outlandish Reddit mob strikes again.
2021-07-02 20:19:46,wallstreetbets,"Well, to be fair, since then they've raised billions in capital from their investors specifically for this purpose."
2021-07-02 20:49:37,wallstreetbets,"My understanding was this: when they used the clearinghouses, the clearinghouse would  make them pay like %10 of the purchase price up front in order to initiate the trade. Most of the time, they could float that for a day or two while the trade settled. 

In times of volatility, that percentage would increase, and in GME's case, it was like 100%. With as many panicked orders as were coming in, RH (supposedly) would've needed an astronomical amount of capital (basically, they'd have to float the entire squeeze), so they basically just disabled the buy button. 

Now, I don't know if that's how it works, but that's what I've seen on YT."
2021-07-02 21:27:22,wallstreetbets,"No business model coulda helped

2021-07-02 20:40:08,wallstreetbets,"Yes, so you transfer to WeBull who does the same thing with the same business model‚Ä¶."
2021-07-02 21:31:31,wallstreetbets,Funny I don't use them and could freely trade any stock any time I wanted.
2021-07-02 22:42:19,wallstreetbets,Tastyworks had a few hours where you couldn't trade some of the meme tickers.  I believe I heard that TDAmeritrade disabled buys on GME too.  Both Tasty and Ameritrade sell order flow and use clearing houses.   But Ameritrade has self-clearing too.  These guys didn't block nearly as long as Robinhood did though.
2021-07-02 20:09:19,wallstreetbets,Have you traded options on vanguard? They work harder to keep people like wsb from trading options on their platform. What about TDA? etrade? Interactive brokers? Schwab?
2021-07-02 21:31:04,wallstreetbets,"Is Robinhood really as big as vanguard?   


Robinhood hit mainstream what 2 years ago?"

2021-07-03 09:14:32,wallstreetbets,"I've got accounts at TD Ameritrade (hold over from Scottrade- yes, I am old, username checks out), RH, WeBull, and SoFi, all have different functions, funding levels, and different reasons to exist.  RH has the best rate on leverage, SoFi doesn't support margin (and that's perfect for the college fund Im building for a grand daughter), TDA has great research tools, WeBull has a nice Level II pricing feature that sometimes helps me understand momentum and optimize buy/sell points.

Sometimes, just keeping funding streams chasing different objectives in separate accounts helps me visualize where I'm succeeding and where I need to do more research."
2021-07-03 06:50:26,wallstreetbets,I got multiple just in case one goes down during the squeeze.
2021-07-03 00:27:05,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but that's because Fidelity is not designed to be a trading platform. If they had a product like rh or webull then you can bet that it'll be the same payment for order flow bullshit. The only reason why it's more dependable right now is because Fidelity is banking on your using their other services and investment products"
2021-07-03 09:21:17,wallstreetbets,I mean all news shouldn't be propaganda lol
2021-07-03 02:06:09,wallstreetbets,"Np, it does make things way easier to look through"
2021-07-02 21:27:45,wallstreetbets,"You should try TD ameritrade then, their thinkorswim UI seems to be liked by this sub."
2021-07-02 21:08:00,wallstreetbets,SoFi.  Not for options obviously but just to hold longs.
2021-07-02 20:18:26,wallstreetbets,Ameritrade has a shit app as well.
2021-07-02 21:23:34,wallstreetbets,"You're just selling calls on shares you own. You know what calls are, right? When you buy a contract that says you can buy 100 shares at X price within a certain amount of time? Well in this scenario you're the one selling those contracts because you own the stock. If the price never makes it past the X price by the end of the contract, the contract expires worthless and you keep the contract money and your stock and do it again."
2021-07-02 23:30:43,wallstreetbets,"Let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôre holding 100 shares of AMC, currently priced at 50. 

We‚Äôre using 100 shares because options are sold in batches of 100. So 1 option contract would be referring to 100 shares. 

To make money by selling covered calls, you‚Äôd be selling someone the OPTION to buy your 100 shares at a certain price by a certain date.

It‚Äôs an OPTION contract because they get to decide if they‚Äôd like to exercise the contract or not. You must abide by their decision. 

For our example, we‚Äôll say you sell someone the option to buy your 100 shares for 55 (that‚Äôs called the strike price) by next week. You charge them $2/share. Since options are sold in batches of 100, the buyer pays you $200 for the option to buy your 100 shares at 55 by next week. 

**A few points**

-	if they decide to exercise their option, you must sell your shares to them at 55, regardless of whether it‚Äôs at 56, 60, 500 or 500,000.
-	They can exercise it before the expiration date but it rarely happens. 
-	The buyer never has to buy it from you but they always will if the stock bid price is higher then the strike price on the expiration date.
-	The more volatile a stock is, the more you can charge for the option. 
-	The further away the expiration date is, the more you can charge.

**Example prices on expiration date**

Price: 60

The stock went up 10 points. Normally, that would mean you‚Äôd have made $1,000 (10 point increase X 100 shares). 

However, you promised to sell it to someone at 55, so you have $500 you made on the 5 point increase from 50 to 55 plus the $200 you made from selling the option. 

That‚Äôs a $700 gain but less than the $1,000 you would‚Äôve made had you not sold the option. 

Price: 56

Had you not sold the option, you‚Äôd be up $600. Since you had to sell your shares to someone at 55, you only gained $500 from the run up to 55. However, the $200 you got from the option contract gives you a total gain of $700. That‚Äôs $100 more profit thanks to the option you sold. 

Price: 54 (the sweet spot for you)

You gained $400 from the 4 point increase and $200 from the option. Without the sale of the option, it would only be a profit of $400. With the sale, you made $200 more. 

Since it‚Äôs below the strike price, the buyer never exercised their option to buy (since it‚Äôs cheaper for them to buy directly at 54), allowing you to keep your shares and sell a new option to someone else for another $200.

Ideally, the stock keeps going up but stays just shy of the strike price. You keep making money on the share price increase and make extra profit by selling options that end up worthless to the buyer.

The only time you ‚Äúlose‚Äù money selling options is when the stock is priced over over 57 (55 strike price + 2 contract price). 

You still came out with $700 profit but you miss out on the extra profit you could have made by not having to sell your stock at the lower 55 price. 

A lot of people don‚Äôt like selling options on these squeezing stocks because they expect a major move upwards and don‚Äôt want to be forced to sell at the lower strike price. 

Fuck me, why did I type all this shit out when I could‚Äôve just linked you to a YouTube video ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

2021-07-02 21:38:56,wallstreetbets,Thinkorswim is dogshit to look at but it's great when you get a handle of the metric fuck ton of stuff you can do with it. It also allows futures and forex after you get approved for them.

Also, even with the move in IBM today, it's important to have puts that encapsulate the July 19th earnings release. The 23Jul 135 puts should expire well ITM.. if the abrupt departure of management positions following Q2 foreshadows any underperformance in relation to guidance.

From Tech Crunch:

""In a surprise announcement today, IBM announced that Jim Whitehurst, who came over in the Red Hat deal, would be stepping down as company president just 14 months after taking over in that role.""

IBM didn‚Äôt give a lot of details as to why he was stepping away, but acknowledged his key role in helping bring the 2018 $34 billion Red Hat deal to fruition and helping bring the two companies together after the deal closed. ‚ÄúJim has been instrumental in articulating IBM‚Äôs strategy, but also, in ensuring that IBM and Red Hat work well together and that our technology platforms and innovations provide more value to our clients,‚Äù the company stated.

He will stay on as a senior adviser to Krishna, but it begs the question why he is leaving after such a short time in the role."

After making roughly 30% on my AMC play (thanks Apes) I have decided to do my first YOLO with a modest $12,500 and have chosen to drop it in DHCA. I purchased 1,256 shares at roughly $9.80 all based on the fact I‚Äôm trying to get ahead of the rush (I got in AMC in the high 40s) DHCA is currently in talks with FreeWire for a SPAC merger. Under president Biden‚Äôs infrastructure plan (let‚Äôs not go down the political road we just want tendies) the US is planned to build 500,000 EV charging stations by 2030. In comparison there are under 150,000 gas stations currently in the US. This is a quick play for me, if the SPAC goes through I envision this thing being like ChargePoint (CHPT) currently trading in the low $30s.

Even for a higher pay, I just couldn't be arsed to be a career person going from job to job, stressing about work on my free time and dealing with layoffs. Just not worth it when my job already pays enough for my mortgage and modest living expenses.

So, I kind of like being stuck where I am. Not too stressful and have enough free time to tinker with stonks.

Pretty soon, the standard of living will be; one person living in a small government-subsidized box, work 12 hours a day, and all your money will go to renting the box, healthcare, food, taxes, and other necessities. Society will become ultra-efficient at taking all of your money, so you won't be able to save, or better your lot in life. Since jobs will be hard to come by, half the people will have a government job while the other half pay super-high taxes to pay for this ever-expanding government.

2021-07-03 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Infrastructure play - $PTRA Proterra EV bus company One of the biggest pushes of the Biden Admin is renewable energy, if you take a look at the bipartisan bill there is a hefty chunk set towards electric vehicles, and some of that is going to electrification of public transit.

&#x200B;

[Proposed Infrastructure Bill](https://preview.redd.it/kl884svygu871.png?width=588&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b040ef97f0051dd43f0bdd303d29e3c736a5426)

The tax credits that will go towards buying EV transportation is massive and currently, not many public transit buses are electric, nor do we have the charging stations in place to support these needs.

Proterra the largest American EV transit bus company that makes their own batteries, charging stations and buses. I did not highlight it in the above image, but technically they could also dip into the EV infrastructure with their charging stations as well.

**This is where it gets interesting.**

Jennifer Granholm. She is the current Secretary of Energy for the Biden administration. You know what else she is? She was a board member for Proterra, taking the new position she had to sell off her shares and resign from her role, but she knows what they are capable of and Biden even did a tour of their facilities.

Miami just signed on to take 42 more buses from Proterra, while they already had 33, bringing their total to 75. If they are ordering more, the product works and doesn't just roll down a hill.

As of [yesterday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fta-awards-low-no-emission-120000508.html) they were awarded low or no emission program grants to 10 transit agencies to procure Proterra electric transit buses, charging infrastructure and Proterra Powered low-floor shuttles in partnership with Optimal Electric Vehicles. I am not able to find what transit authorities they were approved with, but I don't think small time transit agencies would be approved for transit buses, shuttles and the charging stations.

Lastly, the stock is heavily shorted, as seen in this [article](https://elmerspud.substack.com/p/a-speculative-but-not-crazy-speculative) here that goes into all this with a bit more detail. The borrow fee a week ago was sitting at 86%.

TLDR

EV transit buses, Biden likes renewable energy, make own batteries, charging stations and bus. Infrastructure bill giving huge tax credits to EV transit.

I have 25 12/17 17.5c, that cost me 2.53 and be picking up more shares right before gov comes off break. Stock price is currently 16.80 as I'm writing this."

2021-07-03 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Opinion: Valuation of Robinhood from their S-4 filings makes $SoFi a bargain in the long term. **Summary: This is a speculative piece that I came up with after Robinhood released their S-4 filings for their IPO. I use that to compare the growth potential of SoFi, particularly SoFi invest.**

From Robinhood '[S-4 Filing](https://sec.report/CIK/0001783879):

Robinhood grew around 300% due to the 2020 meme stocks and coins frenzy, and most of its customer base is born in the 90s. From its S-4 filings, Robinhood is targeting a valuation of $40 Billion from their IPO (I know, it's absurd right?).

Why I **speculate** SoFi invest will grow rapidly in the future:

When compared to Sofi's roughly $18B valuation (assuming stock price around $20). I speculate that over time, as SoFi Invest gets more features, it will become more popular among the same age group, and perhaps for the upcoming young adults due to students loan repayment as well as other products. I also speculate achieving feature parity to Robinhood won't be a challenge for SoFi (and perhaps having more basic features like charts, PNL data, etc.). Other than that, SoFi invest needs to allow non-residents residing in the US to be able to open an invest account. Anthony Noto has shared some of the much-needed features in their current roadmap (options, margin) which makes me excited about the future of Sofi Invest.

And of course, when we start including their other products' potential growth (galileo, banking), their expansion to other Countries (some are speculating Singapore is already underway), and more products being added to their existing platform, I am really excited about SoFi's long term growth. This makes me believe that SoFi's current valuation is a bargain.

2021-07-03 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"RIG: Revised DD with new Technical Outlook Hello fellow traders,

I previously submitted a DD for RIG and feel that I need to update the DD based on the recent price action.

Previously DD:

With 14% short, which accounts for 74.9 Million shares currently being shorted on this stock. Past 6 months, the Transocean director paid 40.7 million from June 7 to June 22 to purchase 9.9 million shares on the open market, which along with a rising oil price, could potentially be another AMC in the making.

Shorts: Currently there are 569 million shares floating with 7.5% held by insiders, 54.52 held by institutions,s and well over 14% short of float, which accounts for almost 75 million shares of outstanding shares. Given the rising oil price and domestic market recovery, there is an increase in the demand, in addition to the cyclical summer demand for gas.

Insider: Insiders have been scooping up shares, which is an indication of confidence in the stability of oil prices and demand moving forward. ""Transocean director Frederik W. Mohn paid $40.7 million from June 15 through June 22 for a total of 9.9 million shares, a per-share average price of $4.11. Mohn made the purchases through Perestroika AS, a Norwegian investment firm of which he is the sole director and owner, according to a form he filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Perestroika now owns 77.6 million Transocean shares. **It was Mohn‚Äôs first purchase of Transocean stock on the open market since 2018**.""

Technical Outlook: Resistance at $4.81 as a 52-week high. Currently, the stock is looking to break out and breakthrough that resistance. I expect the stock will go higher and potentially retest the $4.81 as the new support and then reaches new highs. Next potential resistance at $7.00 range and then at each dollar mark, roughly. However, if short squeezed, the stock price could increase exponentially.

Revised technical outlook:

Tuesday:

Price action on Tuesday, there was a spike of volume and price that hit an interim 52-week high of 4.86, which was above the previous $4.81. Obviously, it got smacked down after reaching that new high thereafter.

&#x200B;

Wednesday was not meaningful

Thursday:

Thursday got interesting in the first 15 minutes, the price spike to $5.07 with heavy volume, approximately 10 million shares during that 15 minutes span and broke through the previous $4.81 resistance and trying to establish that as the new support line, which held several times throughout the day.

Friday:

Today is another confirmation of that support through the day thus far and expect continued strength throughout the and expect the $5 as the first support line and $4.81 as the second support.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9aoux9kxzt871.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe0b502315cd3efffa9fb8c482556f0b5dfc4b31

Outlook:

I fully expect these volumes will continue to maintain with shorts starting to cover their outstanding floating shares as the price increases, which bold favorably for RIG. I expect the short% float will start to decrease from the current 14% and into the low single-digit since there is really no value for them to continue the short positions.  Honestly, how much lower can $5 go vs. the risk of stock going significantly upside.  This will also coincide with the increased demand on the oil price.  

Risk:

Geopolitical risk will be a factor in the oil price, which will definitely impact RIG's price.

Disclaimer: Currently I'm long RIG and looking for an entry point for a LEAP option play.

YOU ARE WRONG.

Them Jan '22 40 calls are (mis)priced at 15-25 bucks for some retarded reason... Whoever is selling those is an idiot from thetagang who didn't read what VICI actually does. If I get my $43 bucks then that $20 call is now a 15 bagger.

>""BUT ODGRIM! There's NO WAY this shitstock is going to go up to $43 bucks and take you to tendy town. You are retarded.""

HALF WRONG

I may be retarded but I'm calling VICI to $43 by Jan '22 for 3 reasons:

1. VICI IS A REIT- REITs are priced by their net assets and divvy yield
2. VICI's divvy is set to go up because they have a lot of money coming in and they LITERALLY AND LEGALLY have to give 90% of it away or lose their REIT status.
3. VICI bought the BIGGEST casino in Vegas that your wife's boyfriend takes her to on vacation- The Venetian. A BIG ASSET.
   1. They already OWN or have Rights of First Dibs to buy almost a third of the LV strip

https://preview.redd.it/8n3s1jwjvx871.jpg?width=1074&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bb56eb8905424457f0b55cb6a49096d1b227526

Rival Virgin Orbit, the sister company of **Virgin Galactic** ([**SPCE**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPCE)), is reportedly in talks to go public through the SPAC **NextGen Acquisition II** ([**NGCA**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NGCA)).

[$ASTR Daily Candlestick Chart](https://preview.redd.it/bvc0kzxl2x871.jpg?width=1026&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f09ca5098eba971caf6a267705749b7d0815b35e)

Small satellites are becoming popular for expanding internet access across the globe. Astra can launch satellites weighing 100 pounds but plans to increase that load number. The company plans to start commercial launch service for customers this summer and then move to daily launches by 2025. ASTR ticker has publicly committed to 15 launches as it works through 50 customers under contract.

The venture expects to be carrying out daily launches to low-Earth-orbit (LEO) by 2025.

‚ÄúWhat is really starting to cause Astra to stand out from everyone else out there is our focus on scale,‚Äù Astra CEO Chris Kemp told SpaceNews in an interview. Not the scale of the rocket, but the scale of the factory and the scale of production and the number of launches.‚Äù

He said customers are willing to pay a lot more for responsiveness than ‚Äúwaiting six months or a year‚Äù for launches that could potentially face more delays.

&#x200B;

Alameda, California-based Astra has been hiring former SpaceX employees that helped set up the Falcon 9 production line, as well as senior staff from Tesla from the Bay Area, to help scale up its factory facilities to meet this demand.

Benjamin Lyon, who spent more than two decades supporting the mass production of Apple products, including iPhones and iPads, joined Astra as chief engineer in February.

Astra anticipates unveiling its first customer when a launch date this summer for its upgraded Rocket 3.3 has been set. It will be its first launch since Rocket 3.2 fell just shy of reaching orbit in a Dec. 15 demo mission after running out of fuel early.

Astra‚Äôs SPAC merger proceeds will help scale up operations and expand its vertically integrated approach to space, which June 7 saw it acquire electric propulsion venture Apollo Fusion in a deal valued at up to $145 million.

Apollo Fusion thrusters will boost Astra‚Äôs move into the small satellite manufacturing business next year, enabling it to provide launch and space services beyond LEO.

https://preview.redd.it/18ophdeo62971.jpg?width=955&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5827ff8473b003b8e9c9852ac5cc54f30c3d76bc

Astra also plans to grow the payload capacity of its rockets from 50 kilograms to 500 kilograms, targeting growing demand from satellite megaconstellations.

Asked whether Astra‚Äôs vertically integrated strategy could lead to acquisitions outside of rockets and spacecraft, Kemp said: ‚ÄúAre we going to start laying fiber-optic cables under the ocean? I don‚Äôt see that coming. I think there are some great companies that have done that.

‚ÄúI think that, in terms of building the infrastructure in space, vertically integrating that and building that is where Astra‚Äôs focus is, and so I think we‚Äôll certainly look to partnerships on the ground with the leaders in the infrastructure needed to support what‚Äôs happening in space on the ground.‚Äù

Unlike launch providers SpaceX, Blue Origin and Rocket Lab, Kemp said Astra will not develop systems capable of human spaceflight, saying this enables it to optimize technology for applications closer to Earth.

Astra also disclosed that it has a roadmap to develop larger vehicles, with the goal of placing up to 500 kilograms into orbit. The company did not disclose technical details of that roadmap, or a schedule for producing those larger vehicles.

&#x200B;

Kemp said plans for various mega constellations influenced that roadmap. ‚ÄúWe want to converge with what these mega constellation operators are designing and flying in 2023,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about being the most responsive launch service provider and also being the best way for us to build our own platform.‚Äù

He described an iterative process for gradually scaling up the company‚Äôs launch vehicles to achieve that 500-kilogram target. ‚ÄúMy goal is to have as many iterations as possible, where the engineers can add these things incrementally,‚Äù he said, gradually increasing performance instead of making a big jump from 50 to 500 kilograms.

Astra is a company with intriguing potential to be profitable, in a sector which has proven to be a difficult one from this perspective. CEO Chris Kemp has stated the company‚Äôs focus is on gaining efficiencies. And its attempt to build cheaper, better rockets could prove to be a win for shareholders, as well as humanity, over the long run.

Accordingly, it appears investors are largely viewing ASTR stock as a long-term holding right now. This merger provides Astra with approximately $500 million in new capital. The company plans to build out its production of smaller rockets, hoping to get its price point below the current $2.5 million. Additionally, the company sees opportunities to grow its spacecraft and spaceport business lines. For long-term investors bullish on space-related stocks, this is music to the ears.

As far as space-related stocks go, ASTR stock is one to keep on the radar for now. This company could see some serious buying pressure, if tailwinds persist in this space."

2021-07-03 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Did I do it right? - $WISH Covered Calls Ok, so I have never done anything with options, but I am approved on Fidelity for Level 1: Covered Call Writing, Buy-Writes.

I own 100 shares of $WISH (average cost $11.51). I sold 1 Call for July 9 at a strike price of $18. I got paid $15 (less a small commission). So if my option gets exercised, I have to hand over my 100 shares and I will be paid $18 per share ($1800). If my option doesn't get exercised, I keep my shares and the $15. My only risk is that $WISH goes above $18 and I will miss out on what I could have made if I just kept my shares and sold them at whatever the price was then?

Am I doing this right?"
2021-07-03 03:37:47,wallstreetbets,"First of all, learn to make a risk/reward graph for options. There's a downside advantage here: You actually just lowered your breakeven. The stock can now fall further without you taking a loss. A lot of people view options primarily as a means of moving your breakeven, rather than seeing them as income. (IE, If a trade is going bad, you can sell a covered call and move your breakeven down to ""fix"" it.) The fact that they're limiting upside profit is a secondary concern. Just a perspective to bear in mind.

Other than that, yes, you've got it right.

Be aware that some people favor movies like this because they prefer greater odds of profit to lower odds of greater profit. Not saying which is right or wrong, it's just two different philosophies.

Personally, my idea is, don't FOMO. Don't worry about not making ""enough"" profit. The main job isn't to make money, it's to not lose money.  So any profit is a good profit. You can go broke worrying that you're not wringing every penny of possible profit. Remember Warren Buffet said, ""I leave the top and bottom 10% for someone else."" (Not really about options, but the attitude is relevant.)

So, if it was me, and I got the call exercised and had to sell at $18, for a net profit of about $650, roughly 70% ROI on the original purchase price, I would be entirely content.

Now, in reality, I do sell a lot of covered calls, and if I own the stock, it's because I probably think it's a long-term winner, so I'm using covered calls to bring in a little cash along the way, but I'd rather make less on the CCs and hold the stock longer.  So I do try to choose strikes I think won't get hit. But in any case they're always set so if my shares get called away, the overall trade still ends in profit. That's always good enough. I sell a lot of covered calls at strikes $1 over my cost basis, if the current price is pretty far below it.

And remember, if your shares get called away, you can strategically sell puts to either bring in more income or, worst case scenario, buy it back at a better price. Rinse and repeat.

Also, this is all ignoring the fact that you don't have to hold to expiry. You can close early, roll it out, whatever. Watch the option value and buy to close if before it moves too far against you. You can do risk management on options, too."
2021-07-02 21:54:03,wallstreetbets,"My guy at Etrade called me to explain covered calls when I opened my Roth. He told me don't write covered calls on stocks you love, since there is a risk you will loose it. He suggested I write the covered call with a strike price that I'm OK with selling.  Stupid me shoulda listened better because I wrote $135 calls for my AAPL expiring today and had to buy it back before assignment for $560 :(  

Pain is a good teaching tool.

As far as WISH - my position -  Wish July 16 $15 Call.  Won't make me rich if it gets assigned but I'm here to make money and move on to the next play."
2021-07-03 05:04:29,wallstreetbets,"Right, in principle by choosing weekly. You could consider optimising your strategy, and selling CC at the lower strike, for a better premium."
2021-07-02 20:35:13,wallstreetbets,Goodjob. You keep $15 no matter what happens. Ideally you want it to close at $17.99 for the perfect scenario or really under $18 but obviously not too low.
2021-07-02 22:49:24,wallstreetbets,Or....you could've just done a $10 put and made some real easy money....
2021-07-03 18:06:56,wallstreetbets,"Do you think the stock is worth $18? If so, then sell the covered call. 

If you think it's worth more than $18, what is the point? You're just giving away money."
2021-07-02 23:41:56,wallstreetbets,"Selling a covered call is a bearish play. So, if you think the stock is not going lower than it is now, you‚Äôre doing it wrong. Sell a covered call when you expect the price to retreat, correct, tank whatever you want to call it. Don‚Äôt sell a covered call when you think the price is going up - that is shooting yourself in the foot. Think of selling a covered call as a hedge against the underlying. So when the price goes down, you make a little money to balance out the value you‚Äôre loosing in your underlying. 

The bullish version of this trade is selling a cash covered Put."

2021-07-03 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Here's why CLNE is ready to run starting next week based on technicals Originally posted in [r/CLNE](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLNE/).

I  got into CLNE about a month back as it turned up from the recent lows in $7-8 range. What grabbed me was the weekly pattern based on elliott  waves and other technical indicators.

[Weekly turned up in June](https://preview.redd.it/mra6ek6dxt871.png?width=1478&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a8c9b039d3c66b2e05a53ab437d68489a848304)

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/WeSm5HuF/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/WeSm5HuF/)

The  arrows indicate where the RSI, MACD and Stochastics all turned up and  indicated a nice entry point for the intermediate weekly term.

Next, we would look for confirmation of the trend with a higher price move and a higher low which we are now holding. Moving to the daily time frame, we can look for a nice low risk entry. Well, we're just about there.

[Daily pulled back to support and oversold levels](https://preview.redd.it/uluumatext871.png?width=1478&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbe9b20ece7d0460a3e57d5e9d6fc8780a66b1c5)

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/dJ4c0Mjn/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/dJ4c0Mjn/)

The trendline connecting the prior 2 lows is now in range and we should look for this to hold up, today's price at \~$9.46. MACD is above the zero line (bullish), Stochastics is oversold and looking to rise, and  RSI has pulled back to the 50 range, a typical pullback/turning area.

Ok, so what about these mysterious elliott waves people like to throw around? Well, I'll keep it short and sweet. A bullish EW pattern moves in 5 waves - up-down-up-down-up. and a correction in those down waves are 3 waves - down-up-down. CLNE shows a very clear 4 waves in the bullish direction as indicated on the chart. I'm not bothering labeling all the smaller waves just to keep it simple.

[Projected target area is at new high for 2021 and approaches resistance at 2012 ATH](https://preview.redd.it/cmwbhyjgxt871.png?width=1478&format=png&auto=webp&s=c541ab5fa46dd57f071a4a44bf2721765f2e0c5c)

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/0KgrdeYJ/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/0KgrdeYJ/)

Ok, and what are those 2 red lines, blue box, and green highlighted area? Well, based on the prior trend, we can project both price and time, although, honestly, I don't put a lot of faith in the time projection. More so price in which wave 5 is a projected 1:1 length of wave 1, and I also added 1:1 of those waves in time, and 1:1 price of wave 3 to 5 with a .618 projected in time. This is the highest probability target area which puts us at a **target $24.88-$26.22 by September**. BTW - this puts us at the all time high of $24.75 from March 2012 which can be assumed to be long term resistance.

Now, if we decide to take this entry, we need to decide when we're wrong. Given the approaching trendline, that is the first battle line. If it  doesn't hold, that would be a strong message we're not gaining support for our hypothesis, so below $9.46 is big warning #1. The next support would be the low at $7.48, so depending on how loose you want to play  it, you could also let things play out from there. For a low risk/high reward, I would look at $9.25 to stop out and reassess to look for an entry after that since wave 4 may have longer to complete.

***TLDR: CLNE bullish pattern and indicators present a low risk entry with an upside target of $24.88-$26.22 by September. Correction wave 4 is assumed complete and bull wave 5 is in progress to new highs.***

With everything trading sideways for the last two months I believe we are due for some heavy volatility very soon.

Box, Inc. has been on slow and steady climb since the beginning of this year. Starting out 2021 just below $18 at 17.81 and since then it has reached highs of $27 as of today. Some of the initial spikes in spring were due to buy-out rumors, but Box squashed those and it declined slightly only to continue to rise on real growth due to the financial moves and acquisitions the company has made this year. 

The historical high for BOX was a handful of years ago when it teased with $29 but that was mostly on a prestigious analyst/VC mentioning them as a stock he liked long term. Then it fizzled down to the teens before hitting a COVID low in March 2020. Since that single digit price of $9 in 3/2020 it has only climbed and has become a serious threat to Amazon and Google for cloud content providers. Box has 67% of Fortune 500 companies as customers, departments of the US government, and multiple sports leagues. 

Like I said, it may not be a quick gainer, but the steady growth of the company is encouraging for future $$$.

\- Ocugen was originally an gene therapy company focused to cure blindness

&#x200B;

**Okay cool, we already have enough vaccines so what?**

\- Ocugen is clearly on Dr. Fauci's radar. [Recently Fauci-led NIAID funded Covaxin's efficacy booster adjuvant](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/fauci-led-niaid-funded-covaxins-efficacy-booster-adjuvant-us-nih/articleshow/84011896.cms).

\- [Covaxin effectively neutralises delta variant](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/indias-covaxin-effectively-neutralises-delta-variant-of-covid-says-nih/article35047706.ece)

\- Ocugen recently took a major hit as they were [recommended by the FDA](https://www.biospace.com/article/ocugen-faces-major-slow-down-for-covid-19-vaccine-as-fda-recommends-bla-/) to pursue full approval instead.

\- Ever since June 10th shorties has been having their day making bank off shorting Ocugen.

\- [WHO has already approved shitty Chinese Covid-19 vaccines](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/05/1091542) which is also an inactived virus with lower efficacy as compared to Covaxin. This is almost a guaranteed that Ocugen will get WHO approval within the next few months. You will almost for certain make money with this play.

**Potential catalyst in the coming weeks:**

\- FDA BLA application/approval

\- Canada EUA application/approval

These people are all uneducated retards since they obviously never attended school since they live in a world where they think they can be unvaccinated and not be denied access to places.  Funny how none of them had the same qualms sending their kids to school with updated shot records.  But yeah the dangerous MRNA vaccine with all it's terrible side effects will kill them but willingly going to get a MMR vaccine which is half vaccine half biopsy is perfectly a ok.

2021-07-02 21:35:26,wallstreetbets,"Their cars not being available globally yet doesn't have anything to do with pace of innovation? For instance, Tesla can't sell their cars in Texas currently, that's a regulatory issues. For other regions it's a matter of not having production capacity currently to deliver cars there yet.

Car manufacturing also isn't just a matter of ""alright we've designed the car, now lets go make it and never change update and improve on it""

Tesla have been continuously updating their manufacturing lines and components that go into the cars. Stuff like the octovalve and giga presses are good examples of this"

So Tesla is not a comparable company.

SPCE has no product. It is not selling anything on any market. It has no revenue, because it is not selling anything. It can never have a profit, because to have a profit, you'd have to have some revenue to offset your expenses."

 Government will hire employees to oversee projects. Then hire construction management firms, then a general contractor.

Also this was just a high level example. 

2nd because of the lack of cars needing the service vs the capacity of the service, in the beginning it would make sense to focus the installation of these in population dense environments like major cities and roads between major cities in order to get the most bang for your buck and improve air quality for the most number of people quickly"
2021-07-03 10:46:05,wallstreetbets," Sure but you can‚Äôt build all the charging stations for all the future demand today.

2021-07-03 10:48:44,wallstreetbets,"Right - so the average gas pump can serve up to 1700 cars a day, it‚Äôs only utilized at 100 cars a day because there isn‚Äôt sufficient demand to keep them fully utilized. If you assume it takes 30 minutes to give a reasonable charge to a car. A fully utilized charger with current technology will be roughly 48 cars a day. So cool maybe it‚Äôs 33 million cars of capacity - vs 1.8 million cars in the market‚Ä¶still a great amount of capacity"
2021-07-03 10:53:24,wallstreetbets,"THIS! 
The entire grid in America is old and poorly maintained. We need to connect the entire US power grid together and build more clean power generation before we can support a population full of EV cars. 

This is probably why the charging station funding isn‚Äôt as high as people hoped, we can‚Äôt support it in our current grid"
2021-07-03 03:55:58,wallstreetbets,Thanks for clarifying. I should've realised that. It seems weird that the they could just pocketed the money like that.

2021-07-02 20:57:38,wallstreetbets,"You are absolutely right about bay area mentality and I am guilty too. I live in bay area and work for a major tech company.

But your point about California taking away 10% of people, and young engineers making 400k will change.
I used to work for a medical device startup before I switched to a FAANG company and I was feeling so bad for the people at the startup. They genuinely believe in their company and are working hard to bring that technology to the world and help people. They are all so talented but are taking a significant pay cut to work on this ground breaking medical tech. The startup is bleeding millions a month trying to compete with other tech companies in the area, if the same startup was in say austin, they could reduce their burn rate by half and it would make it so much less stressful for everyone. The CEO finally decided covid was the last straw and is relocating most people to texas. Many willingly took the offer. They were paying senior engineers 180k in bay area (same engineers could make north of 300k if they go to a FAANG company). They are now going to get paid 130k in Austin. And the startup saves a ton of money, people can live way better with 130k in austin than 180k in bay area.

Even at major tech companies, facebook is now allowing 100% remote, even global remote. Soon they will encourage people to move out of bay area. Why pay someone 350k in bay area if they are willing to relocate/work remotely from texas or Tennessee or something and are ok with 200k? 
California's free tax gravy train will significantly reduce going forward as remote work becomes the norm. 

60% of people I work with are willing to take a 20-30% pay cut if it means they can work remotely from say Utah/Arizona or even cheaper parts of California. Compared to making 300k in bay area, they can live like kings in Utah/Arizona with 200k. The initial inertia is partly because how young workforce is at these tech companies. As these companies start to age (average age of google employees went from 27 to 32 in the last few years), priorities will change and people will realize sometimes it is not worth living in bay area if it means you have to work 60-70 hours a week at a major tech company to be able to afford to do it."

2021-07-03 12:13:49,wallstreetbets,"In the future all vehicles will be EV  
There will be as many vehicles in total then as now, at least  
So in time all pumps will be replaced by charging posts  
At present it takes 5 mins to fill your vehicle tank with fluid  
It takes 20-40 minutes to refill your EV battery with charge

So in the future, when all vehicles are EV, you will wait 4+ times longer to refill than at present, or there must be considerably more charging posts available in service stations, than there are pumps at present.

Obviously the change from requirement for fuel pumps to requirement for  electrical charging posts will be gradual, and depends on the rate of takeup of EV, and that itself depends on MANY factors, including some not yet known.

But it is generally accepted now that all vehicles will be 100% EV, in the real and not far distant future.

The companies and real estate owners who administer existing vehicle services across the USA will have some important input in these ongoing decisions.  They are already working out the areas and percentagesserviced by eeach one of their stations across the USA, and projecting the likelihood of EV use by sector and area. 

This is not only regionally financially important to these operations, it is ATM a  complex costing exercise. It is particularly important in cities, where most vehicle owners do not  have access to closed private garages providing any possibility of secure overnight charging."

Why are there  NEARLY always too many pumps in a gas station? .. you must have noticed?.. do you ever think why the company who run the gas station have put in on average three or perhaps five **times** more pumps than you normally see in use? Maybe to *waste money*?

Depends what time you go through that gas station yourself, dont it? But do you avoid it when it's likely to be overcrowded or tailed-back (lot of folk must avoid it when that starts to happen?) What's the max queuing time you would accept? Are you much different from other drivers in that tolerance level?

If your **48** EVs all turn up together at **one** charging post, Monday morning, **35mins before they are due at the office**.. what is the AVERAGE time that a driver will arrive at his work desk  **on** **that day**, You tell me one wont arrive until the end of the day, but you don't say if you mean 'working-hour-day' or 24 hours later? - So what's the average arrival at work hour, all starting at the one post at the same time?<make life easy on yourself we will ignore drive time from charge to work>

The elevator problem :  
In a 12 floor building with two elevators, at which floors should the cabins wait when not called, so that people using the elevators have the shortest average waiting-time when they call an elevator? If it already going down when they call they don't take it if they want to go up, unless it is empty at their floor.  Assume in the morning folk are arriving in the building and in the evening they are leaving the building, but interim traffic is even between floors."
2021-07-02 22:00:22,wallstreetbets,"I mostly agree with you. I went full remote too before COVID. Theres a lot more wrong with BA/CA than just the COL. CA is realizing they fucked up and might have to deal with declining revenues for the first time in history. Why else are they pushing for taxing people who are leaving the state.

However I wouldn't say its a sure thing that BA TC will change much. 
To startups, even more importantly than burn is raising money. BA still has all the VCs, and that is the one factor I don't see changing through anything. Most founders will still end up having to maintain some presence in BA. 
FAANG and unicorns don't worry about money. Their scalability is limited by the amount of employees they can hire, rather than the amount they pay. They make a multiple on every employee they hire, so its no biggie to pay 1.5x more for an employee that will make 5x what they cost. And its not like FAANG was exclusively in BA before COVID either. There were offices all around the US and the world."

2021-07-03 17:43:35,wallstreetbets,"Are you nuts? DiDi has 15 million drivers. In comparison, Uber gives 15 million rides in a day. 

DiDi also didn't give up on AI like Uber did, is beefing up its taxi service and is actually profitable."
2021-07-03 10:49:16,wallstreetbets,"Haha all good, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he did say what you‚Äôre saying at some point! I just remember this specific one because it was soooo misleading for anyone listening"
2021-07-03 18:46:24,wallstreetbets,"What AI? I'm an ML eng and I was offered a job at a ride hailing company this week. What part of their product you think is driven my AI? Or can potentially be driven?

Not berating just trying to have an honest discussion. It's easy for ppl to throw such terms around and have no idea what they're talking about.

AI is not a differentiator for any of these companies. Self-driving tech is going to be developed externally and commoditized so fast once the legal framework is there, that it will make no difference re accessibility.

What's important is how profitable these companies can be as soon as we make the switch."
2021-07-03 19:21:53,wallstreetbets,"Self driving cars. Lmao. 

Do your  research. DiDi piloted a program to track the traffic lights in a 3rd tier city and managed to reduce traffic there by 20% through their algorithms. 

Uber uses the accelerometers to track if users are speeding, and that's pretty much it. 

I'd take DiDi over Uber any day. Don't give a fuck about what a bunch of china scaremongerers have to say, I like a discount."
2021-07-03 19:41:43,wallstreetbets,"Lol I'm not pumping Uber relax. I don't have positions open in this space.

I just think the self-driving hype is misinformed. It all sits behind a thicc layer of legislation and there's a lot of money to be made. People underestimate a) how political this is going to get, think the EU or US not licensing DiDi's tech as road-legal and b) that anyone can spin off a wannabe self-driving startup, hell it'll take me a couple of hours to spin up a CV model, do some custom training and tweaking call it proprietary and advertise it as the next big thing, is it going to be road-worthy, any good etc? Absolutely not. 

Everyone is doing self-driving tech R&D now, how many of these guys you think will actually make the cut? When the tech is mature enough, which it is not at the moment, a few big guys will be given the legal headstart and proceed to dominate. The rest will simply shut down the cash burning R&D departments."
2021-07-03 19:57:30,wallstreetbets,"The China market is really fucking huge. And they have already shown they have very close ties with regulatory and municipal agencies. Much more so than companies pursuing the tech in the US.

I don't know how much you know about DiDi but they are the biggest player in town. Their moat is huge. And they are already profitable."

Step 3. Robinhood takes YOUR SHARE AND SHORTS IT AGAINST YOU SO THE MORE YOU BUY, THE LOWER IT WILL GO. 

Step 4. You panic sell, and ROBINHOOD JUST ROBBED YOUR ASS.

Step 5. You are a bag holder but you just saw that WHKS was trending on WSB, so you cash out your 401k and log on to RH and drop it into WHKS. Next week, you then post ""WHY did WHKS drop 16%""? Answer is you bought shares on Robinhood and they used them to fuck you in the ass."

2021-07-03 11:44:27,wallstreetbets,"18% is absolutely a normal amount for a stock that has been so volatile. There are half a dozen stocks that get mentioned on here daily that are more likely to short squeeze. Yes, I'm saying there's no chance for a further squeeze. The ""squeeze"" was from 10-70 and anybody thinking it's going to triple in value from here is delusional and ""thinking"" with their confirmation bias. Obligatory ""I'm not a financial advisor."" Honestly I'm just so tired of reading the word squeeze on this subreddit. Everybody is brainwashed into believing their meme stock of choice is going to ""squeeze"" and skyrocket thousands of percent. It's insanely annoying and ridiculous. GME was a black swan event that happened because well over 100% of the stock was shorted, which was insane and a huge mistake by the hedge funds that lost their ass. They learned from that and we were fortunate to be able to get AMC to run up this high. We've seen the peak imo."

2021-07-03 16:08:34,wallstreetbets,"I mean, it can, but is certainly a high probability trade...

I'm just getting concerned with how well this channel and 100 SMA has held.

100 SMA tested and held 6 times in the last 12 months. Although since April, the 50 SMA seems to have taken over as support (tested and held well twice) accelerating the price channel and trend."

2021-07-03 16:13:52,wallstreetbets,"Max profit if it does, but yeah, I hear you. I don't always cover all of my LEAPS either. I tend to leg into everything.

Went pretty heavy on CCs when WSB first picked up CLF a couple weeks ago. Peaked that afternoon (Wednesday I think, and I sold $30 7/18 calls IIRC, for $1.65, closed Friday afternoon or Monday morning I think for 50% profit due to IV crush.

If I got called away at $30 on my LEAPS, I'd have been perfectly happy as that would be very near my current fair value price target.

Have 7/18 $26 calls currently open on ~20% of my position and they are +33%, likely rolling up and out on Tuesday."

2021-07-02 22:27:40,wallstreetbets,"Excuse me? It‚Äôs simple math:

(Original value - New value) / (original value)
This gives you a decimal and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. 

(-100 - 100) / (-100) = 2 x100 = 200%

Or, according to your previous comment, it should be infinite? Lol

2021-07-03 17:04:10,wallstreetbets,"> half the time people make it sound like they're a scam ...

There are a lot of ETF's that are just that. I remember one ETF that continues to be based on the LIBOR rate (remember that scandal?). Clear events that should have driven the price up kept it going sideways and sometimes inversely affected the price ironically.

Some warning signs in the prospectuses might be limited information, delayed updates, conflicts of interest to name a few. Certainly not all inclusive. ETF's need far more DD than regular equities imo.

2021-07-03 17:07:48,wallstreetbets,"Well that's all very understandable when considering that raising interest rates would drastically impact their own debt service which is already unsustainable and isn't factoring in unfunded debts like pensions (i.e. Debt to GDP).

The main problem for the politicians is what happens when people's disposable income can't match the prices for mandatory things like food, water, shelter. We've already seen the cost of basic meat and eggs increase by almost 100% in certain places (~ 1$/per pound/dozen).

I like how you multiplied the yearly gym subscription cost by TWO so that you could say ONE person would save $600/year. What if they had FOUR people in their house? Or SIX? There's almost no limit to the savings! And their rent could be split six ways, too. 

It costs more for a singular person to buy a Peloton and maintain a subscription than the average gym membership's price (not to mention the wide array of additional equipment available at the gym for no added price). Adding in extra people to your math to show a higher combined cost with the gym subscription while dividing out the Peloton so you can show it as an averaged cost is just manipulation. I'm not saying home fitness, machines, and subscriptions don't have their place. I'm just saying make sure your math doesn't come off as pandering (and double-check figures before posting)."

He thought there were only two things that can happen when trading ""spreads"" but he found out about a third. That third thing was the one that cost people big bucks. Now I know why the market often takes a down turn just before the close on Fridays.

The second thing I saw was him saying don't listen to the day trading hype on a certain web site. He said only 1% of option traders make money so don't listen to the B.S. Thank you for not bull shitting me, you are OK in my book. 

I then thought of playing online poker where only 12% make money because of the ""rake"". 
At least the sites publish what they take from every pot so one knows what the odds are. 12% of poker players verses 1% of options traders making money is a big difference, though both are not good odds. In poker when you sit down at the table if you don't see the sucker you are it. This video is on his front page.

2021-07-03 18:50:21,stocks,"I would be careful about TSLA as a long-term play right now for 3 reasons:

1) it‚Äôs fairly unclear if Tesla will be able to retain their lead in EV. Many other automakers are entering EV. For instance, Toyota claims to have game-changing solid-state battery tech in the works. If this is true, then Toyota could potentially be the leader in EV (especially if you combine game-changing tech with their already-stellar reputation and market share). Or maybe some other car company. Who knows?
2) Tesla is currently very expensive. At a valuation of 600B, Tesla‚Äôs current price tag is on par with the largest, most successful, and highest-profit companies in the world. To buy now means you expect them long-term to continue going up on top of this already-massive valuation. Possible, but definitely risky (especially for a company that is very new, has relatively low profits, and isn‚Äôt very diversified).
3) currently, tesla‚Äôs valuation relies a lot on expectation of future earnings (nothing wrong with that; I like this style of investing). If the overall market takes a significant downturn before tesla can become very profitable, then their stock price will probably plummet (once the stock price goes down, people/institutions on margin need to sell, causing the price to go even lower, causing a cycle the way down; speculative stocks tend to get hit worst when this happens). Could be similar to Cisco circa 2000. Note that if this does happen, this might actually be a good time to buy shares for cheap if you do still believe in the long-term for tesla

These are just my thoughts. Not financial advice. I personally own put options on tesla (but also own shares of tesla in an account that someone else manages for me)"

2021-07-03 17:14:31,stocks,"Do your own research.  That said, some good sources both bad and good news is in Tesla Daily/Rob Maurer YouTube channel and teslarati website. Legacy auto is dying because they choose to do so. Tesla should outsell Ford in 2023 to 2024 time frame and then quickly take over other OEMs. All these companies are throwing 10s of billions at EVs and have almost nothing to show for it. In the meantime Tesla is now on its 3rd custom factory and is starting it's own battery mining to cell production. Too many things to discuss regarding opportunities outside of auto that other companies dont have. Tesla manufacturing is hands down better than any competing company and they dont have the overhead of pensions, ads, dividends, legacy overhead costs eating into revenue.

They own a lot of windfarms in Texas which is basically printing them money and Texas has an isolated power grid so they kind of have a lot of pricing power.  Then I bought QCLN to invest in clean energy in a broader sense in case I'm wrong about NEE.  Also own some NIO, TSLA, YOLO & KARS.  For example YOLO is the marijuana etf, which owns primarily VFF but also owns 4% of its portfolio weighted in CURLF.  If the fed ever legalizes pot on a national level, which I think it will soon, then YOLO should see big gains.  That's really the only reason it would become a good investment and if I'm wrong about legalization then I chose a bad investment."
2021-07-03 16:58:23,stocks,"It depends on the premium you pay and the amount that the stock goes up/down. 

Say you have $10,000 to invest in the stock or option and the volatility is 40% and there is no dividend and you hold the option until expiration day when you sell it for intrinsic value. You can either buy 100 shares or 5 options contracts for the $100 strike and 2023 expiration at ~$20 per contract.

Fast forward to 2023. If the stock is now $120, you made $2000 profit if you bought the stock but $0 profit if you bought the options. If the stock is $125, you made $2500 by both strategies. If the stock is $130, you made $3000 buying the stock vs. $5000 buying the option. If $100, you broke even on the stock and lost $10000 on the options."

2021-07-03 18:46:10,stocks,"Learn your Greeks.  Your delta will tell you how many shares you are synthetically holding.  This number will go up as stock price gets further ITM of your strike or go down as stock price gets further OTM of your strike.  Also understand theta, your option is a decaying asset unlike a stock.  Your theta will be highest ATM.  The further ITM or further OTM, the lower your theta decay.  This is why LEAPS are usually bought deep in the money. Your option delta will be close to 1 (I try to buy at least .8) and theta decay will be lower than one that is close to or at the money.  

I own more leaps than I probably should but they have been working out for me. I have heard people say no more than 10% of your portfolio but it‚Äôs all about your comfort level. I recommend having an exit strategy as well.  This could be based on a target price, profit % or by a certain date.  Also make sure you are buying an underlying with high volume.  You want a decent amount of liquidity in your LEAP in case you need to get out fast.  Check bid/ ask spreads."

If you use them to express a bad idea, it‚Äôs always risky. Selling calls on GME before wsb got involved is an example of how options can ruin you, but shorting GME stock wouldn‚Äôt have been pleasant either. On the other hand buying puts on GME would‚Äôve been bad, but in a controlled way. Only the premium paid would be lost. Both options and stocks can be used together to control risk and exposure.

Options are just a tool and it depends how you use them whether it's gambling. Definitely agree that if you don't know then it's super easy to fuck yourself though."
2021-07-03 18:57:13,stocks,"When I said flash forward to 2023, I meant the day the option expires in 2023 (OP didn‚Äôt specify which date so neither did I).

2021-07-03 19:16:51,stocks,">I don‚Äôt understand this comment. If you think it will go up and fine with risk, option is the way to go.

Because there are so many ways to lose money with options. Theta decay means your options lose value every day. Expiration date means that you lose the option entirely once it passes. Finally there is IV crush. If the IV contracts, you will lose most if not all of the extrinsic value of the option. 

Meanwhile shares do not have any of these risks."
2021-07-03 17:00:27,stocks,"Delta for options is always smaller than 1. For example, let‚Äôs say the delta for a call is 0.6. This means that if the share price rises $1, the call would increase by roughly 0.60 or $60, whereas 100 shares would increase by $100. 

The only reason to buy a call instead of 100 shares is if you cannot afford the shares in the first place."
2021-07-03 16:52:11,stocks,Its more the simple math of it and the fact that 100 shares losing 1.00 dollar on the price of the stock isn't nearly as detrimental. There are also things you can do with 100 shares like creates calls or put contracts. Im sure there is more to it then this though.
2021-07-03 18:58:17,stocks,What about the IV at sell bro
2021-07-03 19:59:33,stocks,"Actually, you're right. That is probably the main risk of long-term LEAPS options compared to owning shares: realized losses when rolling contacts. Unless you roll into an option that's more out-of-the-money to compensate for the prior option's drop in value.

Also note, if you've been studious about selling monthly or weekly short calls against your long-term calls regularly, that will most likely offset any loss in value of said long-term call."
2021-07-03 19:58:44,stocks,"Yes, but realized losses aren‚Äôt much worse than unrealized losses; in fact they help with taxes. The real problem with call options instead of stocks is that you‚Äôre giving up value below the strike price at expiration. If you‚Äôre okay with that they provide more leverage. Stocks are better in most other ways including dividends and long term capital gain flexibility."
2021-07-03 17:51:54,stocks,"They are not necessarily leveraged. Buying a call is the same as buying 100 shares and buying a put at the same price. You CAN leverage more by buying calls but if you have a ton of money, calls are just a safer way to invest in a stock than stock is (you are exposed to all the upside of a stock, but can only use the value of the call and no more if the stock falls)"
2021-07-03 17:09:19,stocks,"In a 0.6 delta scenario, you can probably scoop up 2 options and get 120 delta exposure for less capital than the 100 delta exposure of owning the underlying. 

My bigger point is: there‚Äôs no ‚Äúbetter‚Äù - both are different and can be used for different things. Owning 100 shares is great if you wanna own for 30 years. Buying 100 delta notional in options is great if you want leverage and have a shorter time outlook"
2021-07-03 18:56:22,stocks,If you own the 100 shares sell weekly calls or puts.  That way you profit off your stock more.  Of course this is a larger initial investment but on a volatile stock it can be profitable. Worst case someone buys your 100 shares or you buy back the contract Friday before close. Theta gang üòÇ
2021-07-03 17:00:18,stocks,"but that option leverage though, you can get to 100 delta without such a huge capital outlay"
2021-07-03 19:14:43,stocks,You can sell premium against your options too. It‚Äôs called a calendar spread.
2021-07-03 19:10:56,stocks,He‚Äôs not selling it - he‚Äôs holding to expiry. What don‚Äôt you understand??
2021-07-03 19:04:15,stocks,Does implied volatility still exist at expiry?
2021-07-03 18:29:22,stocks,"It‚Äôs inherently leveraged in the sense that buying $x worth of shares gives you less profit potential than $x worth of call options. However, as you mention, there are strategies with call options that are safer than owning shares. For example, if you wish to control 100 shares, then of course purchasing a single call option would be safer than buying 100 shares outright"
2021-07-03 17:14:28,stocks,"But you know what‚Äôs better than 2 calls and 120 delta? Buying 200 shares and having 200 delta. 

Calls always provide less gains compared to the number of shares they control. If you have limited capital, then sure calls may be  your only option. But otherwise you will always earn more with shares."

2021-07-03 19:12:29,stocks,OP never said that lol
2021-07-03 19:09:14,stocks,Technically yeah but the option will have no extrinsic value from it as there would be no time left for it to have any consequence.

The June 23, 2023 $140 strike is 22.43; Delta 0.5821.

If I buy two of those at $22.43 I am out $4486.

If I buy 100 shares @ $139.89 it cost me $13,989, so I could buy 6 leaps @ $13,458 and potentially make a lot more money selling calls on 6 contracts rather than just holding 100 shares and selling one contract.  And I have $540 extra dollars to throw at hookers and cocaine."
2021-07-03 17:43:35,stocks,"But owning 4 calls and having 240 Delta is better than owning 200 shares, for similar or less capital.

And owning 10 calls and having 600 Delta is better than owning 500 shares, for similar or less capital. And so on.

LEAPS options at the money will always provide greater leverage and exposure than owning the shares themselves, for the same amount of money you have available to invest."
2021-07-03 17:22:02,stocks,">But you know what‚Äôs better than 2 calls and 120 delta? Buying 200 shares and having 200 delta.

Difference in cost between these two positions, using AAPL as an example, would be 200 \* 19.80 = $3,960 (AAPL C135 Sep 22, 124 delta notional), and 200 \* 139.96 = $27,992

So no argument from me that having $30k in capital is better than $4k in capital. But then you gotta think if you really want all that exposure to APPL, instead of leverage exposure.

Not in P&L terms."
2021-07-03 17:11:09,stocks,I expanded in my other comment to you
2021-07-03 17:14:54,stocks,"Yeah totally, I have core holdings in ETFs, but am starting to do more lower-risk options -- slightly ITM calls. Been burnt a few too many times on risky options plays lol"
2021-07-03 19:40:14,stocks,"Yes, yes they did.

""You hold the option to expiration day"""
2021-07-03 19:28:14,stocks,Right but OP never specified if he would let his options expire or if he would close out his contract close to expiry date or at expiry date which in turn could impact the profit
2021-07-03 18:14:27,stocks,"You are missing my point. I am comparing calls with the number of shares they control. If you buy 2 leaps, then those control 200 shares. Likewise, if you are buying 6 leaps, you would be controlling 600 shares. In both cases you would make more money by holding the shares because the delta for a leap is always lower than 1 whereas the delta for 100 shares is equal to 1.

The only reason not to hold shares is because you don't want to allocate that much capital to one company. And there is nothing wrong with that. But you will absolutely make more money if you bought the equivalent number of shares instead of the leaps."
2021-07-03 18:20:15,stocks,"To clarify, I am comparing calls with the number of shares they control. If you buy 4 calls, then those control 400 shares. Likewise, if you are buying 10 calls, you would be controlling 1000 shares. In both cases you would make more money by holding the shares because the delta for a call is always below 1 while the delta for 100 shares is equal to 1.

Yes, the shares require more capital exposure but you WILL make more money holding the shares rather than the leaps."
2021-07-03 18:40:26,stocks,"No argument here either. I thought we were comparing 1 option with 100 shares. You will get more gains with the 100 shares, but yes, you will also have more capital exposure to the company."
2021-07-03 19:41:57,stocks,Do you know what OP means?
2021-07-03 18:41:26,stocks,"I feel like you are missing my point, as I demonstrated that you can hold 6x the shares for the same price in which case, I would make more money than you did in 2 years.

If the price is 140 now 14,000 for 100 shares14,000 for 6 leaps

on june 23 2023 the price is 185 you have 18500 but I have 45 x 6 x 100 or $27000

And you also missed my point about selling calls.  If I sell OTM calls off 6 contracts vs 1 contract, I make 6x the money."
2021-07-03 19:56:50,stocks,"And what you're failing to grasp, is that it's not about the number of shares you own, it's about the total amount of capital invested.

If you had $1000 in long-term calls, versus $1000 in shares, the calls will always provide more leverage/exposure to the stock.

If you had $1 million in calls, versus $1 million in shares, same thing. If you had $1 BILLION in calls, versus $1 billion in shares, same thing.

Calls are ALWAYS superior to shares when it comes to leverage and exposure, if you judge on a dollar-for-dollar basis.

Comparing a call option that costs $1000 to 100 shares that cost $10,000 is apples and oranges. You should be  comparing 10 options (total invested=$10,000) to 100 shares (total invested=$10,000). The latter would be the fair comparison."
2021-07-03 19:57:49,stocks,"That has got to be the weakest, most pedantic and desperate attempt at being right I've ever seen."
2021-07-03 18:50:03,stocks,"Once again, I am comparing 1 leap to 100 shares (or 6 leaps to 600 shares). You are comparing 6 leaps to 100 shares which is a different scenario. Your analysis is not wrong but we are talking about different things here."
2021-07-03 19:58:53,stocks,Nice
2021-07-03 19:03:22,stocks,"Okay but I am just saying that *for the same capital* of 100 shares (not a bad investment, btw) you can control 600 shares with leaps.

With control of 600 shares I can sell ""Out of The Money"" call options to lower my cost basis along the 2 years faster than with 100 shares.

For example, I looked up the July 30 Option's chain and I could sell a $143 for $2.47.  If I owned 100 shares, I could sell one call and pocket $247.  I could use that to lower the cost basis which is $13989.  But with LEAPs, I could sell 6 of them for a credit of $1482.  In both cases, I may close the position out early to reduce risk (buy to close) but the cost basis of the 100 shares is $13742, and my leaps are now $11976.

You can do this every month, so the potential of profit is *significantly* higher on the leaps vs the shares *for* *~~the exact same~~* *LESS cost basis*."
2021-07-03 19:23:03,stocks,"You need to have 600 shares to sell your 6 leaps, unless you‚Äôre selling naked calls on margin."
2021-07-03 19:08:15,stocks,No argument here. If you have a fixed capital exposure then yes you can make more money with leaps. However if we are comparing leaps and shares in a ratio of 1 leap to 100 shares then the shares would make you more money.
2021-07-03 19:32:35,stocks,If you have 6 LEAPs that is sufficient collateral for selling calls.  I thought naked calls were selling without enough shares collateral?
2021-07-03 19:22:09,stocks,"I‚Äôm sure his point is you control more shares with the premium with no intention of exercising them.

It‚Äôs cheaper to buy calls rather than shares and you get ‚Äúmore‚Äù shares if hopefully the stock price rises and the IV gets a nice juicy pump.

2021-07-03 18:10:19,stocks,"If that is your only exposure to the US, I would not move it. If I was an international investor, I would at least keep some of my money denominated in the dollar, whether through US equities or other securities that benefit from a stronger dollar. The reason for this is because during a recession or stock crash that can materially impact your finances, with the US being the reserve currency for the world, the US dollar becomes stronger so any asset denominated in the dollar is worth more relative to other currencies. For example in 08, USD to GBP was 0.5 and increased to 0.72 at the height of the crisis. If you owned an asset denominated in the dollar, it would have higher value than if you had owned it in GBP, since the dollar was worth much more compared to before the crisis. For US investors, as another example, VTI in US dollars outperformed VEU (all-world ex-US) even when the crisis *happened in the US*, the rise in the dollar completely crashed world equities in dollar terms."

I'm impressed by all gurus we're having on reddit suddenly, I've never seen a stock that can't drop lower then $31. Heck, even Apple has tested real lows if you go back far enoug. Corsair is a decent enough brand though not unique or hyped among  us hardware enthusiasts and PC part pickers/PC builders. I see it pumped here by traders not by PC builders.

You being a PC builder sadly has no implications on what the company CRSR is worth nor its stock price. While you may be correct in stating that this stock can drop below $31, you're wrong in assuming that the stock is being pumped by people who are idiots. Perhaps you should reassess the situation, you may know what you're talking about when it comes to building PC's but clearly know nothing about why stocks hold value."

When NVDA‚Äôs stock needs to take a break, I find it likely investors will rotate their investments into $AMD which is yet to have a spectacular run. Just my opinion"
2021-07-03 19:39:39,stocks,Link? Pretty sure Nvidia has highest GPU market share.
2021-07-03 19:44:04,stocks,"I suppose that‚Äôs possible. The thing is, with this 4-1 forward split on NVDA shares, I think the run is going to continue until next earnings. Then, they will likely post another disgustingly strong beat, and it will continue further.

2021-07-03 15:37:18,stocks,"90/10 is fine. I typically have roughly 5% if my portfolio in cash (excluding my emergency fund). 

I usually contribute to my portfolio bi-weekly (a portion of my salary). Depending on the market prices of the portfolio I own, the contributions are usually spent immediately. The only exception is when all my stocks in the portfolio are at a range that are overvalued (without a long winded explanation - I have an excel dashboard that summarizes all my analysis), in which case, the cash will sit in the account. As an example, my portfolio was up to roughly 15% cash in January, but I‚Äôm back down to <5% now. 

Back to the point, 30-40% does seem like a really large portion of your portfolio that could be used in the market rather than sitting on cash. Do you have some sort of plan that you follow (similar to what I do)? ‚ÄúFeeling‚Äù like there will be a market correction isn‚Äôt ‚Äúknowing‚Äù there will be. If you know there will be, then you should be 100% cash. Is this feeling coming from your risk appetite in the stocks you‚Äôre in (you are pretty heavily tech based - at a quick glance)? 

If the market is overvalued in accordance to your plan, then follow your plan, otherwise assess where the feeling of a market correction is coming from. You want to be logical about selling your investments rather than selling based on a feeling."

You don‚Äôt need to pre-pay tax on investment income, and you really can‚Äôt, since it‚Äôs tied up interactively with wage income in the first place. It settles up during tax time.

PTON is damn near a Becky stock at this point and the Starbucks drinking, Target shopping housewives of America are not going to buy the Myx bike to save 30%.

I don't like PTON as a company or stock. They provide an overpriced product that is made incredibly cheap and people are catching on.

My source, I worked in a factory that had a contract to produce the motors for the bike. The factory itself generally produces quality motors BUT the PTON motors were outsourced to a third party in China.  The last time a major contract had their motors outsourced to China from our plant there were major quality control concerns to the point every motor had to be brought back to the American plant. Not an endearing sign for the product here.

You should be careful here. Can you explain why in 2017, QYLD was 22.36 at the start of the year and only gave out 1.77 in ""dividends"" for the whole year? That's only a yield of 7.9%. This is because these aren't actual dividends that come from a company, they are profits from CC options trading. What prevents Nasdaq-100 volatility to come down and the yield to come down from around 12% now to 7.9% again? If you reinvested the yield, you can actually get less and less in dividends per share, and this is to be expected because Nasdaq-100 volatility is still high right now."

2021-07-03 17:26:36,stocks,">I can't explain, but that was four years ago so not really relevant to more recent performance.

Past performance doesn't determine future returns, but you don't think one should understand *why* it underperformed in the past to have any sort of prediction about future returns?

>criticism of QYLD and its brethren always seem to assume it's one's only holding

By that logic, why criticize anything? ""I don't want to listen to bear cases of NKLA because it's only 5% of my portfolio"". Criticism of QYLD being a large percentage a portfolio is because of the criticism of being not diversified. Criticism of QYLD itself includes: a lack of understanding of how it achieves that super high yield, only investing in it because of that high yield, super tax inefficient even compared to other high yield securities, opacity of future performance against past performance and similar investments, automatic use of an active risk management tool for passive yield. All of these are risks of QYLD and not understanding them can lead to long periods of underperformance.

If you want to make a case for it then make a case for it. I can show you some scenarios it can be a good idea, it does outperform a non-CC writing benchmark like QQQ if there is a prolonged bear or flat market in QQQ without much volatility, but that's about the only time when holding QYLD is better than QQQ, so investors should know this risk."

I do plan to re-enter after I see that it‚Äôs recovering in which case the only way I lose is if it drops by 20% then starts recovering by 5% or 10% which means I enter selling low buying high, but that‚Äôs a risk I‚Äôm willing to take to avoid losing 50%-90% in a big market crash."

1 of these statements needs to be false. I refuse to accept a 6 month beginner has any clue about the average behaviour what happened after stop losses! 

How many times even did your stop losses trigger in 6 months, when almost everything went up? How many times the stop loss was the bad decicion? (or are you just talking about meme stocks, where you were too late to the party?)"

2021-07-03 18:51:01,stocks,"Tried different strategies, had stop loses on a lot of trades. Some of the trades weren‚Äôt long term strategies, and had stop loses on them. Overall on average stop loss did save and win me money. 

For example back in Feb I invested in Unity after it dropped to 126$ and set a stop loss at 120$. Unity went on to go down to as far at 70-80$. But i didn‚Äôt lose that much since I got out at 120$. I did also re-enter into Unity at around 83$, but later sold at 89$ cause a better investment opportunity showed up. 

^ this is one example where stop loss did save me a lot. I had stop losses that did lose me money like I had invested in Roblox and set a -10% stop loss cause it was a pretty new stock. it went down by -10% then went up by 20% weeks.

Over the 6 months I‚Äôve been trading. Stop loss saved me more on average than it lost me. I‚Äôm sure if I held longer the price would rise back to its original eventually, but going back to the unity example, the price of unity is still going around 90-110. So I would still have my money locked in the negative for that one if i didn‚Äôt set a stop loss at the beginning."

However, been trading for about 4 years now, and history would say your best bets for large upward swings based off of current events only last 16 months. Right now with the semiconductor shortage, I see SMH and SOXX easily going up 20% in the next 10-12 months. 

Will it do this every 10-12 months going forward? Almost for certain now - but by then another ETF will be ready for a large momentum swing, and trade that one. Rinse and repeat. My prediction would be in 2023/2024 that clean energy will be the next ETF to swing upward, but we will have to see when the time gets closer."
2021-07-03 18:11:19,stocks,I do agree that Microsoft is a great shout. I just prefer it over Google. But that's just me :) A portfolio with either one or both is a great portfolio nonetheless (EDIT: as long as the rest of it isn't trash lol).

2021-07-03 16:41:45,stocks,"Been researching these companies and etfs.  Been invested in NEE for a while.   Provided the current administration doesn‚Äôt screw things up I expect the opening of everything, people getting out etc to spur demand.    Without getting political here, we are currently still enjoying the Trump economy.  Unfortunately Biden has been slowly chipping away at it so the caveat here could be if Biden continues to over regulate to the point where everything slows again like it did under Obama.   I‚Äôm paying close attention to policies being changed.   Corporations have been preparing for this since he became president so that should be an indication to all that there could be a slow down.   I‚Äôm still a bull on energy for the second half of this year though."
2021-07-03 17:08:44,stocks,Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping lol only thing lagging in my portfolio for now
2021-07-03 18:25:57,stocks,That‚Äôs an interesting one.   Because more and more Americans are trying to purchase non Chinese made products.  Even Amazon had to respond to this as people continue to demand products that do not come from China.   I think the twist to all of this is that the Trump administration was having great success removing our manufacturing and supply chain dependency from China.   But if the current administration keeps restarting its over regulation like in the Obama years you‚Äôll see that companies will go back to China.  This will be a huge threat to our security and supply chain if Biden is successful.  Not trying to be political.  It‚Äôs simple math and unfortunately we have the Obama years as an example.

It's not hard - you just wait for years twiddling your thumbs for a crash, try not to be greedy, buy in gradually, wait for a recovery or mania, sell out. But there are probably easier ways of making better returns if you don't mind seeing more volatility on your capital."
2021-07-03 19:47:24,stocks,"Looking at the charts, Tqqq and other leveraged etfs like Udow and Upro can drop like a rock and then take much longer to recover than their non-leveraged counterparts.

2021-07-03 15:05:40,stocks,"It‚Äôll depend on your risk tolerance. S&P ETFs generally have higher returns but a bit more risk since they are heavily weighted in tech. However, based on the sole concept of compounding returns, it doesn‚Äôt matter how you allocate since it‚Äôll grow in the same fundamental way. Your average return just might decrease with further diversification like putting some in an S&P ETF, international, total stock market, bonds, etc. Im the exact same age as you, have a stable job, and I have 70% in equity ETFs (VOO, VT, and VTI), 20% in AGG (bond ETF), and the remaining 10% I put in individual company stock because I enjoy that aspect. I also try and contribute between 800-1000 per month. With a large time horizon to hold, taking that amount of risk is generally okay."
2021-07-03 14:12:57,stocks,"Not sure if this accurate but your goal of 1M depends on your initial amount and how much you plan to put in every month.

If you put 500k and  nothing else then to get to 1M you need 3% gain each year and that will get you to your goal in 29 years.

If you have less money to starts with you would a higher percentage gain. If you put every month and less initially, you might be still be able to do it with a 3% yearly.

In any case - these are my thoughts but they are probably wrong."

Specially if you like buying otm calls/puts

There are some general rules (which can be broken sometimes):

Dont buy calls on green days unless you are sure the price will keep rising. Same with puts, dont buy them on red days.

Usually when volatility is high, options are expensive to buy (that way, its more profitable if you sell them). Example: if you plan to buy a call for a particular stock, sell a put instead.
And the inverse is also true. If there is little to no volatility, its when you should buy contracts instead of selling.

One other thing I'd tell myself if I was starting again is to focus my strategy at 60+ DTE (for buying calls) and selling them between 30-60 DTE to minimize losses to Theta.

for a defined risk stategy some backtesting shows its better to hold till expiry rather than quickly cut losses.

for a loss, dont cut them. you should roll the contract up and out if its a short call/put is tested.

You can chase higher gains and be greedy if you believe you have an edge thats not priced in.

what i think new people should do is....

have most contracts that you are long at least 45 DTE. I average around 90 DTE. I do minimum  of 30 DTE and Max of 100 DTE.

For most contracts i dont buy OTM calls. 

Try to balance your greeks by selling options either in spreads to reduce theta decay of your accounts.

Make sure to close out contracts you are short by expiration so you are not assigned overnight and then carry undefined risk."

1.	Sell options right at the open to get the most theta

3.	Stick to only large caps for options
4.	try to exit according to rule #2
5.	If you are up 25%+ the next day after opening a position, get out. The day after that, 15%+. After that, rule #2 applies. 
6.	Roll out profitable positions, but only if you would be ok entering that position again at that time."

2021-07-03 15:41:14,stocks,"I used to think so, too, but I've found that to somewhat not be the case, if only because people and algos think it to be true and act on it and make the charts play out. I'd say it's more like analyzing the weather with patterns and trends within the larger market and down to a particular stock, all affecting one another. Hardly a science, but an art. 

Try this. Go to ""inchartitrust"" on stockwits. It's just one guy putting out charts. You can't delete any posts on stocktwits. Just go through his. See how many play out as he predicted weeks, months, years ago.

I can't tell you how many times gaps do get filled, cups and handles are clear as day and play out in longer time frames, and charts have played out.

I buy stocks that have great fundamentals and hold, or I swing them, but I see if they've been identified as having good technical setups. 

IBD talks about technical analysis in a constructive way and has for years if not decades. The stockwits account I mentioned is uncannily good. 

Two recent plays I acted on that he backed up: AMD, FSLR. Both up 10-20 percent within the past week and breaking out. PGNY was a play that went parabolic that he highlighted. 

ABT, ABBV, and CRM look to be great long term setups to buy in to right now, from both a technical point of view and fundamentally.

Do *not* go for penny stocks or try to analyze based on the MACD or something on any time frame smaller than the daily (day to day) one. That's like shooting a fish in a barrel

That stockwits account and the adherents of certain schools of technical analysis (Elliot Wave theory, etc.) would say that price action tells the whole story; the narratives just come second and follow from what the stock and market does. It's all patterns, playing out over and over. If you think about this, it kind of is true. Every night, futures move up a bit or down a bit, and stories come out pronto saying it happened on this news or that. In a few hours, the futures change markedly and so does the news. So what determines price action? It's an interesting POV to consider.

Open mind, always."

Look at iv in the weeks approaching an earnings event to get a feel, iv percentile will go from like 5%-30% or higher and u can get a feel for where iv typically sits. If u want to use options on an earnings play get them like a month in advance, 2-3 weeks minimum.

Basically any time the price is fluctuating more than usual or experiences a big gap one direction or the other iv will increase. So it would be ideal to buy options when the price is stable. 

U can take advantage of iv as well, like selling options before earnings and selling the contracts based on the increased iv (no price movement but increased iv increases value of contracts).

I typically try to buy options on low iv, sell options on high iv. If I buy on high iv I‚Äôm assuming there will be a big price movement to make up any decrease in iv.

Also: iv in the first hour and last hour of the day will be higher than mid day, so u can literally buy a contract on a ticker mid day and sell it next morning for a couple dollars profit all things else stay the same and theta decay is minimal."
2021-07-03 16:14:19,stocks,I‚Äôd say IV in general is too high compared to pre-covid times and every contract feels overpriced except like banking sector and etfs.
2021-07-03 16:49:11,stocks,"when IV rank is > 50%.

actually this is a low IV market so 99% of stuff even GME, AMC, is actually low IV territory.

you can buy when IV is high as long as you are vega neutral or positive which would be holding a debit or credit spread till expiry."

 I start to take profits at 10%, if it‚Äôs dropping by 5% my thesis is probably wrong but I watch the price action. 

I think this is where scaling in and out as well as understanding the personality of a stock comes in. Having hard rules can be tricky because it will not apply to all stocks or price action."

You can also get assigned early whenever you sell an option which can really mess up your account if that option was part of a spread. Basically avoid spreads until you‚Äôre really comfortable with options. They‚Äôre a great tool but they come with many pros/cons compared to just a single option."

This is the email I received from DT in response to my email concerning today‚Äôs stock price drop from Brian Bartholomew
Senior Vice President, Capital Markets and Strategy

Hi David-
 
CRAZY day today, to be sure.  The Google policy-shift noise was the source of our weakness today‚Ä¶and was severely misinterpreted by investors today‚Ä¶
 
https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557390/google-apk-app-bundles-package-format-play-store
 
 There are scarier, more (wrongfully-)opinionated versions of the same story floating around out there today, some of which seem to wish to imply that Google is working to effectively remove all other app install sources.  This is UNTRUE ‚Äì we are fully onboard with Google in this ‚Äúbundle‚Äù effort that is rooted in other, more logical incentives.  Most importantly, this has ZERO impact on our business (we fully applaud the movement to app bundles and support app bundles already as part of our platform).
 
There is NO way that our stock should be down on this noise.  
 
 Total madness today.  Speculation led to outright fear.  We fully support Google‚Äôs efforts in this area‚Ä¶just as they fully accept & support our participation in the ecosystem.  Our business is just as fully healthy as it was yesterday‚Ä¶and will ideally continue to be going forward.
 
Have a safe & sane (& fun) weekend.

2021-07-03 00:00:00,stocks,"Vanguard S&S ISA, S&P 500 Question Hey!

 I'm investing in the S&P 500, but Vanguard doesn't allow fractional shares. If I put in ¬£100 and the unit price is ¬£51, ¬£49 is then put into my account as 'cash'. Is there a way of buying units individually as opposed to blindly putting money in? If I try to reinvest the cash, it further dents my yearly ISA allowance. This seems wrong as it's the same money?"
2021-07-03 10:11:20,stocks,"The ""cash"" component within the vanguard ISA account is still within your ISA bubble, it counts the same as a cash isa. So buying and selling funds  using your cash position does not affect your ISA allowance at all.

Also, the vanguard isa is a flexible isa, so any money you withdraw from your ISA back to your normal bank account can them be deposited back in at a later date (within same tax year) without it affecting your ISA allowance.

So you can buy/sell/withdraw as much as you want and it does not affect your allowance at all, until the end of the tax year where obviously you lose the allowance. Any of the money withdrawn flexibly but not replaced in time will count towards the new tax years allowance.

Also, Vanguard specifies either a ¬£500 lump sum or monthly minimum of ¬£100 direct debit to open the account. But once the account is open you can just cancel the direct debit and deposit however much you want to whenever you feel like it. You dont have to put in ¬£100 every month.

 If you want fractional shares then vanguard mutual funds allow those, unfortunately their ETFs do not allow fractionals."

Long run, if you pass the criteria above, I think you should be fine but nobody knows you enough to actually determine that. 

All these factors is what you should consider in terms of your portfolio mix. If you can't afford or stand volatility, then you need to have a larger portion in stable index funds.

2021-07-03 00:00:00,stocks,"ETF‚Äôs are basically tax advantages accounts I love picking stocks like everyone else here. I thought I would phrase why ETFs are the way to go in a way I found compelling. 

If you stock picking, you constantly are realizing gains, even if you are long duration and conservative. 

If you just never sell your ETFs, the fund keeps buying and selling stocks, but you don‚Äôt realize those gains, similar to a 401k. 

Dividends are obviously the exception. You get taxed on those, but those are relatively small typically.

Tax efficiency is one of the main benefit of ETFs, and I found that thinking of it as a tax advantaged account is a compelling framing for understanding this primary benefit.


Edit:
Another way to phase this is that ETFs do not pay taxes because they shift exposure to the underlying stocks with [creation units](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creationunit.asp).

Creation units are at the heart of the tax advantage, and most people don‚Äôt really understand or appreciate it. 

Retail stock pickers cannot play the creation unit game, and therefore are at a relative massive tax disadvantage long term. This is one of the primary reasons why professionals recommend buying and holding ETFs. 

Buying and holding ETFs is similar to tax advantaged accounts because they also have a structural tax advantage. ETFs less so, but still very significant.

I‚Äôm not trying to convince anyone. This is just something I have come to appreciate. I thought phasing it as similar to a tax advantaged account was an interesting framing.

Edit 2:
PSA: I would like to point out that there has been a market trend where ETF creators increasingly take advantage of this positive perception of ETFs and charge a huge fee while the investors think they are doing the smart thing by holding ETFs. Gotta look at the expense ratio and fee structure. Generally if the ETF has a huge amount of assets under management, the fees are ok.

Edit 3:
Jurisdiction specific. Written with the USA in mind."

2021-07-03 07:40:45,stocks,"Unfortunately in Ireland ETFs are taxed very strangely. Gains and distributed dividends are taxed at 41% with no annual exemption and no ability to offset losses against gains. There is also a ‚Äúdeemed disposal‚Äù after holding for 8 years which means you have to pay tax on your unrealised gains. The only advantage is that in UCITS accumulating funds dividends are automatically reinvested without having to pay tax on the dividends. 

In comparison, the CGT on stocks is 33% (no difference between short term and long term). There is an annual exemption of ‚Ç¨1,270 before you pay tax and other capital losses can be offset against gains and no ‚Äúdeemed disposal‚Äù. Dividends are taxed at normal income tax rates (which can be up to 52% at the highest marginal tax rate in Ireland).

2021-07-03 09:05:17,stocks,"""similar to a 401k""

Not similar at all. 

Tax-deferred contributions to your 401k are made pre-tax, so you don't pay income taxes on the part of your salary you use to make contributions. 

Tax-exempt contributions are made post-tax (so you pay tax on the salary you use to make contributions, just like buying ETFs in taxable accts), but you don't pay taxes on capital gains when you withdraw in retirement. 


These two options are what is meant by ""tax-advantaged"" 

Buying an ETF in a taxable acct offers neither of these tax advantages."

2021-07-03 12:07:53,stocks,"In general, i agree with OP. But the important distinction is buying and holding VS buying and selling- it‚Äôs just that it is easier (for many of us ) to buy and hold etfs than to buy and hold stocks long term. 

If you are trading stocks in a taxable account- even if you hold over a year so we are talking long term capitol gains- whatever you lose to taxes has essentially diminished your returns and this can be significant for a long term investor. Because the $1500 you pay in tax on $10,000 long term capital gain may not seem that bad this year ( after all you still made $8500!) BUT that $1500 invested over the next 20 years would add up. ( at 7 percent compounded, it would be $ 6000- it would roughly double 2x)  And each year you get capital gains on whatever you reinvest in and sell,  and lose more in tax you are further bleeding out the value of the account. (If you truly buy and hold stocks and don‚Äôt sell it is not a problem) - so anything you buy and hold ‚Äú forever‚Äù does not have to do as well year to year as an account with even moderate amount of buying and selling. Buying and selling stocks ( or etfs) - Year to year you may have better returns- before taxes. But maybe not after. 
Obviously it depends on how much better you do than the  etfs - consistently- ( or if you do better)- but i suspect for many of us one or a few good broad index etfs held long term is a better choice. I‚Äôve decided it is for me. 
- if you are buying and selling the etfs frequently- for example moving in and out of sectors- this does not apply. It is the relatively frequent buying and selling - and subsequent taxes- that diminishes your returns. 

OPs statement about etfs being tax advantaged is really in relation to the bit of rebalancing some people would do if holding stocks compared to an etf. The rebalancing that happens in the etf doesn‚Äôt cost us. fundamentally the big issue is holding something long term vs tax cost of buying and selling repeatedly. 

( my story for those not already bored)
- I have a mix of stocks and ETFs personally. And it‚Äôs only recently that the compounding effect of the tax cost over the years started to register with me. Before 2020 i did much l less trading. Since my brokerage account kept growing and I pay tax out of my checking account -the long term implication of trading- and resultant taxes- on overall growth didn‚Äôt quite register until this year. ( when i had enough capital gains that i needed to sell stocks to get the cash to pay my taxes).

-  in2020  i moved away from etfs and more into individual stocks because i feel the indexes were/ are getting distorted by a few overpriced and over hyped stocks. Indexes are basically forced to buy high and sell low when bubbles happen- so i decided to Cherry pick some stocks i had more faith in to ‚Äú rebalance‚Äù. - and i did a bit of gambling/ speculation on a few stocks too-some winning, some not- but now I‚Äôm sitting on capital gains and spending too much time trying to decide what to buy and sell. ( do you sell the stock with big gains to lock them in or the stock with losses that may go back up, or just ignore the question for now, etc) - meanwhile if i had left my money invested in the funds i sold as covid hit, id have had twice the gains- and paid no tax- and not be spending so much time obsessing over what to buy and sell.  (It‚Äôs the only time i ever sold on  news-  i always sat through dips before) anyhow,  lesson learned. Now trying to move slowly mostly back into etf funds, without incurring too much tax."
2021-07-03 08:08:23,stocks,"ETFs are fantastic, but they can be more or less tax efficient than stocks depending on your strategy. Some ETFs distribute capital gains like mutual funds, some ETFs will close and you will pay all of your gains at once, you can more effectively tax loss harvest individual stocks and actually have negative tax liabilities, you can also choose specific lots or high cost basis securities more effectively than ETFs when you sell.

For 99% of people they will be selling the ETF for income at some point, so you are going to have to prepare for very large tax consequences when you sell if you have large embedded gains.  If you have stocks you have more choice on what to sell from a tax management perspective.

Am I understanding ETFs properly?

If so, then this way you can see how each stock does individually, and cut out anything that does really poorly over the long run. With an excel sheet you can work out how much to buy based on an investment amount, so it really only just takes the time to buy each individual stock. But if you have autohotkey experience you can make a script that invests for you by doing all the clicking and typing, along with the calculations. Just type the amount in your '??.etf.ahk"" script and let it do its thing."

2021-07-03 09:51:18,stocks,"This is a great post. This is why I hold more ETFs in my taxable accounts than in the tax advantaged accounts (IRAs & 401Ks). 

It is a little tricky lately because of the way so many people are ""investing"" with options trading. So when a sector is on a run up in value (either from rebounding from the pandemic or because of pandemic demand), they'll pile in by buying calls and then when their options expire, the sector will sink back down (mostly) as they put their money into the next sector/stocks where they anticipate a run. So if you don't take profits at some time that's not the bottom, you're going to just rise and sink, rise and sink, making only small gains. This is one reason why value stocks and small cap stocks have done better than the general market for the past new months, because options traders avoid them, and you can actually sit on gains without the options traders market timing volatility. My point is that, even with ETFs in a tax advantaged account, in the past year, you have to take profits at some time if you want to minimize the downside of the regular deflations associated with options expiring, and other options related volatility. Because of the volatility with ETFs this year, being willing to sit in them no matter what vs taking profits becomes a choice of making 3x the gains but paying taxes on what you make. So I do have a lot more ETFs in the tax advantaged accounts, but I am finding myself taking at least some portion of profits and buying dips, even tho there are taxes due on that.

Fortunately, we have a 401K plan that allows you to put as much money into a brokerage account as you want, and stocks in that brokerage account, like an IRA, can all trade free of taxes on gains and income (dividends and interest). Now if I can only roll more money into the ROTH IRA, that would be ideal because that's totally tax-free, because you don't pay taxes on the withdrawals, either."

2021-07-03 16:43:39,stocks,"I'd argue ETFs perform below the average individual stock picker.

You suggest a small advantage in the ETF being able to sell for long term capital gains at all times, but every ETF has loser stocks I don't want, and ETFs tend to buy in late and sell late. TSLA is a great example of this, I bought in at $90 and $420 when it was clearly in an uptrend, while the S&P 500 bought in at $700 because it announced it 30 days in advance. 

Also, some ETFs hold companies I dislike for ethical reasons like MO (tobacco). If I can't get excited about a company and share the great news I discovered with my friends then I don't want to own it."

This is kinda a double edged tool. Registered account should be more conservative because I don‚Äôt have unlimited contribution room, thus I want to preserve that room and minimize loosing positions. But, if I can rebalance without paying taxes it pushes me to the more aggressive side.

You can imagine it‚Äôs the opposite with non-registered accounts: paying every time you rebalance a winning position (but also counting on capital loses for tax purposes) makes me more of an etf investor. But shouldn‚Äôt non-registered accounts be a bit more aggressive?

I hope you get my idea :)"
2021-07-03 17:56:45,stocks,"Dividends can add up quite quickly especially as you continue reinvesting them. Same with bond interest.

Assuming a 2.5% yield of bond interest and dividends, on a $2 Million portfolio that's $50,000 in taxable income per year, not even counting capital games. If you're still working, you'd likely need to increase your tax withholding at work by about $1,000-2,000 a month to cover those taxes or make quarterly tax payments to the IRS.

SoFi will rebalance this automatically every month. So picture what that means. Right now AMC is a hot stock with SoFi investors, so AMC is 12% of SFYF. But say AMC starts crashing in 3 months, and people start dumping. Then SFYF will rebalance automatically, sell and replace with something else.

You don't have to move a finger. SFYF is rebalancing automatically for you, and handling loses and gains. You don't see any taxes on that.

Another example is leveraged stuff. Something like TQQQ rebalances daily. So gains or losses are realized automatically, you don't have to do anything and you don't get taxed for every daily transaction.

Imagine trying to do these things on your own buying the stock directly."

Instead of buying and selling 10+ stocks - the ETF will do it for you.  Some ETFs also provide dividends, but not all.   The trade from individual stocks to ETFs is volume of trades.  If you want someone to manage it for you - You can buy one time and hold to let someone else do the short term work and you only get hit with expense fees rather than short/long term capital gains (until you actually sell the ETF yourself).  ETFs typically carry a pretty low expense ratio .02 (pretty low) to .2ish (which i consider as high).  

I own both FTEC and FENY and they have a .08 expense ratio.  FTEC has been going crazy because of all the massive gains in tech and its what I know and follow.  FENY is a nice dividend ETF, and its cheap.  I also use the Fidelity platform, which is why I also lean towards Fidelity ETFs.

2021-07-03 13:57:06,stocks,"There are a lot of nuances between MF and ETF. ETF can be essentially traded like stocks between investors. So I can buy and sell your SPY ETF for example.

MF are less liquid. You can‚Äôt trade them during the day or have options capability, and is only traded between the fund originator and you. Note that doesn‚Äôt mean you can only buy Vanguard MF from a Vanguard account- you can still buy them from most brokerages.

One thing to note is it‚Äôs best not to hold an actively-managed MF or ETF (ARK funds for example) in a tax-free account like a Roth IRA or Roth 401K due to the high fees. You can‚Äôt escape the fees in any account but in a taxable or tax-deferred account at least the fees will offset your gains to reduce your taxes."
2021-07-03 17:00:30,stocks,"FWIW, not all of Vanguard's MF fees are that high.  VWINX a pretty conservative fund, with much of its assets wrapped up bonds/mortgage securities, the expense ratios are going to be higher than an index fund because there's more to manage (or was pre-rise of AI managed funds). Also, the .22% expense ratio is actually among the lowest in this class of funds.

VTI will out perform in bull markets and over all, but in severe bear markets / crashes will underperform. If you're in/at retirement, VWINX gets more attractive because you're not earning income and can't weather a big down turn in the market. Looking at 2002 or 2008 -- in both those years VTI was down 21% & 37% respectively.  VWINX was down 5% & 10%. Much better place if you're not in the workforce anymore.

And after all those words, yeah if your gfs risk tolerance is greater than someone in retirement, then you are 100% right about moving to VTI."

2021-07-03 16:49:30,stocks,Its so ridiculous that I get down voted and you make such a comment. I have been a professional options trader for a few years now. Options are not inherently risky. They can be if you are ignorant and uninformed like the vast majority of people here. Options allow for steady and sustainable risk management if you know what you are doing.

2021-07-03 06:44:25,stocks,"Index funds minimise taxes because they dont make many changes to the portfolio. They dont avoid taxes, so they are not more tax-advantaged than me managing my own portfolio. If I own a portfolio of stocks and I hold them for a very long period, the effect is the same as holding index funds"
2021-07-03 15:25:46,stocks,"Wtf, are serious? That‚Äôs kinda incredible"
2021-07-03 17:59:51,stocks,"Sure. For example let‚Äôs use a Roth IRA that compounded 7% over 30 years at the current max contribution of $6K/year ($180K invested). You‚Äôll have approximately $567K ($387K profit) after 30 years.

Now run the same calculation but let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre holding something with a higher expense ratio like ARK funds, which have a 0.75% expense ratio (fee) so your rate of return is 6.25% annually. Assuming everything is the same you‚Äôre looking at $496K ($316K profit less principal investment) in 30 years. This is a loss difference of $71K due to fees alone. If you divide this by the profit of $387K you‚Äôll get 18.3%. In other word, that 0.75% Expense Ratio cost you over 18% in profit over 30 years.

If this is in a Roth IRA you‚Äôll just eat the fees. However, if this was in a traditional IRA or taxable account the fees will at least offset some of your gains for tax purposes. So you get taxed on $316K instead of $387K.

Note this is a very rough example because sometimes those high expense ratio funds can indeed outperform the broad market. ARKK for example crushed the S&P in 2020 generating 150% return versus 15%."

2021-07-03 19:27:29,stocks,Thank you very much for the response.    I was unaware of the significance of a .75 expense ratio.

2021-07-03 14:13:24,stocks,"That's my point, to the person that asked the question. They want people in the ETF because they are getting paid to run it. No reason to block access to it, the more the merrier."
2021-07-03 06:52:58,stocks,"Creation units is used to minimise tax related to funds inflows and outflows, not capital gains tax due to the fund rebalancing quaterly."
2021-07-03 06:59:53,stocks,So are you saying there is no tax efficiency advantage?
2021-07-03 07:06:11,stocks,"Yes. The only reason why individual investors ends up pay too much tax as compared to just buying index funds and holding them, is that they trade too much, whereas index funds make minimal changes to their portfolio.

Elon Musk has an incentive package that paid him a significant amount of money, over $50bil, If he was able to hit certain matrices. Part of that was keeping Tesla market cap over a certain amount. I can't remember off the top of my head but I believe it was $650bil for so many months in a row. So he became a master of manipulating the stock price in order to get his incentive bonuses. Deep down I believe this is why he bought Bitcoin. He knew that the company wasn't going to be profitable during the quarter that he bought Bitcoin. So he bought Bitcoin started manipulating it by promoting it through his Twitter account. This enabled Tesla to be profitable and saved him for his bonuses.

Do a quick Google search on Elon musk's incentive plan or read this article below to get more insight on how his pay plan works. Once you understand how it works and you stop to think about the things that he's done you'll understand

2021-07-02 23:17:13,stocks,"I wonder what Tesla will have to do when people start buying other EV‚Äôs. their cars are just way to expensive and not affordable, repairing them is also a pain because Tesla charges a lot for that. I feel they are the apple of vehicles currently when it comes to business practices."
2021-07-03 11:11:04,stocks,"It's impossible to predict when the stock is coming back to earth. Its relatively possible to predict it will. For tesla to have a ""healthy"" PE ratio of around 20, they would have to increase their earnings about 34 times. Considering a lot of their revenue doesn't come from selling cars (it comes from selling regulatory credits), you must assume that there will 34x more interest in those regulatory credits than there is now. Does that seem likely? To me, it doesn't. I see mean reversion as the only likely outcome. Most other car companies will increase their production of EV and Tesla will lose a lot of its market share. In Europe, tesla doesn't have the biggest market share anymore (Volkswagen does). It is also my assumption that most other cars companies will invest in releasing their own EV, thus (1) needing to buy less regulatory credits from Tesla and (2) stealing Tesla of their market share. So, is it more likely that Tesla will increase their profits 20-34x or is it more likely that they remain the same or even decrease? My money is on the second."

2021-07-03 10:45:38,stocks,"I have some similar views.  Tesla as a company is pretty solid. I just personally think the valuation is a bit off.  At one point the p/e was something like 1,700% right now I think it's close to 700%. Most of their profits (prior to the Bitcoin purchase) were derived from selling regulatory tax abatements. Had it not been for those (and Bitcoin) then Tesla wouldn't be profitable.

My only problem is the valuation.  It's way too high. Solid company with great technological advancements to the auto industry but valuation is too high."

2021-07-03 00:00:00,stocks,"Bought LEAP has since announced a reverse stock split I'm weeks-new, a mix of impatient and uneducated when it comes to the stock market. Having been rejected for option spreads (and ineligible to reapply for 60 days) my impatience spawned the ok idea of buying a LEAP on an industry poised to recover from COVID: hotels. Finding AHT as a bargain and doing some research (bc I barely know what I'm doing) I concluded ""this price is low, will probably go up or sideways"" and bought a deep ITM call for December. My profits went up -- then they got added to the Russel and the price dropped. I held, believing in the industry and ""unrealized"" losses. I wake up after a nap through market close and I read that there's gonna be a reverse stock split -- the price is friggin' *low* after I hastily opened my app.

So the advice I'm asking for is: is this typical when reverse stock splits are announced and does the price usually bounce back within months? Does this reverse  stock split fundamentally change anything since the option's strike price, quantity, and underlying changes accordingly?"
2021-07-03 10:04:42,stocks,I think Tuesday morning will have a small bounce up before bleeding down more. They are also diluting shares too. R/S plus share dilution is the worst combo

2021-07-03 00:00:00,stocks,"Requesting Risk Management Advice Hey all, I am a relatively new investor, and have been swing trading up until now. I have been on a losing streak recently and lost around 20% of my portfolio. Any advice for separating emotions from trading? I have traded with the GME craze, which combined with COVID has created a habit of monitoring my investments constantly. My risk tolerance is not very great and I will panic if I am down 10%. I have been trying to follow a set of guidelines I created before I invest and to plan out the investment beforehand (entry, stop loss, exit, trends), but my mind just shuts down when the losses start stacking up and I always abandon my plan. Does anyone have suggestions for risk management?"
2021-07-02 20:28:48,stocks,"I can tell you two things about the greatest traders I know(these guys are multimillionaires).

One is that they have unbelievably tight stop losses. If they even get a hint that they‚Äôre trade is not going as planned they abandon it immediately.  

The second is that they only trade fundamentally solid stocks. These would be things like roku, baba, amd, aapl, crwd.. They would never touch anything like GME or amc.

So i‚Äôm in a baba trade right now. Last week I entered around $211 when it looked like it was breaking out. I expected it to fail at 230 because of that massive volume candle on 12/24/2020, it did, and then I sold at 229. 

I entered baba again today, as I believe it will bounce off its previous resistance. I believe that resistance is now support. I entered baba today at $217.05. My stop loss is set at 216. Very, very tight stop loss. If we go below 216 I believe the next stop is 211-ish.

I‚Äôm only telling you this so you can go look at the chart and reference what i‚Äôm talking about if you‚Äôre interested. 

Stick with great companies and have tight stop losses ‚úåÔ∏è"

There was no consolidation area and there was no other channel that might act as resistance. It was a free ride to 230. I'd be happy to explain more but I don't want to type up a bunch of stuff you don't understand yet."

2021-07-03 00:00:00,stocks,"IWM (Russel) is forming a tight wedge  It is currently positioned at the bottom of an up trending channel with RSI of 52 on the day. Given the bullish SPX/NQ breakouts I am leaning towards bullish. But because I bought calls, I am expecting a flat to bearish outcome. 

I see an upside potential of around \~247. However, my ""time to turn bearish"" target for SPY is 434 which we pretty much hit today. DJI looks like its going to break out to the upside as well, so I hope it drags IWM with it while QQQ and SPY cool off.

# **Fed could be a surprise catalyst for the markets in holiday week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/fed-could-be-a-surprise-catalyst-for-markets-in-holiday-week-.html)**
*****
> The quiet holiday week ahead could hold some fireworks for investors if the Federal Reserve reveals its thinking on its bond buying program.
*****
> The four-day trading week could see stocks drift, after hitting new highs this past week. The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield has held under 1.5%, a positive for tech which outperformed with a 3.2% gain for the week.
*****
> There are very few economic reports of note, aside from ISM services data on Tuesday. But the Fed‚Äôs minutes from its last meeting will be released Wednesday afternoon, and there is potential for the market to learn more about the central bank‚Äôs behind-the-scenes discussions on winding down its quantitative easing program.
*****
> ‚ÄúOur base case is that rates drift higher, but in order to that get that move higher you need a catalyst to get there,‚Äù said Brian Daingerfield, head of G10 FX strategy Americas at NatWest Markets. ‚ÄúEither the Fed has to move forward aggressively on tapering, or you have to get the data really rocking, and you don‚Äôt have either.‚Äù
*****
> Friday‚Äôs report that 850,000 jobs were added in June was better than expected. However, the unemployment rate missed expectations after rising by 0.1 percentage points to 5.9%. Economists expected the rate to fall to 5.6%. The report was not seen as strong enough to encourage the Fed to step away sooner from its easy policies. It was, however, seen as a positive ‚Äî yet largely incomplete ‚Äî picture of the labor market.
*****
> Daingerfield said there is the potential for the Fed‚Äôs June meeting minutes to surprise the market, similar to the way April minutes did.
*****
> ‚ÄúRemember, Powell said they were not talking about talking about tapering,‚Äù he said, referring to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell‚Äôs comments right after the April meeting. ‚ÄúRemember, Powell was very dismissive, and then the minutes revealed a kind of drift to the committee.‚Äù
*****
> The April meeting minutes did surprise investors when they noted that ‚Äúa number of participants‚Äù said it would be appropriate to begin discussing tapering bond purchases at upcoming meetings if the economy continues to make rapid progress. After the June meeting, Powell revealed early stage discussions about paring back bond buying. The Fed also presented a new forecast that included two rate hikes in 2023, where there were none indicated before.
*****
> The market is highly sensitive to details about the Fed‚Äôs bond purchase program since the ending to that measure would be open the door for the central bank to raise interest rates. The low-rate environment has been the kindling behind the stock market‚Äôs robust gains since the Fed went all out to help the economy get through the pandemic. Cutting back on the monthly $120 billion bond purchases would be the first rollback of those extraordinary measures.
*****
> ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot we don‚Äôt know about the Fed‚Äôs thinking about tapering,‚Äù Daingerfield said. He said key information would be when it plans to start, how rapidly it will move to wind down the program and how it decides to break down its current monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasurys and $40 billion in mortgage securities.
*****
> ‚ÄúThese details really do matter. Did they get into that conversation at all about details? The more detail they discussed, the more likely it is they are looking to move forward sooner,‚Äù Daingerfield said. Fed watchers widely expect more details about tapering the bond program around its annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming in late August, and then start slowing purchases later this year or early in 2022.
*****
> For now, the positive tone in the bond market has helped stocks. The 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, has fallen from its high of the year of about 1.75%. At that level, technology and growth shares were under pressure.
*****
> But they‚Äôve been making a comeback as rates drift around in a range below 1.6%. The 10-year was at 1.43% Friday, and while the lower rate may help tech stocks, the yield level is a sharp contrast to an economy that was expected to grow at more than 10% in the second quarter.
*****
> That pace is expected to slow, but growth for the year is expected to be robust at more than 7%.
*****
> # Tech transition
> Citi Private Bank chief investment strategist Steven Wieting said that, with the economy peaking, the time is right for investors to begin transitioning to tech and growth shares from the popular cyclical trade.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing this as all a temporary period of massive distortions, and within a year from now, we‚Äôll be on steadier water,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think this is giving people a reason, including us, to move away from just cyclical rebound trades and into some sustainable growth opportunities.‚Äù
*****
> Year to date, cyclicals have been some of the better performers. Energy shares are up 44.5% with the rebound in oil prices, and financials have bounced 25.2%. In contrast, S&P 500 growth stocks are up 14.3%, lagging slightly the S&P 500‚Ä≤s 15.5% gain. Tech stocks are up just 14.9% year-to-date.
*****
> One area Wieting now likes is global health care. The S&P 500 health care sector was up 12.5% for the year so far.
*****
> ‚ÄúHealth care is a mid-cycle outperformer. Health care is a part of the economy that didn‚Äôt fall as hard,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEarnings and revenues have grown moderately every year since the mid-1980s.‚Äù He said the sector has lagged the S&P 500 since the end of 2019 by 10 percentage points, and has a cheap valuation. Big pharma stocks are among the best dividend payers.
*****
> For the major sectors, on a 12-month basis, the cyclical sectors of industrials, materials, and energy have all risen more than 40%, and tech has had a similar 42% gain.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe growth stocks have stayed rich. The value stocks have completely caught up with growth stocks in 12-month performance, but the valuation hasn‚Äôt been beaten down in growth stocks,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGradually we‚Äôre going to get more sustained performance out of tech after this period where it flatlined.‚Äù
*****
> Wieting said one area that is particularly attractive is cybersecurity, where demand is strong as a ‚Äútech spending essential,‚Äù but the sector has gone nowhere.
*****
> For instance, the iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF IHAK is just below its 52 week high set in January, and the Global X Cybersecurity ETF BUG is trading about a dollar below its February high.
*****
> Wieting said he likes some alternative energy names and companies that are involved in digitization, including fintech.
*****
> He expects the overall stock market to move higher but not at the same rapid clip.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe want to start transitioning portfolios away from just rebound plays...We‚Äôre transitioning, knowing we‚Äôve captured significant outperformance over the past year with cyclical value. It made people comfortable investing in equities when we could show how cheap they were,‚Äù he said.
*****
> The S&P 500 ended the week up 1.7% at a record 4,352, while the Dow climbed 1% to 34,786. The Nasdaq was 1.9% higher, ending the week at a record 14,639.

Yesterday‚Äôs gains are consistent with historical trends for the first trading day of July. Over the past twenty-one years, July has on average begun with respectable gains. The second trading day has been weaker, but after this the major indexes have tended to trend solidly higher through mid-month to around the thirteenth trading day. At this point the major indexes have tended to weaken and trade sideways to lower to finish out the month.

> # Sentiment Has Perked Up

> Sentiment has taken a big step up in the past week. The AAII weekly sentiment survey saw 48.6% of respondents report as bullish this week, up 8.2 percentage points from last week for the highest reading since the week of April 22nd when over half of respondents reported as optimists. Not only is this week's reading ten percentage points above the historical average, but the one-week increase was the largest since an 11.1 percentage point jump during the week of April 8th. Similarly, the Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers saw bullish sentiment jump from 56.5% last week to an eight-week high of 59.6%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/070121-AAII-Bull.png)**

> Considering bearish sentiment was already muted, that big increase in bullish sentiment was only met with a 1.1 percentage point decline in bearish sentiment. Only 22.2% of respondents reported as bearish this week, the lowest reading since June 10th.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/070121-AAII-Bear.png)**

> While bearish sentiment did not experience a particularly large decline, it was an inverse move to bullish sentiment which resulted in the bull-bear spread climbing 9.3 points to the highest level since April 22nd. That means sentiment continues to largely favor the bulls. Prior to the past year, late 2017 and early 2018 was the only other period in recent years that the bull-bear spread was at similar levels to now.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/070121-AAII-Spread.png)**

> Given the jump in bullish sentiment did not borrow from bearish sentiment, neutral sentiment took a significant hit this week falling 7.4 percentage points. That was both the biggest one-week decline and marks the lower level in neutral sentiment since April.

> # Market Stronger Day Before than After Independence Day

> Over the last 21 years, the trading day before Independence Day has been stronger than the day after. DJIA and S&P 500 have advanced 66.7% of the time with average gains of 0.13% and 0.11% respectively on the day before. Based upon average performance, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are slightly softer on the day before, but still lean bullish. On the trading day after Independence Day DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 have declined more frequently than advanced. DJIA has recorded the fewest number of advances while Russell 2000 has the worst average performance with a 0.10% loss.

> # Stocks Only Going Up In The First Half

> One of the most remarkable aspects of the past six months has been the lack of a significant pullback. The S&P 500 has not seen a 5% pullback since October, and since the start of the year, the most it had fallen from a high was 4.23% from mid-February to March 4th. Besides that and another smaller 4% pullback in May, it has been a one-way trip higher. Looking back through the history of the S&P 500, there are not many other years in which the index went the entire first half without at least a 5% pullback. Below we show the chart of the S&P 500 for each of the 14 years that, like this year, did not experience a pullback of at least 5% in the first half. . As shown, six of these (highlighted in green)‚Äî1954, 1958, 1964, 1993, 1995, and most recently 2017‚Äîactually did not see a 5% or larger pullback in the second half of the year either.

> As for the other years, the S&P 500 did generally tend to move higher for at least part of the second half, but there have been a range of declines. The year with the largest decline in the second half was 1986 when the index fell 9.42% in September. And that was after a 7.53% decline shortly after the midpoint of the year in the first two weeks of July. The 1959 occurrence similarly saw a 9.17% decline from August through September. While it did not necessarily all happen within the second half of the year, the declines in the final days of the 1961 occurrence actually marked the beginning of a bear market that ultimately would see the S&P 500 fall 23.6% from its late 1961 peak.

2021-07-02 22:46:31,stocks,I see money flowing into Chinese tech stocks very soon. Anticipating a pullback in spy and another month or so below 430. Also keeping a close eye on palantir and my darling asts space mobile.

2021-07-02 20:12:25,stocks,Time to head to growth. I see airlines picking up more activity. Lots of airlines are at pre-pandemic levels of travel. I suggest southwest (luv) as it heavily focuses on domestic routes and it‚Äôs got the healthiest book compared to other airlines. Current price $53.56 PT next week $56. Before earnings $56-57. After earnings probably $59 with good report.

For their mining equipment branch, they have a handful of competitors (Komatsu & Hitachi) but CAT, once again, is huge and covers a broad range of areas including government contracts. The list keeps going but I‚Äôd have to go with this Industrial. My second choice would be BRK.A/BRK.B for reasons explained throughout this thread."

Edit: I‚Äôll take the downvotes. JPM has historically beaten the S&P 500 (beats in YTD, 1YR, 5 YR, 10 YR, and max history), it‚Äôs currently trading at a 12.4 PE, boasts a 2.3% yield, has excellent revenue growth, and does all of this without leaning on a moat. The greatest described threat has been the rise of fintech, and JPM has the awareness, humility, and cash required to adapt and thrive. This is a very old company which is still a power in its space, and has proven that it can stay at the top as other powerful companies rise and fall. You may not like this choice, but it would be silly to say that it‚Äôs a poor selection if limited to one stock."

You basically ignore risk altogether. And you do not specify your risk tollerance. There is no 0-risk stock. If you cannot be hands-on, then ETFs are the way. And even then there is a risk.

GME is not a meme stock - look at the transformation the company is making! I simply like the stock and answered this question truthfully. Why should the mods have the power to decide which stocks are meme stocks and enforce censorship accordingly? 

It‚Äôs sad to see this sub and other similar subs alienating a whole subsection of people because of their fondness of certain stocks; NEWS FLASH - this sub is called r/stocks and GME is a stock.

The media has vilified ‚Äòmeme stocks‚Äô and ‚Äòmeme stock holders‚Äô by pushing the narrative that the only people involved are dumb money - FALSE. Yes, the subs which heavily talk about these stocks definitely have a culture entrenched in memes but alongside that is excellent DD from some very intelligent individuals. 

I get it, due to the connotations surrounding some particular stocks the mods think this will devalue the user perception of this sub - this is no excuse for censoring free discussion and alienating those who believe in the future of the GameStop company, simply because the mods have decided they think it‚Äôs a meme stock.

To be clear, in no way is this comment supposed to be an attack on this sub - I‚Äôm seeking civil discourse and clarity."

2021-07-03 15:21:44,stocks,"Microsoft in the 1990s was the most valuable company in the world switching spots with GE, it is currently the only company that was in the top 10 list in 1990 and is currently still top 10 right now (at #2 spot behind apple). It was the #1 company by marketcap in 2019 and march 2020.

Moreover, It has never fallen out of the top 10 list for more than 20+ years even with failure of Ballmer, tech bubble crash, Nokia, etc. Now with the new ceo, I dont see it going out of the top 10 especially since it is so far ahead from #10 spot which is Alibaba at 600 billion market cap. (Microsoft is worth 2.1 trillion).

Back in the 1990s #1 spot had 200 billion valuation compared to 100 billion for #10 spot. So now the Top 5 companies are much more valuable compared to the bottom 5 of the list. Unlike the 1990s the top companies were not investing to the future and focus on short term profits.

Microsoft continues to invest in the future with the cloud technology, ai, vr/ar tech as well as is extremely diversified with equal 33% weight in 3 different classified segments.(the other trillion companies aren't as diversified). Finally, it is one of two companies (other being JNJ) with triple AAA credit rating, higher than the US government. It faces less regulatory risk than tech giants competitors allowing for easy acquisitions thanks to its stellar balance sheet.

Obviously a low starting point but thats all I have to work with for the time being. I would be able to beef that up about 100-200 bucks every couple of weeks as I'm I get paid bi-weekly. 

Everyone and their mother will tell you to diversify your account but is that really the way to go with such a small account? Isn't it said that concentration builds wealth and diversification preserves it.

 Should look into how to trade options as the roi would be greater than owning stocks? How do I go about doing my due diligence? Where can you find info on a companies financials, yahoo finance perhaps? Thanks for any and all advise you can give to this noob."

Over the past two years I‚Äôve consistently underperformed the S&P and greatly underperformed the NASDAQ (which I consider my benchmark given my heavy asset allocation in technology). 

This makes me wonder, why not just compose a portfolio of all ETF‚Äôs and indices. Was thinking of a combination of SPY, DIA, NDAQ, QQQ, ARKK, etc. maybe even incorporate sector ETF‚Äôs like QCLN/ICLN, THCX, IAU (gold, to hedge against inflation), and some small/mid-cap funds.

I feel like this strategy would help me diversify greatly and mitigate risk as much as possibly while generating above market returns. I‚Äôd probably go with something along the lines of 40% SPY, 30% QQQ, 15% ARKK, 5% QCLN, 5% THCX, 5% IAU. Aside from expense ratio fees I feel like this would help me beat the market and I can even incorporate automatic weekly deposits into the SPY and QQQ accordingly.

DIA is inside SPY already and is a joke of an index. Wouldn't chase recent performance with QQQ and ARKK. Keep in mind the market is already over 27% tech.

2021-07-03 02:26:59,stocks,"Why do you think you‚Äôd be able to beat the market through a specific portfolio of ETF‚Äôs? Do you mean beat the market as measured by total return or by risk-adjusted return? The former is simple, you can simply take on more risk for a higher expected return e.g. invest in high beta stocks; but beating the market on a risk-adjusted basis (which is all anyone should really discuss in regards to ‚Äúbeating the market‚Äù) is a different story.

Burton Malkiel‚Äôs book ‚ÄúA Random Walk Down Wall Street‚Äù discusses factor tilts- overweighting certain stocks with certain characteristics (like small-size or value or tech)- in order to beat the market on a risk-adjusted basis, with risk being measured by beta. His conclusion, backed by evidence, is that factor tilts ultimately aren‚Äôt effective, and that any risk-adjusted excess returns generated by factor tilts are in actuality likely due to problems with our measures of risk (beta in this case), rather than truly beating the market.

I‚Äôd check out that chapter in the book; I can link a pdf if you‚Äôre curious.

2021-07-03 16:49:05,stocks,">I‚Äôve studied Finance and Data Science throughout college and use a variety of fundamental, technical, and financial strategies to select the best stocks for my personal portfolio.

Were you successful in your strategies? Did you accomplish your goals according to your risk tolerance?

&#x200B;

>Over the past two years I‚Äôve consistently underperformed the S&P and greatly underperformed the NASDAQ (which I consider my benchmark given my heavy asset allocation in technology).

The past two years have been aggressively bullish. Did your risk tolerance and goals match that bullishness? Trying to ""beat the market"" makes sense as a gauge on much longer periods than two years. Especially if those two years are aggressively bullish. The market needs time to correct itself and separate those who have been doing careful and diligent moves from those that are half-assing or yoloing it.

&#x200B;

>This makes me wonder, why not just compose a portfolio of all ETF‚Äôs and indices. Was thinking of a combination of SPY, DIA, NDAQ, QQQ, ARKK, etc. maybe even incorporate sector ETF‚Äôs like QCLN/ICLN, THCX, IAU (gold, to hedge against inflation), and some small/mid-cap funds.  
I feel like this strategy would help me diversify greatly and mitigate risk as much as possibly while generating above market returns. I‚Äôd probably go with something along the lines of 40% SPY, 30% QQQ, 15% ARKK, 5% QCLN, 5% THCX, 5% IAU. Aside from expense ratio fees I feel like this would help me beat the market and I can even incorporate automatic weekly deposits into the SPY and QQQ accordingly.  
Let me know what you think of this strategy oppose to spending so much time researching and conducting analyses only to underperform the market.

ETFs make a lot of sense if you want to follow the market. Beating it is not going to be easy or guaranteed though.

How did you select those ETFs? Do you consider now being a good time to open a position on them? What is your time frame and investing installments? How did you check their risk mitigation? Did you research them for overlap? Did you check for covariance or correlation in their prices?"
2021-07-02 23:20:37,stocks,"While you want to move on to the next strategy - what I would do in your scenario - reanalyze the entire strategy, the tactics used to apply it, and how it differs from the benchmarks to begin with."

2021-07-03 00:25:09,stocks,"You basically never have to create a taxable event with ETFs. It is like having a 401k outside of a 401k. Picking stocks you constantly have to realize gains even if you are very long duration and conservative. ETFs make internal trades and you don‚Äôt pay taxes on that shift in exposure. 

I am sure you understand this, but if you think about it like it is a 401k with no early withdrawal fees, how could you not? 

There are other reasons too, but dude it is basically a tax advantaged account if you never sell. 

I sometimes find it difficult to find an ETF that fits my investment thesis, so I combine with some stock picks too, but the large majority is ETFs. 

Also, you can keep it a bit interesting by taking slight bets on macro trends if you are into that. And keep a small portion for stock picking just to prove to yourself over time you made the right decision going etf."

3) buy etfs that align to subasset classes

4) buy stocks where you can beat the index (FTSE, Russell 2000, etc.)

Asset allocation doesnt mean buy every index.  The indexes largely own the same things.  

Ill make it easy for you.  Take the sub asset class capialization weights of the Russell 3000 and use them for your US stock and use the FTSE all cap weights, and build an asset allocation.  Youll outperform if you include small size factors in your portfolio rather than just buying shitty tech companies like everyone else on these subs."

2021-07-03 11:04:12,stocks,"I did once. Lost money. Learned a lot. Here are some quick words of advice. 

Watch for SP overload.  So many etfs are a recreation of the SP components. A major SP loss can be amplified throughout your portfolio. 

Avoid shorts. But if you do do not short bond etfs.  The cost out weighs the potential profit. 

Watch foreign etfs. I made and lost so much on the Brazil etf. The std dev was outrageous

2021-07-03 11:50:23,stocks,"I guess I'm biased and hopeful because I tilt Value, and the valuation spread between Growth as a whole and Value as a whole is as large as it's ever been (2000 levels). I don't stock pick. I'm satisfied with my exposure to Big Tech via the S&P 500 since it makes up a comparatively huge chunk. I also work in tech so I try to diversify *away* from that human capital."

2021-07-03 13:47:39,stocks,"That's because QQQ is NASDAQ top 100 US companies, SPY is top 500 via Standard & Poor's.

Accounting for weight and percentages, 78% of QQQ will definitely also be in SPY.

EDIT: Additionally, S&P 500 is dictated by a group of eggheads in New England who decide which of the top companies are allowed to be in the S&P500, so it's not *actually* the TOP 500 companies, but a selection of 500 **of the** best performing companies."

2021-07-03 00:00:00,stocks,"What Can I Learn from Today Hi Everyone,

New to investing, and have followed the flowchart in personal finance to the letter.

Ultimately I decided to try an individual stock. After poking around, I noticed that NTLA experienced a breakthrough that is set to lead the company to grow substantially. I decided that was my stock. This was Sunday.

I could not buy any shares of this stock because Vanguard would not let me do anything until my deposited funds cleared. I watched it gain every day. Finally my funds clear and I buy a few shares yesterday at $170. Today, the stock dropped about 5%. I have no idea why or what happened. That‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm just trying to learn. 

I just want to know if there is anything about what I have done that can be instructive for me. Thanks"
2021-07-02 20:51:44,stocks,"You will be fine.  Most Bio-Tech stocks don't make money until they are done with their clinical trials, get FDA approval for their treatments and get contracts with major Pharmaceutical companies.  I have around 10 Bio-Tech stocks in my portfolio.  Unfortunately, many of them often dilute by selling more shares to the public to fund their research and pay for their G&A costs.  It's just a necessary evil since they aren't bringing in much revenue.  Any good news on their clinical trials usually boosts the stock like you saw with NTLA (which I hold as well).  It's definitely a good sector to be in right now especially with all the Covid variants as therapeutics are essential.  Just be prepared for volatility and dilution and hold for the long term.  I can't even imagine holding that one that eventually finds a cure for cancer!"

2021-07-03 00:00:00,stocks,"% intraday change in price average over long period of time Is there a screener that allows you to find how much a stock/asset price has changed in terms of percentage, but not just for that day but the average % change for a whole month or year or longer?  And then rank/compare to other assets.  And by average % change I mean the average DAILY change. The ones I am seeing just shows you for the current day"
2021-07-02 20:56:54,stocks,I do see the ATR and it can be set under 5 to over 5.  I am not sure I am understanding it
2021-07-02 21:38:04,stocks,"True range for a day is the largest of three different calculations: either the high - low, the high - previous close, or the low - previous close (absolute values for negative numbers).

Average true range is the average of true ranges over whatever time period.  The drop down menu is the ATR value itself, not the time period.  I checked, and Finviz uses 14 days for ATR.

So an ATR of 5 means over the last 14 days, the true range for each day has averaged 5.

Problem with it is true range is a $ value, not a %, so stocks with a high price have a higher ATR on smaller % moves, so it's not useful as a screener. It's only useful for comparisons of the same stock over time.

Volatility is expressed as a %, so it's more useful as a screen."

Some other people will say the real money is in point to point, which virgin galactic hasn‚Äôt commented on in at least a year. 

The question is do you think there is a market for space tourism? If you answer yes, how big Will this market be? What is realistic? If vg can execute on their plan, how much money and revenue can they make? 

They are on the brink of commercial operations, we will hopefully see them fly commercial passengers next year and get a gauge of how big the market is when ticket sales re open. This is when we will find out how much demand there is for space travel(sub orbiting flight). I hope there is a lot because we won‚Äôt be gettjng space mining and all this other cool stuff if there isn‚Äôt rich people willing throw money at space tourism. 

There is a risk of a crash if course, but the demand is what will be interesting to find out. Do I think it could be a 50B dollar company. I do. This is a lower valuation than carnival cruises we‚Äôre prior to the pandemic. I‚Äôm 3700 shares in at 32 dollars. Pumped for commercial operations next year.

2021-07-03 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, July 2, 2021. Please enjoy! **PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 2, 2021**

Stocks rose once again, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) both recording new intraday highs amid the continued push by technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA) rose as well, but continued to lag behind the other two indexes. Market participants are encouraged by the June Jobs Report, which showed payroll gains rise more than expected. 

Today, the US Department of Labor released the Job June report, which showed a stronger-than-expected acceleration in hiring, with non-farm payrolls rising by 850,000, the sixth straight month of gains. The unemployment rate however, ticked slightly higher to 5.9%. Here are the numbers

* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** 850,000 vs. 720,000 expected and an upwardly revised 583,000 in May
* **Unemployment rate:** 5.9% vs. 5.6% expected and 5.8% in May 
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.3% vs. 0.3% expected and a downwardly revised 0.4% in May
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 3.6% vs. 3.6% expected and a downwardly revised 1.9% in May

President Biden said of the report, ‚ÄúThis is historic progress, pulling our economy out of the worst crisis in 100 years, driven in part by our dramatic progress in vaccinating our nation and beating back the pandemic. Today, the US is the only major advanced economy where the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) projections of future output are higher today than they were in January 2020 before the pandemic hit.‚Äù

Emily Roland, co-Chief Investment Strategist at John Hancock Investment Management said of the report, ‚ÄúThis is the Goldilocks Report that the market was looking for today. You had a nice print here of 850,000 jobs being added, wage pressure remaining ‚Äì I wouldn't call them necessarily contained ‚Äì but surprising here on the downside versus consensus estimates. So this is telling us right now that economic growth is continuing to accelerate here, the jobs market is continuing to heal. We're making progress here in terms of what the Fed has set out to do, which is in order to get unemployment down, they're going to let inflation run a little bit hot here. Not too hot, not too cold ‚Äì this is just what the market wants.""

This Job Report will give market participants a better idea as to the timing of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs next monetary policy. For now, the Fed has so far kept in place both of its key pandemic-era policies - quantitative easing at a clip of $120 billion a month and near-zero interest rates. However, the Fed has consistently said they are looking for a ‚Äústring‚Äù of strong jobs reports, like the one this month before any adjustments to the current policy is made. If the Jobs Report continues being especially strong in the months ahead, it could force the Fed to taper quantitative easing earlier than originally telegraphed. I have said  before in the past I expect the Fed to begin tapering QE towards the end of the year and am not worried about that at all. For starters, the market has historically reacted very little to changes in QE ([see the 2013 Taper Tantrum here)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp), it‚Äôs changes in the interest rate that really drive the market, and second, the Fed is expected to taper slowly, making any changes gradual.

**Highlights**

* Shares of AMC pulled back slightly after financial firm Iceberg Research announced they have opened a short position. Honestly, I have no idea why they did this, only opening themselves up to becoming WSB's next target. Will be interesting to see what happens moving forward.
* More bad news for Lordstown Motors, who have already been the subject of a short report that saw the company admit they had inflated the importance of preorders for the electric pickup truck and forced the CEO to leave. Now, the Justice Department has announced it is opening a probe into the company to investigate comments made by executives and the way the company represented its pre orders to shareholders. The whole EV market was down today in sympathy. 
* Tesla (TSLA) recorded its fifth straight quarter of vehicle delivery growth. In Q2, the company delivered 201,250 vehicles, missing expectations for 204,160, according to Bloomberg consensus data**,** but more than double the 90,891 vehicles delivered in the same period a year ago.
* The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a proposed consent order to settle antitrust charges against semiconductor maker Broadcom Inc, the agency said in a statement on Friday. The consent order requires Broadcom to stop demanding that its customers buy components mostly or only from Broadcom. The company responded, ‚ÄúWhile we disagree that our actions violated the law and disagree with the FTC‚Äôs characterizations of our business, we look forward to putting this matter behind us.""

Is it a company decision or is there some other mechanism behind? Like some valuation requirement or maybe time?

For example, today Astra Space (HOL -> ASTR) went public on Nasdaq. I would like to find it on a German stock exchange. What are the probabilities it will be listed and how?

I‚Äôm currently looking into a good REIT investment, but am having a bit of trouble determining which is the best moving forward.

As we all know, the real estate market is in a weird state, and housing prices as a whole are climbing and likely to continue climbing for a solid 2 years or so as we recover from Covid causing housing prices to rise more and have issues with supply or demand, differentiated based on the economic status of different areas throughout the US of course. Unfortunately at 19 yrs old, I don‚Äôt have the capital or experience to start when the market is rising with no real climax being predictable. So the obvious solution (for me) would be a RIET.

My best contender as of right now is CTRE, but as they manage healthcare properties, I would like a more residential/ city infrastructure option if possible.

In my scenario you buy multiple lots over a period of months and then sell all at once with a single order with some of the lots being sold at a loss and others being sold with profit and the overall total being profit.  If the stock then drops within the month and I want to buy additional shares at a price lower than what I sold, are the wash sale rules going to apply because of the lots that were sold at a loss or does the fact they were all sold at once for an overall profit wipe the slate clean?

I‚Äôve tried searching for this answer but am not finding this scenario so I may just be phrasing this poorly. Thank you."
2021-07-02 20:57:11,stocks,"Not an accountant, but the way I read the rules is that since you aren‚Äôt declaring a loss on the first transaction, the wash sales rules don‚Äôt apply.

2021-07-02 22:48:39,stocks,"I could be off but In your G/L summary for your brokerage account your realized gains will be broken down by lot (purchase date) and so you may be have disallowed losses given you are buying back the position within the wash sale period. I know for Schwab, in my transaction history/realized gains tab, my taxable trades break down by lot if I‚Äôm selling multiple lots. Even though your sale order is a net gain, that net gain is still broken down per lot. That being said, def check with your brokerage.hope this helps!"
2021-07-03 06:39:50,stocks,"Think of it as the loss being written off against the gain in instant time.  
You have 2 lots, one is +10 the other is -3. When you sell, the ""loss"" is offset against the ""gain"" immediately, so your gain (and taxable amount) is +7. You don't have any loss to write off against future taxes from the sale event.

If you rebuy the position within the month frankly you'd be better off it applied the wash sale rule and increased your nominal cost basis, because then you pay lower taxes when you sell (because you, notionally, made less money on the sale due to the adjusted cost basis)."

For example, if I buy .25 shares of Microsoft every week, will I really have 1 full share after 4 weeks? Or will I just have 4 separately acknowledged fractional shares of MSFT?

I‚Äôm wondering because some brokerage apps (I think Robinhood, for example) don‚Äôt allow the transfer of fractional shares to a new app ‚Äî they just sell those and give you cash for it I believe.

What happened was people transferred their property out of Robinhood (everyone should) and then Robinhood had to purchase those securities they never purchased when the retail invester paid for it. So people who bought GameStop at $150/share are getting transfer statements saying shares purchased anywhere from $15-600.

If you go to sell your share after 1 month it doesn't matter because they are all short term gains.

If you want to sell a specific share, for instance, you can't do that with fractionals; at least I know that's the case with Fidelity (and probably all other brokers). You can only specify any whole shares you may have bought, but you cannot specify which fractionals you want to sell.

So fractionals are a little less liquid than whole shares, but that shouldn't matter too much if you're investing on a longish-term horizon."

2021-07-03 00:00:00,stocks,"90% of Net Asset in Stocks ‚Äî Anxious I have started buying stocks with very little money back in 2014. 
Never brought anything risky and did not see much growth.


Then in 2016 I got a ‚ÄòTech‚Äô Job in Silicon Valley where Salary is heavy in RSU ( restricted stock unit) and employees can buy with ESPP ( 15% discount on fair market value)

That Company ( Company A) did really good in next 4 years and by 2020 I have around 500k in Vested stock + ESPP purchase. 
Never sold any.


Then in 2020 I got a job in one of the FAANG companies ( Company B) with even a bigger chunk of RSU + ESPP 


After first vest ( 2021) and espps in Company B, I have around 200k in this FAANG company stock.


So now my situation is :
I have only around 80k in my checking account. ( had little more but spent on a down payment)
Around 50k in 401k ( started in 2020 only, never before understood it + Company B has very good match) but funds selected are 100% stocks again.


500k stocks from previous company ( Company A)


200k stocks in current company B ( and more adding up every quarter by vesting + ESPP)


Another 150k in my personal trading account.


So 80k cash + 50k (401k ‚Ä¶ in stock funds üòû) + around ‚Äò850k‚Äô of pure stocks( and some option trading money )


Both the tech companies are good + long time players + have steady growth in earnings and not some loss making unicorns like Uber/Airbnb etc ‚Ä¶ but by any means their price looks overvalued ( Don‚Äôt know by how much, my current company B is one having 2T market cap yet no sign of stopping üòî)


I have huge ‚Äòanxiety‚Äô on what to do.

A) I don‚Äôt want to sell previous ( Company A ) and Current ( Company B) companies stocks with the ‚Äòfear‚Äô that they might grow even more.( Company A already 5x from original value in 2016)

BUT

B) Most of my last 6 years savings are bound to stock and although I was much younger to experience 1999/2008 crash but heard about them + all the predictions on inflation/another crash and SCARED to lose all these money if and when that happens.

So any good advice for a novice from a kind soul is much appreciated."

I am not sure you could call it ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù at all (no offense meant), rather, I would say, it is merely *rephrasing* the situation in different terms, using relative change (percentage) instead of absolute change. And the way you formulate it, you‚Äôre holding it as somehow self-evident that relative change is more ‚Äúnatural‚Äù to describe price trajectories, i.e., that a +X% change is just as probable as a -X% change. Why is that self-evident? Why should (in this example) a $800 ‚Üí $600 ‚Üí $750 price trajectory be more ‚Äúnatural‚Äù than a $800 ‚Üí $600 ‚Üí $800 one?

2021-07-03 10:31:54,stocks,"Lots; in fact, the hype is a huge portion of the value.

Value is comprised of *intrinsic* and *speculative* components.  Intrinsic relates to the hard numbers of earnings per share, P/E ratio, and so on.  Speculative is price movement caused by investors driving the share price up or down based on their collective sentiment that the company is either growing or shrinking.

When P/E ratio is about average, intrinsic value is largely driving the price.  When P/E ratio is considerably lower or higher than average, speculative factors are weighing more heavily on the value.

Speculative factors can change quickly and dramatically, making a stock more volatile than when intrinsic value is the primary driver of its worth at a given time."

I have 100 shares so essentially I would like to set up an option to call them away from me if it reaches a lower level, would that be a cash covered call? I would be looking to make passive income on the option.

Go easy on me, I'm new at this :D

ETA: It doesn't look like I can actually purchase an option on FMCCH but I'd still like to understand the scenario. "
2021-07-03 00:00:00,stocks,"Schlumberger and halliburton The meeting with OPEC yesterday proved that they still are favoring higher oil prices and will (probably,) produce 400k bpd from August until December. I did see an article that said there were some disagreements in the cartel, which signals they MAY NOT ramp up production at all, but I think we will see they stick to the 400 bpd they seemed to agree on yesterday.

I think this OPEC meeting signaled that crude is going to have an opportunity to leg up again, as US shale is not in a place to compete, giving OPEC control of the market for another few months. I believe $80 Brent is going to be here before the summer is over and ITM calls for 3-6 months out will be fairly easy money. These stocks have already seen significant runs up, but have not kept up pace with the rise of crude oil. 

Schlumberger and halliburton are both in a position to do well following this OPEC news. I did not buy shares, instead chose to buy slightly otm calls for 6 months out. 

am big on Exxon, but as inventories deplete, I believe we will see more gains on the services side of things rather than refiners and producers. I still am long shares/calls Exxon, Devon and Suncor though. 

I do still like the pipelines, mainly enbridge as well. The OIH is also a fantastic way to play this, but the options are very expensive which I believe signals the upside risk of near term crude volatility."

These people have never contributed, yet drive up the cost of houses and take money which could go to people who are in genuine need of unemployment support.

2021-07-03 09:07:22,stocks,"Even if pay scales with location, you can still make good money working remote. The scale isn't that dramatic of a falloff.

Example: I live in Houston, work remotely. The adjustment down to my locality is about 10% from the Bay Area. It's an additional 25% cut if I were to move to Iowa. Pay in Iowa is about 65% of what it is in the bay area, 90% in Texas of what it is in the bay area. 

I obviously come ahead because Houston is relatively cheap for Texas and they're assuming I'm living in Austin when they pay Texas rates, but the difference in salary doesn't fully match the difference in COL, so workers still come out ahead to work remote."

2021-07-03 13:46:03,stocks,"Personally, I invested in EDIT. Together with CRSP, NTLA and BEAM it has had a run lately, however, EDIT is still the most undervalued of these. There is a possible catalyst in September as they release the data of their EDIT-101 trials. There are optimism around this trial as they have released the names of the persons in the trial, which seems weird if the resultst were not *at least* somewhat positive. Rumors are that vision was restored to the point of being able to see a bar on a piece of paper, and if this is true, it is a promising start.  

I have not researched the others in depth, as I found that EDIT seemingly was most undervalued by far, which I found appealing. From what I've seen, BEAM has the most promising type of gene editing technology, while CRISPR is further in terms of having a usable service. 

I honestly would have invested in both BEAM and CRISPR too, but now that they've taken off I'll wait for them to hopefully cool off. 

Hope this helps you with regard to making a decision."
2021-07-03 19:27:40,stocks,"Are you in the US?  If so then:

The most common place people start investing in the market is with a company 401K.  Do you have one of those?  

The next option is to open a Brokerage account.  Fidelity, Vanguard, and Charles Schwab are free and popular.  There are other as well for experienced traders, but I would stick with one of the big three for now.

One popular strategy is to buy a S&P500 ETF.  For example you can open a Vanguard account and purchase VOO that is a very low fee ETF that allows you to own the 500 companies at one time. 

Doing so will form a great basis for your portfolio as you learn about trading, how to research stocks, develop a risk profile, and clarify your goals.  There is nothing wrong with your first 100K to go right into VOO."

Also if someone is buying new macs with 32gb for the purpose of running windows, then that is severe mismanagement of funding. You can expect whoever made that decision to get fired.

In what way?

>I never said anything about 32GB Mac so that point is moot also. Where did you get that from? 

Sorry, I misread your OP. But a laptop with 32gb of storage (not RAM) is probably 20+ years old. It's okay to throw away laptops that old lol.

I HIGHLY doubt these were a quarter million dollars worth of laptops, unless you had 15,000+ of these

You sound like you're shilling heavy for Microsoft at this point. Even 8.1 ran better and had plenty of free space. 

Blind faith to replace devices with no justification, that's laziness. Instead of fixing the problem just upgrade and buy new, that's the Mac/Apple culture right there. Don't fix, just replace, buy. We've gone full circle."

Sure, but this should be common knowledge if you work in tech:


1. Newer software is more demanding than older software


2. Newer hardware is better than older software




That means that newer software pairs better with newer software. This is why organizations should not be issuing 20 year old laptops when you expect your staff to use modern software.

Do you think GTA5 takes up less install space than GTA1? Nope, it's the opposite


10 years ago 4GB RAM was the standard. Today it is 16GB. As a result, newer software has been developed to take advantage of the additional memory to give you better performance.

Runs great on minimal settings and low disk space.

The only reason 16GB is the standard is because Google Chrome takes up 8GB just browsing and is a memory hog. I'll tell ya one game I like that's a memory hog, it's called Just Cause 3. I love that game, but you'll need 16GB of ram to play it. Pathetically inefficient, but I love it to pieces."

That leaves one menu item that I really look forward to eating, out of maybe 30.  Well, I guess the avocado toast isn't bad either.  :)  The only real reason I would go to Dunkin is for the coffee, which is decent.

My old hometown still has 2 local donut bakeries hanging on despite the chains.  At either place, their donuts taste far, far better than either of the chains.

It crashes cause the business shut down after the government made them. The U.S. has too many vaccinations now for the government to react to covid with a shutdown. Biden already said there will be no more lockdowns. Not that he's in charge of it, but the main reason they did so easily before was to get rid of fat guy. There's about no chance they shutdown anything now that they are in power. Just like the country didn't shutdown under Obama with H1N1 with 61 million infected and 274,000 hospitalizations. Anyway, if covid comes back it will mostly impact other countries that don't have the vaccines and protections in place. This might hurt the world economy, but problem is when there is a world crisis the money will flow into the United States market as a safe haven. No, the risk to the market is actually after covid goes away and things return to normal. Covid is and has always propped up the market to new highs. The only thing that hurt the market was forced business shutdown which causes a liquidity crisis cause businesses had their reserve capital in corporate bonds which they couldn't sell to anyone during a panic. That's why the Fed has to step in to be the buyer. That's why currently we are in a ""Goldilocks"" environment, cause we are right in in-between covid reduction and reopening. So you get the best of both worlds, massive spending from covid stimulus spending and companies open for business. It's basically a planned economy with massive central bank spending that guarantees an outcome. Once covid is gone and stimulus is gone, whenever or if ever, then the market will be in some hurt."

I also started diversifying International as much as possible. I noticed that recently International has a drop so good chance to buy in. Crisis normally hits other countries first before it comes crashing down our shores. US situation right now is similar to a kid stuffing toys down the toilet and once something is stuck, all the shits gonna come out and you gonna get owned.  


However, with some skepticism, I still recommend to hedge your bets and stay invested rather than completely pull out. The reason why pulling out might be even more foolish is because of all these money printing and trillion dollars of stimulus causing your money to lose value faster than you think.  


There are also nothing else to invest in, let's see:  


Cash: worthless  


Real Estates: an even bigger bubble than the stock market  


Virtual Currency: look into tether scandal, it gonna blow up this speculative market  


Gold & Silver: the price movements look heavily manipulated. Inflation shoots through the roof and price of these metals go down or flat  


Bond: with 0.00001% interest rate ? Fuck that

In fact, I think what you are doing is dismissing people concerns of a crash with Fed policy. What happens is people all see a crash coming and talk about said crash incoming, but then the Fed takes actions based on the concerns and the crash is delayed. That doesn't mean the crash talk was wrong or people shouldn't be discussing it. Just acknowledge the Fed is kicking the can down the road and there will be more justified crash talk later."

2021-07-03 06:35:02,stocks,"So there was no American retirement system from March 2000 to March 2013? Cause S&P was 1534 in March 2000 and S&P was 1534 in March 2013. Sounds like a bear market to me.

S&P was 1850 in 2016, so it moved +20% after 16 years?

S&P was 2190 in 2020, so it moved +43% after 20 years?

If that's not a long term bear market, then what is? From S&P 1534 in 2000 to S&P 2190 in 2020 over 20 years, that's an annualized rate of 1.9% return. You made +43% in 20 years, you do realized the cumulative dollar inflation rate from 2000 to 2020 was 50.3%?? So you actually lost lots of money in the S&P over 20 years versus inflation. But, no long term bear market ever again. LOL!

You do realize I could have just bought a 30 year Treasury bond in 2000 and made 5.94% a year versus 1.9% from the S&P over the same period? That's simple math, and exactly why they want to keep rates low and destroy the bond market cause you'd easily beat the S&P with a bond with this crooked system unless they forced money out of bonds into the stock market with artificially low rates.

Just look at the 2020 performance. Pick a bond fund, TLT (20 yr Treasurys) did 17.92% in 2020 which is basically considered risk free, and SPY did 18.25% in 2020 with as much risk as you can handle. Which was smarter? (Risking your life savings in a wild casino, right?)

In fact, market timing was the only sane way to go. If you couldn't tell the market was cheaper in 2002 and 2009 relative to other times, and the market was expensive in 2000 and 2008, then you had to be mental. Can you time the exact day? no, but what does that matter. The real problem is that it takes patience to wait, and people don't want to do that over time spans of years. They just want to put their money in automatically and not have to think. Why do you think the market swings up and down so wildly? Market timing. People are selling and buying.

North Korea alone reported 0 cases.). On top of that, all the millions of A&E and cancer and cardio & organ deaths that couldn't be treated. We ended up only 10% of the world population being infected last year and still hospitals being almost totally overwhelmed and running out of resources.

A lot of people also chose to save more and invest money, so there is a lot more of it going after those shares.

The US govt and the citizens would be ruined by interest if the rates went back to 4% or wherever they used to be before 2008, so I don't see a return to that in the near future - the Fed is sort of forced to use the other tools at its disposal. 1-2% interest rates really aren't bad for stocks, so I think we continue to see enough growth before the next big crash that it justifies being in the market than on the sidelines."

Total nonsense. Why do you people have to come to online forums and spout lies?

1. Absent hospitals the fatality rate of original covid trended towards the hospitalisation rate of 20%. In Wuhan it took the resources of a huge country dumped into a single city to bring the death rate down to just 5%. 

2. The current lower rate of >2% globally is based on better  availability of knowledge of the virus, steroid treatments and ventilators and medical staff.  https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/    (4 million / 184 million = >2%. Both deaths and cases are underreported)

3. The death rate in Taiwan - **which is primarily delta cases** without vaccination but with excellent access to hospitals and knowledge and medicines and doctors**- is 5%**.

1. Age is FAR more protective than vaccines against being symptomatic for transmission, against falling sick and against dying. For example a person age 50 unvaccinated has about the same odds of death or ill health as a fully vaccinated 80 year old.  

2. More than 50% of the Indian population are under 25. 65% of Indians are under 35. The median age in India is 27.  In short, more than two thirds of the indian population is prone to having almost practically no problems at all with covid except an unlucky 1 in 1000. The USA's average age is over 38. Germany and Japan's average age is 46. 

3. The USA and Europe are far more interconnected in terms of rapid travel / seeding of disease. The seeded cases in india were largely spread by specific, annual / multi-annual pilgrimage type events.

4. I am unsure when exactly delta arose in India and what % were already immunised by previous strains.

In short, look what happened in India with a population that's mostly immobile and 20 years younger than the average Japanese or German person. It's been a fucking shitshow.

I don't need to go short as well. Why would I? Cash is great. It gives me huge amounts of optionality to buy into a cheaper market, a housing crash, a bond crash or whatever. Opportunity to move to another country if living costs become far cheaper there. It costs me nothing to hold other than a slow drip of inflation, so I have time and opportunity on my side vs. a range of instruments & markets.

Microsoft in the 1990s was the most valuable company in the world switching spots with GE, it is currently the only company that was in the top 10 list in 1990 and is currently still top 10 right now (at #2 spot behind apple).

Moreover, It has never fallen out of the top 10 list for more than 20+ years even with failure of Ballmer, tech bubble crash, Nokia, etc. Now with the new ceo, I dont see it going out of the top 10 especially since it is so far ahead from #10 spot which is Nvidia at 500 billion market cap. (Microsoft is worth 2.1 trillion).

Back in the 1990s #1 spot had 200 billion valuation compared to 100 billion for #10 spot. So now the Top 5 companies are much more valuable compared to the bottom 5 of the list. Unlike the 1990s the top companies were not investing to the future and focus on short term profits.

Microsoft continues to invest in the future with the cloud technology, ai, vr/ar tech as well as is extremely diversified with equal 33% weight in 3 different classified segments.(the other trillion companies aren't as diversified). Finally, it is one of two companies (other being JNJ) with triple AAA credit rating, higher than the US government. It faces less regulatory risk than tech giants competitors allowing for easy acquisitions thanks to its stellar balance sheet."

2021-07-03 14:15:03,stocks,"Comparing the fundamentals of BABA to the FAANG stocks as justification for BABA's undervalued-ness is the completely WRONG approach. BABA is disconnected from its fundamentals for very good reasons. The stocks do not represent real ownership of the company. The CCP will have no hesitation to commandeer foreign investor's stock ownership if they feel it beneficial to do so. 

The DIDI IPO is but one recent example of how the CCP has no issue reminding chinese companies who the real owners are. Hint: it's not the company's management; and it's certainly not the company's investors, foreign or domestic. 

People outside of China don't realize how nationalistic the country and the populace is currently becoming. A glimpse of that nationalism can be seen in Xi's recent speech, echoing the sentiment that China will never suffer another Century of Humiliation. Due to Chinese weak position over the last century, the current generation of Chinese has not gone through a period of flexing its military muscle in pursuit of territorial expansion, unlike the West, so it has not experienced the painful lessons that Western countries has engaging in expensive militarism. **A non-negligible part of the Chinese public, I am sorry to say, is clamoring for payback for the Century of Humiliation. This should greatly worry all foreign investors. Their investment will be the first in the line of fire between a potential conflict (economic or otherwise) between the West and China.** 

Yes, Charlie Munger and some the other wise investors and all that. I am sorry but I think Charlie and many Western investors do not appreciate the danger of the Chinese psyche of this century. Again, China has to take capitalism more seriously, respect shareholders' control and not view Chinese companies as fattened pigs waiting to be slaughtered for me to consider investing in these companies. An authorization of buyback and dividends will be a good start. Until then, it looks to me that Chinese companies want the benefit of the foreign capital market without the responsibility. As such, *caveat emptor.*"

2021-07-03 14:33:45,stocks,"The recent interference of CCP into DIDI should tell investors that these ""old"" reasons are very much still an ongoing concern. Fundamentals mean nothing if there is a real chance FCF will never be returned to investors."

2021-07-02 20:33:12,stocks,If you're that confident in it going down short it m8
2021-07-02 20:41:31,stocks,"When did I even say it's going down ace? I'm talking about how its impossible to go to 500k, the whole 500k shit is a trap to lure dumb investors into the stock to boost shareholders positions. AMC will go up, but not past a hundred or a couple hundred dollars a share. And when that happens, it will tank hard. We've seen it, we know how squeezes work. If you hold past the squeeze, you're a fool. You'll be left bagholding. Know your exit stragedy and prepare."
