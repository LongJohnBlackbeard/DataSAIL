2021-05-20 19:49:02,stocks,"Solar, wind, hydro are the dirtiest ""green energy"" that exist. The amount of carbon burned to extract the material they need from the earth, and their efficiency defeats the purpose.

Nuclear ETF/Tesla is the way."
2021-05-20 19:53:07,stocks,Tesla is somewhat solar too dude. A little contradictory there

You will see at the bottom of these articles that Oilprice.com owns shares and will not disclose when they will sell them. Pumping and then dumping shares. If you have seen any excited articles on any website there is a good chance you will see that disclaimer at the bottom.

The price is aligned with a rough valuation of 850/acre of proven acreage based on its stage of exploration. As the news provides more positive results it moves in that direction. I encourage you to go to Reconnaissance Africa sub and look at the actual DD. While I agree there are hype posts, there is actually very legitimate research done very thoroughly.

2021-05-20 19:28:08,stocks,"Congrats. My recommendation, choose Fidelity."
2021-05-20 18:56:13,stocks,I use TD and have no complaints. Congrats on making good moves at 27🤙
2021-05-20 19:00:20,stocks,Td ameritrade is great. Amazing platform and customer service. Message me for a referral invite and we both get money
2021-05-20 19:42:54,stocks,I think my choice of broker will be based on what type of fund is best to put inside a Roth IRA.
2021-05-20 19:47:13,stocks,I use M1 Finance. Love the pie structure of the portfolio. Set it and forget it type of account
2021-05-20 18:50:17,stocks,"Target date funds are the way I went, specifically the Fidelity 2050 Target date fund."

I still maintain accounts in Growth, Growth and income, aggressive growth, and international."
2021-05-20 19:40:34,stocks,Any specific type of funds thru fidelity I should stay away from or look for to put inside a Roth IRA. Mutual vs ETF vs index.
2021-05-20 19:36:14,stocks,Why TD versus say fidelity / vanguard / etc. Is it better to put actively managed funds in a Roth IRA instead of passive's ? I read that TD has great actively managed funds so that's why I asked
2021-05-20 19:50:24,stocks,"M1 is another option I keep hearing, I may need to see this pie structure everyone keeps boasting"
2021-05-20 19:51:35,stocks,IMO target dates suck because of their high bond allocation. Much better to just do the fidelity S&P 500 fund and then move some into bonds when you are 50
2021-05-20 19:38:13,stocks,"I have a target date fund in my 401k thru my employer. I'm thinking of trying a different type of fund / funds. How are Fidelities zero funds, are they any good for Roth's"
2021-05-20 19:55:04,stocks,"Yes, Fidelity. Mutual funds charge fees. That’s dumb. Go with indexes. And yes, Fidelity will let you buy individual stocks. Also options, but don’t ask me how I know. I don’t like to talk about it."
2021-05-20 19:46:44,stocks,"I have a ROTH IRA with Fidelity. Since I already had a regular IRA with them, the Roth took about 3 minutes to open.  
I did not know this until after I opened my Roth, but Fidelity let's you buy individual stocks, if you want."
2021-05-20 19:52:55,stocks,"It’s great. Set individual stocks/ETFs to your desired allocation percentage and when you deposit money, it buys based on getting each slice of the pie to your target percentage. If that makes sense."
2021-05-20 19:59:49,stocks,Do you have to open a brokerage account seperate to the Roth IRA to buy individual stocks or can you buy them inside your Roth account
2021-05-20 19:54:43,stocks,That's wicked convenient. Every broker should have that feature.
2021-05-20 18:31:52,stocks,The platform wouldn’t allow you to make more than one order.
2021-05-20 18:41:36,stocks,I believe you can create OTO orders. One Cancels the Other to enable you to set a sell high and the other to sell low (huge unexpected dip)
2021-05-20 18:35:22,stocks,"Are you asking if both limit orders are sell orders?  Or is one is a buy and one is a sell?

If both orders are sell orders then it will trigger the sale when it hits 101.5 or 100.5 whichever is first and likely cancel or show an error with the other since you no longer have any shares.

If you set a limit BUY order at 100.5 and a limit SELL order 101.5?  If that’s the case it will sell your one share when it hits 101.5 and buy you one share (or however many you put in the buy order) at 100.5 since the buy order is not contingent on you owning shares. These could happen in any order. 

I’m not an expert though so please if I’m off base someone correct me."
2021-05-20 19:41:08,stocks,On etrade you could only do this example with 2 shares. It won't even let you set up the second limit sell
2021-05-20 19:14:29,stocks,Thank-you so much. The trailing stop loss order is what I needed.
2021-05-20 19:33:49,stocks,I learnt about trailing stop order. I think that is What i wanted to do anyway.
2021-05-20 18:37:43,stocks,I was asking about both sell orders.
2021-05-20 19:08:16,stocks,Yeah then whichever hits first will sell and the other should get cancelled.
2021-05-20 18:13:30,stocks,"Depends. Yes, theta decay. No. No."
2021-05-20 18:57:44,stocks,"Familiarize yourself with the term ""IV crush"" and its implications. It is the bane of new options traders."
2021-05-20 18:46:00,stocks,"call options aren't so black and white. let's break this down:

>Now let’s say it goes up to $700 way before January. How much profit do you make?

A lot. It's impossible to calculate cause it matters when it happens, how quickly it happens, and how much above 700. But yes, if you buy a 590C today and tsla skyrockets to 700 by next month, you'll make a decent amount of profit. However, if tesla skyrockets to 700 then trades sideways until jan 2022, that profit will slowly get killed by theta

> Do you lose more the closer it gets?

Yes, this is called theta decay. Think of it as how likely it is for a call to reach the strike. If you have a 590 strike for tomorrow and another for jan of 2022, theta will decay much faster for tomorrow's call cause it's much less likely to hit 590 vs hitting 590 in jan 2022.


> Also is the break even price exactly how it sounds? So if it’s $697 break even, I would only profit after $697?

The breakeven is a misleading statistic because it only matters on day of expiration. If your b/e is 697, it means on day of expiration, if tesla is below 697, you'll lose money on your initial purchase. however, tesla can be at 697 way before your call expires and you'll make a profit."
2021-05-20 19:53:17,stocks,"I disagree a little with Sid. In a toppy market where we are now... Calls can be a nice bridge to get over rough water.

Example... A high growth, high PE stock like DraftKings... Been down 25% recently, in a slow rev quarter... It will trend up as NFL football kicks up... So buying say October calls is a pretty good bet. 

Definitely start slow and anticipate losing %50 with your first few trades. It can be a wild ride. Options swing heavily. Good luck."

2021-05-20 19:09:24,stocks,"Step one. Don’t buy options they are a 40% trade at best. 
Step two. Learn spreads and premium selling strats. These are 60% to 80% trades (you’re the house not the gambler) This is where the steady money is made."
2021-05-20 17:59:43,stocks,"Target's an interesting pandemic case in that it's shot up like crazy - it's up almost 100% from pre-crash prices - but still manages to trade below 20 p/e.

I doubt they'll be able to maintain the same level of growth post-pandemic but I also think consumer sentiment is gonna be on their side for a while (unless they fuck something up), and they had been on a solid upward trend for a few years even before covid."
2021-05-20 18:11:17,stocks,"I am in a similar boat! Bought in a few years ago due to strong fundamentals, it’s been a fun ride.

I’m a classic valuations guy - this market raises a lot of eyebrows for me. So it’s great to see a company that I thought was underpriced turn into a winner without getting overvalued!"
2021-05-20 17:58:03,stocks,I agree with you but i got some july puts juuuuust in case. Long TGT shares.
2021-05-20 18:37:01,stocks,Bought in Q1'19 around 65.  Still holding with no plans to sell.
2021-05-20 18:06:05,stocks,"I’m very curious to see that. It’s hard to believe they could double their value year over year so I definitely expect growth to slow. But at the same time I think there’s a lot left in the tank. The invest in themselves very well. They crushed same day pick-up and using their stores as pseudo warehouses. Their brand partnerships are great and their target brand groceries are both really good and popular.

I think Target occupies a very special niche of value and chic. Loyal customers. Great business model. And so I don’t bet against continued future growth, even given the huge run up over the past 12 months or so"
2021-05-20 18:14:29,stocks,Love to hear this kind of success story!
2021-05-20 18:44:55,stocks,"Beautiful! I first bought in a little later in 2019 and added a couple times to my position. Also not planning on selling. Every time I added to my position I was a little hesitant since it increased my cost basis, but it was so worth it every time"
2021-05-20 18:15:54,stocks,"Yeah, a PEG below 2 does brook confidence.

Target's definitely been stepping up their store/exclusive brands over the last few years (my wife is loving some of the new ELF brand stuff), and their push for inclusivity and paying their workers well can only be long-term fuel for sentiment and loyalty.

I only have 15 shares currently but their continuing strong results have me strongly considering scaling up."
2021-05-20 19:19:35,stocks,Agreed.  My only complaint so far is that I didn't buy more at that price.
2021-05-20 18:18:38,stocks,I think a lot of people are getting scared by the run up. But the thing is the company is strong so the uptrend can very well continue. I remember talking to someone towards the end of last year who didn’t want to buy because he felt $175 was too expensive. And now here we are. Price targets keep getting revised up so o think there is a real case to be made that there’s no time to buy like the present
2021-05-20 19:38:50,stocks,"Haha amen! That’s the hardest part about buying above the initial cost. But like I said in another comment, once you get over that it is so worth it. Even my last purchase buying around $165 feels extremely worthwhile now"
2021-05-20 18:23:44,stocks,Let 'em get scared. The price is currently more than justified by their earnings so any selloff is just an opportunity to load up. Be greedy when others are fearful and all.
2021-05-20 18:27:44,stocks,100% agree
2021-05-20 18:53:13,stocks,"Any other pandemic winners that are still undervalued in your eyes?

My big one is ALLY."
2021-05-20 18:59:47,stocks,"CVS and AZN would be my other 2. CVS just started catching up to it’s true value in my opinion. I think it’s got great fundamentals and a solid growth track. The vaccines get people in the door and build brand familiarity. From there they get repeat business, Aetna gets fed and they get more opportunities to build out their minute clinic model.

AZN got beat up so badly for the vaccine news. In no world is any pharma company making big money off the vaccines. So the stock got depressed off nothing news. Meanwhile they completed the Alexion merger which I think will be huge down the line. They also keep rolling out successful and actually profitable drugs. A year or two down the line I think they see big gains"
2021-05-20 19:00:23,stocks,I’m a little prejudiced in my financials lol I am very heavy JPM. Decent position in MS. For my smaller financial I like ISBC
2021-05-20 19:01:14,stocks,Is there anything in particular that makes you like CVS over WBA?
2021-05-20 19:37:47,stocks,Biggest thing is Aetna. Other than that I like the minute clinic model they are building. To me WBA feels more like a retail focus and CVS feels more like a healthcare focus
2021-05-20 17:31:04,stocks,"If you would like to combine oil and gas with a push to renewables, you could have a look especially at European ones.

RDSA, Equinor, Eni, BP or Total could be of interest to you.

In general, European oil companies have been investing a lot more money into renewables than their American counterparts. Although the success of the investments is still a mixed bag so far.

2021-05-20 17:49:30,stocks,"Most of the major players peaked in 2014 and have been trending downward since. Alternatives are only getting cheaper, more efficient, and more accessible.

However, prices haven't hit pre-pandemic levels and demand is likely to increase in the short term as reopening reignites travel and shipping, and they typically have strong dividend payments.

Long term I would call it a losing bet (10 years ago, XOM was the biggest company by market cap, now it's not even top 10), but there's still money to be made."

The real question is will they grow. Not sure of that answer, but I do use oil and gas to diversify my portfolio. Right now they’re a tad bit expensive and I suspect summer reopenings are priced in, it may not be the best time to open a large position unless you want to hold for a while and collect divvies. It may also be a great time because a lot of them are nowhere near ATHs."

2021-05-20 19:36:04,stocks,"Oil and Gas companies will be around for a long time yet, and I don’t think current prices are the new peak, but that doesn’t mean they are a necessarily great long term investment. They are cyclical in the best of times, and as you call out there’s a growing negative stigma that means they’ll probably always be a bit undervalued by classic metrics going forward. I’d only buy now with a short term exit plan in place unless you’re buying for the dividend."

2021-05-20 16:44:52,stocks,"There’s a couple things to consider:
1) Expectations for earnings beats may already be factored in to a stocks current price. Has the stock run up before earnings? That’s a good indicator that a beat is expected.
2) Guidance, guidance, guidance. A stock valuation is based on future cash flows. If the guidance is lower than expected, then usually it doesn’t matter if earnings were a beat - the stock is going down"
2021-05-20 16:42:21,stocks,"Market these days has been just crazy so I wouldn’t draw too many conclusions.

However, a company can report good earnings but investors generally are looking for future guidance. A beat on earnings and miss on guidance could take the stock down. But this is me over simplifying."
2021-05-20 19:36:50,stocks,"This isn't some sort of new phenomena. There are good earnings cycles and bad ones. This has been going on forever. Market sentiment plays a huge role in the short term and it always has. 

In some cycles, earnings need to really impress to drive stocks higher. This is one of those cycles. Look at what TTWO has done the last two days, it's not like every stock is going down."

2021-05-20 16:39:15,stocks,"I think it depends on what the company does, additional information like insider compensation, a weaker balance sheet is still possible if there’s new debt which is also on the reports as well if the stock is one targeted by scalpers looking to make a quick buck.

I don’t think that in itself is an indicator of anything.

Plus if big institutions wanted to move money in secret and they were being super shady like that they could always just use a dark pool or other means to do it without drawing attention by affecting prices.

However the market could be in a bubble right now, highly probable, but I don’t think share price after earnings is a reliable indicator."
2021-05-20 16:46:10,stocks,"The real truth is earnings have limited benefit when assessing future financial performance and company healthy. The guidance, industry and overall market sentiment are all important too. And of course earnings can always be priced in.

Just two quick counter examples to show that stock price is not always totally detached from earnings performance. CVS and TGT both had great earnings recently and both stocks jumped significantly.

This isn't the rats running out before a disaster, that's how the market works.

Way too much."

this is the equivalent of a consistently A student saying he's going to get an A on the next test. if he gets an A, are you going to go WOW THIS IS SO UNEXPECTED? no, you'll be like ok cool, you did what you said you would.

now, if you had a D student say he was going to get an A on his next test, sure you might be surprised by the announcement but over time, you'll probably forget. But then, if he actually manages to pull off an A, you'll be completely shocked and probably reward him well. Meeting expectations is the bare minimum. A surprise factor is needed for a great earnings to push a stock price. If you want to include guidance, it would be that D student saying for the next 5 tests, I'll be getting an A, which previously he had never said before."
2021-05-20 17:34:25,stocks,"I think there's a few reasons, earnings have been baked in, people over estimated the effects of COVID on earnings early on and slashed businesses, without understanding that losing short-term money while the long-term industry is in tact, will result in little change in future cash flows (assuming no bankruptcy/ not overleveraged). 

Company guidance matters, if they say they expect growth to slow or not grow as fast, they're getting dumped whether you like it or not."

I do think we’ll see a healthy deflation in home prices and an increase in supply. There will be some economic damage, but we (as a society, not the individual folks and families that are suffering) may actually appreciate the outcome because right now home prices are soaring and demand is far exceeding supply.

Buying a house right now is like buying stocks in Feb, is what I’m saying.

I'm only expecting a minor correction. This boom is fueled by people's desire to live in a house, not by unethical lending practices.

If you buy a 1M house in the middle of nowhere, you'll likely sell it at a loss in five years, but if you buy a 1M in a desirable location, you'll likely be able to sell it for a profit in five years.

Renting in HCOL cities will be more attractive after the pandemic, but remote work is here to stay. People like houses."

After that I would pay off any debts you have.

For the investing portion, i would personally recommend staying away from day trading or any types of swing trades. Best advice is the most boring: index funds. VTI covers the whole US market, it’s not exciting, but it has proven that over time it is the most consistent with returns. I don’t know your timeframe, so if you want to pull it out in 10 years, or anything sooner than retirement, put it in a normal brokerage account. If you really don’t need the money, place it in a Roth IRA and relax when you retire.

Hope this helps!"

It was with Charles Schwab and the very first stocks I bought were IBM and Chi-Chi's (mexican restaurant chain). IBM sat for about a decade before I sold it off, Chi-Chi's crashed and burned. Went through the various market crashes, 2008 was especially bad. Down 39% on that one. I've done very well overall, though after I hit a couple of big targets portfolio-value wise, I basically handed over my accounts to my financial planner. I retired at 52, started a little business with my wife (record store and pop culture stuff), did that for almost a decade and then moved to Florida. I feel we've built sufficient net worth, and liquid assets, to see us through about 25 more years, though not likely we'll live that long.  Other than the stuff being managed for me, I've got a nice 'play' account, mostly full of weed stocks right now. Biggest mistake has always been one of patience - I tend to get in too late and out too early. My longest held stock is EBAY, which I've had since 2005, so while I've had accounts for >30 years, I don't own anything that's just been sitting there for all that time."

2021-05-20 15:33:02,stocks,"I’m not sure this applies if I adjusted my portfolio within the time period, but at 24 years, I am at about 120% ROI. 

TLDR:  pick companies you know, understand biz model and try to form scenarios on when you buy or sell, try not to time the market. Don’t panic sell. 

I have a “play account” where I trade more often and TBH, just having stable companions like P&G, Amazon, Financials like MET, V, I’ve done probably better with the long-term portfolio. 

Learned to be disciplined and really understand the company business model. Going off the hypothesis of their model has helped me stay disciplined where when the market would crash, I would buy incrementally more. 

I also would set goals for myself and if something got to a target ROI, I’d take some off the top. That has left me leaving $ on the table, which sucked, but my losses haven’t been as drastic. 

Mistakes I have made have included:
1.  Getting into an IPO on the first days. It’s not worth it to chase the hype. SNAP went to $26 and then to $12 for a long time. It’s okay to have patience because things do go down. 
2.  Selling tesla at $28 and happy with a $6 gain because I didn’t think something propped up by subsidies could do well. I love the cars, don’t like the volatility, but should’ve held on. 
3.  Biotech. I’m just not good at understanding the model and fda trials, and predictions. I stay far away because I get burned every time.

In my own individual trades, my gambles and bets have far and away been my best trades.  It is certainly possible to find those trades from time to time.  In particular in growth/speculation stocks.

I let professional money managers manage my nest egg.  They get consistent returns and they manage to mostly avoid the big drops.  I have my own account where I speculate.

In retrospect I am almost always wrong about why I get 5x returns from a stock.  For example my last stock to get those returns was PLUG.  I thought they were a good company with a promising technology.  In retrospect it was a pump and dump, and their CEO is a good con man, who leveraged his relationship with Chuck Schumer in his pump and dump scheme.

I make no claims at being a genius investor or anything like that.  Only that it is possible to make a living as a retail investor."

2021-05-20 15:14:16,stocks,Lol same price point here. So sick of seeing it in my portfolio
2021-05-20 15:30:24,stocks,"Heres my opinion. Small caps inherently have more room to grow than large caps, it's much easier to go from 500 million to 1 billion than from 500 billion to 1 trillion.

However, most small cap stocks won't be around in the future/won't have seen that exponential growth. I think it's much more likely that MSFT, AAPL etc stick around and continue to grow vs a much smaller startup company that might go bankrupt.

But also, there are very likely a few small cap stocks out there that are genuinely good companies that WILL outperform large caps if all goes well. I think in general, well established companies with long history have more trust and are much safer. The majority, or at least a lot of the small cap stocks don't have that going for them. However, the few small caps that are able to grow, scale and earn a reputation will likely grow at a faster rate than the biggest market cap stocks.

To summarize: Small cap stocks can grow faster but most of them likely won't. There are probably a few winners here and there but those are the exception. My 2 cents"
2021-05-20 15:33:32,stocks,"Great points, would you think the big winners would make up a large enough % of the small cap companies to overall outperform large caps or just not enough that they would still trail cap size to cap size?"
2021-05-20 16:03:19,stocks,"Historically, yes small-caps as a whole do outperform large-caps as a whole. This is called the small-cap risk premium. Some studies recently have found that it's not as large as it was once thought to be but it's still there, if you remove small-cap growth and only focus on small-cap value then the premium becomes pretty big.

2021-05-20 16:17:36,stocks,"Are you asking because you want to invest in a general small cap fund? I'm not sure, but as the other reply states it looks like they do. But, I'm not sure if that knowledge matters unless you want to invest in a general fund covering smaller cap stocks, or unless you have a good idea as to who the winners would be. The reason many people avoid small cap speculative stocks is because they haven't built up their history and reputation, so there is inherently more risk as well as more potential reward. So while there might end up being a few winners, the majority of people who invest in small cap stocks will still get burned because of the sheer number of losers as well.

I am an investor who tends to try and look for small cap stocks that, given a long enough outlook, will outperform larger cap companies and I can tell you just one thing. It's not easy, and it's a whole lot of speculation. But I enjoy speculating, so there you go."

The analysis stated it was overbought, there was a tremendous amount of inflow over outflow but the price action was continuously dropping, stagnating, dropping, stagnating. Every fiber in my body tells me this is backwards, Inflow to what? the darkpool?  because when that kind of inflow is happening the price is climbing, it's basic math, common logic!!!! When I'm searching for quick plays and I see increasing volume and upward price momentum, I see the RSI is trending towards 70-80 meaning overbought and the inflow percentages are larger than the outflow the Price Action is climbing, not descending. That is normal market activity."
2021-05-20 14:40:03,stocks,"What inflow/outflow data are you looking at?

Edit: by definition there are exactly as many shares bought each day as sold each day - you can’t just sell shares if there isn’t someone on the other side to buy it.

When you think of an order book you think of depth.... there are 100k people willing to sell at the current price, 125k one cent below current price, 150k 2 cents below that... etc. so if there are less shares on the bid than the ask then 10k shares sold will have more of a market impact than 10k shares bot"
2021-05-20 13:43:21,stocks,"Thank you. After reading that I have one more question. If the outflow is much lower than the inflow, would that not be the same as higher demand with lower supply as less people are willing to sell that want to buy? Which would make the price go up, not down?"

If I have 3 cars and 10 people want to buy them, the total transaction is 3 cars. But if it’s a rich area and people are willing to pay $100,000 for them just because they can.

In one scenario the 3 cars make me $3600.

In the other scenario 3 cars make me $300,000.

Works both ways.

2021-05-20 14:14:20,stocks,"Supply and demand are the main drivers. But just inflow and outflow don’t necessarily gauge the actual demand.

If one person sells a million shares but 12 million people want to buy the dip but just haven’t yet that doesn’t mean that there is a negative demand on that day. The demand is still the same.

So the two are related but they aren’t correlated in a linear way."
2021-05-20 14:21:27,stocks,"I should also add that previous transactions on the same day change demand. As the chart rises demand goes down because people think “I’ll wait until it drops back down.”

As the chart drops down it increases demand because people think “oh I’ll buy the dip.”

The above is true if overall sentiment toward a stock is positive. The opposite applies if overall sentiment is negative."

2021-05-20 18:16:00,stocks,"Though this is clearly a protective play by Ford, folks need to realize the scale we are talking about it and extrapolate the meaning. F sells a lot of cars. Thus, their focus isnt necessarily more sales, its margins and it will take very little change in margin, to move the bar. 

The reason for that is their margins are historically thin. But that also means that even a slight improvement, of say 2-3% in net, would push the stock to double if they can just maintain that for a couple of years. This is all they need to do. So the question you need to ask is will eV's increase margins? And if so, by how much?

Historically, ICE margins are very small and most companies today are lucky to see 5%. So a change of 2-3% is huge. See what I mean? Its not like a startup which has to show 30%-50% rev growth for 10 years straight.

I think the switch to eV's will definitely increase margins. At first it will be slight but the margins will grow every year for the next decade and they will grow by a lot, to the tune of maybe 1% per year as sales increase. I also think that due to Fords legacy in trucks, they will be able to command a premium to everyone else thanks to 3rd party support, ease of repair, and low cost of ownership. 

I also think that in time, fleets management software will indeed become a major thing. As we move more and more to online shopping, efficient delivery will become insanely critical as Amazon has pointed out time and time again. Thus there will be enterprise software profits to be made for those that have a lot of vehicles in the enterprise space... which is likely going to be Ford though Rivian currently has a nice path with Amazon specifically right now. But Ford owns a bug chunk of Rivian too so lol."

The margins will be much much worse on the EV, they may in fact be losing money for several years initially on them. They may have an opportunity to split off the EV company on its own or something to survive, we'll see."

2021-05-20 15:17:34,stocks,"Ok I was also invested in Ford for a bit, but I sold because I had one big concern, I’ll share it now to see what other people think. 

In order to shift from combustion engine cars to electric is a massive shift. The R&D would be very expensive, and in general, I just think they are quite different products. Just because a company is good at making one, doesn’t mean they can effectively make the other. 

Ford also doesn’t have a great credit rating, so any money needed to pump into their EV’s will be quite costly, meanwhile other EV companies in general have much better access to cheap capital. 

What do people think? Ford has been dying for years, it seems like quite the speculative bet that they will have quite the turnaround.

Getting all those things right requires investment and R&D that they assume from their marketing research no one is interested in (despite everyone saying they are interested in it).  The truth is everyone does want it, but what you would end up getting because of those regulations wouldn't end being something you would buy.

And lets say the EV thing pays off. What then? Just because you make an EV doesn't mean you will magically sell a lot more cars than before. There are only so many new car buyers each year.

The F-150 looks fantastic and starts at $58K. Similar to the Cybertruck pricing and compared to the hummer $110K it seems like a steal. 

They are bringing a higher performing electric vehicle that a lot more people can afford. I hope it continues and if successful they could be the leading manufacturer of electric vehicles in the US soon. 

I think a price point of $15 or so with a market cap of $58 billion seems reasonable to me over the next year or so. Maybe it does hit that $20 if actually the leader in the US in a couple years. Not crazy. 

What is crazy is Tesla market cap of $577 billion.  Other people will catch up. I’m personally looking at the Porsche Taycan or Audi e-tron GT instead of the S because of dealerships and performance reviews I have been reading."

2021-05-20 18:32:40,stocks,Microsoft sat at around $30 for some time until it blew up. Some stocks go into hibernation mode and blow up all of sudden. At least Ford has always had a nice dividend.
2021-05-20 15:00:27,stocks,"They're going to make little to nothing on the lower end models. Their battery costs are too high and sale prices too low. Luxury packages like Platinum, Lariat, and King Ranch are what's going to keep the F150e profitable.

They'll likely make those luxury models 1st and relegate all other orders until later.

Also, don't expect them to make a huge amount. MachE is capped at 50k units for all of 2021 because they don't have the battery supply for more."
2021-05-20 14:41:49,stocks,"This. Normally, when an industry is forced to spend capital due to an external trend or factors (in this case, societies moving away from gas powered cars), it's not the companies (or their profits) that benefit. 

The EV shift is somewhat different though since there will be winners and losers, some incumbents aren't going to make it. So you could argue that if GM and Ford survive the transition to EVs, their prospects will be good in that new competitive landscape. The other thing is that governments are going to subsidize EVs so in theory, Ford (as a relatively early mover) could benefit from this.

But yes, you are asking the right question."
2021-05-20 16:54:37,stocks,"When OEMs adopt 100% EVs, they will be able to cut costs.  There are a lot less moving parts on an EV, which reduce headcount in so many ways.  One, you don't need so many suppliers.  Two, you don't need so many factory workers.  Three, you don't need so many engineers.  Oh, those 20 engineers you have that design starting systems?  No more starter, no more ignition, no more alternators.... no more engineers.  Ford could cut 50% of its product development and manufacturing jobs just by switching to EV.  This is one reality that OEMs are keeping in their back pocket.  Do they legitimately want to help the environment?  Yes and no, but they are also purely motivated by profits and PR.  I am a former Ford BEV/xHEV product development engineer."
2021-05-20 15:21:41,stocks,"I feel the same way, if Ford is selling X number of cars per year now, switches over to EVs, and sells the same number of cars, why would that improve the share price? If anything they're just mitigating loss of market share, I suppose that could be a good sign to investors but I wouldn't expect explosive growth from a company who's business model is essentially ""we're trying our best to not become irrelevant"""
2021-05-20 15:09:19,stocks,Ford makes money off of utility esque vehicles.  Not cars.  It is smart for them to focus on trucks and truck-ey things.  But I feel like this market will be the most hesitant to adapt to EV's.

2021-05-20 14:44:42,stocks,"They're not trying to take over the truck market. You can tow 10k lbs in a Lightning but you'll need to stop to charge far short of 230 miles. There are plenty of use cases where a Lightning doesn't work for buyers, Ford's a long way from full electrification. 

But there's a ton of profit on the high end trims of the F150, with the Lightning they'll get that $700M EV investment paid off in a significantly shorter time than if they bet it all on the Mustang Mach E."
2021-05-20 15:09:08,stocks,"They dont have a choice. Gas engines are gonna go the way of the dinosaur eventually and if ford doesnt establish their EV truck market share early they'll be screwed. 

It opens the door to new customers as well. There are alot of people who wont buy gas powered vehicles anymore (and more who would only buy very fuel efficient vehicles) that now will have an F150 as an option."
2021-05-20 14:52:51,stocks,They either go EV or wait until someone else takes share when they launch their Truck EVs. Have to do it more or less. Or just fold up shop one day.
2021-05-20 16:34:14,stocks,"They’re not trying to sell this to people who buy trucks for working on the farm or because they like lifted big engine trucks. These, in my opinion, are targeted at two (big) demographics. Suburban dwellers who like and have wanted trucks (like a lot of people) but didn’t want to deal with the mpg for commuting daily, 1. And fleets of trucks for things like colleges (for example) which would buy the cheap one, not drive super far, and all return to a central charging point at night. That might cannibalize their sales to a point, but better to do that now, ahead of the competition. No point waiting for someone else to do it first"

2021-05-20 14:26:34,stocks,"the F150 is a great truck.  Using the same shell and trying to stuff batteries in it likely won't be great.  

Every single auto maker that has tried this did not succeed.  It's a different technology platform and therefore has different needs.  Stuffing the EV tech into a design meant for a gas engine rarely turns out well.

2021-05-20 14:27:13,stocks,Theyre known for hauling loads and reliability in all climate conditions. When you work in rural communities ... there are fords. Theyre also very entry level price point for pickups and best in class. Dodge Dakota is the shitbox of trucks and they don't get anywhere near comparable to the ranger series. Mazda ? Still a joke. Tesla? No farmer will hang up their balls and buy one. The ev market for trucks however.. when gas keeps rising.. that may be interesting.
2021-05-20 13:54:43,stocks,This comment is hilariously wrong.

It really boils down to statistics, its a 50/50 chance, either it grows, or it doesn't."
2021-05-20 16:24:01,stocks,"I think we should also take into account a head start in EV adoption when thinking about the auto industry. Some big players like Toyota haven't shown any seriousness in transitioning to that space so there is the room for growth you mentioned.

Also it is expensive to develop EVs right now but by the time they're mass producing them, battery costs will go down even more. Probably not as wildly as the last decade but still enough to make an impact. Their partnership with a established battery maker (SK Innovation) should also help with that. EVs also require less moving parts and less complex manufacturing so there should be better margins once battery costs start coming down.

All that being said, I have no clue if it'll reach $20 or not, I'd lean t the no side since they've siloed themselves to the pickup truck and SUV market. That is the most profitable market though."
2021-05-20 15:47:22,stocks,"The margin will be lower in the short term. On the long term, EV with their limited amount of moving pieces will likely be way easier to manufacture and will most likely improve margins on car manufacturing.

At this point, margins take a hit because battery are still in early development, but as they improve EV will be easier to mass produce on automated assembly lines"
2021-05-20 16:04:20,stocks,I am not buying ford but I think it has potential because the government is planning to move all their vehicles to EV and I feel the government and a lot of Americans will prefer FORD over Tesla.
2021-05-20 16:34:44,stocks,"but the hype inherently makes it a potential good investment. The market has demonstrated for years that it seems to ignore fundamentals - it likes ""ideas"". A popular electric truck is one of those ""ideas"" - and it's not like it's Tesla with an insane valuation (NOT getting into whether or not their valuation is justified, I don't think it is but Tesla lovers clearly do). F stock has a P/E of like 12. So to start pricing in future earnings isn't that outrageous."

2021-05-20 15:28:08,stocks,"Not to mention think of the mechanics of how combustion vehicles operate and how EVs will. There will no longer be a need for complex inventories of parts, tools, and training. EVs are far more simple and require less maintenance than their combustion counterparts. With this said, auto manufacturers will likely lose or need to restructure their parts and sales income."
2021-05-20 16:13:43,stocks,"When there is a market disruption like how EVs are disrupting gas vehicles, most, if not all incumbents suffer. It’s hard to determine the winners ahead of time.

Banter aside, ICE is being phased out, so it's a high stakes innovation race."
2021-05-20 16:30:17,stocks,"You're looking at it the wrong way on this play.

You can't compare it to the high-growth companies that are trying to achieve mass consumption of a new product over old products.

Ford is still very large and produces many cars and has a wide foot print with lots of experience new competitors don't have.

With technological shift, they will be forced to re-tool. They will need to downsize some operations, upsize others, and create all new ones. Luckily, 3rd part companies are making critical component, like the batteries themselves, so they don't have to build that up front and prices are continuing to fall on batteries.

This isn't to say this is a great buy for massive growth. Rather, it is a stock traders are predicting will slowly go down hill and the market capitalization is very small relative to the size of their operation, rather it is a play at Value. You're making a bet they will have more success at maintaining some market share long-term and be able to re-tool their operations and cut old costs from combustion engine cars more easily than expected.

Said another way, imagine buying one of Tesla's main future competitors for a tiny fraction of TSLA's current market capitalization. TSLA's capitalization is 11x that of F, yet F makes nearly 12x as much revenue currently. F does have declining profitability problems, because of these market changes.

They currently have a P/E ratio of only 12.6. 

The market isn't putting much money or excitement into this, but if there are unknown future hiccups going electric to the masses that cause delays it can be short-term gain for combustion automakers. If Ford can change their operations easier than expected to all EV and remain a competitor there is value not being priced into the stock. These are both scenarios that could lead to short-term success or long-term success for Ford.

I'd also note that the long timeline of transition between combustion cars and electric cars will likely be long enough, that many of the earlier technology patents already established will run out. This will make it easier to competitors to copy each other, which can be both good and bad for various competitors.

I don't directly own Ford. I'm not jumping into this and I haven't really researched it. I'm not arguing they will be successful. 

Rather, I just know it needs to be looked at from a different angle than from the high-growth excitement angle of a new company. It is a Value angle. Cheap price, huge revenue, large brand and foot print.

It is a question if an under-valued company with a far larger operation that will beat expectations on transitioning and potentially scaling down their operations appropriately to achieve profitability in the EV world. There is tremendous value here, if they can adjust and stay a EV competitor in the long-run.

They also have significant brand image and consumer bases that follow them. The F-150 Lightning they are working on is a big product line for them in the long-run. That brand image and customer base is large, if they can make it work and profitable to sell."

Maybe they are long shots, but they may change the world, and could create a larger market than currently exists. Like ubers and lyfts customer base is larger than the taxi markets that existed before they were around. I want to own an electric car and if I don't invest in the development why should anyone else. 



With that said there are a lot of EV companies out there I wouldn't invest in, I still want to make money and invest in legitimate projects. I did invest in F when they announced they were making an electric car."
2021-05-20 19:38:19,stocks, EV is significant here because it's Ford. While never a huge percentage of my portfolio I held it for the divs and on the small chance they would move into the new century. The reason the stock declined for a long time/stagnated is that the company never showed a lot of innovation or initiative to broaden their scope or really move to address evolving challenges in manufacturing etc. This ultimately affects their earnings and standing against GM and others which isnwhy its never done fantastic. I feel this is more a show that management is willing to take the bull by the horns and try to break out of their shell a bit
2021-05-20 17:28:11,stocks,"You don't seem to think EVs are here to stay.  It definitely sounds like you think it could be a fad. I think that is incredibly naive. People are buying stock based on which carmakers they think will transition to EV most successfully. Don't get me wrong, GM saying ""we'll be all electric by 2035"" seems like a reason to avoid their stock since 1) Tesla is already ""all electric"" 2) People want affordable EVs right now, not  15 years of hybrids lol"
2021-05-20 18:17:55,stocks,"What are you talking about?

The legacy auto manufacturers have the expertise, marketing, name recognition/following, and engineering to absolutely bury Tesla as they transition to the EV market.  Contrary to some of the less technical savvy out there, EVs are MUCH simpler than an ICE drivetrain.   

Tesla is *not* going to be made irrelevant, but they were never at any point in time going to have a monopoly on EV sales.  Unfortunately, their market cap still reflects that.

Edit: Added “*not*” irrelevant.  Previous omission was a typo.  I do not think Tesla will become irrelevant."

This is especially true once self driving cars eventually hit the market (be it years or decades later). Tesla is already pioneering this, you can buy speed upgrades for your car via software updates in addition to FSD.

But Ford and a lot of other automakers aren't very good at making software. An increasing number of them, including Ford, are turning their OS over to Google's Android, which makes selling software upgrades a lot harder in the future."

I think ford is actually a reasonably solid company, but the stocks just don't perform well. It might make a few % gain in the short term.

Also as part of a larger transition to electric cars in the US, being the first company to offer a consumer grade truck that isn't crazy expensive will attract some customers, it's just a bit of a niche market- those that want a pickup but are okay with short range and a relatively new technology."

Tesla is also production constrained as a whole across their entire lineup. Production issues happen all the time, especially within these past few months, but they are short term problems.

Medium term, the Biden administration has made domestic chip production a priority with $50B of funding for research and production in an upcoming infrastructure bill which should on the floor this summer. Biden clearly also has Ford in mind, seeing as how he just toured their factory and unveiled the F150 lightning. 

Long term Ford stands to be one of the biggest EV manufacturers in the world. The F150 currently rivals the Toyota Corolla in terms of sales numbers. And the F150 and Transit van are some of the best selling vehicles in their respective segment, of which there is a lot of demand and of which they are also beating Tesla to market with the Lightning and electric transit, unlike almost all of the other car brands with their sedan competitors."

Tesla operates in a high margin luxury vehicle space, with no serious competition because building EVs is not profitable yet and OEMs like making money.

Anyway, by “outperform”, I mean that from today until 5 years from now, Tesla stock will grow more from where it’s at now percentage-wise than Ford will grow from where it’s at now percentage wise.

If Volkswagen and Herbert Diess can implement their plans of becoming a fully top-down tech-first auto company with everything in-house (and being in the industry I have some idea of how serious VW is at not being dependent on literally anyone especially for their software and services, as they see that as the key differentiator in an electric era), the revaluation of the stock price alone should make up a large portion the growth I'm looking for.

A bunch of the VW evs were the same way but they started to get the picture and went out and developed a custom EV frame so I'm holding out hope with them.

Fords strategy is not new in the EV world.  They just happen to be doing it with a pickup truck.  They've probably learned a few lessons from the others which may make their product marginally better but the premise is still there.  

You are going to have a very tough time making an EV from the frame of an ICE vehicle.   Especially when you try to start adding the same computer electronics that Tesla has.  It just doesn't fit in the same frame.

2021-05-20 13:16:48,stocks,"I may not be completely understanding your question but my guess is that the value of the put has gone up, which is why you're showing a profit.

For example, you buy 2 puts of XYZ @ 165 strike for $4 while it's trading at $167. The stock drops to $164 before any time decay really catches up, in this case you should be able to sell your puts at a profit.

The breakeven for options is indeed strike plus/minus premium but that includes time decay. If you let these puts expire in the money then you will sell the shares at $161.

2021-05-20 14:47:53,stocks,"No, a REIT is more akin to a stock.  It stands for Real Estate Investment Trust.  Basically a REIT is a company that owns and operates real estate with the goal of earning an income.  Due to the tax structure of REITs it is cheaper for them to pay out most of the profits as dividends so typically people invest in them for income and some growth.  Real estate is obviously a huge area so there are REITs for things from residential apartments to industrial yards."

2021-05-20 13:56:37,stocks,"This is a misconception. Practically all the defense contractor can do the same thing especially when it comes to IT services. The bigger ones might manufacture things and thus have some unique legacy thing going on (planes, vehicles, weapons, etc) but almost anyone can step in to do IT stuff and develop analytics/data systems and such. The key thus is landing contracts. Just because they work together doesnt mean anything.

This is the same problem I have with Palantir. People dont seem to understand how IT contracting works and that most of these companies are less ""tech"" than engineering services which doesnt scale nearly as well due to the niche/labor factor. But contracting is less risky than startup tech so it just depends on your personal apetities.

But back to the point. Whats the point to owning LDOS when you can chose the other contractors? Is there something happening with them that might set them up for faster growth than their competition?"
2021-05-20 15:21:56,stocks,Let us know what you find
2021-05-20 14:42:34,stocks,"NASA had three companies to choose a Human Landing System (HLS) for the return to the moon from: Dynetics (a subsidiary of Leidos), Blue Origin and SpaceX. The contract was given to SpaceX for 2.9 billion dollars. Dynetics did not get the contract because: Their asking price was 'significantly higher' than Blue Origin's which was in turn significantly higher than SpaceX's. Also, aside from the way over-budget asking price, there were some serious technical issues. Apparently, their design had 'negative mass' aka, it was too heavy for its engines to slow down enough to land on the moon. It is possible Congress will give more money to NASA so they can award a second company along with SpaceX, but this will mostly likely be Blue Origin as they are cheaper than Dynetics and have no inherent technical faults.

I don't know how much of Leidos Dynetics makes up, but in my opinion, after the report NASA gave on them, they are done."
2021-05-20 14:28:41,stocks,"Leidos owns Dynetics, and Dynetics lost a big NASA contract dubbed HLS (human landing system). Actually I don't think they ""lost it"" per se - they got a lot from NASA as part of the development of a HLS design, but didn't get selected to actually produce it. SpaceX got that final contract, but there's actually a lawsuit over this that may end up impacting it somehow."

I hear what you are saying, but it appears Leidos does some stuff that is a bit different. LMT is a great company, but LDOS seems to be as well and they are much smaller of a company. I would imagine they have more room to grow than someone like LMT. But I could be wrong, that's why I made this post. I am playing devil's advocate a bit just to gain more insight, not to be a dick."

2021-05-20 00:00:00,stocks,"3D Systems Corp. (DDD) stock rises during pre-market trading session. Here’s to know why? 3D Systems Corp. (NASDAQ: DDD) stock surged by 1.7% at the last close while the 3D Systems stock price gains further by 1.06% in the pre-market trading session. 3D Systems, based in Rock Hill, South Carolina, designs, produces, and sells 3D printers, 3D printing products, and 3D scanners, as well as providing a 3D printing facility. Chuck Hull, 3D System’s former president, and CTO invented stereolithography and received a patent for it in 1986.

Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminded plaintiffs on May 17, 2021, that the closing date to file a lead plaintiff petition in the class action brought on behalf of investors who bought or otherwise acquired 3D Systems Corporation shares between May 6, 2020, and March 1, 2021, inclusive (the “Class Period”) was approaching on June 8, 2021

Defendants made knowingly inaccurate and/or misleading claims during the Class Period, according to the lawsuit, and refused to reveal significant adverse information regarding 3D Systems’ industry, activities, and prospects. Defendants specifically refused to inform investors that:

3D Systems violated adequate internal controls on financial reporting.
As a result, Defendants’ claims about 3D Systems, activities, and prospects were materially inaccurate and deceptive and/or lacked a fair basis at all applicable times.

3D Systems filed an NT-10K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2021, reporting that its 10-K filing will be postponed for the reasons stated in their March 1, 2021 press release. On this news, 3D Systems’ stock dropped $7.62 per share, or 19.6%, to close at $31.17 per share on March 2, 2021, causing investors to lose money."

2021-05-20 00:00:00,stocks,"SQM and lithium demand I have been out of lithium miners since the beginning of this year after I exited my Livent position at what I thought was a peak at ~$20 per share. As I see them rally again I decided to look into more value oriented plays. Although I am a big fan of mining companies currently, I though that lithium miners we're about priced in when it came to forward demand. 

That being said, I have always still kept an eye on stocks such as albemarle and SQM. SQM seems to be at a very good value standpoint right now after they got beat up due to the chilean government transition. I believe at this point the stock is oversold and now is a good time to take a position. The company trades at a relatively high p/e right now, but I believe higher lithium prices and higher quality lithium demand will be a factor in their growth moving forward to 2022 and 2023. 

SQM's long term debt stands at just under $2b, which I do not think is terrible given how much of it was acquired during covid. They are also not a lithium pure play, and have a sizable portion of the market for iodine, which is used in the medical field as well as potassium nitrates for fertilizers. Their main income is definitely from lithium and this will continue to be true.

They have a joint venture in Australia that is supposedly coming online in the middle of this year that is focused on production of lithium hydroxide. This is a risk it seems as SQM has not produced lithium from a hard rock project it seems and this holds execution risk, although I am not worried much about it, it is worth noting. Another risk would be the chilean government altering land agreements and taxes, which is also probably not too much of a worry as lithium is taxed heavily as is. The land agreements even less so because most changes to land would be for private entities, and SQM leases their land from the government. 

All in all, the risk reward on this stock after the sell off seems relatively solid and I have initiated a position and plan to hold/dca down if the opportunity presents. Lithium prices are still quite low and the company doing better will depend on the lithium prices creeping up for the next few years as demand is supposed to increase substantially. 

Albemarle is also a great company, I haven't read up on them too much, but I believe at a quick glance, you could get away with starting a position now and averaging down if the chance presents itself. These are my the 2 companies that I would recommend to actually go long on for lithium mining. The LIT ETF is also good, but I prefer individual stock picking."

I like mining plays right now and with the setbacks a lot of the lithium players have seen, it's probably a decent time to reevaluate them."

As others have said - there is nothing that’s 100% safe in investing. The S&P LONG TERM should be the safest of them all. But year to year the S&P isn’t immune to losing value (and at times a lot of value). They’ve had years where it’s declined by 14.6, 26.4, 8, 11, 22, and 37%.

There was a 10 year window from 2001-2011 where it returned 3%, and if we're to assume a 10% average, then we are prime for a slower decade to balance the huge decade we just had. 

The point here is, investing involves risk, and while the market is generally always going up, there are no guarantees and 10% is a high mark."

I think the majority of people who are “DCA’ing” aren’t pacing their investing in terms of holding money out of the market for weekly purchases or what have you - but rather they’re limited in their ability to invest until they get paid bi-weekly, monthly, whatever it might be.

2021-05-20 00:00:00,stocks,"What is the benefit of a company issuing a one-time special cash dividend? I own a decent amount of shares of FutureFuel Corp ($FF). The company released quarterly earnings reports a few weeks ago and revenue was down quite a bit. This led to the stock dropping about 15%. A day later the company announced they would be paying out a one-time special cash dividend of $2.50 per share. Obviously this is a pretty crazy high amount of money to pay out per share. In response to that announcement, share price rose about 30%.

What confuses me is what benefit a company would gain from doing this? I am not complaining about the payout, but it seems like the timing of the announcement was to offset the poor quarterly earnings report. Why would a company who saw a ~20% drop in revenue choose to make a payment out to shareholders like this?"

2021-05-20 11:09:22,stocks,the benefit is to the shareholders rising 30% + the special div not to the company itself
2021-05-20 11:19:14,stocks,"There is no real benefit. There’s a few reasons why the company might do this. 

If management compensation is based on company share price, they can influence it by sending out a one time special dividend which might lead investors to think it’s a positive signal by mgmt, etc. 

If the company has excess cash, and has no other uses for it, then a special dividend also isn’t necessarily good or bad. Personally, I would rather companies focus more on looking for acquisitions, or re-investing into R&D or CapEx to drive growth. I also do know that it’s not realistic to always find these opportunities hence, it’s neither a good or a bad thing. 

I don’t know much about the company you mentioned, but check the financial statements of the company and see if it makes sense for them to be issuing this one time dividend. If it doesn’t, it is definitely a red flag on management. Capital allocation is extremely important for a company to be successful in the long term."
2021-05-20 09:24:36,stocks,You’ve already got the answer. Some companies pay out high dividends beyond what they earn for a while. Basically tricking investors by the yield.
2021-05-20 12:21:54,stocks,"The times that I've seen this happen were followed by a potential buyout/merger. They do this to lower the outstanding share price to make the company more attractive for the buyout.

2021-05-20 10:48:12,stocks,"When faced with a situation that is confusing such as this decision by management I would look into what the management and top shareholders have to gain by this. 

Without having all the info I can’t say if this is a good or bad decision but sometimes management teams make major mistakes that put companies on the ropes or brink of bankruptcy and sometimes they have a strong long term plan that makes sense when you zoom out. See their reasoning for it and if it’s not up to your standard then dip after the ex-dividend date or whenever you best feel like."

Seems like you answered your own question there. I think that keeping the shareholders happy with something to look forward to in order to avoid a big sell-off after the poor earnings report is exactly the reason why they are doing it."

2021-05-20 00:00:00,stocks,"Who are the bagholders if *everyone* sets a say 5% stoploss and there's a correction of say 30%? When there's a massive bubble burst and everyone have set a certain stoploss, what happens when **everyone's stoplosses are triggered at the same time**?

Prime broker clients will get their stoplosses executed first. But for the rest of us, how do brokers prioritize stoploss executions? 

Is a stoploss just an automated sell order and not a guarantee that your order will be executed?

Will IRL most of these stoploss not get executed due to brokers facing 'excess network loads' or 'regulatory constraints'?"
2021-05-20 08:26:48,stocks,Someone has to buy for someone to sell...
2021-05-20 08:49:05,stocks,"OP there are several kinds of stop losses. The one that's relevant here would be a stop loss, and a stop limit. I'll use your example and set the values at -5% for both.

AAPL is worth $100. It drops down to $70 all of a sudden.

Stop loss: It triggers a market sell order when the stock drops below $95. Since it dropped so quickly and everyone's market order for a sell order is trying to activate.. your order might actually sell at the bottom of the dip. You've now sold the shares for $70 each. Or possibly, anywhere from $70 to $95.

Stop limit: It triggers a sell order for EXACTLY $95. Since the stock dropped to $70 so quickly, no one is interested in your sell order of $95 as everyone else is selling it for $70 - $71. Congrats you are now a bagholder as you still have the stock."
2021-05-20 11:25:04,stocks,"Everyone else who couldn’t execute at 5% stop loss. 
Your scenario will play out like this:

Price down to 95-Down 5% SELL!
* bag1 sells at 95
* bag2 place order at 95 - executing broker can’t find any buyer at 95 so takes the next best price 94
* Bag3 - sells but execute at 93
* then liquidity dries up
* Bag 200: panic sells and executes at 50

Now market closes at the last trade of 50. So market is down at 50%

Look up “flash crash”. That’s actually what happens when everyone had a stop loss at a certain threshold."
2021-05-20 08:45:19,stocks,"So a stop loss is basically your broker entering a market sell order on your behalf once a threshold is hit.  Who goes first is going to be whose broker has the best software and the fastest connection to the market.  If there are no buyers the market will instantly drop the 30% and everyone will get that price or probably lower in your scenario where everyone is selling at the exact same time.  A stop limit is the same concept but you set a limit on the sell in which case your sell order will not trigger and I guess you are bag holder as you are still holding the stock.  However in your scenario unless there was some huge accounting scandal like Enron, odds are the market orders will probably get a worse price as the stock will probably bounce back off the lows.  Essentially your scenario would cause a flash crash where the computers all started selling at the same time and eventually the buyers will see value and bring it back up (not all the way but above the lows all the market orders sold at)"

Who’s buying the shares after a 30% drop? The whales who likely had to do with the stock dumping in the first place"
2021-05-20 09:07:04,stocks,"First of all, it's almost impossible for everyone to have a stop loss at the same price.

Secondly, brokers prioritise stop orders based on first in-first out. So, if there are 10 stop orders at the same price, the trader who placed it first will exit first. 

There are two types of stop orders- **Stop limit** and **stop market**. In the first, you set a stop loss and a limit order. So, if prices trade between the two, your order gets executed. In the second, once the stop order is triggered, your order is closed at the next possible price. There are chances that your stop limit does not execute, but stop market orders are always executed.

If you're not day trading then don't use stop loss orders, you really don't need them and it's likely you'll lose more money than if you just held through the volatility."
2021-05-20 13:42:33,stocks,"But why would I need to set a stop loss in the first place, unless I'm actively trading?

If I'm holding a whole bunch of stocks, say 30+, I see two scenarios.. Either one company of them crashing, and here a stop loss would save me some money, but mostly I'll survive on my remaining positions. Or an entire spectrum of the market falling, with a whole bunch of them falling, and here I'd rather maintain because what the hell, these always come back up, eventually, and a stop loss would sell all my stuff for a loss, and I'm most likely to buy them again after they've risen above my sell price..

2021-05-20 09:41:06,stocks,"A stop loss is just a market sell, or a limit if you do a stop limit, that gets place if the stock trades at less than a certain amount. If the price instantly drops well below the trigger, then you are going to market sell into whatever liquidity is left. If the only bids left are at 0.01, you're selling for 1 cent. If you had a limit, and the price instantly drops below your limit, your order will be placed but won't execute until it goes back up to your limit. Usually big gaps only happen over times trading is closed / halted, but can happen any time since price is just the last trade, its the existing bids that determine what you can get for your shares."

Here is a hypothetical, that will ***never*** happen: if suddenly all buy orders disappear then the price drops, and keeps falling, and keeps falling, and no one is buying and everyone's SL is triggered (i.e. active at the next possible buy) but still there are no buys, and it is falling 10%, first Stop of trading. Reopen and it gaps lower, 15% drops to 20% lower and the second break of the day gets called. And actually. This would be the end of the day. Finito. Everyone go home, or better still, to the pub. Have a beerio, you clearly need it. Although no one lost a penny today (in real money) on paper they got obliterated. The next day at open, it gaps lower yet again, 25% and then finally after more decline, a order is filled at -30% and every buy gets hit with a sell order resulting from a stop loss.


Now at this point, because as you put it *everyone* has a stop loss at -5% every single position would get triggered and the market crashes again, resulting in another day of early beer o clock just 5 minutes into the session and 20% down.

And at this point the NYSE might forcefully reset the stop loss orders. Or shut down trading for a day until it's sorted out.

Another comment in this thread mentions that when using stop loss priority is assigned on a first in first out basis, although I couldn't confirm it. 

Also TIL stop losses are dangerous (despite being sold as a safety mechanism) in panic selloffs or flash crashes, as they will sell your security at or near the lowest point"
2021-05-20 11:32:14,stocks,"This is the correct answer and in fact the rise in stop losses is pretty evident in the markets the past 10+ years with flash crashes. The stop triggered and transaction happens at the bid (which is gobbled up quickly and sent much lower as no one wants to catch the falling knife). 

Stop limits are much less common and the reality is if you are setting something like that, you aren’t doing it as a protection but more of setting a boundary for your trade idea.

I’d also point out that setting stop losses is a data point that your broker has. It is a real thing to see the underlying go “hunting” for stops."
2021-05-20 13:02:28,stocks,"> Stop limit: It triggers a sell order for EXACTLY $95

To clarify, there should be two variables with a stop limit order. One the stop trigger and two the limit price. If they're both set to $95 it would happen like you said but your limit could also be either higher or lower than the stop trigger price."

2021-05-20 09:00:18,stocks,"Stop losses are bad news if your goal is holding long-term. At least a couple of times a year there's a flash crash that screws the people with stop losses because the price drops quickly in a matter of seconds and then immediately recovers. So you locked in a sale for 10-20% lower than the current price. Congrats!

If you want to protect yourself from a flash crash, a stop limit order would work, but otherwise just don't bother if you are planning to hold long-term. These types of orders are more useful to day traders who want to protect themselves if a trade goes the wrong way."
2021-05-20 13:25:00,stocks,"Stop loss doesn't exactly work like how you describe.

If the security price drops below your stop loss, say $95, you will sell your position at ANY price. Most of the time, it is around $95.

But in a flash crash situation, if there is no buyer and you are unlucky, theoretically nothing is stopping your stop loss to be executed at 90,80, or even $20."

If you put in a stop-market on a stock, you'll get triggered at the market once the stock hits the stop - there should never be an instance where the price blows through your stop and it never gets triggered (if this happens, call your broker because it means they fucked up). There is always a market. The market makers add liquidity to the market for this reason. 

However, the exact price that you get triggered will be at the prevailing market. That market may tank by the time your order goes live, it does happen. So you are not guaranteed to be sold out at exactly your stop price but the order will execute."
2021-05-20 11:11:27,stocks,"I think the term Stop and Loss may help- you set the trigger price- the Stop point which activates the order at the Loss price. So compare lets say a stop point is 10$ and a Loss point at 8$-  to one with a stop point at 10$ and a loss at 9$- 

The 8$ one will be much more likely to fill during a huge dump while the closer your stop and loss point is less likely to fill. 

So if you are trying to protect something really volatile or vs huge unexpected down swings- it is good to feed the market makers more of the difference to increasing your odds of losing the bag."

If there aren't enough buyers immediately to fill all the market orders created, the market makers would drop the ask price until buyers pick up all the orders. Then the price would go back up.

But there's a 0% chance every single holder of a given security will set the same stop-loss so this would never happen."

Stop limits are safer, but provide no protection from prolonged crashes, only flash crashes.

Also, keep in mind crashes can occur after hours, in which case most brokers don't provide any kind of stop. I have seen people massively burned because their stops didn't trigger after hours. I can't name it here, but one stock fell from like $60 to $30 overnight, and then continued to fall to under $20. People woke up one morning and were really pissed their stops didn't trigger.

So, ultimately, there really isn't any reliable form of protection."

That's actually a very viable possibility.  
Suppose your stop loss triggers if it the stock hits a 5% loss.  
If the gap is instead of a 6% loss, there's a possibility your stop loss order will never trigger, because you agreed to sell at a 5% loss, not a 6% loss.

In order to prevent gaps, the order would have to be: ""if the stock loses more than X%, sell to market"".

2021-05-20 13:05:44,stocks,"If that's true, there shouldn't be any issue for my broker to resubmit without me doing anything."
2021-05-20 11:39:02,stocks,Youre getting downvoted because stop loss hunting is illegal but the fines are much smaller generally than the profit.
2021-05-20 14:47:42,stocks,Which brokers are reputable?
2021-05-20 17:50:14,stocks,"Be aware on some exchanges, eg London, selling order book data and pay for order flow are illegal and some regulators are much more switched on than others."
2021-05-20 11:49:03,stocks,"I thought payment for order flow was scummy. 
Stop runs, delayed execution, restricting accounts.. Discount brokers will always try to make a quick buck."
2021-05-20 15:03:01,stocks,"You mean to tell me those honest Wallstreet men and woman intentionally do shit like this????!?!?

/sarcasm

I’ve noticed that needs to be put on more and more posts these days"
2021-05-20 14:43:22,stocks,"Just wondering, what stop reputable brokers to do the same. Would there be bigger legal repercussion for them?"
2021-05-20 13:32:52,stocks,"If you make it back in before it recovers, the idea of a flash crash is it’s really quick. You’ll probably get back and see you sold your shares at 90 in your example, and they’re trading at 100 with no idea why. Long term holders don’t tend to be watching constantly."
2021-05-20 13:00:28,stocks,"The hypothetical scenario was one in which the price recovered.  Unless you have a bracket order to also buy at that low price, you’ve sold for less than the current price."
2021-05-20 17:40:23,stocks,"NO !
Your stoploss is triggered at $90 and can be executed at ANY price your broker can get at the time in the circumstances everyone finds themselves in.  You WILL see days that you cannot sell anything for a price you want, you simply sell at a price someone is willing to pay, like $65"
2021-05-20 12:33:12,stocks,"I mean, I'd you already know where the prices are going to go then that's a great strategy"
2021-05-20 17:18:17,stocks,Literally ZERO assurance you can or will get out at $90.
2021-05-20 16:44:49,stocks,"Except those kinds of crashes to $70 are rare, compared to the smaller dips that stop you out at the $90.

The issue isn't being able to buy back in.  It's getting stopped out on normal market movements designed to exploit your fear to take your money."
2021-05-20 10:17:07,stocks,MMs aren't required to buy stock at X because you want to sell it at X. They're required to have a quote for the stock. Go put a limit sell 10% above market and tell me which MM fills it for you.
2021-05-20 11:14:46,stocks,stop **market** would indicate that it's not a price of your choosing.
2021-05-20 10:04:03,stocks,That's true and I never said anything to the contrary.
2021-05-20 14:13:53,stocks,"That's not a viable possibility with a stop-market order, which is what I wrote in the piece you quoted.

For example, if you put in a stop-market order at $100 then it will send out a market order as soon as the stock trades at or below $100. It doesn't matter how far below $100 and it doesn't matter what the next best bid is. 

The only time it will not trigger is if it's a stop-limit order. If you put in a stop at $100 and the limit at $99 as well. If the stock trades at or below $100, it will send out a limit order at $99 that may or may not be executed.

Stop orders don't get sent to an exchange. They get held by brokers. Only the second leg gets sent to an exchange if the stop price is hit."
2021-05-20 13:07:28,stocks,[deleted]
2021-05-20 13:02:21,stocks,"They are different as one is a market and the other a limit order. Although I’m not sure if they specifically clear stop loss orders or when the market order clear/stoppage happens it clears them as well since they would be considered market orders. 

In either case the limit orders are left as they don’t contribute to what the breakers want to stop which is a free fall of the stock/index or an insane speculative jump either in some cases."
2021-05-20 13:16:48,stocks,"The problem is the order triggers as the stop loss is reached but does not fill and before it can  MM clear all market orders and in turn clear your order completely. The typical brokerage account without an advisor/manager doesn’t have a way of resubmitting the order automatically. 

So your order triggers-doesn’t get filled-gets erased-brokerage thinks it’s done it’s job completely so no resubmit."
2021-05-20 14:15:56,stocks,"Yeah I love the ""they can't do that, that's illegal"" argument

No, they break the rules ALL THE TIME and pay ""fees"" which are more like taxes because they still end up with PROFIT."
2021-05-20 14:29:38,stocks,"He’s getting downvoted because “short ladder attacks” don’t exist. Stop hunting, sure (and that’s not even illegal) but not the myth of the GME “short ladder attack.”"
2021-05-20 12:47:07,stocks,"Is it? I honestly have no clue, I’m asking. I couldn’t find anything concrete with a brief search.

100% would assume using secret information to gain an advantage would be illegal — and I’m guessing the fines would indeed not be a major deterrent for someone who was able to successfully execute on it."
2021-05-20 11:51:25,stocks,"I thought stop hunting was legal? 

Selling order data is illegal and reputable brokers guard that data like a dog (I hope).

But shady brokers, who knows what they do to earn money."
2021-05-20 17:36:56,stocks,"How do you expect ""free"" brokers to make money ?"
2021-05-20 11:53:26,stocks,"Yeah, in general I think it's best to just stay with a good broker.

If I am not paying them, then I presume someone else is.

I trade with Degiro, which is a pretty cheap broker here. I do know that they lend out shares (they are open about that), but I'm pretty confident they don't sell order flow."
2021-05-20 16:33:46,stocks,Fair enough :)
2021-05-20 16:32:38,stocks,"If you've set a stop-loss and an alarm for the triggering of this action, I would think you should be looking for a good point to get back in. Perhaps I assumed too much. I guess I'm trying to say that a stop-loss isn't bad because it somehow just stops the entire investment path you have in a stock. If you set a stop loss and it triggers, additional diligence on this stop-loss could save you money and even net you profit."
2021-05-20 10:21:32,stocks,"The question asked if the stop loss order is a guarantee that the market maker will take the security from you. It has nothing to do with limits. If you enter in a stop order and the stop price gets hit, you will get executed at the market usually against a market maker.

Stop-limits do not guarantee execution. But stop-markets do. You may not love the execution price but it will be executed."
2021-05-20 11:20:52,stocks,"I agree. Just think that some people interpret the order as ""sell at this price"" rather than ""sell at *any  market price below* this price"". I know I did once not understand that prices can ""jump"", although in retrospect that seems quite dumb."
2021-05-20 15:02:44,stocks,">For example, if you put in a stop-market order at $100 then it will send out a market order as soon as the stock trades at or below $100. It doesn't matter how far below $100 and it doesn't matter what the next best bid is.

But what if there are no buyers at that price? What if the buyers say, ""I will only buy if the stock is at a 20% discount""?"
2021-05-20 13:27:10,stocks,"What? Nothing that you said contradicts my statement. Just like any limit order, there is no guarantee that it will be executed but it is impossible for a limit order to be filled at a lower price for a sell or higher for a buy. That's what a limit order is."
2021-05-20 15:08:06,stocks,If it was a stop limit it wouldn’t have executed at all. Since you set a stop market it executed $9 below the price you wanted.
2021-05-20 15:51:36,stocks,Bro a stop limit won’t execute $9 below what you want.
2021-05-20 13:06:27,stocks,"I don't mean market and limit orders (which are of course different). I meant does a market order that is sent as a market order, and a stop loss than converts to a market order look any different to the exchange?

As I understand the answer is no so if the exchange clears all market orders it would also clear market orders from stop losses."
2021-05-20 13:30:34,stocks,"Hmmm. I don't have the background knowledge to refute what you're claiming but it feels wrong. My broker knows that my order wasn't executed. I guess that it would still show up in my ""completed"" orders list as cancelled or something. Not sure. Never experienced it so I'll just talk your word on it."
2021-05-20 14:40:17,stocks,"I get in the argument fairly regularly...

*""XYZ is **illegal**""*

Yes, it is.  But people can and do break the law regularly.

This applies to everything... Investing, driving, renting/evicting, etc

Laws don't protect you from harm.  Sure, they act as a deterrent sometimes but the more a reward outweighs the penalty, and the more enforcement seems improbable or toothless, the more people will ignore the law."
2021-05-20 15:06:45,stocks,"Short ladder attacks are also called wash sales/trades and they do exist. Numerous industry insiders have spoken about them.

But you can keep your head in the sand if that makes you feel better

Heh, EMUs downvoting 😂"

2021-05-20 12:44:27,stocks,That’s literally what payment for Order flow is and it’s legal. Also I think all brokers are getting into the business of selling trading data because it’s very profitable.
2021-05-20 17:52:13,stocks,Freetrade in the UK makes money via subscription for a wider selection of stocks and extra features because swelling order information isn't legal in the UK
2021-05-20 17:15:51,stocks,You’re not wrong. You’re just assuming there’s sufficient time gap in there between it crashing down and coming back up to make such a decision. That’s not always the case.
2021-05-20 11:22:09,stocks,"But that's the key point: when liquidity is drying up during a crash, the market makers will widen their bid-ask spreads massively to make sure they're protected. They'll make you pay dearly for liquidity if you need to offload your shares to them at that time."
2021-05-20 11:42:08,stocks,"It's best to think of the 'stop' part of the stop-market or stop-limit as just a trigger.

If the stock trades at or below the stop price, it will trigger the second leg of the order. If it's a market order, it'll be sold at the bid, regardless of where that bid is. If it's a limit order, it will send out a limit sell to the exchange."
2021-05-20 15:19:46,stocks,"Your stop price is irrelevant, it's only a trigger. It's not a real order. The real order is the market or limit order that get created once the trigger gets hit.

The order will go to the exchange as a market order as soon as the stock trades at or below your stop price. If the next best bid is 20% less then so be it. Granted, you are describing an extraordinarily rare circumstance because market makers provide the necessary liquidity to keep exactly that from happening. This kind of scenario is much more likely to play out on OTC stocks that trade 5000 shares a day.

A stop market order isn't much different than hitting the 'sell at market' button. The only difference is that you set it to go live only if it reaches a certain threshold. When you hit the sell at market button, how often do you get filled a price 20% lower than the last trade?"
2021-05-20 16:00:36,stocks,"yeah I'm a dumbass, checking my order history shows that one of my stops was market, with the rest of them being limit. I just chalked it up to the ridiculous scenario."

2021-05-20 13:11:03,stocks,"Yes, your correct they clear all market orders and in turn also clear the stop loss orders which would have been triggered and become market orders.

I miss understood your question on the orders as I skipped over the part where the view was from the MM and not the brokerage."
2021-05-20 13:34:44,stocks,I’m with you on the part where I don’t understand why they can’t resubmit I’m not sure on that at all and your broker would know better. I’m just sure on why they get canceled and not filled.
2021-05-20 14:45:52,stocks,"When I was in business school we had a simulation and our teacher programmed different legislation and the best way to win in the end was just to break most legislations and pay the fines, because our profits would be higher than the fines.

2021-05-20 13:48:31,stocks,"The alternative is paying for every move you make. Every buy, every sell, every limit order hit, that all becomes pretty expensive, I can imagine especially so for the type of people who debate over a couple hundredths of a percent in er fees."
2021-05-20 11:32:44,stocks,"That is right and it's a good argument why stop-markets aren't a good idea and it's exactly why I never use them.

Nonetheless, if you put in a stop-market order and the stop gets triggered there will not be any situation where you don't sell the stock at market."
2021-05-20 16:17:34,stocks,Yeah in general market orders are not recommended for volatile stocks or in generally on market open unless you really need to get in.

2021-05-20 19:02:02,stocks,"That’s sort of subjective though. I’d rather not pay for every trade, I don’t have the type of money to where that’s worthwhile. A lot of people don’t. 

As much as I may like a good conspiracy, I think it’s ridiculous to think that it’s solely to screw the retail customer. And any effect they could possibly have is further mitigated when you hold longer, just the same as trying to get your money’s worth on a commission trade. People decided they like it. As well as it means nothing when you buy and sell with limits as it’s a price you’re willing to accept. You’re not being screwed when you get what you ask for."
2021-05-20 00:00:00,stocks,"Put options vs shorting stock? If dealing with put options on stocks where the notional is either a big part of your account balance or even above it, is it financially better to short a stock you think is going down?

Like if I think stock XYZ trading at $100.00 is going to go down, is it more responsible to short sell five or ten shares than it is for me to buy a put option?

Actually, if I can afford 100 shares of stock XYZZ which trades at $20.00 and I think it is going down, is it actually more responsible to short 100 shares than it is to buy a put option?  The put option has an expiry date and theta decay.  But the short shares only move on price."

\- your losses are (theoretically) unlimited. \[See GME short squeeze for an example\]

\- you pay interest on your short 'loan' for as long as you have it

\- if the stock goes absolutely nowhere you break even, for the most part

&#x200B;

Buying puts:

\- your losses are limited to the amount that you wagered

\- your timeline is limited. when the time is up, that's it, you don't get any more time without paying more money

\- depending on the put that you buy, you could be right and still lose money

\- depending on the put that you buy, you could make exponentially more than if you simply shorted the stock"
2021-05-20 10:01:00,stocks,"Shorting has upside limited to the price of a share, while potential downside is unlimited. I don't get why anyone would want to short a stock."
2021-05-20 07:54:54,stocks,"Its risk versus reward. 

Puts are reasonable, because you can technically only lose your premium if the stock doesn't do what you want it to. Much safer, overall, but limited in its payoff or ROI even when your bet is right.

Shorts, can be much more lucrative, but typically work best when used en mass and the company dies. As, some SHFs have experienced recently- your losses, when your wrong, can technically be damn near infinite.

I climb my stairs at home on all fours, so please don't accept anything I say as financial advice."
2021-05-20 13:28:18,stocks,"One thing no one else has mentioned that I’ll point out is that you short sell in lots of 100 (like options). So you can’t just short sell 5 or 10 shares the minimum is 100.

As for my opinion: 

Due to borrow fees and interest rates on shares borrowed short selling is not for the majority of retail. It can pay off when you’re able to take large positions and have cash to burn if the trade turns a against you. You should be able to afford to buy calls you expect to expire worthless as insurance to short selling. 

If you’re trading with less than say 8 figures stick to puts if you’re bearish."
2021-05-20 08:27:48,stocks,"If you are going short I would stick to shorting an etf. Such as iwm, spy, etc. itm puts for stocks because a huge move on a short could make you owe more than your initial position.

2021-05-20 09:08:33,stocks,"> If u short a stock u have unlimited downside as the stock could keep going up and up

Theoretically, yeah. In practice when you lose all (in some brokers half) the money you put into the short position, you will be forced to buy back."
2021-05-20 07:56:55,stocks,"It depends though. With a put, you have to choose your time. When shorting, them shares are shorted until you reclaim them. One gives you infinite risk, but infinite time, the other gives you limited risk, but limited time."
2021-05-20 13:37:01,stocks,"Risk is far greater with options. If you think there will be a significant move down, you’re better off shorting the stock. The interest you pay daily is generally far less than the time decay you pay you lose on the option daily."
2021-05-20 08:29:40,stocks,This is actually backwards. Max gain for a short is 100p (company goes bankrupt). Puts and all options can go much higher than 100p if you time it right. Shorting just allows you to wait out your position and not worry about timing but your risk is higher.
2021-05-20 13:43:16,stocks,"This is incorrect. You can short sell any number of shares you want. I trade a completely hedged portfolio (long/short) with Fidelity, TD, and IB."

2021-05-20 08:11:50,stocks,"Do your DD before buying spce. Branson's sold off so many shares for double the price that hes paid for that company already, its house money. Chamath and wood both sold off huge positions recently. Everybody in the know has either sold half their position or quit their job in the last 3 months. 

If you do buy and see an article stating any of these people bought shares start looking for a sell point cause these guys will leave you holding bags faster than a tea cup."

2021-05-20 12:58:29,stocks,"There's no reason to go to space right now. No economic demand except for trips to the space station by Nasa, and SpaceX and Boeing already have those contracts. Anything you can think of (Mining minerals off asteroids, disposing waste, colonizing other worlds, moonwalks for tourism) is either unfeasible or impossible. 

So if you want to simply be apart of the quest to conquer space, then I can understand buying space stocks, but if you are trying to actually make money, expect to wait at least a hundred years"

2021-05-20 09:45:10,stocks,Okay I was already pretty confident they would fuck up this flight test one way or another (I've actually made a $10 bet that there will be some in-flight issue leading to mission failure) but now it's pretty much guaranteed.

I'm guessing they wanted to hold onto a really small position just as a way to track it and show their investors that ""they haven't given up entirely"" on a certain stock. Workhorse still has 365 shares as well.

Although chances are good at ~2 companies from my list probably don't exist anymore in 50 years. But since they all pay dividends you still get dividends from the years before they ceased to exist."

Mercedes is super popular among the young and old (atleast in Germany) and is quite exclusive, yet still delivers cars for the very rich (SLS AMG) but also for people that earn good money but are not super rich. 

They are moving into the right direction with Ola Källenius as CEO and I am sure Daimler can keep growing in the following years. Especially these sexy AMG and EQ cars (f.e. EQS) will be succesful."

Held onto or carelessly hopped into too many positions that I didn’t truly trust in which ended up setting me back a good amount. I just have to accept the market is irrational so it’s dangerous to buy anything I don’t have a firm grasp and am willing to tough through with. Particularly hurts to see a position surge back that I panicked over  and dropped cause I rushed into without understanding the macroeconomics.

Well not anymore. All I got at this point are my most trusted positions. Now if the market continues to keel over for 2-3 days straight when a Fed official so much as utters “inflation” or sneezes only to get short term memory loss and decide to pump it back double the next 2 days after, I won’t be pulling my hair has much trying to make sense of it all cause I’ll be perfectly content with the holdings I still have which I have full faith and understanding of.

If you are long congrats. However if you are gonna tell me about their amazing tech & innovation fuck off!  UPST is just another overvalued, Ai, SaaS, Payment High-flyer who forgot it’s 2021 but IPO’ed late last year under the shadow of ABNB & DASH however just like the ladder two GOLDMAN is also their Godfather (took all 3 public) and GS takes care of it’s babies.  Compared to it’s more celebrated peers UPST was of to a slow start. IPO’ed at $20 (the low end of the range $20 - $24), hardly drew any buzz and post IPO sat around for a few days kinda lost. 

GOLDMAN TO THE RESCUE: Once Goldman shoved a stupidly high valuation which the market accepted for ABNB & DASH then it focused it’s attention on poor little UPST and started to drive interest for the shares (part of the GS starter kit when you select them to run your IPO which founders & round investors love.  They need to make sure to pump the price hard before lock-up expiration *THIS IS KEY.

RECAP: UPST, went public at $20 in Dec the week after the other two and once public had a $1.8 Billion valuation and already trading at a rich valuation (just earlier in 2020 it has been valued around $800MM).  

TODAY’s VALUATIONS: Fast forward; today UPST is valued over $10 Billion trading at a whopping $135 per share Est PE: 200X PS: 40X PB: 30X (regardless of future potential growth these are disgustingly high valuations) oh JUST OVER 40% OF THE SHARES ARE STILL LOCKED!  

TRADE / LOCKUP EXPIRATION / JULY: Lock you for UPST is scheduled for early July which will increase the float by 40% and this event will trigger pressure on the shares (round investors selling, in creasing the supply) and mixed with a higher interest rate environment and stupid high valuations WILL CUT THE CURRENT PRICE BY AT LEAST 50%. (You know very well every single 2020 high flyer was cut in half this year. UPST is no exception just delayed). 

PROOF:  Goldman was the investment bank for several other similar IPO’s and applied the same formula.  Check to procure movements, IPO, ramp up, expiration lockup followed by substantial decrease of share prices.  SNOW, DASH, ABNB, BIGC, FROG, PLTR.  

BY AUG THE PRICE WILL BE $50-$60 AND I’LL BE UP 200% ON MY SHORTS"

They're idiots. they think short data published is faked and shorts still need to cover. which just isn't true. Short percentage on GME is 20.75%, not 100%+. But certain subs have become cult-like about GME and facts don't matter. 

GME trades like a momentum stock, somehow, remarkably, it has held up its stock price above 100. I believe it will eventually come back down to earth, but *even if* this is GME's true valuation, theres no longer reason to believe a short squeeze will move the price up further."

One thing I’ve been thinking about tho recently, is that one could probably try doing some quick (~1-2mo long) swing trades, as the past month or so has seen GME settle into a pattern of dropping to the 130-150 range and then popping up again to ~180, before tailing off for back down to the lower range. Maybe it’ll happen again, maybe it’ll drop back down to earth in the next cycle, or maybe I’m dead wrong about everything, but it is an interesting pattern. But the fact that it’s just casually lofting about in the mid 100’s for a couple months now is truly amusing lol"

Support is where if a stock is rising and starts to fall, where it will hang out around. Resistance is usually the level holding a stock down, so if a stock starts to rise, you can see it fall again because it's not breaking the resistance level. If you are a long term investor, usually these levels don't make much of a difference because you are looking at the fundementals of the company."

You can't experience such a huge shock and expect business as usual like nothing even happened.  Yet that's what the stock market looks like.

In his 2013 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Mr. Buffett described how he has advised trustees to manage the money he will leave to his wife: “Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund.""

Here is another quote from 2020 Berkshire shareholder meeting: “In my view, for most people, the best thing is to do is owning the S&P 500 index fund,” Buffett said. “There are huge amounts of money people pay for advice they really don’t need.”"

Based on this, I think $ZKIN will pay off really well in the next few years to come. They have recently set foot into the [NFT Marketplace](https://www.zkinternationalgroup.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/96/zk-internationals-subsidiary-xsigma-announces-its-nft), which is a giant in itself.

It is a pure-play on online gambling which has enormous growth potential as more and more states legalize online gambling. And unlike the other pure-play online gambling stocks, this company has already proven itself to be consistently profitable for multiple years.

The other big pure-play online gambling stock is DraftKings which currently trades at over 40 times more than Golden Nugget Online Gaming despite the fact that DraftKings is not even profitable yet whereas GNOG is a younger company that is still growing yet has already achieved consistent profitability.

2021-05-20 11:13:57,stocks,"$100 is not enough because the fees and commissions are relatively high, so you need to make that much more on each option to break even, let alone make a profit.  It would be much easier to go from $1000 to $100,000.

Given that, if you *do* make it to $10,000 from $100, you might as well go ahead and attempt the significantly easier challenge of  getting to $1,000,000 from the $10,000 you just made so, overall, you are going from $100->$1,000,000, which would give you significant bragging rights.

If course, if you manage that you really have to try it one more time and gamble it all up to $100m.  YOLO, after all.  At that point, it will be really hard to stop yourself from going for the $10b goal and then, finally, the $1t goal to make yourself the world's richest person. 

If you manage that last one, I urge you to put aside your original $100 before making  any more bets, so you will never have an overall loss.

2021-05-20 09:09:56,stocks,"The stock needs to have great news right away n start climbing up , in order to make big money on options. If not your money will loose value everyday as stock price moves side ways  and or very slowly upward."

No but seriously, it's risky as all hell and the little time I've been playing options, $100 is not enough. This could probably be possible w/$1000.

Either buying physical land with water present, water utility companies or something else. There’s quite a bit of research that shows in 2040 and beyond, a lot of the US and world is going to face severe water shortages. One problem is that I’m not sure if this is one of those things where there will be a difference between being right and actually being profitable. Still doing my research on it. I have a somewhat detailed thesis in my notepad if anyone would be interested in hearing my thoughts.

The other problem is trying to profit on people facing hardship which seems a little scummy. But you could argue everyone who shorted the housing market in 2007ish was doing the same.

2021-05-20 00:00:00,stocks,"Frontline - a tanker company that seems to do everything right in the last years  Frontline Ltd., a shipping company, engages in the seaborne transportation of crude oil and oil products worldwide. It owns and operates oil and product tankers. As of December 31, 2020, the company operated a fleet of 68 vessels. It is also involved in the charter, purchase, and sale of vessels.

Starting with a PE ratio of 4 and a PB ratio of 1 is always a good start. But then again most taker companies are now trading at a low PE ratio. Their net income, revenue and profit margin were increasing in the last 3 years which is a really good sign. One not so good sign is their debt which has increased from 1.8 to 2.2 billion in the last 4 years.

You could consider that shipping oil is not a good business anymore because renewables but changing to renewables cannot be done in an instant so the transition will be slow. For example the Chinese oil consumption reached an all time high in December 2020. In the same time a lot of companies have reduced their number of shipping vessels due to the low demand in last year. 

To take something from their SEC filling regarding risk:

“The demand for our oil tankers derives primarily from demand for Arabian Gulf, West African, North Sea, Caribbean, Russian and US Shale crude oil, which, in turn, primarily depends on the economies of the world's industrial countries and competition from alternative energy sources. Any decrease in shipments of crude oil or change in trade patterns from the above mentioned geographical areas would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Among the factors which could lead to such a decrease are:

• increased crude oil production from other areas;

• increased refining capacity in the Arabian Gulf or West Africa;

• increased use of existing and future crude oil pipelines in the Arabian Gulf or West Africa;

• a decision by oil-producing nations to increase their crude oil prices or to further decrease or limit their crude oil production;

• armed conflict in the Arabian Gulf and West Africa and political or other factors; and

• the development, availability and the costs of nuclear power, natural gas, coal and other alternative sources of energy. In addition, volatile economic conditions affecting world economies may result in reduced consumption of oil products and a decreased demand for our vessels and lower charter rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and our ability to pay dividends. “

I don’t really know how to evaluate these so I will let you evaluate them. They also say that “If the tanker industry, which historically has been cyclical and volatile, declines in the future, our revenues, earnings and available cash flow may be adversely affected.“ which basically means the earnings might go up or they might go down. The same is with the stock price.

Personally I think they will do well at least the next year because the demand for oil is still high, China is running on all cylinders because they need more and more energy, the airlines will start having more airplanes in the sky which will kickstart refineries and until “green solutions“ kick in we will need something.

This is just for information purposes, it is not investment advice, I am not an investing professional. Do your own due diligence before investing.

Have a good week!

2021-05-20 02:36:45,stocks,"Shipping stocks are interesting as short term bets or hedges, but their long term performance as destroyers of value (for certain stocks) scares me.  Many lost close to 90% of their value from 20 years ago, and I remember buying USS (US Shipping) a ways back for its 10% dividend, and it promptly going bankrupt."
2021-05-20 08:19:39,stocks,"The biggest issue with Frontline is that they're going to continue losing money at current rates, while they're in the middle of a massive expansion in the fleet that is fuelled by expensive debt. Normally when spot rates are this low and scrap prices are this high, operators with older ships will scrap them to save money, but that hasn't happened yet, to the confusion of all.

If spot rates increase Frontline will make a fortune. If they do not, they will rapidly approach bankruptcy as they have in years past. Price/Book is a useless measure in this case because of the massive spreads present when valuing and trading shipping assets. Every other shipping company that exists has a P/B > 1 but shareholders still lose everything when they go bankrupt, and tanker companies go bankrupt **a lot**.

With all of that said, they're so leveraged that an increase in rates could yield ludicrous profits, as we saw near the start of Covid. Two primary drivers to keep watch of are changes to the soon-to-be ratified EEXI, and tanker spot rates. Frontline has a much newer and more efficient fleet than most, are are well positioned relative to their competition, but they're taking on a huge amount of risk with their debt and exposure to spot pricing."

2021-05-20 07:34:09,stocks,Should have sold them short when they were at 300. But the carrying costs may have been a little high because at the time they were apparently paying a $500 a share dividend. It was before 2010. What could possibly go wrong.
2021-05-20 03:35:31,stocks,It has annual dividend of 2.00 per share and 24.75% yield which is what I like about this company 👍. I am waiting to buy it at right time.

Frontline leased out a large portion of their fleet to use as storage, at rates that are now 3x what we see today.

At current rates, they will likely lose an estimated $40M this year."

From what I remember, because the company is placed in Bermuda they are giving dividends only if free cash flow is positive. I might be wrong but please consider this"
2021-05-20 02:49:22,stocks,I do agree there.  Maersk/COSCO and others have already hit ridiculous and probably unsustainable highs (maybe short targets?).  Oil shipping hasn't joined them.  Maybe because everyone is thinking renewable energy and that oil is done.  But I agree that there could be a supply crunch and price spike when COVID sputters out and everyone wants oil at once.

Theoretically an FTD is anything that didnt clear, right? For a trade that is T+3 and an option contract its T+2. This info is generated by the SEC, but why isn't it generated by the clearinghouse?

Anyway here are some highlights so far for 2021: 
(taking price on report multiplied by shares FTD)
Nearly $306B in FTD securities value
*needs to be mentioned the SEC doesn't report sub penny
15,557 tickers had an FTD
21.9B shares are reported FTD

It surprises me to see ETFs, Spiders, and really this much volume. I am not new to the market, but new to this level of analysis. Is this normal? This just seems holistically inefficient. Would a real time, or near real time, clearing process resolve this mess? I believe it would.

2021-05-20 00:00:00,stocks,"Question about inflation and has it already been reflected in the stock market, or are we going to see prices skyrocket across multiple sect Hello all. I'm newish to investing. I'm 33 and have a general question about the recent massive influx of printed money and how that might affect stock prices going forward. Actually unrelated to that, I wonder, what is your opinion on this bull market ending and crashing hard? To the contrary, my mind is thinking that, in theory, isn't every stock undervalued right now due to the recent 4trillion in printed money, or have we seen the market respond accurately to that already?

If not, isn't it a no-brainer to invest in some top stocks in each sector? I'm starting to see prices everywhere start to slowly creep up in everyday life (fast food is insanely expensive now). I hear companies like BOA increasing their minimum hourly wage to $25 by 2025. I see Chipotle, Target and other companies like Amazon paying between 15-17 an hour for basic work.

Again, wouldn't this mean the current prices we're seeing in the stock market are technically ""undervalued"" and not accurate meaning they should all go up significantly in the next year, 2 or 5? Or will we see a sideways or bear market in the coming years?

I understand this is a broad generalization I'm making, but would like to get some more seasoned advice around the general theme I'm presenting. Thanks for reading.

If inflation kicks into high gear, $25 Trillion suddenly isn't quite that much.  
And the gov't also has given themselves the 'obligation' to keep markets high; millions of Americans have 401(k)'s and neither the individual not the gov't wants it to go down in value. It's almost a catch-22.

The stock market is anything but under valued. These levels terrify me. Have a look at the S&P PE radio...

https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio/table/by-month

Rising inflation means rising cost of living. As costs increase consumption (demand) decreases. As demand decreases, sales drop, earnings will follow and valuations will follow. Share prices will follow. Supply will correct and incomes will decrease as jobs are cut.

With respect to your comment regarding we have a shrinking labour pool as boomers are mostly retired (or close enough) and Gen Xers are the new boomers.

Wages are rising because of a supply/demand imbalance. Some may say it's the stimulus keeping people home. Maybe so for some but the macro trend is a shrinking labour force. Prior to Covid stimulus the US had 3.5% unemployment which essentially means anyone who wants to work has a job..... Or 2 since the minimum wage is barely above defined poverty at 2080 hours per year."

Who knows, maybe they end up putting in as much into the markets per month as some 30 year olds who can only put in several hundred a month after paying rent, groceries, etc.

They did NOT want to potentially let us go into a 1930's style depression. And it worked, for now. So is it a floor? I wish I knew. I think if markets took a big hit, the gov't would throw a lot more money at it to create a floor. But, we were never really weaned off the market fixes from '08-09. Interest rates were still really low, which greases asset prices (mortgages, stock markets, etc.)

Unpopular opinion part:

Thought experiment: Sure you can pay every worker out there 5$ per hour more - but what will happen? A dollar ""lives"" off of the difference a worker can achieve with it. Higher risk jobs will demand not just 5$ but an additional bonus on top for their riskier work until you end up with the same pay ratio as before. This takes ages however, which is why you can get away with it. Money can only work in a system with limited supply - as soon as you can create it from thin air it makes no sense. 

Now please change my view!"
2021-05-20 10:03:38,stocks,"You can't apply the same logic to the equity market that you do to consumer prices. Equities, and groceries are not the same ""stuff"". If a decision needs to be made to buy food or equities, I think we both know where the $ end up. The OP was asking if inflation would result in equity prices rising. There's no universal causal link there. 

Technically speaking equity prices are linked to current profitability and perceived future profitability (earnings growth). Inflation does not drive up earnings. It drives up Revenue and Costs. Not at the same rate, but eventually it levels out. Otherwise, we'd have infinitely profitable companies after decades of inflation....which we don't.

Bottom line is the OP asked about spreading out their investment across sectors. The answer is sort of yes. You should DCA into Equity Index ETFs and go play with your kids. Don't try to pick stocks. Inflation is not a tide that will make all boats rise."

I've got HD and UNH HON etc.

So is finviz a good place or is there better places, preferably for free to get various metrics of a stock?

Is there a place or book to learn about p/s p/b forward pe, eps growth, etc?

For example, what should I be looking for in eps growth yoy?  A certain percentage?  

Are earnings and eps the same thing?

What about price to sales?  What's a good ratio?

As a long term holder of AAPL MSFT HD UNH type companies do I really have to constantly monitor all these things?

I don't plan on selling any of those shares for many years.  Easier to just read Motley Fool and various articles, reddt, to keep up on my companies?  😆

Don't get me wrong.  I'd like to understand the various metrics, but would like to take my time and learn them one by one slowly I suppose.

But historically I've looked for a few things;.  
1) A P/E ratio of 15 or less AND a Forward P/E ratio that is *lower.* A lower FPE ratio means the company will be making more money next year than this year.  
2) Good inside ownership, especially from the top brass. They're looking out for the shareholders best interest, which includes themselves. Share buybacks are good, too.  
3) A decent dividend that is raised every year or so. The longer the history, the better.  
4) No debt. Debt can help a company to grow for a while, but it can eventually cripple the company.  
Many other investors will have their own criteria, but the points I mentioned are my favorite, and I have a hard time passing on a stock that meets those criteria.

Also, sometimes you just need to keep your ear to the ground. Right when Blackberry was starting to meme, they issued a PR saying they didn't know why their stock was going up, and that their CEO (?) had recently sold all of his shares. Never a good sign. My historical favorite has been AEO, and I do whatever the CEO does. His family has been in the industry for a few generations IIRC, and he always seems to know exactly when to buy at the bottom. He often also knows when to sell at the top. So I just follow that stock long-term. Sometimes I go 2-3 years without investing in it, then when it drops, I'll hit it hard. But I keep my eye on news articles every month or 2.  
And watch out for high dividend yields; they look nice now, but that can indicate a problem with the stock. Example: if the share price goes down 50%, the dividend yield goes up 100%. The company is much more likely to cut it to conserve cash. If you like high dividends tho, I found HRZN last year. They are a ""business development company's and regularly pay out 7-10% per year. The stock might be a little pricey now; I last bought at $13 and haven't bought more, since all stocks seem a little high. I'm kinda getting my toes wet with them and they're earning more and more of my trust with each passing quarter."

However, this number is *always* going to be an estimate and can easily change at any given time. It is also computer-generated, so you're trusting the technology is right. Sometimes for the best estimate, you may need to review the company's most recent earnings release, then see if they give an update on their expected future earnings."
2021-05-20 00:27:32,stocks,Thank you very much I'll be diving into that website asap! I do agree with you about the stock price movement to dividend heail ratio(if I worded that right) that's honestly so far my only metric I know to look out for since I do dividend stocks. I very much appreciate your time and info thank you very much. :-)
2021-05-20 00:00:00,stocks,Thoughts on selling low and reinvesting Several of my stocks are tanking. I don’t see ARKK or EXPI going up to the amounts I bought it (pretty high) anytime soon. Selling those at a loss would free up some money to then reinvest into something like VOO. I know there isn’t a way to predict the market but I am trying to figure out if this is a smarter way to reallocate my funds. I could get some of the money back through taxes but could still lose a good sum. Anyone else in this predicament and any advice as to what to think about?

2021-05-19 23:09:20,stocks,"One approach I've heard lots of people propose is let's say ARKK and EXPI are worth $10,000 in your portfolio today (down from whatever). If you had $10,000 of free cash today to invest, would you still invest in ARKK and EXPI? If yes, stick. If no, sell and move to something that you would invest in if you had $10,000 of free cash to invest.

Not saying it's the right or wrong way to handle the situation, but just another way to look at it."

2021-05-19 21:49:09,stocks,there’s no shame in taking a loss if you see better opportunity in the horizon.
2021-05-19 21:55:09,stocks,"Why did you buy these ETFs in the first place?  If that reason has changed, then sure, selling is a good idea.

From the way you’ve asked your question it seems like you want to sell because the price has gone down.  This is generally a terrible reason to sell a stock. 

If you think the businesses held in these ETFs are good businesses, perhaps it’s an opportunity to accumulate more.

I once bought 100 shares of NFLX at $60 and watched it drop down 20% over the next two months. But their business hadn’t changed in those two months, only the share price had.  So I bought 100 more.  

I’m up almost 900% on that investment now."

2021-05-20 01:25:00,stocks,"ETFs are to set and forget. If your timeframe is less than a minimum of 1 year then imho etfs is not for you. You will most likely have the same problem with VOO. I bought into VOO about 2 months ago and sure it has gone up and down but right now I am in the red on it. I am not too concerned because my timeframe is long term.

I’m similarly holding ARKK because again it might be down short term but long term you can bet it will trend higher. 

We can argue whether VOO will give you a better return vs arkk but quite frankly no one can say that for certainty. Personally I’m invested in both and feel both are good long term investments"

2021-05-20 00:00:00,stocks,"This might help some of you who question market fairness, or why a company might drop in stock price after excellent earnings. The reason you are frustrated / don't understand the results of market action is because of the time you entered the market likely. Millions of young new investors entered the market during the COVID shutdown.

This led to rates being extremely low due to the pandemic, stimulus (cash) available to more people than ever, and massive equity investments and buybacks. The end result is much of the stock market being now (overvalued) in profit taking range for major institutions. (who have a much larger impact on the stock market than retail investors) Nothing will make sense right now, and even in the near future, in fact it may very well get even more risky and volatile because rates being low and inflation are serious concerns.

Rates can't possible stay low forever and will climb at some point. Ask any experienced trader what happens when rates go up in the market... typically you see heavy selling action and an alternative switch of money from stocks to bonds/gold/or etc. Right now, you can have a FANG stock for example that can crush earnings and it doesn't mean they are fair game for a institution to not dump.

Why? because context is everything in this market, pull up a chart of major FANG's and see their progress the past year and a half, it's been quite the massive runup. That rollercoaster up, can, will and has effected the outcome of earnings in the present. The market is not just valued in the present by those who have the liquidity to move it, they value things in a more broad spectrum. 

Rates, Valuation of stock price, run up levels of the stock, future performance is relative to all of this to them. Just remember they hit the buy button when the stock was trading at an undervalued level, and hit the sell button at the top. They master this game, they have high speed computers, algorithms, its down to a science. You will NEVER be able to compete with them, but you CAN buy when they do at the low if you do your due diligence. Hope this helps those of you who question earnings results lately with market fairness."

I'm not sure *any* FAANG(M) has ""dumped"" after earnings lately. Google and Facebook both crushed it. Amazon slightly declined but didn't dump. Apple has downtrended a bit.

During the recovery, I learned that they hate higher interest rates. They also really hate inflation. They hate tech stocks when things they hate are happening (like inflation or interest rates). They hate high job numbers because economy is racing back, but also hate low job numbers because economy isn't racing back fast enough.

I understand most of that is connected, but what is the true catalyst of major selloffs in the tech industry? Fears of interest rate inceases? Is that their main fear and they're ready to sell at any potential hint at anything that could trigger rate increase?

Or is there something else they're scared of more than rates?

And is there an actual situation they like which encourages massive buying? Or is it just easier to short right now so hedge funds are pretending any little thing scares then but in reality the value of stocks are on the high side so they're riding them down before loading up and riding them back up?

This is so confusing. 

And can you also explain your tips on making low risk plays during market sell-offs? Like buying calls and hoping they land OTM?

A few unique ones:

FSI - Small but growing environmental company that makes a chemical that prevents excess water evaporation. PE of 14. I see a trajectory like that of ERII

MLHR - Herman Miller, maker of the Eames chairs. Iconic American brand. Mostly office furniture. But luxury. Also doing furniture for gamers with LOGI. Have maintained revenues but still priced below pre pandemic levels. Great reopening/office play. Just acquired KNL

BLBD - Another iconic American brand. Maker of Blue Bird buses, including electric ones. Already getting orders for them. Revenues down this year, but orders for the next decade will run like a banshee with need for NEW buses.

UGRO - This is another small company. Agroponics. Comparable to AGFY. But tiny market cap, recently uplisted, half market cap is cash on hand, growing and expanding internationally.

AHCO - Medical device company. Very under the radar. Ridiculous growth and acquisitions. Was featured in IBD not long ago

KLR - Very, very under the radar mini TWLO with a price multiple many times lower. Huge potential.

MOGO - A mini Sofi for Canada and international, too, now. Owns chunk of Coinsquare. Very undervalued IMO."

They have one of the lowest cost primary vanadium mines in the world (if not the lowest) and they make a purer vanadium concentrate than the benchmark, which is useful for some applications. 

The primary application is in steel production. A very small amount of vanadium can double the strength of a given weight of steel. A secondary (up-and-coming) application is in flow batteries, which are promising for long-term stationary energy storage--like that needed to balance renewable supply to the grid. Largo has acquired tech for vanadium flow batteries, and they are in the process of lining up production for these. 

Infrastructure plans being launched by various countries will increase the demand for both steel and storage. (See skyrocketing iron ore prices. Oh--also, Largo has a huge stockpile of low-quality iron ore as a byproduct of its vanadium production. They're trying to sell it, though at a discount to the 62% benchmark, as it's lower quality. But they have like two million tons of it.) Supply is already stretched, and historically the price for vanadium can skyrocket when supply/demand imbalance arises (currently at ~$8/lb, has hit $30 when stretched).

The reason why the price is kept low is their bad profit margins, which deserves a whole DD post by itself. I’ll try to summarize.

Maxeon spun off from its parent company, Sunpower. Sunpower had a contract signed more than 10 years ago, where they had to buy polysilicone at a fixed price. Right now, this price from the contract is much higher than the market price, and the contract was transferred to Maxeon. So until the end of 2022, they basically have to pay triple or smth like that the market price of this material.

When adjusting for the losses caused by this contract, MAXN should be profitable. I’m planning to accumulate stock until 2022. When the burden of this out-of-market polysilicone contract phases out, they will probably shoot up.

Check their earnings they are selling these things like hotcakes and I think this will continue to grow as people learn about sleep apnea more and more.

2021-05-20 11:57:20,stocks,"They haven't been booking solid profits (relative to their operational costs vs. sales prices) in recent quarters, for various reasons. 

Through their first years of production, they had a take or pay agreement with Glencore, a pretty massive mining conglomerate that took a healthy cut of their sales. (New miners make these agreements before they open because it makes it possible to achieve reasonable financing.) That expired after Q2 last year I think, so the direct effect of that should be almost done with their results, trailing PE-wise--except that it meant they had to start their own proprietary sales team to move the product themselves, and that they had to build up an inventory of product in the markets they sell to, which took some months. They figure to make a higher profit this way in the long run, but it has impacted the past year. 

Also, in Q1 this year they upgraded some of their processing equipment, which should let them produce more of their end product (V2O5) every quarter, but they had to stop production for a few weeks to do it.

Price should also be high relative to past 12 earnings because the price of the product is up relative to these past four quarters, with V2O5 now around $8/lb vs. around $5/lb over 2020. (In general, mining stocks are interestingly leveraged to the underlying product... Largo makes V2O5 for like $3/lb, so at $5/lb they make $2. At $8/lb they make $5... 150% increase in the profits because of a 60% increase in the underlying price.)

2021-05-20 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Stock Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 19, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 19, 2021**

The stock market opened deep in the red but managed to climb throughout the session to pare much of the losses. For example, the Nasdaq (QQQ) opened 1.73% down but managed to close the day 0.12% up. Despite the market declining modestly the last three days, it is encouraging to see volatility decreasing this week  after the wild swings the market experienced in the last few weeks. As said before, I thought the initial sell-off after the April Consumer Price Index was released was overblown for several reasons and am encouraged by this week’s price action.  

Leadership in equity markets has see-sawed between cyclical and value stocks and technology stocks, as market participants weigh the prospects for a strong economic rebound as the US economy continues to reopen with the possibility that the pick-up in activity may generate a surge in inflation. After leading the market higher in April, in the last month, the Nasdaq is down 4.77% compared to 0.79% down in the S&P 500. In my view, this dip could represent a great opportunity given earnings have been extremely strong and many companies have significantly raised guidance moving forward. 

The Federal Reserve released its April Meeting Minutes (basically a written record of what happened in the meeting), which said that “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals” and reiterated, for like the millionth time, that they did not believe a near-term adjustment of monetary policy was needed. Much of the recent volatility in the market is due to investors afraid that a surge in inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, so hopefully this commentary by the Fed can calm things down. [Read the entire meeting minutes here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210428.pdf)

However, it is important to note, the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report, which came in much weaker than expected (which bolsters the Fed’s argument that employment remains far from their goal) and the Consumer Price Index, which showed a greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices. That said, the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Fed’s view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be “transitory” and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are considered.

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Moreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

**Highlights**

* After declining in recent weeks, the sell-off in cryptocurrencies across the board intensified, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling below $40,000 after the People Bank of China (PBOC) doubled down on it’s stance and released a statement reiterating that digital tokens shouldn’t be used for transactions. The PBOC posted in their official WeChat account, “Virtual currencies should not and cannot be used in the market because they’re not real currencies”. It’s important to note the statement doesn’t have any new regulatory steps, according to Yu Lingqu, a vice director at the China Development Institute think-tank in Shenzhen. 
* Ford Motor (F) is expected to unveil an all-electric version of its bestselling F-150 pickup truck tonight
* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fifth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. 
* Nvidia (NVDA) is extending its cryptocurrency mining limits to newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards. After nerfing the hash rates of the RTX 3060 for its launch in February, Nvidia is now starting to label new cards with a “Lite Hash Rate” or “LHR '' identifier to let potential customers know the cards will be restricted for mining. NVDA offers a separate, specialized mining processor that has the best performance for mining but will not be able to handle graphics. 
* In a Ford factory in Michigan, President Biden promoted his $174 billion plan to promote and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles across the United States and planned to roll-back vehicle emission standards. According to the fact sheet, Biden's plan ""proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States” and backs grants to fund the retooling of shuttered factories ""to build advanced vehicles and parts.""
* Michael Burry, the investor famous for calling the 2008 housing market bubble and portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie “The Big Short”, recently unveiled a huge bearish bet on Tesla. Scion Asset Management, Burry’s firm, said in a regulatory filing it had put options on 800,100 shares of Tesla, as of the end of Quarter 1, a value of $534 million. Details on the strike price of the puts, their value and whether they are part of a broader trade are not publicly available.
* Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has sold nearly all of its Wells Fargo (WFC) stock, a position the company has held since 1989. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire said it owned just $26.4 million of shares of WFC as of March 31, down from around $32 billion in January 2018.
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday movement\*\***
* L Brands (LB) target raised by Barclays from $66 to $82 at Equal-Weight. Stock currently around $68

2021-05-20 02:33:47,stocks,"The weakness in growth equities, decline of the dollar, rise in CPI and commodities, Burry’s positions, all seem to indicate that the market does not in fact believe that inflation is transitory. 

The only ones I see saying inflation is transitory is the Fed (who are responsible for a good portion of any inflation due to their pro growth Covid policies) - why should we believe them?

My personal take is that it’s difficult to see how inflation can be fully transitory. One quick example - Let’s say you go to your local bar and they’ve increased the price of beer by $1 and chicken wings by $1.50. Do you see them reducing these “transitory” prices later?"

Reducing them later would be deflation,  Saying its transitory means the new prices will stay they just wont increase them again.  Ongoing inflation means every day/week/month prices will continue to increase."

When the pandemic started and everyone hunkered down, Zoom was the leading platform positioned to handle video chat, conferences, training, etc.

Immediately after, every industry started seeing specialized tools that covered the same functionality but with better featured for each industry.

By now, people and businesses that are still using online tools are evaluating and adopting specialized tools and abandoning Zoom.

I haven't done any data analysis on Zoom financials, but just on the premise of why they got big and how they are going to stop gaining ground, I don't see Zoom as a good investment this side of 2021. The time to jump in was first half of last year."

I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made.

Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 

The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 


At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.


With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.

But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher


This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.


An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 


Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 


While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 


This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.


This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 


Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 



**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards

I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes

TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+). The range may be coming to an end."

All the time now, a company performs well and the stock price drops because of it. Take Lowe's today for example. It blasted earnings. It literally doubled them. 8th earnings in a row it has smashed, and today it's down. Literally, you have a company coining it in, and the share price is dropping. (I dont own it btw, so this isn't a rant on that basis)

I know the argument is ""ThE WhoLE MaRkEt Is DoWn"". Sorry, no, I don't buy this bullshit.

Let's look at todays winners;

Advaxis is the 2nd biggest gainer today and is up 21%. It's a garbage fucking pennystock that trades at 0.58 cents. Even worse, it's a bullshit pharma stock. Normal volume is 6 million. Volume today - 166 million. There is no news to justify this interest

Mosys is the big winner so far, up 33%. Another bullshit $5 stock. Normal volume is 2 mil. No news, but today the volume is 30x the norm.

LifeMD has had lawsuits filed against it today, about claims its directors have comitted fraud. Even better;

**LifeMD appears to use unlicensed doctors to dispense OTC medications, has implemented an autoshipping/autobilling scheme, failed to honor guarantees, and put in place abusive telemarketing practices.**

So what does the stock do in response to this? Of course, it jumps 12%.

To end my rant, the 3rd placed highest today is another bullshit company, a Chinese medical company called Lianluo Smart. There's one single news article linking it to a takeover by newegg or something, the news article made little sense. Low and behold, normal volume is 400k, today it's 9 million. Even if the news is to be believed, this one single article was posted 1 hour ago, yet the price suddenly spiked 2 hours ago.

So, why do companies that do well, make money, smash earnings lose their stock value, and bullshit, nonsense companies get P&D so much. This is a daily occurance. Every single day I see a new company increasing its share price by 50%+ and it's nonsense. I thought P&D's were illegal.

They just make a note of what stock you wanted and then pass that order on to CITADEL through PFOF.  Citadel takes the short position opposite your purchases.  This short position (created as part of their market making activities) drives the price down.  The more retail customers buying through Robinhood (for sure seems to be doing this, dunno about other brokers) the more shorting pressure as the market maker takes the opposite short position to stay net neutral.   Between this and the fact that robinhood seems to not actualy buy your stock until you sell, sure seems like they are setup to automatically short whatever retail thinks is popular and has a net downward force on stocks.  They (Citadel) then uses Strategic Failure to delivers and doesn't even actually own the stock filling shares through borrowing from ETFs and other methods.  They may even be passing these shorts off as collateral on other securities.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ngun6e/proof_that_rh_scrambled_to_find_shares_during_my/

This post shows that during transfer robinhood is buying shares so they can actually transfer accounts and shares to other companies.  These are not the values the users bought at, which goes to show robinhood isn't actually buying shares when you buy through them.  (wonder why they have blocked coins and stocks at times?)  its cause they were going up and not down like their business model requires.  They got margin called and had that forgiven because they blocked buys...  

The markets are quite possibly completely fraudulent .  The brokers are all in on it constantly overselling stocks that get popular with no plans to ever deliver those stocks to you.  That's why the industry is all scared shitless about retail buy and hold strategy cause their business models count on you paper handing at the red bars and shit on your screens.  This is intentional and they use strategic fails to deliver to push out covering shares and driving the prices down until last minute when they finally cover.  Jumps on (what looks to be random days with no news), but fall 21 days after (or possibly 35 days) after big market days. Thats if they don't hide em in ETFs, or use the share borrow programs or whatnot.

Then they put out fake news headlines on their propaganda sites to subconsciously influence you to believe something that isn't true.  It could be as simple as, ""Gold due to kick off major gains due to inflation fears.""  You then buy manipulated paper gold or gold stocks and they short it, make money when it goes down due to unlimited phony shares, people sell and they profit.

What has happened recently is retail investors have banded together to play the same game and have made doing this risky for them.  What will happen in the future?  The government will make changes to make it easier for them to steal from retail investors.  The government has allowed this shit to go on for decades and people now know the government is in on the fraud also, so they are rebelling.

This is the beginning of a peaceful financial rebellion against a corrupt system.  What will happen in the near future (1-2 years), is people all over the world will lose faith in the US market, stop investing in socialized wealth distribution to the 1% with IPO, free money handouts, and will start their own blockchain markets.

In this case the ""whole market"" idea could be validated.  Overall though, I totally agree.  Stocks with great news seem to dip while those missing production marks soar to unheard of prices.  Confusing is an understatement."

2021-05-20 03:53:31,stocks,"You can’t compare the price movements of established companies and penny stocks. They are traded by different groups of people with often different motivations.

If the same shop sells both TVs and potatoes, it doesn’t means the price of the two products should be correlated.

It’s also mistaken to think that a stock should go up and down in a predictable fashion, like Good earnings = up. If it was so easy everyone would be rich … which means no one would (wealth, as in Buying Power, is relative)."
2021-05-20 04:03:55,stocks,"Another one of these posts... The market is not rational, it never was. Supply and demand is what defines the price. Lots of people have lots of cash and time to research the stock market. Money flows in until it flows out again. Banks and brokers realized that your customers bring no money if they don't trade, so they advertise investing everywhere.
My 90 year old grandpa came to me lately with a paper that states that he's now holding a fund with Apple in it - he doesn't even know what an iPhone is.

People yet don't understand what a cash flow and a EBITDA is, they just buy what they hear from friends or read on Twitter. Institutions play that and pump stocks before earnings, just to dump them once the news is out, whatever it might say. 

If you want to avoid it, you have to look behind the party tent. I bought some small caps in established markets not as fancy as tech or medical based on my TA just to calm down a little from this madness. I also hold some of the crazy stocks and ETFs so I might not be the most rational, but when I look for value and diversification I don't have to look for long."
2021-05-20 06:17:41,stocks,I feel like this rant boils down to you wanting to be able to make money day trading blue chips.
2021-05-20 06:37:25,stocks,"Put simply, there’s no way to predict the market.  Period.  Furthermore, market movers have info you will never have.  They do not research potential investments by reading the news, their process is quite extensive.  Finally, if your strategy is to follow the news you will always loose.  That’s old information.  The stock market is about betting on the future of a company, not how they did last quarter.
Finally, diversify so you can take advantage of the absurdities in the market."
2021-05-20 06:53:43,stocks,Why did I read this as earrings
2021-05-20 07:01:51,stocks,"I can explain from the very uneducated and objective mind:

The market is a human creation. Not an autonomous network. It's an idea that was created and cultivated by the richest and most influential people in the world. All concepts and practices that are created or performed at designed to expand, sell and distribute the wealth of the world's richest.

Sometime in the past 40 years the market opened up to small traders, the average joe, and the middle class sunk their hungry teeth into what was being sold as ""part of the American dream"". This market helped expand the wealth of the world's richest even further.

The idea that small money can be successful in the stock market is entirely dependent on that small money developing an incredibly narcissistic view on finance. After all, the entire system was designed by narcissists and sociopaths.

It's like playing poker at a casino now. The house will always make money, and out of the 100 people being dealt cards, only 5 or 6 will walk away will full pockets. The system isn't objective, fair, regulated, unbiased, or 'on the level'. It's designed to exploit compassion, fair play, and cooperation.

And it's not a conspiracy. It's animal nature. There are so many people who want it this way they collectively work towards it without needing to have a spoken understanding. Greed is a sin for a reason. And no it's not because it's bad for society (altho it is). It's a sin because just like now, the rich tried to convince the poor that trying too hard to be like them is wrong or bad and will lead to self destruction. It's not self destruction. It's the rich trying to crush possible competition. Which again, is just animal nature.

The more you understand the nature of what people are in any walk of life, the more you understand why anything happens."
2021-05-20 07:47:54,stocks,I honestly wonder if the behavior is driven by algorithmic trading.  It would be simple for an AI to learn that pump and dumps are highly effective ways of luring dumb money into a trade.
2021-05-20 08:10:18,stocks,"The explanation for your post is also the motivation to post it. You're clearly not investing long term, that means if everyone is trying to get the earnings bet soon and it doesn't spike they sell on fear, then comes the drop. Thing is..market is flooded on new investors that wants to see their gains soon, making it all very volatile and apparently way off the grid, but the surviving companies will thrive in the future."

We are stagnant and have very little growth in a normal year. The barriers to entry into this business are literally massive and if we quit producing tomorrow it would have a dramatic impact on western civilization.... but Mehh we aren’t a meme stock so therefore our company has little value to the current investors.

2021-05-19 20:18:34,stocks,"The reason you are frustrated / don't understand the results of market action is because of the time you entered the market likely. Millions of young new investors entered the market during the COVID shutdown. This led to rates being extremely low due to the pandemic, stimulus (cash) available to more people than ever, and massive equity investments and buybacks. The end result is much of the stock market being now (overvalued) in profit taking range for major institutions. (who have a much larger impact on the stock market than retail investors) Nothing will make sense right now, and even in the near future, in fact it may very well get even more risky and volatile because rates being low and inflation are serious concerns. Rates can't possible stay low forever and will climb at some point. Ask any experienced trader what happens when rates go up in the market... typically you see heavy selling action and an alternative switch of money from stocks to bonds/gold/or etc. Right now, you can have a FANG stock for example that can crush earnings and it doesn't mean they are fair game for a institution to not dump. Why? because context is everything in this market, pull up a chart of major FANG's and see their progress the past year and a half, it's been quite the massive runup. That rollercoaster up, can, will and has effected the outcome of earnings in the present. The market is not just valued in the present by those who have the liquidity to move it, they value things in a more broad spectrum. Rates, Valuation of stock price, run up levels of the stock, future performance is relative to all of this to them."
2021-05-19 20:18:54,stocks,"80% of market movement is sideways and choppy. If you miss the 5 days out of the year with the largest upmoves then you would have a flat portfolio. This is what a normal market looks like.

2021-05-19 20:19:36,stocks,"There's so much happening in the broader market that is causing this. I need go to bed soon, have to be up at 3:30 a.m. EST for work. Today was just a teaser of what's coming. Look up CMBS and how poorly they're situated. Look up net accounts, and what they mean relative to CDOs. Learn about credit swaps and how the repo market works. Research how repo and bond markets are currently positioned. Look into record-breaking bond offerings by banks recently. Ask yourself, why? What event is provoking banks, brokers, and hedge funds to shore up cash liquidity at record levels? What do they know? Follow the money!

Look at recent DTCC, NTSCC, and OCC filings/rule changes. Research what these rules mean and how they apply to major players. Who has a seat at the table? Who does not, but wants one? Learn what those regulatory bodies are and what they do. Why are they changing the rules? Study up on margin calls, and try to forecast which banks, brokerages, and hedge funds may be at risk to be margin called. Why are they at risk? More importantly, which positions are they most overleveraged in? This is important because those short and/or unprofitable positions will be the positions that will be initially ignored (except for extremely underwater puts), upon margin call. Counterintuitively, their profitable, long/call investments will take the most damage during a margin call, because these positions will get liquidated first, to cover margin. Understand how the money works. Who will buy up these fire sales?

Why did crip toe get obliterated across the whole market today? Why do companies with blowout earnings keep dumping? Why is it that the moment the media finally mentioned the inflation, that's been happening for months, it began to slide a bit? Why are incredibly overleveraged U.S. treasuries creeping up? Why is money moving in non-traditional directions? Also, where/whom is it moving from? Where/whom is it moving to? Why?

Research these things and find the answers. Then spend a day and watch The Big Short three times in a row. Then, read over your research from these comments and questions a few times. Finally, spend another day watching The Big Short a few times, research in-hand, and take notes. Read the research again, along with these new notes. It should be blaringly obvious at that point. You should be ""JACKED TO THE TITS,"" if you figure it out. If not, post questions here, and I'll do my best to answer most of them in a timely manner.

There is absolutely nothing to justify that sixty billion dollars over a pre pandemic high market cap. Lowe’s has $24B in LT debt and a shareholder equity of 1.4B. 1.4 billion. The fucking book value of this stock is 4 dollars. So today’s earnings were great for sure they will need 47 years or 564 quarters just like it to get to current valuation of $136B.

Now when the fed removes seven trillion from their balance sheet and raises rates we get a catastrophic depression where we trade back towards nominal valuations about 70% lower from current levels."

2021-05-19 20:36:38,stocks,"Well, for starters, anytime you play earnings it's a 100% gamble. There is no arguing that. However, if you're looking at earnings for more incentive to invest your money (not trade, but invest) then there's more value to you in what the earnings report. 

Like the top comment said, the day to day stuff is usually market sentiment. It comes in waves. Penny stocks pump and dump occasionally, and it seems like it's penny stock season again. 

If you're looking to make a quick buck on earnings, there is no such thing as DD. NFLX can do outstanding and still dump 10%. TSLA can do horrendous and jump. Why? Doesn't matter. Don't bet on something that relies heavily on an earnings report (e.g weekly calls expiring the same week of earnings). Instead, maybe just read the earnings report and if you think it indicates growth, invest. If not, then don't (or sell if you're already holding a position). After all, companies don't report earnings so options traders can win big or lose big. They have to report to let investors know if theyre worth their money or not."

If the analysts following the company think it’s doing shit, beating expectations does not mean it would justify current valuations or even go higher. Market is currently reevaluating all these companies trading at x100 P/E. 

Not to mention, most of the time it comes down to a certain metric for most companies, like subscriber growth or E-commerce growth. EPS is not the end all be all."

Otherwise, what's the difference if a company grows 20%, 50%, 100%? All sound great. But you need to see what the market is expecting to see if the stock will go up/down.

Sometimes traders will front run a good result and you could get a sell the news phenomenon, but generally the above rules hold true."
2021-05-19 20:46:37,stocks,Well said! I couldn't have said it better!

These fears have pushed a sell off which was most definitely expected and needed. If your invested in companies with a solid future decreasing stock prices should make your mouth water and if you are planning to buy some they could now be at a discount(I don’t believe the market has dropped enough yet for most)."

""Sell in May and go away."" 

The whole market is indeed down. Stocks rose in May, so a lot of people are selling towards the end of May. 

Institutional investors might be doing some rotation and locking in profits. Couple that with retail investors possibly looking to put money into more speculative stocks, and this is what you get.

When everything is going down, a few anomalies may get propped up. 

To put things into perspective, the SP500 is still over 4000 points. Looking from the ATH, this isn't even a correction yet. 

To begin with, you shouldn't put faith into the market because you will inevitably lose that faith. Markets are what they are. If you own index funds, pullbacks just mean dollar cost averaging. If you own individual stocks that you liked at X price, then, provided you have liquidity, you should absolutely adore that stock at 0.8X. My personal favorite stock has dipped below my previous average price and I've been buying that dip for almost a week now. It just keeps dipping and I'm running out of liquidity, but I honestly don't care because I've read zero news about why it's going down - so this is just an opportunity for me."
2021-05-20 01:09:09,stocks,"Big investors are hesitant to put more into stocks in the current economic climate, everything is over saturated.

The casino has always been designed to make you lose, while the stock market is just a universal chaos that does not care if you win or lose. Like you said, the stock market should reliably, at least foremost, reflect its company’s earnings. Right now it is as if profits are tertiary to a company’s listing price, they barely have any bearing; and in many cases like you said, they can be crushing their expected earnings and still rank their stock.

Others get freaked out and they sell too. There's your pump n dump."

The most common group is the one that will bet on another B, makes sense. While no one knows if the student will reach it again, it's likely. Now it depends on how school performance goes overall. If it goes up for everyone and the student still receives a B, then the student kept up its success, but didn't improve its performance like all others. The value stayed the same. Meanwhile a student that went from a D to a B quadrupled its value. At the same time, since all students perform better, a lot of people expected the student to also perform better and receive an A, so the bets on the student for an A increases. Grades come out, it's again a good and consistent B, but those expecting an A jump off. There is always a group that plays on the student receiving an A or C, each year, but depending on how all other students perform the groups shift in size a lot."
2021-05-20 03:43:52,stocks,"The short answer my friend is bc the deck is stacked and the blatantly don’t care if we know. 
The market has nothing to do with financials , earnings , the economy or anything else. It’s a fascade. The markets are moved by the algos. Waiting in the gap. Scanning our Reddit feeds Twitter posts and even putting bot comments out there about shorts that are not coming from who u think they are. 
They are playing you if u think the earnings mean anything. 
Wall Street is simple. Use mass media to move the majority consensus. Then play poppising hand. Example “tech stock crashes get out now”. This means they are coming to tech most likely. They need to move the money basically. It’s not noticeable if they create a sell off of paper hands. The massive sell off accompanied by the large influx of revenue bye WallstreetaOnly result in a slight movement in price action.. They move their money to the sector it’s about to pop off good anybody up for shares for next to nothing when we sell. Don’t look for value. Look at volatility. Look at the expected move to follow the money. Algos wait for certain things to happen. These conditions are met the trigger a billion plus into a security. Hard to bet against that"

2021-05-20 03:47:20,stocks,"You're not wrong.  Look at this [chart](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V)

What does it mean?  It means the economy as a relation to money stock, is shrinking.  The economy is not shrinking, we know.  It's not really growing either.  Kinda stagnant.  Money stock is growing incredibly and at unprecedented rates.   Fairly obvious.  This is the great MMT experiment.  

But what does it mean for asset valuations?  If the economy is shrinking to money stock, do earnings matter?  Earnings being the profit on the relatively shrinking economy.  Earnings are becoming less and less relevant.   Isn't it more about who controls the money stock?  If that's the case, isn't a casino mentality a better mindset than worrying about what few cents on the dollar X company gained or lost this quarter?  It is better to attempt to manipulate asset pricing to garner more share of the ever growing money stock, than it is to worry about earnings in an economy that is shrinking in relation. 

This chart shows no sign of reversing and we have no reason to believe it will.  If you want to see how clueless the Fed is about the situation, read this [article.](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2016/04/a-plodding-dollar-the-recent-decrease-in-the-velocity-of-money/?utm_source=series_page&utm_medium=related_content&utm_term=related_resources&utm_campaign=fredblog)  You don't need to read it all, just look at the date and the last sentence. 

Maybe some don't understand the importance of money stock.  Why does it matter?  Sure, the economy is shrinking relatively, but not nominally.  Why do more dollars, that are clearly not entering into this economy, matter?  They matter because money stock could also be called political power.  Especially in the US where buying politicians is legalized, money represents political capital.  

The economy has no power as it shrinks.  The economy is what the government taxes.  It too will shrink as a result.  The people who have the money are rising in power.  He who controls it, controls all.  It's something worth gambling for."

2021-05-20 04:09:19,stocks,">LifeMD has had lawsuits filed against it today, about claims its directors have comitted fraud. Even better;  
LifeMD appears to use unlicensed doctors to dispense OTC medications, has implemented an autoshipping/autobilling scheme, failed to honor guarantees, and put in place abusive telemarketing practices.  
So what does the stock do in response to this? Of course, it jumps 12%.

  
I understand your frustration on the general market OP, but perhaps I can defend the LFMD stock because of my personal DD and holding positions in the stock itself since April.  
The lawsuits are based on a short report by Culper Research, with claims that have unfounded evidence against LifeMD. The company have since issued statements to refute the claims, and additionally SUED the institution! 

  
The company itself posted spectacular earnings for Q1 recently, with revenue up 323% YOY, and have increased revenue guidance for AY2021. 

  
With LifeMD's fundamentals getting better, having good catalysts lining up (news of endorsement from celebrities Kate del Castillo and Bellamy Young, receiving grants, information of INSIDER BUYING, and institutional holdings increasing to 34%), and having the current consensus from 2 analyst of a 12-month PT of $37.50, it is IMO a reasonable justification for its performance in the past few days. Granted, I was also surprised by the huge jump in such a short frame of time, but nonetheless it is expected.

  
I do agree that this market seems to be more and more driven by ""memes"" and WSB gambles, but I believe that there are still good companies that will give back to their investors in the long run, regardless of the noise and the hype in the short-term

2021-05-20 04:21:50,stocks,"Yes, its called stock. Next thing closest to a cat."
2021-05-20 04:23:43,stocks,"From first principles:

So first, there was stuff. Gourds, food, cool rocks, mountains, whatever. But there wasn't quite enough stuff for everybody at some point, and also fuck Steve, because Steve's a dick and he can't have any of these cool rocks I found or food from that cool tree I know about.

So, ownership isn't, like, an inherent physical trait of a thing. It's a matter of agreement, and frequently when this agreement can't be established, it's solved with pointy sticks/bioweapons/icbm's or whatever. It's cool; Steve was a dick and nobody misses him, and also he died back in the mists of prehistory and probably wasn't named that, but we don't respect him enough to think about it too hard.

From ownership we get trade, the transfer of ownership, the agreement that ""I used to own this and you now own this and for whatever reason , that changed without either of us stabbing/nuking one another"", probably because Steve wasn't involved, so if anyone says that thing is mine because they were out of town when we agreed, I'll correct em! Because I'm not Steve.

and from trade we get money, an abstraction a bunch of people agreed on, because bartering is fucking tedious. Like steve. But what *is* money? It's..  just another agreement, right? But this one is less about trust in your neighbors about what goes where, and more like a religion. But a religion about people. It's faith that people will still think the thing is cool tomorrow. For a while, some of the first money was just barter goods that everybody always wanted, like salt or something else that keeps well and is necessary for life. But those things Cary from place to place, so if I from my prairie hut try to trade with some desert nomads and they try to pay me in salt, I'm gonna be fucking pissed. So instead it was based on bullshit arbitrary things; lies a bunch of people bought into. Maybe that thing is shiny rocks, or the us government, or crappy math that draws more power than a mid sized nation. Whatever. But part of what makes a thing cool is other people liking it, right? So money is kind of also a popularity contest. And a religion. But it's convenient, so instead of getting rid of it we mostly just argue over which thing is cool instead of if this stuff is cool.

Stocks are... Okay so originally, they came with a percentage of the corporate income and stuff. But at some point that mostly stopped. Some stocks still pay dividends? But mostly not, and those are nothing compared to the potential profits from the natural churn, so most people don't really care. So it's mostly just money, but instead of dead ~~imperialist warlords and slavers~~ presidents, we get our favorite brands in the pieces of paper our numbers represent! Lowes! Nvidia! Enron! And also if you try to buy a pizza with it, it probably won't work.

So. At this point, the stock market is *a few* layers of abstraction outside of literally anything, right? And you've got a thousand kinds of money that can only buy other money. And you're just getting things against-

So yes it's a casino. It's literally just a casino. It's poker, not roulette, there's skill involved, but it's a casino. No value is being created, and it blows up every couple years and causes a recession."

And it works. They short the fuck out of the entire market, spread their FUD and everything goes down. They make a ton of money and retail investors who are a lot less likely to short a stock (a lot of smaller platforms like Webull won't even have a way to short sell for us retailers) pay the bill. Which after th whole GME and Wall Street Bets thing exposed their duplicity and market-maker shenanigans is just what they want.

I had Athabasca oil stock since 2016 and my average was around 1.70. I believed in the company and it's assets but with oil declining and their cost of production high it was getting hit. When it reached around 0.15 cents i acquired more to lower my average which is now 0.80 cents. The stock is hovering around 0.70 cents now. In long run i will be on positive side.

Also i do have a strategy of investing around 10% in high risk and high reward stocks but that after doing some dd. You might win or you might loose it all.

2021-05-20 09:00:34,stocks,"The bottom line is this: in no other time in human history has the average man had such access to his money. He can move everything he owns at the push of a button. Previously there was a broker who had to input the order and, while I am NOT supporting brokers, they did have a stabilizing effect on the market.

""Are you sure you want to do this.. here's why I think it's a bad idea"" etc.

Now, the average man works. A lot. He wants a piece of the pie but he's working so much (or he's just lazy) he refuses or doesn't have time to actually learn why things have value. The ""fundamentals"". So, what does this leave him to make his decisions with?

Emotion (aka ""marketing""). He has nothing else to base his decisions on.

 Ex: I held my Bitcoin through all the movements from 2011 and through yesterday (still have them today) because I learned the tech and knew it was going somewhere. I also sold my doge the first time elon talked about it and it spiked because I also knew it was a joke and shouldn't go anywhere long term.

If you learn, you can weather the ups and downs. You know what's going on, you know why it has value, you know why you should own it. You'll hold through anything.

I tried explaining why someone on Facebook should teach their kid how to pick things based on management, fundamentals and usability and got told, literally, ""piss off boomer"" by someone else in the thread. It's an eye opener to where the market is headed.

Now, long term, like 20 years down the road, I worry this will affect the markets as the young guys who get burned now are going to be market shy later. That's money that won't flow in to the market because they'll blame the market for their losses and not themselves and their lack of knowledge. Since I'm 43 and not actually a boomer, this will affect me as well (at least I hope :) ). We'll see how this plays out I guess."

It could be that with those companies you're talking about that people had invested in them with the expectation that they would net 10x or something in a very short period of time and their stellar earnings were not enough to drive gains like that. 

Also could be that x% gains were already baked into the price but earnings just didn't live up to those expectations. Especially if the company was bought at a bargain during COVID with the expectation that the company would get back to pre-COVID prices, but they just haven't. Although I don't know if that's the case with the companies you mentioned."

Once I learned this for myself and took emotion out of the equation things have been much better.  People are not rational, they are ""normal"" just like behavioral finance will tell you.

2021-05-20 02:00:08,stocks,"Is this a golden rule for value investors because apple, google, microsoft and home depot has a similar PE and PEG."
2021-05-20 00:05:45,stocks,"Really helpful. I’m trying to learn more about fundamentals behind a stocks value, but the data on Y finance is tough to navigate, and missing on many companies"
2021-05-20 12:26:00,stocks,"PEG can be a good indicator, but look how it is trending, not just in one instance like this guy suggested. Plenty of reasons to buy higher PEG companies, ie long term earnings growth potential (peg usually only looks at one year out, if not taking the CAGR of historical years (which in theory shouldn’t impact the price today)). So in short, no magic bullet like this guy will lead you to believe"
2021-05-20 12:27:46,stocks,"Also yahoo finance tends to just look at GAAP numbers which can be impacted by one time items such asset sales and lawsuits, not pure operational results which analysts tend to strip out when forecasting"
2021-05-19 22:26:25,stocks,This is the answer.
2021-05-19 20:46:33,stocks,"Agreed, I don’t think people want to recognize that even for companies who had a great underlying 2020 that multiple expansion outpaced actual performance."
2021-05-19 21:26:02,stocks,This is the right answer.
2021-05-19 23:41:00,stocks,Plus the market is filled with people who bought HD months or years ago and now looking to realize those gains.
2021-05-20 02:26:53,stocks,"I had to scroll down too far to find the first post explaining that yes, your stock is probably already overvalued. Know what you’re paying for."
2021-05-20 02:46:26,stocks,It’s only up that much because there was a crash that sent it down 50% a year ago. I still agree with your point that if you zoom out there’s steady growth but not factoring in why it’s up 30% in six months is just as deceptive
2021-05-20 13:24:40,stocks,"I see you are very woke, may I borrow your tinfoil hat I left mine at home 🦍"
2021-05-19 22:10:33,stocks,fwiw in theory algo trading reduces volatility.
2021-05-20 13:40:51,stocks,"Great comment.  Very detailed and accurate at painting a picture of what is really going on.  This is why retail investors only option is to hold long term.

2021-05-20 00:29:15,stocks,"Dont forget to put your tinfoil hat on. 

GME hasnt been the talk of the market since its squeeze in January. It has no effects on the rest of the market whatsoever"
2021-05-19 20:44:15,stocks,Or simply invest in an index fund and beat out 90% of hedge funds and actively managed portfolios? Wall Street makes more money due to scale (trading hundreds of billions of dollars) and fees/

2021-05-20 04:05:14,stocks,Hi bub
2021-05-20 04:19:04,stocks,I mean gold can’t really be pumped and dumped electronically second after second. And gold can’t really be shorted either. Stocks should be unavailable to short and a software system should regulate price based on interest rather than blackrock investors waiting for Friday to make a paycheck... 🤢🤮

2021-05-19 22:20:13,stocks,The AI has achieved sentience. It has decided to tank Lowe's stock value. Is the AI doing this to protect humanity or harm it? Only time will tell.
2021-05-20 10:33:29,stocks,maybe ban algos from trading then.
2021-05-20 04:30:21,stocks,I know a physicist who was on a team that built an algo for a wall st bank that was trading few thousand times a second
2021-05-20 11:11:17,stocks,Algos can certainly trigger runups/selloffs which are then acted upon by other algos as price action is inputted.. it sounds like you’re saying they’re some sentient skynet AIs making deals with each other on the fly tho lol
2021-05-20 13:09:38,stocks,"I used to work for an electronic exchange.  The amount of nonsense I would see ... price prodding, data scraping, gamification, front-running... really opened my eyes.

I was on our trading desk when the 2010 flash crash happened, people were freaking out.  I know a guy who worked at another MM that crossed some of the trades that led to that crash.  They had zero idea what was happening in the moment.

I am convinced that the market could be morphed into something that actually valuations closer to ""fair"", instead of this insane microsecond-level nonstop churn by robots fighting with each other.  That ""provides liquidity"" but that's always the excuse.  Too much volatility introduces instability, too.

The solution is to slow exchanges the fuck down, like engine governors in NASCAR.  The solution is to tax the shit out of people who hold positions for 5ms.  The solution is a penalty box for people who gamify the system and front run.  But don't hold your breath.

The truth is, there are very powerful interests who like it this way, because they basically scalp every dollar of dumb money who doesn't have the bots and the ability to cross at light-speed while others are on foot.  

They are capitalists in the sense that they want to profit by turning everything into arbitrage, not in the sense that they want fair valuations and a fair fight.  Stock picking is hard, they don't want or need to do that to make money."
2021-05-19 20:35:01,stocks,"That's quite an interesting strategy. I think there is a lot of merit to this. It would end the micro-second algo traders and seems like it would curb a lot of manipulation almost instantly. The only problem I foresee is adequate enforcement of it. The SEC seems to do nearly nothing to protect the integrity of the markets.. otherwise, they'd likely be pushing for a sensible solution such as this."
2021-05-19 22:17:29,stocks,Or just put a fee on every individual trade. Make it like 25 cents or something really low. It won’t really affect anyone that’s actually investing themselves regardless of wealth. But it will affect the hedge funds using algorithms and bots that are making millions of trades every day to scalp and manipulate prices.
2021-05-19 21:07:55,stocks,"If the algos make the market irrational, why complain?  Just buy the stocks that the algos press down unreasonably, and sell when the algos push the price unreasonably high."
2021-05-19 21:25:14,stocks,But they also provide liquidity for the day trader
2021-05-20 11:48:13,stocks,"As Musk said, he doesn’t understand why people lose money trading. All you do is buy when it’s down and sell when it’s up."

2021-05-19 20:26:05,stocks,Wasn’t it called day trading or something? Like if you tell someone you’re a Day Trader they auto think you’re just a lazy wanker that stays home all day…wanking?
2021-05-20 11:14:08,stocks,Bingo
2021-05-19 21:25:30,stocks,I do indeed. I'm currently going long term in tech such as HPQ and AMD and I've been day trading in the steel and retail apparel sectors with MT and ZEUS for steel and LEVI and HBI for retail apparel. I'm not going to post my numbers (I don't like to kiss and tell lol) but you can rest assured there is more green than red in my portfolio
2021-05-19 22:19:40,stocks,"For long term investment, you are right. However, when swing/day trading you should be paying attention to those highs and lows in an attempt to forecast moving averages and support points which are crucial to making informed decisions on when to buy and sell in the short term"
2021-05-20 09:53:04,stocks,"“It’s priced in” is such a crock of shit.

ICLN was priced in when it crashed from low $30s to $20. Biden had a ton of papers to sign in his desk, clean energy should have been one, but no, because “it was priced in” apparently it was priced in during the Trump administration where it went from $10 to $33 in a year. 

We get a president who actually makes a mention of clean energy and it falls 30%+ but that’s ok it was priced in.

NCLH got slaughtered last week. Good news about most of the rooms being booked, stock goes down anyway, nearly 11% iirc. Next day is earnings. Can’t fall any lower, it was priced in from the bad reaction to good news right? Lol no you’re wrong, falls another 5%. The CEO cries like a bitch about the CDC rules... must be bad publicity stocks gonna go down right? Nope it goes up, fucking my puts.

So the whole “sentiment” and it’s priced in is clearly bullshit."
2021-05-19 22:28:59,stocks,"I think you make some good points, particularly your point on wsb stocks only being good for short term. I feel that one of the major misconceptions of the stock market is that all trading works similarly and that there are only 1 or 2 styles of trading. In reality there are many different trading methods and all of them are valid for different scenarios. You have to make a plan that fits the situation not look for a situation that fits your plan.

Edit: changed a few typos"
2021-05-20 01:57:15,stocks,"If you read closely  I said ""less affected"" not unaffected. Nobody here is trying to say this shit isn't complex as hell and that there are not a lot of things that can cause price change in either direction, it absolutely is complex and almost anything, including the weather depending on the sector you are investing in, can cause a price change. My original point was that, in a general sense, companies that have good earnings tend to go up over long periods of time, day to day or even throughout the day, rises and falls are more likely to be due to current stock movements then due to earnings. All of the examples you gave are great examples of exceptions to that and are totally valid, they are in fact part of market sentiment because traders will tend to buy shares before a company releases an earnings report if they think it will be positive as an example"
2021-05-20 02:39:53,stocks,"Yes to some degree, in order to sell high someone has to buy high and vice versa, but this is basically what market sentiment is, large volumes of orders for a company's stock at a certain price will create support that the price then bounce off of and so forth. This is in a lot of cases how the hedge funds manipulate stock prices, by putting so much money into either a long play that creates support and bounces the price up, which because they invested like billions they made like millions, or they short a stock so heavily that it falls. Essentially they put forth so much volume that it mimics market sentiment."
2021-05-20 11:57:38,stocks,"Well for one I think you have been paying attention to WSB and the news too much, there are lots of companies making money right now especially as covid numbers in North America and Europe go down. Secondly, if you really believe that everything is going down then start running shorts. #1 misconception about the stock market is that you can only make money when stocks go up, if you can pick good shorts you can make money no matter what the stock does. You have to make your plan fit the situation, not look for a situation that fits your plan"
2021-05-20 11:18:07,stocks,If you say so
2021-05-20 11:17:38,stocks,What about them?
2021-05-20 00:48:37,stocks,Short term trading is probably not worth it. Just keep it simple and buy stocks i like.

2021-05-20 13:40:07,stocks,A tinfoil hat and a little digging would make anyone walk away from stocks and the corruption that follows . That’s my opinion of course and I have only been into trading for 6months so not anyone worth believing. I have just been witnessing the BS first hand and will never invest after the squeeze unless it’s back into #AMC and #GME for the long haul but the markets definitely corrupted with all the back door trading and price manipulation.  The entire market will fall hard before the squeeze so I guess we sit back and see if this is the reason for the red days we are having . 🤞 if not I’m still out .
2021-05-20 10:27:00,stocks,"The SEC is still having hearings about GME, even this week. It does have an effect. DTCC and other entities are changing some of their rules based on what was discovered during these hearings. There is a clear effect on the market here, maybe not in your particular stocks but on the market yes"
2021-05-20 08:57:25,stocks,Gonna eat your words in about a month or two. What happened in January was never a squeeze. Gme to 10 mill! 💎🙌🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-19 20:37:59,stocks,No. Not at all. It’s used to be a smaller wealth gap and a middle class actually existed. So playing long term was no problem. Poor mfs like me need money now and we squeeze all we can until hedges try to make us poor. 😂
2021-05-20 11:48:00,stocks,I don't understand your comment. Your audience here is a person who just began studying the market. Who would face liquidity issues? What is a spread?
2021-05-19 20:02:05,stocks,This makes sense. Every algo is programmed to react to certain conditions. The end result is one big bot. MEGA BOT.
2021-05-19 20:15:20,stocks,"Engineer that studied simulations of systems. Even in very large networks with each node acting randomly, but dependent, creates harmonics. Think of a flock of birds going to work in a factory. An example is queue theory where a store goes from being dead one minute to busy the next. In reality simulations tend to have a half life where interference of people to prevent disaster leads the forecast astray.

Where things go wrong is the more aligned the naturally random nodes are, the harder they will break down the system once unity is lost. Its like pushing down further on a spring and building up pressure. The reason for this tends to be a lack of a reservoir to buffer because in order for a reservoir to form there has to be a gap between input and output. Unity means there is equal input & output.

The number one risk of trading bots is they can trip themselves into a crash without anyone understanding why. There really isn't a reason other than system dynamics. The more we rely on bots the more we are susceptible to them crashing the system."

2021-05-20 05:28:13,stocks,"If you tax microseconds, HFT will just hold positions longer. More price movement can happen within that time, so they’re just going to increase the bid-ask spread to cover that volatility risk. That means higher transaction fees for everyone."

2021-05-20 05:32:13,stocks,"That tax will just be passed along. Current bid-ask is 100.00 and 100.02. New bid ask with a 25 cent tax is now 99.75 and 100.27, or could be closer if you’re trading higher quantities that offset the tax."

2021-05-20 08:39:32,stocks,"I went to an art show/rave in Brooklyn about a dozen years ago. It was held in a huge water front warehouse. One exhibit had many ropes anchored to the floor and running up the walls to pulleys. 

From there, they connected to/controlled a giant marionette. 

There were many ropes attached to the wrist but they were far enough away that No Single Person could control or coordinate them all because they were too far away - sometimes on opposite walls. There were hundreds of ropes strung to the ceiling connecting to different body parts but in the dark and in the web of ropes, it was impossibly to see them all/the big picture.

Your situation with the bid ask adjusting would only make sense if quantitities of 1.

This would really only punish the bots trading absurd volumes with each other back and forth that nobody really understands what they’re even doing. You could then also apply the fees as a tax refund to anyone under a certain income or wealth bracket. 

Allowing algorithms to run the vast majority of volume is eventually going to cause a massive problem. It’s happened before where they caused a flash crash for no real reason. This time it’ll be much worse because of how much bigger it is. Hell they could even end up in a positive feedback loop instead and cause prices to skyrocket in seconds.

2021-05-19 22:03:11,stocks,"The concepts are similar, incidents with bridges are due to resonance which is essentially forces forming unity of a single frequency whose amplitude exceeds the bridges capacity.

System harmonics is like an orchestra where each player can play their own song and adapt at any time. Eventually some natural order forms from the chaos and a symphony is heard. This also happens in factories where there is high dependency and minimal buffers of time. This is actually a bad thing.

Once a symphony is formed it creates a feedback loop that reinforces the symphony. The players in the symphony tend to repeat themselves because what they did before obviously worked. Eventually they stop paying attention and don't worry about reserves.

When one player or node eventually moves out of phase the system tries to maintain harmony while the symphony begins to crash and soon the music stops because nobody knows what's going on rather than each node focusing on their own song. This happens in factories way more than people realize. Its why Toyota as an example works insanely hard to crush variation and enforce rigid supply methods so there is no song, its just a hummmmm.

Algo trading is exactly the same. They create a self fulfilling feedback loop that may be so many layers deep it seems nonsensical, it may in fact be nonsensical, but its in harmony with the symphony. Eventually it works so good that no one bothers asking questions or worries about buffers. Except one day something is slightly off which causes a trigger to fire early, then some other element is thrown off, and without a buffer or rational thought to question nonsense, the system self destructs."

It drives the price down to $0.50, the algos buy again. This oscillation is the wave I talk about or the harmony that /u/ElkExpert7740 talks about. Nobody intends for it, but everyone randomly syncing up starts swinging things more and more.

It's hand wavey as hell, but that's the basic idea. The randomness of it is what would prevent people from taking advantage in real life.

I am referring to the bizzare behaviour of stocks afterfor instance citron research, a flimsy, one person site, making a strange comment and downgrade on a stock on twitter and then in that exact same time the stock crashes over 30%. Without any news.

These things are not natural, they only happen if an earthquake destroys the factory, or the CEO dies in a plane crash...

Then you have the whole shady thing around GME and AMC.

Dark Pool trades of GME are around 50%. And inspite of repeated good news - debt free, new chairman, excellent, team, no debts, the stock just moves down or sideways. 

[https://gme.crazyawesomecompany.com/](https://gme.crazyawesomecompany.com/)

Then there are the high frequency wash sales/short ladder attacks on many companies. The aggressive rumours against companies being shorted etc...

A lot of these things are entirely illegal in Europe or South Korea or Hong Kong markets.

2021-05-20 09:41:37,stocks,"That’s a great question.  I don’t have anything concrete but thank you for making me  think.  In general, while I’ve been a saver and traditionally make entry investments in stonks that suffer a downside event, I’m leaning towards less dependence on placing money w/ Wall Street and more investment in myself, family & others in my community.  For example, I’ve made the conscious effort to avoid “convenience” factor like buying from AMZN and instead shopping at our local stores.  It requires a little more effort & maybe a little more $$ at risk but the payoff is much more rewarding.  In the same way, It’s convenient to put money in an etf, mutual fund or stock.  Yet the result of this is more fraud, deceit and abuse.  One issue is my wife is a financial advisor and while I earned a CFA which helps me speak to subject, she doesn’t see what I see. Perhaps I should stop playing “this game” of measuring my myself by my stock portfolio or bank account.   But for now, I’ve found an investment that has a couple of unique things going for it but what is most profound is it moves (in general) in opposite direction of everything else in my name."

I also think in some respects that it makes capital markets less efficient. Shouldn’t the purpose of capital be to reward innovative companies instead of just rewarding the biggest companies? But people who buy the indexes are not efficiently allocating their capital.

Now, Goldman is like well, I guess that lower price looks tasty and buys back in. Rinse, wash, repeat. 

The amount of capital they control is why the system feels ‘rigged’ and that’s before we even get into all the other things like having all the information in the world at their fingertips, having insiders at various companies, using the media to say one thing while doing another, issuing research reports, analysts opinions, etc. Technically speaking, the market isn’t rigged but if you go to a poker table with $10,000 and are up against a handful of people with $1,000,000,000, well good luck coming out on top."

As far as banks, when you buy a Vanguard index fund (such as VT, which is an ETF, for example) it's a 0,08% yearly management fee and that's it. No banks actually get your money; it's all between you and vanguard (which isn't a bank).

As for efficient capital allocation and price discovery, that's an interesting, ongoing (and probably will be ever going) argument between active vs passive. In the end, both are necessary. Active investors subject themselves to variance while seeking alpha (both the good and bad side of variance) while providing price discovery, and passive investors strengthen the beta and provide stability and steady inflows.

The study tracked emissions upstream. So, when you burn gasoline in your car or natural gas in your house, the oil company that extracted it is considered ""responsible"" for the emissions. Because of this upstream tracing, the entire top 50 (listed on page 14) is coal and oil producers.

What's more, not all entities in the top 100 were corporations. For example, the number 1 spot is held by China's *entire coal industry as a whole*.

Archegos is a good example of a hedge fund that recently imploded due to some highly leveraged trades that went south.

In the context of trading, imagine everyone is super hyped about the new Tesla model. A bunch of newbie investors buy stock ahead of its release. The release comes, and the reception is lukewarm. Some of these newbie investors get nervous and sell their stock. Other newbie investors see this and panic sell.

Suddenly, the price tanks and smarter investors see the long term potential and snatch up cheap stocks. The newbies see the price climbing again and buy back in hoping to make some money up from their panic selling. One of the newbies gets nervous again and cashes out, causing another dip from panic selling, leading to *more* stocks being bought for cheap.

When it's people, there's a lot of ""what ifs"" involved because of human nature and the inherent slowness of not being computers. With a whole bunch of algorithms trading as fast as they can, they may wind up in that cycle where the price keeps careening up and down. Or they might all panic sell and never stop. The algorithms are only as good as the teams writing them.

The market is obviously *way* more complicated, but you could theoretically see that sort of effect as algorithms interact with each other. Theoretically. I'm completely out of my depth here to be honest. I understand the analogies way more than the market."

But I think that pharmaceutical companies don't have nearly as much of an incentive to discover new antibiotics or antivirals . . . when they could be developing antidepressants or anti-hypertensive medication which requires the patient to take a pill every day for basically the rest of their life. 

For example, this one pharmaceutical company discovered a revolutionary new antibiotic that was a versatile tool against resistant strains of bacteria like MRSA and VRE . . . and the CDC basically reviewed their data and said ""Wow, this is a great new drug you got there. But you aren't allowed to put it on the market. Because the bacteria are adapting to every antibiotic we got so far, so we need at least one ace up our sleeve. So if a super-resistant bacterial strain goes around trying to kill everyone, we'll have one weapon that they ain't never seen yet""

The online marketplace for used luxury goods late Monday posted financial results for the first quarter that are not being well received by the Street. The  RealReal  (ticker: REAL) reported revenue for the quarter of  $98.8 million , up 27% from a year earlier and ahead of the Street consensus forecast of  $95.9 million . Gross merchandise volume was  $327 million , also up 27%. On a non-GAAP basis, the company lost  49 cents  a share, in line with the Street consensus.
For the second quarter, the company sees GMV about flat sequentially in the  $320 million  to  $330 million  range, but up 75% to 80% from a year earlier -- an easy comparison given the deep decline in the business during the pandemic last spring. The company did not provide more detailed guidance on the quarter or any outlook for the full year.

Love me a good gap-down recovery play. REAL is trading well under it's previous high after lackluster earnings early last week. Massive volume shelf supporting price between $13 and $15.50. Looking for an entry below $14 for a swing to fill the gap up."

 SANTA CLARA, Calif., May 19, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [AMD](https://www.amd.com/) (NASDAQ: AMD) today announced that its Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program. Under this program, the company intends to repurchase up to $4 billion of outstanding AMD common stock. AMD expects to fund repurchases through cash generated from operations which have been strengthened by the company’s strong operational results.  


“Today’s announcement reflects our confidence in AMD’s business and the successful execution of our multi-year growth strategy,” said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD president and CEO. “Our strong financial results and growing cash generation enable us to invest in the business and begin returning capital to our shareholders.”

Under this program, which is designed to return value to AMD stockholders, offset dilution from stock issuances, and reduce share count over time, the company will repurchase stock in the open market. This repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time."

We also saw expansionary monetary police lead to Japan's lost decade as well as the biggest financial disaster since the Great Depression.  You're picking and choosing your data.

I could be wrong, but if you assert ""QE is definitely proven and tested"", that's simply not accurate.

>Anyway, I feel at this point that you’re pretty set in your ideology having not studied the subject matter too deeply.

My degree is in economics.  I'm not really an economist but I have been studying all of this somewhat deeply for the last few months.  I could be wrong, of course, which is why I'm not asserting anything with certainty.  All I'm saying is that the certainty around these policies is not rooted in fact.

FWIW, I teach English to a top Brazilian economist who is opposed to QE.  BRIC countries in general are opposed to it.

Finally, economist William White spoke out against Greenspan's easy liquidity policy and [predicted the 2008 crash](https://www.spiegel.de/international/business/the-man-nobody-wanted-to-hear-global-banking-economist-warned-of-coming-crisis-a-635051.html).  Nobody wanted to listen to him then, either, because the world was facing an ""unprecedented boom"" of the type you're speaking of.  He writes about the unintended consequences of loose monetary policy [here](https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/institute/wpapers/2012/0126.pdf).

PS: I'm losing my structure a bit here but there's a difference between unconventional monetary policy (QE) and traditional monetary policy / structural reform / fiscal stimulus."

I might be completely off the mark with my idea of the whole thing, but whenever I think of shopify, that's what I think of.

> In a deal that hands a huge victory to shareholders of bankrupt Hertz Global Holdings Inc., the car renter picked Knighthead Capital Management and Certares Management to buy the company out of Chapter 11, capping a dramatic brawl for control of the company.
> 
> The deal, which gives a reorganized Hertz an enterprise value of $7.43 billion, was picked over an offer from a competing group led by Centerbridge Partners, Warburg Pincus and Dundon Capital Partners, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the plan hasn’t been made public. The Knighthead-Certares plan would give equity holders a recovery of about $8 a share -- a package that’s made up of about $240 million in cash and warrants for nearly 20% of the reorganized company, the people said.
> 
> Hertz shares -- which up until two months ago were faced with the prospects of being completely wiped out under an earlier plan -- soared as much as 41% Wednesday to as high as $5.19. That approached a high of $6.25 last June, when traders snapping up penny stocks on the popular Robinhood app sought to defy decades of convention and make money on a bankrupt company.
> 
> Representatives for Knighthead, Certares and Warburg Pincus declined to comment, while Hertz, Dundon and Centerbridge didn’t immediately provide comment.
> 
> 
> Hertz shares soar above $4 on bankruptcy exit plans
> The Knighthead-Certares group’s win brings the pandemic’s biggest Chapter 11 case nearer to a close, with Hertz seeking to exit court protection in June. Judge Mary Walrath must approve the final plan in Delaware bankruptcy court.
> 
> Investment firms have been dueling over ownership of Hertz for weeks, with both groups seeking to top the other with multiple rounds of proposals. An earlier Knighthead proposal valued Hertz’s equity at around $2.25 a share, with an enterprise value of $6.2 billion, Bloomberg previously reported.
> 
> As part of the winning plan, Apollo Global Management has committed $1.5 billion of preferred equity. Investors also would have the option to participate in a $1.6 billion rights offering.
> 
> The competition came amid surging demand for rentals and summer travel that has let many car renters raise prices while still leaving them without enough vehicles for customers to drive off the lot. Rival Avis Budget Group Inc. has seen its shares more than double this year.
> 
> Final proposals from both groups offered lenders and bondholders full repayment along with the share recovery, a relative rarity in bankruptcy proceedings. Hertz initially chose an iteration of the Centerbridge group’s plan, and Walrath last month approved a so-called breakup fee for those funds if they were later outbid.
> 
> Hertz sought bankruptcy protection in May 2020 when the near-total shutdown of the global travel industry sent its rental revenues plunging. Equity holders initially appeared to be wiped out, while junior bondholders were slated to take a haircut. Still, Hertz became a popular stock among day traders, who sent shares rocketing on optimism that they could defy the norms of bankruptcy court and win a payout. The stock frenzy even briefly helped the company fund its bankruptcy by selling new equity.
> 
> The case is Hertz Corp. 20-11218, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington)."

Stocks will also crash as corporations basically can't make any profits. Many corporations will flee as profit margins become so low. Which leads to even smaller supply of products/services sources. 

Taxes to pay back debt will not lead to inflation, taxes to just redistribute wealth just because that individual has a low net worth will lead to insane levels of inflation.

Regardless of where they are at as companies they are popular, highly talked about momentum stocks. The trick is knowing when to sell. I have no loyalty to a stock and once it gets caught up in the hype and exuberance of the market I'm taking profit.

I bought GME at $10 and sold at an average of $200. I believed it was undervalued at $10 and fair value, given the turn around possibilities, was $40-$60 max. Once it ran past that I started to take profits and set stops.

I bought PLTR on DPO day for $9.50 and sold at $27, it's a long term stock and will have a good run but it ran too hot too fast as got way ahead of it's valuation. I bought in again recently. 

I bought RKT at $20 and sold at $34. It had consolidated at $20 for months but still had a lot of chatter about it. Once they accounted a special dividends it skyrocketed and I was out. 

I bought CRSR at $37 and it's at $32 and NIO at $42 and it's at $33 so not all wins but I'm ok holding these two for a longer period of time as I see them having solid futures."

Where is this planned redistribution of wealth announced, I don't see it. The planned tax hike was only a 7% increase for corporations, if they struggle to expand be cause of that, they do not deserve to expand at all. If you are referring to the 39.6% tax, its for the top income tax bracket and  capital gains and even in that case its not even an all time high tax rate, its just going back to pre-trump tax rate.

I think the bigger issue is there’s 100 sites to choose from and the barrier to entry is nonexistent. People aren’t paying for a product or even really a service. They’ll pay for a service that allows them to gamble, but the two are separate ideas. 

You can tell because DKNG is out there dumping your money at my doorstep just so I use them versus bovada or anywhere else. Literally I’ve made more from DKNG than any investor this year just in terms of the 100s they’ve given my account (I don’t count my short positions printing fwiw)

I'm fine with purchasing high priced stocks if I believe they are going higher and $20 is an okay price however, the market could turn at any moment and this is the type of stock that could take a beating in the wrong economic climate.

Can it be cut down to $15 or lower, yes. Can it then rebound to be a $40 stock in a year or two, yes. Can you live with that level of volatility and have the conviction in your thesis, that's up each individual.

If you absolutely must pick your own stocks (not going to judge; I pick my own even though I know I can’t beat the market), learn a few of the fundamental numbers first and choose based on those (e.g. profit margin, revenue growth, EPS), but don’t buy too many shares.

Also, you are paying capital gains on ever transaction right. Your interest paid isn't deductible?"
2021-05-20 15:18:44,stocks,"I'm not really worried about the option price, I collect the premium and then hold the stock for as long as it takes to get called away.  


For example:  


I buy AMD on May 1 at $75  


Sell a CC for $75.5 expiring that friday (let's say May 5)  


If it hits or is above $75.5 then it's called away. I make premium + 50c per share  


If it doesn't hit then I sell the same CC for the next week, same strike price  


If it drops massively (happened to me with Uber) then I have to adjust - sell the same CC for almost no premium until the price goes back up - or take a risk and sell a higher premium but below my entry level CC and hope it doesn't hit.  


  


For taxes I actually have to speak with my accountant on it but I'm assuming it will be capital gains and conservatively take 30% away from all my gains just to be safe.  


For the high IV stocks I look mainly at their premiums and often just google them, but I have  a list of rules for which stocks I pick, a large percentage are ones that I wouldn't mind holding long term and only one or two are the nonsense ones (GME, AMD etc). So it's a mix of a lot of parameters"

It had dropped around 30% in a day due to goverment investigation. I like reading about politics. In the US, most of the time when a company faces govermental scrutiny, it walks away scot free. I thought the same would apply here. I was wrong. They did get fined, and while it not the end of the world, the momentum this company has had in the past 8 months is absolutely attrocious.  
TLDR: Was under the impression that big companies were untouchable by gouverment after seeing it happen many times in the US. I was wrong."

2021-05-20 15:44:50,stocks,"I'm not sure how to judge or answer that. I will say that last year there was a massive shortage of Oatly. I think they were in the middle of switch up some production and distribution processes. But it was very well known and talked about in the vegan community. There were entire threads on Reddit on where to find it and buy it.

Like for example my go-to drink at coffee shops is an oat milk latte, and Oatly is the brand I always want, look for, and compliment the shop on when they have it. That's been true for a few years now. When there was a shortage, I had frequent conversations with baristas and resellers about it and they all mentioned that it was a frequent topic and inquiry.

So yes, I think in certain cases, brand loyalty matters and is difficult to measure. Oatly is one of the old-school vegan brands and really is better than the competition.

I own a vegan trade show, so I'm pretty plugged into the scene. I bought some share and will hold on for a while."

I don't see how they can't go up if they survived covid with profit. Non paying tenants are getting the boot soon. Inflation means your money will grow to match or exceed, because they generally don't make more land. Existing housing scales with material shortages too.

I honestly don't know what to buy right now.

But as interest rates going up means prices go down. Think of it this way. You have X amount of people in the market for a home with the ability to pay Y. These variables don't change with interest rate. So basically you payment per month is gonna be Y. People generally buy the most home they can. So if the payment is fixed and that equals the value * a percent, the only way percent can go up is if value can go down."

If you use lump sums, it's either a good gain with the right timing or a bigger loss compared to dca if your timing is off. Bigger risk, bigger reward. 
And it's not about believing in a stock - if market downturns like yesterday happen (which are not easily foreseeable) they will affect your timing. I would be glad to have some money on the sideline to reduce my cost basis because if I think my first entry point was a good deal then on these days it's an even better opportunity.

And you're not losing money, you're gaining less versus a well-timed lump sum investment.
BUT you're gaining more if it dips and you buy again versus a lump sum investment in the beginning. 

Dont get me wrong: Both approaches are valid and can work very well for different investors. The outcome just heavily depends on the general market movement and timing of the buy-ins."

2021-05-19 23:24:35,stocks,"Stock can vaporize. Much of what people think they own is held on street name, meaning the DTC and corporate IR list your broker as the owner, while you're just an entry in your broker's ledger so they know where to forward proxies and dividends. If those records are corrupted, you may have to have copies of statements to show you still own it.

And if the broker was never trading anything for real, even that may not work.

SIPC will cover $500k, of which 250k may be cash. A sweep account may split your cash to different corporate entities to get each piece covered.

So if you keep more than 500k in eligible securities in one brokerage (not just one account), anything over that may be completely uninsured."

As for vaporizing, sure. There are tons of ways to mitigate it. Just put it in a low cost index fund like VOO or VTI to solve that problem or diversify. In general, once you have a lot of wealth, this is your only realistic option if you goal is to protect long term else inflation decay will be painful. The other realistic option is real estate but $1m doesn't go far and realty requires work.

Honestly all this is overblown. Just hold an index fund and select a major broker. Government will not allow anything to happen to your stock. The only way you can potentially lose it is if there is no more USA. If that happens, your money is toast anyway."

[SIPC protects against the loss of cash and securities – such as stocks and bonds – held by a customer at a financially-troubled SIPC-member brokerage firm. The limit of SIPC protection is $500,000, which includes a $250,000 limit for cash.](https://www.sipc.org/for-investors/what-sipc-protects)

That's it. That's the list.

If you want your $1M insured, don't keep more than $250k cash in any bank or brokerage firm, or $500k total in any brokerage firm.

The SIPC has a couple of twists:  money market accounts (sweep accounts) are considered securities, not cash, so you don't have to buy risky instruments to get all 500k protected; and, they don't protect currency, commodities or commodity futures, or warrants on those, but they do protect options on currencies and warrants to buy those options.

[Some sweep accounts actually divide the money among multiple, separate corporate entities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303948104579534061394822726), so your $1M may automatically be split up and set apart enough to be protected.

2021-05-20 02:19:32,stocks,">I’m just saying, our industry is not really in this “write code that works the first time” mindset. Software isn’t like a bridge, you can’t have some engineer sign off on 1M lines of code and say “this is safe”.

Hence the several years and several million miles of real world testing. This is AI not just ""lines of code"". The ""code"" is just one small part of the overall system, what the AI learned and how the sensors feed it data are just as, if not more, important than the quality of the initial code.

The safety has to be statistically proven, not just ""signed off by an engineer"". It's different for bridges because you don't get to test them for billions of scenarios before you open them. Lastly, before FSD actually goes mainstream, congress will likely shield manufacturers of the vehicles from that liability because of the overwhelming safety benefits, leaving regular insurance to deal with the specifics each accident that may occur"

You have a limited understanding of these systems work. Code is not “just one small part” of it. It is all code. The ML stuff doesn’t just keep learning over millions of miles. The “learning” plateaus after a while and the marginal gains from adding more data to the training set diminish to zero. What they’re doing is actually tweaking the code and retesting.

As I said, it’s almost all code, the ML stuff that is actually trained “over a million miles” just does a very specific task: identify objects around the car and measure distances to the objects. Once you have that information, the rest is hand-written code. There is no reinforcement learning or anything like that for driving the car."

>It is all code

No. It isn't. It starts with code, that code uses data to build a model, that model can be tweaked, the model is then applied, parameters are added to make deterministic decisions in specific scenarios and the entire thing is continously updated using sensors that impact both realtime decisions and future learning models...

The IRS considers a wash sale as if you never actually sold and bought the stock again. The basis and entry date of the new shares are the basis and entry date of the original shares.

You report it anyway, and add the notation on the tax form that it was a wash sale, and exclude the loss due to them (the number of them that you rebought) from your net for the year. When you later sell the new shares, you can backdate them to the entry date of the wash sale shares and use the higher basis. If you're audited, the paper trail is all there."

The whole losses wash sale thing is when you get into the nitty gritty and are considered a ""day trader"" status by the IRS and that a convoluted situation. Its a lot easier to just claim capital gains. because in the end the IRS doesn't care about giving you credits for a .05% loss on one transaction. they just look at it as you buy, sell at at a loss (they dont care) then you buy lower and sell higher, they just look at the gains made on the second transaction. ALSO the only way you can claim losses is if you file as an entity LLC, Corp etc. As a sole prop, you just file basic losses because most people trading and making less than 100K a year from JUST investing capital gains wont incur those kinda of losses. UNLESS you start the year at lets say 100k in your portfolio and end the year at a loss. thats when you claim losses. Nowadays you can submit a full transaction history Excel file to your tax agent and they do all the calculations electronically, so youre not sitting there and analyizing 5,000 Plus transactions which you need to register as a ""day trader.

If you had no wash sales or adjustments, you can summarize and just report your net.

But if the auditor comes knocking, you will want some record that shows right on each sale whether it was a wash sale, or you'll be sweating while going back and forth looking through the 61-day window for them. Much better if it's already part of your filling.

Day traders have to do this, too, *unless* they do mark-to-market reporting, meaning they report their beginning of year assets as basis and end of year assets as proceeds and pay tax on or deduct the net (all of it; no $3k limit on losses).
