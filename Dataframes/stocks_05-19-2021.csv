2021-05-19 18:50:53,stocks,Wall St loves newbie retail investors.
2021-05-19 19:19:05,stocks,They like my money...
2021-05-19 19:27:20,stocks,Money.
2021-05-19 18:54:44,stocks,"Take a look at sector rotation, that’s where the money goes every day.  Also yes, inflation and specifically interest rate increases are very bad for tech stocks and this is due to economics, not ‘what Wall Street likes or doesn’t like’"
2021-05-19 18:49:28,stocks,Wallstreet likes stability. No news is good news sorta thing.
2021-05-19 18:53:52,stocks,"4 words! You are onto something. Just keep learning, diversify, keep learning and diversify in that order ;) and don't let people with an agenda confuse you (especially the mainstream media but also be careful of doomsday predictors). 
Wall Street is not a single entity but rather a very vague term which encompasses a lot of different financial services kinds: funds, banks, brokers, custodians etc. 
Many funds itself have different investment strategies and time horizons so don't get too dragged on what someone in the media says."
2021-05-19 19:26:53,stocks,wall street loves money and the easier the better.
2021-05-19 19:25:46,stocks,They like that they they can commit hundreds of felony offenses and get off Scott free.
2021-05-19 19:01:53,stocks,They like a slow consistent moon like trajectory. All news is bad news.
2021-05-19 19:25:29,stocks,Wall Street likes momentum.
2021-05-19 19:00:10,stocks,Oil buy CVX
2021-05-19 18:55:07,stocks,Oh that's something I had to learn the hard way lol
2021-05-19 18:57:23,stocks,Is that due to tech stocks more likely to be operating in debt?
2021-05-19 19:05:27,stocks,"It's more because their stock prices are based on earnings in the distant future, and if you discount those earnings at a higher interest rate over many years you end up with a much lower valuation today."
2021-05-19 18:59:58,stocks,"Yeah like tesla, they basically don’t make any money still.  High interest rates would make borrowing money harder for Tesla, and Tesla needs money.  Wall Street doesn’t care though cause Wall Street wants money too, so they stop investing in Tesla because Tesla is going to basically go into more debt if rates increase.  I could be wrong a little bit that’s the gist of it regarding tech stocks & rates"
2021-05-19 19:08:33,stocks,So the higher interest rates cut into their future earnings which is what their value is based on? As opposed to companies like say coke which is being traded on its current value and isn't expected to randomly skyrocket earnings somewhere down the line
2021-05-19 19:10:17,stocks,Makes perfect sense. Now I kind of want to get out of tech entirely. Seems silly to base your entire value on a company which could completely change if something outside their control (interest rates) change
2021-05-19 18:28:21,stocks,"Boiler Room- with a young Vin Diesel and Ben Affleck

2021-05-19 18:36:13,stocks,Wolf of wall street is not a finance movie. It’s scam movie
2021-05-19 19:12:58,stocks,"Margin Call, Margin Call, Margin Call.

Jeremy Irons was magnificent in his role.

I remember my finance professor recommended the movie when it came out… accurate look at ‘08 crisis from a bank POV."
2021-05-19 18:46:02,stocks,"Not in the top 5, but I enjoyed the enron: smartest guys in the room documentary. 

If your looking for 3 I would say the original wall street would fit the void. Margin call and boiler room are close behind. 


Not wall street or finance,  but for Sales: Glengarry Glenn Ross is always enjoyable too."
2021-05-19 18:26:17,stocks,3. Margin call
2021-05-19 18:33:00,stocks,Boiler Room (2000)? Wallstreet (1987)?

2021-05-19 18:56:30,stocks,"Fidelity has OCO (one cancels the other) orders. You place the limit order and the stop loss order simultaneously. When one fills, the other is cancelled."
2021-05-19 17:57:22,stocks,"Unless you have an advisor that’s managing your money for you and could automatically set the limit sells for you per your requirements, you’d probably just have to keep an eye on the price and set the limits yourself as it crosses certain price targets."
2021-05-19 18:34:57,stocks,Look at limit orders that use a trigger. This is all brokerage dependent so your best option is to talk with whomever you are with.
2021-05-19 18:48:39,stocks,Stop limit order if your brokerage has it
2021-05-19 18:05:29,stocks,"But if it hits $200, I want it to trigger a market sell. Will this happen if it crossed that number? I want it so that if the price per share hits, say, $199 at least I’ll be able to cash out at $150 on the way down from $199."
2021-05-19 18:49:19,stocks,This
2021-05-19 19:06:41,stocks,Would it be a stop limit sell?
2021-05-19 18:32:03,stocks,"That's a horrible idea. You don't want a market sell. If there's a flash crash you could end up selling for far lower than you want, only to have the stock immediately recover."
2021-05-19 18:30:24,stocks,"If it hits 200, your limit sell will trigger because that's a separate order you've placed. If also have a -50 trailing stop and the price hits a peak of 199 and then drops to 149 your trailing stop will execute"
2021-05-19 19:22:02,stocks,If it hits $199 then press sell. Google bracket orders for more information.

2021-05-19 18:03:38,stocks,">Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting. Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, inducing fear and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines). This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.

Its closing below your trend line, but still closed above the 200 MA, and still has two strong support levels to blow through before going sub 100 (120 and 110) - What negative catalysts do you anticipate that send this down another 25%, through major support, and then the past even the psychological support which will happen at 100. Its just as likely we bounce off 120 and head back up as we do head down. We'll need an outside catalyst to decide which way this goes, and given the negative market we could get one, but again we still have two support levels to get through before your price target, I just don't see it. Instead of negative earnings or bad fundamentals, we could get good earnings and positive fundamentals. Like...Apple has sooo much cash on hand, AR/VR coming, apple car coming, their processor is crushing it, and on and on."

The reference is that if the stock is trading at the right price only after researching the business and comparing the current price to the intrinsic value. If the value is less than the price,  it would NOT be a gamble. A company can be close to bankruptcy and be trading less then liquidation value.  Could be a bad ""stock"" but a favorable or ""good stock price."" You could also have another company that is a great performer, but you can buy it at the high and paying a premium well above is intrinsic value before an unforseen future event or economical downturn and the risk could be high because it was not a ""good stock price.

2021-05-19 19:59:24,stocks,"Your premise isn't necessarily correct.   Earnings do still matter, but maybe not in the way you expect them to.  

My professor for financial economics had us read ""A Random Walk Down Wallstreet"".  There is a lot in the book, but I took out of it something that has seemed to be fairly close to a certainty over the last 20ish years. Actually two truths if you will. 

In an oversimplified way of thinking, there are two types of investors in the stock market.   The are fundamentalists and technicians.

Fundamentalist are more akin to a Warren Buffet.  Invest in things that make sense, with profits you can see.  To these guys earnings are very important.  They are trying to invest in the long term profitability of the company.  What the price does today, or over the next week, or even next year doesn't matter.   If people are buying coke and coke isn't submerged under debt and coke has good leadership, invest in coke.

Technicians have some type of technique they are trying to use to invest.   The most common are ""chartest"" where they look at the price chart for some  pattern that they think repeats throughout the  market, across time and securities.   Think of all the people pointing to charts claiming the big squeeze on GME.

Now the first truth I've learned is that fundamentalist are usually right in the long term.  Healthy, profitable companies don't go out of business.  But in the short term, fundamentals don't matter. Technicians may or may not be right, but if enough people start believing the same thing, then it comes true.  

Here lies the second truth.  The stock market, really all markets, work day to day on Christmas Magic.  If enough people (or bots or institutions or pension funds or whatever) just believe that Santa Clause is real,  that jolly fat ass will come down your chimney.  It's all belief.  Christmas magic won't make Sears become Walmart.   It won't resurrect Toys R Us.  But it can, for one day, make the impossible possible."

2021-05-19 17:33:01,stocks,"Value investor here, not financial advice, just my thoughts:

Earnings don't matter. Price-per-unit of current and discounted future earnings matters.

Checking yahoo finance, LOW has a forward PE of about 20... reasonable, not amazing, but it has a PEG of 1.44, which is not very good at all.

What does this mean? It means that the future growth of the company is slowing down. So while the Price-per-unit of earnings (PE), is reasonable, the projected PE to Earnings Growth (PEG), that is, the relative price per unit of projected earnings is high. So, some might say is likely that *future* earnings will be worth less than earnings today... which means the stock might not be a good idea to buy right now. 

I'm sorry that might be hard to follow, finance is hard."

2021-05-19 15:04:17,stocks,"It's called ""buy the rumor, sell the news""; helped by insider trading.

Home improvement stocks have been rising for a while. Week after week of bull run up to the earnings. This happened because people were expecting them to smash earnings. So when the news came that they did, profits were taken because in place of high expectations, there's no further momentum.

The hedge funds & institutional investors know that - they realize that reporting earnings is like blowing your load, all that excitement gets released & then the stock goes flat because people don't have anything to look forward to until the next earnings. This is why there's always a run up before earnings - or a run down when the expectation is the other way. It's about momentum.

But the trick is, *because they know a profit taking is coming*, they're going to try and get out before other investors do. Buy low, sell high, right? That's what everyone's trying to do. Yet because everyone's trying to do it, it becomes a classic game theory problem. If you sell at the top first, you win. If the other guy sells at the top first, he wins. But if you sell too early, you lose. Same goes for him. So how do you ensure you sell first but not too early? Answer is - well, the answer is complicated because it involves all sorts of advanced mathematics involving Nash equilibrium equations, minimum-maximum optimization, etc. 

But at the end of the day, how it appears to your random retail trader who's got a college degree at best is that it seems totally random, or that it's all manipulated.

That's only because you don't know the rules of the game. You can't see the mechanics. Sufficiently advanced technology looks like magic. Sufficiently advanced trading looks like bull ****."

Right now its 25ish and we all know that the sales boost was due to covid stimulus and is not sustainable. Long term it will be fine but its not like you are getting it cheap right now.

As for pure speculative stocks, you cannot apply any fundamentals to them. They follow emotional sentiment and day traders own them during trading hours and they just follow whatever trend presents itself."
2021-05-19 15:13:55,stocks,"I hear this all the time but I have also seen this twice already in my lifetime and I am sure it has happened before. Like everything though with social media and media in general coverage of everything is making everyone more aware.

Leading up to Dotcom and housing bubbles I had many friends investing all over the map some won and some lost.

I lost on the dotcom and learned - value and somewhat growth invested after that and did not really even feel the housing bubble (income sure did! but not investments). Took the downturn as a chance to double down on many stocks I already owned for years.

Honestly plan on doing the same again with the next bubble - did it last year with a small amount during March/Covid - still holding some CCL and DAL.

As other have said long term investment/planning - these short term moves may not make since all the time (mainly I believe because we do not look far enough out)

Specifically to Lowes - Lumber appears it might be hitting a bubble (futures off 27% from highs); housing starts are way off due to high costs; Inflation concerns might lead to an interest rate hike - all of which leads to less spending on building materials going forward. SO while they had a good report the future is looking pretty sketchy.

ALSO keep in mind a lot of HD/Lowes spending is from people stuck at home last year. The money that was spent last year on renovations will be moved back to paying for travel and many are expecting it to be a big swing to travel to the point of taking the renovation businesses to a point lower than pre-pandemic.

As for the other companies you listed - sorry none of them would even be on my radar to invest in - call me to conservative - just too many good solid companies (long term) to look at.

Bottom line a lot of factors always at play AND most are not obvious or even revealed until it is too late for some investors."

2021-05-19 15:23:23,stocks,"Concerning Lianlou Smart: The company completed a merger in which they bought Newegg. So that might be big news to drive the price up.

Concerning Lowes: A lot of time, investors will take profit on good news, and the price will come down temporarily. Also, the earnings (backwards looking) might mean a lot less than future guidance. The price of Loews has run up from 66 to 188 since the height of the pandemic. Sure enough, guidance from the CEO has made many investors question whether such strong sales trends can continue for Lowes as we exit the pandemic and labor costs increase.

I don't know why the other stocks have made runs, but there might be an answer. The answer might have to do with something technical, or a broader segment trend. At any rate, despite what people tell you, the market is not based on fundamentals. Fundamentals are a part of the equation, but if every stock was fairly priced all the time, there would never be any big gainers or losers. Think of it this way: There aren't enough analysts on earth to price every equity fairly based on fundamentals. They simply don't know. That's why all of the ""tech"" stocks get put into one basket and traded together, even though all of the tech stocks are different. Biopharmas are a great example - there's no reason for them to trade together in a trend, but they often do."
2021-05-19 17:17:16,stocks,"First of all - the whole market DOES matter. LOW is only down 70bps more than the S&P today - which is well within the range it trades in a given day... The second huge piece that you're missing is that you're looking at LOW in isolation of today's earnings. Yes - earnings were higher than expected, but the stock market is speculating on the FUTURE earnings potential of a business. LOW was a HUGE Covid beneficiary (as was home depot) and there are serious questions about how much longer the boom in home improvement is going to last. Especially in a questionable rates and inflation environment. Also while sales gained, the PACE of sales gains slowed for the 3rd quarter which is a signal to the market. A large part of that growth this quarter also came from stimmy checks, which there is uncertainty about going forward.  
  
Not to say you shouldn't be skeptical.... but there's ALWAYS a reason for the most part. Especially in heavily trafficked companies like LOW - can't speak for smaller cap stuff.  
  
Advaxis is sketchy AF because there was no news - traded 190mm shares and then they released clinical data in a PR at 5pm... someone knew something.

2021-05-19 15:36:30,stocks,"""Buy the rumor, sell the news"" is not pump and dump.

Many new investors simply don't even know what valuations are, since they've been fed growth and hype since they started investing. 

A company can kill earnings and still be overvalued, a company can double earnings and still be overvalued  – just because a company is worth 100USD today doesn't mean it's worth 200USD tomorrow if it doubles its business.

It's brutally simple. The market is forward looking and unless something comes in like a curveball out of the blue; it's also pretty efficient  most of the time. That earnings beat has been priced in months ago. That new product has been priced in months ago. That sector rotation was priced in months ago. Once those new financials are confirmed, the smart money has already moved on, the people who gambled to squeeze the last few dollars are dumping, and only the people who never bother to look at other numbers than share price are holding the bag – only to sell low later and the cycle begins anew.

You can absolutely make good deals, but you do it when companies are out of favour and cheap, or, you buy the rumor and sell before the news. Other than that, longterm investing in solid companies and holding through ups and downs is the only way to go."

*dropping*

Weeding out paperhanded bitches who have so much money they never have to actually step foot in a Lowes store to find out for themselves how much better in every way they are than Home Depot. It's really not hard to figure out, did you even check the short interest?

If stocks with $150B market caps are able to be manipulated like you think that is a problem with WAAAAAAY too many speculators vs actual investors. THAT is what you need to be concerned with, and that's an issue with the overall market right now, not any one particular ticker. I get the rant, but earnings plays are really low hanging fruit that any simp can do if they have about 45 minutes to listen to some overpaid prick talk on a shitty VOIP.

Do your own DD, which it seems like you did, and knew well enough to not step on a landmine setting itself up for a juicy short. So what if it some bullshit pharma company went up today? What if it goes down even harder tomorrow? Wouldn't you look silly ranting about things that go up on speculation today, and down for the same reason tomorrow?

If you don't understand casino market dynamics, the best bet is to not play. Of course isn't a casino, and anyone who tells you that is either a butthurt moron who buys mutual funds, or a liar trying to hustle you. Wall Street right now is a digital ghetto where hedge fund crackheads are chasing every gain they can because the free money supply is gone, they bought too much crack too high and sold it too low, and their dealer wants his money. Bubble crack is what happens when powder goes up, and they want that magic gain powder more than Bubba wants to suck gasoline out of a dry Colonial pipeline so his truck nutz go brrr. If they can step on some and sling it back for a few bucks, they'll do it with theta crew. Game theory, all the way down. Did you see what happened to AAPL right before it's stellar Q1 report? 10% down in power hour. Apple, the company that always goes up! Why? Why didn't it go 10% up? Because someone got called on GME...

Do you believe in the stock? Is it at a good price? Then buy it and forget about it! If it goes down buy more! It's full-court press hustle mode right now to get as much money out of retail as possible while throwing shade at nervous investors to make them flinch. Just like you said, earnings don't matter and that's the short term market outlook this year. Too much money fueling too much speculation. 2021 has a lot of smoldering embers after the brushfire of last year with massive amounts of money entering and moving toward gains gaining more gains. Lots of solid long term investment material is buried under massive short interest that couldn't be taken care of because the GME nuclear bomb got armed. If you are on the wrong side of that deal it's full-court press mode to rustle up enough cash to survive getting called. If you are smart enough to search out heavily shorted tickers with great DD and want to sit on them as investments, you'd be pretty damn smart right about now. I got a gold mine I've been watching with 1700% short interest that's gonna be melting ingots in Q4 and has 25% more gold than they originally thought, giving them a 10 year supply. And someone just wrote calls!

The market is massively overleveraged, every boring investment ticker is overpriced, and money isn't coming in because investors simply don't have any more money they can squeeze from the labor force, or are getting ready to buy the dip by riding the bond rocket. Bonds are going crazy, more than justified by the rate increase or speculation on further increases; same dynamics at play. Where is more money going to come from for stocks? Main Street is in the shitter and folks don't have money to support realistic P/E ratio gains as it is! Meanwhile those stocks are already massively overpriced anyway because of hedge funds hustling each other and stealing from low-info paperhanded retailers to keep pumping overvalued reserve holdings to justify getting more and more leverage to keep hustling smaller gains. It's a positive feedback cycle that can only end when something breaks down.

The crack game here worked until retail bought all the crack on a block and put it in the paper. Now the cops are discussing watching the streets, the powder supply got tightened, and hustlers suddenly can't afford to sling anymore. What happens when crackheads can't get their crack? They rob and steal whatever isn't nailed down to pay for crack. And if they can't pay the crack broker back for what they already sold or smoked? Someone gets a bullet to the face. Don't be the guy catching the bullet. When you hear the music stop, find the nearest chair and bludgeon anyone trying to take it from you.

It makes no financial sense. You have top chip, tech and pharma companies killing sales yet falling while energy is going up while we are trying to kill the oil and natural gas market. Makes no sense. There is a worldwide chip shortage affecting almost every business in some fashion and chip makers are falling. They have such a chip shortage, companies are adding in 7-10 billion dollar add ons for more output and they still are sliding. Chip makers have more business than they can handle over the next 2 years. Green energy was booming and now it’s tanking. We are moving to green energy yet they are dropping every week. EV is the future and they have struggled to gain traction. It makes no financial sense. 
Here is my 2 cents on it and I’ve said it for a year. You have trillions going into alt investments  while also stale money is stuck in meme stocks to prove a point to suits. You can’t mention the alt investments or mods remove your comment. This is money that would be flowing through the market that isn’t any longer.

In Lowe's case, you can argue that its blockbuster earning has already been priced into the stock. After all, it has gone up 25% steadily in the last 6 months. The largest and most successful companies all have this issue.  Apple, Amazon, all reported crazy record profits, but on the day of ER, stock dipped. Mostly because people actually already priced those expectations in and are now in a profit taking mode.

Google is the one biggest outlier in this sense, but I think that's because people didn't really expect Google to continue to make that much money at that pace given all the competitions surrounding it."

Just look at how much its gone up since Q1 of 2020.  At the same time, in Q2 2020 you might've bene posting the opposite - about how Lowe's keeps rising and yet most of the country is closed and unemployment is too damn high.

Since the ability to short the market is a thing and the ability to make money doing so makes it nearly impossible for retail traders to make money, especially if the shorters are billion dollar hedge funds. Think about it, if no one could short the market and profit for it, then markets would only go up and up with maybe minimal pull backs since the only position one could take would be long.The fact an institution can sell a stock and make profits by doing so makes bear markets longer and more catastrophic.

When hedge fund short a stock it not only creates selling pressure, it also reduce the buying pressure because they switch side. When you have create a sentiment for selling supported by volume, it accelerates. Most of the volume in the market is from bot trading. If the market is selling, your stocks may also trigger the sell button. When you see these small pump after couple red days and think it is finally over, it is merely the short seller covering.

Look into valuation multiples (Not P/E, more sophisticated ones that are less susceptible to 'game' - like EV/Rev., EV/EBITDA.. will be sector specific) & see how a company trades relative to true comps leading into earnings. So even if ones down, its compset could theoretically be more down -- this will give you an idea of how much is 'priced in' or also indicate relative over/under bought levels. 

At the end of the day the trickiest part to playing events is mainly in determining how many buyers of a specific sector has all their buying power already devoted to a stock in anticipation of earnings/events. For example, if everyone thinks earnings will be good and all investors buy in anticipation of it even with good earnings, a stock could drop bc who else is left to buy? Target/Lows/HD is a great example of this - Target's EV/Rev relative to its compset traded at a Z-score to them of <0.4 leading into earnings"

2021-05-19 18:56:34,stocks,"I had noticed this too back when the overall market was pumping. Someone tried to say that even if earnings exceeded expectations, that they didn't exceed them enough. The price drops are usually attributed to retail investors but I've come to believe now that most major price movement is caused by the institutions."
2021-05-19 18:56:51,stocks,"By the rumor (potential good earnings). Sell the news (sell the day of or before earnings)

The way the market has been working is that these good earnings are already in the stock price prior to the release."

Since the institutions have such large positions, they need to incrementally close out their positions. Retail traders think “ok, I’ll buy the dip”... guess who’s on the other side closing out their long positions... institutions. It’s now dipping beyond “the dip” and now there is fear in the market where the retail trader thinks the market is “crashing” and the retail trader starts closing their long positions that they’ve already lost money on and other retail traders start getting short etc... guess who’s on the other side reloading up on their long positions... institutions. It’s the same patter over and over again. The same can be said on the flip side where a price increases after bad news or no news. Institutions move the market, not news... they cause emotions like greed and fear for the retail trader based on how they want to position themselves. there’s always a buyer to a seller, and a seller to a buyer. it’s called market manipulation and it’s cause by entities with billions of dollars moving the market based on uneducated and emotional traders such as myself 😂"

Inflation has already started hitting specific items by percentages in the 100’s like lumber at 300%. In the not to distant future it will have spread to all consumer  goods. On top of that we’re going to see foreclosures out the ass and renters evicted when moratoriums run out, they cant continue them and ruin the property owners and utility companies. We’re fckd"

2021-05-19 19:08:03,stocks,"This is incredibly misguided. You don't truly believe companies will significantly outperform expectations without the stock following, do you?

Who is waiting until they release great earnings to buy the stock? Dumb money! Smart money bought in weeks/months back, and are locking in their profit here. Expectations were great/blowout earnings, when the market delivers, its no surprise to anyone except the rube who sees the headline and decides today would be the perfect day to start a position. Algos/humans will buy large positions on the way up, and sell 50% on the way down, buy back the 50% at the lower half of the range/trend.

As for small caps/micro caps moving like they do.....Crazy shit. I try and stay away from those kind of companies, the floats are so small, and the price is so low, that retail traders/whales can move the stocks quite easily. Just me 0.02

I'd also be curious to how you believe markets should move, they're open 5 days a week just under 8 hours a day, they have to trade, 'fair value' is the real bullshit, if the price traded a few shares a day, sure. All these tickers trade millions and millions a day, and human psychology is shown in the charts, fear, greed, whatever else you can think of. Its not bullshit, its the way its always been, and the way it'll always be\~"

This would be basically my eli5. 

In reality those algos work with millions of parameters that constantly change since they ""learn"" how to optimize these and we end up with a clusterfuck of strange pricemovements.

Labor is the problem and companies playing it safe. When it comes to building, rapid growth has cost many companies dearly in the past. 

What you dont want to do is hire a ton of people then get stuck with not enough work once things correct. Also this isnt the kind of field where you hire someone and they are instantly productive. There is a lot of training involved so again, better to grow slowly than rapidly.

The backlog on materials is just that. A temporary backlog due to a year of low to no productivity. It will correct by year end. Also futures on materials are not reflective of the spot market. They might be predictive of a trend but thats all. Recall when oil went negative... that was fun and funny but obviously not reflective of the actual market. Remember when beef went way up a couple of years ago? It didnt really reflect in the store prices and now we are back to old prices (at least we are here)."

This means that a lot of equity movement is driven by options activity as market makers hedge their positions. This also means that near the end of the day - and especially the week - these hedges unwind and resolve as a response to they day's activity. The popularity of options give so much more leverage to market participants, hence higher intraday volatility as well.

That's why the flurry of activities in the first and last hour of the market has bigger swings in recent times. Not only are those hours most active for equity traders, market hours are the only times most options can be traded.

I realize it could crash at any moment, since its based upon SLV going up (its a covered call ETN) but I've been following both SLV and SLVO, and they feel manipulated. Also, they feel like they converge to each other. For example, SLVO always dips after dividend is paid, but then it always dips a little more, than rises, so if you buy in the middle of the dividend period you will always see a rise in price. And... SLV seems to adjust to that rhythm. I'm under the impression it shouldn't do that, but since I'm new to investing, I'm just watching and learning.

Retail has grown insanely, and obviously an individual retail trader working with only $1400 isn't gonna move markets, but when you multiply that, a fuck ton of them with $1400 can sure give the large funds more to work with in what they do. 

This has always been happening, but it certainly is happening more and at larger degrees now which without a doubt can be attributed to the growth of small money traders.

Double digit dividends are generally a major red flag for a trash stock, a scam, or both"
2021-05-19 16:33:48,stocks,"Should have some sort of chart tool in your brokerage account to look at the price of the dividend payments. If you look far into the past you can see how the company reacted to recessions. If you see, that they didn't give the slightest shit that their stock price fell to the bottom of the recession and still paid out the same dividend five years ago, and then later you see it slightly rise, then that is a consistent dividend. 3-4% should be fine. If you see the dividend raise over time slowly, that means the % of gains you make on whatever you invested in will increase later also.

Perhaps when your stock collapses, as everyone sells off in a panic that armeggedon is near, you will remember the dividend stays consistent and reinvest where you will make a higher percentage yearly yield. If for no reason other than a stock market collapse, your company hasn't reported any significant losses, it collapses along with it, you wouldn't give the slightest fuck while everyone runs out of the building from an airstrike."

2021-05-19 17:09:01,stocks,"You are the person in 2006 that thought the housing market couldn't crash. 

No one knows where GME price will go, but they are using the psychological tool called anchoring to raise expectations. In January, the target was 420.69. It has steadily been raising as more manipulation has occurred up to 10million as the floor now. 

There is evidence to support that it is still heavily shorted (most likely naked shorted). Easiest verifiable info is look at institutional ownership that is over 100%, which isn't possible without a large number of shorts. 

You can put your head in the sand and think the game isn't rigged, or you can join the group and buy a few shares. For some good information, listen to the recent interview with a lawyer that has been trying these types of cases for 20 years.

Edit: I'm not saying that GME will go to 10m. I'm saying that is what they are anchoring right now. I'm in it for the ride. I got in early and I'll sell a portion when I think it has actually squeezed."

Also that’s where all the emails that say “you can earn fr** stock by referring a friend” linked to, so it was implied that that link was to earn more chances. Not to redeem already earned chances.

Because they didn't know why my first two attempts at a deposit failed and neither did I the clearinghouse hit me with a $30 fine. But I was able to reach out rather easily by phone and text to resolve the issues. Got all four different companies as well. I'm still stuck in the hood due to FOMO on possible price movements during the transition. I've heard that it can be a large headache. It's my intention to sell when appropriate and just buy back in.

Is it *only* because Coronavirus came along and required bailouts and we were upset that they should have tucked the money away in their mattress instead of share buybacks?  Obviously that is upsetting and all, but I thought there was more to the explicit deploring of share buyback programs in and of themselves."
2021-05-19 14:57:49,stocks,Ofcourse it is not that much compared to the total float however with this buyback the management signals to the market they believe that the company is undervalued thus bullish news

I can't tell exactly whether you're talking about SPY's share price or the price of the contract in a few places, the lack of expiration dates doesn't give me direction to figure that out, and there's just words and punctuation missing or misplaced that make it really hard to read.

A gross oversimplification is that call option prices go up when the underlying goes up and put option prices go up when the underlying goes down. But that's ignoring theta, or time, decay as the option's expiration date gets closer and closer.

If I follow you correctly, it's impossible to answer because no one can predict the future with certainty. The very best moves you can make are buying calls at the bottom of a decline and riding it up and buying puts at the top of a rise and riding it down. But no one knows when that's going to be."

Yes they have fallen back to IPO but that is still insanely overpriced since at least half will likely fail. These would be all your eV and eV related stuff, specialty apps/sites, lipstick on a pig ""tech"" services with misleading labels like AI or big data service or ""fintech"" (lol), and a bunch of others who claim to be tech but arent really.

All in all, the tech sector, due to its success the last 20 years, has attracted a bunch of imbecile wannabes with their heads up their rears and fraudsters who constantly lie and cheat and they have indeed fooled investors especially the young (sadly). So yea, ""tech"" is over priced right now if you look at averages sector wide. 

And because the sector is hot, they pushed good companies to overpriced territory too including Apple, MSFT, GOOG, Oracle, etc. I might make an exception for AMZN and we can also say that MSFT is fair due to safety but for the most part. We can also say stuff like NFLX, FB, QCOM, CSCO and a few others are probably fair priced.

I wouldnt totally avoid tech but I would stick to safety and just be aware that if the sector crashes when the loser startups start to fail, they will take the sector with them at least temporarily."

That way if market dips you can roll profits into your stocks at much lower levels. If market goes up your Puts expire worthless months from now and you made money either way.If your not into options just buy in 1/3rds.

In general, you have to be careful about purchasing stocks with inflated P/E ratios, especially if they’re trading above a stock’s traditional P/E range. You can use a site like macrotrends to check this.

Even if a company is growing at an exceptional rate, you still need to look over their financial statements and attempt to identify the intrinsic fair value of the company today. There are a variety of methods you can employ to do this, with some being more involved than others.

In general, tech is still overvalued imo. However, my conviction and the degree depends entirely on the specific stock. If you could share a couple of the tickers you were looking for, maybe you can receive more focused advice."

2021-05-19 12:41:20,stocks,"It has a forward P/E of about 23, which is a bit expensive but not unreasonable. Given the actual interest rates and inflation, the current AAPL price is more than reasonable. I wouldn't say it's a great deal, but it's alright. $75-$100 is a bit of a stretch for me if interest rates stay the same. 

Now if inflation isn't temporary and stays high even after summer, interest rates might rise, and depending on how much rates go up over time, $100 AAPL might not be unthinkable. Problem is no one knows what will happen with inflation and interest rates in the near term."

What you’re advocating for is trying to time the market.

At the end of 2015, we were 7 years into a huge bull run with the S&P having more than doubled since 2008.  AMZN was trading around $600.  

Would it have been foolish to buy AMZN in Dec 2015 at its ATH?  No, because it was a good business with great growth prospects. Waiting for a substantial drop would have been foolish and could have cost gains of over 500%."

Growth and tech are probably not though.    
    
Re your original question, PE are around 30-40.    
Tech seems to grow around 20% a year though generally and it's why we seem to be accepting these PE or forward PE levels...    
How long that's sustainable is anyone's guess.    
The likes of Amazon is being given price tags of 5,000 and 6,000 for a years time.         
But it's also growing around 40% I believe.    
    
I honestly feel tech and growth will suffer with yields rising and bonds rotation. So big dips and probably big gap ups.    
They could rise or fall, I just feel they will be most impacted by market movements at any one time.     
    
The likes of Amazon and apple have cash in the bank, so in theory as far as I'm concerned they shouldn't be impacted by rising interest rates. But it doesn't seem to matter from a market perspective. I assume that their growth will slow due to customers not having as much to spend or expansion will slow and things stagnate..."

Yes there is always speculation and demand shift etc., but if you want to objectively say if a stock is overpriced or not to a degree, you can discount future earning forecasts to present day and make an educated guess if it is over priced or not.

If you discount the forecasted earnings for the big tech, I'd say they are not cheap but they are not hugely over priced either. In the last quarter they all blew away the expectations and there is no reason I personally believe they can't do it again."

2021-05-19 15:33:39,stocks,Well their P/S is also one of the highest since 2007 meaning the stock price is going up much faster than their revenue. Again take it as you will but the market in general is still very expensive historically and Apple is one of the stocks that caused it amongst thousands of others. I think this is also the reason why it didn't go up despite blowout earnings. People realized its not a cheap stock anymore.

Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by excluding non-routine items and certain non-cash expenses in the manner described in Attachment 6
Commenting on the annual results, Michael Haack, President and CEO, said, “Across all measures, fiscal 2021 was extraordinary for Eagle as we met and overcame challenges that were inconceivable just a year earlier. The resilience of our business model, our financial discipline and our team’s operational and strategic execution allowed us to deliver record financial results, integrate the largest acquisition in the Company’s history and further streamline our business portfolio by divesting several non-core businesses, all while achieving industry leading safety performance. Our strong operating cash flow enabled us to reduce leverage to under 1.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA, providing us with significant liquidity and increased financial flexibility.”

Mr. Haack continued, “As we begin our new fiscal year, Eagle is well-positioned, both geographically and financially, with ample raw material reserves to capitalize on the underlying demand fundamentals that are expected to support steady and sustainable construction activity growth over the near and long-term. We remain confident in Eagle’s prospects for continued growth and sustainable value creation for all shareholders.”

Mr. Haack concluded, “I want to thank our dedicated employees for their exceptional efforts and focus during this unprecedented time. We have a long history of managing through challenging market conditions, and we have once again shown the benefits of our business model as we navigated through this unpredictable year.”

Decision to Remain a Combined Company

Eagle’s Board of Directors has decided not to pursue the proposed separation of Eagle Materials into two independent, publicly traded companies at this time. Much has transpired since the announcement of the proposed separation that has caused the Board to reevaluate the separation’s merits:

First, the size and financial strength of the combined Company, with its diversified asset base and geographical footprint and its robust balance sheet, have provided great comfort, stability and value to our shareholders, employees, customers and suppliers during an unprecedented and uncertain time.
Second, given the continued consolidation of the industries in which we participate and the Company’s rigorous examination of a number of strategic alternatives since the announcement of the proposed separation, it has become clear that a combined company with greater financial scale and flexibility will be better positioned to pursue key strategic growth options and enhance shareholder value.
Third, since the announcement of the proposed separation, the Company has streamlined its business portfolio including the divestiture of its Oil and Gas Proppants business and other non-core assets.
Mike Nicolais, Chairman of the Board, commented, “Eagle is exceedingly well-positioned and is performing as well as at any time in its history. Both major business segments continue to post industry leading results on just about every measure. As a shareholder, I could not be more pleased with the position of the combined Company. While the Board will continue to evaluate the merits of a separation on a periodic basis, it has concluded, in consultation with external advisors, that the combined Company is in the best position to create long-term shareholder value.”

Capital Allocation Priorities

Eagle remains dedicated to a disciplined capital allocation process to enhance shareholder value. Consistent with our track record, our allocation priorities remain unchanged: 1. Growth investments that meet our strict financial return standards and are consistent with our strategic focus; 2. Operating capital investments to maintain and strengthen our low-cost producer positions; 3. Return excess cash to shareholders, primarily through our share repurchase program.

In the past three years, we have invested nearly $700 million in acquisitions, $303 million in organic capital expenditures and $626 million in share repurchases and dividends. At March 31, 2021, nearly 7.3 million shares remain under the current repurchase authorization.

Reinstatement and Increase of Quarterly Cash Dividend

Eagle’s Board of Directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share, payable on July 16, 2021, to stockholders of record of its Common Stock at the close of business on June 18, 2021. The reinstated quarterly dividend represents a 150% increase from the quarterly dividend in place prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mike Nicolais commented, “The reinstatement of our quarterly dividend reflects Eagle’s strong operational and financial performance, our confidence in the resilience of the business, and our commitment to reward shareholders, while preserving the financial flexibility to continue to grow Eagle and create long-term shareholder value.”

Financial Results

Heavy Materials: Cement, Concrete and Aggregates

Fiscal 2021 revenue in the Heavy Materials sector, which includes Cement, Concrete and Aggregates, as well as Joint Venture and intersegment Cement revenue, was $1.1 billion, a 19% improvement. Heavy Materials annual operating earnings increased 27% to $253.0 million primarily because of improved Cement net sales prices and earnings from the recently acquired Kosmos Cement Business.

Fiscal 2021 Cement revenue, including Joint Venture and intersegment revenue, was up 26% to $944.6 million, and Cement operating earnings increased 29% to $234.0 million. The annual revenue and earnings improvements reflect higher sales volume and net sales prices as well as the significant contribution of the recently acquired Kosmos Cement Business, which added approximately $176 million of revenue and $34 million of operating earnings during the year.

The average annual net Cement sales price for the year increased 1% to $111.19 per ton. Organic (not including the recently acquired Kosmos Cement Business) average net Cement sales prices increased 3%. Cement sales volume for the year was a record 7.5 million tons, up 26%. Organic annual Cement sales volume increased 1%.

Fourth quarter Cement revenue, including Joint Venture and intersegment revenue, was up 17% to $171.0 million. Excluding the results of the recently acquired Kosmos Cement Business, revenue was down 1%. Operating earnings decreased 6% to $23.2 million. Eagle’s fourth quarter Cement earnings were affected by a severe winter storm during February 2021 which had a significant impact on Texas and the broader Southern United States. Our cement facilities in Texas, Missouri and Oklahoma were forced to curtail production during the storm and energy prices spiked during this time period. We estimate the storm’s impact on Cement operating earnings was approximately $6 million primarily due to higher costs during the quarter. We are still engaged in discussions with contractual counterparties regarding the responsibility for certain charges and obligations arising as a result of the storm, and therefore, it is not possible at the present time to make a final determination as to the storm’s impact on our financial results.

The average net Cement sales price for the quarter increased 2% to $112.77 per ton. Organic average net Cement sales prices increased 3%. Cement sales volume for the quarter was up 17% to a record 1.4 million tons. Organic quarterly Cement sales volume declined 2% to 1.1 million tons.

Fiscal 2021 revenue from Concrete and Aggregates decreased 7% to $168.7 million because of the divestiture of our northern California concrete and aggregates businesses during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Concrete and Aggregates reported fiscal 2021 operating earnings of $19.1 million, up 9%, reflecting improved organic sales volume and pricing as well as operating efficiencies, including lower diesel fuel costs.

Fourth quarter Concrete and Aggregates revenue was $34.8 million, a decrease of 12%, because of the divestiture of our northern California concrete and aggregates businesses. Fourth quarter operating earnings were $3.3 million, a 30% increase, reflecting improved sales volume and pricing and improved operating efficiencies.

Light Materials: Gypsum Wallboard and Paperboard

Fiscal 2021 revenue in the Light Materials sector, which includes Gypsum Wallboard and Paperboard, increased 5%, reflecting improved Wallboard sales volume and pricing. Gypsum Wallboard annual sales volume was a record 2.9 billion square feet (BSF), up 6%, while the average Gypsum Wallboard net sales price increased 1% to $149.62 per MSF. Given the improved demand outlook for single-family construction activity in the US and increasing demand for our products, we implemented wallboard price increases during the second half of our fiscal year. We also announced a wallboard price increase for early April 2021.

Fiscal 2021 operating earnings were $192.8 million, an increase of 2%, driven by improved sales volume and pricing, partially offset by increased operating cost, primarily due to higher recycled fiber costs and startup costs associated with our paper mill expansion.

Fourth quarter Gypsum Wallboard and Paperboard revenue increased 15% to $176.9 million, reflecting improved Wallboard sales volume and pricing. Gypsum Wallboard sales volume increased 3% to 706 million square feet (MMSF), while the average Gypsum Wallboard net sales price increased 10% to $161.07 per MSF.

Paperboard sales volume for the quarter increased 4% to a record 82,000 tons. The average Paperboard net sales price for the fourth quarter was $481.40 per ton, up 5%, consistent with the pricing provisions in our long-term sales agreements.

Fourth quarter operating earnings in the sector were $52.4 million, an increase of 15%, reflecting improved Wallboard sales volume and pricing partially offset by the impact of the winter storm in February 2021. Our Oklahoma paper mill was forced to curtail production during the week of the storm and also experienced higher energy costs during the shutdown. Additionally, our wallboard shipments were significantly affected by the harsh winter conditions. We estimate the storm affected fourth quarter Light Materials operating earnings by approximately $6 million. We are still engaged in discussions with contractual counterparties regarding the responsibility for certain charges and obligations arising as a result of the storm, and therefore, it is not possible at the present time to make a final determination as to the storm’s impact on our financial results. Although the operating earnings of our Light Materials sector were adversely affected by the storm, we were able to curtail some of our operations and release a portion of our natural gas commitments to third parties in a timely manner. The release of these commitments contributed to a significant increase in Other Non-Operating Income in the fourth quarter.

Sale of Oil and Gas Proppants Business

On September 18, 2020, the Company sold its Oil and Gas Proppants business to Smart Sand, Inc. The current-year and prior-year financial results of the Oil and Gas Proppants segment have been classified as Discontinued Operations on the Statement of Earnings. The assets and liabilities of the Oil and Gas Proppants segment have been reflected on separate lines for Discontinued Operations on the Balance Sheet.

Details of Financial Results

We conduct one of our cement plant operations through a 50/50 joint venture, Texas Lehigh Cement Company LP (the Joint Venture). We use the equity method of accounting for our 50% interest in the Joint Venture. For segment reporting purposes only, we proportionately consolidate our 50% share of the Joint Venture’s revenue and operating earnings, which is consistent with the way management organizes the segments within Eagle for making operating decisions and assessing performance.

In addition, for segment reporting purposes, we report intersegment revenue as a part of a segment’s total revenue. Intersegment sales are eliminated on the consolidated statement of earnings. Refer to Attachment 3 for a reconciliation of these amounts.

The amount bullshit or selective use of statistics by the clickbait headlines and the bears on social media is pissing me off so I’m doing another post to help those who follow me sift through the bullshit.  When evaluating your investment decisions (whether you want to short lumber or go long, I don’t personally care which your preference is) it is important you understand what is actually going on, what some of these terms actually mean and what inferences can *actually* be drawn from the data.  If you go by what the clickbait out there is feeding you, you will likely get burned.

**Western SPF lumber futures ARE NOT the same as current Lumber Prices **

The lumber futures contracts traded in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are futures contracts for a very specific type of dimensional lumber: Western SPF KD 2x4 #2&Btr.  It is not the current price of “lumber” that wholesalers or builders are currently paying this week for new orders.  Nor is it a predictor of what lumber will be at the month of expiration. [For example, here’s a screenshot from ~ first week of February 2021 showing the price of futures when Western SPF cash prices were about $950.](https://imgur.com/a/GQOfvFD)  It is simply a helpful indicator.

There are many different types of lumber products that sell at many different prices.  If you are not using the CME to trade WSPF futures, it is simply one of many data points to be used to assess the general state of the industry.  It is not always an accurate reflection of the current price of lumber.  (It may be important to Google “Backwardation vs Contago” before you start drawing inferences on these futures price patterns.)

The cash or “Spot” market is what builders/wholesalers buying from the mills are paying RIGHT NOW for the new orders of lumber.  So when you here Lumber twitter talking about spot price, they are talking about cash prices right now.

The Random Lengths composite number is another cash price indicator; an average price of the main various types of dimensional lumber being sold that week.  It is the closest thing to a single price of dimensional lumber out there.  BTW, the Composite is up this week (~$1500 USD), and it was up last week.

The main lumber spot prices are also updated every week by Madison’s lumber Report.  You have to pay to get access to their reports, same with Random Length’s composite.  But sometimes you’ll get free posts, like this one: [Madison’s Lumber Reporter](https://madisonsreport.com/).  Also you can get people on Lumber twitter posting where cash markets are for the day, like the tweet up above.

**Is the Price of Lumber Crashing?  NO! Or not yet at least**

Let me start by saying, Lumber is not sustainable at $1400-$1600 mbf.  No one in the industry wants lumber that high because it is not sustainable. Lumber prices need a healthy correction, sooner rather than later.  

That being said, there’s been a lot of chicken littles panicking and bears celebrating because the lumber futures market has been limit down from 1700 to ~1200 in the last week.  THIS IS NOT THE PRICE OF LUMBER.  The spot price of lumber HAS NOT dropped steadily for the last seven days. (See Madison Report) [https://imgur.com/a/WArizXg].  In fact it has been rising, and is projected to CONTINUE to rise in the short term due to demand. [Go to the last section of this Bloomberg Article for a sensible discussion of Lumber’s immediate future]( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/plunge-in-lumber-contracts-signals-turning-point-for-wood-rally).  

Will the cash drop at some point? YES, probably soon (next 1-2 months).  Does it need to drop? YES! It probably is not sustainable long term on these prices and we want the industry to do well for years; not months.  Even if lumber dropped 50% from its current cash price (~$1500 USD) to ~$750, and then that became a new base for the next few years, those years would be the best years in industry history, other than 2021.   

**So why are lumber futures crashing if price isn’t?**

I don’t know for certain, but likely a combination of things.  With the surge in prices, speculators piled into the futures market and drove up the price, hit and top and then surged out.  Now we are seeing a bit of capitulation. (google it).  With that run up, apparently there was [a bit of a short squeeze on lumber]( https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-lumber-trader-stinson-dean-164741704.html) that is now over.  Also, the futures market very recently increased the margin requirements, which may have further pushed out some speculators.  Now we have a big drop, maybe healthy overcorrection, and these futures will get back to reasonable backwardation.

**Implications for the Lumber Stocks**

For those considering liquidating shares or buying puts on lumber right now, context is very important.  Go look at historical price of lumber.  Current July futures has dropped all the way to $1250 mfb (USD).  If the average price of dimensional lumber drops all the way to ~$800-900 mbf (USD) which is still another 30% drop from current Futures price, and if lumber remained that way for a year, **it would be the best year in the industry’s history.**  

These lumber companies’ stock prices are currently valued at an annual lumber runrate of $500-$550 and are sitting at about the same as their 2018 stock price which had an average price of ~$500 mbf USD for the year. This post is not about debating what that means for future value and I am not telling you what to do, but it is an important consideration regardless of what your perspective is on these cyclicals.

**But CNBC said housing starts had a HUGE drop. So doesn’t that mean demand is cratering due to high prices? NO!**

I literally saw this question on twitter and facepalmed.  April housing start data was released today.  Everyone had their spin on it.  Clickbait sources added dramatic language to make it sound like everything is crashing because it fits the fear mongering narrative.  

Let’s look at it from both sides and see what it actually says and what it doesn’t’ say. Here’s the US Census link so you can read it yourself. [Link](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf)  Here’s the Wellsfargo link with a better breakdown. [Link](https://externalcontent.blob.core.windows.net/pdfs/pdfs/8173fa2e-3b8d-4239-bce0-b34b022d540a.pdf)

**The Basic Numbers**

US Housing starts for April 2021 came out to an annual rate of 1.569 million housing units.  That is a 9% decrease from the annualized rate in March 2021, which was 1.733 million.  However it also was a **67% increase** from the prior year April 2020 which was 938K housing starts. 

Obviously comparing to April 2020 can give a misleading impression of current trends given what was going on back then.   I added it because CNBC, the other media outlets and Inflation-Twitter used the year-over-year metric from the CPI numbers in order to more effectively push the fear-mongering inflation narrative. Whereas now they back to the MoM metric in order to get the most clicks.  

US Housing permit numbers are up to annual rate of 1.76 million; a slight increase (.3%) from March’s permit numbers and a 61% increase from April 2020.  

Single Family housing starts (which consume the most lumber) were down 13.4% from March 2021.  Multi-Family homes were up at 470K.  Single Family home completions for April 2021 were at a rate of 1.045 million; a .1% increase over March 2020.

**Is the Sky Falling? No or not yet anyways.**

Housing starts are down from the prior month and it was unexpected.  That absolutely can be the beginning of a headwind forming for the homebuilders and lumber stocks.  Frankly, it is quite possible we will see even more decline in housing starts in the May numbers that will be released in June.  But in reality, until we are seeing multiple straight months of substantial declining housing starts, then it’s just noise.  

Yes, there are anecdotal stories of developers throttling back due to lack of supplies or uncertainty in prices. This data is consistent with those preliminary reports.  However, there’s also a massive amount of anecdotal evidence pointing in the opposite direction. [Like this great example of a national homebuilder reporting they have sold out all of there spec homes AND lots in NC!!!]( https://twitter.com/MattBrubakerNC/status/1394787807978311680)

This report was a hiccup and unexpected, but this report had a massive amount of silver linings, when you factor in the context, none of which are really acknowledged by the clickbait articles or social media.

**So WHY are housing starts down then?**

Well, the clickbait implies it’s from Lumber prices, along with other commodity prices.  While that may be the case for a small percentage of the smaller builders/contractors, that thesis doesn’t make sense when you look at the big picture.  

1) When lumber jumped ~300% over the course of 2020 and early 2021, that appeared to have literally no impact on the rate of housing starts.  To the contrary, building rates increased during this time!  All of a sudden that 67% increase in starts YoY becomes a bit more relevant…  The idea that the price increases from March to April all of a sudden caused a 13% drop in single family homes, while demand still surged, is silly.

2) The social/clickbait medias literally ran these EXACT same headlines in February when the January housing numbers dropped ~6% from December’s numbers.  “HOUSING STARTS DOWN AMIDST A SURGE IN LUMBER PRICES.” It sells and is easy for people to understand, but correlation does not equal causation.  Shark attacks increase in the US when Ice cream sales go up.  Does that mean one causes the other? No.  It means both increase during the summer when more people are eating ice cream and swimming in the ocean due to the heat.  Same principle applies here with these housing starts numbers and the futures surge.

The reality is **the builders simply don’t have sufficient supplies or labor** to sustain that build rate (1.7 mill annual starts) right now, and apparently there were some weather issues in the south as well.  [Wells Fargo Article discussing exactly this](https://externalcontent.blob.core.windows.net/pdfs/pdfs/8173fa2e-3b8d-4239-bce0-b34b022d540a.pdf).  In other words, housing starts are mostly constrained by what we have supplies to build which shouldn’t really surprise anyone given the next point:

**April housing starts were at or close to the NA Lumber Industry’s max production capacity**

West Fraser recently put out a presentation on the status of North America’s current lumber [production capacity in terms of housing starts from 2020 data.  [Here’s the Link of the graph](https://imgur.com/a/uQhI6V4).  Based on data from the FEA and NAHB, by the end of 2020, North America really only had the ability to produce lumber for about ~1.5 million housing starts a year.  The lumbers mills are working to improve efficiencies, and maybe that number has gone up a bit (maybe 5-10% by end of the year?).  But nothing major because it takes multiple years to build sawmills and get them operational.  

So what does that mean?  From another angle, April’s housing start numbers are essentially at NA’s current lumber production capacity despite these records prices.  [Probably why the lumber companies were reporting bullish new like this only two weeks ago.]( https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sawmills-selling-boards-faster-cut-142931825.html)  Not exactly a great indicator of an imminent crash in lumber prices *to pre pandemic levels* which is what certain people online want you to think is about to happen.  

**Immediate Future Outlook Also Shows High Demand**

The housing permits increase, despite the surge in lumber prices, shows that builder sentiment is still overall positive and there is even more demand in line waiting for lumber.  The major home builders have passed on the costs to consumers with little problem so far. This is a strong support for the “higher for longer” crowd who have been predicting lumber will stay at historically high margins for longer than 2021 Q2 (which ends in 6 weeks…).

To get some historical context on how much pent-up supply-constrained home construction demand we have: The proportion of authorized housing construction which haven’t begun construction yet is now at the highest level since 1979. [Link](https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1394638539900469252)  That’s a lot of people waiting in line outside the venue, trying to get in.  Would you expect concert ticket prices to drop when there’s a line half-mile long outside the venue…?  

You can also review Chief Economist/Housing Market Expert [Ali Wolf’s twitter feed](https://twitter.com/AliWolfEcon?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) for non-stop anecdotes and stats demonstrating how the new housing market is STILL booming despite these high lumber costs. 

**2020’s Biggest Driver of Lumber Demand Projected to Keep Growing**

According to FEA and other trade groups, the biggest end-use of lumber in 2020 was the renovation sector. [Link to Graphic](https://imgur.com/a/qxsP0i6).  Anecdotally, a lot of people have been saying that they will delay projects because lumber costs too much.  And a bunch of Youtube “economists/investigative journalists” like to go to Home Depot or Lumber yards to show all the wood still there (as if that were valid field research) and cry conspiracy.  And it makes sense that with more people returning to work and the economy reopening that DIY would go down.  

However, the Joint Center for Housing Studies at this place called Harvard University (America’s favorite safety school?) has projected the opposite. [link to study] (https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/press-releases/remodeling-upturn-carry-2022).  While they acknowledge that the smaller DIY projects and renovations are tapering off, the larger professional jobs are picking up.  Demand will stay were it is for the rest of the year and then likely pick up even more in Q1 2022.  It is partly due to jobs that were put off during the pandemic closures, but also from people making more investments in their home because of the current housing market. 

Also, the Home Depot CFO also confirmed that from their side, they are still seeing strong demand on the renovation side from their end and don't expect it to drop any time soon. [Link to earnings call transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/18/home-depot-hd-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)  

Takeaway, I have no doubt that there has been some decrease in demand for lumber from the DIY crowd, but that the drop in demand isn’t as bad as youtube makes it look like and any demand that fell from DIYers is likely being covered by demand from another source: the professional renovations. 

**But isn’t this 2005 all over again thus crash imminent? Not Yet**

There are some things that this housing market has in common with 2005/2006.  But there are also many things that this market does not have in common.  I am not going to get into the differences in the health of the financial markets vs now.  They are different.  A large portions of the home loans are sub-prime mortgage loans.  If you have credible data to the contrary, please share.  

Also, I am not trying to suggest that housing will stay on it’s current manic trajectory.  The housing market is not healthy and at some point it will slow down dramatically or it will correct.  But that’s probably not happening in the next couple months.

From a Supply/Demand standpoint, 2005/2006 are extremely different from today.  Is the housing market manic right now? Yes.  Prices are rocketing up like crazy, similar to ‘05/’06. However, the fundamentals driving this housing market surge is different.   

Inventory of available homes is dramatically different.  In 2005/2006, home prices were shooting through the roof even though the inventory of available homes was also shooting up. [Link to graphic](https://imgur.com/a/bZwtnqd).  On top of that, the US was at an annualized rate of ~2.1 million home starts in 2005.  

So the market was *flooded* with new homes on top of existing available inventory.  For awhile people kept paying more and more for those homes, ignoring the basic economic principle of supply/demand.  However, we have the opposite problem now: there aren’t enough homes to go around.  We are currently at a record low supply of homes compared to demand/population.  So, from that perspective, there is at least a rational basis for the price to soar: scarcity.  Something that wasn’t present then.

The same thing difference exists for lumber supply capacity in NA.  In 2005/2006, NA lumber production/capacity was around ~75 billion board feet.  Current production capacity at end of 2020 was just under 60 billion Board feet. [Link for Graphic](https://imgur.com/a/31E3Aue).  The industry plans to increase its capacity by making some new mills right now, but that will taking another year or more and it’s nothing dramatic that will substantially change the calculus in the next 1-2 years.

So unlike 2005, while the surge in home prices is similar to 2005, the market conditions causing that price surge are fundamentally different, so it is unclear if any credible inferences can be drawn from that time period in assessing our current cycle.

**TLDR:** There are a bunch of morons out there throwing around terms they don’t understand and drawing conclusions that aren’t supported by the larger datasets.  Lumber prices are still rising, even though futures are dropping.  The cash price of lumber WILL correct this summer, but likely not to pre pandemic levels. Make sure you do your homework before making investment decisions regarding housing/lumber.  I am not a financial advisor.    

If anyone identifies flaws in the analysis, please share.  I’d really like to know if I’m missing something here because when I go online and read the commentary, I feel like I am taking crazy pills.

**Disclosure:** I hold lumber and building materials tickers: RFP, LPX, and WFG."

This guy works in a lumber yard and talks about lumber prices extensively. In this video, he essentially says that future prices are dropping because supply is meeting demand and inventory is starting to build up for certain lumber products. That does not mean you the end consumer will see an immediate drop in prices because retailers bought the wood at a certain price and need to break even before buying new wood at a cheaper price."

2021-05-19 10:37:38,stocks,"SPF lumber is considered perfect for residential and commercial framing construction because of its reasonable price and high strength to weight ratio. It is widely used in North America for wood-frame construction, and thus random length lumber futures help to give a good idea as to where lumber prices stand in the US (Since its the most widely used lumber for frame construction, alongside its other uses). On a contract with minimal volume, you would expect to see variations between settlement price, and futures closing price."

2021-05-19 15:58:21,stocks,"Yup, as someone who buys a lot of lumber, I can say inventory was pathetic for most of the past year, anything you needed to order was backordered and all the bins at the lumber yard were mostly empty with a bunch of curly fry warped crap if you were lucky enough to find anything. 

Now every yard I'm in is stacked to the gills. It's only a matter of time before competitive forces take over and the price drops. Which is good because I'm delaying two large multi floor porches, a deck, and am entire waterfront worth of seawall and docks until the price gets more reasonable."

I wish every time one of my stocks tanked I could just will it back to a profit because I need to break even lol.

So if supply is up, inventory is building up, but demand is reduced by the current excessive pricing, should we expect a glut and overcorrection on the price in the future?"

2021-05-19 10:26:07,stocks,"I think the probability of $6 or higher increases every week.

Right now the range is 4-6. In order for that to happen lumber cash prices have to crash hard (close to pre pandemic levels) in the next couple months. There is a building consensus that won’t happen due to elevated demand. These analysts calling 4-6 have had to do about half a dozen upward revisions the last fee quarters. There may be another. But we need to see where lumber settles after mid summer to get a better idea."

The problem with lumber stocks is that they've already ran up considerably. It was an amazing call anytime last year,"
2021-05-19 18:57:49,stocks,Im up ~200%. Could liquidate now be a happy camper. 😎
2021-05-19 12:27:31,stocks,Not in the long run for lumber stocks close to yearly highs.

2021-05-19 19:01:55,stocks,"I entered RFP at the start of the year. Up ~250% between shares and calls. Bought small amounts of wfg and lpx on the dip down. If lumber done, i sell it and will have made a killing. 

Reddit is small potatoes money wise. I dont do this for the pump. Don’t need it and don’t believe in that. I have gotten a lot of private messages over the months from people asking questions on this stuff so I do these posts to help those handful of redditors who are less sophisticated and unable to navigate this stuff themselves."
2021-05-19 18:18:23,stocks,Good point but I'm not sure why he is pissed off. Says so at the very beginning of his super long post. Contemplating up vote just for effort.
2021-05-19 19:00:08,stocks,I could say 300% but no one is checking. Why are you really pissed off?
2021-05-19 12:37:31,stocks,"I should have clarified. Its good that they get to a sustainable level. If they settle at 800-1000, and trade that way for foreseeable future, that would be incredible for the lumber industry, which has had limber fluctuate from 350-450 for over a decade. 

The are trading at 2018 highs which had lumber at 500. The analysts and the market have so far refused to acknowledge yet that lumber would settle higher than ~500 after the summer surge. If an equilibrium is found at a much higher base like more people in the industry are starting to project, all these stocks are going higher."
2021-05-19 13:44:59,stocks,"My guesses on wfg are 1) BAM essentially selling its entire holdings (like 20% of all wfg outstanding shares) on open market in Q1 and Q2 probably flooded the bids; 2) it only started on NYSE in february, and options started only 2 weeks ago. 3) maybe also just the high stock price (even though its a small float) maybe scared away some retail or 4) theybhavent really given any good indication as to what theybplan to do with the few billion in earnings they will make this year, or the 1.4 billion in cash they have on hand.  But i am really stumped because the amount of money they are about to make the next few quarters compared to market cap is just ridiculous."
2021-05-19 10:38:54,stocks,"It would be great for the canadian companies. They put cash aside for the duties. When duty is lifted, its an instant windfall for them. Happened last time US pulled their lumber tariffs. I think RFp has close to 240$ million set aside (aka 3$ EPS). But also, many of these Canadian companies own US mills, so the tarriff doesnt affect a decent part of their revenue. 

The price of lumber may drop a bit but not much. The tariff already got dropped to 9% for some of them and that obviously didn’t have a huge impact."
2021-05-19 19:05:04,stocks,Yeah so RFP was an amazing pick for you but I think it's nearing the ceiling and too volatile for a near ath add.
2021-05-19 19:08:13,stocks,Too much time online reading people say things they don’t know what they are talking about.
2021-05-19 19:11:57,stocks,"You may be right. I certainly am not telling anyone to buy right now. Way Too much uncertainty and volatility at the moment. We’ll have to see. It depends where the lumber price settles. If it goes back to pre pandemic and holds, the forestries will tank. If the new base price settles and holds substantially higher than historical average, then the valuations may change if it’s sustainable. Time will tell and luckily i have a solid profit buffer to ride the wave."

2021-05-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Performant Financial (PFMT) - The Facts On May 13 the company reported earnings. The stock reaction has been muted due to low volume. The intense volatility in the name has slowed, as a FEW sophisticated  investors have accumulated meaningful starter positions (emphasis on only a few).  The earnings release and recent news has addressed and alleviated the lingering concerns by investors over:
-Student loans business- Contracts are being sold off.  Company will focus on healthcare business
-Debt- covenents have been renegotiated into more favorable terms. Proceeds from sale of Student Loans contracts will be used to pay off some debt to the point of easily manageable levels
-Healthcare business- continues to grow. More contracts secured. Mgmt also confirmed a robust pipeline of new contracts in the works. Margins expected to be 30% sustainably once we re-open

Like everyone, the quarter was impacted by covid. no surprise. The first unaffected quarter will be rockstar- hitting the screens of all investors that are currently unaware. As a turnaround story these companys cannot be easily found.

1)
On the conference call, we see for the first time two institutional investor participants.
Chris Krug- Chatham Harbor Capital (AUM unknown)
and
Craig Melcher- Tudor Investment Corporation (AUM 45B+, even small cap funds would have significant size)

During the conference call, these investors asked critical questions ot which management provided reassuring feedback and responses. What we draw fomr this is that new players in the institutional landscape are vocally following this name.

2)
A few days ago, the institutionally well-followed podcast known as The Contrarian Investor Podcast recently hosted an episode with Chris Krug above. (Link: contrarianpod....dot...com). in which Chris pitches PFMT as a table punding buy. Fast forward to 15 minutes 40 seconds. I recommend everyone listen to this pitch as he does an excellent job of simplifying a complicated company. Especially helpful for those sitting on the fence unsure whether to buy stock.


3)
An exclusive online investing network known as CoInvestor Club (coinvestorclub......dot.....com/) , followed by a many of NOrth Americas top hedgefund, micro/small/mid-cap portfolio managers, and high networth accredited investors has recently announced in their weekly newsletter and posted on twitter (@CoINvestorCLub1) that they will be hosting Chris Krug TOMORROW Wednesday May 19 to present his BEST investment idea- no other details shared.  Given the recent events, it is very likely that Chris continues to pitch PFMT. Volume uptick into the close today confirms this could be the case.

These new investors see the underlying value in Performant and have clearly done a thorough due dilligence. Expect a sophisticated educational campaign to initiate in the insitutional investing world. These are no longer small retail investors but large funds that will push the price much higher. Tomorrows presentation is only the begining. Expect many value and micro cap investors to be tuning in. Once PFMT is confirmed to be the best idea, expect a pop in the price. As well as continued spreading through word of mouth, mgmt appearing at investor conferences to generate exposure to investors. This was a $1B market cap company not too long ago.  This could be the last opportunity to buy this turnaround company at cheap levels before the coming multiple re-rate bring it to $8+ or it gets acquired at a significant  premium."

2021-05-19 09:11:04,stocks,"Nice post! This is juicy
Consider that there is a time lag for investors to do their own due dilligence before buying. So we have an advantage since we've been following. Ill be buying more"

2021-05-19 14:11:21,stocks,Expect it will be difficult to accumulate stock as all current holders know its worth 4X. Shortage of supply + new institutional demand will drive it higher soon
2021-05-19 09:11:31,stocks,Thank you for piecing this together. Good journalism
2021-05-19 10:06:02,stocks,The market is shyte today. Great opportunity to buy while noone else is.
2021-05-19 11:32:04,stocks,Definitely would put it on the map. Getting exposure with asset managers is the next catalyst. Company fundamentals on track.

2021-05-19 11:44:18,stocks,"If this hedge fund manager can explain the story of PFMT in a way that is easy to understand, im certain the stock will attract large buyers in near future. Agree with comment above that there will be tim lag as asset manager do their own work/DD. The stock is dirt cheap. Proven that their turn around has been succesful. Now its all about buying stock before enough people recognize this opportunity and bid it much higher"
2021-05-19 19:18:48,stocks,"Great question, thanks for asking! 

The ownership number youre looking at is stale. Lisa Im likely owns  3% of the company if not more, with more options available.
Thats triple the stake owned by the next largest CEO ownership stake of the competition with HMSY ceo owning less than 0.95% before the sale. Management has a healthy ownership stake in PFMT that comfortably aligns their interests with other shareholders"
2021-05-19 11:41:37,stocks,Thanks
2021-05-19 11:44:50,stocks,Good points. Agree with you
2021-05-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Distributing vs Accumulating ETF Fonds Hi

I read about accumulating ETF Fonds, for example this one: [Xtrackers MSCI World UCITS ETF 1C | 24869934 | IE00BJ0KDQ92 (justetf.com)](https://www.justetf.com/ch/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BJ0KDQ92#overview). In theory this sounds great for a long term strategy, since your dividends are directly reinvested, without you having to do that manually again and therefore have new fees to pay. Especially in Switzerland, since we pay taxes on dividends but not on capital gains. But I wonder, since there you don't get more shares with that, since there is no rebuy, isn't that kind of a gamble? 

From what I understand, the idea is that when there is more money in the fonds the value and with that the price of a share goes up. But since the price of one share is not directly linked to the money in the fonds isn't there a real danger that the dividends are reinvested and the price of a share goes down nonetheless and therefore you just losing basically the dividends? Or is my thinking off?"
2021-05-19 12:08:08,stocks,"Your thinking is slightly off.

The value of an ETF is the total assets divided by the shares outstanding.

When they get the dividends these count as assets.

When a stock issues a dividend the market usually arbitrages the stock price lower by the dividend amount.

So the dividends plus the stock price is a constant and it all remains in the ETF assets.

It's ETFs that distribute dividends that would lose intrinsic value over time, if stock prices don't appreciate."
2021-05-19 08:40:54,stocks,you do get more shares because the underlying portfolio grows with the reinvested cash. 99 times out of 100 i would (and do) choose accumulating ETFs over distributing ones.
2021-05-19 12:18:20,stocks,"But isn't it a possible scenario that an ETF has a Value of let's say 100, but on the market there is no buyer that goes higher than 95, therefore the stock price of the ETF going below the value of it's assets? Or is that something that in theory is possible in practice just won't happen or only very short term?"
2021-05-19 09:21:59,stocks,"yeah, I see that. But I mean, I can only sell my share at the fonds and not the shares in the fonds in the end. So isn't it real possibility that the share price of the fonds just doesn't grow the same amount as the money that is reinvested so that you would had have more if you just got the dividend? Or is that something that goes in the category of possible but very unlikely?"
2021-05-19 13:52:57,stocks,"Unless the ETF is extremely thinly traded or somehow impaired, the market will quickly arbitrage it back to the NAV. The bigger risk there is if the actual NAV and the number you happen to find on whatever website aren't the same."
2021-05-19 15:04:47,stocks,"I see, makes sense. Thank you very much!"

At Target’s stores and on its website, traffic grew by 17% and basket size grew by 5% in the three-month period compared with a year earlier.

Similar to Costco, I trust when I buy something from Target it will be decent quality, particularly their in-house brands.  Walmart and Amazon are such crap-shoots on quality.  Their major advantages have been cost, selection, and shipping, but I think Target has made progress on all of these to close the gap."

There is no fee, you wait tops 2 hours for your order to be ready and it always comes out under 5 minutes, even when it’s busy. I barely wait 3 minutes when I go. You don’t have to call, you just use the app. I’ve tried 3 other places where one of them (Hannaford - a grocery store) you have to pick a time slot and it’s always next day or 2 days depending on when you order, you have to call when you get there, and I’m always waiting 5-10 minutes. There is also a $5 fee unless you order over $100.

One thing I'm curious about is how much the Pandemic effects on increase in business at select retailers will wear away. Large big box stores had an easier time adjusting to the shopping needs of the pandemic.

On the flip-side, the pandemic might have pushed both consumers and retailers to try new business models that will help counteract online e-commerce only companies.

People now know how to do curbside pick ups, in-store pick ups and retailers have learned how to handle more consumers doing that. This might give some retailers a quicker adjustment to new strategies to work with their own e-commerce operations or become more convenient option vs. competition from e-commerce only. In a way the pandemic pushed people into new strategies and some might last."

2021-05-19 10:34:53,stocks,"Not only is the actual process of curbside pickup great but the integration into the website and mobile app is excellent as well. Combine that with how well Shipt was integrated into the website/app and you have a very strong product across a variety of sales channels. And they did all of this before Covid so they were in a perfect position to take advantage of changing shopping behavior due to Covid. Even little things like showing you which aisle a product is in and a map of the store were huge innovations when they launched.

These sorts of innovations also help immunize Target against competitors like Amazon. After Target Canada imploded, Target really focused on improving the website and app in addition to integrating curbside pickup and Shipt. All of that paid massive dividends."

2021-05-19 09:50:35,stocks,"Edit/preface: I do not own any target stock at the time of writing.  
Personally I been shopping more on target because I gave up on amazon. Amazon's been flooded with cheap poor quality products and from what I understand has been having issues with fake brand items due to the way they operate(multiple stores in one listing and warehouse putting different store but same items together). I initially turned to ebay, but similar cheap poor products turns up on searches and I have to figure out which seller I can trust with the branded items. Target's selection is more limited, but at least I can trust the quality of the products more, they ship quickly(arrives 2 days or less for me), and they also deliever food."

2021-05-19 13:05:17,stocks,Absolutely. Last earnings they said they were investigating $4b into their digital sales channel which for me is extremely bullish if they execute well on top of how they've already been doing.
2021-05-19 12:40:12,stocks,"Target definitely has room for innovativation. It’s nowhere near as innovative as amazon.



If Target offered 1-2 day shipping, it would be a serious competitor to amazon. I think walmart already started doing this."

2021-05-19 10:01:07,stocks,Q1 was super low because Q1 is also super low.  Also many stores were hard limiting items to ensure availability was there for all.  Q1 2020 was an anomaly.

2021-05-19 12:04:22,stocks,Target is where people go pay a little more to avoid people of Walmart.
2021-05-19 11:01:09,stocks,"You’re wrong. Every time I’ve been in one of them for the last two years, people have at least some groceries in their carts. It’s been a massive change for them to take a bite out of the grocery industry, not to mention their homes decor and furniture for low budget shoppers has apparently been wildly successful. Their stores are nicer than Walmart and no where near as much as a pain as places like Ikea. They’re hitting a local market with convenience and pricing."
2021-05-19 13:17:02,stocks,"Sort of a lazy analysis that seems to be too effected by your personal consumer opinions. Don't make investing choices on your consumer tastes. I buy from failing retailers all the time and I invest in stores with a good strategy that I'd never use.

The retail market, besides adjusting to E-commerce competitors, is also adjusting to shifting changes in income distribution int he country. Long term, we live in a society where 25-30% of society has more wealth than in the past and the bottom 70% has stagnant or wealth decreases.

This means retail markets are forced to adjust one way or another. They have to attract higher tier, but fewer shoppers (fewer locations) or they have to attract attract masses that are more budget conscious. 

They never made a large of a move into grocery super centers, as Wal-Mart did. However, they have made a large move into clothing, on top of their existing home goods. They've created a line up that is less like Wal-Mart, but competes better with cheaper clothes retails, such as Kohl's.

This is important, because they can grab market share from that 70% that can no longer afford to go to a typical Mall-based anchor or a specialty clothing store. However, they have to create better clothes and brand identities to attract them. This means they have some traction doing that.

That is partly why Mall chains and anchors, except for a few, have done so poorly. The business model is dependent on a stronger middle and lower-middle class. While e-commerce is certainly played a larger role, there are spots in the market for some retailers to take market share from others failing to adjust or unable to adjust to the new market.

&#x200B;

This same effect is why Bed Bath & Beyond is struggling, but higher tier stores with fewer locations, like Williams Sonoma are doing well. On the lower 70% of the market, Wal-Mart, Target, and Amazon are able to take market share from stores that use to cater in the middle of these two different price tiers."

2021-05-19 10:25:07,stocks,"Same here. I dropped Amazon right around the start of COVID time last year and don’t miss it at all. I use Target drive up at least once a week and prices are comparable, sometimes better now, than Amazon."
2021-05-19 10:44:46,stocks,This. I really don’t know why Amazon is so popular as a retail (not stock). Half the shit on there now is like third party poor quality crap and the things you do try to buy legitimately? Could end up fake if you don’t specifically check out the seller
2021-05-19 12:36:26,stocks,"Same here. If Target had a better selection of electronics, I'm not sure that I'd use Amazon for much of anything. Curbside is so easy and so well done that I prefer to buy at Target than to wait for a box from Amazon.

That's especially true because Amazon's shipping is hit or miss these days  (and we live just a few miles from one of their distribution hubs). When they're not delivering my packages to my neighbors, they're marking orders as delivered when they haven't yet arrived or they're just losing packages altogether.

I've got a next-day order right now that was placed three days ago and it's still ""On the way, but it's running late."" They can't even give me a delivery date."

2021-05-19 14:29:39,stocks,"In its specialties, like store brand groceries and home goods, Amazon doesn't hold a candle to it. And curbside pick up is its jam. I'd say Target should continue to cater to BECKY and the in store experience, and it's golden. Shipt can do same day delivery IIRC, by the way!"

2021-05-19 10:12:17,stocks,"If you live in a rural area you're much more likely to have access to a Wal-Mart than a Target. If you live in the burbs, probably both."
2021-05-19 10:19:43,stocks,"I'd say the Wal-Mart ""Neighborhood Markets"" are a bit more suburban and Target-esque. The regular Wal-Mart superstores (with their really cheap prices) definitely cater to a lower SES population on the whole, even if their 24 hour convenience and selling of almost every kind of good means all sorts of people stop in once in a while. 

Another factor is that a lot of middle or upper-middle class folks also won't shop at Wal-Mart for ethical reasons, if they can afford to and/or have the option to shop elsewhere, which many lower SES families don't have the privledge of caring about (just want the cheapest price for their shopping)."
2021-05-19 10:09:05,stocks,Target tends to cater to a more affluent customer than Walmart. Also Walmart’s are more likely to be in rural towns.

2021-05-19 09:45:35,stocks,"Interesting he sold GM; I can see price appreciation when they roll out their ev line for a big market segment. I can understand the risk too, but I am biased to believe they will do well."
2021-05-19 07:47:09,stocks,Surprised to see Snowflake.
2021-05-19 11:52:05,stocks,Why the unloading of Suncor?
2021-05-19 10:38:21,stocks,Are VOO and SPY same ? One is Vanguard and another SPDR ?
2021-05-19 10:27:06,stocks,"Btw, aren’t many of these buys Ted & Todd, rather than Buffet himself?"
2021-05-19 10:28:01,stocks,Didn't he also buy some Japanese stocks?
2021-05-19 10:14:42,stocks,"i didn't expect them to sold trio MRK, BMY and ABBV so fast.

any reason?

business is still solid and valuation still reasonable."
2021-05-19 17:29:39,stocks,I saw that yesterday and immediately dumped my MRK stock for a small profit. I knew this move likely meant MRK wouldn’t grow for a while.
2021-05-19 15:06:35,stocks,RH is interesting is interesting. Is Buffett betting on a work from home trend continuing? More money taken out of commercial real estate and into peoples homes?
2021-05-19 10:29:41,stocks,I agree w the VZ play. My only problem is I dont see much growth for VZ outside of the US.

2021-05-19 14:29:15,stocks,"While they may sell these EVs good, I think these sales will just replace their other cars and basically leave them where they were before. Now, I'm no expert so I don't know do they have better margin selling EVs or other lines 🤔 That would be interesting to research."

2021-05-19 13:05:42,stocks,I fuckin hate working with snowflake. That’s all I have to add.
2021-05-19 15:14:29,stocks,"Broadly the market is going against Suncor.

Things were looking up from 2016-2020.  They had bought out their direct competitor and owned a majority share in Canadian Oilsands.  With Trump in office it looked as though the Keystone XL was going to be built which would be a new major route for the company to ship its oil. On top of this the Canadian government bought the Trans Mountain Pipeline from Kinder Morgan with hopes of expanding it to further increase the company's exports.  It had amazing growth potential.

That's simply not the case anymore.  Keystone XL is dead and Trans Mountain is in some very long term construction delays that means it won't be operational for at least a couple more years.  Worse yet Michigan is considering ending export permits for the Line 5 pipeline would mean severe cuts in sales to Ontario.

I'm sure Suncor will be worth a very short term gain coming up as the US economy starts rolling again (and right now it's at an insanely discounted price after a lot of dumping).  I think Berkshire Hathaway's divesting is more about what happens 5-10 years from now."
2021-05-19 13:54:26,stocks,"He also just bought a big stake in Chevron, then sold half of it the very next quarter. I thought he was a long-term investor..."

2021-05-19 16:36:55,stocks,"Yeah maybe for the first few weeks, but after a month or two, everyone realizes life still sucks and the world will go back to its boring pre pandemic self. You underestimate how quick humans get bored of something “new”."
2021-05-19 13:43:51,stocks,"Honestly, not very well think like a semi-relational database with a GREAT sales team. I’m sure it’s great in some use cases like ingestion of large parquet sets or other semi structured datasets sitting on a data lake. HOWEVER, it’s version of referential integrity is far from what our management were sold on! I could go all day but I’ll stop here. The web UI is shit and I’m confident there’s likely a better tool for anything it claims to be the best at!"
2021-05-19 17:48:02,stocks,"You’re assuming things I didn’t say bro. 

Buffett is buying to anticipate an increase in consumer spending, I never ventured at how long that spending would last."

2021-05-19 07:05:44,stocks,Feels like paperhands are never punished anymore. Every stock that goes up drops a bunch shortly afterwards
2021-05-19 13:15:11,stocks,"Are people over at GME and Superstonk subreddits just completely batshit crazy and deluded? There's so much confirmation bias over there that I just don't trust it. Is it true that GME will actually go up loads when all the hedgefund people need to buy back the stocks? They act like its guaranteed, and I don't quite buy it or see any real evidence for the hedgefunds to buy back the stocks (surely they can find a way out of it) but haven't seen anyone refute it properly - anyone wanna give me their 2 cents?

2021-05-19 09:20:04,stocks,Been interested in LAC but i think it has some time yet before they turn a profit? Still it has come down a lot in price which makes their valuation more palatable
2021-05-19 12:16:42,stocks,Always has been...
2021-05-19 18:55:53,stocks,"Yes we’re crazy, and yes the price will get to eye watering levels, with almost mathematical certainty by now, and I have enough tact not to scream at any of the doubters “I told you so”. The heavy hitters and industry vets doing AMA’s over at r/superstonk engage in better quality, more well rounded debates than the congressional hearings have thus far. I have a substantial position in GME FYI, but many other self directed picks, some low risk stuff, physical metal, and no “coins”."
2021-05-19 12:21:12,stocks,"My thoughts on $LAC
They’re well positioned to meet the impending rise in demand for battery grade lithium carbonate in terms of their Argentinian project. Production will begin in 2022, they have a partnership with Gangfeng for a large amount of the product (70%) to be bought at market price insuring the company will have a off supply. Gangfeng just made moves to open a lithium battery operation in the same town as the Argentina mine, which gives me more indications that the mine will take off. Gangfeng is very well established and they sunk a considerable amount of money into developing the mine with LAC. LAC’s other operation is a bit more tenuous in terms of funding (they still need a major partner) but they have gotten a groundbreaking environmental document. I work in environmental regulations, the ROD they got for Thacker Pass puts them in a trajectory to meet the upcoming demand in 5-10 years. 

The lower price point should make it an easy stock to pick up, I’ll bet you’ll see a rise this year when they obtain their water rights and land rights for Thacker pass and in quarter one of 2022 when they announce production in Argentina. 

I’ve spent a good amount of time researching LAC, the lithium market, mining techniques as well as my background in environmental regulations. I think it’s a good long term bet (6 months to a year), and then an even better bet longer term since EV is on the rise including being supported by many governments like the US who just made a major pledge! There’s lots of areas I identified where you’ll see a price rise in the next year, buying now I feel confident that I’ll be able to sell off my shares at considerable profit. I currently have invested roughly 40% of my investment budget into them at 13.27 average a share.


Feel free to DM me if you have more questions, I was going to do a formal write up but I’m not sure what’s the acceptable format (and I think my karma is too low lol)"
2021-05-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Next Set of Trillion Dollar Companies? Aside from FB, I think the next set of trillion dollar companies will almost certainly come from the semiconductor and fintech industries. NVDA, TSM, V, and MA are all good candidates. JPM and BRK will also eventually get there but at a slower pace. What do you all think?"
2021-05-19 12:01:42,stocks,"If you look at the current trillion dollar companies they tend to have more than 1 major line of business bringing in big bucks, they also tend to have a lot of consumer and business customers. Microsoft for example has 3 main segments that all bring in around a third of their revenue, and they have both consumer and business clients. Amazon's main businesses are e-commerce (consumer facing) and AWS cloud services (business facing). Apple may get a ton of money from their iDevices, but they also bring in a lot of money from stuff like their app stores, and other hardware. A lot of businesses buy plenty of their devices to.

So a lot of businesses with only 1 main line of business, or that only deal with consumer or only business clients, probably aren't going to be trillion dollar companies."
2021-05-19 06:57:37,stocks,Kinda surprised no one mentioned Tencent
2021-05-19 06:53:56,stocks,"Looking at your two semi, I doubt NVDA. They already trade at a high multiple for their 300b valuation.  If they traded at a much lower multiplier (which will happen as the growth that's priced in now comes to fruition and shows) they would be marketed less as intc. 

Trillion dollar companies are generally backed by long term consistent growth,  but the Financials to support it.  Even if they quadruple Sales they are looking at half the revenue of most of these companies.  There will be a psychological barrier at that valuation to the market"

2021-05-19 06:48:11,stocks,"TSLA got up to like a $0.85T market cap somehow with no profits, I would think they have a decent chance if they can eventually turn a profit that's not from Bitcoin or carbon credits."
2021-05-19 08:02:19,stocks,I think it will be either Tencent or Baba. Both are giants and growing fast.

2021-05-19 09:35:28,stocks,"Xiaomi is well on its way.

It is amazing how big Xiaomi has become in the last 3 years. They sold more phones than Apple did last year and this for a company that has only been around for 11 years. The Mi 11 is an awesome phone and the quality and features very much in league with flagship Samsung or Apple phones. They have their fingers in so many pies and so far I am happy with every Xiaomi product I own.

There are a few things that might inhibit growth such as Chinese monopoly regulations and to a lesser degree US boycotting of products or trading in the stock such a Donald attempted.


In general I tend to stay away from Chinese products and stocks alike but I am a big Xiaomi fanboy."

2021-05-19 14:06:16,stocks,"I am doubtful on V and MA. Even if retailers never move to crypto by-passing payment gateways, their secret is out. Even country like India implemented UPI which provides zero fee digital transactions. Most banks and all fintech apps (including Whatsapp) have integrated it. I think if UPI keeps performing well for couple of more years, pressure will build on other developing countries to implement similar tech.

2021-05-19 07:08:55,stocks,"You could be right. But I'm very bullish on NVDA. 47% of their revenue is now from data centers. So they're not just dependent gaming and crypto for growth anymore. And given the massive strides they've taken in the AI and EV spaces, they should keep growing rapidly. IMO, the 81 or so multiple is not that high given their potential."
2021-05-19 06:46:54,stocks,Agreed. Completely slipped my mind. PayPal is a juggernaut of a business. They will probably get there in the next few years with V and MA.

People don't realize Tesla has a lot of temporary expenses that are either by choice (loan interest) or soon disappearing (Musk's stock-based compensation and deferred revenue). If you filter those are they are more profitable than people realize, even if you also filter out regulatory credits.

On top of that, Tesla's capital efficiency is already insanely strong and not slowing down. They've invested a ton of money into the casting presses that will only really start generating a return when the Model Y from Giga Texas/Berlin will start hitting the roads, as well as the Cybertruck and potentially the Semi and/or $25k model. Other automakers can only dream of being able to cast the entire front or rear underbody out of one piece, with all the cost, reliability and structural benefits associated with it. Their margins on the Model 3 are already very decent, imagine how the margin on the Texas/Berlin Model Y with all these cost cuts will be while having a higher price than Model 3."

I dont really see how you can think the stock price would increase anymore than what its currently at, given there is no logical reason why Tesla should be valued at 540B asides for random EV hype. Its easy for Tesla to hit high growth numbers right now when they only produced and sold something like 400 or 500k cars last year, as compared to other auto manufacturers selling multiple millions per year. I think people who are super bullish on Tesla only see a scenario where they are the largest player in the market and somehow Tesla has perfected self driving technology and has a fleet of taxis..I personally don't think any of that is going to happen."
2021-05-19 11:13:33,stocks,"If they can be the first to solve autonomy, they would have a car that can drive itself.  No reason to buy any other car.  They would need to scale and make several million cars per year.  Even after other companies solve autonomy, there would still be some brand loyalty to Telsa, much like the brand loyalty to Apple.

Then they would launch an app store in the cars.  Think how much Apple makes with app store.

They might launch a robotaxi network.  If they cannot scale fast enough they could lease the autonomous driving software to other companies as SaaS.

There is also there energy product, insurance, battery technology, and artificial intelligence innovations, which could have big potential.  But IMO the key is autonomy.  They have the most data, so they will probably be first to solve it.  If they do, there are huge profits.  It is possible they do not.  The stock price has been so high recently because a lot of people are betting that they will solve it within 5 years."
2021-05-19 12:30:35,stocks,"Personally, I would highly encourage you to do the math on what full autonomy would earn Tesla and what this would mean for their market cap.

* Estimate how many Tesla's you expect to be on the road in 2030. They are expecting 50% annual growth, with much higher growth in 2021 and 2022 and lower near the end of the decade.
* Estimate how many people will buy a FSD subscription if the software is truly autonomous and allows individuals and companies to deploy their Teslas as robotaxis for almost 1/10th the price of Uber/Lyft, as well as individual owners to get work done or watch a movie while they're driving.
* Multiply that number by $400 (conservative estimate for what an FSD subscription would cost per month when the software is perfect)
* Multiply that number by 12 for annual revenue
* Multiply that number by 0.9 for operating margins (almost pure margins)
* Multiply that number by 0.8 to get Net Income
* Multiply that number by a realistic PE multiple to get the Market Cap by 2030

I got to a market cap of $6,5T. Obviously this would only apply if they do solve full autonomy without anyone else solving it around the same time, but it goes to show how absolutely astronomic the market opportunity for autonomous driving software is."

So I was looking at Exon, or another oil company, they had a great dividend, something like 7%, but the company had basically been staircasing down the charts. What do you make of that? As in, I can buy it but it feels like it's stagnating, the SP is moving down, and the div is likely holding that steady to some extent. Are you loading up? Or are you simply hawking waiting for the dip. I am building a div part of my ISA to hold long, but I'm just not sure what to make of it, sure I can get 7% dividend, but that's no good if the shares are worthless (unless I have massive piles of money, which I don't 🤔).

*Lack of debt* is most certainly a moat. If you are a legacy automaker and cannot pivot efficiently, then that is a huge handicap. Every dollar spent to repay bondholders and to pay dividends to shareholders is a dollar not spent on EV and battery research.

> Tesla is going to lose market share. 

No one expects Tesla to maintain 80%+ market share for very long. Even ARK projects that Tesla will only be able to maintain about 25% of global market share in the long term. The point is that the EV sector will grow exponentially, so that anyone who survives the growth period will come out on top. I would rather Tesla be 25% of a $100 billion industry than to be 80% of a $100 million dollar industry. Just like the industrial revolution of the early 1900s, only maybe 3 EV manufacturers will survive and they will share all of the profits. Tesla will be one of them of course.

> And Ford has a new salesman.

Ford also announced that they are cutting production by half next quarter, whereas Tesla's sales increased YoY despite the chip shortage. It is also telling that I can find neither the price nor the range of the F-150 Lightning anywhere on the Internet. I guess you can buy the truck based on a picture of Joe Biden, but most consumers are going to want to know the price and range first and Tesla has every other automaker beat on these two fronts."
2021-05-19 12:43:55,stocks,"Yeah. But my point is that, generally, if you are relying on a third-party for something, and that third-party refuses or otherwise cannot deliver on their promises, then there is nothing you can do about it. You just have to tell your clients tough luck. That is why Tesla often gets compared to Apple. Because they control every aspect of the software and the hardware design of their products."
2021-05-19 17:06:38,stocks,"There are many reports available that show how Tesla's factories are more efficient than legacy automakers' factories, especially the ones that Tesla built from the start to be an EV factory like Shanghai and the ones they're building now.

Tesla's quality is also rapidly catching up to and surpassing legacy automakers' quality. Panel gaps will be a thing of the past with Giga Shanghai and Giga Texas."
2021-05-19 12:48:15,stocks,"> given there is no logical reason why Tesla should be valued at 540B asides for random EV hype

Once full autonomy and robotaxis become reality, it will be a $4-8T market opportunity. Part of Tesla's valuation is the believe that they will capture a large part of this market. If they don't manage that, I do agree that it will take a while for them to start generating a return vs the current stock price.

That said, they still have a serious opportunity to generate high margin software sales even if they don't solve full autonomy. For example, they already make about $1000-1500 per car from software sales and they haven't even launched their app store yet. Meanwhile VW is spending billions to build a software system that delayed the ID3 release and then forced them to recall all ID3s because of more software issues, while it's earning them $0.

As for their production growth, they've already secured the factories to grow to 3-5 million cars per year and they're doing it at a much lower cost per installed production capacity than other automakers. There's still some opportunity just in their production expertise. Things like the way their factories are built, their material scientists, stamping presses, etc."
2021-05-19 11:18:26,stocks,"Excellent info! I meant however, why the comparison to auto OEMs is a bad one. Unless the answer above is that, and then it just went straight over my head.

I work on a site with driverless cars on test. There's a car driving around site all day autonomously! Pretty awesome tbh. I think Tesla has a lot going for it, especially branding and ofc Elon has an effect. I think even if someone beat them to the punch it wouldn't take long for them to reverse engineer it and integrate it. 

But I like your points about the apps in cars. i hadn't really thought too far about what would come after I started sleeping on the way to work."
2021-05-19 12:35:19,stocks,"Hey thanks this is another super interesting comment. I will definitely start using this type of analysis going forward. That is an interesting way to view it, I kinda forgot about the typical moats that tech brings these days simply because once it's in place, dethroning the current king is a mighty hill. I wasn't thinking about it that way, but it certainly makes sense. And even if there is competition you can account for that to sOme extent (like you could reduce the estimates over time by a %)."
2021-05-19 19:25:09,stocks,"TSLA's capex growth is intermittent and generally lags that of its automotive industry peers, your charts show AMZN's capex spend growing linearly.

2021-05-19 16:54:48,stocks,Nice. I don't buy any SPAC before it merges nowadays. PLBY seems to be exception that proves the rule post merger lol
2021-05-19 14:57:47,stocks,"That will likely change as the market cycle shifts. Price movement will justify the narrative and I expect that to propel oil to triple digits within the next 18 months, which will be very beneficial for the underlying equities. That stigma won’t hold it back because we literally cannot go without it, institutional capital will come in and retail will always follow where big capital inflows are going. Markets are cyclical, always have been and always will be.

I get that, but don’t get up in the recency bias. As I mentioned above, oil will likely do very well going forward and Exxon stock price will recover accordingly. That 7% dividend will be very sustainable and you will get that share price appreciation on top of it, as well as it being a very reliable pick to play this bull market. If you are building a dividend portfolio, you can’t go wrong with Exxon in my opinion."

I think the OP is saying a comparison to Auto OEMS is a bad one because at the end of the day Tesla is not really just an ""Auto"" company.

The religious believers see Tesla's potential in autonomous driving yes, but also private home energy storage, commercial energy, and utility scale battery/energy generation and storage. 

The energy generation and storage market is vastly larger than the automobile market. Autos are chump change in comparison to energy."
2021-05-19 11:48:18,stocks,"Well, other auto OEMs are not really innovating in comparison and have no chance at ever being more valuable than Apple.  They are valued by quarterly profits.  Tesla is priced by future growth trajectory.  Tesla shorts often claim the PE is too high relative to other auto OEMs, which is quite silly, so we should not make the same mistake."
2021-05-19 12:41:25,stocks,"Jep, absolutely!"
2021-05-19 16:57:18,stocks,"Fair point, just don't want to miss out if the market wakes up before this merges. But FOMO is also what caused me to buy $HOL at $18 so maybe I should listen to you lol"
2021-05-19 15:05:07,stocks,"Yeah I mention it because my Bff picked up some low level work for an investor/trader. One of the things my friend was asked to do was compile a list of dividend stocks that had a high yield and 10+ years of increasing or keeping the dividend yield. (I assume because that's akin to saying these companies going forward will want to maintain that yield and aren't likely to simply chop the legs off it at a moment's notice). I am sure they then went and did further research on those results but I thought it an interesting thesis. 

The majority of that list was energy, mobile networks. I went back to check and the one I was thinking of wasn't a oil company (LUMN). But funnily enough, the list is actually recovering (ofc I then made a watchlist out of that entire div list 😉). So got my eye on a good few names. Any other oil companies other than Exxon you recommend a look into?"
2021-05-19 18:38:37,stocks,"They've been building EVs for only a few years, which requires a completely different infrastructure. On top of that, they don't build 90% of their ICE parts themselves, they need to import all of them.

If you think legacy automakers truly make more efficient factories than Tesla, you've done zero research."
2021-05-19 12:01:35,stocks,"Nice Ty, yeah this is what I thought they were saying. I just wanted to be sure, cheers for the extra clarification!"
2021-05-19 12:00:50,stocks,"Gotcha! Thanks for this. Appreciate the breakdowns. Had to Google OEM. But I think I understand. TSLA is basically a tech company not a auto company. Comparing the two is just not really feasible as the auto OEMS are based on sales, projected sales etc.. but TSLA is not just an auto manufacturer. Tlsa is more about the tech they will innovate, no one is buying AUDI or BMW expecting them to make major breakthroughs in tech, sure they expect EV cars, but they don't see it like a growth/speculative pick. Whereas people are buying TSLA almost not for the EV cars, but the disruptive tech that comes with that? Is that about right?"
2021-05-19 16:57:50,stocks,"I did that for GHVI, too. Lesson learned"
2021-05-19 15:22:02,stocks,"I would recommend looking into oil tankers and offshore oil drillers, precious metals related equities and uranium."
2021-05-19 12:35:05,stocks,"I'd say that sums it up perfectly!

I'd also want to add that autonomous driver in a geofenced environment is almost endlessly easier than solving full autonomy on a global scale. Don't get me wrong, it's still cool as fuck, but it's not nearly as big a market opportunity, which is why people think Tesla's opportunity in autonomy is so big. They're the only ones not using LIDAR and geofenced environments, but truly solving autonomy that would be scalable worldwide."
2021-05-19 15:27:26,stocks,"Thanks for taking the time to give me all this info. Greatly appreciated, absorbing and recalibrating the brain algo as we speak."
2021-05-19 12:36:08,stocks,"Can you expand? Geofenced? As in, true driverless Vs like railed driverless?"
2021-05-19 15:38:16,stocks,"Absolutely no problem, best of luck on your investment endeavors."
2021-05-19 12:40:53,stocks,"Sort of. Geofenced basically means that the entire area the car will operate needs to be pre-scanned by special scanning cars. It's basically creating a map of the environment where the car will be able to drive, and it won't be able to leave that area without someone taking over control.

It's a great option for cities for example, but it's not scalable across the entire planet, as you need to scan these areas frequently to make sure the map remains up to date."
2021-05-19 13:12:54,stocks,"Oh nice. I saw a 3D mapping car literally in my estate yesterday. Thanks for clarification, indeed that is not a scalable solution."
2021-05-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Best setup for getting info for investing / rading?

2021-05-19 06:28:11,stocks,"You don't need a setup for monitoring if you're investing.  If you're trading,  and have to ask this question, You are likely on a path to financial suicide.

We weren’t back to pre-pandemic environment. There’s really no reason for it to be trading higher than it ever had except for speculation.

Backing into a price objective via EBITDA is usually a clunky tool, but still -- that's a huge differential. What am I not getting? Even if we knocked 30% off the price objective EBITDA implies it's a stupidly straightforward $100 stock trading at 68 for literally no reason I can see.

Using FCF, we get a slightly different value because of the dividend but again the price target should be \~75. If we don't hold dividends against the company, it's 80 without breaking a sweat. What am I missing? Why we just letting this random investment bank walk around with a 20% haircut"

If people think prices will go up, they wait for prices to go down so they stop spending.  
If people thing prices are low, they buy.

Well if people don't buy, prices come down to meet the demand. If people still don't buy, (equilibrium GDP) and three quarters go by, we are now in a recession.

Normally if people save too long, companies have no capital to pay employees. People get let go and it spirals because people now just don't have the money to spend so they are still in saving mode."

It makes zero sense when you think about buying stocks as starting your own business. Is there any ceiling on how much you would invest into it, or get into debt to start it? Would you believe that it will always grow and recover?

2021-05-19 11:13:20,stocks,I use Schwab too. I will say they're better than most. I had fidelity too and that thing sucks haha.
2021-05-19 11:22:38,stocks,"I like Fidelity, FWIW. I love Schwab for being the only moral company other that Vanguard to have reasonably priced target date funds that don't charge you 1% a year to invest, and try to steer new investors to them for that reason."
2021-05-19 11:56:08,stocks,Fidelity app on tablets went down along with the coin exchanges. Its not just Schwab.

2021-05-19 13:57:27,stocks,Market is pretty much a romcom at the moment. Misunderstandings and some unnecessary drama around every corner
2021-05-19 13:32:40,stocks,"If they did at least the market would tank and get it over with, and then we could buy low, instead of this knife being slowly pushed into us week after week after week."

2021-05-19 17:19:26,stocks,"Not at all, their guidance is basically praying the NFL boost is so big they don't go bankrupt next year.

Like, yeah, I'm sure they'll be able to write out some notes and push off all the cash burning into 2023 -- but it's a nine year old company. There's a lot of mouths to feed. 

The IPO was to develop enough equity to take money from bag holders who bought post-IPO and give it to their elaborate money burning enterprise in back. Now the stock price is even better than they probably could've imagined, but the future is still the same. Write out some more debt against equity, good luck anyone getting their money back this side of 2024

As far as I'm concerned if DKNG is remotely making money in 2024 then they would've proven their own guidance wrong. In that case I'll buy their stock at $15 or $16 or whatever it is then. Maybe then they'll really moonshot. 

Worst case scenario they begin their moonshot in 2023 when their EBITDA hits ""only"" -10 and I'm marginally late to the ride. But if they're really going to moonshot in a haze of regulatory jizzing and cooming to some low margin gambling company, buying in 2024 would still be like getting into Amazon at 20$. No one got poor waiting for Amazon's non-GAAP measurables to get at least remotely profitable"
2021-05-19 09:26:21,stocks,It ain't over yet.
2021-05-19 09:32:05,stocks,When people are fearful they sell everything for cash. It’s indiscriminate. It’s why Amazon fell during March last year even though it was a golden goose for them.

2021-05-19 12:24:11,stocks,">Inflation is out of control  
  
no it isn't.  
  
>real unemployment is sky high  
  
What're you using for ""real unemployment""? U-6? Currently, U-6, which measures underemployment, is 10.4% and trending downwards. That's...where it was in 2015? And above 10.4% from July '08 until June '15. We've been above that for nearly an entire decade before.  
   
>stock valuations are completely bonkers trading several more times forward earnings than we historically have seen  
   
Huh? For some stocks, sure. Recent IPOs and memes like TSLA. But, could it simply be that companies are doing well? For example, nearly every one of the top 10 companies in the SP500 posted absolute monster years in 2020, record profits and revenue.   
   
> The market likes predictability, of which there is almost none present nowadays.  
  
The [VIX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EVIX/) exists to measure volatility, and while it's up 11% today, it's still down from a 52 week high of 36. Not like this is something we haven't seen.  
    
>it is a completely fair take to not see any end in sight  
  
You should take a deep breath and go outside, and I'm being honest. The CDC just removed the mask mandate for vaccinated persons. Unemployment is falling. Inflation, as of now, is exactly what we've expected. A short, transitory rise, followed by a flattening. We're in that rise right now, and it's not ""out of control"". We haven't even looked at raising interest rates as an option because we aren't concerned yet.  
   
There is absolutely an end in sight, this is a wild thing to say as a result of *checks notes* a 4% drop in the sp500 since an all-time high we literally hit on May 7 (which was just 12 days ago!!)  
   
We've had a -4% period over the course of 12 days, must be no end in sight!"

2021-05-19 14:01:25,stocks,"IMO massive fiscal stimulus in combination with QE (it's already been 3 times what it was to deal with the 2008 crisis) may have been a mistake.  Something needed to be done but in their rush to get things done I wonder if they overdid it.

I don't believe Biden himself is to blame as stimulus was also passed under Trump.  The Dems have done more, yeah, but the Republican plan of ""every man for himself"" isn't really the way either IMO.

The problem IMO is deeply structural (inequality, etc.) and the pandemic just brought that out.  Trying to fix it by throwing buckets of money at it without much rhyme or reason, and with questionable political motives, IMO was not the solution.

Ignoring it for questionable political motives wouldn't have been either.

We need real solutions but America doesn't look like it's ready for that, thus why it settled for Biden.  It's not a Dem or Republican problem, it's an establishment problem.  Scapegoating Biden is the easy way out, but then again, so is scapegoating Trump."

2021-05-19 14:02:51,stocks,"IMO, there is inflation and I think that the Fed is downplaying it a bit to ease fears. And I can't blame them. I don't believe the doomsayers saying we're headed for Weimar Republic---that's a bit extreme and if it were the case, we're sort of screwed no matter what we do. No point to brood over that remote idea.

As far as blame is concerned, to place it on any one person is short-sighted. Keep in mind that a majority of the COVID stimulus, if one wanted to point to that as the impetus for excess inflation, was rolled out by the *previous* administration. And, keep in mind also, that no one at the time seemed to have a problem with it, because we were dealing with the type of crisis that we haven't confronted in over a century. Assigning blame is silly and ignores the fact that the position we find ourselves in is a hole we've dug since the 2000's. If you're going to assign blame to administrations, you're going to have to blame Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden. Even so, I think that's silly. These men are not economists and it's not their jobs to be. Rates have been progressively cut over and over by the Fed to save this, that, the other, and now they're against the wall and something has to give."

A common misconception that science continues at the same pace. You can't just ""*buy*"" inventions. You can't ""order"" a new technology that hasn't yet been invented. The last century was a great leap in innovation, all the electronics and computers and all other great things. But we may have reached a plateau - it may be temporary, it may be long term, but it's obvious to everyone who isn't afraid to open their eyes that the speed of innovation has slowed down considerably.

US population growth is [all time low](https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Figure1.png) and is predicted to [continue to slow down](https://i1.wp.com/www.prb.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/article1-fig1@4x.png)

Immigration is not going to save US either as it's also [slowing down](https://i2.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20200111_BrookingsMetro_Dem-Recap-02.png) - and with recent US socioeconomical and political climate I can't see this trend reversing anytime soon."

That's not an axiom, but just a rule of thumb since *most people* can't and don't even try to time the market.

In a sense, DCA is really similar to a wide diversification - you have no idea when and where the market will go, so you just constantly buy no matter what is happening.    
Diversification - spreading out your investments across the whole market, since you have no clue which companies will go up and which will go down.    
DCA - spreading out your investments across the whole timeline, since you have no clue when the market will go up and when it will go down.

[Example graph](https://cms.trustnet.com/media/Default/Images/Graphs/20200928_outlook_on_uk_brovid_rp_1.png)

Another point: S&P 500 was created in 1957. Imagine saying that 64 years translates to some universal truth that will always be true.

Also, why is S&P 500 the strongest index? If you compare Nasdaq 100 with S&P 500 since the year Nasdaq 100 was created, even after the dot com crash the Nasdaq is certainly a much stronger index?

For example, I paid X amount of USD for Y amount of shares. After some time, I also receive Z amount of shares. By a specific formula of let's say 70%, such that Z = 0.7 \* Y

2021-05-19 16:09:09,stocks,"I don't understand. You gave the formula.    
You have y shares.    
You will receive 0.7z shares.    
You will keep y shares and also have 0.7z shares.    
    
If you had 100 shares of y you will end up with 100 shares of y and 70 shares of z.        
The y shares will drop in value as part of the company is divested.    
The z shares will probably be the difference in drop.    
e.g. if y was 100 before, you had 100 shares at 100 = 10,000 value.    
Y could be 30 after.    
But your 70 shares of z will be 100 each.    
So your total is 3,000 + 7,000 =10,000    
That's the theory. the market values both new companies and they could change rapidly.     
Z could be 99 after and y could be 1.2.     
You can see how much they're being spun off as in the details.     
Note that the details of this spin off are factored into stock price. So the historic stock price updates to reflect the drops or changes. I dunno how capital gains tax is considered in this respect"

1 - Learn about indexes and industries rather than individual companies. This will open up the world of index funds and ETFs.

2 - Learn about the big name blue chips. Now you're looking at the companies that you see around you in everyday life like Apple and Google. Fundamentally, these companies are rock solid but you'll need to keep an eye out to see if there are any changes that will make you want to sell your stake and move on.

3 - Start diving deeper and understand dividends and dividend aristocrats. You'll learn how to tie in the growth of the stock with the dividend yield/growth rate.  

4 - Now you're knowledgeable enough to get into fundamentals and understand how companies trade relative to fundamentals. This allows you to look for values in budding industries that you may not immediately be familiar with. Now you're starting to get into an advanced level.

5 - Next is technical analysis and charting.  This allows you to get into short term investing for quick profits. 

6 - Options and other alternative investments is next and that will allow you to also turn quick and big profits with more leverage."

I take out margin (2.5% interest) for $150k

I spend my original $150k on long hold and high dividend stocks - low volatility generally. I also have grown this $150k from around $75k in cash 4 years ago.

The margin $150k is put into a mix of:

1. Solid fundamental stocks I wouldn't mind holding for a long time
2. Meme stocks (GME mainly)

I buy shares in around 8-10 different companies with fairly high volatility in packs of 100

I sell covered calls expiring that week at the strike price 50c or $1 above the purchase price.

I take the premium and the options either go ITM or OTM

I've averaged about $2.5k per week so far doing this, I've been using 90% of my margin though and will be toning it down a bit in the future to just aim for $1500-$2k per week in premiums.

Tell me why this is stupid. 

Cheers"

With half of your portfolio on margin, that seems like picking pennies in front of a bulldozer."
2021-05-19 06:35:11,stocks,"How much cash do you have? It's interesting that you're holding meme stocks on margin and you're not worried about a margin call. Last I heard GME required a high percentage equity requirement for margin purchases vs the standard.

I'd double check the 30% theory of liquidation you have. Generally, using that much leverage will require a smaller drop to have to cover your positions. 

90% margin in this market is insane by the way."

OP is talking about using the margin for a very safe investment strategy with half ""on long hold and high dividend stocks - low volatility generally"".    The biggest risk is that the extra return will not be more than the interest rate.  The risk of ruin is minimal.  More people should use margin but they do not totally know how to manage risk."

Nucor is doing well because of steel prices and this probably will persist for the year, but when supply and demand normalize, so will many of these companies profits, as 2020 and 2021 this far seem to be outliers as far as earnings go, and moving forward the market will have different expectations. 

I am bullish on steel until after summer, after that, I will worry a bit more.

I am not so certain myself. Certainly there is more demand than say, 2 years ago but I also think the lost year was the reason why manufacturing didnt keep up. I think once they are back in gear, prices come back down and margins go back to normal along with valuations.

If something like that were to happen with steel I imagine it wouldn't be good. Although I find this unlikely, it's a possibility. 

Airplanes believe it or not I would short or sell, I would only hold southwest airlines, as only domestic flights in US are actually going to resume at a decent rate. With inflation happening as well, I'm not sure what I would do with airlines. People have wild expectations for these stocks but don't realize how indebted these companies are, american airlines is mired in debt, and has a pretty bad balance sheet to support their ridiculous rally. 

Restaurants and retail are dependant on an individual company basis as well. Certain companies have pricing power during inflation, some don't. Evaluate that, as it's only going to get more wobbly. But you're in the right place with industrials right now, I think it's rocky but my main conviction plays right now are oil, (similar concept to your steel) and financials with a touch of healthcare as a hedge for inflation.

I mainly buy shares and hold to invest, but oil I'm taking a swing approach and planning to sell most of my position when I reach my goal, and then hold the rest for long, that may be a good idea with your steel as well, as they are both ""commodities"" that are undergoing a massive cycle. 

I'm also buying call options a bit and selling puts on certain industrials like GE, because once travel resumes to 2019 levels, people will begin to realize how much more efficient that business is and the stock will appreciate greatly."

Same with my airlines which I've held for a while. At this point buying  airplanes people have missed the boat, but I still think there's some room to grow at least until early next year. The Holiday traffic should be massive post covid.

Agreed on restaurants and retail. Noticing my retail stocks are doing far better than restaurants, which sorta makes sense given the employee shortage needing more for fast food than retail per say (or having e commerce instead). 

I've been in oil with chevron and marathon for about 2 months and been basically flat this whole time through the ups nd downs. Annoying but holding.

Yes on GE! It's been on my watchlist, just looking for a good entry point. Currently in AGR which got approved for first major wind project in the US in Martha's Vineyard and they plan on using GE. Out of all the renewable green energy, I'd rather stick with big names like GE than unproven names."

I am reading that a market order will sell at whatever price it is that and it is the fastest do I also risk it possibly going down 20 or 30% or more with a market order?

I’m slightly in the positive so I would be okay doing a limit order at break even or a small loss.

If you set a limit sell, at say a 5% loss, and the stock opens 10% down, your stock won’t sell until the price rises to hit your limit—which it might not. 

Stocks are most volatile in the morning trading hours—9:30-to around 11:30. If you’re watching the stock and hanging on it’s every move, know that around lunch you’ll have a pretty good idea of where the stock will end up for the day. Though the last hour of trading, 3-4 can be just as volatile."

As more people pay to avoid ads, the populace that doesn’t pay is going to be generating much less revenue for FB than most expect. They’d likely need to charge much much more than $3/month for a payment model because you’re skimming off the most profitable users.

There is absolutely an equilibrium balance here, just that it will be difficult to find and FB probably doesn’t want to jeopardize their earnings in the process."

I usually go off analysts' price targeting, and company descriptions on specific drugs they're developing (i.e medications to treat rheumatoid arthritis, or oncological agents for specific cancers.)

However, it seems to me that there seems to be very little correlation to any specific variable and the underlying stock's performance. Sometimes, news of successful completion of a phase II study causes a huge rise in the stock. Other times, similar news would result in a 20+% dive in the stock.

Which I name only because 1) you deserve some sort of answer, and 2) they're already market-approved in the EU for Yselty (pending FDA approval in the US - meaning crucially that FDA trials have been completed). Imo women's health has been looong overlooked by global pharma.

Last thing to add is that you must realize your investment should start early and grow with the company, and could take years before seeing *the fabled biotech gains.* It's all about completing the FDA process and successfully getting your product to market.

I work in the industry and learned early on not to touch them. My highest conviction pick in the aforementioned groups is TMO - massive catalog spanning just about everything (like Walmart and Amazon, for certain things like chromatography though other brands like Agilent are way better - I think Agilent is also a good pick) and diversifying into the services industry. They also have a lot of innovation in mass spec (huge tech) and cryo em (not huge yet but growing). Thermo is basically THE industry giant and doesn’t seem to be slowing down."

With healthcare being a multi sided market. It’s difficult for companies to demonstrate value to all the entities involved. No one asks for X brand MRI.

And from my (chemist) perspective it's not very enticing, I'm usually looking for a moat in terms of field (ie women's health, mental health, penis drugs, etc) and/or novel technology. And although liquid aspirin is a novel technology I don't see a significant edge efficacy-wise over traditional aspirin...... unless you want to delve into the chaos world of healthcare, doctors, hospitals, and insurance.

So far, there are only three buys I regret:

3) INTC - This has turned out to be a surprise disappointment at this time. In my pre-entry research, Intel had a reputation for being a safe, reliable company that would continue to steadily climb. Unfortunately, after about two days of small gains, Intel has done nothing but tumble. Still, I’m optimistic for its long term because it’s Intel, so I’m holding it.

2) MRNA - Chalk this one up to bad luck. I bought Moderna to chase its earnings report, but the timing couldn’t have been worse: I got in literally MINUTES before the Biden administration announced that the US wouldn’t protect COVID vaccine patents. In a snap, MRNA tumbled 20 points, and to add insult to injury, its earnings report disappointed. Thankfully, it’s only 5 shares, but I’m stuck holding them until MRNA can climb back to 178 again.

1) TSLA - Chalk this one up to being a total n00b. I bought TSLA on my 5th day in the market. I only had enough for one share, but I had to have it. Tesla had been surging for two straight days, and it looked poised to surge again for a third. I was thinking “easy $15 at least.” It turns out I wound up buying it at its peak. Since then, my one share of TSLA has tumbled $200, and with its unpredictability, who knows what direction it’s headed in? My stubbornness refuses to cut this loss, and a balanced portfolio that is gaining more than losing is allowing me to hold this share with the blind belief that it’ll see 800 again."

2021-05-18 21:12:39,stocks,"Sadly Disney. However, you can absolutely chalk that one down to personal bias / also knowing it’s a safe long term bet. I’ve been telling my girlfriend and family it’s overvalued, and despite knowing that, I continued to buy it to average down way too early because they kept saying to ( we’re a big Disney world family! ) 

In a few years I think I’ll be just fine, however, I’m definitely slowing my buying for the next few months with Disney. It’s got potential to go up from its current price, however, it’s more likely to go down I feel than rebound to its prior price. So I’ll be buying, just less so than I would if the price were 150-160 right now. Ya feel? :0

My best advice would be to keep an eye on fair value estimates. They’re not gonna be right 100% of the time, nothing is, but it’s often ( when done by experts ) our best guess as to where a stock will trend, either up or down."

But a suitable story is how I bought $AMD at around $85 couple of months ago thinking it should reach $100 soon. Then $U dropped from $150 to $130 after the earnings call. To me the results of the call didn't look bad, and Ark also immediately bought the dip, so I sold half of $AMD at a loss in hope of $U's quick rebound. I still hold both positions, $AMD is barely $75 right now, $U is $90, overall I lost like 30% on this. Well, at least AMD is almost certain to recover after the merger"

Also did you look at Intels chart in your research? Not sure why you pegged it as stable growth given its recent history and standing in the semi conductor market. Plus it went straight down from 2000 to 2009, not exactly growth. It’s now been having swings of 15-20% multiple times in the last 4 years. I like intel but you might be betting on a bad horse, TBD. Back to being new in the market, you shouldn’t be trying to chase earnings plays, and there’s no reason you need be stuck with MRNA if you want out. Take the loss and move on, that’s what it sounds like you want to do. Or don’t, but stick to your plan as it’s much easier to have no regrets that way. 

As for TSLA, what gave you the impression it would surge for another day and why 15 dollars? If it was as easy as just saying wow it’s going up it’s “surging” I think I can make 15 dollars, we’d all be rich. Was there a catalyst? Increase in volume? Bouncing off the 200 MA or broke above a good resistance level? 

I don’t have any regrets yet, locked in some large losses early on this year but have since recovered. Some of my current holdings are not performing well, TSM is down, Pinterest is down, gave a bunch of unrealized gains back from AAPL pulling back. The markets been weird for two months, the day to day stuff with the fed, interest rates, then inflation, plus the market rotation, it’s nothing but noise.

I had a long hold on TGT which I sold out of when it started down in March. I should have had more faith, especially since I'd been holding for a while and had a nice low cost basis. I also out of some STOR for the same dumb reason. 

Some ""mistakes"" have been good. I got into semiconductors last year, and was able to recognize that they'd stopped outperforming, and exited, preserving some profits. So I feel I did a few things right, rather than riding everything down like I did during COVID."

OPBK collapsed from where I invested it undervalued. I pushed more money in for the higher dividend %.
MTB and JHG did the same thing. Kept pushing incremental amounts in and eventually they popped modestly above the book value price. Thing is I invested in these stocks when they were three quarters to a half under book value. Some of these stocks had a 0 debt to equity ratio and good underwriting, so I was none to worried.

CYTX was the worst buy and I invested in it to humor somebody. That somebody said, the recommendation I made to him, ""The Intelligent Investor"" strategy worked and I should stick to that.

Only crawled out of that hole recently sticking to the strategy strictly."

2021-05-19 02:55:03,stocks,"Before I would just hold broad ETFs and a few companies like AAPL but I got tired of feeling so out of control, so I became more active. One thing I hope i've learned is to recognize when the environment has changed, i.e. get out of software stocks and into something that's going up, like regional banks. 

Of course I'm down $25k today, so don't take any advice from me."
2021-05-19 14:33:20,stocks,I think RKT is amazing and a long term hold for sure. You may just have to hold a bit longer than most lol. But long term you will crush imo
2021-05-18 22:12:49,stocks,"PLTR for me as well, which sucks because I initially bought it on IPO day ($10.75 average, only to sell @ $13 and buy back at $27. Anyone can feel free to ask for my next moves if you want to inverse me."
2021-05-19 03:12:36,stocks,"I've been accumulating PLTR, because I initially had a cost basis of 30$ which I brought down to 24$ with 900 shares now"
2021-05-18 22:01:41,stocks,I feel so lucky I’m averaged into PLTR around $11. Sold a bunch when it hit its ATH but I’m still buying more with this current dip. Love it long term but feel for you guys who are averages around 24-28 or higher at the moment

2021-05-18 22:56:23,stocks,"Yeah it got burned pretty bad.  I got in at $3 a share, and watched it climb to 40.  

I was very tempted to sell at 40, but I had high hopes they would secure that contract.  

Weird being green on that stock.  I am gonna hold for years, and its not because I think it will bounce back, but because fuck it.  They may get lucky someday and really soar, but even if they go bankrupt, it was probably the best stock journey I ever had.  So I'm just gonna let it sit there until its either worthless, or hold onto it for the next 10 years just so I don't forget who they are and can watch what they do.  

It was fun while it lasted."
2021-05-19 06:17:48,stocks,have they not been doing pretty well recently? or did you buy in near the top?

2021-05-18 21:10:28,stocks,TTWO is far from a “worst buy”. Its a solid company and investment is for the long term
2021-05-18 21:20:18,stocks,I was convinced Etsy had to come back down. Got 185 puts on it. Rods it out til they expired worthless. Lost it all. Next week shit tanked form 220 to 165. Fml. Was debating rolling and said no cut my losses. Shoulda stuck my guns on that one ffs. Someday I’ll get lucky.
2021-05-19 11:21:39,stocks,Farfetch is a better bet than Etsy.

2021-05-19 11:32:09,stocks,"Bought it at 18, superbad decision hat will bit me in the ass superhard.
I now might as well hold and will probably do so for years to come.

Maybe I will sell some of it for tax reason at the en d of the year."
2021-05-19 00:11:14,stocks,"Big thanks for the honest critique. I bought into Intel mostly because of its name. My impression of Intel going in was that it was a strong company with a solid credibility in the processor industry. That likely clouded my judgment when I read its earnings reports and compared it to AMD’s. I was aware that Intel had lost some ground, but for me at the time, it was a temporary hiccup. After all, it’s Intel, the king of microprocessors; why can’t they recover? Maybe it’s that same clouded judgment that’s making me hold it for the long run (or maybe it’s because it pays dividends, unlike AMD and Nvidia).

As for Moderna, consider it a major lesson learned. I’d successfully chased earnings for four straight stocks prior to Moderna (flipped both ATVI and AAWW on the same day for more than a $200 profit), so I was very much hyped for its earnings to get me some quick cash. Well, now I’m stuck with it until it crawls back up to 178 again because my stubborn ass refused to sell at a loss.

As for Tesla, the only indication that it would surge for a third day was that it surged for two straight. As I said, chalk that failed chase attempt to complete lack of experience."
2021-05-19 09:50:11,stocks,"I bought T early on too. I’m so glad I dumped it for a gain a few weeks in. That stock looks poised to go nowhere fast, even with the recent good news."
2021-05-19 10:04:02,stocks,"No doubt. The safest investment is still a broad-based index fund, but let’s face it: most of us will continue to pick stocks for our own reasons. I know I do it because I actually believe in the individual company."
2021-05-19 11:14:22,stocks,I picked it up a little higher than you.  I'm considering buying more to average down.  Trying to gauge where the bottom is.
2021-05-19 14:25:08,stocks,TLRY. I'm ready to cave in and sell at 65% loss just because I hate seeing my stupid play.

2021-05-19 03:32:13,stocks,They’re probably down 7% because of their 10% dividend. Many stocks with dividends above 6-7% downtrend
2021-05-19 10:01:26,stocks,"We have to be. Otherwise, the market will wipe us out faster than an overhyped blockbuster flop."

2021-05-19 09:59:11,stocks,"You can’t. However, all we have to go on is what we see so far, since any prospective views aren’t guaranteed to be realized."
2021-05-19 10:08:02,stocks,"I was just starting, and in my research at the time (which wasn’t as thorough as I research now), TSLA was listed by a ton of business sources as a stock that was suitable for a beginner’s portfolio. Then came the surge literally days in. You can understand how someone with so little experience could easily buy into the hype. Thankfully, I was saved by the fact that I only had enough for one share; otherwise, my portfolio would probably be doused in gasoline by now just waiting for someone to light a match."
2021-05-19 10:57:08,stocks,Not having enough money saved me from an even bigger loss
2021-05-19 12:13:26,stocks,Sounds like you just bought at the wrong time lol

2021-05-19 15:20:30,stocks,"I refuse to sell. These leaps made up over 50% of my portfolio so to just eat the loss would of been too devastating. Instead, I decided to risk it all and double the fuck down lol. I sold every single position that I was still profitable in such as Apple, Salesforce, ect. I then used the money to purchase as many deep ITM NIO leaps as I could in order to bring my breakeven and average strike down. I snagged a 15c, 17c, and two 25c all expiring the same date as my original bleeding leaps (Jan 2023). 

I now have 90% of my portfolio in NIO which is absolutely insane but I was able to bring my breakeven price from $74 to under $55 which allows me to sleep a bit better lol."

2021-05-19 18:05:53,stocks,"Yes, but my margin of safety is terrible.. But I am not too worry since I will hold it for a really long time. But it could easily drop a lot, since many stocks are very overpriced right now, compared to their historical PE."
2021-05-19 12:46:05,stocks,"You think it's not gonna go up till the end of the year? I think maybe few months and we start to climb steadily, because they are announcing all those partnerships, the price shouldn't be as low as it is now, or should it?"
2021-05-19 01:41:35,stocks,"No problem! I just think one month is far to short of a time frame to try and really label winners or losers for any position, let alone long positions you picked while being fresh to the market. You're not day trading these picks, you think they could recover (and they may. I have hope, I like intel) but surely you didn't expect that to happen within a month, so why the regret? Why are you labeling it a loser at this point?  It's been a month in a weird market, let things play out a little bit. The comeback could be years in the making if Intel is able to pull it off, plus they do have a dividend as you note.

Did you just guess those companies would have good earnings? Or what made you play those as earnings plays? Considering even good earnings have resulted in sell offs and things being ""priced in"" if you will, it seems like a tough thing to try and do consistently. If that's what you want to do, do it, but since the trade didn't work out, why hold it? Being stubborn is just tying your money up. Now I'm not saying to take the loss, but think about what you want to do, and that play in particular. If you want to trade earnings plays, are you going to hold every one that tanks because you're stubborn? You'll run out of free capital fast. Don't let your emotions change your trade plan. If your plan was ""I'm buying and its going to go up after earnings"" then you should add some more depth to your plan, imo. Now if you want to hold Moderna because its a good stock or it balances your portfolio out, great. Again I'm not saying hold Intel, or sell Moderna, but to just look at what you're doing and why. Stick to your trade plan/thesis.

>As for Tesla, the only indication that it would surge for a third daywas that it surged for two straight. As I said, chalk that failed chaseattempt to complete lack of experience.

If it was that easy, we'd both be sipping margaritas in margaritaville..or whatever it is rich people do, ha.  There are some things on a chart that are basic and mathematical that make a lot of sense. I'm personally not into some of the crazy astrology stuff like the triple flying rocket mutated doge seaweed pattern, but things like volume, moving averages, and basic support and resistance can go a long long ways in identifying why things might be surging when pairing that information with outside catalysts. Hopefully the market calms down and your plays turn around. You're off to a great start, good luck!"
2021-05-19 14:54:53,stocks,Yea I’ll just hold it and buy some more if they come out with something nice further down the line I guess
2021-05-19 10:08:43,stocks,"Lots of people who believe in lots of companies are getting nuked right now.

Products like Bloomberg and Eikon can not just give you this data anymore, then serve merely as a conduit to let you purchase it from the vendors.

A lot of sites have $FEYE at $27 in the next 12 months. So my question is at what point between $20.50 and $27 ( hopefully) should I sell some of my shares?

I'm new to investing in stocks, and would really appreciate your help.

I keep hearing how the current market is likely to be overvalued and all signs are pointing to a bubble. Analysts are warning it could be worse DotCom bubble, etc, with companies propped up on stimulus money despite the troubles of Covid. Apparently Warren Buffet and others have all suggested we will soon see a bear market, but it's impossible to know whether that will be next week or 2030.

With that in mind, my current strategy is value investing for a 1 to 2 year window. I'm looking for massively undervalued stocks (currently my main pick is VIAC) and putting my money there, with the idea that they will outperform the indexes when the dip happens in future.

After the dip, I'd love to go long-term and buy the SNP, chuck in some AAPL and MSFT and some electric car ETFs, but I'm worried if I do that now the arse will fall out of this thing and I'll be left buying at the top of a collapsed market.

One good piece of advice I can give is that the best investors are the best observers of the economy and the needs of people/needs in general. Personally, I think that lots of the sectors I mentioned above, also including tech companies, will be around because it is most likely the future. But it's up to you to decide, this was my own conclusion.

 Will solar continue to grow, and get cheaper and more efficient? Most likely, that's a good investment(depending on the company of course). Will Gene editing have some insane benefits and will it grow and scale? I believe so. How about electric vehicles? You get the idea? There's also lots of other sectors out there that are undervalued, not just what I mentioned. Check out one of my favorite stocks rn, APPH or Appharvest.

2021-05-19 00:46:37,stocks,"I agree there's a lot of pump and dump chatter out there. But there's a lot of bullshit about most stocks all the time, the only thing that matters to me is the actual discussion about value.

For most of the last 5 years it was trading between $48ish and $68ish. Now it has a new business strategy (convert traditional cable audience to DTC streaming). It's currently achieving that target (beat earnings and added 6M new subscribers to its rebranded streaming service Paramount+ in the last quarter).

It's currently trading at $40. Even if it recovers to $50 that's a nice 25% bump. If you're a bull and it goes to $60 that's a 50% bump. Downside risk is low as the PE is tiny compared to the rest of the market (VIAC is 8.8, Discovery is 22, Netflix is 58).

Sure, they're no Netflix. But they make a lot of original content, and content is king. The streaming market as a whole is massive and growing. Expected to increase something like 20% a year worldwide for the next decade. So I see this as a great opportunity to get in the streaming market at the cheapest possible value, with a good opportunity for return.

Long story short, yes there's a lot of Reddit fuckwits trying to pump and dump it, but ignore that bullshit. It's just noise. Buy shares, not options. They'll sell up and leave, leaving behind a great 2 year value play.

I'm a fan of semiconductor plays like , QCOM, Lam research, AMD and intel (long hold, short is hairy.) I like big tech with good earnings and decently low peg and pe multiples. Tech is presenting some good buying opportunities, but the market is rampant with companies that just simply won't make it. Stick to blues chip names that have gotten beaten up and dca into a solid position. Anything else speculative, may be comparable to catching a falling knife.

Apph isn't terrible and has promise. 

EV is solid, but very expensive for most investments right now, as most don't turn a profit. Tesla barely even turns a profit and is the first mover. To play this space, I would go with legacy automakers like Gm or ford or volkswagen, as they are on a path to integrate EVs into their lineups. 

Other than automakers, I would buy lithium miners like Livent or albemarle. Precious metals like palladium and rhodium related stocks may also be good buys because PGM metals are used in EV cars as well as ICE cars. 

Right now, industrials are good, although with the inflation narrative, stocks with pricing power are in demand. Healthcare, tobacco, oil (eh, I'm bullish, but I'm biased), food and beverage (pepsi, Coca-Cola, etc) will probably do decent under this volatility, but won't make you heaps of money either. 

Banks are also decent buys, I like Citi and BAC. They will do well under inflation BUT have already went on a bit of a tear so dca into a position may be smart."
2021-05-19 03:36:31,stocks,"Listen to this guy, OP. He gets it."
2021-05-19 12:58:05,stocks,"Well, I typically don't buy something after it's gone up for months straight. 'Losing spree' might be how you see it but I see buying opportunities. Nothing you said has any merit towards the argument that anything I said is a bad investment. Your argument is just, stocks are going down and nows not the time. 

I'm long term, 10-20 years. Today, tomorrow, next year, none of that matters, and it really shouldn't matter to OP either as he clearly has long term outlook. Also, I'm much more diversified than just tech. Sounds like you're mostly in tech. I'm unsure what's to be careful about what I said. I advised him to do research and gave some areas to look at, specifically areas that are presenting amazing buying opportunities right now. Again, I see opportunity, not loss.

Are you trying to tell me there's no future in genomics, solar, EV, robotics, agriculture, renewables, tech etc? If you're trying to make that argument, sorry it's not there. Otherwise, I really don't get what you're saying. Semiconductors are a huge rave rn, again I don't wanna chase money, I wanna beat it. You say this isn't the 'cycle' for my picks, I say in 10 years from now I'll be glad I invested my money where I did."
2021-05-19 14:13:04,stocks,"I'm not at all in tech at all, I have lam research and amd. That's it. I have 10% max , other than that I'm in banks, chemicals, oil. I'm a value investor, the stocks you pointed out are being oversold for a reason. Alot of them will not have a future."
2021-05-19 16:14:34,stocks,"I mentioned 1 stock, and sectors. ""Alot of them will not have a future."" Is a non-argument. Any reasons? Most likely not, because what I mentioned IS the future. And you even said APPH isn't bad lmao. But you saying the 'stocks I mentioned' tells me that's coming straight from your ass, because I didn't.

""the stocks you pointed out are being oversold for a reason. Alot of them will not have a future."" I don't think you're thinking through what you're saying. Also I didn't mention stocks I mentioned sectors. Do you have even 1 reason to believe genomics won't have a future? Or solar energy? What about electric vehicles? Data? Robotics? And if you truly believe that, then do some research and get with the times is what I'd advise. 

Telling someone not to invest in a stock just because it's down for the day/week/month again is a terrible, terrible non-argument. They're correcting from their bloated highs, not sinking ship. Yeah, 4 months ago wasn't the time to buy solar. Today is."
2021-05-19 16:31:41,stocks,"Yes, but market cycles are something to consider regardless of the companies behind the stocks, sometimes it's better to wait for companies to prove earnings, and I was mainly referencing EV stocks, my mistake. It's a speculative space with a lot of competition. Also genomics is one that i had owned at points, but the consensus from research I've done is that genomics is still far away from being used practically. There is nothing wrong with owning these stocks now, but it's just not where the money will flow, and as a beginner investor, it can be very hard to watch your good stocks get hammered in times like these. 

I do believe that the things you've mentioned 100% have a future, but there are so many companies and stocks that just won't make it in those spaces, to invest in things like EV or solar or robotics, I would stick to ETFs until there are clear winners in the space, and then I would pick stocks based on those results. I understand your frustrations, but I've been in this game a while and timing isn't everything for the long, the last thing you want to do is try and time a bottom for a falling knife. I prefer to play those spaces safely, ex, instead of buying EV stocks that are overvalued still, buy the lithium miners, which will benefit from the entire movement. 

You're timeline is appropriate for what you hold, but many beginners that started in the past year have had a hard time learning the lessons that no matter the greatness of a company, the stock may not be priced correctly or have good investor sentiment based on the numbers and earnings. Also inflation is a very real risk to a lot of speculative companies. I was trying to give OP a safe way to play as to not dissuade him from playing the market if he were to pick speculative stocks and lose money. I know if you're long long term, it's less of a worry, but everybody says that until they're down 50% and don't know what to do. 

Sorry for the misunderstandings, I don't intend to argue. Everybodies timeline and investment styles are different, I just found that yours is riskier short to medium term and is probably not the best for a beginner, even though I have a feeling you are a beginner. The goal is to not lose money I thought, and that's the guidance I was trying to give to OP instead of, catch falling knives and wait 10 years for recoveries. I was explaining the market cycle and environment we are currently in. But you seem to know all about it."

You have to look at the prospectus and holdings of every ETF to know what it's really dealing in. Many are a little misleading.

For instance, PAVE calls itself an infrastructure ETF, but includes a bunch of railroad operators. Infrastructure to them is a cost and the thing they operate, not what they generate as a business. They're transport companies, so putting them in a builders group is mixing up concepts.

And some ETFs keep a big chunk of their NAV in cash-valued investments like money markets or bond funds."
2021-05-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Oatly May Go Public on Thursday, May 20th Under Ticker 'OTLY' I tried looking for anything I could find but I found no confirmation, but I found several sources saying it ""is expected to take place on Thursday 20 May 2021"". It seems to be very under the radar.

Here's some info I found(from forex.com):

## What is Oatly?

Oatly is a Swedish vegan milk maker, producing a sustainable alternative to dairy products using oats. It was formed in the 1990s following research from Lund University, which led Oatly to patent its enzyme technology that turns oats into a milk substitute.

## When is the Oatly IPO?

Oatly’s [IPO](https://www.forex.com/en/market-analysis/latest-research/what-is-an-ipo/) is expected to take place on Thursday 20 May 2021, listing its shares under 'OTLY' on Nasdaq. Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Credit Suisse are the underwriters.

The company Oatly announced on Tuesday 23 February that it had submitted a confidential filing for an IPO with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The offering is expected to take place following the SEC’s review, depending on market conditions.

Oatly’s IPO would raise money to fund growth, as well as a chance for existing investors to cash in on their holdings.

\-------------------------------------------------------

The article goes on to talk about Oatly's valuation, revenue streams, competitors etc. Anyone in here interested? I typically don't know exactly how to value food product companies, so I'll stay on the sidelines personally but I've been waiting for this to IPO.

Would love to hear some discussion about your guys' opinions on this company and whether or not you think $10 billion is a fair valuation, and if you'll be buying on thursday/friday!"
2021-05-18 20:27:12,stocks,"Way overpriced imo. Its not such a difficult/unique product that it wont be replicated or improved by another company for cheaper. 

I'm guessing this will be another one that opens high and tanks in price before stabilizing after a few days or weeks.

Beyond had a lot of R&D behind it. Oatly is oatmilk..."
2021-05-18 20:29:05,stocks,"People underate Oatly’s brand strength, the comparison to Beyond Meat in the comments aren’t apt. Beyond Meat has a lot of media hype, but ultimately offers a lot of products that don’t sell particularly well. Their one product has more grocery revenue than every single thing Beyond Meat sells combined.

Also Oatly has developed a pretty strong moat for a retail food product as well, and has tons of room to grow in North America, and that growth is almost certain.

Oatly *right now* is a better food tech business than Beyond, the real question is that we don’t really have a good example on what public single-product food companies even look like, so you’d figure there would be real volatility and possibly of a huge value loss if Oat milk decreases in popularity."
2021-05-18 20:48:59,stocks,"I don't know if it's a completely accurate source, but I generally track new listings on IPO Scoop.  [This link](https://www.iposcoop.com/ipo-calendar/) shows the following information for Oatly:

* IPO:  Thursday 5/20/21
* Price per share:  $15-17
* Shares:  84.4 million
* Estimated volume:  $1.35 billion (which probably aligns with the $10 billion valuation)

Again, who knows whether any of that is completely accurate, but the site is usually pretty reliable.

As for the company, I can see it doing well, over time.  If nothing else, Oprah is a backer, and that never seems to hurt the prospects of a business.  I would be surprised if it became an overnight sensation, but slow/steady growth seems reasonable, given the trajectory of plant-based products.  Full disclosure:  I have had a plant-based diet for 9 years, so I am bullish on the concept.  However, I agree with prior commentary here insofar as $10 billion for a milk company seems somewhat bloated.

In that same space, there is a company called SunOpta ($STKL).  They are a large producer of soy/almond/oat milks.  Some products are delivered under their own labels; others are created for private labels (i.e., they make the stuff that CostCo sells under its ""Kirkland"" brand).  Currently, SunOpta has a $1.33 billion market cap.  So, there might be more room to run, when contrasted with a $10 billion valuation.  Plus, SunOpta appears to have some diversified revenue streams, which can be a nice feature.

That all being said, I don't hold any position in the company, so I'm not super knowledgeable about any granular details.  If intrigued, you should definitely look into it yourself.  Nevertheless, I wanted to pass along this limited information, in case it was helpful to the discussion."

The dairy companies are now targeting Oatly in their advertising with slogans like ""only cow's milk is real milk"" because they are losing so many costumers to them.

That being said. None of this matters if it can't perform well globally. I'm a bit skeptical that switching to vegan alternatives is going to be as popular in for example, the US. Also, who's to say we won't see a new competitor, with an even cheaper product, take over the market?"

On the other hand, packaged food and drink companies can command wild multiples even in this market, it seems. Look no further than $SAM or $CELH.

2021-05-18 22:15:19,stocks,"Extended unsustainable low-interest rates are a major factor. Low-interest rate means people can get a mortgage on a more expensive house. The major issue with that is the more expensive house ends up being the same house they would have ended up with at a higher rate.

In the end, they save no money on the mortgage. However, this does cause a jump in home prices. Honestly, buyers would be better off with a higher interest rate. Especially if they have a lot of cash on hand or can pay the mortgage off early. 

Low interest rates really benefit the seller, not the buyer. If you want to buy a house you should be hoping interest rates go up. Unless you have no cash and would never consider paying your loan off early. In which case it probably does not matter one way or the other."

Buying RE now seems like buying the top to me. I was in the market for a house before Covid. When RE prices went crazy I decided to rent for a while longer. I did the same thing during the the last recession and sold for a nice profit a few years later. Plan to do the same thing again this time. When markets are this hot, a major correction is almost certainly around the corner. 20-30% price increases on RE in 1 year is not healthy growth. The correction will come. Be patient - it’ll probably be here sooner than you think."
2021-05-18 22:55:58,stocks,"What you would save on the house over a 30-year mortgage due to having a lower interest rate gets added to the price of the home.

Say a drop in interest makes it where the home ends up being 40,000 cheaper over the course of the 30-year loan. 

The 40,000 basically gets added to the sticker price of the home. So the house is now going to be 40,000 more expensive. 

But not quite because you would also be paying interest on the extra 40,000 too. So maybe you end up paying 35,000 more for the house and the other 5,000 would be interest on the 35,000. 

The issue is people like to max out what they can borrow. Lower interest means they can borrow more so they will pay more. The only thing stopping them from paying say 40,000 more is they can't borrow 40,000 more. When the bank says yeah you can have 40,000 more because of the lower interest. They spend 40,000 more. 

When the bank says now you can borrow 40,000 less because of higher interest. They spend 40,000 less. 

 Since you will be competing with these people you will have to spend 40,000 more if they can borrow it. 

Or you can spend 40,000 less if they can't borrow it."

2021-05-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, May 18, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 18, 2021**

Stocks held steady today, with the three major indexes trading within a 0.5% range of the even line. It’s encouraging to see the market holding steady after the volatility experienced in the last few weeks. As I have said before, I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, where technology stocks sank and the S&P 500 (SPY) fell 4%, was overblown for a few reasons that will be explained below. 

Last week, the market tumbled in the largest loss since February after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the April Consumer and Producer Price indexes, which showed a larger increase than expected.  The CPI, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

The PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year.

While it’s difficult to pinpoint exact causes, there seem to be several factors contributing to the rise in inflation, none of which I think pose a significant threat to the sustainability of the current bull market.  First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. 

Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. As basic economics shows us, when demand begins to outstrip production capabilities (aka supply), prices inevitably go up. One prominent example of this you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. 

Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt—incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs—recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, “Given the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying “Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.

Now that we understand why inflation may be rising, these are the reasons I think fears are overblown. With the US economy reopening, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Moreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

**Highlights**

* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fourth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. 
* In a Ford factory in Michigan, President Biden promoted his $174 billion plan to promote and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles across the United States and planned to roll-back vehicle emission standards. According to the fact sheet, Biden's plan ""proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States” and backs grants to fund the retooling of shuttered factories ""to build advanced vehicles and parts.""
* Michael Burry, the investor famous for calling the 2008 housing market bubble and portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie “The Big Short”, recently unveiled a huge bearish bet on Tesla. Scion Asset Management, Burry’s firm, said in a regulatory filing it had put options on 800,100 shares of Tesla, as of the end of Quarter 1, a value of $534 million. Details on the strike price of the puts, their value and whether they are part of a broader trade are not publicly available. 
* Square (SQ), one of the leading fintech companies, launched services in Ireland, it’s first foray into the Eurozone as the company looks to expand beyond the US.
* Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has sold nearly all of its Wells Fargo (WFC) stock, a position the company has held since 1989. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire said it owned just $26.4 million of shares of WFC as of March 31, down from around $32 billion in January 2018.

2021-05-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Details behind AT&T’s debt (cross posted) The article in NYT outlines why ATT has all this horrible debt. Sounds like incompetence. All three deals were failures. And take a look at that last paragraph below. They spent over $150M just in advisory fees in 3 years to end up where they were to begin with but with more debt.  “After all of that deal-making, ATT is sitting on more than $170 billion in debt. As part of the deal with Discovery, ATT will get $43 billion to help reduce its debt load. (The spun-off media business will begin its independent life with $58 billion in debt.)”

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/18/business/ATT-WarnerMedia-Discovery.html?referringSource=articleShare


The DealBook newsletter explains how ATT got here, in three key deals:

1..A $39 billion bid to buy T-Mobile. After regulatory pushback, in 2011 ATT walked away from an effort to become the country’s largest wireless company. T-Mobile paired up instead with Sprint, and the two went on to buy huge amounts of spectrum in the high-stakes battle for 5G, leaving ATT behind as it lobbies regulators to step in. The failed deal hit ATT with a $3 billion dollar breakup fee, at the time the largest ever.

2.  The $67 billion acquisition of DirectTV. In 2015, ATT bet on cable TV as a way to amass customers whom it could eventually convert to streaming. But DirectTV bled subscribers as customers cut the cord, and ATT unloaded a stake in the company last year to TPG that valued DirectTV at about a third of its acquisition price. The deal also cost ATT about $50 million in advisory fees, according to Refinitiv.

3.  The $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. In 2018, Mr. Stephenson called the deal a “perfect match,” but the combined group struggled to invest in its telecom business while also spending enough to compete with the entertainment specialists at Netflix and Disney. Three years later, ATT is now spinning off the company so it can (re)focus on its quest for 5G market share. ATT paid $94 million in advisory fees to put the two companies together and an estimated $61 million to split them apart."

2021-05-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Things I wish people had told me when I started investing This is original content copied from my other post as this community doesn’t allow cross posts but is an equally good home for it.

I’ve been doing really well and I feel like sharing my thoughts for anyone interested. These are the things I wish I had known which would have saved me a lot of setbacks.

Ignore the charts. Don’t even look at them when making a decision. Regardless of what anyone says. A chart will only tell you what has happened so far. It will never tell you what will happen next. There is one exception to this I have found but I will bring that up at the very end of this post.

Use critical thinking for any single piece of information you read about a company or the market. Who published it and why? I haven’t yet found (and probably never will find) a single news article or post with neutral information on a company. And it’s never going to happen. In the stock market there are many different players and they all have different motives. Don’t trust what a Reddit investor tells you. But also don’t trust what CNN or CNBC tell you. There is something called “bias” and you have to be able to adjust the weight you give to any information you receive based on how biased the information is or might be. Any time you get information check multiple sources. Never rely on one single source. Or even one single type of source. If you only trust major news outlets you will be mislead or worse be behind the curve. If you only trust what investing forums say you are likely to run into people who are bagholding and trying to pump the stock to be able to dump it for a higher price before it keeps tanking. The truth is somewhere in the middle. Do your own research and don’t hesitate to use Google’s “past 24 hour” search filter to make sure you’re getting the latest information.

Stay open to criticism. If you have a good idea but someone knows better, it’s not just a learning experience but it can save you from losing your money. However, only take criticism seriously if someone can properly articulate their point and isn’t just spouting catchphrases or being an asshole.

Dollar cost averaging. It’s better to make several buys into a stock than one giant buy. It’s impossible to perfectly time the market. But you will almost always get a better entry point by averaging than by throwing down all the chips on the first move.

Always do your own due diligence. If you can’t write a thesis explaining why you’re making an investment (that’s not only convincing but free of confirmation bias) then you probably shouldn’t invest. Don’t just research the company, research the market the company is in. If the company is poised to do well and corner the market but there isn’t much of a market in general then there is no future for the company. In addition, research the “target audience” not for the company but for the shares themselves. What type of investors are buying shares? Are they the opportunistic kind? Are they buying just for a quick profit to scalp before they dump the stock into oblivion, or are they buying because they see a future for the company and plan a long term hold? This can be true of institutional investors as well as retail. It’s a better sign (for now anyway) when a happy whale like Cathie buys shares banking on the future of a company than if a super-predator like Chamath is buying them for a quick flip. Always keep other investors in mind when you make a decision. Investors are the consumer that drives the price of a share.

Buy the dip but only if you have a good reason to! Don’t blindly buy every dip. I see that pushed too often on Reddit. Buying a dip is good if a company is on an upwards trend and the dip occurred randomly. Do NOT buy the dip if it’s part of a larger downtrend or if it’s possibly due to an overall change in sentiment. Worst case scenario you will multiply your loss and best case scenario you will tie up further capital on a loser which results in decreased ammunition if you suddenly find a winner. Your $500 you could have used to buy a gainer will now be $300 you can use to buy another stock.

Don’t ever hesitate to cut your losses. If a company is in a downwards trend and it looks like they will be for a while (and there is no catalyst around the corner) cut the loss. Put your money in a better place. But keep watching the ticker. You can always buy back in when the sentiment turns positive. Keep a watchlist of stocks that look promising but don’t make it so big that you lose oversight and don’t make it so small that you’re missing too many opportunities.

Gauge your performance by your method and not by your gains and losses. If you’re up 100%, be honest with yourself. Are you up because you got lucky or because you have a solid strategy? If you’re down 40%, was it because of unpredictable factors or was it your own fault because you bought due to fear of missing out which clouded your thinking? Never beat yourself up. Learn from every move you make. Remember it’s impossible to perfectly time anything. If you sold and secured a 10% gain but it could have been 15%, that’s normal. You’re never going to catch the top of a spike or the bottom of a dip. That’s like waiting in the ocean for the perfect wave. It won’t happen and you’ll drown unless you’ve learned to surf when the wave gets to you. Same with buying. Most of the time when you buy, the stock will move down. I’ve lost a small percentage at the start of almost all my well planned and well timed moves. I kept holding and the losses turned into significant gains.

Manage risk and reward. The higher the risk, the lower percentage of your profile you should put into it. Be psychologically prepared to lose everything. The more you’re willing to live with that possibility, the more you’re going to be able to keep a cool mind when taking a calculated risk.

Never stop learning. The more you know, the more of an edge you have. Get in the habit of reading several articles per day. Focus on your existing investments so you can learn how what type of news affects the markets in which ways.

Never stop looking for opportunities. They don’t come to you. You have to find them like a needle in a haystack or a diamond in the rough. You’ll get much better at finding them with time. If you don’t get good at looking for opportunities and evaluating them then you won’t have any opportunities.

Never buy in to hype. The more hyped a stock is, the more likely it is that it will tank later. Even if you find a promising company for a good long term investment, wait until the hype dies down and the share price goes down. Otherwise you’ll start your investment with a slow and steady loss.

Shares are priced based on supply and demand. There are bids and there are asks. The higher the demand is on shares the higher the bids will be. The lower the demand is on a share the lower the bids will be. What this means is that when there is more buying pressure than selling pressure the cost of a share goes up. When there is more selling pressure than buying pressure the cost of a share goes down. In fact, that is all a chart will really tell you. Think of a chart as a historical look at past buying and selling pressure. Nothing more and nothing less. The price direction is determined only by buying and selling pressure.

The value of a share is subjective. You can run any equation you want to but there is no equation which links any of the variables of a company to the price of a share. There are many different ways to “value” stocks. DDM, DCF, price to earnings, price to book, enterprise value to EBIDTA, Technicals...and they all mean nothing. Why? Because the value of a share is what people are willing to pay for it. A stock is no different than a consumer good. Take, for example, iPhone. If you compare the iPhone 12 to android phones with similar specs the iPhone 12 price tag more than doubles some lesser known brands with the same specs. But people are willing to pay more for the iPhone. So the iPhone costs more. The value of a share is the same. If people are willing to pay more for a share of a company then those shares will cost more even if there is no mathematically verifiable reason.

There is no formula based on the specs of a phone which will predict what the retail cost of the device will be. Just like there is no formula which will take any company metrics into account and determine the price of a share.

Stocks go up and stocks go down. Everyone hates red days. But they’re normal and they’re not a sign you’re doing something wrong. They mostly move when there are catalysts that have either positive or negative effects on sentiment. The rest of the time they will trade sideways or slightly downwards. As long as the slope isn’t steep and there have been no bad news about the company having a red day is fine. In fact if a stock was only green all the time I would probably sell it because that could be a good sign it’s in a bubble and bubbles are known for bursting.

The biggest gains and losses in the market are driven by the biggest changes in investor sentiment. And investor sentiment isn’t rational. It’s irrational. For example there could be some slight bad news about a company which will have no bearing on the bottom line (for example a brief delay in a crucial step) which hits a nerve and causes an emotional overreaction which causes the stock to tank. Or there could be some neutral news about a company which investors mistakenly perceive as positive causing the stock to skyrocket.

Catalysts don’t matter. People’s reactions to the catalysts matter. If you look into a company that has upcoming catalysts, don’t focus on how the catalysts will effect the bottom line for the company. Focus on how the catalysts will impact investor sentiment. For example, if a company decides to increase the cost of a pharmaceutical product and they are now going to make 12 billion more dollars over the next 5 years, that’s great for the company. But if people are upset and there is bad publicity like “My mother died because she couldn’t afford her diabetes medication after the price hike.” then the value of a share will go down.

The biggest gains are in speculative investing but they also carry the highest risk. The reason that speculation has the biggest potential for gains is strictly due to human psychology. Investors are going to be a lot more fearful to invest in a company which isn’t generating revenue or where the future of a company has no proven results to back it up. Even if that company is going to cure cancer. But that’s also why there is the potential for a huge reward. If you can find a company investors are fearful to invest in now and you have enough data about the company to conclude that they are going to be successful, then you can actually turn a speculation into a somewhat more secure investment. 

For example, if a company announces that they found a cure for alzheimer’s. And you just happen to be a neuroscientist. If you understand the science and you instantly realize that they have a disruptive breakthrough, you can now use that to your advantage. You can invest in the company now with the knowledge that the science is solid. This gives you an edge. You know that you know the company will be a success. But you also know that anyone who isn’t a neuroscientist will have little faith in the company. As a result, you have now found a company which is setup for a massive change in sentiment. So you buy 10,000 shares for $0.03. Eventually, the company moves through to phase 3 clinical trials and the product gets approved. The news headlines hit that a company cured alzheimers. Now the shares you bought for $0.03 are suddenly worth $15. Your degree in neuroscience just paid off better than your actual day job as a neuroscientist. As the stock keeps trending upwards the $300 you spent is now $150,000. This gain is mostly attributable to using your existing knowledge to get ahead of a pivot in investor sentiment.

Use what you know. Just like the example above. Everyone has areas they are more or less knowledgeable about. If you know a lot about technology, focus on technology stocks. If you are a geologist, focus on mining stocks. Anyone can have an advantage. Even if you’re working at a deadbeat job and you get a free sample for an air freshener that finally actually gets rid of the smell of stale cigarettes in your well used car, invest in that air freshener. Any single piece of knowledge you have about any single thing can be used to your advantage to make a trade.

Which company evaluations actually do matter? Is the company going to be able to survive? That’s the main thing I’ve been looking at with my speculations. A company could have come out with a technological breakthrough. But do they have the funding or an existing revenue stream to carry it out? Are they going to be consumed by debt and implode or are they getting funding in one way or another? Another important one is if another company will buy them out. If a company has mediocre performance and is going to be bought out by Microsoft that can be great for your investment. But if a company has a breakthrough, doesn’t have the resources to commercialize it themselves and has to give in to the highest bidder for a buyout then the upside to your investment is going to be a lot more limited.

Those are really the only company metrics I’m focused on.

Stay up to date on your investments. Don’t just look at your portfolio once a month and complain about it going up or down. Is your chart going up? Find out why. Is your chart going down? Find out why.

Stay ahead of the news! If it’s 5am and you have to get up for work, get in the habit of quickly checking the news on your tickers so that you can stay on top of any changes. The sooner you know bad news came out the more likely it is you will be able to hit the sell button before anyone else does. If you have tickers you’re watching, try to buy in the moment there is good news or in advance of the good news. Especially if the sentiment is positive.

Be careful with stop losses. If you don’t know what a stop loss is, it basically means that you have set up your purchase so that your broker will sell your shares for you if they dip below a certain amount. They can be great for risk management but they can also screw you over. If you bought a company for $10 and you have a stop loss at $8 you won’t be happy when it dips to $7.50 before shooting up to $20. Because now your stop loss actually worked against you. You lost a +100% gain and you secured a loss. Another time stop losses can be unhelpful is if your stock is trading on a foreign exchange as well. For example, if you have a stock on the NASDAQ trading for $10 and a stop loss for $9 but it also trades on a European exchange. It the stock closes at $10 but tanks overnight and trading opens at $5 on the NASDAQ, your stop loss will have done nothing. Even worse, it’s possible your stop loss won’t be triggered at all now because the system won’t pull the trigger while the price of the shares continues to drop.

Market buys, market sells, limit buys and limit sells. I see a lot of confusion about this online and quite a few people get limit orders mixed up with the bid-ask spread. Small fish investors like retail have nothing to do with the bid-ask spread. When you place a market buy order through your broker you are agreeing to purchase a set number of shares at the current market price. I never use market orders. Why? Because if you execute a market buy or a market sell and the price of the security changes rapidly it won’t fill at all. And in order to cancel it and place a new order you first have to find it, then cancel it and then place a new order. I always use limit orders. If I’m buying shares and the cost looks like it’s on an upwards trend I will always place a limit buy for a price quite a bit higher than the current market value. Some people seem to think you won’t get the best price possible that way but this is wrong. If a stock is trading for $8 and you put in a limit buy for $8.50 but the stock only goes up to $8.10 your broker will fill it at $8.10. If I’m buying shares and the cost of the security looks like it’s currently on a downwards trend I will place a limit buy just a bit above what I think it will drop down to. That way I don’t have to stare at the chart all day and I can check throughout the day and place a new order if the direction changed and it didn’t fall below that point yet. As far as selling goes I will always place limit orders as well to guarantee the trade goes through instead of putting faith in a lack of volatility and risking the sell not going through. If the stock is going down I will place a limit sell for a lower price. If the stock is going up I will place a limit sell for a higher price. I won’t make them too much higher or too much lower though because this is the opposite of buying and I don’t want the stock to get stuck to my hands when I’m trying to dump it.

Since investor sentiment drives the price of shares, wouldn’t it be nice if there was a single quick way to gauge the current investor sentiment towards a company? As it turns out, you can! And you can do it really quickly by eyeballing a chart even if you don’t have a clue what you’re doing. Here’s how. Take a look at the chart. Focus on points in the chart where there have been sudden upwards and sudden downwards movements. And look at what happens following those movements.

If the stock dropped 12% due to some bad news, what happens next? Does it stay down or does it climb back up? The quicker it climbs back up out of a dip, the more positive investor sentiment is.

If the stock jumped up 12% due to some good news, what happens next? Does it stay up and slowly keep rising or does it tank back down to levels even lower than before the spike? The quicker it drops back down after a spike, the more negative investor sentiment is.

Keep in mind though that investor sentiment can change and just because there has been overall positive or negative sentiment in the past does not mean that the sentiment will continue. Check news for any updates on the company. Make sure nothing is in the works that could cause the sentiment to change to the negative when you are buying in. Check stock message boards. Check financial news. Use your brokers news feed, they are often quicker to the punch.

It’s definitely more profitable to buy something that has overall positive sentiment.

Edit: I will add, don’t ever be afraid to re-evaluate your strategy. If it isn’t working there’s a good chance it will keep not working. It’s better to try something new than to watch your portfolio slowly erode while you have plenty of time to research and make new moves."

Instead if you looked at the chart, you'd realize you're buying at an all time high and if you wait a bit for a pullback (based on the chart) you'd get a significantly better entry."

If people are going to do bad research that just reassures them to buy at an unfair price, I wonder how valuable it actually is... Just my ramblings tho!

Nevertheless, I strongly agree with the author. It should be a mandatory tutorial for every new investor to read before  starting their game. 

The problem is that even though we know all of it, we are still influenced by our psychology. 

FOMO (+lack of critical thinking) - whenever someone is posting his/her positive portfolio, I see follow-the-leader strategy, where people blindly jump ship without thinking why it is green and if it's sustainable or not.

Procrastination - Many people are just lazy. Why bother to learn how to do DD, when you can watch 1-2 videos, read few posts or just yolo into random or bluechip stock. We all did it at least once. Sometimes it went well, sometimes not...

Instant gratification - I think this is the most self-destructing mechanism. That's one of the reason why every subreddit has a daily thread. People are following their portfolio every day, wishing to see a sudden jump. We are very sensitive about any slight drop. It's okay if you are day trader or swing trader playing short/mid term, but many claims that they are long-term,  yet still follow their portfolio everyday.

2021-05-18 22:23:36,stocks,"There are two popular types of IRAs (Individual Retirement Account)

Roth - Your income tax for that year doesnt change. But your Roth IRA grows tax free. You dont have to pay taxes in retirement.

Traditional - You are not taxed for the amount you deposit into this account on your taxes for that year (up to 6k). You are taxed as income when you take it out in retirement.

Same thing goes for 401k (Company sponsored IRA basically). You put your money in, many companies match a percentage. They can be Roth or Traditional, but limits are higher. I think they are 19k. Company match doesnt count as part of the 19k if I remember correctly.

2021-05-19 14:57:34,stocks,"It's hypervolatile(though seems to have cooled off in the last month or so) and I'm very averse to any IPOs in this market as I've already seen quite a few tech companies inflate then crash and burn. Given the hype around it and its 50%(was 100%) runup following IPO and how historically most IPOs crash within a year this puts it at what I view as a technical premium, regardless of any fundamentals behind it.

I don't really think that the peripherals market or ""gaming"" is a sector worth exploring due to what I presume to be low margins, slow growth and high competition, and while they do seem to offer components like RAM and PSUs I don't think that gives them a significant enough moat in the computing space. If I wanted to tackle computing and consumer hardware I'd prefer my money be in NVidia, AMD, or Microsoft as I think they have significantly better moats and the semiconductor industry is always booming.

I haven't looked too deeply at their financials admittedly, however I'm guessing with covid it'd be difficult to really tell what their future earnings will be as work from home drastically inflated computer peripheral sales and I don't view that as sustainable going forward. With the aforementioned problems I have with it from a technical viewpoint, all it takes is a very likely decline in sales for a couple quarters to cause it to plummet as hype wanes"

I refuse to follow the philosophy of generalizations: ""historically most IPOs crash within a year this puts it at what I view as a technical premium, regardless of any fundamentals behind it."" Not saying that you are wrong in that statement, but I prefer to base my decisions off the specifics of a company rather than a broad generalization. It's something to still consider, but should be a small factor in the decision process. 

I'm just going to sound like a salesperson for their products if I fully address your second point, but I will say that they will MAYBE expand their operations as they have historically done in the past by going into console controllers, prebuilt pcs/laptops, etc. I don't disagree that NVida, AMD, or Microsoft are bad investments. I think they are excellent investments for the long term, but I think Corsair still have significant room for growth with only a 3 billion market cap. Obviously there are other factors to consider, but I would like to keep the point concise unless there is something else you want to bring up.

Their financials are top tier with very conservative estimates for their earnings for next quarter. They've knocking it out of the park every quarter. I don't think with COVID receding that their sales will diminish at all. In fact, I think with people staying home from COVID has spread awareness about CRSR. With more people transitioning to working from home, their sales will probably continue to rise.

Not saying this stock has no risks, but I think it's a solid investment. I'm also hedging the bet by doing a box spread by selling call options with a delta of .14 or less every month. I for the most part respect your opinion and you may be right in your analysis."
2021-05-19 15:46:33,stocks,"Admittedly I've tended to operate more on swing trading than buy and hold so that likely skews my perception of the long term potential prospects of the company which comes at odds with your more fundamentally driven approach. I have other sectors I'd prefer to be in right now were I to long hold, though this damn market as a whole has me on edge what with the inflation fears, speculative stocks dropping 30-50% in a month, and half the market being seemingly priced for the next 5 years of growth. It's making it extremely difficult to figure out what to do. The last thing I want to touch right now are smaller growth companies trying to find their bearings both financially and in terms of price discovery."
2021-05-19 16:20:45,stocks,"If it weren't for swing trading options my portfolio would've been destroyed. Towards the end, I did actually lose a lot of money on my meme stocks by holding some of them long, but I gained it all back by swing trading AMD, REDACTED, REDACTED, REDACTED, and REDACTED

I know you didn't ask, but if you're interested in the history of my portfolio.. Made 64k off of Palantir off of 30k. Cashed out and bought MRNA. Lost a quarter of my portfolio and had to wait a month for it to fully recover and then some. Bought so many meme stocks after that ""diversifying"" into about 30 different ones. Cashed out on a lot of them and then made significantly bad calls at the start of February by buying at the wrong time and basically losing 50% or more on these speculative stocks. Started swing trading like mad. Lost most of the trades, but the ones that I did win were in the 10s of thousands while my combined losses from swing trading was around 5k. And as of today I'm back at my highest point again for the fourth time mostly by luck.

I'm changing my strategy to one that is based more on fundamentals because this shit is actually pretty stressful. I feel like based of my heuristic analysis that CRSR isn't as bad a totally speculative stock, it isn't as safe as a blue chip, but it's right in the middle at least from what I see.

If you don't mind me asking what are your plays or are you still trying to figure it out?

2021-05-19 17:04:43,stocks,"Guess I may as well share my history. Well I went all into cruises during the crash. Bought the absolute bottom, sold the top of the first stimulus pump, then bought the bottom again a week later. Turned 15k into like 40k in like a month. Pretty darn proud of that. Made the stupid mistake of holding those longer than I should as they traded sideways for months costing me deeply in oppourtunity cost. After that I went balls deep into very aggressive swing trading on margin. Just so happened to do that a month before the vaccine announcement in October(okay not that coincidental, I'd been banking on vaccine announcements in fall) which meant like 50% profits in a month. Made tons off MA, SJM, LADR, AMZN, and NET. Bought a ton of HD and FB during the February corrections and would have made like 100k had I held those bad boys but I got impatient and only made like 15k I think(doubt I would have held that far anyways oh well). Almost lost my ass on ICLN and NET but my spidey sense was screaming at me to sell so I did. I did buy gee em ee at 16 and had I held that about a month I'd be a millionaire, but chickened out and lost 10k instead. Sucks to suck I guess lol. All in all my overly aggressive trading paid off handsomely, but now I want to preserve that wealth.

>If you don't mind me asking what are your plays or are you still trying to figure it out?

Currently all cash for the last month or two. Did some light trading for funsies the other day and made 2k but otherwise I dunno anymore. Cash is trash, but all my favorites have all run up, even the indexes. Were I to put my money in I'd say Visa/MA would be the safest bets while still being aggressive. They have by far the sexiest long term chart I've seen in terms of stable growth with enough volatility to make a profit swing trading, and I'm speculating their mix of growth and value ensures a sort of internal hedging regardless of how the economy goes, but what the hell do I know I'm not a macroeconomist. I'd love to buy AMD but every time I look at it that 50% runup that's practically a vertical line back in june 2020 really worries me, like it'll just collapse the second I buy it. Buuut it could also rocket up to 100 leaving me looking like a fool. A microcosm of my views on the market as a whole as of late.

>I'm changing my strategy to one that is based more on fundamentals because this shit is actually pretty stressful.

Edit: Should add this line made me laugh. Ain't that the fuckin truth. Being leveraged so much a single percent is a month's salary does a lot to one's stress levels. Sitting in cash has been a boon to my mental health and a reminder that financial health is but one aspect of one's life."
2021-05-19 17:38:07,stocks,"I bought puts and calls on AMD at the same time a year out. I waited until I made a few g's from the puts as it went way down initially in the first month. Then it went way up the next month and sold the calls for a few g's. But man, if I would've just kept doing that I would've made so much more money as I think I found the rhythm to it. I think straddles are such an underrated strategy and I want to practice it more. AMD might be the one to straddle as I doubt it will trade sideways for a year. I've also been considering buying puts on Tesla for a while..

But yeah, if you aren't a fan of options, what's worked for me for a decade was putting my money in VTI, S&P 500, and VUG. I've just started recently with individual stocks in September last year out of boredom at work and I've been looking for someone to talk about this stuff with as all my online friends are almost completely illiterate when it comes to investing lol.

2021-05-19 00:00:00,stocks,"RIDE stock - what would you buy at? The best time to buy Lordstown Motors was May 7-14. Too late. Like other stocks that bottom out, it can often rebound at a ridiculous ROI. 

Is there a price you think you would make it worth it? Would you buy even if you didn't believe in the company?

I'm thinking $9 and if it goes anywhere near as high as it used to be, massive profit.

As has been stated in other threads, concentrating a bigger % of your portfolio can be very rewarding. So, buy? Or no, because you think the company will go broke/become worthless?"

But lets looks at things a bit more realistically. If someone lies to you about business pre-orders why would you do business with them again? As they say, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me...

All indications are they are the paid contractors to put in fake pre-orders. They also made some up some pre-orders out of thin air and they were refuted by the companies they claimed placed them. They also promised a truck for sale by the end of this year. There is practically no way thats going to happen.

I would wait. Their stock wont go up to previous highs again. Thats over. People learned their lesson. You will need to wait for the next generation to make that mistake again. There is a bigger chance it will go to $5 than to $20 at this point given market conditions overall."

KO has always traded around 25 PE. Today its around 30. But note their earnings took a big covid beating due to restaurant closure. So odds are that once things are on track, PE is probably back to 25.

GIS, PE is actually hovering towards historic lows. its at 15 while historic average is 20. Granted they had a covid boost but was it really 25%? Doubt it.

JNJ is a bit higher than historic average but still well within their normal range. We can also argue they had a slight covid slowdown and are in good position going forward due to having the most stable and easy to administer vaccine.

PFE historic average of 23. We are currently at 20.

LMT has a historic average of18.5. Its currently at 15.

Also despite AMD flashing good tech, they were never able to penetrate enterprise in the past. Athlon had major thermal issues. This time they did. In fact they are a big player in servers today. I find that my servers on GC running Ryzen outperform their Xeon counterparts dollar for dollar. This is bad news for Intel because their position in enterprise was thought to be unshakable.

Dont get me wrong, I think Intel can do a lot of things to get back on track. All I am saying is when investing, you should wait to see the plan first. There is really no rush. Its not like they are going to magically find new market share to grow exponentially in the next 5 years."

2021-05-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Billionaire investor and Hedge Fund Manager Stanley Druckenmiller loads up on $139,367,000 of Palantir shares, sells Carnival Cruise Line https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stanley-druckenmiller-13f-palantir-stock-duquesne-carnival-coupang-disney-pltr-2021-5-1030442680

Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office took up new stakes in Palantir, Citigroup, and Coupang during the first quarter of 2021, regulatory filings show.

Druckenmiller scooped up 5,983,992 shares of Palantir worth $139,367,000 at the time of the March 31 filing. It's the opposite move from Third Point's Dan Loeb, who sold all of his Palantir stake in the first quarter of 2021. The big data surveillance company is down nearly 9% year-to-date. 

Like Loeb, Druckenmiller trimmed his stake in Amazon, selling 7,105 shares. His fund now holds 75,648 shares of Amazon for a value of $234,061,000 at the filing time.

Druckenmiller also added a big bet on newly public company Coupang. The Korean e-commerce company was the largest US IPO in the first quarter of 2021, raising $4.6 billion, according to Renaissance Capital. Druckenmiller added 714,285 shares.

The investor also appears to be betting on the financial sector. He took a new stake in Citigroup, purchasing 2,124,909 million shares worth $154,587,000 at the time of filing. He also scooped up 258,420 of JPMorgan Chase, and added positions in Visa and Mastercard.

Druckenmiller liquidated his positions in cyclical stocks like Disney, cruise liner Carnival Crop, and Live Nation Entertainment. However, he appears to be still betting on the rebound of travel out of the pandemic, as seen by his new $69.7 million stake in online travel company Booking Holdings Inc.

In a recent CNBC interview, the investor said that a ""monkey could make money in this market,"" due to the 
Federal Reserve's easy monetary policies that have pumped ample 
liquidity into all financial markets."

2021-05-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Are lithium mining stocks a hedge against inflation? If commodities like gold and mining stocks tend to go up during periods of higher inflation, then would lithium mining be a good hedge against inflation?

Independent of inflation, it has a lot of near future demand regarding EVs, 5G phones, etc.

What do you guys think?"
2021-05-19 02:17:34,stocks,"REITs are similar to gold in terms of “inflation hedge”, probably okay but nothing special. Financials (banks) are quite dependent on interest rates and yield curves - nowadays it is not an easy business to run a traditional bank, yields are manipulated by central banks and your business is overregulated by the government. Of course still a better hedge against inflation than lithium. :)

There are many companies pitching the same thing. Umicore (already doing that), a few ones in Australia, Vulcan in Germany.

In the end it’s all about supply and demand. If you won’t have batteries to recycle, then your technology is not used to its potencial (likely scenario in the next at least 5-10 years). If you have cheap and green source of lithium (possible in 10+ years) then recycling processes won’t be that important."

2021-05-19 00:00:00,stocks,"I have a few questions about the idea of Quote Stuffing I've embarked on creating a software that automatically detects fraud attempts through analysing a transaction history stored in CSV files. I must first fully understand the idea bheind Quote Stuffing before emplementing the necessary code.

So from my basic understanding. The fraud dude will post a large buying order of stocks of X. This would be done through HFT algorithms to ensure a large order in a small amount of time, which will task the system a lot of processing time to deal with it. When the price goes up as a result, the fraud dude will cancel their buying order and sell whatever X stocks they've got at that price, making profit.

My questions are: 

* In what form is this Large buy order executed? Are we talking about a high number of consecutive micro buys, or a single big order of an insane number of stocks.
* If, it's a successsion of micro orders, what's the appropriate time interval, from the first fake order to the last, for this to be considered a Quote Stuffing attempt. e.i a 1000 orders in 2 seconds? Can the system detect orders from other traders in between the fraudulant orders?
* does the time of cancelling and amount of canceled orders matter? If so, how long would it take for the fraud dude to cancel, and how much would they have to cancel (100%, 80%, etc)?"

It also owns the Epix cable channel and makes TV shows, including The Handmaid’s Tale and Fargo, and reality shows such as Shark Tank and Survivor.

2021-05-18 23:37:09,stocks,Walmart is the one attacking Amazon in E-commerce lol. They just entered it. And who tf is scared of Kroger and Target after all these years in comparison to Walmart. They’ve been around for decades.
2021-05-19 00:20:01,stocks,"They have a subscription model with W+, they're not competing in the same category as Amazon and WF, Costco is an in warehouse membership model that is entirely different. Target focuses more on higher margin sales than anything else. 

WalMart is using an omnichannel strategy and has access to 90% of all homes in the US via delivery. They beat Amazon (by far) on pricing of shipped or pickup options. The only real competitor to Walmart right now is Target. 

I own both WalMart and Costco. Both have a low beta, with Walmart acting as a pseudo bond in an all equity portfolio. 

Nothing wrong with any of the companies we're taking about though. I like them all."
2021-05-18 23:38:50,stocks,"Yes but Amazon is superior and with acquisitions like with Whole Foods it competes directly with Walmart. Kroger’s various pharmacy partnerships and target’s advancing e-commerce, as well as its growing success year over year means that both present threats to Walmart too."
2021-05-18 23:46:47,stocks,Whole Foods has been a laughably terrible acquisition for Amazon. You just don’t here about it because it was a drop in the bucket for amazon.
2021-05-18 23:07:40,stocks,"Technically, Bezos is no longer at the helm, and it is within the realm of possibility that AMZN would split. Bezos' idea was to limit the capability of day traders and swing traders from gambling on his stock. Its also quite a bit harder to play with options on a 3k stock. Ironically, keeping the share price high does artificially slow down the growth of the stock, as there are tons of investors worldwide who are unable to buy fractional shares, and there is a psychological component of owning 'full shares'. Options writers also prefer lots of 100, so owning any decent position in AMZN is very difficult. Both AAPL and TSLA went up >40% post split with zero change in fundamentals and fully retained the gains. A stock split would almost certainly sent AMZN surging up."

2021-05-19 02:01:02,stocks,"90% of driving can be automated. I use autopilot on highways almost exclusively. 

That being said I don't see my Tesla being able to handle normal city street driving due to nuances fully automated. They might get there in the next decade if the entire fleet of Teslas can update real world road conditions 24/7 and build a neural network that Elon has been talking about.

It would essentially be a database continuously updated about each and every road by each and every Tesla in conjunction with all the automated recognition in their software and hardware. It's cool to see traffic signs, vehicles, traffic symbols being recognized by the AI. I can see a few iterations later how the computer could drive itself it it were to be able to mimic human driving 100% if not better."

2021-05-18 23:59:26,stocks,">No system is able to handle bad weather, especially snowstorms.

This is where I think the industry might be fucking up. Mobileye (intel) allegedly has 13/15 top manufacturers (and more smaller ones) as their partners for autonomous driving. Why not build in a wireless module that reports your location and what your car sees to cars around it with the same systems. This solves a LOT of problems as your going from like 6 cameras and lidar that are in a fixed position to say 30 that are in different positions. Obviously a lot of old cars will be on the road for decades, but as long as the smart cars can see them, the data can be reported. This would help in bad weather too, where cars all might be partially obstructed, but together they can map the surrounding area."

Also, this gem: ""you can’t have some engineer sign off on 1M lines of code and say “this is safe”."" My man, google ""NASA"" for me before you comment on engineering please. 

You have no idea what you're talking about. In either insurance or engineering. Your whole comment is nonsense. You may have fooled people on Reddit, but I know."
2021-05-19 00:13:41,stocks,"That's not the issue, heavy rain and snowstorms create too much noise for any computer to analyse and discard what isn't an obstacle, to all systems it looks like there's a wall in front of the car.

Our brain is an expert at filtering noise and becoming numb to stuff we don't need to focus on... I don't know if you live far enough to the north to get snowstorms but you can imagine the difference between what we see and what a computer would see just by focusing on the snow while driving in a snowstorm, everything else disappears, it's just millions of white dots flying everywhere."
2021-05-19 03:34:27,stocks,"I believe that FSD will need infrastructural data (e.g. sensors on the road) and many type of sensors on the car to be realized. 

 In 5 years ABSOLUTELY NOT. you'll se autonomous driving from point A to B in a predefined route (like waymo) first. 

If you ask me in 10 years? I would answer also NO. 

As FSD we mean level 5 without driver and everywhere."

2021-05-19 02:32:35,stocks,"all her cases for Tesla are really fucking stupid.

She will get really strong headwinds with rising interest rates and she somehow has to secure more money inflow than outflow, due to her owning really large % of illiquid companies, or else the outflow of money will directly tank her holdings even more."
2021-05-19 06:58:53,stocks,I see. Sensors on the road is so very far away...I wonder if they’re considering that.
2021-05-19 19:28:12,stocks,"Idk about 2024, but that’s not the point you were trying to make. I’m saying it’s definitely possible, it might take 5-10 years, but definitely possible. You are saying it’s not, don’t move the goal post now"

2021-05-18 22:14:16,stocks,"I liked the idea of teslas until I learned about them having dlc. I assume elon would shutter at the idea of right to repair as well. Even without those things I doubt I'd use any autonomous driving features until it was ready.

Regardless of what tesla is technically saying people think these things drive themselves even after said person gets arrested for letting go down the highway while they hang out in the back."
2021-05-19 19:32:32,stocks,"Yea ok, let's make 10 years then (even if Elon is saying that it is almost ready, which is a huge lie).

-> I don't believe that FSD level 5 will be ready in 10 years from now. As FSD (as intended by Tesla) I mean a car that can drive EVERYWHERE and don't even need a steering wheel. All by using exclusively Cameras: NO lidar, NO infrastructural sensors (e.g. road sensors) and so on."

2021-05-19 19:08:10,stocks,Lmao awful attempt at covering your imbecilic posts
2021-05-19 00:10:02,stocks,"I see examples like this all the time and find them quite reductive. Human capacity to drive is at an end-state. All our biological/neurological advantages are baked in and essentially maxed out. In aggregate, humans will never be meaningfully better drivers than we are now. Computer are not yet great at city driving, but are getting better and *will only* *get better* (barring an inevitable hiccup in the form of a Therac-25-style programming disaster, ETA 2027). 

Here's a counter-scenario. It is obviously not where we are at now, but it's where we are headed: 

  
Ok, so a soccer ball rolls out from between two cars. You, a human, have two eyes and they are pointed elsewhere, and/or you're thinking about something else, and/or you're distracted by another person or beeping thing in your own car, and/or you're tired, and/or you're old and have poor reflexes. You see the ball, but at a delay—you stop but in the process a) you give the hypothetical lil tyke a love-tap resulting in a minor concussion and a major lawsuit and/or b) a car following you too close rear-ends you at somewhere between 0-35 mph, depending on their own confounding factors, because the same issues apply to them, people are impatient and self-centred, and they can't read your mind. 

  
Your car, an AI trained over several years at a rate of billions and then tens of billions of miles per year, has \~9 eyes arranged with full 360º coverage, redundant along the most important vector (ahead of you). They all feed data at a constant, manageable and predictable rate to dual redundant chipsets custom-designed for the task, at a faster FPS than humans can process. It is in constant communication with every car around you via a shared protocol designed to optimize the behaviour of unrelated vehicles in traffic and to coordinate reactions to unexpected events. Your car knows there's a meaningful chance that a child or dog follows that ball, because duh: this has happened literally millions of times in its training. It stops faster than you possibly could, and signals the car behind you to do the same, essentially in real-time. You probably avoid hitting the kid, but if you do it's at a much lower speed than you would have without a self-driving vehicle; ditto for your hypothetical rear-ender. If anyone hits anything the legal burden settles somewhere up the chain and isn't your problem. 

  
Like I said, this is not where we are but it is where we're going. The inflection point for cars outperforming human drivers in incidents/mile on highways has almost certainly already been passed by the most capable systems.

It's so easy to get caught up in worst-case scenarios and what-ifs and they need to be accounted for, definitely. But what about the possible upside? Don't we want the driving experience to become more frictionless (figuratively, of course), less fraught with biological, financial and moral hazards? Between human and AI, only one path leads to meaningful progress from where we are. We're not at an end-state unless we insist we are."
2021-05-19 19:38:30,stocks,"I am definitely in the school that we need Lidar and infrastructure. I’m only a small investor in Tesla, so I think Elon will need to backtrack some of his statements going forward. I don’t see regulators allowing a pure camera system to do FSD, they’ll need lidar even just to ensure public safety as a fail safe. However, 10 years is a long time in technology, especially AI, this shit is exponential, humans are really bad at visualizing exponential growth/improvements, so I don’t blame you.

How was the AI tech 10 years ago compared to now? Remember that the next 10 years we will dwarf the advancement of the past 10 years. With each year exponentially better than the last. So it’s not a question of if, but how much faster we’ll be able to achieve it than expectations. China’s self driving tech is already miles better than Tesla in real world driving, I have no doubt they’ll be able to achieve L5 before 2030"

Let’s say Amazon Pharmacy eventually becomes huge and they start offering pet medications as well. That’s direct competition for a major part of Chewy’s revenue, except they also have basically infinite money that they can use to offer better prices. So basically Chewy has to lean on their superior customer service and hope that’s enough of a moat to keep Amazon out of their castle.

Over the last 12-months i’m up on the market by about 40%. I never hold less than 50% of my portfolio in Index funds, and I never hold more than 6 tickers total (options included). Discipline, rules, and humility are how you run the marathon. The sprint is for suckers.

Obviously JOAN will not grow to that kind of size, but the fact that those businesses can't be pushed around as much by Amazon etc. There are obviously some exceptions; lots of the categories sold will definitely have high competition.  


A brief glance at Finviz shows some pretty enticing numbers, other than the debt. P/s is a dream come true at an absolutely groundbreaking 0.18.

  
As per their last quarterly report, it looks like they are growing. However, I'm cautious as I do not know the company history or why they currently have so much debt.

Like when people always say ""past performance doesn't guarantee future performance"" and then they'll cite why I should invest in the sp500 cause of past 7% a year performance.  Really irks me!

The same people who would say it was a mistake to only invest in faang, would've said similar 10 years ago and missed out on life changing returns instead 3x ing there money in the index.

Divide 10k up amongst aapl msft fb googl amzn etc on portfolio visualizer and see what you'd end up with from 2010 until now."
2021-05-18 22:15:28,stocks,"The main reason some FAANGs will grow slower in the future is because they are running out of potential users. 

It was easy for FB to grow from 1 million to 1 billion monthly active users (a factor of 1000). It's impossible for FB to grow from 1 billion to 1 trillion users (another factor of 1000), because this many people don't exist. It's also becoming very difficult for FB to grow revenue per user without losing users.

To grow more, they will have to invent all new sellable technology from zero, like Apple did with iPhone for example, and this is a lot harder to accomplish consistently and open to competition by new startups.

Furthermore, there is significant regulatory headwind coming up for the ad-tech companies (FB and Google), and potentially higher corporate taxes in multiple big markets.

Amazon and Microsoft are in a different league, and in my opinion have more room for growth because the move to cloud computing is not nearly complete yet, and there is no limit to how much cloud computing power a single human user might want or need in the future.

Apple is Apple. I can't see a downside there, other than the fact that a very large portion of their revenue comes from China, which carries geopolitical risk."

I'm also in other stocks up to 5% each.  UNH HD SHW NVDA LRCX ASML PYPL SQ UNP.  I try and just have a diverse portfolio.  I don't know which stock will outperform.  It's kind of fun just seeing how they all do.

I've got 11% in FSKAX Total Market also.  Whatever happens will happen.

From all I hear GOOGL is one of the best faangs to have this year.  So I just recently got in with 1 share.

I feel that most faangs may double at least in the next 5 years, but no one knows."

2021-05-19 17:21:10,stocks,"The buyback? or did I miss a dividend announcement? Because I would really like to have just missed that dividend announcement.

2021-05-19 17:49:11,stocks,"They said they wanted to return value to their shareholders, the only way to do that besides buybacks is dividends. Personally I think it's only a matter of time, especially after the Xilinx merger."

2021-05-19 13:43:49,stocks,"I think that you are missing the point of Twilio as a platform. They are not an SMS service, they are a communications API. They facilitate communication in anyway that companies would like to communicate with their users. SMS is 43% of revenue because that is their flagship product. They also have an email API (revenue from that grows by 30% a year) and people have been saying the same thing about email going away for 20 years. But you are missing the broader strategy, they are using their own infrastructure to fund the buildout of applications that will eventually provide a wholistic solution for enterprise companies. Flex uses all of their messaging APIs to bring support center infrastructure into the cloud. My prediction is that they will build or buy a CRM to facilitate sales communication with users. And to tie it all together they have Segment which will bring all of your communication data and usage data into a single warehouse. They have the infrastructure and will keep expanding both the API platform and services platforms with no end for their potential growth in sight."

2021-05-18 23:44:08,stocks,"I'd be wary about this. The issue is the market never stays the same for long. Your trading stategy is probably going to do well in some conditions but not others. You should really know how to trade as many situations as possible, even if it's just to be able to work out when ***not*** to trade."

2021-05-19 19:51:21,stocks,"Forward testing provides more realistic conditions (though I suppose that can suffer the same issue). Though I was more referring to being wary of overoptimization of a strategy, though suppose that is less of an issue if you are trading manually."

2021-05-19 07:40:57,stocks,Thank you! That was exactly what I was wondering. If I use any of it I wanna pay it off right away. My bank account is just been slow or RH is. I tried to deposit money in there last week and it’s taking forever and in the meantime I get itchy if I don’t have any buying power
2021-05-18 22:17:07,stocks,"That’s interesting, because I happen to have a degree in physics, and friends in the valley that are all 99.999999999% sure that in our permutation of existence, hard physical limits exist that are unsurpassable. 

This list is by no means exhaustive....

Processing and memory density:
The Bekenstein bound limits the amount of information that can be stored within a spherical volume to the entropy of a black hole with the same surface area.

Thermodynamics limit the data storage of a system based on its energy, number of particles and particle modes. In practice, it is a stronger bound than the Bekenstein bound.

Processing speed:
Bremermann's limit is the maximum computational speed of a self-contained system in the material universe, and is based on mass-energy versus quantum uncertainty constraints.

Communication delays:
The Margolus–Levitin theorem sets a bound on the maximum computational speed per unit of energy: 6 × 10^33 operations per second per joule. This bound, however, can be avoided if there is access to quantum memory. Computational algorithms can then be designed that require arbitrarily small amounts of energy/time per one elementary computation step.

Energy supply:
Landauer's principle defines a lower theoretical limit for energy consumption: kT ln 2 consumed per irreversible state change, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the operating temperature of the computer. Reversible computing is not subject to this lower bound. T cannot, even in theory, be made lower than 3 kelvins, the approximate temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, without spending more energy on cooling than is saved in computation. However, on a timescale of 10^9 - 10^10 years, the cosmic microwave background radiation will be decreasing exponentially, which has been argued to eventually enable 10^30 as much computations per unit of energy."
2021-05-18 23:46:06,stocks,"The likelihood of being audited is slim to none unless you commit a felony and the government wants to find more shit about you to make you squeal. Don't commit a serious felony and not report capital gains for a year or two here and there and I doubt you'd ever get caught.

Tax evasion is real and extremely easy. As a member of a minority community that has many small businesses you would be shocked as an average American how easy and proliferate not reporting accurate taxes is. Asians can whip out 600k in cash to buy a house but don't even make enough on IRS income disclosures to get a 600k bank loan.

My father makes upwards of 250k a year and reports he only makes 36k a year for the last two decades and he's been audited once already due to legal issues unrelated to the business. He ended up paying the back taxes and interest. He now simply omits cash transactions at our business so that essentially makes half the business income untraceable. On paper everything looks legit because it was filed legally and appropriately. If you don't think wealthy American's do something simlar you're a bit naive.

I'm not even going to get into how easy it is to augment your income to secure a bank loan. Start a small business and essentially pay yourself a salary that is 3x the interest payment on said loan to meet bank guidelines. Pay a little more in taxes this year to get that big loan you want later. This is essentially the definition of a shell business/corporation."

2021-05-19 07:09:38,stocks,There's not enough information to understand the situation. When you sold the 40 shares did you sell for a profit or a loss intentionally? If you sold at a loss then you triggered a wash sale on 40 shares of the other lot because you may be inside the 31 day window. If you thought you were selling 40 shares at a profit it is possible you sold the wrong shares. For example the system sold 40 shares First In First out and sold 40 out of the first 50 shares at a loss thus triggering a wash sale on ten shares and 30 shares of another lot. When you have to separate lots with purchase dates that close together inside 30 day window you need to be careful to not sell at a loss. Obviously if you sold at a higher price of both lots you would not have noticed an issue so I am assuming the sell price is between the price of both those lots or lower.
2021-05-19 06:42:45,stocks,I wonder if you bought more shares within two days while the other ones had not cleared and you sold a bunch of First In First out shares leaving you with a combination of shares from $20.60 price and $23.50 and your new cost basis being $23.43.  When you trade shares while other shares are clearing you need to make sure you understand FIFO or LIFO.  in TDAmeritrade I always go into the uncleared area and edit my sold shares to make sure they are by ID. So that there is no confusion the system sold FIFO or LIFO I select where the shares come from. And if I trade new shares that are the latest I resell those as Last In First Out as day trades otherwise you don't know what shares you are selling. I don't think you have sold anything at a loss maybe that is your average cost?
2021-05-19 16:05:35,stocks,"They haven't turned a net profit yet, only positive gross margin. It's a risk factor language in their listing ""we may never turn a profit or sustain it"".
