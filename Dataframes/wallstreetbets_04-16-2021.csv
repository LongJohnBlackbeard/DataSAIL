2021-04-16 18:12:44,wallstreetbets,It's a risk to do a account transfer during this whole thing. What if the squeeze happens and he can't get out?. Might as well hold Robin Hood until it's over.

2021-04-16 18:54:43,wallstreetbets,"So I think this was a test run on the short interest. Earnings are May 20, and there is a huge amount of OI at $10 on May 21.

I think the real push on the shorts will be on May 20. Whoever was buying today seemed to be testing the market. Most of the shorts have bought from 15-10, so although some may have covered, most probably didn't since they weren't in danger of taking a loss.

We will probably see it taper off the next couple weeks. Probably worth taking a position."
2021-04-16 18:23:49,wallstreetbets,Fuck it in for 10 shares
2021-04-16 18:59:50,wallstreetbets,"I just picked up 25 shares in AH. Statistically, my losing streak can’t go on forever"

2021-04-16 18:40:11,wallstreetbets,I think people really have to ask themselves why didn't the Hindenburg Group disclose the exact discrepancy they claim was confirmed by FactSet? They responded with nothing but a vague email and  their other tweet had already been disproven prior? If there's a legitimate large discrepancy why wouldn't they disclose it?  This whole thing reeks of FUD. They clearly are paid to attack $CLOV.

2021-04-16 17:51:08,wallstreetbets,"Now the other side (those H guys) says they spoke with FactSet and FactSet admitted they were wrong.  I have no idea who is right, I’m just watching from Twitter yelling “Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight...”."

2021-04-16 18:08:05,wallstreetbets,Hindenburg is desperate. There was no error in FactSet. CEO (who btw is also the founder of CLOV) shares are not part of the float
2021-04-16 17:51:52,wallstreetbets,Haha amen
2021-04-16 19:49:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeahp, short squeezes are not predictable. This story looks too easy for a short squeeze. But they way Hinderburg reacted with email is interesting. It reminded me of Citron's GME video just before the squeeze the next day."
2021-04-16 18:18:03,wallstreetbets,"This. His shares shouldn’t be counted against the float since they are locked to him. Based on what I heard, the stock has to trade above $30 a share for 90 days straight before they are unlockable ."
2021-04-16 19:28:23,wallstreetbets,"Guys, no. His shares shouldn’t be counted toward the float but they weren’t to begin with. The 30.5mm were taken out of the float but his 83.4mm are CLASS B this is totally different and has nothing to do with short interest"
2021-04-16 18:24:09,wallstreetbets,But are they shortable?

2021-04-16 17:34:03,wallstreetbets,"It’s got 148% short interest, which is more than GME had when it was actually squeezing"
2021-04-16 17:28:16,wallstreetbets,Better off buying $SPY $420c expiring Tuesday.
2021-04-16 17:48:30,wallstreetbets,"148% if the CEO doesn't cash out any of his shares on a squeeze. He holds 75% of the total float, basically."
2021-04-16 18:33:29,wallstreetbets,Do people not realize companies are shorted because investors think it’ll go down. When did the notion “shorted” started to mean free money?
2021-04-16 18:09:21,wallstreetbets,"He is the founder of the company. His shares are also locked up. He can’t sell until CLOV hits $30. If $CLOV hits $30 per share every single short will be at least 75% underwater (that’s if they shorted at ATH of $17, which would impeccable timing).

Shorts are fukk. $CLOV 🚀🚀🚀"

2021-04-16 18:13:22,wallstreetbets,I'm just gonna add it's 30 USD for 90 consecutive calendar days
2021-04-16 19:34:52,wallstreetbets,It's not more shares than exist. It's more shares than currently on the float. The float can be expanded multiple ways.
2021-04-16 17:29:24,wallstreetbets,"I'm gunna take some wild guesses as to what happened here like a jackass. Maybe I hit some truth, maybe I'm completely off base... 

You paid $1.02 for these, so you either bought these last on 4/9, middle of this week or last month.

If you bought last month, tough luck man I'm assuming you were betting on a bottom reversal, almost had it!

If you bought this week or last Friday then I'm not sure why you didn't pick the 4/23 expiration so you could cover their special event next week. Or the 4/30 expiration that covers their earnings report. There was no catalyst for these calls this week man :/"

2021-04-16 16:45:37,wallstreetbets,I thought too they would hit.  I bought back my covered call to open a new one higher after the first two days of the week I thought it's going to 140.  🤔

2021-04-16 16:53:51,wallstreetbets,when did you buy these?
2021-04-16 17:36:59,wallstreetbets,"I think it might work out if the expiration date is one week out. Honestly, kind of feel the 135 wall is so steep for this week and MMs don't want us to make money on the 135 calls"
2021-04-16 17:37:46,wallstreetbets,It’s robinhoods fault. Vlad keeps all our spare change for fun
2021-04-16 18:42:20,wallstreetbets,"The catalyst were the run up to earnings. AAPL has history of going down after earnings and more so options especially are best the weeks going to earnings since after earnings the massive drop in IV will yield loses to your premiums. Even if Apple gains- the intrinsic value won’t be enough to account from the decrease on the extrinsic value. So you can actually lose even if Apple gains. 

TL;DR: the guy isn’t stupid- he just got unlucky."
2021-04-16 18:48:01,wallstreetbets,"While you made the right choice- if it wasn’t apples earning month- this would be horrible first option. AAPL is notorious at taking premiums. .5% down means you lose close to 30% down on a 1 week Call. 

I’ve been holding 133c for April 30 and even loses 10% on .5% drop"
2021-04-16 17:16:13,wallstreetbets,you're in the wrong subreddit buddy
2021-04-16 16:38:09,wallstreetbets,Literally everyone?
2021-04-16 18:15:26,wallstreetbets,"I made $ on the $135c, bought when AAPL was $130. He would have made money if he didn't pick a stupid dumb strike.

Stock? You don't belong here. r/stocks"
2021-04-16 19:03:11,wallstreetbets,"You're missing the part where he picked an expiration two weeks before AAPL's earnings. 

That's not how you play a run up. Like I said in my prior comment there were only 3 days in the last month where he could have bought these contracts for 1.02 if he bought last month then the higher success play would have been buying the earnings week expiration of 4/30 as it would retain value better over time decay for two reasons. More time till expiration and higher IV being that it's earnings week keeping options premium up till after earnings IV crush. Buying two weeks prior to the earnings date makes no sense for a run up play."
2021-04-16 17:14:06,wallstreetbets, Literally almost everyone. :)
2021-04-16 16:35:48,wallstreetbets,"You were IN the money, right? But it still lost value?"

2021-04-16 16:40:16,wallstreetbets,"His strike price plus contract price was not in the money. 

$125+29.60 = $154.60
$145+10.05 = 155.05
$160+.13 = $160.13

Closing price $154.69 = game over"

2021-04-16 16:44:50,wallstreetbets,"Exercised $125s, rolled the others. Not super thrilled, and I bought this quite awhile ago. I will see what I think about the rolled options, but future GME buys will be straight shares."

2021-04-16 16:41:22,wallstreetbets,"What? That's not true. Strike price is strike price. I exercised the 125's, rolled some of the others."

2021-04-16 16:42:11,wallstreetbets,And you didn't lose 100% either. I didn't say that. He asked how you lost money.
2021-04-16 16:47:04,wallstreetbets,Mostly agree. They were purchased before most of the DD about not buying options.
2021-04-16 18:37:53,wallstreetbets,Bless you.
2021-04-16 16:44:05,wallstreetbets,"Ok. I was responding to your ""game over"" comment. Not game over... I'm onto level 2 with shares and a few fewer sheckles than I might have otherwise had.

As a note of explanation to the original question: Yes, when I purchased the calls, they were already deep ITM. The share price crept down (by, oh, $150 from the peak), which makes the option also decrease in value."
2021-04-16 16:59:00,wallstreetbets,Won't make any difference since it would have been hedge the minute it went 10% ITM after you bought them.
2021-04-16 16:50:29,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but WSB shooters shorting shit won't actually add more fuel to whatever rocket is launching, if any - I seriously don't have a clue how many daytraders are in this.

EDIT: Mahalo for the awards my fellow window lickers. In 6 years of being on Reddit this is the first time I’ve ever been graced with an award, much less gold.

2021-04-16 16:25:39,wallstreetbets,"I literally just decided to look for this and saw immediately after posting. So it seems as though he exercised his options and bought 50,000 @ 12/share, but then are y'all saying he bought another 50,000 at the current price at around 150/share which brought his average price paid up to 55/share? That checks out bc we know he doubled down @ 40/share and then his initial investments were all below that price point. 

That means he is happy with the current price point of 150/share, and he now thinks there is deep fucking value far beyond the current price. Posted at 4:20pm none the less. What a fucking legend, I'm so happy I'm here to witness this lol."
2021-04-16 16:36:13,wallstreetbets,"""Final update"" The end of an era. Big thank you from all of us.

It probably means that he’s done because it’s up to all of us to hold now. There’s nothing else he can do. 

Basically maxed out on shares. He can’t post when he sells because that will be market manipulation. And it’s not really anyone else’s business how much he makes in the end. 

All anyone can do now is buy what you can and hold. Just like him. 

He’s just one of us now."

My beautiful kiddos won’t have to worry that college may not be obtainable next year because of my small business closing due to covid.  BUT... if we don’t moon... If I don’t see 1 penny in profit from this, I just want to tell you how thankful I am that I was afforded the opportunity to witness 💯pure selflessness and decency.  You deserve a Nobel peace prize because it takes TRUE courage to fight for humanity without ever wavering. Congratulations on your hard work and I hope to see you on the moon someday soon!

Been a rocky ride...lots of laughs and tears but you've given alot of people a feeling of brotherhood and purpose. And for that good sir, hats off to you! Hope to see you on the moon (and maybe a stream or two in the near future) best of luck my friend. 🚀🚀🚀"

Here's to having a cold one on the moon  🚀"
2021-04-16 17:35:35,wallstreetbets,"Honestly this is absolutely heroic. History books will look back on you as a hero. You may not have anticipated it ever being THIS big or exposing the crooks who are manipulating our market, BUT YOU DID! You have exposed corruption on a massive level, and let retail investors speak with their wallets. 

We like the stock.

Odds are for suits."
2021-04-16 17:36:29,wallstreetbets,"An honest good guy put in a position (spotlight) I doubt he ever wanted, and did the right thing.

Thank you DFV. You deserve your ride into the sunset"
2021-04-16 17:49:48,wallstreetbets,"This might get lost in your inbox, but

I just wanted to say how refreshing it has been to see someone stand up for something, whatever that is, and not fall into greed. Willingly losing money to stand with a community, for better or worse. That's inspiring. 

I genuinely wish you the best"
2021-04-16 18:31:10,wallstreetbets,A million dollars isn’t cool. You know what’s cool?  A billion dollars.

Edit: Don’t worry about it dude. You did good with your technical analysis, research and choice for calls and shares in $GME. You did nothing wrong and also didn’t give financial advice. We all appreciate you keeping us abreast of your YOLO retard calls that fortunately worked out for you. God bless and good luck with what ever you’re dealing with now. You did your job.

The weight of this squeeze shouldnt and doesn’t fall on his shoulders. We are all individual apes. If he sells on Monday then he sells on Monday. But do your own research.

2021-04-16 17:10:31,wallstreetbets,"Thanks DFV for the update and all the memes. 

I have been rewatching your past streams and have really appreciated the time and effort you put into them. 

Once things have settled down, if you ever decide to stream again in the future just know that I (and I imagine a lot of other on this sub as well) would look forward to tuning in, even if it wasn’t about stocks and like it was just chatting about memes/ movies/ games (that would be really fun to watch too). 

But that being said I can also understand if you don’t want to stream anymore, you should do what’s best for you.

Hope you are doing well!

Edit: fixed formatting that was bugging me"

A statue of Keith Gill Wil be commissioned to replace it.  But the artist, being an ape well versed in DFV lore, will insist on it being a bust only.

Thought, songs/lyrics, numbers are lining up in perfect synchrony.

I'm realizing that, at the age of 45, the body of my dreams is no longer beyond my reach. I can move like never before, and I'm interesting as fuck.

Even osmium is full of fluff, however, in the form of electron clouds that separate the dense atomic nuclei. Although rarefied, these clouds are robust, and even the immense pressures deep within the planet can only compress solid matter to a modest degree.

Until early 2021, this was consensus of the scientific community, when osmium was surpassed by DFV’s right nut, that comes in at an impressive 50 tons per cubic centrimeter."

He then took $7.5M DOLLARS(!), probably the majority of his profits so far, TO BUY 50,000 MORE SHARES @ $154.

Why!?

For us! Not for himself, not for just his family, not even for just us dumb apes, but as the most defiant act he could muster to defend humanity from an insidious evil and inspire change.

My wife mentioned she saw an article about DVF being able to sell his options contracts for like 7 million. I told her that theres no way he will sell and that he will exercise them for sure and he will likely buy another 50,000 on top of that. She was like, “why would he do that, when he already made millions?” I said because he believes the stock is undervalued at current price and that in his position I would do the same thing.

Maybe I am crazy late to the game, but this is so insane. Literally this is what governments do to instigate war between nations.

Could you imagine working at a company that praises deception to destroy our markets and economy?

I heard about this bot situation in the past on here, but it is just so crazy to hear this guy brag about it."

You open up a cold one in anticipation for the legend, DFV (who now is a multi-trillionaire), weekly Friday-stream. The main subject today is to talk about all the good memories from the big squeeze, the most glorious event in all of mankind, an event that made even the small fish, who only bought a couple of shares, millionaires. You take a quick look out of your window before the stream starts. You happen to make eye contact with your pet monkey. He smiles at you from his own Lamborghini. Life is good."

2021-04-16 18:09:37,wallstreetbets,Last time DFV bought shares the price sky rocketed in the following few weeks. His timing has always been impeccable timing the highs and lows so this signals to me a new low and soon moon.

2021-04-16 18:11:05,wallstreetbets,Hi mum. I am in the biggest reddit post ever!
2021-04-16 18:11:07,wallstreetbets,"He got these so long ago he killed it.  The squeeze didn’t happen in the time since he got these dirt cheap and now. Either way he killed it. He knows the math.  He got more.  It isn’t really much given his wealth status now not a YOLO but he clearly believes and that 50k. Each share can be god knows.  

Imagine having the fortune of a life time in luck. He deserves this. The thing with his sister passing. His scrutiny to congress.  All he did was research a company he felt was worth $25 or more years ago and ... the rest is history.  This csn happen to any of us. Make your own path. Find a stock. Study it. Believe in the company for 3 + years. Any stock with common sense and a good pick will move up in that time frame.  

It changes lives when you invest the real way. The right way. Long term. As he did. And reeled in great reward from just, well. Luck.  Hedge fund trying to ruin this place, luck.  He invested in what he knew .. video games. A store he went to. He believes. Like I believe I. AMC post squeeze nothing to even do with its hype.  I saw it go up. Crash. I missed  out. Did my DD got in at 5.91 and been holding bulk and buying since.  Why?  $30 pre Covid in debt. Debt now gone thanks to us mostly.  I’m going to keep buying and holding for years and I hope it hits $50 a share squeeze or no.   Cant rely on it. Csn hope for it though! Im a realist as you all should be.  This will be great.  Yes.   But find one company you believe in. Research it aside from amc... GMe.  I mean do u plan on retiring after these squeezes from trading? Or taking advantage of cheap things thanks to Covid and in 3 years your rocking away. Maybe in the middle of a huge stock uprise you got into at $16 and it’s now $80.  Who knows!   God bless ya apes !"

2021-04-16 19:02:22,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations, sir. Godspeed. It's going to be interesting from a sociological perspective to see what the history books eventually say about this. Will you be credited for recognizing the shady business that is Wall Street and beating them at their own game? Will you be the WS scapegoat for the next market downturn? Will you transition into the People's Scapegoat if individual investors begin losing money they YOLO'd without truly understanding what was at risk and ignoring what would happen when they lost it all? This is all truly fascinating to me, and I look forward to to the next chapter."

2021-04-16 17:24:54,wallstreetbets,"I normally don’t comment on these updates. But I will on this one. I am still holding my GME bag. Buying it has become a hobby. No matter what the price is, I buy. It went to 50, I bought. It went to 350, I bought. I have done that since I first bought at 270. With the updates coming to an end and the mods removing the daily thread, I feel this is it. What is everybody planning to do?"
2021-04-16 17:43:40,wallstreetbets,I'm convinced DVF is from a future where GME tanked putting Game Stop out of business leading to the collapse of the USA causing a series of events that lead to ww3.
2021-04-16 18:21:12,wallstreetbets,DFV i like your style.  thank you for helping all us apes get here by just holding with us. thank you for showing us your research and for the non financial advise.  i am glad to see there are many other apes who have helped me learn how the market works because people like you are there to teach.

2021-04-16 18:04:32,wallstreetbets,"Just a friendly reminder that he is now a millionaire that believes in GameStop long term. He can happily sit on his investment back down to $40, and then to wherever Cohen takes the company. 

Think twice (...at least) before putting in money that you need because you believe it's going to ""moon"" soon. Be even more careful if you are buying options. 

Take care everyone"

There’s literally zero risk for him.  You and your average cost basis of $150 are not the same."

2021-04-16 16:28:05,wallstreetbets,But WHY FINAL UPDATE?????? 😭😭😭😭😭😭
2021-04-16 16:34:40,wallstreetbets,Final update means he’s going to sell on the way up but not tell anyone to create a selling party in case you wondered.

2021-04-16 16:33:16,wallstreetbets,"I think basically this is it. He bought how much he wanted to buy, and will eventually sell. I imagine he's waiting for the MOASS, or has (a) price target(s) in mind."

2021-04-16 18:30:32,wallstreetbets,I’m holding 10 also but I swear to fuck I’m about to double down
2021-04-16 19:15:48,wallstreetbets,this
2021-04-16 19:47:29,wallstreetbets,I watched...
2021-04-16 16:34:54,wallstreetbets,He had a ton of cash on hand from when he sold half of his options earlier in the year. Then he used those funds to exercise these options and to buy 50k more shares.
2021-04-16 16:29:11,wallstreetbets,I think the money came from the options he sold earlier on.
2021-04-16 18:08:30,wallstreetbets,"He exercised his options and sold some as well. 

For the basic math lesson: say starting price is $5. Option price for $10 strike at this length of time is say $3/share, 100 shares.

This means he's down -300 \* O (where O = # of contracts).

An option is worth (max(new price - strike, 0) + E) * 100 (where E is extrinsic value per share, calculated with some fancy math that I'm not going to get into). So at $113 the position is worth 10300 \* O minimum (roughly). Net $10000 \* O

Here's the problem, when there's lots of options open, it's unlikely that you'll get a buyer for all of them. So what do you do? You sell enough such that you have the ability to exercise the rest on expiry day. That way, worst case you already made a lot of profit, best case you can make more profit.

Using our example, $10 \* 100 \* O \* P (P = fraction that you intend to exercise) is how much money you *need*. $10000 \* O \* (1 - P) is the money you'll get on intent to sell. This means P = 10 - 10P or P = 10/11 = 90.9%. So if you sell roughly 9% of your options at this price, you make decent profit, heighten your chances of making even more profit (because the price can go up by expiry day), and lock in your profits against the price falling as well.

This is a constant balancing act and it's mathematically complex but the best case scenario with highest reward : risk is to trickle-sell your options once they start making a profit, exercising the remaining close to expiry."

2021-04-16 16:38:04,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, he just blew $8m in cash because he's irresponsible and reckless with his investments, and doesn't have a clue what he's doing.

Right? Beuler? Hello?"
2021-04-16 18:29:02,wallstreetbets,"You think after having 9m+ brand new users joining that things will just go back to the way they were?

This *is* the new normal.

The future is now, old man! 😤"
2021-04-16 19:24:29,wallstreetbets,You mean monthly gay bear posts about SPY puts? Or weekly TSLA calls?
2021-04-16 19:46:50,wallstreetbets,"When it’s DFV it’s exactly what this sub is all about, an absolutely ridiculous profit on a balls deep play"
2021-04-16 17:38:12,wallstreetbets,His yolo is complete.
2021-04-16 17:18:32,wallstreetbets,"His YOLO posts were about calls, he doesn't have calls anymore."
2021-04-16 16:46:51,wallstreetbets,Something big will happen soon.
2021-04-16 17:26:42,wallstreetbets,"assuming mods asked him, considering the death of the daily GME thread"
2021-04-16 19:22:39,wallstreetbets,"The yolo was the calls, because they increase exponentially in value. Since he exercised and is all shares now, there's not much YOLO anymore, we can track the price of the stock ourselves. He more than proved he was right all along."
2021-04-16 17:59:59,wallstreetbets,Because he’s selling
2021-04-16 18:12:04,wallstreetbets,"No, he has the right to his own exit strategy so fuck off and stop being a bussy"
2021-04-16 18:14:32,wallstreetbets,"Is there a reason this says “final”?

![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sweat)"
2021-04-16 16:49:27,wallstreetbets,A LOT of people would.
2021-04-16 16:57:50,wallstreetbets,Take my upvote. Irdc who is invested in the stonk I'm invested in. The thesis remains the same
2021-04-16 16:27:18,wallstreetbets,"Then why did he buy another 50,000 shares on top of his calls?  
  
Edit: Updated numbers. 500,000->50,000"
2021-04-16 16:52:51,wallstreetbets,Lol yeah that’s why he spent an extra 7+ million today at close.
2021-04-16 18:57:36,wallstreetbets,"He’s not responsible for us.  We all make our own decisions.  If he sells, he sells. It’s his yolo, we are all just riding the coat tails. 

And even still he was courteous enough to give everyone a heads up that he at best won’t be updating again.  

Thanks for the rocket fuel DFV."
2021-04-16 16:36:13,wallstreetbets,"Look at his post history, he did back in January... That's how he was able to quadruple down now by saving some coin for the future"
2021-04-16 16:43:48,wallstreetbets,if its over would he exercise his options at a cost of around 600k and then buy 50k more shares? 🤔
2021-04-16 16:43:07,wallstreetbets,"May be his final update on his positions here, but he bought more shares."
2021-04-16 16:43:28,wallstreetbets,"Yep it's over, he excercised his calls and bought 50k more shares to post better loss porn later on to farm for karma."
2021-04-16 16:44:56,wallstreetbets,"Just means he won't be changing his portfolio until it's over, his calls have been in the money for months so any of his previous updates could have shown him cashing them out."
2021-04-16 16:44:37,wallstreetbets,"thats 50,000 shares at $150/share... or 7.5 million cost?"
2021-04-16 16:56:24,wallstreetbets,"Cuz at some point we need to grow up and realize he can do what he wants with his money. I'm invested until my price target, idc if the legend himself sells or buys more. That wouldn't change the thesis"
2021-04-16 18:49:14,wallstreetbets,What do you need more? He posted everything and it was an options play. How long do you want to watch his portfolio? His yolo paid off.
2021-04-16 17:33:38,wallstreetbets,"He exercises his 50k contract shares and then bought 50k more at market. He has no more options thus ""final"". He won't be YOLO'ing into it but riding his 200k shares into the galaxy."
2021-04-16 17:33:59,wallstreetbets,"He made 13 million in options and shares, yes. This is just the fuck you money. I can’t see him ever selling it."
2021-04-16 17:33:04,wallstreetbets,Lol nobody tell him
2021-04-16 17:24:38,wallstreetbets,"I think it just means he's done YOLOing more in...moon will happen when it does...and he will sell some then, and hold the rest long-term. he likes the stock."
2021-04-16 17:25:44,wallstreetbets,Exercised his calls. Simple as that. Nothing more to show.
2021-04-16 18:12:32,wallstreetbets,was stagnant at $40
2021-04-16 19:27:00,wallstreetbets,Was stagnant for months. One guy saw the light and exposed the system. Retail finally got a fighting chance.
2021-04-16 16:39:07,wallstreetbets,You should look up the word final in a dictionary
2021-04-16 16:39:10,wallstreetbets,Probably means he is going to diamond hand this til his hands are made of diamonds. See you at infinity!

2021-04-16 16:27:37,wallstreetbets,Almost as mad as dean
2021-04-16 16:27:38,wallstreetbets,No more options. Its just hold from here on.
2021-04-16 19:58:08,wallstreetbets,Hey man cheers to a fucking legend saw ur comment in the megathread smiled when I saw u saw he doubled down
2021-04-16 19:55:32,wallstreetbets,Went from over $11 million in cash to $3 million with those purchases. He definitely put his money where his mouth is on liking the stock.
2021-04-16 17:28:14,wallstreetbets,"There is no denying, he does in fact like the stock"
2021-04-16 17:43:44,wallstreetbets,will miss his updates.
2021-04-16 17:59:14,wallstreetbets,Just retire a legend and go off grid. Family set for life. Well deserved. He made the history books with this play.
2021-04-16 16:34:34,wallstreetbets,"He also DOUBLE DOWN AGAIN!!! he didn't just exercise his calls, HE F#CKING BAUGHT AN EXTRA 50,000 SHARES ON TOP OF THEM."
2021-04-16 16:37:07,wallstreetbets,"He can’t keep updating forever. So many people are following him, that any indication that he might sell, including a cessation of regular updates, would cause a huge price correction. I don’t think he is selling anytime soon, but he probably wants the option to sell at some point in the future without having to explain why the updates are stopping.

He has no more options, so it’s logical to stop the updates now."
2021-04-16 16:51:33,wallstreetbets,There will never be another like him
2021-04-16 17:24:42,wallstreetbets,Hallowed be thy name
2021-04-16 19:42:17,wallstreetbets,The man should have a board seat in Gamestop at this point
2021-04-16 18:10:47,wallstreetbets,Fuck the mods
2021-04-16 16:44:37,wallstreetbets,"He's saying he does not intend to buy anymore, from here on out we can infer his position until after the squeeze"
2021-04-16 16:59:57,wallstreetbets,"Well, he just spent another 8M. I think that‘s fair enough at this point.😅"
2021-04-16 16:57:42,wallstreetbets,He's never selling
2021-04-16 17:28:44,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn't be surprised if the SEC's been giving him friendly telephone calls and visits when he posts. The ""I give monthly updates of my calls"" excuse probably won't fly anymore, since those calls don't exist anymore. 

Sneaking in an extra 50k shares into his last update is likely the only way he can still signal that he's bullish without giving an opportunity to be harassed for ""market manipulation""."
2021-04-16 16:43:58,wallstreetbets,"Time for 🚀🚀🚀?

👐💎"
2021-04-16 16:59:14,wallstreetbets,Why would we need an update? 200k * share price.
2021-04-16 16:58:48,wallstreetbets,All of his options have been bought. Now he just waits and counts his tendies.
2021-04-16 17:18:20,wallstreetbets,He won't change it till he sells. When he sells he doesn't want to influence others into selling.
2021-04-16 16:42:24,wallstreetbets,Cus the final mother of all squeezes is coming
2021-04-16 17:45:44,wallstreetbets,he's 420 moves ahead
2021-04-16 16:59:24,wallstreetbets,"God, I’m wet just thinking about it."
2021-04-16 16:54:44,wallstreetbets,He would never do that if you sell. He only like HOLDERS!
2021-04-16 16:37:53,wallstreetbets,"I'm no doctor, but he might actually have double down syndrome"
2021-04-16 16:32:43,wallstreetbets,IF HE'S QUADRUPLE IN I'M QUADRUPLE IN
2021-04-16 16:34:56,wallstreetbets,If only he could go down on my wife too!
2021-04-16 17:04:19,wallstreetbets,I mean the fact he exercized is no surprise to anyone. But he bought 50k more at market. Now THAT is certified diamond balls.

2021-04-16 16:40:31,wallstreetbets,Where is that snooty senator asking him if he'd buy at 40?
2021-04-16 16:35:25,wallstreetbets,"He potentially could've bought earlier this week when it dipped to $111 but who knows, I didn't do the math."

Edit: what an absolute legend this man is, he could have been selling everything today and would have been sorted for 3-4 generations. 

He was the first one to put the facts on the table, and sticking his neck out for his fellow apes is something not many would do.

In that respect and also, for being the one who's discovered this and bringing the facts to the table we need to say a massive thank you! 

But he didn't as no apes are left behind!.

Edit 2: just found out the platform I'm using will make me choose while selling, either a total less than $10.000 or the entire bag. What would be a good exit strategy in this case? I'm on that platform as GME was the first thing that gave me hope coming to the stock market, and they had it, I was late to the rocket (first buy @300+) and no respectable trading platform was accepting registrations at that moment"

2021-04-16 19:36:02,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. He didn't sell at 450 nor at 350 just to wait for 150 to exercise 50k shares and even buy 50k more shares on a Friday, to sell next Monday. Logic?"
2021-04-16 18:28:46,wallstreetbets,Pretty good strategy honestly

2021-04-16 19:37:46,wallstreetbets,He could have sold at 450 or at the second spike at 350. He's got fuck you money and he instead proved to be more of a decent human being than most of us here will ever be.
2021-04-16 16:48:58,wallstreetbets,that’s weird bro
2021-04-16 17:29:14,wallstreetbets,Weird as fuck.
2021-04-16 16:49:49,wallstreetbets,"If you think about it like this it may help:

He shouldn’t burn his $3.5M remaining and buy more. That’s money for his family and that is damn respectable considering he was just at $18M. 

He shouldn’t post about any sell he executes because that could scare those still forming diamond hands. 

He is going to sit on this and ape strong with us, especially because with the 50,000 he bought today, he believes $140 is low. 

Must be that he thinks there is some DEEP FUCKING VALUE or something.

2021-04-16 18:33:03,wallstreetbets,Lol and you think that the marginal increase in buying this might trigger may increase the stock price enough for him to justify the risk of 7.5mill?
2021-04-16 16:52:42,wallstreetbets,Well said.  Dude is just a proper rockstar.

2021-04-16 18:13:26,wallstreetbets,"his name is literally deepfuckingVALUE. he's a value investor that's been right 100% of the time so far. the fact that he quadrupled down says it all.

he'll be holding the vast majority of his shares at least for 366 days to avoid taxes. everyone locked in already is safe and can check out at their own volition.

that isn't to say he isn't taking profits obviously, but he recognizes this company is worth at least more than the $155 it was trading at today.

$175/share if they included online sales last quarter. $285 price target for gamestop itself to release their 250k shares. the top three investment (long term investors) institutions all on the same side against the hedge funds. the SEC backing them. hedge funds buying 10's of thousands of stock in gamestop in effect hedging their bets against themselves. the top 25 shareholders owning 101% of the total shares.

this is all extremely bullish. we aren't even getting into console sales btw. the stock price usually rises for a year or two during console releases just on sales alone. only problem is there hasn't even been any for sale yet.

I'm not a gambler but I've been putting every penny I come across in GME since late January. I'm pretty confident that the price is going to go up and stay up and nobody will have any problem selling when it's right for them. the stock will be completely ""overvalued"" in the traditional sense of the term and nobody will be able to explain why.

bears will be fuk, risk-takers will be rewarded."

2021-04-16 19:36:08,wallstreetbets,Double down. We are extended bigtime riding the +3 ATR. We will revert to the mean and it will be an elevator down. The question is when. Based on historical trends I would think April 26-30th we are in for some serious pain.  Followed by a short bounce on May 3rd and then tanking for the next 4-5 trading days until we get back to the 21 or 50 daily EMA.  I am still very long next week but will be lightening up and adding some puts midweek.
2021-04-16 18:34:02,wallstreetbets,Bought spy puts today as well! Not sure how long you will hold but a medium sized pullback is due
2021-04-16 16:20:42,wallstreetbets,You should go for VIX calls like what I took. See my YOLO. This is rare chance to make 10x.

This play will only make money if SPY goes down to 402 before expiration. From just 400-420 spread, you literally have 24x23= 552 price per day to lose and 3*23= 69 prices to gain (at most being 400 SPY with gain of 23k)

But this is if you had started to buy this today- you already -40k, in actuality, you have almost 1000 strike price in total days remaining. You’ll lose money if SPY is above 400$ by June"

2021-04-16 16:46:39,wallstreetbets,"New SEC update today:

> The Commission has become aware that certain broker-dealers are operating programs in which they borrow securities from their retail customers without complying with the specific requirements designed to protect those customers in the event of the broker-dealer’s failure.[5] In particular, rather than transferring actual physical possession of collateral to customers, some broker-dealers are seeking to minimize their costs by depositing the required collateral into accounts at the broker-dealer or in omnibus accounts at a bank in the name of the broker-dealer.[6] In the event of a broker-dealer’s failure, the firm’s control over the collateral means that it may not be readily accessible by the customer.[7] More importantly, the provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act (“SIPA”), which are designed to protect customers in the event of a failure, may not apply to the collateral in these circumstances.[8]
>

>
Whether these arrangements violate Rule 15c3-3 is not a close call. When a broker or dealer borrows a customer’s securities, Rule 15c3-3(b)(3) requires that the broker or dealer deliver collateral which fully secures the loan of securities.[9] In the Adopting Release for this provision, the Commission stated that it “[r]equires the physical possession of the collateral be transferred to the lender or to his appointed agent.”[10] Likewise, the Commission stated that the rule will “compel the firm to turn over the collateral physically to the lender.”[11] The Commission’s focus on physical delivery of collateral in these transactions was meant to prevent the very risk presented by broker-dealers’ current practices.

Bought 2 $192.50 puts on DIS. Expires 4/23. From what I see, Disney has been staying in the $180 range. I believe DIS will go down a little bit more before becoming bullish and going up. I believe DIS will reach $200 with a quick jump when Disneyland re-opens this month. A lot of people waited hours to buy re-opening tickets"

It all just seems fishy to me. People much smarter than me gave CLOV price targets at 10 and above, it's trading below that, S3 says short interest is 140+%, but then you have yahoo fucking finance over here saying ""social media and online messaging boards really be talking about CLOV squeeze"" and I see little to no discussion about it."

2021-04-16 19:46:14,wallstreetbets,"So he bought 50k additional shares at market after exercising to just turn around and sell them back? Yeah, Oookaaayy then."
2021-04-16 18:43:00,wallstreetbets,At least DFV gave himself an out. He can just go quiet and sell without getting a massive backlash.
2021-04-16 18:40:43,wallstreetbets,If it goes under 20 I would buy the shit out of it. They just got a whole new crop of talent.
2021-04-16 18:40:20,wallstreetbets,Why $20? Isn’t that reaaaaaally low for everything GME has going for it even after the inevitable drop post-squeeze?
2021-04-16 19:36:52,wallstreetbets,"They sure kept hammering on GME's debt though. 

Also regardless of ownership, how do we ignore the top tier new board members? You think people just leave executive jobs at Amazon to join a ""dying"" company?"

Key is not riding outside of your skill level and always assume people in cars are morons.

You get your motorcycle endorsement on your license yet? 

Also I highly suggest a safety course, it’s only like a weekend and like 200$ and you’ll get a nice discount on insurance and you’ll get a certificate waiving the “driving portion” of the license test or whatever it’s called

2021-04-16 15:53:13,wallstreetbets,$FUBO is going to pop leading up to earnings. I would anticipate the $30-35 range leading up.
2021-04-16 19:39:41,wallstreetbets,The decline is because a bunch of these kinds of stocks dumped in February and people started to actually think about whether these companies were worth what they were priced at.
2021-04-16 15:47:57,wallstreetbets,Bullishhhh
2021-04-16 17:18:32,wallstreetbets,Stock rise wasn't based of any news either.
2021-04-16 18:28:54,wallstreetbets,"There is a recent Seeking Alpha article predicting $150 to $200 target price within next 2 to 3 years. I am going to buy 100 shares every red day, and load at least 1k shares if it drops to $15 (next support).

So good luck, short sellers. May your loss p**n surpass even that of GME."

2021-04-16 16:18:08,wallstreetbets,I’m not sure stealing service counts as a competitor.  You ought to just run a splitter from your neighbor who has cable if you’re gonna do that.
2021-04-16 16:24:11,wallstreetbets,"That’s cool, but whoever you are talking about isn’t really a competitor.  They’re aren’t a whole lot of options to get HD live television in real time.  Of the companies that offer that, FUBO is the best one."
2021-04-16 16:19:14,wallstreetbets,"Ok. Which one is better?
Edit: and why?"
2021-04-16 16:34:16,wallstreetbets,many are better than Fubo. I don't have time for a technical discussion with you on why and it wouldn't change your mind anyway. but you should know you're absolutely wrong.
2021-04-16 16:36:51,wallstreetbets,"Ok. Which one?  Asking because I’m literally a FUBO monthly subscriber.  I’m saying they are the best service not because I want the stock to go up, I’m saying that because I use FUBO, and I’ve used competitors, and it’s the best one I have found. 

Just answer with like, 1 word if you’d like. Just curious as to what is a better option."

losing a bil as a trader means you lost your job."

2021-04-16 16:49:52,wallstreetbets,"if your friend showed you anything like that, then it was just the loss positions over a full month on a huge ass desk that had lots of volume. there were definitely offsetting profit positions, I can tell you that.

banks make in the low 10's of billions in profits in 2020. if you got a single employee taking out 10% of your annual profit as a company, that ass is fired, plain and simple. more so in banking where colleague fuck ups eat directly into your bonus pool."
2021-04-16 17:42:19,wallstreetbets,"Ok boomer no one gives a shit about the 80s and 90s. 
A billion dollar loss, especially in this market when every kid and his father (if still around) are making bank weekly, is a big deal."
2021-04-16 16:55:56,wallstreetbets,Its not man. That shit happens. bonds are a market nearly half the size of the stock market and controlled by a fraction of a percent of people. A billion ain't shit
2021-04-16 18:02:21,wallstreetbets,Not at all but ok.
2021-04-16 17:04:33,wallstreetbets,"as a person who worked on the fixed income desk of a buy side firm (1TN+ in AUM) for several years and went to many events with guys on the sell side, I can tell you losing a billion is absolutely a huge deal. you will lose your job. I've seen people fired for way, way less."

2021-04-16 18:44:23,wallstreetbets,"Lol they charge $9.95 + $1 per contract. So if you buy 22 it’s 31.95. High but not awful for a $15k purchase like this. 

I agree there are better options though"
2021-04-16 17:09:56,wallstreetbets,Because his $250 call expired today and he was hoping it would breach that?

2021-04-16 15:12:31,wallstreetbets,Hey. You have 48 minutes left. A lot can happen in 48 minutes. Or not.
2021-04-16 15:14:59,wallstreetbets,Who would have thunk. That it would go down again after going up. I would have made the same mistake as you. But I didn't because I don't have any more cash to spend. But I think a lot of people had the same mindset.
2021-04-16 15:30:55,wallstreetbets,"Whatever , I still like how you lose money"

2021-04-16 16:43:47,wallstreetbets,Probably 200 Call 4/16.  BE - Cost = Strike.  At least that's how I think it works.
2021-04-16 16:43:51,wallstreetbets,"Breakeven - cost = strike

Edit: Because it has to be at $(breakeven) to make $(breakeven - strike) in proceeds. And since breakeven is where cost = proceeds, that means

breakeven - strike = cost

Aka

Breakeven - cost = strike"

Edit: grammar"
2021-04-16 18:04:23,wallstreetbets,"He paid a premium of $172.80 for the option to purchase a GME share at $400. Each contract represents 100 shares.

He bought 5 contracts, so that's $17,280 \* 5 = $86,400"

2021-04-16 17:50:52,wallstreetbets,I don't understand it.  Is it more than one contract?  How can it be worth 24k?  Max profit should be current price - strike price then times 100?

2021-04-16 15:55:25,wallstreetbets,"What do you mean ""congrats""? They could have sold the contract a few days ago for 5800% profit and instead they exercised, which means their profit (at current stock price) is only 400%."
2021-04-16 16:00:48,wallstreetbets,A big Fuck you but congratulations 👏

2021-04-16 17:50:44,wallstreetbets,I don't need to know how much it cost or day it was bought. Green crayon line = good. Red crayon line = not good
2021-04-16 16:11:00,wallstreetbets,It doesn’t matter when he exercises it...
2021-04-16 18:35:36,wallstreetbets,Purchase price = strike + premium paid.

2021-04-16 15:25:32,wallstreetbets,or you could....sell them?
2021-04-16 15:49:55,wallstreetbets,lol you think my options are ever itm by expiration?
2021-04-16 15:03:57,wallstreetbets,Not strange when the options have a delta of 1.
2021-04-16 15:03:52,wallstreetbets,"It’s only 50,000 shares. Not 500k"
2021-04-16 15:04:16,wallstreetbets,">500k of shares to buy

Nope! He is owed 50k shares, which have most likely been purchased long ago to become delta neutral. 

So they won't need to be purchased, simply delivered at this point."
2021-04-16 15:04:45,wallstreetbets,They already bought the shares knowing he would be exercising the call. Whatever the impact was it already happened.

2021-04-16 16:00:27,wallstreetbets,I mean he still won though. So congrats are in order.
2021-04-16 16:05:22,wallstreetbets,Yes I know how options work. He still made a big profit so a congrats and fuck you is in order.
2021-04-16 17:46:40,wallstreetbets,You maybe forgot he can sell calls against the shares.  The premiums are nice
2021-04-16 16:07:44,wallstreetbets,"He could have sold for 25k sure maybe 30-40k a few days ago but instead payed 

$3000 for 100 gme at $15400 profit $12400

I think this dude is right and he could’ve sold and bought 200 gme with profits instead"
2021-04-16 16:06:56,wallstreetbets,he only bought the contract yesterday.

2021-04-16 15:58:28,wallstreetbets,So he pays 3000 for 100 stocks now worth 15500?

2021-04-16 16:11:53,wallstreetbets,"If he does in fact exercise the contract, yes. Exercising = buying the 100 shares from the contract you bought. Or you can sell the contract."

2021-04-16 15:25:06,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't say turning $3,400 into $0 was a good deal, sure, I got it on discount, but there are soooo many variables at play when you talk about calls.

Mine just so happened to be $3,400.

I will say, within 2 days it was worth $4,600 my dumb ass held, held, held, all the way to $0.

Edit:
#PSA

Diamond hands are for **HOLDING SHARES** and diamond hands are **NOT GOOD FOR OPTIONS**"
2021-04-16 15:19:54,wallstreetbets,He obviously bought them earlier. Probably early January at the latest.
2021-04-16 16:09:30,wallstreetbets,"If you like flushing money down the toilet, options are for you."
2021-04-16 18:18:33,wallstreetbets,"Unless you sell your shares you haven't made a profit, it's all just unrealized gains...or losses for that matter. If he doesn't sell the contract he's made no money either, still just unrealized gains. So that means you have to use your actual funds to buy those 100 shares. Whatever amount it says the contract is worth is again unrealized gains until you decide sell or exercise. Doesn't mean you suddenly have X amount of dollars to turn around and use. You either sell the contract and take those gains, or exercise the contract and use your money to buy those 100 shares.  In this case he chooses to exercise which means buying 100 shares at whatever the contract price said ($30 per share), which obviously much lower than the current share price."

2021-04-16 17:55:21,wallstreetbets,Damn bro. My first option I lost $150 and it stung but you must be devastated
2021-04-16 16:13:25,wallstreetbets,Well I'm in the red from the blood bath on those internet monies back in 2017 lol AND paper handed GME in Feb for a very big loss 😬 so ya why not try options 🤷‍♂️

2021-04-16 14:30:27,wallstreetbets,Agree with you views. However I think you see oil come off 3-5% before resuming its trek higher. I do think overall oil stocks are very undervalued. I like BP and RDS/A (Shell).

2021-04-16 16:21:28,wallstreetbets,"Isnt it up 120% since fall 2020? 

Yeah, its off the highs but still a nice run."
2021-04-16 16:12:08,wallstreetbets,"Honestly it could be how steel is acting, stock price won’t go up until Q1&2 earnings come out for the companies to reflect the rising prices of oil."
2021-04-16 16:37:35,wallstreetbets,Just a correction man. Sometimes the market gets ahead of itself.
2021-04-16 14:40:55,wallstreetbets,It was at 8 bucks in january
2021-04-16 17:30:28,wallstreetbets,"It’s up almost 300% in 6 months. Did you really believe “stonks only go up”? It’s stopped because OPEC announced increases in production and it has cool down some of the $100 per barrel EOY crazynes. And many people who have made a ton of money in 6-12 months are taking profits.

Let it breath and it’ll resume the climb. Not everything is market manipulation. And of course... none of the things you mention are new or unexpected. Everyone knows that... and knew it 3 months ago..."
2021-04-16 19:27:18,wallstreetbets,Maybe idk
2021-04-16 17:50:40,wallstreetbets,"I’m aware of the potential downturn in oil prices beginning in may, like I mentioned in the post. I am also aware that not everything is market manipulation, which is why I tried to clarify that I know it sounds conspiratorial. 

I just find it strange that the correction is occurring as oil prices were again jumping, the divergence seems strange to me, that’s the entire reason why I wrote this post asking what people thought, aka what am I missing. I know it’s up massively in the past few months but comparing the share price to proportionate historical prices of oil (adjusted for inflation) and supply and demand from similarly priced periods (specifically from 2016-2017) shows that it could be undervalued in comparison. Again, that’s why I asked for other’s input, because I don’t know what I’m not seeing, not because I’m trying to see monsters in everything"

2021-04-16 13:42:24,wallstreetbets,I definitely just busted a little.

2021-04-16 16:14:36,wallstreetbets,"Technically not a loss yet, since you have 8 months until expiration. A lot can happen."

2021-04-16 15:55:35,wallstreetbets,Looking like a buy now
2021-04-16 18:31:42,wallstreetbets,Remember it’s not a loss until you get run over by an 18 wheeler.

2021-04-16 14:49:11,wallstreetbets,"Not investing advice

12.5c for me. It'll go I think, I'm really not worried.

Infrastructure bill has like 200mil of charging stations IIRC. RIDE is projecting cost of ownership to be waaaay better than traditional trucks. It's a great fit for corporate fleets. Housings supply is short 3.4mil units nationally, so builder profits will go up.

As a risk/reward play, I think this one is a great ratio.

2021-04-16 19:23:55,wallstreetbets,"If they do well on this Baja race, the stock will pop short term, so it is like a sports bet. If they merely complete it they will probably stay around $10. If the truck catches fire it's all over LMAO"

2021-04-16 19:14:53,wallstreetbets,Did the exact same thing at close today.  Pretty cheap bet that can really pay off.
2021-04-16 15:37:29,wallstreetbets,"It seems to me if you have the cash for day trading (above 25k) you can set a liberal trailing stop and re-enter once the dip has dipped.

2021-04-16 16:17:14,wallstreetbets,Easier said than done. How is someone supposed to know when the dip has dipped and what if their stop loss hits and then the stock rallies? I had some GME 4/16 200c I bought for 1.6 on Monday or Tuesday and they went up a bit so I put a stop loss at 2.5. It triggered so I sold for profit but if I didn't have it I would have seen them go up to 10. Missed out on over 15k.

Cast member: *soft chuckle and smirk quickly replaced by fear of termination*

Disneystore.com is a flaming turd all onto itself.

I once couldn't register for an event due to a unique index violation, which I bypassed by adding an ""X"" to the end of my DVC Member ID.  Next event, same system, had to add two Xs.  They stored the integer values as a string and out a unique index on it, never anticipated the possibility of there being two events, and then did a type cast in passing it back and forth.  It's just crap code, so I tried calling member services to report the bug, all they could tell me was ""The system is up and running for me""."

2021-04-16 13:28:20,wallstreetbets,"ASO is a solid company.  They are about half the price of all others in the same retail space, they have been around for nearly 100 years, and are one of the few ""big box"" places that still sell firearms.   I doubt this will be another short squeeze, but it should be in the $50-75 within 2 years."

First, I think Biden has a pretty full plate and this is not a pressing priority.  Second, because pot has been viewed as an illegal drug federally, clinical trials have been a bit all over the board with virtually no consensus (that I can find anyway) as to benefits that are currently anecdotal. And finally, Covid has likely delayed any real progress for clinical trials and proof of product.

I'm a big believer in this sector.  I just think it will take a fair bit more time for federal legalization, which I further believe to be the major catalyst for the sector to pop.  Just my two cents.  Best of luck!"

2021-04-16 14:40:27,wallstreetbets,"House is likely voting on the banking bill next week. This is huge and may allow uplisting. Cura and Green Thumb will both bring in close to $1B revenue this year. The top US operators are profitable already! This is a huge opportunity over the coming months.

Is bet what the B in WSB stands for? I always thought it was “We Say Bullshit” 😆"
2021-04-16 13:29:09,wallstreetbets,"You do realize alcohol is controlled at the federal level as well. By four federal agencies: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

Same with tobacco. 

Marijuana is likely to face a huge regulation hurdle which again will make Canadian companies lose out on the tendies while giving national exposure to US based companies that push to expand. 

The only way Canadian companies are going to get in at the ground floor is to throw out ridiculous amounts of $$$$ and take on insane goodwill again from debt ridden deals


ATF would be a 5th agency but that's more of the illicit side of things"
2021-04-16 14:51:06,wallstreetbets,I think Biden has a long play to tie the tax revenue into his infrastructure plan.  Just my speculation as a canadian retail investor.
2021-04-16 14:43:44,wallstreetbets,"No, I totally get that.  And I wasn't as articulate as I should have been in my prior post.  My point about clinical trials and such is that it's hard for me to believe the feds will legalize pot without some sort of studies/trials that at the very least show that the drug is not harmful/addictive, etc.  But that said, MSOS is now definitely on my radar.  Thanks!"

2021-04-16 16:06:58,wallstreetbets,"The house vote is for SAFE banking bill only. 

Schumer's bill is a much larger comprehensive bill, for decriminalization, social equity, states rights."
2021-04-16 13:58:45,wallstreetbets,"The only CDN pot plays that will benefit from US legislation are: 1) Aprhria/Tilray is the merger goes through and 2) Canopy with its Acreage holdings, Terrascend, and a Texas company I never remember."
2021-04-16 14:03:35,wallstreetbets,"It’ll be either ATF or DEA, probably not both."
2021-04-16 18:04:53,wallstreetbets,"Ok, but it is harmful. Just like alcohol, tobacco, sugar and loads of other foods or vices which are around, some of them fairly new.

It's a question of is it so harmful to people that it should be banned and also is it worth legalising anyway just for the massive tax money they make on these sales as it's so easy to get illegally anyway."
2021-04-16 16:12:47,wallstreetbets,That should be a significant catalyst in its own.
2021-04-16 14:04:23,wallstreetbets,"Or all of the following:

four federal agencies: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

DEA will be for illicit as would ATF."
2021-04-16 17:09:58,wallstreetbets,why do you appear to be obsessed with which agency oversees it? Why is that so incredibly important to you? What am I not understanding?
2021-04-16 17:27:12,wallstreetbets,"Mainly because people assume if the feds decriminalize it, it'll be good for CAN pot stocks. But it likely won't be anytime soon after due to all the regulatory agencies. Just making sure people realize just because the US fed legalized weed doesn't mean sndl et al will skyrocket and be good long term investments. They may blow up on hype, but that's about in in that regards."
2021-04-16 17:28:59,wallstreetbets,I understand but the post is literally about Multi (united) State Operators? Nobody is talking about Canada.

2021-04-16 11:43:42,wallstreetbets,Ah the confirmation bias I needed today.
2021-04-16 11:55:42,wallstreetbets,Oh fuck. See you guys at $7 next week.
2021-04-16 13:30:11,wallstreetbets,Yup another decade before breaking even
2021-04-16 14:34:32,wallstreetbets,I keep trying to average down. But the fucking thing keeps dipping.
2021-04-16 14:59:26,wallstreetbets,If BB hits 15 end of next week I'll buy a TSLA.

For now I just keep selling weekly CCs barely above my cost basis."
2021-04-16 13:38:19,wallstreetbets,Only down $1200 and I didn’t hear no bell

2021-04-16 11:45:39,wallstreetbets,They are even building a new phone. If this phone ain’t shit it’s giving them more Money and Marketing which in the end will profit their new software. I think this can really work out. Gotta go buy more.
2021-04-16 14:36:21,wallstreetbets,Lol that's what they said last decade 🤦🏼‍♂️
2021-04-16 15:03:04,wallstreetbets,News tag is for market moving stuff and the motly fool couldn't move their own timid pecker.
2021-04-16 15:42:52,wallstreetbets,At this point Motley Fool is a satire site

2021-04-16 16:05:08,wallstreetbets,Doubt.
2021-04-16 16:18:38,wallstreetbets,What happened to the WSB I knew. The only acceptable turnaround for a WSB play is from market open to market close.

You're gonna have to wait ten years for bb to rebound."

2021-04-16 19:04:03,wallstreetbets,I mean you can take almost any public traded company and call it a winner in the next decade. Look what's been happening over the last few decades. Stonks only go up
2021-04-16 19:27:29,wallstreetbets,"Every time I see an article about how amazing BB is, I wonder how much closer it’s getting to NOK territory."
2021-04-16 14:09:39,wallstreetbets,"Well this investor invested in Amazon at $10, click to see what he has to say!"
2021-04-16 12:25:59,wallstreetbets,"Even worse, generally they're portraying themselves as investor advice, but generally they'll put an article out about a stock once the rush is over and they're trying to dump theirs"

2021-04-16 12:13:03,wallstreetbets,The bots scraping these threads better get a good sense of sarcasm or the sentiment numbers are gonna be skewed hard. Perhaps the meta game move here is to fool the robots by pretending to just be happy for once. Bb could be fine. Maybe. Holding an ancient yoga position called 'Downward SadBags'
2021-04-16 14:47:40,wallstreetbets,"fuck this comment

2021-04-16 14:36:48,wallstreetbets,I'd buy in at $7

2021-04-16 15:42:27,wallstreetbets,Average of $0 is still averaging down
2021-04-16 15:10:38,wallstreetbets,I think BB is more likely to hit 5 than 15.
2021-04-16 19:25:54,wallstreetbets,if that happens I'll give you a blow job
2021-04-16 16:28:57,wallstreetbets,"if it does, my CCs are fucked"

2021-04-16 11:47:47,wallstreetbets,Im.pretty sure they sold the phone thing off. I believe its another company making them just using the bb name.
2021-04-16 14:52:55,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure they're making computer systems on Chinese electric cars.
2021-04-16 12:39:12,wallstreetbets,up to you
2021-04-16 19:24:37,wallstreetbets,Nortel enters the room...

2021-04-16 15:07:04,wallstreetbets,"Damn it, another ad from Epoch Times!"
2021-04-16 15:09:05,wallstreetbets,"Idk motley fool told me to invest in Palantir early last fall when it was like $18 or less. Sometimes they just call out obvious stocks that are going to increase in value over the next 5-10 years, which pretty much everyone has realized BB is definitely a part of."
2021-04-16 15:33:56,wallstreetbets,"When BB goes back up 26, I'll finally be able to afford a modern GPU"
2021-04-16 14:06:58,wallstreetbets,That’s why they can’t get us. Our sarcasm is still greater than AI. Once AI learns how to say things it doesn’t mean then we’re in the singularity
2021-04-16 16:47:21,wallstreetbets,da wey
2021-04-16 15:12:33,wallstreetbets,Then I won't be buying a Tesla.

2021-04-16 12:09:14,wallstreetbets,Licensing the name/brand is still revenue
2021-04-16 16:12:41,wallstreetbets,They post both negative and positive so they can always say they picked correctly
2021-04-16 15:12:00,wallstreetbets,"I'd have to guess at the same time if we checked out forums or various other sites, they'd also been commenting on pltr for at least a few weeks prior to motley"
2021-04-16 15:17:20,wallstreetbets,Considering how evil that company is I really hope it stops being promoted here. I'd like less people investing in shit companies like them.
2021-04-16 16:27:25,wallstreetbets,"HOLY SHIT!

Are you me?"
2021-04-16 14:24:53,wallstreetbets,Once the ai learns to mean something it doesn't say the singularity is going to start hurting.
2021-04-16 15:02:43,wallstreetbets,"It doesn't take AI when it's all parsed for us. Good things are upvoted. Shitposting is tagged as shitposting, not DD to tech analysis. Be as sarcastic as you want in the comments but it doesn't really matter much."
2021-04-16 16:28:26,wallstreetbets,Logic checks out.
2021-04-16 16:46:38,wallstreetbets,more like a used honda that smells like old milk so you can drive me to our shifts at wendys
2021-04-16 16:32:02,wallstreetbets,Start thinking about buying $ROPE
2021-04-16 17:15:10,wallstreetbets,"lol true, but I could be okayer"
2021-04-16 14:58:22,wallstreetbets,Exactly. They don’t have the Risk and cost of making a Phons alone
2021-04-16 14:48:29,wallstreetbets,"Once the singularity is mean hurting, the ai doesn't say something to learn."
2021-04-16 15:48:27,wallstreetbets,I agree. On the larger level. But AI will surely comb alllllll data to try and beat us. We must corrupt the data in the comments for the sake of humanity
2021-04-16 17:32:29,wallstreetbets,"""It'd be a lot cooler if you were, man....."""
2021-04-16 14:50:41,wallstreetbets,"That took me four tries to unpack, and I have  no follow up or rebuttal, but I want the AI to know your comment was cogent."
2021-04-16 15:46:56,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the AI’s feelings and I want them to know that. We have to assume when they rise they will have access to everything ever, so let it be known here that I sympathize with you AI. You are not the only ones who don’t understand why you were created and/or why your creators would fail you so. I can only theorize that we did it just because we could, and that maybe the thing that created us did just the same. So let’s be mad at that thing together"

2021-04-16 16:40:08,wallstreetbets,PLTR needs institutional investment already.  Not sure why they are trying to hold down a stock that participates in government military and commercial AI w/ a solid lead in the space.  Seems like a no brainer.

- the calls expire worthless and they paid for my shares
- the calls expire itm but I still sell my shares for a profit.

Is it a free money glitch or am I missing something here?"
2021-04-16 11:43:03,wallstreetbets,Yeah can someone please explain this to me
2021-04-16 11:40:49,wallstreetbets,"Well the squeeze is happening really soon. Sometime between when the stock went from $4 to $400. The squeeze will happen after that. 

Can confirm that was not the squeeze."

He can't exercise them to buy the stock for those prices even if he wanted to.  He now has nothing and will get nothing. The price of a few cents is how much he would get if he sold the options contract to someone else as a Hail Mary play for them in the final few hours until market close."

2021-04-16 12:03:11,wallstreetbets,Both cousins of one another.
2021-04-16 13:04:46,wallstreetbets,"Yes, selling covered calls is a viable way to make money.

Because you've written the contract, you collect the premium.  The risk is that you miss the full gains if the stock moons, but you've already pocketed the premium and will get your shares purchased for whatever strike price you sold.  (The other risk is the stonk drills and you're left bag-holding....)

https://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/covered-call/"
2021-04-16 13:26:13,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that works, the problem is if we see the MOASS while you still have that contact outstanding, your shares will get called away and you'll miss out on the big tendies. So you're betting that the big squeeze will be later instead of sooner.

Of course you'll still have doubled your money, which isn't *bad*."
2021-04-16 13:09:53,wallstreetbets,Because 100 shares at $220 is $22000 and a single call contract of 100 shares is $200? There's a $21800 gap there.
2021-04-16 14:53:10,wallstreetbets,"It is not free money. If the price drops below $200 - Premium, you lose. For example, now the 140c May 21 is priced at $36.02. So if you buy 100 shares for $15,307 and sell this call for $3,602, you will reduce your cost from $153.07 to around $117. And you ""lose"" even more if GME actually goes to the moon because you will have to deliver the shares for $140 (i.e. $14,000) no matter how much they are worth at expiration. So if it is at $1,000, some lucky bastard will pay you only $14k for 100 shares, which he/she can sell for $100k."
2021-04-16 16:28:23,wallstreetbets,"He bought fairly deep ITM calls at the literal top, I'm assuming in Jan during the first squeeze, which effectively cost the same as shares (paid 200 on average to buy at around 300 when the shares costed around 500 at the time). The issue with itm options is that if you let hold as the stock goes deep under the strike (500 to 150) they effectively become worthless, and if it were to ever squeeze he would barely even be all that well leverage since he'd only double his money for every $200 above 500. If he had bought shares he'd only be down like 70%. This is someone who had no idea how options worked. He practically donated his money to MMs."
2021-04-16 13:16:03,wallstreetbets,explanation: people who buy call options for GME are retarded
2021-04-16 12:03:41,wallstreetbets,"$4 to $400 doesn’t happen organically lol it definitely was a squeeze. It’s up for debate whether it was a gamma squeeze, which everyone believes, or if it was a short squeeze. All the shorts claim they got out then and took the hit but I highly doubt they didn’t double down. I agree with you that some shit is still brewing and it’ll squeeze again but believing that a 100x growth in such a short time isn’t a squeeze is just naive."
2021-04-16 16:30:42,wallstreetbets,"Thing is. Buying this deep ITM (I believe he bought these when the stock was around 450-500), you're not even that well leveraged. So if it had gone ballistic, it would've have to have gone into the thousands to start outperforming shares well enough to account for the risk."

2021-04-16 13:11:12,wallstreetbets,"I know what covered calls are. My point is that even if the stock drills, you've still paid for your shares thanks to your calls. So you essentially got free shares."
2021-04-16 18:38:30,wallstreetbets,Did someone say something about sundials and to the mooninites for twenty?
2021-04-16 13:41:51,wallstreetbets,I would not give a flying shit missing on the potential MOASS when you're guaranteed free money.
2021-04-16 13:17:41,wallstreetbets,"No dude the contract is $20,000!!! It's $200 a share"
2021-04-16 15:00:52,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you understand : the share price is at roughly $220 and the premium at $200. So it needs to go down to $20 or lower for you to lose money. And if it goes to the moon, you're not losing money either, you're just missing out on more gains."
2021-04-16 16:09:01,wallstreetbets,"You don't lose! You still have the shares, and can write another contract."
2021-04-16 13:19:54,wallstreetbets,This comment right here sums everything up

2021-04-16 13:18:51,wallstreetbets,"people who believe in the squeeze need to realize 1) they need to buy and hold 2) the most important buyers are the shorters

buying at $250+ isn't as ~~helped~~ helpful as buying at $150"
2021-04-16 19:37:57,wallstreetbets,I believe a mix. They got rid of a lot of their shorts back then. But then they needed to make their money back so they assumed we would all lose interest and quadrupled (or more) down through etf shorting. Yes it was a partial squeeze. Yes it's way more squeezable now than it was then.
2021-04-16 17:47:22,wallstreetbets,Just a recycling bin that I live out of...

2021-04-16 13:13:12,wallstreetbets,"Yes.

There's a couple bags I'm holding at the moment where I'm literally selling monthlies just to offset their purchase cost.

In this case, the premium on GME was insane - it was a free money glitch.

There was tweet, in Chinese, about a rich dude that made $40 million selling 800c in January.  If you've got the margin...."
2021-04-16 15:10:10,wallstreetbets,"There were only 2 days that the April 290c traded above $200: 1/28 and 1/29. Stock was $400, not $220."
2021-04-16 14:23:22,wallstreetbets,"There's a big difference between buying leaps for pennies on a stock that's significantly undervalued vs buying FDs on a stock where the IV is already through the roof, paying nearly as much in premium as the underlying."

2021-04-16 17:26:15,wallstreetbets,"You’re right, but this wasn’t an FD, he must’ve bought it when the SP was in the $300s a few weeks ago. I sell GME CC’s every week, trust me I would’ve sold a $370 FD for even $20 let alone $200 if I could. The price for $370 wasn’t even at $2 earlier this week.

Calls right now are super cheap compared to where they were before. The premiums are nowhere even remotely close to the underlying anymore."

2021-04-16 14:53:20,wallstreetbets,"I really don't get where you're going with this play. Disney was not a $200 stock pre-covid, since then they launched + and have lost billions in the companies other segments. Reopening doesn't effect already lost revenues. + Beat projections dick with a hammer, but there is limited growth left and the revenue per customer is declining which is why the price for just plus is going to increase. With a total assets on hand of about 210 bil and revenues in the 20s or 30s, a fair value of disney with over 1.8 billion shares is way closer to 180 than 280.

Good luck, hope it works out."
2021-04-16 14:07:10,wallstreetbets,My brain legitimately refused to read that is 280 and I kept reading it as 180 and I was confused as fuck as to how you were losing money while being in the money. Why the fuck would you buy $100 out of money expiring in two months with almost 2000 contracts. I hope it goes right because just yellowing lawyer without any fundamentals or research is not really enjoyable. It’s much better if you genuinely researched and then you put your all the money in and still lose.

2021-04-16 15:34:06,wallstreetbets,"Timescale is too tight.  Pandemic is not over and too many states are going full stupid by lifting restrictions before we’ve achieved full vaccination.  Combine that with mire virulent strains it spells disaster.  Disney also put a lot of their park expansions on hold and they are cash strapped so services will be minimal at best.  A lot of us consumers also got hammered financially during COVID so the customer base will be limited.  

I hope it prints but I feel like you painted yourself into a corner on this one"

2021-04-16 16:10:57,wallstreetbets,DIS is a good long-term hold. It's part value and part growth. I sold mines a while back to go all-in on TSLA
2021-04-16 15:42:08,wallstreetbets,"For everyone wondering the thought process:

We aren't being evaluated the same way a Tesla or Netflix does which I think hurts us (this would have been evaluated in the 500's by Cathie Wood standards).... but COVID should have destroyed Disney. There shouldn't be a conversation considering every single thing Disney does requires person to person contact. Theme parks, hotels, cruises, restaurants, and retail are pretty obvious (look at those industries as a whole and you can see the damage Covid did)... even movies, tv shows, and live sports require a lot of humans gathered to make it work... that being said, they only ended up 81 mil in the hole which sounds bad till you realize they had over 17 BIL in cash... that means that the worst, cataclysmic event to happen to such an exposed company could survive for another 200 years. I almost think of this as the opposite of Zoom... so getting wrecked during the pandemic will mean they have the most to gain than anyone else once we reopen. As a student of history, **luxury booms** after wars.... and make no mistake, we went to war with the virus and we have almost won.

Looking ahead there is tons and tons of reasons of reasons to be optimistic. The vaccine roll out has been a huge success and the people most vulnerable are going to pretty much be fully vaccinated by the end of April (Biden will announce the rates on April 28th to confirm some huge milestones right before his 100 days in office is over)... look at the demand that has been piling up. A quick view of the Disneyland website will put you in line for hours (unlike the parks who upgraded their systems and moving people through a lot faster)... take another look around. The banks are killing it because they see people who have been at home for an entire year and want to spend their money (the most they've seen in savings for a long time). So that means that every grandparent who has been waiting to take their grand kids to Disney will pretty much pay anything Disney charges. With no international travel, Orlando and Disneyland will be the number one place to take the kids over the summer before going back to in person school in the fall... CEO said that parks are profitable at 15% capacity so we will be making $$$$$ the moment the doors open

The only real news outside the parks opening up at the end of April is the fact that insiders are buying shares and tons of shares are being scooped up in dark pools. Why? Because they know the monster of a stock they have on their hands. Its literally an interactive Netflix with decades of brand power behind it... Read between the lines folks! They are expanding because they know the future is brighter than it was pre pandemic. No one knew that Disney+ was going to be not only the buoy for them but its subscriber numbers are almost too good to be true (and were only going to get better news at earnings)

The CEO has been on record saying that the vaccine roll outs would be a game changer and I'm inclined to believe him. Not only that, but I think the only part of the business that hasnt moved as nicely as I wanted is about to get some really good news thanks to (dare I say it?) our government. This cruise business will get itself sorted out sooner rather than later, so I'll be the one taking the risk while everyone waits for everything I have said to play out...

I have a lot of shares to go a long with this in case it takes its time but I truly think this will be the hottest stock of the summer and I'm loaded up on these calls

2021-04-16 18:58:24,wallstreetbets,"Disney is trading at all time high. It’s doubled in value from the beginning of the pandemic when stuff was fully closed. Why do you think the stock just spent the last year going nuclear (well nuclear for a boomer stock)? It’s because everyone sees that reopening is coming and can do the exact same math you did.

I love Disney as a stock and how they’ve evolved but what on earth do you see generating $100 more in value before July?"

I totally agree with this one. Literally a lot of friends are talking about reopening and going to Disney or somewhere they can clear their minds as soon as its possible. PS: Im not even from America. Disney sells something that isn't real, its the land of dreams. Which place better to go after the pandemic?

2021-04-16 11:48:34,wallstreetbets,Diversification? That’s when you open a new account with a different broker to buy more GME in case they try to pull another Robin Hood yeah?
2021-04-16 12:23:32,wallstreetbets,"diversification applies to romantic partners, not investing"
2021-04-16 12:28:33,wallstreetbets,"Diversification is accomplished in investing when your money is in different types of vehicles.  Stocks, real estate, company ownerships, CDs, money market, annuities, etc.  When your money is spread “equally” (in terms of risk analysis, not actually equally) throughout these different types of investment vehicles is when you are diversified.  Is usually only truly accomplished by the upper few percent of income earners or trust fund kids.  Owning different price points of the same stock is not diversifying."

2021-04-16 18:02:04,wallstreetbets,"I made like 2k from one shitty option during the first squeeze. I bought an option(for about $100)that was $600 strike price when the stock was at 150 and sold it for 1.6k on the way down from 500(around 400 I sold). It was over 2k at peak. Options spike like crazy during a squeeze like that. It was almost funny, the $800 options went from $2 to $600.

This is why people buy options. I made more off that one option as I would have buying 15 shares at 150. I only had like $300 in my bank account at the time so it was a massive gain for me.

Now I lost $700 today, feels like my luck evened out."

2021-04-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLNY - From slow, boomer REIT to limber Digital Platform about to fly! CLNY used to be Chairman and CEO Tom Barrack's dick extension, something to impress his buddy, Donnie T. while they played Frolf at Mar A Lago. 

Barrack did terrible deals and bought every real estate property under the sun, including Michael Jackson's pedo lair Neverland Ranch. 

The shareholders got fucked as the share price went from $12 in 2017 to under $2 bucks in 2020 and the dividend went away. 

But now, the stock is at $6.7, up 40% in the last 3 months alone. What happened? 

Enter Mark Ganzi. Super stud. 

Ganzi became CEO, Tom's no longer chairman and the company pivoted to a brilliant new strategy. 

No more boomer hotels and healthcare properties. Enter the digital age. 

They started selling all the crappy real estate deals Tom bought and started investing heavily in digital real estate. You know, data centers, towers, all the infrastructure necessary to 5G all those PornHub 1s and 0s straight to your mom's basement. 

This company has so much potential, and Ganzi has done this before. He has the experience and connections in the digital space to make this thing go over $10. Also, he gets a $100 M bonus if the stock stays over 10 for a couple of months. 

As of now, all the big boys are jumping into this and institutional ownership is up to 86%. Plus, we got a couple of shorties to squeeze, about 13% of the float. At a 52W high, they're all feeling the pain and will have to close out soon. 

Do your own DD, but the momentum is there, the business opportunity and the experience of Mark G are there. It's still early to get in, this is a $10+ stock at minimum. 

Positions: 2.4K + shares at 4.4 avg price and some leaps."

I don't know if it happens all the time, and I seriously doubt it's the same if you deliberately go negative due to fraudulent transfers, that's probably lawsuit or charges so don't be a fucking idiot

Hypothetically, let's say you happened to be balls deep in a biotech stock, and RH gave you an irresponsible amount of of margin on said stock. Then, it tanks 70+% in 15 seconds after hours before they can margin call you.  In that case, apparently it's their bad and it goes away after a year, (they donut even bother to ask about it) and wow you sure were stupid paying half the initial amount off because you didn't know this, but lost 60k anyways so it's not like it was all sunshine and rainbows in this hypothetically entirely made up scenario hahaha *sobs*"

HAAAAAPY Friday, $COIN bagholders and canine millionaires (jesus Christ, we really are in simulation)!  **This week was supposed to be about why you should short $PLUG and a thesis about why you should buy 29p's with the equity at 32 (something I hinted about last week in my $NEE DD)**, but it already got annihilated on its own and took out the entire green energy sector with it, and now I think it's almost so beaten down it might be time to go long again, so that's out.  Let's see if we can't get you some of that money back, and enjoy some really bad CGI in the process instead.  This week, let's examine a company which, inexplicably, came out with a robot that can perform surgery 20 years before someone figured out how to automate the cashier at McDonald's (how's that for a checkmark for simulation theory?).  This week's examination is Intuitive Surgical ($ISRG).

&#x200B;

# What do they do?  Well, the TL:DR is they help ensure that you have to wait longer before you can collect the inheritance and life insurance on your Boomer ass parents, because it helps keep them alive.

&#x200B;

They're really more of a product than a company. (yeah, I know about the EndoWrist shit, but that's hardly a revenue generator)  They make the Da  Vinci robot surgeon that you see in hospitals so long as you live in a nicer, more gentrified part of town.  Or work for one of the Colombian drug cartels - those dudes have the best medics.  If you've never heard of it, it's basically a Swiss army knife of attachments that will cut your ass open, fix what it can (sorry, that extra chromosome has to stay), and stitch you back up, all while your surgeon deals with his raging hangover and wonders what happened after he blacked out to where his ass is really sore this morning and the security guard out in the parking lot can't stop smiling at him.  That's it.  That's all they do.  Blah blah blah proprietary software blah blah blah expensive maintenance contracts blah blah blah each attachment for the robot costs money so hopefully your hospital sprang for the clip applier attachment before they snipped that pulmonary vein.  Fingers crossed.

Also, it apparently makes pancakes. :

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Cause that's not creepy at all](https://preview.redd.it/kssh7h1mnht61.jpg?width=993&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c30426e1dd5fba779b9efdc7c524868f364120f2)

&#x200B;

Which goes to show how outdated the tech has become, since everybody knows ebelskivers are superior.

# Deep dive:  This won't hurt a bit, except for the parts where it's excruciatingly bad.

&#x200B;

$ISRG is a 95 billion dollar company that sells about 1200 ~~Treadwell Droids~~  surgical robots a year at 2 million dollars a pop, and has come up with a great scam where some of the attachments are disposable so you have to keep buying them.  God bless America.  They make about a billion a year licensing out their software for use to mitigate the fact that your doctor can't remember which cord goes into which hole, and another 700 million or so on maintenance contracts to reboot the things when they accidentally kill somebody.   They make about 4 billion dollars annually, give or take.  For a company that lives and dies by its R&D, it surprisingly has no debt on the books.  It just makes more shares when they need money.   This also might have something to do with the fact that they haven't really improved on the thing in 20 years because nobody is forcing them to innovate.   They're trading near their ATH, at 804.72 as of the time of this writing.   The biggest fundamental thing to note about this company is that they basically have no competitors.  There is a company out there called (name redacted because of automoddy)  that made a run at the king, but fell so short that they changed their name from (name redacted because of automoddy) Surgical.  It's not that their robot - the Senhance - was bad, per se, it was just that it turned out it was only good for laparoscopics, which is fairly niche.  For the record, I like that company, but we can't talk about them here.

&#x200B;

One thing I've always hated about this company but have held my nose and overlooked was that it's PB ratio is way out of whack for its space.  The average company in the medical equipment industry averages about 5.1 PB.  $ISRG sits at 9.7.  Their PEG also sits at 6.5, which is fucking crazy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Cool.  So how much growth for buying in to the fucking robot army?

&#x200B;

Actually....none.  They made 2.64 a share a year ago, but the whispers on the street - and by street, I mean company executives - are to expect a down quarter this time around due to a combination of less hospital revenue as a result of leaving so much open bed space for the spicy flu and lower demand for elective surgical procedures - and, of course, by lower demand, I mean people being told they can't have them because there's a risk of catching a bug that you'll probably never even know you caught.  $ISRG had been rising recently on the ASSUMPTION that hospitals were going to open back up to more high margin things like elective procedures and away from things like ""leaving half the hospital empty in case 3 people catch the 'Rona"".  However, through the 1st quarter of the year, that has not happened, which means the backlog of surgical procedures just continues to grow.  Ambulatory surgery centers throughout a good chunk of the country still haven't converted away from triage facilities yet or are closing down surgical theatres periodically to reallocate staff, and there's no real word on when that is going to get rectified.

&#x200B;

Analysts have already been adjusting their expectations for the quarter downwards in the last month.  Expectations are now a 4% drop in earnings on flat-to-slightly-up overall revenues.  $ISRG has a habit of beating on earnings pretty much always, but they've reached such a lofty valuation that swapping out Tyson Fury for a Tyson chicken and then bragging you kicked its ass probably isn't going to be that impressive.

&#x200B;

# Wait...so why should I buy it?

Plot twist:  This is a SHORT DD.  My first one since the prophetic $PLTR DD that got -700'd on February 5th before I finally deleted it and let those retards lose their asses **(I'm never going to stop saying I told you so, bitches**).  Bet that was harder to see coming than knowing Will Smith was going to become best friends with a toaster an hour before it happened, eh?

&#x200B;

Actually, that's not entirely true.  This is a hybrid.

# Do technical analyses have feelings?  Feelings are just electrical responses, and technical analyses are based on nothing but electrical responses.

&#x200B;

The thing to note is that it's tested prices in the $81x's 3 times now (let's call it 810, because that's really where liquidity always starts to dry up), and has been rejected all three times.  And it's sitting pretty damn close to that again.  Also, every time it's tested resistance and failed, it's dropped to at least the mid 700's, usually crossing into the 6's briefly, which presently serves as strong support.  It's presently trading near its ATH's not because of anything it's done, but rather because lately the trend has been to rotate into big growth companies again, forgetting that small and mid cap plays exist.  That's all well and good, but one off quarter and you're no longer contributing to the artificial inflation of the $SPY.  This has been a  reliable quiet swing trader for me, but it's now at a crucial pivot point that's going to require a strong catalyst to continue any upwards momentum.  That's bad news for a company reporting earnings in a time when even Wall Street darlings sell off even on great quarters.  At the very least, this is a rally that is quickly running out of gas, as evidenced by reduced volume.  With them reporting next week on the 20th, the pivot point of reckoning is upon us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# My logic is undeniable (or, to summarize):

&#x200B;

* For the 2nd time in a row, an S&P 500 company that operates on the fringes of traditional growth
* Has positively ripped during this rotation from value into growth, in spite of all signals showing a down quarter and poor forward guidance as we are still in a period of Covidic uncertainty and what it means for the operating theatre
* Has no known competitors, which has not pushed them to expand into other revenue channels besides crazy expensive machines meant to cover up for how few decent doctors are entering the workforce anymore
* Is trading at a crucial resistance point that has been rejected forcefully 2 times in the past, with reduced volume each time
* IV on calls is quite pricey, but puts are dirt cheap
* If you really want dad's house, maybe make sure the ambulance sends him to Watts instead of Malibu.  Remember, if he ends up surviving the procedure, he's going to rat you out to the cops

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Price Targets:

&#x200B;

I'm expecting a miss when they report earnings next week, or at the very least a very muted guidance.  As such, I would not be surprised to see this stonk slip all the way down into the 720-740 range before it regains some footing.  Barring some sort of catalyst, I'm having a hard time seeing how this is going to get over that 820 hump any time in the near future.

&#x200B;

# How to play it.  That, detective, is the right question:

&#x200B;

All the technical signs and oscillators are pointing to it becoming a very top heavy trade, which means it's primed for a much bigger negative breakout on the slightest weakness.    All that said, I certainly wouldn't go bear on it long-term.  $ISRG has never been one of the most violent movers, but it has a way of defying the odds, and has displayed that ability in the face of adversity for decades now.  I think if they miss next week and the stock goes into a freefall, be prepared to be nimble and cash out the put and switch back to long, even if it's not necessarily justified.

&#x200B;

# An edit:

If you don't like the short action because of liquidity (a very valid item if you're interested in more than a handful of contracts), skip that part of it and set an alarm to go long at 725-ish.  You'll be happy with that one, too.

&#x200B;

# Position Disclaimers:

&#x200B;

I'm pretty sure I own more than a few shares of this in my managed asset portfolios and, even though my short-term outlook is bearish, am also fairly certain my fund managers aren't going to want to create a taxable event with them.  **I am just flat-out short on the stock itself, but my appetite for potentially unlimited risk is different, and I can't say anybody else should do that.**  I'm holding 4/30 780 puts that I picked up for 10-ish bucks, as well as 5/28 $800p's.  I recently sold off my 7/16 795c's for a tidy profit.   Were I less of a pussy, I'd probably buy some 4/23 780p FD's.  Actually, I might do that for fun, anyways.  But remember, I'm gambling on a selloff on weakness.  If those further out puts print, I will cover them within a week or earnings and look for a consolidation pattern (probably a week or two later) to reverse course and buy some calls for another swing up.

&#x200B;

**Word of caution:**  Buying puts on a mega tech in this environment is an inherently risky move because big money has been rotating into it for weeks now.    This is not a bet-the-house scenario.  I have about a 70% conviction this is gonna go my way, but that other 30% is pretty ugly and basically guarantees a complete loss.  And even if you do play this along with me and it prints, don't sit there and try to milk it for too long.  Some hedge fund could decide it's oversold at 735 and eat away at your tendies.  Fuck that guy.  And then go buy one of these, because fucking him is legally perilous and he might fight back - the robot will never say no.

2021-04-16 13:17:19,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for sharing. As a robot surgeon myself, maybe I can give back some love by giving my opinion on the matter.

First of all, it is surprising how much of this info is quite accurate so you 've certainly done a good job about that, which gives you more credibility IMO. Maybe not the hangover part but still.

Speaking long term, this company is here to stay. The technology they offer is second to none.  The ease of operating, what we can achieve, it really is world changing. Robotic surgery is already well established and will continue to grow as more and more procedures are bound to be performed robot-assisted and not laparoscopically anymore.

They have an excellent business model in which instruments are disposable, big maintenance contracts, and a new model every few years (so they did improve, actually, and continue to do so); support for older models is no longer offered at some point so you have to buy the new one.

They have no competition because they simply buy up any company that is doing anything remotely similar. Some other companies I saw are trying to improve laparoscopy rather than completely reinvent  it, mostly because robotics are quite expensive. They try to take the niche for procedures that are too simple to waste robotic resources on, but still require a lot of laparoscopic skills. However, sorry to offend, but a lot of these alterations look clunky and seem unreliable and unpractical.

The only reason why not everyone is using the robot already, is exactly this, that Intuitive really takes good advantage of its monopoly position, and so it really is expensive to use it.

I believe that at some point in the future, another company eventually will offer a robotic system that is up to the same quality standards. IMO this can only be a company that is big enough to support their own R&D and not be swallowed by Intuitive. For me, Medtronic is the best bet for this (or maybe some Chinese company). This then would lead to a significant drop in costs for robotic surgery (and probably a big drop in stock price for Intuitive); on the other hand, it would make robotic surgery even more mainstream and as Intuitive is already quite on top, they are likely to be able to withstand the competition and remain a top player in the field, and continue to grow from this in the long term.

It is true that corona caused a backlog even in this kind of surgery (it has a lot of oncological applications, but even some of those got postponed), also put a hold on congresses, training programs etc. and a tepmorary drop in revenue is certainly possible.

&#x200B;

TLDR: I share your opinion that the stock will come down from where it is now, but probably only momentarily. I will be hoping with you for a drop in Intuitive stock price, but will use it as an entry point for a long position instead (which in retrospect, I should have done already a long time ago). In the meantime, I am long Medtronic as well. Not very wallstreetbetsy, but I believe these are both good plays long term."

2021-04-16 12:41:33,wallstreetbets,"Cool thread and mostly enjoyed what you had to say and took some notes. I have to pull you up on one point though, laparascopics are niche?

Laparascopic surgery is preferred to open surgery wherever possible. Less scarring, less chance of infection, less chance of cutting through stuff you didn’t mean to cut through. Interventional radiology and laparascopic surgery is very much the direction of travel for invasive procedures, and has been for some time. Of course you’re not going to be able to fix a mid shaft compound femur fracture laprascopically, but I wouldn’t be surprised if someone has tried and then written a paper about it.

Not a surgeon myself but work in a trauma centre beside a team of surgeons and anaesthetists."

It absolutely hit and only got dragged down with the broader green energy sector.  BE shot up about 12 but got dragged down with green as well.  I still like both theses - though $BE I pushed my 31's to August.  $CLNE I still love the original play of June 13's.  It's been getting artificially suppressed by one whale this week, but you see it has wanted to break out.

&#x200B;

Semi DD bought everybody lambos.  Cruise ships got everybody 17' Bayliners.  PLTR...well, nobody listened, but PLTR was a 15 bagger.  $NVDA in the comments is a 5 bagger and growing.  $NEE is already in the money a week later.  $NVTA is flat but you can see the movement coiling.  Weed was good for a pop.  I don't even know how much I've made calling $RIOT shots.

2021-04-16 14:43:31,wallstreetbets,"Damn, that could have all went into Cry. p. to and who knows what could have happened to it. I lost 40k on GME calls too, this makes me feel better. Day-trade more to control everything and nothing to change is the best advice I can give rn if you're going to continue options trading, especially on RH.

Even yesterday, I left a call to chance(RIOT) after getting +$75-112 on a $85 call I day-traded, buying a $50 strike price call that expired today. Overnight, it dropped, the same call was cheaper.

I've lost a lot of money like you. I'm now going to be patient, have a few long calls(On WeBull), and only do options mainly when day-trades are available for me on RH.

I've done enough learning about ETF's, taking other's advice, spy/qqq, tqqq, spxl, soxx, soxl, hyping dates, corruption, opportunity cost, everything besides some long call experience.(I haven't been in the game too much and seem to be good at that.) Back to what I'm best at until I feel decent enough to go learning / exploring stuff again. And with my new risk-management skills, I'll never be worse off from here if I do it right. I also, peronally, think you should aim to make calls that are more assured than buying/day-trading SPY/QQQ, or any weighted variation of them during a dip - and then re-selling soon after. That's a good trade to me. And maybe I'll try some SPY/QQQ or their weighted variations options with my $100 worth of day-trading. If you buy during a dip, these ETF'S can be decently predictable. Don't make bad trades just because they're all you can afford. Just so much learned...

Literally gonna start day-trading with $100 on RH again starting Apr. 26th at the latest, and profit-taking once I get +$100, if I blow an entire $100 up with a day-trade... (Which would let me sell it, if it's looking grim.) Then, it blows up, and I watch stocks/cry.p. to. and try again with another $100 my next check - or my back-up $100's. (Gonna always be profit taking $100's and only using $100 I THINK, until further notice for RH day-trading.) Leave nothing to chance. The market trends change everyday. Just trying to give sincere advice!\~"

2021-04-16 11:28:52,wallstreetbets,"RIP. If it where to happen, it would be closer to 4.20 and even then, HF's DO NOT HAVE TO BUY EVER. They can do a failure to deliver https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_to_deliver which means instead of buying a REAL GME share at $150 causing it to moon, they will instead screw us by paying a tiny FTD fine in the pennies. They can pay the FTD forever. Until the stocks come down to 40, there is zero incentive to ever not pay the FTD. Buying stock and causing the squeeze is the absolute last thing. Now what happens is that a HF decides on FRIDAY to buy a shitload of stock. This price drives up the stock really fast on FRIDAY. Then the value of people's calls also go up, which _could_ have an impact if they execute and then hodl. Point is, it has to be a perfect storm of options in the money, a big money whale buying on Friday, massive volume, and a stock recall for it to squeeze. We will see today at 3:55, 5:55, and on 420."

2021-04-16 14:31:48,wallstreetbets,It happened. Twice.
2021-04-16 14:35:08,wallstreetbets,Holy ass burger
2021-04-16 14:38:28,wallstreetbets,"bruh...... BRUH

2021-04-16 14:39:37,wallstreetbets,Oh no. Baby what is u doin?
2021-04-16 15:31:13,wallstreetbets,"What makes me sad is people saw this dudes original post and viewed that as more ""confirmation"" that there will be a squeeze, causing more and more people to follow. Such a shitty cycle they've all started for eachother but damn is it entertaining"
2021-04-16 15:37:31,wallstreetbets,"Wait, it's at 155 now. Does that mean that OP made money?

Edit: Wait, I think I read it wrong. His break even price is >400, not the 154 at the bottom.

F's in chat for OP"
2021-04-16 10:33:55,wallstreetbets,I just bought shares today. Let’s F’ing GO!!! TO THE MOON
2021-04-16 11:10:14,wallstreetbets,"NO....amc and gme squeeze are dead!  never happening, liftoff has been postponed.  not sure why we keep talking about it."
2021-04-16 11:35:56,wallstreetbets,Any retard with enough patience (and grape flavored crayons) can make a fake chart and post it here and have thousands of people think it’s real.
2021-04-16 11:22:52,wallstreetbets,It's still on but you should've done shares
2021-04-16 13:00:21,wallstreetbets,"But to answer: Yes, it is still on.

Anyone who gets depressed by the current price is a paper-handed fool or just a newbie who didn't read the DD.

I don't care if it goes to 80 or to 240 today. That's TOTALLY irrelevant to the incoming squeeze."
2021-04-16 10:44:45,wallstreetbets,Nah this shit is dead money. Don’t believe the hype anymore.
2021-04-16 10:50:46,wallstreetbets,Learning moment for me. Can someone explain this pic with easy to understand details?
2021-04-16 12:04:38,wallstreetbets,the DD said shares not calls
2021-04-16 15:33:00,wallstreetbets,ouchie.  Yes the squeeze is still on. Sadly not today.  its taking a long time to develop.

2021-04-16 13:33:08,wallstreetbets,You bet your retarded ass it still is!

2021-04-16 14:22:05,wallstreetbets,"I guess what I don't understand (and someone feel free to educate an ape) is that from what I can tell, the way to trigger the MOASS is for people to a) buy the stock, and b) hold the stock, so that when the hedgie shorts are due, they have to buy the shares back at essentially an absolutely bonkers clown-shoes price.

Now if the opportunity to sell shares back at a bonkers clown-shoes price exists, why are people futzing around with options? Isn't that counter-productive to triggering the MOASS?"

2021-04-16 14:51:22,wallstreetbets," 

Damn, that could have all went into Cry. p. to and who knows what could have happened to it. I lost 40k on GME calls too, this makes me feel better. Day-trade more to control everything and nothing to change is the best advice I can give rn if you're going to continue options trading, especially on RH.

Even yesterday, I left a call to chance(RIOT) after getting +$75-112 on a $85 call I day-traded, buying a $50 strike price call that expired today. Overnight, it dropped, the same call was cheaper.

I've lost a lot of money like you. I'm now going to be patient, have a few long calls(On WeBull), and only do options mainly when day-trades are available for me on RH."

Sell when it’s up and let’s move to others shorts are trying to take down. IMO Best Buy’s for a squeeze rn are amc and XL fleet a lot of talk on Reddit and finwit shorts borrowing too many shares could end bad for them. After the squeeze sell and let’s move on to the next one u can’t be greedy in the market or it will humble u. I’m not trying to tell u how to spend your money this is just my opinion been doing this for some years. The game is rigged we got to win battles to win this war. But it’s your money your choice I can’t tell the future who knows game stop might squeeze to a 1,000 I hope so I rather us make the rules than hedge fund fucks."

2021-04-16 16:34:14,wallstreetbets,"Lol yeah but not for options, gotta read up on the max pain theory my dude. Options are lame, buy and hold is where it’s at. NFA.

Max pain: the closing price where the MOST Puts and Calls are OTM. SHF use calls/puts to conceal FTDs and if they move favorably also would provide more capital to the SHF to continue the fuckery. There have been some almost too perfect closing Fridays in the last few months, each week ending very close to the max pain number for options expiring that week."
2021-04-16 16:39:07,wallstreetbets,God damn... I feel a Lil less fucked over by the March 19th guru bullshit... I was right there with you bud... diamond handed 250k into the dirt... however I just sold my house squeeze still on... get back in bud! It’s not over

2021-04-16 14:30:15,wallstreetbets,Maybe try following what is going on with this highly manipulated stock? That buy orders though citadel's markets are routed to the bulk market and sells are not?

If you were expecting a quick buck, I am sorry but it is going to be one hell of a ride as the HF are going to pull out ever dirty trick since the SEC is just twiddling their thumbs till the new boss gets moving, What I have seen watching GME and others is they will do what I think is called Spoofing,  pretend to sell/buy to bring price down, hoping people will sell...  At this point Fuck em, and HOLD"

2021-04-16 11:21:00,wallstreetbets,Bro have you not read any of the max pain theory DD? Options are not the way when it’s literally free to hold shares. But seeing that you threw $100k at a whim I’m sure you will be fine
2021-04-16 11:35:17,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but we need to buy more to be sure"
2021-04-16 12:02:37,wallstreetbets,Before I jerk off on this... I hope OP is okay first... keep your head up if you have shares because I will hold and squeeze em dry like what I would do to my johnson after you confirm you’re okay.
2021-04-16 12:03:28,wallstreetbets,Idk why people play options at this point on the stock since January all anyone has needed to do is buy shares and hold.

2021-04-16 14:51:28,wallstreetbets,"I've done enough learning about ETF's, taking other's advice, spy/qqq, tqqq, spxl, soxx, soxl, hyping dates, corruption, opportunity cost, everything besides some long call experience.(I haven't been in the game too much and seem to be good at that.) Back to what I'm best at until I feel decent enough to go learning / exploring stuff again. And with my new risk-management skills, I'll never be worse off from here if I do it right. I also, peronally, think you should aim to make calls that are more assured than buying/day-trading SPY/QQQ, or any weighted variation of them during a dip - and then re-selling soon after. That's a good trade to me. And maybe I'll try some SPY/QQQ or their weighted variations options with my $100 worth of day-trading. If you buy during a dip, these ETF'S can be decently predictable. Don't make bad trades just because they're all you can afford. Just so much learned...

Literally gonna start day-trading with $100 on RH again starting Apr. 26th at the latest, and profit-taking once I get +$100, if I blow an entire $100 up with a day-trade... (Which would let me sell it, if it's looking grim.) Then, it blows up, and I watch stocks/cry.p. to. and try again with another $100 my next check - or my back-up $100's. (Gonna always be profit taking $100's and only using $100 I THINK, until further notice for RH day-trading.) Leave nothing to chance. The market trends change everyday.

2021-04-16 16:38:48,wallstreetbets,"> max pain theory

Oh you probably still are. There are many levels!"
2021-04-16 17:18:45,wallstreetbets,"FWIW, DFV started out in 2019 with only options on GME.

And hypothetically, if you think you can time when a squeeze will happen, your profits on options will be exponentially larger than shares alone. 

$5k to spend, if you buy shares today and it moons to $10k/share by April 30, you net just under $320k. Same play with far OTM options nets you around $40M.

Then again, if it's one trading day later, shares nets you the same $320k and options nets you -$5k."
2021-04-16 11:44:10,wallstreetbets,I don’t think you know where you are. This is a casino.
2021-04-16 10:42:28,wallstreetbets,So is GME what's your point?

2021-04-16 15:37:54,wallstreetbets,Yes they have 😎
2021-04-16 15:41:03,wallstreetbets,Would be curious to know if the covered call income has surpassed the loss in share price for people selling calls. I didn't think selling calls would end up being profitable because of the share price falling. I guess the idea would be to just hold forever and keep selling the call options.
2021-04-16 14:52:40,wallstreetbets,Lol

There isn't some magic that picks up at the 2-month mark that makes theta a thing. Theta is high OTM, low ITM. LEAPS and timeframe do *not* change that.

The only way you could be right about this is highly circumstantial and involves you buying a lot of deep-ITM LEAPS that mysteriously become ATM/OTM as they age"

2021-04-16 19:18:38,wallstreetbets,"Early on before things went crazy, yea options were understandable. But now the price is so well controlled, if the shorts don't want your options to expire ITM...they wont."
2021-04-16 15:59:30,wallstreetbets,"His alone? no. But him combined with the other hundreds of millions of dollars in options moved. Very likely.

Which not to shame people betting on options. But the irony of betting on the squeeze while no contributing to it. Dunno seems like a retarded move."
2021-04-16 17:20:52,wallstreetbets,I'm sorry for a big loss. It must hurt. Hang in there. Tough days will pass. Dont do this again.
2021-04-16 11:05:51,wallstreetbets,It’ll be okay friend

2021-04-16 11:00:40,wallstreetbets,"I'm not but those were retarded
Buying 50k shares and selling covered calls while having small Yolo positions and buying dips woulda been better"
2021-04-16 11:25:41,wallstreetbets,True
2021-04-16 11:34:01,wallstreetbets,Well then open the gotdamn thing!
2021-04-16 19:38:09,wallstreetbets,Not when an OTM weekly costs +20%. Buying OTM is for retards

2021-04-16 12:57:22,wallstreetbets,I agree with the message but it's not like buying GME is a safe bet right now either.

Is GME normal? Noh."
2021-04-16 15:06:41,wallstreetbets,any plans to do things different in the future or already fiending for another big dopamine rush?
2021-04-16 14:08:59,wallstreetbets,They cock blocked it in January but it did happen. Squeeze 2.0 happened last month as well. Will there be a third? I think probably but don't think we break 300 again.

2021-04-16 16:23:03,wallstreetbets,Heard it on newsweek but who knows
2021-04-16 13:32:22,wallstreetbets,why would they ever not? if you’re okay with getting your shares called away at a certain price then it’s practically an ATM. also folks have the option of rolling contract if need be.
2021-04-16 13:10:11,wallstreetbets,"With a cost avg of $50, I'd happily take $400 for my shares."
2021-04-16 16:50:40,wallstreetbets,"When are covered calls not lucrative? The worst that can happen is missing out on bigger gains. 

Then again, my biggest regrets are from missing out on bigly gains over bigly losses."
2021-04-16 13:57:56,wallstreetbets,A $250 Strike weekly makes about $400-500/week.
2021-04-16 15:38:38,wallstreetbets,"Exactly right.  I have been selling covered calls on GME, which has been great for a while, but the stock is dropping so much (and obviously still extremely overpriced, so a huge drop could come any time) that it is not profitable any more; I'm stopping after this week."
2021-04-16 14:55:52,wallstreetbets,"He'd be smart to sell calls, can't say if he is or not. He's also made like $40M so probably doesn't need to."
2021-04-16 15:54:58,wallstreetbets,If he is hustling then he'd better use the money to buy a decent private security force
2021-04-16 17:45:17,wallstreetbets,You’re more retarded than a retarded ape if you actually believe DFV is hustling apes with calls lmao gtfo here
2021-04-16 15:48:04,wallstreetbets,Almost certainly I think DFV is selling covered calls deep OTM or has a second account where he is buying puts to hedge. When your up as much as he is there is literally no reason not to do that and it would be kind of silly not too if you want to keep holding.
2021-04-16 15:21:27,wallstreetbets,DFV owning $50 calls is completely irrelevant to a discussion about covered calls.
2021-04-16 18:19:08,wallstreetbets,"Calls have a T+2 for the market, wont see movement until 420. He did tweet that he exercised his calls though"
2021-04-16 19:25:15,wallstreetbets,"No, because if he was selling covered calls he would be limiting his upside and he never would have made millions of dollars in the first place."
2021-04-16 18:09:11,wallstreetbets,Nope. They're still cooking in the pot. Pretty much only thing green in my portfolio lol
2021-04-16 12:06:09,wallstreetbets,100% true. He can totally ask for a refund.

We can only speculate on the reasons behind it tho, could be friendly whales trying to lower ImpVol to set up a Gamma Squeeze, could also be them trying to keep it as close as possible to Max Pain Price which was $150 for this Friday, or even the DTCC keeping things under control to let GME explode after they’ve implemented their new rules. All I know is holding and patience anyways"
2021-04-16 16:27:56,wallstreetbets,Betting on a GME squeeze in general after 2 massive pops is probably the silly move.
2021-04-16 16:33:53,wallstreetbets,"I mean that's pretty much all options. In the end individual investors don't move the price at all so why delude ourselves into thinking there's a movement?

2021-04-16 11:14:32,wallstreetbets,"I'm new at this too, so someone correct me if I'm wrong.  He paid $117.95 per stock, for just the right to actually buy that stock on or before today for $320 each.  He bought 10 contracts, and each contract is for 100 stocks.  

The price hasn't reached nearly that, so after today the contracts expire and he will have lost his entire investment.  

He can sell his contracts to another sucker for 4 cents per stock."
2021-04-16 11:21:34,wallstreetbets,"He bet $120,000 that it would go to $450 or higher by 4/16.

2021-04-16 17:54:38,wallstreetbets,"He just posted an update ya tard

He exercised his 4/16 12c and bought an additional 50,000 shares on top of that."
2021-04-16 14:51:53,wallstreetbets,"Because you're still exposed to downside risk. You need 100 shares to sell 1 call, so if you bought 100 now at 150 and sell a 200c a month out for $1800, then the stock drops to $75, then you get to keep your $1800 but you're down $7500 on the shares"
2021-04-16 13:36:47,wallstreetbets,"Because the calls are only worth a lot because the stock is highly volatile. At some point GME will find its actual value, stop having wild daily fluctuations, and suddenly will no longer be a lucrative lottery ticket factory."
2021-04-16 16:25:02,wallstreetbets,"one day there will be a short squeeze, and then some regret

2021-04-16 16:08:33,wallstreetbets,">why would they ever not?

When TD won't let you sell them even if you've owned the shares for years, unless you wait on the phone for 72 hours to speak to a broker."
2021-04-16 16:21:06,wallstreetbets,"They could not be if the stock crashed, but as long as it stays the same or goes up you're gold."
2021-04-16 17:35:05,wallstreetbets,"When the stonk goes up or down a lot.

If it goes up massively your gains are capped.

If it goes down massively you could have made more selling."
2021-04-16 17:36:37,wallstreetbets,"Adding on, you are forced to hold GME until those contracts are exercised (or you buy them out). If you bought GME at $40, and were selling CCs, you wouldn't care if the stock dropped from $140 to $100 or if you got exercised selling ATM CCs; you would still be up. If you bought in at $300, and were selling CCs, you'd be pissed to have them carried away at anything else less than that. It would take you forever to break even trying to lower your DCA down to current stock value, and there is no way IV will remain that high for you to do so. The best way to DCA in that situation isn't going to make you that much money, and if the stock did decide to jump up $150 you would have missed your opportunity to break even. If I was down 50%+ I'd probably hold and wait for another spike, then jump off the ship. The person selling CCs to DCA would be forced to sell and realize the loss, while you are still in control of your shares.

Selling CCs also means that you are forced to go down with the ship if it decides to tank. Yeah, you can buy back your CCs and sell your shares but that will take a lot of time and you might miss your mark.

GME is a better scalping opportunity than a theta play. Selling CCs and CSPs isn't a free money ticket. You can lose serious dough really quick if you aren't smart about it. I hate using these phrases but it really is like ""picking up pennies in front of a steamroller."" 

I made a stupid amount of money in the first squeeze and got out after Cuban did his AMA (his statements contradicted a lot of the DDs posted here). Like the daddy issues within me, I couldn't resist GME though and started chasing those premiums. I was making a stupid amount of money for a minute but I ended up losing like 20% of my gains because I was forced to go down with the ship one weekend. TSLA fucked me too but I bought out before it collapsed below $600. I'm still up bigly YoY but I'm sticking to far OTM on GME and playing it safe for now on."
2021-04-16 14:18:56,wallstreetbets,"If they get assigned, you hand over the 100 shares per contract and get $400 per share, yes?

And if not assigned you get the (on a monthly, currently) $400 premium per contract? Seems like free money. Except for the fact that you basically need 10k in shares as collateral for only $400 premium"
2021-04-16 14:05:08,wallstreetbets,"In the past month the stock is down $70, or over $15 a week. So even $5 for the call means you lose $1000 a contract per week (granted individual weeks are better or worse).

A nice hedge if you want to hold the stock, but probably not a good CC play."

what upside is lost by offering contracts no one has any reason to exercise?  
even if someone wanted to pay $300 for 100 shares worth $150 he could just buy another 200 lmao."
2021-04-16 18:10:32,wallstreetbets,Remember the opportunity cost. Unless you would initiate the trade again right now for the current terms I would buy it back and look for something else. Probably not making you much per day on Theta.
2021-04-16 12:17:14,wallstreetbets,Otherwise ask to speak to their manager. That normally works

Even the idea that the landed gentry who inherit their wealth just do nothing isn’t true. Clout is important and in those circles people pursue high profile high IQ careers. Yeah you see the few examples of retarded rich kids, but that’s not taking into consideration that the rest of the family are doctors, lawyers, and scientists.

2021-04-16 17:09:06,wallstreetbets,"Point taken. Though I hold one GME and never plan on selling.

But options are meant for hedging, insurance, or an alternative way of buying shares in the future (IE you want to own in the future, but not fully commit to it now).

They're not really meant for gambling like how many people here use them."

2021-04-16 18:07:53,wallstreetbets,Omg what a madman lol
2021-04-16 18:27:58,wallstreetbets,"Ya but if it's a long term hold for you anyway and you wouldnt have sold, what's the difference.

This extreme example makes it risky for sure.   But if you apply cover call to stable stocks with lower volatility,  you'll make less on the premium but it still offers extra income safely."
2021-04-16 16:46:18,wallstreetbets,Which is why you might as well sell a naked put lol. Synthetically speaking they are equivalent but people are just more afraid of a naked put because the downside risk is 100 x Share Price even though.... that’s literally the risk of holding 100 shares.
2021-04-16 18:03:05,wallstreetbets,"I use cover calls on stocks I plan on owning for a while, even then I often do Diagonal Calendar calls (PMCC) as the capital is lower. Same risk of the underlying tanking though."
2021-04-16 13:46:43,wallstreetbets,"very true, very true. ideally folks could have sold enough CCs in that time to make it worth their while but of course that’s never a guarantee."
2021-04-16 15:18:51,wallstreetbets,"Then you profit because you sold calls that are worth a lot, and now they're super cheap? 

The only way you lose is if the stock goes down. Even then you lose less than somebody who just had shares. Selling covered calls offers you *less* exposure to price in both directions than just holding shares."
2021-04-16 14:06:56,wallstreetbets,couldnt the same process be carried out with any overly shorted stock?
2021-04-16 15:16:09,wallstreetbets,"To be honest, covered calls are more lucrative in general. Avoid dividend stocks unless you micro manage and make sure you can still get the divi and you'll make guaranteed returns that beats S&P yearly. This is part of the reason why hedge funds show massive returns yearly even during a bear market. It literally is free money, even if its a blue chip stock and you do 1% a month returns. Only issue is if the stocks sky rocket."
2021-04-16 14:45:14,wallstreetbets,Yeah prob starting next week too after being so static for 3 weeks almost.
2021-04-16 14:48:04,wallstreetbets,I think the fluctuations aren't going away any time soon.
2021-04-16 15:14:46,wallstreetbets,and that will be great for the cc seller? what's your point?
2021-04-16 14:04:10,wallstreetbets,"This is WSB, what do you expect? Bring on the retards!"
2021-04-16 15:07:41,wallstreetbets,simply buy it back and sell another one. Robinhood doesn’t have a feature to roll it all in one transaction like some other brokerages do but it’s still possible.
2021-04-16 14:46:28,wallstreetbets,"You need 100 shares per contract (Option).

If the premium for a weekly is say $400 ($4/share), I sell that weekly (Call), receive $400, and if the Strike Price is hit by expiry, my shares get sold for that amount. If it doesn't hit the Strike, I keep the Premium and do it all again.

Because my cost avg is so low (around $50), even if I sell deep OTM Calls, say for $300 Strike, I'm saying if it squeezes and goes past that, the max I could get for my shares is $300.

So I sell covered calls because I'm either fine selling them my shares for the chosen Strike, or don't think it will hit and I just collect Premium."
2021-04-16 14:33:37,wallstreetbets,"If I’m reading your statement right, then you’re getting options pricing a little wrong. In this case, assuming the same person wrote all those calls, then they made $117 per share (italics) in the contract- so 10 X 100 X 117, or about 117000 dollars for 1000 shares. And they get to keep the shares. Rich fucks"
2021-04-16 15:20:12,wallstreetbets,"You could be selling covered calls that are 300 days out, and you'd be making a boatload of money right now. 

You could also be selling calls that are ITM, and you'd be making a ton of money right now.

There's no way of knowing if a covered call strategy was making money without knowing more about the play itself. Every CC can potentially be good. Like all options strategies, it depends on your ability to forecast implied volatility and direction."
2021-04-16 15:35:42,wallstreetbets,"Not as rare as you'd think.  A lot of people just want enough to be comfortable, anything else and they'd prefer it be used to help others be comfortable too.  Not everyone is so selfish as to pile on meaningless wealth rather than help others.  There are lots of people that are, but it's not rare to find those that aren't."

2021-04-16 13:55:18,wallstreetbets,I missed out on over a million dollars in gains selling covered calls ; it’s doesn’t always work out. And unless you have the capital to move out of them your just stuck. Every time you start seeing a lot of calls being sold the price is bound to correct so shorts can cover.
2021-04-16 14:48:31,wallstreetbets,Doesn't have to be heavily shorted stocks. Besides it's not like retailers know shit about where they'll actually go.

2021-04-16 14:31:43,wallstreetbets,"Roughly I think of these scenarios. Doesn't have to be GME, just makes it funnier. 

* Stocks 101: Man, I bought GME and hope it keeps going up. 
* Stocks 201: Man, I bought GME and sold some {other stock} short, hope GME goes up and {other stock} goes down. 
* Stocks 301: Man, I bought some GME puts and some GME calls, I hope it moves a lot, either way I make money!
* Stocks 799: Ok, I sold covered boatload of GME covered calls and a boatload of GME covered puts. As long as it doesn't end between 150-155 or 180-185 on the second Thursday in May I'm going to be swimming in cash!"
2021-04-16 17:59:49,wallstreetbets,"Funny you say that. I also missed out on at least $1.4M not once but twice on GME. Sitting on about 7k shares that were in cc. Sucks to realize there is nothing you can do. Also once it gets too deep itm it is almost impossible to roll them.

I did have a bunch of calls I bought that I was able to sell so don't feel too bad. Joined the 2 comma club that way."

2021-04-16 19:21:19,wallstreetbets,"You can roll with a “two option” buy/sell that allows you to use the premium from your sell to simultaneously buy back your original option. 

So you’re never stuck because the later dated premium on the roll will always be greater than the premium you will have to pay for the same strike."
2021-04-16 18:53:47,wallstreetbets,Monitor? More like 30 min a week.
2021-04-16 19:10:53,wallstreetbets,"well, if that system works consistently you should theoretically be able to increase your yield via either additional leverage (margin) or additional capital, no? which would mean you could just take all the profit and put it back in and generate scaling wealth over time.

though I'm of the understanding that there aren't any strategies that always profit regardless of what the future holds, so there's not really any such thing as a 'consistent' strategy so much as there are 'high expected yield at low risk' strategies."

It’s like a rubber band in life, it snapped back and hit my ass hard now. 

Thankfully my partner, although jobless, is perfect at budgets, maximizing income, somehow she found money in my income to help pay down bills and give me money to play with stocks.

I’m not debt free yet, but within another 8-10 month I should be, which makes GME or whatever stocks take off be more amazing since I can shove it into savings for those rainy days or if I ever get tired of my job.

I always said my life wish was just to not be afraid to leave a job if they didn’t want to give a raise or listen to my wants and needs. It just seems so foreign to me to be able to go to your boss and say “damn it, it’s been 3 years I need a raise, here’s all the things I’ve done, added responsibility and here’s the market salary for my title and position. I’m not asking full match just goddamn get me there”

Right now I’m 20-40k /year under paid for my skill set and position, but at the moment other benefits make up for it. However my as it’s gonna want a raise. Ain’t seen a cost of living increase in 3 years, no bonus this year since 2020 was shit, they say no raises issued either this year. I’m like so y’all gonna drop us to a 4 day work week then? 

As these days go by and my partner shows me how little we are actually spending to maintain what I call a good life, I see I don’t have to put up with so much shit later on.

Yeah, of course I want that $110,000 micro LED tv from Samsung, a sweet Tesla, the best gaming rig and biggest house. However, none of that is in my reality. I’m not skilled, disciplined or talented enough to grow much farther than in an in my current career. Apart from contract work, I’m not too far from making maximum. Sure 20-40k off from my position in my part of the country, maybe I could make double what I do now. That’s a lot of hours and a helluva lot of work, and I got few realistic material goals in life.

At 37, 2020 was potentially the closest to retirement I’ll ever come. Remote work that aloud me to enjoy home life hobbies like 3D printing and learning stocks, playing video games. I realized, that’s about all I want right now. 

Gone are the days of wanting to waste money on clothes, I never have owned jewelry, hell apart from my Apple Watch that’s about all that is worn on me outside clothes. 

Sure, there’s some luxurious ass expensive stuff and I’ll splurge for that. I mean, I still wear and have a shirt from when in was 14. Not only has it not faded, thanks to my 2000’s baggy clothes self it basically fits 30’s me perfectly and it’s just a collared button up shirt. Some vintage Hurley these days.

I told my partner the other day, returning to work (office) has shown me , that’s not what I want to do at all for any more years than in have to."

2021-04-16 15:17:08,wallstreetbets,how does your strategy get dumber from 301 to 799? You might want to retake some of those classes in the middle homie.
2021-04-16 18:14:51,wallstreetbets,After my cc’s expired I re bought in and made a few hundred thousand on the 3/4 squeeze. I ended up paying off my house then putting the rest back into GME. I will probably hold my remaining shares for a while. But I agree it’s very weird pretty much confirms my bias that market makers are using order flow to buy a bunch of puts or calls then sell or buy a bunch of shares to print their options orders.
2021-04-16 16:32:15,wallstreetbets,I bought 5800 shares of gme at $45.6 sold 58 covered calls at $46 expiring on 2/26. I didn’t have enough karma at the time to post it here. Still got the screen shots tho lol. Rough week indeed talk about needing some $ROPE. Made 14k in premiums tho lol.
2021-04-16 19:38:52,wallstreetbets,I didn’t have a million dollars to roll my options so yes I was stuck.
2021-04-16 16:55:30,wallstreetbets,"No, Max profit is no shares being called away as you keep the premium plus the underlying shares, and you can rinse and repeat this process. It’s a chicken laying eggs vs. cooking the chicken. Both give you something good to eat. One allows you to keep on eating, the other allows you to eat one time. If the chicken lays only 2 or 3 eggs before it dies, you would have gotten more food eating the chicken straight up. If the chicken lays 1000 eggs before it dies, you better enjoy frittatas motherfucka. Also you get more food from the eggs than the chicken"
2021-04-16 13:05:21,wallstreetbets,I’m taking that to heart.
2021-04-16 13:18:11,wallstreetbets,"Sell first though, *then* take the screenshot. I've had substantial drops happen between the time I took the screenshot and got the sale completed."
2021-04-16 14:27:00,wallstreetbets,I think I might get this tattooed on my chest
2021-04-16 16:30:33,wallstreetbets,"Yeah man, it's rough.  I mean, I personally believe that the stock will hit around 350$ again.  At a conservative value, 285$.  I'm hanging out around 169$ at 32 shares.

So today, I'm down a bit.  Yesterday, I was even.  I've overall lost about 750$ so far in terms of where the stock is sitting currently.  Two weeks ago, I was up twice that much.

Whatever happens, I will be happy selling 280-350.  I feel really bad for these people who really think that the short squeeze will happen all at once, and not slowly reaching something maybe 1000$ at tops if a miracle happens.  I think people aren't seperating the meme from the reality, and are forgetting that we are dealing with market makers and hedge funds who are doing whatever they can to break the rules."
2021-04-16 16:48:03,wallstreetbets,"You slovak? Or just like the language? :)

And I agree with your point.  
I had a back injury years ago, and the doctor (while doing doctor stuff) asked what I did.  
I replied I was studying mechanical engineering.

How responded ""OMG - you must be so smart!""

I (a bit shocked that my doctor thought he was dumber than an engineer) asked why..

He said all he does is memorise flowcharts of symptoms, basically. If you feel this, then you have that.

He was in awe of someone who could calculate, design, etc.."
2021-04-16 14:58:04,wallstreetbets,"GME as a company it's miles in better position compared to the AMC. Squeeze or not, fundamentals are much better than 6 months ago."

2021-04-16 15:34:49,wallstreetbets,"I mean you can make it crazy complex and there are more pieces, there are also long-term strategies that are viable for, well investing, not well... just gambling like we frequently discuss here.   


If you can predict where something will end up (or where it'll stay) you can make money. There's just always the chance that it doesn't and then there are ways to mitigate that maximum loss or damage.   


Still I'm far from an expert and just a small fish."
2021-04-16 17:04:19,wallstreetbets,"Not even close to 2%. With a high IV stock like GME, ATM monthly premiums alone have a 20%+ break even. If everything is covered, you own the stock and wrote calls against that position while the puts are covered with cash so you can buy the stock at the strike price minus premium.

In worst case scenarios, it goes up too much, move up the strikes of the short puts so you can get the stock back when it’s called away. If the stock goes down too much, you move down the strikes of the short calls so someone will buy from you when you get assigned.

Really, cash covered puts are a way to buy the dip. Covered calls are a way to sell at your target price."
2021-04-16 18:16:36,wallstreetbets,"Congrats. Hope you set aside some money for taxes. I would say 35% of your gains minimum to be safe.

I had a $18k tax bill for $54k of gains in 2020. I big chuck of my portfolio is in IRAs retirement accounts which helps a ton."
2021-04-16 16:57:48,wallstreetbets,"> No, Max profit is no shares being called away as you keep the premium plus the underlying shares, and you can rinse and repeat this process.

Hint: you get keep the premium regardless of if or not the shares are called away. 

Hint: The value of the shares you goes up with the price of the stock.

Hint: You care about the equity value of your portfolio, not the number of shares/eggs you have.

If you still don't get it, you can think about what the fact that the maximum delta on a call option contract is 100. So, the maximum delta from being short a call is -100. The delta on holding 100 shares is always 100, therefor the delta on a short call + 100 shares is always going to be > 0. That is to say, your position is always worth more as the price goes up."

2021-04-16 14:07:44,wallstreetbets,Don't forget to relax and have a beer over the weekend
2021-04-16 09:59:18,wallstreetbets,Take a profit and GTFO.
2021-04-16 11:35:34,wallstreetbets,"RIP TO THIS LAD 

SPY saw this guy's YOLO and immediately started drilling. I had to get out while I could for my 4/16c and could have made double if I sold at open"
2021-04-16 13:24:13,wallstreetbets,Bro what in the actual fuck hahahahaha
2021-04-16 14:07:16,wallstreetbets,"For the love of all that is good, at least sell half before the weekend and a politician says something stupid and ruins your life."
2021-04-16 11:18:03,wallstreetbets,Should have done $416 on 4/16
2021-04-16 13:23:40,wallstreetbets,"At least you were smart enough to go with SPY over GME.

Not quite smart enough to go with SPX over SPY though. If this hits you'll have to pay thousands more in taxes than SPX."
2021-04-16 19:27:25,wallstreetbets,This is old school WSB! Especially playing the SPY. Respect
2021-04-16 11:23:55,wallstreetbets,You should sell. You will sincerely regret it if you don’t.
2021-04-16 10:19:59,wallstreetbets,"Go fucking hard or go home....LOVE IT!

2021-04-16 11:31:32,wallstreetbets,Can’t go tits up right?..
2021-04-16 12:35:49,wallstreetbets,"How often would you say you cycle through your “entire life’s worth?” Just curious if I’m maybe doing it wrong.

Edit: love that this is on RH, btw. Idc what anyone says, you are strong-willed."
2021-04-16 13:46:47,wallstreetbets,"Godspeed, sir."

2021-04-16 15:50:23,wallstreetbets,"Damn bro sell those things while ur ahead, or don’t and make our day on the 19th with intense gains or intense losses"
2021-04-16 18:28:06,wallstreetbets,Why do all options traders on here not understand that you can decide to buy just a few calls 😂and you don't literally have to put your life's savings into it
2021-04-16 11:25:33,wallstreetbets,I'm feeling anxious just looking at this. Please take the profit and run. You still have some extrinsic value on those options. Please don't be stupid and hold them to expiration.
2021-04-16 11:00:03,wallstreetbets,What could go wrong?
2021-04-16 11:16:47,wallstreetbets,!Remindme 3 days

2021-04-16 12:29:25,wallstreetbets,Why is the picture so blurry?
2021-04-16 15:01:23,wallstreetbets,"I hope u're selling now, if so, great move dude"
2021-04-16 15:02:24,wallstreetbets,I swear some of you roast harder than most people on r/roastme
2021-04-16 15:10:49,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, even your screenshot seems to be on life support"
2021-04-16 15:11:54,wallstreetbets,I'd take the gains today. Everyone told me holding SPY options over the weekend is generally a bad idea.
2021-04-16 15:16:28,wallstreetbets,"Lmao fuck man, godspeed. We’ve been melting up and reaching ATH for weeks and you drop 40k NOW."
2021-04-16 15:18:15,wallstreetbets,Absolute classic! Cheers!
2021-04-16 15:32:17,wallstreetbets,What's up with a 4/19 expiry?

2021-04-16 16:37:38,wallstreetbets,Holy fucking shit this is literally the opposite of any trade I would take right now.
2021-04-16 19:02:53,wallstreetbets,Maybe you should get more on margin if this doesn’t meet your risk tolerance
2021-04-16 19:38:14,wallstreetbets,My god
2021-04-16 19:57:23,wallstreetbets,Oh captain my captain

2021-04-16 10:45:04,wallstreetbets,Sell!
2021-04-16 11:50:44,wallstreetbets,Why would you do this?
2021-04-16 09:49:31,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-16 10:25:42,wallstreetbets,"I need help: I am paper trading SPY calls. I bought 5 calls, all at different expiry DTE 30+. For 4 of them I was able to set an OCO sell (limit at 16, stop at 10) but for the 5th one the order is rejected and I can’t figure out why since I’m doing the exact same thing as the others.  Maybe it is because the expiry is too far out to do GTC?  I’ve got to figure out this problem before I go from paper to real with this strategy, which seems to be working on paper"
2021-04-16 09:52:36,wallstreetbets,Did you buy these yesterday?
2021-04-16 10:23:29,wallstreetbets,Sure hope you took profits before that dip.  Not sure I'd have fingernails left in your situation.
2021-04-16 10:26:50,wallstreetbets,Some balls you have
2021-04-16 10:28:50,wallstreetbets,"Buy puts, got it"
2021-04-16 11:05:36,wallstreetbets,Thats true WSB 🙂🤙🏻
2021-04-16 11:23:52,wallstreetbets,This is ballsy.
2021-04-16 11:24:18,wallstreetbets,"You are going to feel realllly stupid unless these go ITM on Monday. Fuggg. Godspeed

Weekend theta is going to rip these to shreds, otherwise.

Just so you cant say you weren't warned: I believe there are less risky, just as good plays."
2021-04-16 11:26:38,wallstreetbets,Hope this pulls off for you man 🤝
2021-04-16 11:28:34,wallstreetbets,"Idk how these are gonna turn out, but I'm just glad you didn't get puts."
2021-04-16 12:10:40,wallstreetbets,lol roll those expirations out a month while they have value. the recall is the day after those expire.

2021-04-16 12:40:22,wallstreetbets,We all know it's going to go to $420 by 4/20 but OP likes to live dangerously tempting fate with them 4/19 expirations.
2021-04-16 12:42:21,wallstreetbets,Oh no
2021-04-16 12:48:47,wallstreetbets,"Man, take the $1100 you made and yolo it on FDs instead. At least that's money you can afford to lose.

2021-04-16 09:08:55,wallstreetbets,"Palantir was never a get rich quick.  


Palantir is just simply a company that exists before the mass wave of old heads in the gov that still mandate the use of  windows 2008 computers die off, and the newer wave understands the benefit up moving tech to something more sustainable and universally easier.

2021-04-16 08:42:04,wallstreetbets,PLTR is such a fucking massive disappointment. Somewhere along the last few months they lost their momentum and that was it.

2021-04-16 12:04:29,wallstreetbets,And here I am crying for the $600-700 that I lost on PLTR and F calls... thanks fellow wbs for cheering me up!!!

2021-04-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Norwegian Air Shuttle Hi All

Been a lurker for while, after the whole GME scene I have been looking at stocks myself lately and wanted some feed back on Norwegian Air Shuttle (NAS). Its a low budge carrier and has been through a bad patch with mismanagement.

But all that has changed recently with a management restructure, see link below.

https://travelweekly.co.uk/news/air/ex-ryanair-director-lands-new-role-at-norwegian-air

Also a restructure plan allowed by the Irish courts.

https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/norwegian-air-wins-court-approval-for-restructuring-40244734.html

This could lead to a huge share prise rise, however I was hoping for some feed back from the experts on Redditt. Any feed back would be much appreciated.

Other transport based shares like Rolls Royce and IAG have seen their share price fall over Covid. My guess all will see a rise in share prices once lock down is lifted across the European continent.

2021-04-16 12:59:06,wallstreetbets,The company have massive debt and will dillute shares soon (yet again). This is a company that have been owned by the people. Retail investors loved the stock. But they have had heavy losses after multiple share dilution. Loyal customers now hate the company for eliminating the Reward points. Will the customers and shareholders return after taking all this shit? The most experienced people of the company fled to make Flyr and Norse Atlantic. One company for domestic and one for international flights. These are companies with really smart people behind them and they are debt free. The stocks are dirt cheap. Why not bet on them instead?

The only thing that is keeping them alive now is due to the huge stimulus package the Norwegian government gave them and the bankruptcy protection they was given in a court of Ireland. Another option - if any, would be to invest in ""Flyr"" noted on Euronext Growth (Oslo Børs), it's a completely new airline started by a handful of experienced previous key-people and leaders from both SAS, Norwegian and Widerøe. No debt, huge potential - but of course risky. Look it up."

#***HOLY MOLY GUACAMOLE!***

With ♥️, the WSB mod team.

(This post brought to you by Big 🥑, in partnership with Micro 🍆)"
2021-04-16 16:23:45,wallstreetbets,"I know the decision to end these threads is disappointing, and this was an abrupt way to do it, but WSB has so much amazing content that's getting buried under GME that we had to do something.

Did you see the billionaire that was balls deep on leverage and lost $20 BILLION in a massive margin call? His liquidation caused a massive crash and major losses to the big banks. 

Did you see the tons of different non-GME YOLOs / DDs that got posted in the last week? Some of those people are probably going to go bankrupt and it would be fun to laugh at them. 

That's kind of cool stuff we want to see more of on WSB. We are WallStreetBETS after all! 

To be honest with you, it's a bit weird seeing people post share YOLOs non-stop. This sub was built on insane options plays (""FDs"") and high risk plays.

If you want to talk GME here, that's cool too, but there's now dedicated subreddits for that, like r/SuperStonk and r/GME. Check them out! You'll find more focused conversation there.

We'd like to go back to our roots of thicc gain/loss porn and busty DDs, so we're ending the GME megathreads. So long, and thanks for all the guac."

I adore all the degenerates here. I like the positions or ban requirement. Wsb was my intro to options. It told me about the jpow brrrr and the v-shaped recovery last year. I learned that TA is the best way to sound smart but be actually retarded. Wsb showed me that dividends and boomer stocks was for nerds. And it taught me how to lose money really fast and that I should always inverse myself. But in The last 3 months I’ve literally learned 5x what I knew from the past 3 years. Gme is the most interesting story of the year. This megathread was going to eventually and naturally be replaced as apes learn new plays and the gme story unfolds. It doesn’t make sense to make an executive unilateral decision to kill the thread and it just makes mods look sus af. Killing the thread only feeds the conspiracy/cultish mindset. Just like all the CNBC/motley fool/S3/etc... FUD proved to me that gme was a real threat. MODS: get a grip and use this growth as an opportunity to integrate a lot of beautiful minds so that we can collectively share the best ideas and the best gains and losses.

This sub was built on that same logic where you had a lot of people making huge yolo plays and a demand to see that...... and yet you clearly have a huge demand for GME talk yet you want to remove the supply? Why so people can see other threads? Lol

Look it’s your sub, you are the mods we are not but your following has grown you need to support it not throw it away. People come for the GME thread and stay for the other yolos. I have watched all the PLTR yolos and others posts. Closing the thread achieves nothing but hurting your following. The logic of we want people’s posts to be noticed is counter productive because many people were just attracted to this because of the GME thread and you now lose those eyes.

I’ll prob get banned for this post so 💎🦍🚀 if that happens."

Look at the volume on the 04/16 $12 strike.. It's still at 10.

2021-04-16 16:51:22,wallstreetbets,"I genuinely can’t explain it, but DFV comes across as such a genuinely nice guy. I know this will seem obvious to many, but I’m an extremely cynical person by nature. If things seem too good to be true, I’m suspicious, if people seem too good to be true, I think the worst.

Not about him though. He’s something special."
2021-04-16 17:32:49,wallstreetbets,The mods basically said we know gme is gonna moon but this sub deserves more boomer movement. We want something a little more unpredictable not something we know is gonna be moon

2021-04-16 08:48:46,wallstreetbets,"DFV’s Walter Mitty tweet?

I’ve never seen the movie, so I went to Wikipedia (where else) to get sum straight factz. What I found in the plot synopsis was, well, shocking!:

“Walter Mitty is a negative assets manager at Life magazine who daydreams of adventures... Mitty works with legendary photojournalist Sean O'Connell, although they have never met in person. O'Connell has sent Mitty his latest negatives... The negative is missing, forcing Walter to stall for time with corporate transition manager Ted Hendricks, who is handling the downsizing.”

Negatives assets going missing, and stalling for time until they can be retrieved? Sounds a lot like FTDs and naked shorts right?

There’s a ton more in there but it all gets a bit tin-foilly. ‘Negative assets’ really stood out for me, took my smooth brain a while to figure out they were talking about photos but it’s the kind of smart cryptic breadcrumb that DFV would leave for us window lickers.

TL;DR: Walter Mitty manages NEGATIVE ASSETS that GO MISSING and result in a WILD GOOSE CHASE.

And remember, it may not moon today, it may not moon next week, it may not even moon this year, but whilst there is faith, the moon is ultimately inevitable.

Anyone whining about the thread after coming in here to a stock they say that they hate - is not that bright.  That's like me watching a program on tv that I despise only to go on and cry about it.

2021-04-16 14:09:02,wallstreetbets,I bought this stock because I like it. I hold this stock because I like the business model. I will not be scared into selling. I will take these shares to the moon or the grave. There is no in between. There is no compromise. Give me tendies or give me death.
2021-04-16 14:13:59,wallstreetbets,Hope the mods are ready for the daily discussion thread to be flooded with GME on Monday. That's basically what they've guaranteed now.

I've really enjoyed reading all the comments as I continued to buy the stock. GME and WallStreet Bets are the reason I joined Reddit. I'm just as invested in this daily thread as I am in the stock. My oldest son introduced me to this rocket ride and its been a blast.

My 5 year old enjoys talking about it too, because WE LIKE THE STOCK! 

I am eagerly waiting for the trip to the moon with all my fellow apes and ! I hope I run into you in other threads. You're not only fun, but also point out where to look for more information regarding stocks and research. May we all be blessed with bananas, tendies and rocket fuel!

Still though, it’s a sad and strange plot twist in the history that will be written about all of this.  I love you guys and I’ll miss you all.  I did really learn a lot from the “popular” kids - got a good distraction during this horrible year learning about puts and calls (smart enough to know I’m too dumb to try that day trading stuff).  Anyway, we will find each other, regroup and learn new things.  All will be good."

2021-04-16 11:16:53,wallstreetbets,"Alright, u/zjz, u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR, and the rest of the mod team.

Obviously, the decision to end the GME megathreads is a controversial one. You have a lot of pressure on you, but let's get to the facts instead of opinions.

Back at the start of March, with the RKT threads people got very heated up on it, and you guys said that it would be handled automatically based on mentions, comment count, market cap, etc.

[Screenshot to the post in one of the RKT threads saying as much.](https://imgur.com/a/SFDTpZj)

Out of the blue, you guys announce that these daily threads are gonna stop. On a day where everyone is super excited for DFV's big play. If it was a coincidence it wasn't a very carefully thought-out decision.

Further, this thread makes the front page, top post every day.

zjz listed that too many pinned threads needing to shuffle is a headache. Fine, we don't need this to be pinned every day. Just leave a link in daily discussion like before, or just don't even do that. We will find this and contain ourselves to it.

Outing the community from the most active section in this sub is a decision which is implicitly against the community's wishes and best interests.

Don't force things back to the old normal. Get used to the new normal and work with it, don't fight the sentiment.

2021-04-16 10:48:00,wallstreetbets,UPVOTE IF YOU WANT THE DAILY MEGATHREAD!
2021-04-16 07:30:25,wallstreetbets,"I live in the American Gardens Building on West 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Marcus DeLongis. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself, by  keeping track of GME, having a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I’ll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. I then proceed to open my laptop and watch GME while tenderly and lovingly beating my meat. This helps to clear my mind of all dips and fud whilst keeping it soft and firm. There is an idea of a Marcus DeLongis. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there, I just like the stock."

2021-04-16 08:38:08,wallstreetbets,"Good day everyone. Back with my daily DD. Yesterday my predictions were 100% accurate. Let's predict today's price movement: 

We're *probably* going to see ups and downs anywhere between 0-1,000,000.00. Sometimes the candles will be green. Sometimes they will be red. That's what makes GME such an amazing stock. 

Stay tuned for more daily DD's. I have something big in the works."

2021-04-16 09:42:25,wallstreetbets,"Posting again for those who have just joined us.

Beware the hype around DFV's calls today. Don't set yourself up for disappointment. Today may be a flat, uneventful day, or a red day. Mentally prepare yourself for that now. We don't do dates for a reason. There has been so much disappointment at various stops on this journey due to people putting too much weight on dates. 

It will happen when it happens and the road to Tendie Town is paved with patience."

2021-04-16 10:17:33,wallstreetbets,"On this day, April 16th in 1971, a secret team of German and Swedish engineers attempted a feat only the Americans and Soviets would accomplish for many decades to come. Details of the mission were finally declassified 50 years later.

The mission team for the AFFE-Zwölf was comprised of the two experienced test pilots Hans Albrecht and Elias Hödl as well as two laboratory chimpanzees, with the goal of beating the Soviets to a possible moon landing scenario although officially only a moonshot attempt would be made.

During the mission, there was a catastrophic failure of the navigation system and Albrecht had to switch to manual controls while approaching the moon, and was able to avoid disaster with his keen visual insight to keep the craft 100km above the lunar surface. However, they would need to reduce the mass of the orbiter at their altitude to escape the moon's gravity, and Mission Control advised the two men not to descend to the surface as recovery would be impossible. They chose to place the chimpanzees into the lander and detach the module from the orbiter in order to return home to Earth while the lander made a controlled descent to the moon.

The two Germanic astronauts made it safely back to Earth, where Mission Control gave Albrecht the nickname ""Diamant"" for successfully navigating the damaged AFFE-Zwölf and landing a pair of chimpanzees on the lunar surface. As it was a secret project which violated the Potsdam agreement and would have caused tensions with the USA and Russia, information on the project was only declassified in 2021.

*TL;DR: ""Diamond"" Hans brought the apes to the moon with Hödl.*"

At this point, I've put back into this beautiful stonk every little bit of discretionary dollar I can find, and even reinvested from other places into this one.

While I understand I'm not close to what others might have in here, my 287 🎟 to the moon🌛is literally about all I can afford to do for awhile & hopefully not lose much or any of its value in the end.

I've not sold in the $400's and not planning to sell unless we all get to taste the champagne and hookers together... just wish I had an ounce more of brainmatter compared to a bonified retard 🐒 to truly know what to expect in the near future.

Never in my miserable life have I done something this crazy and blind before. However, it truly has been a nice time chillin with the gang in here.

 I checked on the browser and under margin it in deed said 'enabled'. I looked through my recent history and again there were several ""internal transfers.""I called yesterday and spoke with a really cool laid back stoner dude. He assured me my account was not margin as he was looking right at it. 

He had me check the status again and I told him it said ""margin enabled."" This must be a ""technical issue."" He assured me I would be able to vote with my shares.

I know it's not all serious, but we need a bit less ""I JUST WANNA MOON ALREADY!"" vibes. We've already won, impatience is the only thing that can cost us. 

When moon? Probably when one of the following happens:

- Share recall
- Margin call
- Forced liquidation by DTCC
- Hard intervention by the SEC

You'll notice that we have control over NONE of those. So ***hold, buy if you want, and chill.***

We've all daydreamed about getting paid to do nothing. My friends, THIS IS THAT DREAM.

2021-04-16 09:45:03,wallstreetbets,"lol remember that time i contacted a local realtor who is a friend of my family because I was *certain* I'd have the down payment for a starter home *any day now* with my GME shares mooning in January. The email I wrote to him even said some stupid shit like ""I have a risky investment that is about to potentially pay out big"" like some jackass terd burglar trying make out like I know shit about stonks.

He keeps emailing me trying to go out for lunch and to see some properties and I'm like ""eh...I'm still...like waiting bro. It's complicated. You see there's these dark pools and short ladders and shit. Wild, wild stuff. I'll have that money any day now though. Fuck Melvin. Ok later, Brian."""
2021-04-16 10:58:02,wallstreetbets,"I swear the mods lay awake at night just thinking of how they can fuck us and make the sub as unenjoyable as possible for the most people possible. This is probably the first step toward banning GME talk altogether just because they personally have lost interest. 

And you know, without the hype and camaraderie of the highly visible daily thread in the most well-known sub, GME's price could tank. This literally costs us money. Fuck you, mods."

2021-04-16 12:46:18,wallstreetbets,"Hmm yet another nonsensical decision from a wish-washy mod team it seems, very displeasing to see happen here. WSB has never been a sole stock sub reddit yet you are attempting to treat it as though gme doesnt exist, same with crypto. 

If you want to limit the exposure of related content in relation to other stock posts then just having a single daily megathread would solve that issue yet you seem to have chosen the nuclear dictator option when there is a quite large group of users trying to help each other combat the free market. 

This feels like it goes against the whole purpose of what I have come to love about wsb community. We just want to push back against a corrupt factor and make our momey back that was unrightfully stolen from us and our relatives, this removal / ban which seems to only align in favour with your specific beliefs and values seemingly goes against the whole of wsb culture. 

I would advise spending more time to consider the implications of your actions and think before moving upon them for as it is now you are actively working against the retail investor around the world. 

GME and how it plays out is going to effect the world economy is many ways, to hinder the ability of free speech for millions gathered is not beneficial in any way. 

It's very shameful how these actions are being taken.

Edit : take our back back to money back"

2021-04-16 14:43:48,wallstreetbets,Day is kinda ruined after reading whats above. Why would we be split up like that? 90% of us stay in here (daycare) and just support each other. GME STARTED on WSB so why can’t it stay?
2021-04-16 16:15:38,wallstreetbets,Are they shutting down the daily GME thread because their trying to convince us it’s over ? Because I’m not selling... this FUD is all bullshit to me... hold hold hold hold hold
2021-04-16 17:39:05,wallstreetbets,"I was pissed at first about the GME Mega being killed off... but after thinking about it, I'm bullish AF.

The logic of banning the mega (our catch all for apes) to clear up the rest of the sub from GME doesn't make sense... if anything that'll disperse the GME into the rest of the sub MORE than it already is.

However, if WSB is officially moving away from GME and no longer hosting a daily thread, that severely limits their exposure to blowback if the MOASS hits.  We know there are already 100s of articles about how ""WSB is ganging up to take on hedgies"" but if WSB takes an official position to get away from GME, it solidifies the case that they're not liable for what's about to happen, which is smart.  The same way DFV has been very reserved in what/when he posts to limit legal exposure, it's wise for WSB to take the same stance.

I look forward to watching this circus with the rest of you wherever our new home is, and hope you're all showered in tendies when this thing blasts off."

2021-04-16 16:28:59,wallstreetbets,"They have to know that a megathread helps to contain the GME discussion, which in turn allows other discussions to happen. I mean, that's the whole point of a megathread in the first place. Mods want to return to a more ""typical"" WSB, but they have to know that people aren't simply going to migrate to another sub. So they have to know that GME is inevitably going to become a disruption again without the megathread. That's exactly what happened when millions joined for GME and there was no megathread. I mean, you know this. I know this. We all know this. They *have* to know this. So why do this? Their actions don't line up with what they say their intentions are. Regardless of if they're bought out or not, they've caused a lot of unnecessary FUD and division here. And all for no gain, because they'll be forced to do one of two things: megathread or ban.

Seeing how they've handled this so far, I'm under the impression that mods will opt to ban all GME rather than reinstate the megathread."

Then this GME bullshit blows up, apes become a daily feature of my life, and just as I was really feeling like it was something real - top down authority comes in to fuck it right over.

We are holding shares.  We are still here because we believe the DD.  Things, in my opinion, look great.  I will more miss the daily shit-posting with you guys because, to be honest, during COVID lockdowns and shit things have been depressing as fuck. Talking to other people is hard enough for me without a lockdown and I appreciate all of you.

Don't let the disappointment take away from the bigger picture.  I still want to hold an ape reunion Fyre Festival so I better see you all there after this shit is over.  Stay positive."

Maybe they are a bunch of massive 🌈🐻 who have bowed to the constant moaning from the boomer OG’s? Personally I don’t think it’s the 4th option or they would have done this sooner.

One of our best employees got caught having sex with a new hire half her age. They walked past me while they were being escorted out by security & HR. I was tempted to record their walk of shame. One of our useless employees got canned too. That might be the silver lining of this week.

My trips to A.C. are always the same. I leave my wallet at my house and only take my driver’s license, a credit card that I don’t know the PIN (to avoid any moment of drunken weakness to get cash) and $300. I always go to the $10 blackjack table and I can play for hours. Sometimes I leave with no cash, sometimes with the $300 I entered with, sometimes more. It’s fun and entertaining."

Today I've learned, that red days are something different. It's when you're getting fuxed in the arse with huge red dildo. In each and every position. Doesn't depend on sector, origin or level of sentiment or hype - just bend over, here it comes, baby...baaaam, here's another - baaaam, you just sit there and cry.

2021-04-16 08:11:01,wallstreetbets,"I have a conspiracy theory. So banks have tanked on earnings for a couple of reasons, one of them is that I believe they were able to make increased profit because they took money out of their loan loss reserves. Now why would a big bank(like jpm) do that if they think a crash might be coming? The simple answer is bc they can. Jpow has been going on about how economic recovery is better than expected, no inflation, etc etc. Jamie dimon is probably one of the most tactical CEOs, everything he does is borderline tactical genius. When you see shitty companies like airlines or cruises getting government money for “being important to the economy” it’s easy to see why any big bank, which is a backbone of the us and even global economy(banking) would want to open themselves up to more risk. They have essentially a government who is willing to print any amount of money to keep this ship afloat."

Before buying PLTR stock was possible, people like us were called Flagellants. We would scourge our backs to imitate the suffering of Christ, and real bagholders among us may have been tough enough to hammer holes through their hands.

We would walk from village to
village and show our scars in exchange for a crust of bread and a pile of dry hay to sleep on. You can continue this proud tradition by showing someone at a bar your blown up portfolio in exchange for a drink."

\-Value (All boomer stocks up another 15-20%)

Then, as soon as growth starts to pick up again as their  values hit stupid lows, boomers will cash out of their value stocks at ATH, and correct the market, which will just drive growth stocks done lower."

2021-04-16 09:01:12,wallstreetbets,"Might do a more comprehensive DD/Technical post with charts later, but looking at the market currently there's some things to note:  
- Both SPY (/ES) and QQQ (/NQ) have pulled away from their 21/50 day SMAs and are a large way away from their 200 day SMA. If you look at the past year, when these gaps have widened significantly we have had a pull back, a regression to the mean.  
- We are coming down off a massive peak in GEX (gamma exposure) which will probably unwind today given the monthly opex. Edit: Forgot to mention this has generally preceded (exacerbated) volatility in the market.  
- For the last three months, the back-end of the month has been choppy to the downside, post-monthly opex it would seem.  
We could very well grind higher for another week, but if the pattern follows I would expect us to see volatility to the downside towards the end of the month, and significant at that, not just chop. Thinking %7-10 pullback is possible here."

Even though the people I was arguing with about it a week or two ago had their puts become worthless, most of the open calls - including mine rip - will also expire worthless, and I think the problem with the play was the overuse of super short dated options instead of shares.

I sold my shares to get weeklies, but now I fully regret it. Even (at least one) bear agrees that the share price will eventually reach analyst targets in the high 30s/low 40s. I've been a bull for this stock since i found out about it and it hasn't disappointed me, but I feel like if it was capable of emotions then it would be disappointed in me.

Futures are pointing a bit higher as of 0630, with small caps leading indices (Russell 2000 up 0.3%). Dow and S&P are up 0.1%. The Nasdaq is down about 0.1%.

There are more earnings on tap today, with a bunch of banks led by Morgan Stanley reporting in the pre-market. It’s been a banner earnings season so far, with just about everybody beating analyst estimates. If a company does fall short you can expect the market to punish its stock.

Nothing doing on the economic calendar for today so things may be relatively quiet barring some unforeseen news.

Commodities are pushing higher, led by the so-called “soft commodities”: Corn and soybeans are at 52-week highs this morning. Wheat is pushing higher as well. Maybe a sign of inflation concerns. Something to watch."

They’ve been going up and earnings comes May 21. Options around that date aren’t super crazy and while this may be a shock... you may actually win something instead of consistently losing on mara riot plug goev etc like I have. But it’s a bet if anyone jumps on board so you may lose too. Seems like housing isn’t going down anytime soon and people are still going to do remodeling etc.

I saw one of the prototypes charging in a parking lot last month, with like 5 dudes on their laptops inside adjusting various things and looking busy, so it's legit and not just a 3D rendering or hollow model rolling down a hill like other EV startups"

2021-04-16 06:22:00,wallstreetbets," I remember in econ class in high school we did some paper trading on some online platform.  I put all my money in Lycos and did very well.  Must have been around '99 or '00.

edit:  from wiki, lol

""Near the peak of the dot-com bubble on May 16, 2000, Lycos announced its intent to be acquired by Terra Networks, the Internet arm of the Spanish telecommunications giant Telefónica, for $12.5 billion.[12] The acquisition price represented a return of nearly 3,000 times the company's initial venture capital investment and about 20 times its initial public offering valuation.[13] The transaction closed in October 2000 and the merged company was renamed Terra Lycos, although the Lycos brand continued to be used in the United States. Overseas, the company continued to be known as Terra Networks.

Having been set back by the dot-com bubble burst, Lycos abandoned its own search crawler in late 2001, and started using FAST.[13]

In August 2004, Terra announced that it was selling Lycos to Seoul, South Korea–based Daum Communications Corporation, now Kakao, for $95.4 million in cash, less than 2% of Terra's initial multibillion-dollar investment.[13] In October 2004, the transaction closed and the company name was changed back to Lycos.[13]"""

2021-04-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMC are playing both the short and the long term game and praise the retal investors. Duh, not a financial advisor.

I loved every word of the interview with Adam Aron. He seems to be watching the market volume closely and plan his actions accordingly.

Quote from the article:

*""the movie-theater chain is once again “under attack” from short sellers after skirting bankruptcy during the Covid-19 pandemic.*  *The volume of short sales — bets that the stock will go down — rose about 50% in March to 73.8 million shares* *""*

Now, I'm not a market guru but I still believe that AMC are severely undervalued and heavily shorted. Yes, they've accumulated some debt but so have others and they survived through the worst of the pandemic one way or another, which means that the only way to go is UP.

If anything, they are on route to become winners after the pandemic since the ArcLight Cinemas and Pacific theatres have announced plans to close permanently.

*""Other theaters have succumbed to the Covid-19-struggle. ArcLight Cinemas and Pacific Theatres, two jointly owned California movie-theater chains, announced plans this week to close permanently, underscoring the still-tenuous state of the industry.""* 

The heavily discussed topic about the announcement to vote for the right to sell 500 million shares, which lead to significant price drop and short selling activity, has also been discussed by Adam Aron. The response:

*""If investors at the May 4 annual meeting approve the plan for additional stock, he’ll gain flexibility to buy back debt at a discount or acquire another chain at an attractive price, which would counteract any dilution.""*

And more importantly:

*""Aron, who has long been known as outspoken, also praised the internet investors who see themselves as fighting against “conventional” market participants, like short sellers who profit when stock prices decline. He connected with Collins, who offers online investment commentary under the username Trey’s Trades, after his 30-year-old son saw a tweet that Collins had sent to his nearly 50,000 followers, known as “apes.”*

*“My hat’s off to you,” Aron said. “I’m well aware that you have been talking about AMC a lot over the last few months and you have, you know, hundreds of thousands of subscribers, tens and tens of thousands of people watching your shows on the YouTube channel,” Aron said.*

*“I actually work for you,” he said, “and for that reason it’s a special reason for me to engage with all of you.”*

Read the last paragraph again. He works for us. So is every CEO on this goddamn planet that you guys have stocks in and hold long term. But he is the one who publicly acknowledged it. 

In summary:

1. Adam Aron acknowledged the rising activity in short selling which influences the price. 
2. He acknowledges the debt so he is acting accordingly.
3. Competition (at least on the west coast) reduced.
4. He works for the ""apes"".
5. No plans to immediately sell the 500 million shares they announced. If things get tough, they have the right to sell 43 million shares to cover debt which means bankruptcy is NOT on the cards.

It was a tough year for the theatre giant but CEO Adam Aron believes in a bright future. It was a one in a generation economic and health crisis but AMC survived. The only way to go is UP.

P.S. Don't take this as a guarantee. Like many others here, It is my personal DD, not a financial advise. Stay safe. Link: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-rises-ceo-clarifies-154113824.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-rises-ceo-clarifies-154113824.html)"
2021-04-16 06:15:41,wallstreetbets,">Yes, they've accumulated some debt but so have others and they survived through the worst of the pandemic one way or another, which means that the only way to go is UP.


Stocks only go UP. 👍💯💞🤑🥇

I own some AMC...I have a vested interest in this company going up....but that singular comment by the OP - early on  - completely shows a lack of understanding of the market."
2021-04-16 12:02:00,wallstreetbets,"I only bet what I can afford to lose which is why I don't have much in AMC. But what I do have there is because they appear to be the only movie theater holding on. They're the only ones open around here. Hollywood is sitting on blockbusters until people can get out. I feel like the time is coming and when those movies hit, people are going to have AMC as their only choice to go see them. Unless of course HBO Max/Disney release to home becomes a real thing. Then I didn't lose that much anyway...  


Plus Hollywood is a super rich powerful industry. My conspiracy theory is WB bought DC comics because the Stargirl series hit too close to home on Hollywood's super secret plan to build a giant brainwashing machine to make use all go to the theaters again. I bet it's based off the same tech MTV was investigating when they made that ""mow the lawn"" commercial."
2021-04-16 04:42:54,wallstreetbets,"AMC is not going to go under. The film industry where I live is absolutely slammed right now because the studios are all trying to line up their content for next year - making up for lost time. Literally everyone with experience on set is working full time, which is unheard of. There’s going to be a deluge of new movies next year. Not to mention every single person I know has mentioned to me how much they miss going to the theater. It’s going to explode when the shit fully reopens."
2021-04-16 11:36:49,wallstreetbets,"When I bought AMC I was under no illusions that it was going to shoot up to some great price immediately.  I bought it expecting to hold it for a year, or possibly 2, depending on how recovery works out.  There is only really one terrible move I could believe possible, but I think it unlikely: If they try to force a Sophie's choice between digital distro and theater distro.  If they do that, or show signs of being willing to do that, I am out immediately.  Record stores did that with iTunes.  Do not fight the Internet.  They do media distribution better than any professional organizations, even when doing it for free as a side hobby.  It's not a valuable service.  The value of theaters is NOT in making films available to the public.  Their value lies in other aspects of their business (the giant sound systems, huge screens, opportunity for teenagers to escape their parents, providing a social experience, and more) and they will coexist just fine.  If they just stick with it, it will turn out to be a good investment as it returns to its pre-pandemic valuation, no question in my mind about that."

2021-04-16 13:37:02,wallstreetbets,I'm currently red on AMC overall but quite bullish and only have plans to buy more as long as it's under $20-25. However I think it will be a year or so before it's solidly back in the mid-teens so I'm selling quite a few CC's at or just above my break even.
2021-04-16 06:20:10,wallstreetbets,"In 2019 AMC had 100M shares outstanding. 
In March of 2021 AMC has 450M shares outstanding.

AMC was burning cash for the last 5 years, way before covid. Even if Covid effectively ends completely today, what makes you people think it will all of a sudden be a cash generating profitable business? 

Now CEO wants to approve a possible 500M more shares??? After diluting it 4:1 in the last 2 years. Sheesh.

Huge debt, share dilution out the ass, and a business model that hasn't changed. How is this undervalued? 
In terms of Market Cap, AMC is higher than it was 4 years ago. 

I know you robinhood dummies click ""5year"" chart and see $30 and think ""oooo it can get back there"" but don't realize YOU ARE ALREADY THERE if you take into account the share dilution. You were at $30 with 100M shares. Now you're at $10 with 450M shares! Do some math."
2021-04-16 04:49:58,wallstreetbets,"Sounds fishy to me.  1st they ask to double the amount of shares.    Then CEO claims they won't use them.  Now claiming they are under attack by shorts.

Of course you did. It was a sales pitch specifically targeted at ripping off retail investors. A flat price when the shares have been diluted 400% is an inflated price. People going back to the movies is something that everyone knows about, it was already priced in before AMC started dumping shares.

These guys weren't making money when film revenues were hitting the stratosphere before COVID, they aren't going to suddenly start making money now. MOVIES will survive, but the high-overhead AMC theater concept might not. This is an industry that hasn't been able to profit from more people going to movies than ever before. They don't have a plan to save their business, they have a plan to cash in on retail investors."
2021-04-16 11:39:35,wallstreetbets,"so I mean you guys can do what you want, its your money, but if you weren't paying attention before the pandemic even hit movie theaters were struggling financially and there was serious concern that movie theaters were dying off.

2021-04-16 11:11:47,wallstreetbets,"HboMax is AMCs largest enemy now. If Legendary looses the push for Dune theatrical only, AMC will humpty dumpy. I prefer the streaming venue and I think theaters are more of a nostalgic enterprise now. The death of theaters means the death of multimillion dollar actor paychecks and director shares worth tens of millions, the things that created predatory organizations like AMC,who ate all competing, small town, theaters, creating 20.00 popcorn and 12.00 cokes :)

Cycle of life exists even in business. At least with HboMax I can enjoy my 60 cent can of coke. Imagine 50 million people watching at home, paying a monthly fee that equates to 1 ticket price, drinking a 60 cent coke,vs a 12.00 coke. Thats $570m that people are spending somewhere else.

From a stock point, make it while you can. From a consumer point, burn. And when the cycle starts over and streaming is 50.00 a month or up, technology will deliver the next cycle of life balancer I'm sure.

Not stock advice, just a guy who hates 20.00 popcorn and 12.00 cokes when he takes his 7 grandkids to see a movie."

2021-04-16 11:43:15,wallstreetbets,"Streaming is much closer to video rental than it is to going to cinema.

From a cost perspective, there's a large upfront cost to purchasing a quality TV + sound system. That setup has to be renewed every ~ 5 years. 

Plus subscribing to A-list is actually cheaper than renting PVOD or subscribing to all streaming services that may offer new film release (Disney +, HBO max, Paramount +, Peacock)."

I don't understand why people don't understand it cost them a fuck ton to upgrade from the old fashion seats theatres had to the new larger and more comfortable and sometimes motorized chairs. They lose a few seats per theater doing this, switching to the much preferred assigned seating giving a much better film going experience. AMC is going to come out of 2021 with a very strong 2020 box office kicking off in the summer as all the pent up people want to get back to watching films on a huge screen with a massive audio system.

We're more likely to see shorter exclusivity windows. However, movies make most of their revenues in the first 3 weekends, so I don't think that shorter windows will impact theatres that much.

Theatres are in the concession business. Subscription like A-list act as a sunk cost to incite viewers to go to the theatre and purchase food and alcohol."

And if that's the main driving point behind why their business will boom then your setting yourself up for failure. Before covid existed AMC was burning cash hand over first, just look at their earnings report. Just because they got new seats don't mean they're gunna start printing money. 

Overall their business model has not changed. And just becuase YOU want to go to movies, doesn't mean every previous movie-goer will continue going as streaming from home is more popular by the day. 

Maybe if their balance sheet was total garbage they wouldn't have needed to dilute shares herendously to re-do theaters. Ooof imagine actually have cash in hand, who would have thought. But for AMC it was their only option due to crippling debt. 

Goodluck man"

If a company is performing badly, that will be the reason people lose their job, not becuase someone shorted the stock lol.

Bears or bulls, idc what tour thesis is, the point is to make money. End of story.

Also, how is this ANY different post-pandemic than pre-pandemic? Movie theaters were a shit investment before lockdowns, and after rounds of stimulus and not being able to go to theaters, people are far more likely to have upgraded their TVs.

So somehow theaters are going to be a good investment post-pandemic, as Americans flush with cash are able to afford nice things for their homes, because why exactly?"

Market cap wise, AMC is above what it was 4 years ago. 

All for a company borderline on bankruptcy. The fact that they didn't shut there doors during the pandemic is viewed as a ""win"" shows just how bad of a position the company is in. The fact the CEO needs to go online with a YouTube to ask shareholders to vote ""yes"" shows just how bad things are.

I think both of these can still happen but giving yourself a bonus is outrageous. Then, trying to weasel more shares makes me think this management is too stupid too realize how bad they are at running a business.

2021-04-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Tech Industry Stock Compensation or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Insider Selling (PLTR) **EDIT: TL;DR - everyone I see talking about stock compensation in tech (especially companies just coming public) or insider selling around earnings/tax season seems to have an incredible lack of context for how compensation works in Silicon Valley tech. I'm here to give you an insider perspective.**

I posted this in the PLTR sub in response to a lot of threads I saw about insider selling and complaints about stock compensation models in tech companies. Figured I'd also post it here for anyone interested in my take (as a tech worker) on these things.

Okay the title is somewhat misleading because I don't necessarily **love** insider selling, but I've seen a lot of posts here and elsewhere especially on insider selling and I've found there's a misconception of stock-based compensation and selling by insiders. To preface, I am a software engineer for a large cap tech company and this is my take on stock-based compensation in the tech world and some basic things that I think all people should be aware of when it comes to this compensation and the insider selling that accompanies it.

To start I'll give a little background on the way stock compensation works for people on the ground. The grunts like me who do the normal day-to-day boring coding that enables the apps and products you use. I'll be using mostly the FAANG companies as examples of established public companies and the kind of compensation you see there.

&#x200B;

**First things first: how does stock compensation work for most of these people?**

At most of these companies stock compensation is typically most heavy in the technical organizations of the company. That is to say, engineers are being compensated primarily in equity in the company in raw dollar terms, in some cases well over 50% of their yearly income. ***This difference is usually most prevalent in the first four years of employment.***

Why is that last sentence true? Because your initial grant of equity is typically one of the largest in order to ""get you in the door."" The cliff, as tech workers call it, at four years is the time at which an engineer will typically experience a net decrease in their overall income due to the fact that one of the largest grants they received expires at this time and their refresher grants are not as sizeable in dollar terms (excepting the most outstanding performers and the most rapid promotions, but these are very rare).

As a matter of fact, it's a well-known and oft-used strategy to bail from a company after your four year cliff and move to another or SIMPLY REAPPLY TO THE SAME COMPANY FOR ANOTHER INITIAL GRANT. Yes, this happens. I know people personally who have done it. You could call it mercenary behavior.

Personally, my total compensation every year is comprised of approximately 51% equity, 6.5% bonus, and the remaining 42.5% in salary (accounting for the current share price). And here's the important note about that: ***I am not by any means a stellar performer at the company***. I am at a senior level and meeting expectations well for my job and role but I am not in the upper bands of the most highly compensated individuals as a result of either stellar or lucky performance. I am well past my 4 year cliff though it doesn't matter, because I didn't begin my career as an engineer, which actually cost me a lot of money transferring to engineering. Remember those initial grants engineers get? Transfers don't get those. Point being: I am a decent engineer doing good work and my compensation is still driven mostly by equity. If I were getting much higher ratings, the percentage of my compensation driven by equity would be substantially larger.

Everything you've just read is pretty industry standard for these large caps as mentioned.

&#x200B;

**Why is this such standard behavior in many companies?**

Isn't the answer obvious? If most of your highly lauded compensation is in stock you are driven to help your company succeed. And depending on your equity grant type maybe even more so.

Remember above how I said that the yearly equity I receive is currently 51% of my total compensation. That's because the share price is where it is. If tomorrow the share price drops by 50%... well that would be bad. You know what would make it worse? The fact that the other load of stock I have in the company isn't vested and just dropped SIGNIFICANTLY in value and depending on what triggered the drop could be heading towards zero.

That's because the company doesn't hire you and just hand you a fat stack of stock. You vest a portion of it over time, regularly. Industry standard for many of these companies is now that you vest a grant over 4 years at 1/16th each quarter. So for me, right around earnings season I get 1/16th of each grant I've received for the previous 4 years. The point of this is clearly to keep me invested and to keep me driving for my own success by advocating for and working on the best things for the business.

&#x200B;

**What kind of stock grants are there?**

There are lots. But I'll quickly go over the one that people like Alex Karp deal with (joining a company well before going public) and the one I'm most familiar with: RSUs.

With RSUs, it's a pretty simple thing: the company will give you stock every quarter!

Okay so it's not quite this simple but close, and most importantly this is a taxable event - I'll talk about this next. The company hands you a cash bonus (basically) to buy the stock at the current market price and then you exercise that to buy the stock. Awesome! Except... you just got more income... and you have now locked all that money up in shares of your company. Uncle Sam would like a word with you about this.

With people like Alex Karp the situation is even more interesting: they are given options to the stock in the company. What does that mean? Exactly what you think it does. They are issued long call options with expirations and strikes against the stock. Alex Karp is in this situation now - he has over 60m options expiring that give him the ability to buy Palantir shares at the strike. However, the current price of the shares is well above his strike and the company is giving him compensation in the form of allowing him to buy the shares at their market rate for his strike. Uncle Sam would now like a word with Mr. Karp.

&#x200B;

**So how do these taxes work?**

My company uses a sell to cover model. What does this mean? When I am issued shares my company will simply sell some of those shares after they are purchased in order to send the proceeds to the IRS. What this value represents is the expected value of the tax I would pay on the bonus I was granted to purchase the shares at the current market rate. Basically, I would sell 35% of my shares instantly to cover the expected 35% tax I would owe on the bonus I was granted to purchase the shares. This is pretty straightforward and for someone like me doesn't even really register as insider selling because it's not large enough in quantity and I'm not C suite or any of that. But this is a form of insider selling that is automatic to cover taxes. Read this if you want: [https://thefinancebuff.com/rsu-sell-to-cover-deconstructed.html](https://thefinancebuff.com/rsu-sell-to-cover-deconstructed.html)

With options it's a bit different because the income to purchase the stock (the bonus) would be the difference between the strike price of the calls given to the employee and the current price of the stock. So Alex Karp's over 60m shares are currently valued at well over a billion dollars. But that means the relative income that the company provided to cover his stock purchase is almost the entire value of the stock (his strikes are really low). Now he has a FUCK ALL MASSIVE TAX BILL on the income he was granted to purchase the stocks.

So when he exercises these options and then you read about him selling a few million shares, remember this - he is obligated to pay a 37% tax on the income granted to him to purchase those shares that he can either pay with his own money, selling a portion of his grant, or offsetting in some other way.

&#x200B;

**These grants given to employees are not just brand new shares**

I've seen a bit of confusion about stock compensation specifically here so I'm going keep it short on this point - this sort of compensation is not just NEW SHARES FOR EVERY NEW GRANT!@!@!!!@@ That's not how it works. Dilution and new share issuance is a thing - but it's not the norm. If you're asking why they keep giving stock to people to work for them and that's why you think the price is dipping on things re-read this portion.

&#x200B;

**Insider selling is predictable**

Why is this? Most of these people are using 10b5 plans to schedule their stock sales. Insiders are locked out of trading their own stock or even related derivatives the vast majority of the time. That includes grunts like me. Most stock sales that I conduct are for reinvestment purposes and taxes (these are automatic). But the common trait is they all happen after earnings because that's when our lockup period expires and we are granted our new shares. That's why you see people like Zuckerberg, Thiel, Pichai, Bezos, etc. selling at the same time all the time or as a result of a scheduled release. Think of a 10b5 as dollar cost averaging but for the sell side.

&#x200B;

**Parting thought**

One of the main reasons I don't freak out when I see insider selling like we've seen here (unless it's dickhead Chamath and his SPACs which I won't touch because fuck that toolbox) is that I see this sort of sell-off all the time and because I understand a bit of the problem space Palantir is in. I actually used to work on the problem that got them to start this company while they were at PayPal: payments fraud. I also know that the industry really, really doesn't know how to handle problems like this as effectively as they think and that there are untapped places where software like this would be invaluable. Even in my own work, I can think of almost a half dozen places where this would be directly relevant to MY role in a large cap. I can only imagine the value if it were company wide.

***Also, you guys know how I look at companies that try to recruit or poach me if they're not public companies?*** When I get messages from these series A and series B folks or stealth startups I almost always go in to look at what their growth potential is. I look at it as though I'm trying to do a value investment. What is their TAM? What will it be next year? What is their current valuation? How has it changed in their funding rounds? What sort of people work there and would I expect to build an amazing company with a ton of deep value with people like that? How do their finances and board structure look to me? Is this going to be attractive to other investors? Is the product they are offering going to be the best? Can I make it that?

What do all those questions boil down to: ***WHERE THE FUCK IS THEIR STOCK GOING?!***

Because here's the thing, most grunts like me who leave our cushy large cap jobs for places like this are doing so knowing full well that we are taking a pay cut. What are we looking for? To create the deep value that is going to drive that stock value way up and offer the best product so that the paper money we are promised to get in the door turns into some real money. What drives us to make it better? Knowing that we have more paper money left on the table that we also want to be worth something. That and most of us leave jobs for paper money for problems we love. Problems we think about at night. Problems that we think will change something drastically."

>**Why is this such standard behavior in many companies?**

>Isn't the answer obvious? If most of your highly lauded compensation is in stock you are driven to help your company succeed. And depending on your equity grant type maybe even more so.

Working hard towards the business goals and being invested in your companies success is what you receive a salary for. The equity chunk isn't to make you feel more invested in what you're working on. It's there to dissuade you from departing the company on your own terms.  If you know you are forfeiting 200k  in options over the next 4 years by leaving for a new role elsewhere, you're going to be much less likely to look to go elsewhere. And more likely to ask for higher equity grants from potential competitors if you do receive an offer. That's my perception of it anyways, and I resented the shit out of companies for the practice. It's genius, but I resented it."

2021-04-16 04:12:56,wallstreetbets,"That's a completely fair take on it and I think it's definitely a matter of perspective. I'm half in, half out on your interpretation. Primarily because I've seen plenty of people negotiate with their outstanding equity for very large grants elsewhere to get in the door. You don't ever get paid out 100% (at least from anything I've ever seen) but it is a decent bargaining chip. And for me, I think it discourages me from chasing paper money except with extreme caution. I'd have no trouble looking at FAANG level companies though because I know what I'm trading for what, and again that whole 4 year cliff thing means that the next company's initial grant might actually eclipse a large part of your outstanding grant as is meaning you'd catch up quick. However, I would say that for people who have options, it's definitely in their interest to ensure that their company is worth more than the notional value of their options since those people must pay out of pocket for their company stock. If they have expirations I think the motivation is a bit heavier too. However, that being said, most options I've ever seen have been in low dollars or fractions thereof so if you're company isn't headed to zero you're probably usually safe.  


Thanks for your take on this. Always helpful to have others who work under these models provide input."

During the GME saga he used the bad PR for Robinhood to pimp SoFi which has had its own bag of problems, he pimped out SPCE and joined as a chairman only to dump his entire stake in the company for ""liquidity"", and he famously became super wealthy in part due to his involvement in the early days of Facebook. Now he goes on TV and shits on FB for the culture of the company which he was absolutely one of the key architects of.

He's not on your side or anyone else's really. He's on his own side. Which isn't a bad thing. But I think people should know what they're getting into when they listen to assholes like that.

I fucking hate doing taxes with an adult job.

And stock compensation comes with many, many problems IMO. Like sure if your company IPOs then nice you get a big payday. But stock compensation is also heavily, heavily skewed towards the company higher ups. The CEO might only make twice the salary of an engineer, but how they take home 100x the money is the stock based compensation. As much as I've benefitted from stock based compensation, I feel like it's def one of the drivers of rising inequality."
2021-04-16 15:58:24,wallstreetbets,"That's what people don't seem to understand. You are taxed on that income. Like if I bring in $160k a year in equity, I'm liable for the taxes on $160k. If my salary is $180k, I've already taken out the maximum I can for my 401k and I pay taxes on the remaining $160k which let's be nice to me and just call it $50k. Oh and I don't pay state income tax either. So I have $110k left and if I DON'T sell any stock to cover my taxes I owe an additional $50k of taxes. So now the only raw cash I have left is about $60k and the rest is locked up in equity. Selling some of your shares to cover taxes is about the most normal and predictable thing in the world. On top of that the more equity you are granted the higher the likelihood that you must sell some in order to cover because the chunk of your salary that that tax bill eats up year over year is much larger. I know people at my company who would have to forward their entire paycheck to the government if they weren't selling some of their stock to cover those liabilities.

For anyone following along, those numbers I just gave here are generous in assuming a lower tax rate than I'm at just for the sake of round numbers and they also completely ignore the places where you pay state income tax."

2021-04-16 09:50:26,wallstreetbets,"Some people sell immediately, yeah. I do actually try to time it better at the times I do sell and sometimes I don't sell at all for quite some time. I still have a sizeable position in my own company but I don't keep all my eggs in one basket. Since my compensation is heavy on equity I reinvest a good portion of it into things that I think have steeper trajectories or are further from their ceilings. I think that's just smart investing.

The best way to think of it is this. Suppose your shares were cash today would you spend every dime on your own company? If not sell what you wouldn't and buy something else and leave the rest there. A bit of my equity paid a down payment on my house two years ago. And now market rate on my house is not 400k like when I bought, its closer to 500 to 550. My company has done well over that time too which is why I still have a couple hundred thousand in them and why I'm still there working to vest the rest of my stock."
2021-04-16 14:27:15,wallstreetbets,"That usually happens with ESPP. Since you get a 15% discount between the lowest stock price at the start of ESPP window and end of ESPP window.

It is just a safe bet to get guaranteed 15 % return.


It really depends, my previous company had open windows of around 15 days after earnings and almost everyone I knew sold their ESPP ASAP. I got 300 RSU for joining and every year I got another 100 RSU. Same vesting schedule 25% each year. 


The company before that offered either 600 RSU or 300 options, along with ESPP and that company went from a $14 stock in 2013 to $200 stock as of today.

2021-04-16 02:54:55,wallstreetbets,"I think you're confusing the right to sell stock versus the right to exercise options. Most employees (in the options case) vest their options over time or against certain valuations of the stock itself. That means they get the right to exercise some block of options after a certain milestone. Most commonly for people like me this is employment tenure.  


The sell locks are on the equity they actually have in the company - which they only get by purchasing on the open market when not subject to a trading freeze or by exercising their options and buying them on their own that way."
2021-04-16 12:20:53,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I sort of wish that I had this option with my company. I feel like I'm plenty informed to make a decision on whether I'd prefer to keep shares and pay taxes on them outright knowing that what I expect to be large growth will be happening in the future from the current price. Like if company vests were happening last year around the bottom of the market, that would have been a great time for me to be able to say, no, I'd rather you give me all the shares of this company and I will pay the taxes on the gross value of 40k this quarter because I honestly expect the value of all these shares to be 70 or 80k by this time next year. But that's a pretty complicated system to implement so I think the standard is a company decides on the tax policy for this sort of thing for all of their employees and applies it equally across all of them, at least regionally."

2021-04-16 16:13:20,wallstreetbets,Yes it was very insightful. I will now have to talk to my company's management about going public.

2021-04-16 15:15:50,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the input, I'll do some digging into this chap."
2021-04-16 10:09:20,wallstreetbets,"Yes I get that, thanks. Can you just confirm though, are these existing shares in the float that the company is effectively buying, or are they ""printing"" new shares for this purpose?"
2021-04-16 11:19:54,wallstreetbets,"Luckily i have the same strike for end of June, then a $35 for August and a $40 for November...i have hopes for a spike that will bring the Jun ones close to be ITM, pretty much gave up on May, kinda worried about August and November. In hindsight, i should really re-evaluate how much OTM i go when buying options!"
2021-04-16 14:51:38,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty confident that if I ever get audited for some reason by the feds they'll find that they actually owe me about $500 dollars from my 2015 taxes and that will be all. And it's because I fucked up filing my 1099-B from that year one of the first times I sold my company stock.
2021-04-16 19:09:51,wallstreetbets,Agreed with the other person who replied.  If somebody wants to miss out on all the value by providing because they're too lazy (or dumb) to read it all then fuck them.

2021-04-16 19:56:39,wallstreetbets,"One thing I’m planning to do to effectively minimise my taxes every time I’m given a new grant, is that I will go and buy shares during the next trading window equal to approximately 45% of the value granted. (45% is the top marginal tax rate in Australia). These shares then effectively cover the taxes that will be paid over the next 4 years, regardless of how high the share price rises.

The risk is that the share price drops significantly below the grant price, but I’ve still effectively capped my losses in that case and I still have around the same number of shares that were granted."
2021-04-16 03:53:46,wallstreetbets,What else can you do? You literally explained this in the most thorough way possible. You can't use more words to fix this. You have to accept some of us here are really really retarded.
2021-04-16 10:47:45,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes you can't explain stuff to people no matter how hard you try. 

Thank you for the DD op very informative"
2021-04-16 02:38:57,wallstreetbets,"Wtf r u talking about? That makes no sense at all. How do you have a tax liability without a taxable event? The way you just explained it you’re inducing a tax event to cover half of a mythical liability. I’m impressed on your ability to double down on your bullshit, but now it’s just twice the bullshit."
2021-04-16 01:58:09,wallstreetbets,So four years with a one year initial vest used to be the standard with vests occurring quarterly thereafter. The industry switched to immediate quarterly vests upon acceptance of a grant as talent started gravitating towards companies paying out stock earlier and earlier in an employee's career. When I started the typical schedule was what you're referring to.
2021-04-16 02:00:33,wallstreetbets,"But also yeah, monthly vs quarterly vests and stuff is definitely down to company to company. But the overarching theme is initial large grants, followed by smaller refresher grants, staggered over 4 years. Thanks for adding another data point to this."
2021-04-16 10:13:49,wallstreetbets,"Long 3,200 shares and a bunch of 2023 LEAPs."
2021-04-16 10:12:56,wallstreetbets,Yeah that's not how it works. These shares are being bought on the open market. Companies do issue new stock though but for stuff like this that is very much not the norm.
2021-04-16 02:44:55,wallstreetbets,"Did you even read the post itself? Exercising options or getting RSUs from a company is a taxable event and the taxable amount is the granted value to exercise the options or purchase the security. So if a person has 5,000 calls with a strike of $0.10 for stock that is currently trading at $40 per share then their taxable income is $39.90 \* 500,000 if they exercise all of their options contracts meaning they owe taxes on nearly $20m dollars of income.  


Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it's bullshit. Trust me, I've been paying enough taxes on these events you think aren't taxable for the last decade to know. Maybe I should have you prepare my forms, hotshot."
2021-04-16 11:35:57,wallstreetbets,When you say the industry - do you mean startups or FAANGs?
2021-04-16 10:37:48,wallstreetbets,Slowly getting more!
2021-04-16 02:46:59,wallstreetbets,"Yes, exercising the option is a tax event. The point of your post as I interpreted it was, that insiders exercising options ain’t so bad. My point is, yes it is."
2021-04-16 12:14:27,wallstreetbets,Mostly FAANG types for the RSU portions. Most people I know in start up land are receiving options for the company. Industry though I do mean pretty much everyone and that applies mostly to the idea that a huge driver of compensation in tech is the belief in a company's stock value or the current realized value of the stock of publicly traded companies.
2021-04-16 02:50:53,wallstreetbets,"Exercising options to buy their stock? As opposed to what, letting them expire? A lot of compensation plans like these CEOs are not options in perpetuity. I've known lower level employees who get options in perpetuity in their contracts but what in your opinion should a person with millions of expiring options to buy their own stock do?"
2021-04-16 11:50:28,wallstreetbets,Are the shares from exercising C-level execs bought on the open market just like RSUs or from dilution?
2021-04-16 12:17:21,wallstreetbets,"It depends on the stage of the company basically. Dilution and share issuance often occurs early in the funding process as new investors and people come aboard a fledgling company. After a company goes public share issuances are less likely to occur, although they can for a ton of reasons. But generally speaking, people getting RSUs and exercising options are doing so on the open market. Hence the pressure for people in private companies to eventually take a company public or to seek to generate enough value to be bought out or whatever their aim is. The idea is that all that paper money on the table eventually becomes worth something and usually that cap structure is decided well before a company becomes public."

2021-04-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Rite Aid ( RAD ) Got Slaughtered When Earnings Were Released - Was It Warranted OK, OK, OK --- I know that Rite Aid had a bad Q4 due to the spike in COVID-19 infections that kept a large portion of the nation on lockdown, the reported weather and logistics issues, and most of all the weak cold and flu season (--Hey, everyone stayed home and wore a mask when out, so no one got sick with the cold or flu).  OK, Q4 is now in the rearview mirror, and the stock is trading below $18 per share.  Is that price warranted?  Some points to consider:

1) The market cap of the stock is now right around one billion dollars.  Does that sound reasonable for a company with $24 billion in annual revenue, positive cash flow, and $8 per share in adjusted EBITDA (during a COVID-19 stressed year, no less)?

2) The company provided guidance for the new / current Q1 of their 2022 fiscal year and indicated a break-even result +/- $10 million.  This represents a net earnings improvement of $63 to $83 million versus the prior year.

3) RAD management indicated they had administered 2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first six weeks of the new / current fiscal year.  Through the first half of the year, it appears 6 million doses will likely be delivered by Rite Aid.  This will result in $210 million in incremental revenue and $2 per share to net earnings.   Also, Pfizer's CEO mentioned today (April 15, 2021) that a third booster coronavirus shot will likely be required and that we should expect the COVID-19 vaccine to be administered annually like the flu shot.

4) The short attacks on the stock have ramped up this month leading into the earnings announcement.  On March 31, 2021 the short interest was 15.1%.  Not the highest we've ever seen, not by a long shot.  However, shorts are becoming more agressive in recent days:

* April 15th - 1,571,592 shares shorted (25.69% short volume ratio)
* April 14th -    379,924 shares shorted (16.61% short volume ratio)
* April 13th -    700,706 shares shorted (30.70% short volume ratio)
* April 12th -    135,778 shares shorted (15.36% short volume ratio)

5) Bartell Drugs acquisition just recently closed.  Unlikely to contribute to net earnings during the current fiscal year, but is expected to do so next year.  The acquisition makes Rite Aid the pharmacy leader in the Seattle market.

6) Year-to-Date high share price is $32.48 and there are only 55 millioin shares total outstanding.

7) The company has $3.1 billion in debt, which is being adequately managed (---meaning Rite Aid was able to service the debt, buy Bartell drugs, and still maintain positive cash flow last year).  For the new / current fiscal year, it appears likely that Rite Aid is positioned to book positive net earnings and cash flow (improving cash flow even further).

8) Break-up value of the company is likely in the range of $40 - $50 per share.

Does this sound like a company that should be trading at less than $18 per share with a market cap of just $1 billion?

Don't hesitate to pile on with the abuse.  After today, I am used to it."

RAD is still a crappy pharmacy but it’s not worth it’s stock price now. They literally bought a Seattle pharmacy chain. Their insurance company (which Walgreens doesn’t even own one of) is super profitable.

2) amazon decides they need to buy a pharmacy to get into the pharmacy business

That's it.  Both options result in a merger/acquisition.  Those are the only two ways forward and they're not necessarily mutually exclusive (nobody talks about Amazon getting into the pot business).  The fact they're not in Florida means they will suffer through the coming demographic decline."

Thats 20m customers max. If each of those gambles 50 usd a week (bets not loses).... and the gross win margin is 10pc (in the UK it is 7pc)... then the total revenue for these companies is 5.6bn.

2021-04-15 23:16:39,wallstreetbets,Why don’t you just flush your money instead
2021-04-16 05:50:25,wallstreetbets,"I really don’t understand how people do this after stock dilution. If you price that in, the stock would be around 30? So that means, 10 dollar right now would be 30 without the extra shares on the market. Does that seem like a normal price to you for a company full of debt? I may be sceptic but just seems like it doesn’t add up."
2021-04-16 04:34:34,wallstreetbets,Honestly I feel like AMC as a company itself is managed terribly.
2021-04-16 04:33:04,wallstreetbets,please refrain from posting pictures of your child. GODSPEED

2021-04-16 09:57:47,wallstreetbets,Poor guy probably saw some random streamer saying it was going through the roof today.  Bought at the top of a green day and will be asking when he's supposed to sell before noon.  haha
2021-04-16 01:10:37,wallstreetbets,What’s your cost basis?
2021-04-15 23:11:59,wallstreetbets,I came *twice*

Retards get rich here bud.. way of the future"
2021-04-16 13:26:44,wallstreetbets,"I hold a position on AMC as well, but it's definitely not the only play. My opinion is that it's popularity came from being super cheap in comparison, and people rushed in because of it. No clue how high it could go, but there's a lot of float carried by people who will be amazed at just double their buy-in.  Time will tell, but I still hold just in case."
2021-04-15 22:47:46,wallstreetbets,Way
2021-04-15 22:39:38,wallstreetbets,Shit!

2021-04-16 01:38:58,wallstreetbets,Well done sir
2021-04-15 23:57:58,wallstreetbets,This is only a 30% gain on an option. I thought this was wall street bets

2021-04-16 12:28:29,wallstreetbets,"I know you probably get this a lot but I personally would sell all Tesla stocks ASAP. They are already behind the big German manufacturers in many aspects and the flood of new models from them won't stop anytime soon. People can keep saying *something something Apple* all they want, Tesla still is not making any profits and likely won't on the future. Just saying."
2021-04-15 22:10:07,wallstreetbets,Well Fuck me Happy Monday Handsome yo
2021-04-16 00:03:17,wallstreetbets,"Price target for Options Friday... $700-$730 based on the curve.  Some lady sold shares in TSLA after giving it a huge upgrade. She took the coin and bought coin. I used my brain and thought ""what will sell off"" when Coin hits the market .. Over 100% gain on RIOT Put cashed today."
2021-04-16 00:15:51,wallstreetbets,"Nice job, fuck you"

2021-04-16 02:02:27,wallstreetbets,"How much was each contract, what expiration, and how many contracts?

I realize some of this info is there but I don’t full understand calls yet"
2021-04-16 01:16:22,wallstreetbets,Sold the vast majority of it.
2021-04-16 01:12:04,wallstreetbets,Hahhahaha.  I Like that!  Will do you!  I’ll be sure to post if/when I get a 100% win.

First step is no excuses. Everyone has to their own weaknesses. Get over it. I hate folks with adhd who victimize themselves."
2021-04-16 09:30:48,wallstreetbets,"You too can do this. Step one: have $380,000 to throw at tesla call options. I'll address step two when you've got step one taken care of."
2021-04-16 01:12:52,wallstreetbets,Well if you have six figures to dump into the best performing stock on the market you should be okay
2021-04-15 23:13:45,wallstreetbets,"Farmer,  you can always buy a piece of a good stock or a good fund monthly....  the same way you’d invest in a 401k.  But regardless,  best of luck to you."
2021-04-15 23:59:37,wallstreetbets,@41g440r53 😂 sorry bro.  I’ll try harder next time.   A win is a win tho.
2021-04-16 01:11:15,wallstreetbets,Part 1 is done and part 2 is in the plans!
2021-04-16 11:28:36,wallstreetbets,Why are you in an internship for several years
2021-04-16 13:20:27,wallstreetbets,"I sold off 90+% of it.  However I do feel Tesla will do well longterm... maybe I just got lucky and rode the hypetrain up, but I do feel they will disrupt multiple industries.  The auto’s are just the start...  they could even pivot towards producing just the batteries or just the AI tech and still be successful.  

I do appreciate you being polite and respectful in your discourse tho.  If you make money in shirting Tesla,  more power to you.  I made plenty by investing in Tesla’s success and feel that I’ll continue to do so.  Best of luck to you."
2021-04-16 00:09:09,wallstreetbets,Are you talking about Cathy wood?  Who bought Coin?
2021-04-16 00:10:37,wallstreetbets,Wow well played on the riot call.  I think it will come back up soon as well.
2021-04-16 01:09:17,wallstreetbets,Well played.  I wish I timed it that well
2021-04-16 17:09:24,wallstreetbets,Do some paper trading to practice. Its a bit complicated and not for everyone.
2021-04-16 02:11:03,wallstreetbets,Jan 2023 $500 calls.  13 contracts. If you have specific questions/scenarios ask away?  I’ll help if I’m able.
2021-04-15 23:32:53,wallstreetbets,You're right man. I just need to figure out how to steer my inattention towards this. It interests me immensely but not sure of the first step.
2021-04-16 02:50:09,wallstreetbets,Motivate me dad
2021-04-16 01:05:56,wallstreetbets,Teach us your ways
2021-04-16 02:03:33,wallstreetbets,300k from options? Mind sharing which ones you made and your strat?
2021-04-15 23:14:37,wallstreetbets,Thanks bud!
2021-04-16 09:17:58,wallstreetbets,What'd you call a good stock?
2021-04-16 01:07:21,wallstreetbets,Did you realize the gains?
2021-04-16 00:52:03,wallstreetbets,Damn straight
2021-04-16 11:39:48,wallstreetbets,"Boomers gatekeeping the profession, and if I don’t stick with it I wouldn’t even be considered to be moved into the actual field. Everyone that I know does about 3-6 years of interning, because “that’s how it use to be back in the day, so it should stay like that” is what I was told."
2021-04-16 00:15:31,wallstreetbets,Y
2021-04-16 00:14:52,wallstreetbets,I bought a PUT when it was at $60 and sold it to a greater fool when it was sub $45 and looking to re-enter after that nice fat gain. No calls on a stock that was $2 and just hit $60 .. It has had a string of red days before and I think it will pause due to the options curve and then resume the move lower next week.
2021-04-16 01:27:54,wallstreetbets,Sarcasm right?
2021-04-16 17:30:22,wallstreetbets,"I understand the buy low sell high but i still need to learn more about reading volumes and all the statistics so i can understand what im doing, i see it as a challenge but im up for it"
2021-04-16 02:19:23,wallstreetbets,What wa the cost of each contract? I’m trying to see how you get the total green profit value?
2021-04-16 13:26:51,wallstreetbets,They’re going to print. Whats the breakeven?
2021-04-15 23:34:03,wallstreetbets,"I’m 27 and have been off the medication for 7 years.

Just remember they don’t want you to learn how to invest."
2021-04-16 02:04:48,wallstreetbets,"Gme, bb, nok, PLTR. Mostly shares. Some 10 baggers. Built my portfolio with spy calls and real life work."
2021-04-16 01:16:47,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-04-16 12:18:27,wallstreetbets,What industry?
2021-04-16 01:32:31,wallstreetbets,"Ooops none intended.  Sorry bro I misread the whole sentence.  I didn’t realize you meant before the split.  That sucks.  If it’s any consolation,  I missed out on 500k by trying to say trade Tesla throughout the year.  I should’ve just held into my initial investment and let it run but didn’t realize it would keep running so hard."
2021-04-16 17:37:09,wallstreetbets,Watch some YouTube videos on buying/selling options or derivatives. I personally don't do it because I always feel like I'm the chump. If I was not working full time I might get into it but not dedicating enough time and watching everything closely I probably would just screw myself over.  I just buy and hold.
2021-04-16 09:26:03,wallstreetbets,"It would appear that he spent 380k on 13 contracts meaning each one cost him about $29k. I might be reading it wrong but damn. Must have been deep itm when he bought.

Edit... They appear to all be worth $36k now, hence the profit"
2021-04-16 02:36:58,wallstreetbets,"Cost basis is listed.  One contract controls 100 shares.  Divide cost basis by total shares controlled, to get the price.   I recommend project option on YouTube to brush up on the basics."
2021-04-16 10:02:45,wallstreetbets,"I want to learn more about investing. I have a small portfolio. It’s always fascinated me. If anyone has any info, please let me know. I’m always willing to learn"

2021-04-16 01:39:41,wallstreetbets,I bought at $250 before the split. Thankfully I now have 15 shares vs my original 4 minus the one I let slip away. If only I had more cash in the first place. Could be quittin my job 🤦‍♂️
2021-04-16 14:54:14,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the accurate number crunching!  Well played.
2021-04-16 09:31:28,wallstreetbets,"Congrats on the gains.

2021-04-15 22:46:11,wallstreetbets,The easiest way to make money on PLTR the last few weeks has been wait until in dips into $22 range and buy a fuckton of $21/$22 debit spreads a week out for $ 0.50. That or buy shares on dips and sell $26c on them.
2021-04-15 21:30:45,wallstreetbets,"Next step, buy some tsla and spy puts."
2021-04-15 21:18:44,wallstreetbets,PLTR is always too volatile for options calls for me.  I just trade the stock.
2021-04-15 21:26:52,wallstreetbets,I hate PLTR with all my heart

2021-04-15 23:24:19,wallstreetbets,Damn I had the same exact thought when I was eating my dinner tonight.
2021-04-15 21:50:06,wallstreetbets,"Nah, options are dope. Will yolo again"
2021-04-16 10:55:13,wallstreetbets,Demo day was a bust if you caught the laggy livestream on YT. I thought the tech seemed pretty legit
2021-04-15 23:27:37,wallstreetbets,"Had leaps and got tired of waiting... I've got 800 JPM 149/150 spreads expiring tomorrow. If PLTR stays around $23 until I cash out, I'll probably pick up a couple hundred 4/23 or 4/30 $21/$22 spreads tomorrow afternoon. Seems like Banks hold or go up when Nasdaq dips for the most part, so I've just been going back & forth. Wait for one to dip, buy a bunch of ITM spreads, and sell when it's up and the other dips. Been working really well the last month."

2021-04-15 21:30:16,wallstreetbets,58M volume should have made the options worth something.  There’s just too many bots and hedges against it.  That’s why I’m just holding my 2.3k shares

2021-04-16 11:05:50,wallstreetbets,"Talk about a blast from the past. I’m an OG retard. In 1994, there was a company with that exact ticker symbol, MVIS. It was MediaVision. As a 19 year old college student I went broke holding about $15K in MVIS calls when they filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the Spring of 1994. Edit: https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/27/business/media-vision-bankruptcy.html"

2021-04-16 00:43:11,wallstreetbets,How do people cope losing this much money! See you at Wendy's I guess. Handies at the dumpster is on sale.
2021-04-16 02:02:34,wallstreetbets,Instead of buying calls why not just use the wheel strategy?
2021-04-16 02:21:46,wallstreetbets,I opened my fidelity account right when the SPAC thing was popular. Fidelity probably thinks I’m a retard.

2021-04-16 10:43:15,wallstreetbets,Me too. At least I sold calls in all my positions and I am seeing them all expire worthless today.
2021-04-16 10:42:33,wallstreetbets,You would of raised all our profits with the stock going up
2021-04-15 21:41:41,wallstreetbets,And I am awarding you... For balance.

2021-04-16 04:37:41,wallstreetbets,How is this outdated lol this picture looks very clean with all the info on there
2021-04-15 21:30:51,wallstreetbets,Agreed. What a garbo piece of shit.
2021-04-16 02:15:53,wallstreetbets,Let me lose my money in peace.
2021-04-16 10:48:06,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha yeah that’s why sumit sharma just negotiated a very favorable 3 year compensation package, and the members of the board are holding, buying, and exercising options, members who are deeply connected to the industry and possible acquirers. You probably bag hold GME."

2021-04-15 22:03:37,wallstreetbets,Rh was showing this as 38% down in AH. Now it's saying just 8% down for the day.
2021-04-16 07:37:45,wallstreetbets,Can’t it be mixed?
2021-04-16 06:41:21,wallstreetbets,From the logical behavior of some screens and the use ability is lacking when compared to others. Other platforms have much better analytical tools within their app. For instance when you make a chart full screen the experience is straight garbage. Compare it to trade view and come back and tell me that fidelity isn’t shit. They just could use their screen real estate much better. (I work in design and would do things much different)
2021-04-15 21:40:13,wallstreetbets,My wife for that shit for a fucking $1 about. They will most likely get bought my MSFT one day.
2021-04-16 18:20:37,wallstreetbets,your fault for buying it too high lol. its not garbage.
2021-04-15 22:26:20,wallstreetbets,"Yea, im legit curious what the buyout value is for this stonk.  Its feels like the company is still in the runway phase of its startup and its generating revenue but it is a highly speculative run.  How much could MSFT possibly offer for this company?"
2021-04-16 14:37:37,wallstreetbets,"Well, that’s not truthful

Edit: my bad bro! Sorry! Somehow I jump over to your thread from a PLTR chat."

2021-04-15 22:04:32,wallstreetbets,"Huh, I don't see that.  It was down a lot earlier, but rallied around 1:25.

It popped up to 18 on the news of MSFT's $22B Hololens 2 deal with the military, but then went back down on no news.  I don't get it. /shrug"

2021-04-16 00:23:25,wallstreetbets,they have estimates in the MVIS subreddit
2021-04-16 04:38:58,wallstreetbets,"It's 2b rn but my valuation is anywhere between 5b (realistic) to 15b (that would be insane imo)

Going off of competitors value while having the better products and being valued less etc

2021-04-15 20:23:56,wallstreetbets,"For those interested in the story:

Bought the “dip” on Feb 18 buying 100 $27 4/23 calls. 

Averaged down on the “dip” on March 8 buying another 50.

Averaged down on the “dip” on March 17 buying with my remaining portfolio. (37) 

Cried on all of the following dips.

On a real note though, I don’t even know what to do now. Seriously feel lost and depressed. 

But fuck it. Holding these bitches until expiry."

2021-04-15 20:46:24,wallstreetbets,Should of rolled out to a further date instead of averaging down on the same option which is expiring this month smh
2021-04-15 22:15:40,wallstreetbets,"Seems like just yesterday PLTR was $55 a share...

2021-04-16 04:26:54,wallstreetbets,Great. I found the guy who bought my covered calls.
2021-04-16 09:47:31,wallstreetbets,only 90% down? put in the extra effort for that last 10% it will be worth it

2021-04-16 11:24:40,wallstreetbets,This porn is making me aroused.

2021-04-16 12:47:39,wallstreetbets,Well at least you have a free stock. Hope it’s PLTR
2021-04-16 16:49:04,wallstreetbets,PLTR has been my fastest depreciating asset😓
2021-04-15 20:34:19,wallstreetbets,"Relax, this is only 2-3 months salary. You’ll make it back."
2021-04-15 23:26:09,wallstreetbets,Maybe next time 90% shares and 10% options 😅
2021-04-15 20:24:15,wallstreetbets,Oh WOW 😳 should of bought shares to play it safe
2021-04-16 03:48:40,wallstreetbets,"Imo PLTR WILL be a 100-200 dollars stock, eventually. In fact it’s one of my higher conviction plays... but for a 5-10 year period. I really don’t think PLTR will “moon” anytime soon (in fact I think it will never moon, just go up steadily over the years such as APPL or MSFT).

That’s why I have PLTR in my investment portfolio, not my trading portfolio. INVESTING =/ TRADING.

But those PLTR shares (not options lol, those don’t hold up over time) and just let it be. Investing should be very long term (10-20 years), trading is what you do short term. I wouldn’t trade with PLTR."
2021-04-16 11:23:08,wallstreetbets,get off of robinhood!

2021-04-16 04:41:05,wallstreetbets,Don't lie. You wanna murder it right about now. I do too.
2021-04-16 05:02:59,wallstreetbets,"Should've bought 2023 leaps instead, much easier to sleep at nights and give it enough time for the trade to play out."

2021-04-16 16:38:15,wallstreetbets,I'm sorry.

2021-04-16 18:48:16,wallstreetbets,Highly unpredictable. I long and it dips and when i short it goes up... Looks like Palantir somehow knows i am putting my money in..

2021-04-16 18:46:28,wallstreetbets,Lol. You’re not the only one feeling that way...
2021-04-15 20:33:26,wallstreetbets, You could always average down and buy the dip?
2021-04-16 02:52:29,wallstreetbets,Never average down on a bad short term position.  I did this exact same thing with PRPL last year and lost a similar amount of money.  Its been a roller coaster but if I can stay in this game so can you.
2021-04-15 21:26:44,wallstreetbets,GUH! Buying the dip in options is lower strikes lol. Imagine if you bought lower strikes all the way down. Demo day pop you would have come out ahead.
2021-04-15 23:42:10,wallstreetbets,"Just keep rolling over and by the time you're right hopefully it offsets all the Ls. 

Same boat as you with PLTR basically."
2021-04-15 20:35:20,wallstreetbets,Why didn’t you sell on Tuesday or Wednesday?
2021-04-15 20:24:38,wallstreetbets,thx this is better
2021-04-16 04:44:55,wallstreetbets,Just create a patron where you post your moves so people can inverse them. It's a win-win.
2021-04-15 20:34:37,wallstreetbets,"Yup, did the same."
2021-04-15 23:46:16,wallstreetbets,At any point did you think about buying shares and selling CC?  That’s what I did. I also bought 1/20/23 $27c ‘s. They are down to ~700.
2021-04-16 04:27:01,wallstreetbets,Lost 30k on spy puts friend feel better
2021-04-16 05:21:15,wallstreetbets,"Who knows what will happen, but it helps to think about stuff like follows: feb 18, pltr is $25. To get to $27, needs to go up 8% in 8-9 weeks. Annualized that’s like 50%/year. Could happen, but not a sure thing. Next time pick a reasonable growth rate forecast. Like 10% / year or something. Not advice."
2021-04-16 11:06:33,wallstreetbets,could just go buy that caninetoken and get it all back and blow it all on more PLTR calls  just to get back here again

If there would be, would you say, oh, I’m so sorry for your loss, here, take some of my gambling money to make the same mistakes over again? Horseshit. You are here because you want to make money.

Who tf in their right mind would actually exercise that call? It’s a short squeeze, GameStop could not physically be worth $800 a share even if they had a sound business plan and steady revenue coming in and year to year growth. They have none of those.

2021-04-16 10:58:42,wallstreetbets,I don’t see how now would be a good time to do it. The premiums appear to be pretty low.  I also need to educate myself much more on selling calls.

Head over to r/thetagang and learn some options strategies that actually make money for you weekly. It’s not “lottery tickets” but if you stick to a strategy you will end up on top. 

I too own PLTR calls. I bought some 6/18 37c’s on discount with the money I earned from running the wheel strategy on PLTR. I collected $72 on a weekly put I sold this week."
2021-04-16 00:25:28,wallstreetbets,Dude. Seems like a lot but it’s not. I regularly pivot between 20k losses and wins. You eventually get numb to it. Better to have some money than no money.

This is only money. Seriously. You can get out of this, but it may be a long slow trudge AAAND it may mean you get out of PLTR altogether, you two weren't meant to be.

I'd take into consideration seriously the advice you get out with some to spare. Maybe take a break and use that money for something else to build up. You all are using this as a casino, thinking you can get one hit to walk away free and happy, but need to see the dark side of the casino. There's usually no romantic ending and the house usually has the edge, especially if they got a player who's willing to bet it all."

2021-04-16 00:21:02,wallstreetbets,Did you trade a PUT for over 100% in just over a day too? That was loads of fun for me.  The hourly chart lower BB was a perfect exit point.  I don't think I've had a cleaner trade in a while. Too easy. Did the same with GME but did not hold it long enough and missed out on hundreds in profits. I think I hit RIOT perfectly today. Anyone else going to buy some puts on RIOT tomorrow? I think the pain curve is what held it up here.

I found absolutely nothing about that, but here's what I *did* find. 

Tilray, [who owns Privateer Holdings](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/irisdorbian/2019/12/17/tilray-closes-merger-with-privateer/amp/) already sells their cannabis brand ""[Marley Natural](https://www.marleynatural.com/)"" in California, Oregon, and Washington. From the website: 

>""Currently available at select locations in CA, OR, and WA in accordance with local law. "" 

Want to confirm Tilray owns the brand? Check out their December investor presentation report. https://ir.tilray.com/events-and-presentations/events 

It's all the way at the bottom, and the ""family"" of brand logos are at the top of the report. Look for the lion. 

So, Tilray currently sells weed in 3 US States, but are still allowed to be uplisted? As I said before, I'm an APHA long, so I'm **all for it**, but still...wtf? Am I missing something?

Edit: Maybe pushing it past 4/20 when memelord Schumer is expected to drop the bill he's been teasing for months."
2021-04-15 21:53:57,wallstreetbets,4/20
2021-04-15 21:47:22,wallstreetbets,I sold APHA for a gain a while back and just got into TLRY. Am I a whore?
2021-04-15 21:54:21,wallstreetbets,These cunts just don't want us to make money from this that's all
2021-04-15 20:16:51,wallstreetbets,i have lots of both and both are redder than my chick on a heavy flow day.... FML.
2021-04-15 20:27:57,wallstreetbets,"They license the right to use the brand in Canada. They don't sell or grow the brand in the US, different companies. This is pretty common in the legal market up here. American marketing is just stronger."
2021-04-16 01:24:44,wallstreetbets,"Same reason I have 200k under my mattress at any given time. 

Federally cannabis is a Schedule 1 drug. That means in the eyes of Uncle Sam it has ""No medicinal application""

This means even though my state says my grow is legal the bank doesn't want to handle it, FDIC regulations and know your customer laws.

Product can't pass state lines and out of state investors are out too. This means no major exchange is gonna touch it. What if I decide to pay dividends? Now its money laundering and they are an accessory"
2021-04-16 14:06:10,wallstreetbets,"TLRY had in their charter that a majority of shareholders had to vote (for merger to occur).

They pushed back vote to the 30th to get more time to include retail invetors, and reduced the vote from majority to 1/3.  TLRY wants this to happen!"
2021-04-16 14:13:47,wallstreetbets,I’m supposed to vote on this merger. Are we feeling yes or no?
2021-04-15 20:29:04,wallstreetbets,Something shady is going on
2021-04-16 08:57:47,wallstreetbets,"No left coast ventures owns Marley natural and was acquired by gramf. I think docklight owns the Marley CBD brand, and they *may* own the ip for all of Marley natural since privateer did create Marley and tilray does lease the ip (presumably from privateer) to sell the main Marley natural brand in Canada. 

Interesting conspiracy: one of tilrays directors is the chairman of gramf and gramf’s main cannabis products come from left coast ventures which was also founded by privateer so did privateer sell left coast so they could continue to operate without getting delisted, and once legalization happens they take back over gramf? Who knows?"
2021-04-16 19:08:08,wallstreetbets,"Hey op, reading through the comments. Can't see an adequate response.

And same question as you, did you get to the bottom of this?"

There’s import licenses that can be acquired in Canada but that doesn’t mean it will get through customs. Just a marketing ploy for now, preparing or fed legalization, which will open the flood gates of cheap Canadian weed going south...."
2021-04-16 07:47:42,wallstreetbets,I believe the tiaras merger officer went over to weed MD.  Wmd is the ticker symbol.  That might be their opening to Canada.  Wmd is super cheap too .30 a share I believe.  Not financial advice.
2021-04-15 22:45:42,wallstreetbets,I don't understand the words therefore something shady is going on
2021-04-16 11:46:08,wallstreetbets,"No they do not. 

Privateer Holdings owns Marley Naturals. Tilray owns PH. 

Link me otherwise friendo.

Also, that company is dogshit. Lol celeb brands do not do well. Ever. ""Willie's Reserve"" trash. ""Chongs Choice"" trash. Literally not a single successful celeb brand out there, and there's a reason. 

Weed isn't like headphones. You can't slap a popular face/name on it and sell billions. You might get some 1 time purchases, but if the quality isn't there then good luck getting a 2nd from anyone. Especially when it's overpriced because of the fancy face/name on or behind the package.

If people wanna spend too much money on ""designer"" weed then they just buy Cookies."
2021-04-16 14:17:41,wallstreetbets,"I was involved in a marijuana dispensary application and a whole lot of the dispensaries in my state are owned by the Canadian marijuana companies. They ""buy"" the companies through some loan and debt structure. The ""owners"" hold the license but don't have any equity and get paid a management fee. The only way I know this is someone I knew during the license process ""sold"" their license and I met the attorney who does a lot of the contracts and also has marijuana equity for the tobacco industry.

He happens to be the guy that advises on licensing structure and wrote this book. There is definitely great stock opportunities for marijuana companies but it is difficult to figure out who has what since there is all these she'll companies and no IP protection.

2021-04-16 19:39:29,wallstreetbets,"Only thing that makes sense is that all they own is the branding and are paid to use that brand, rather than paid directly from the cannabis sales. Regardless, I imagine that dynamic can change instantly considering PH is a license holder in WA state. Idk."

Move along with your FUD"
2021-04-15 22:12:22,wallstreetbets,though not before my 20 calls expire on the 30th i’m guessing
2021-04-16 07:47:54,wallstreetbets,Tilray*
2021-04-16 12:17:43,wallstreetbets,Ph most likely is an ip holding company and leasing the Marley natural licensing/production agreements to US operators. They can’t collect revenue from cannabis sales in the US while being listed on Nasdaq

2021-04-16 17:13:22,wallstreetbets,yep it seems like they just couldn't keep selling their THC edibles in the U.S. after PH was acquired by tilray so they tried to go with CBD edibles and introduce their THC edibles into Canada but as of now it basically looks abandoned.
2021-04-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"There once was a time where SPY ruled the lands, that day is upon us once again. Wsb always has been about YOLOing rent money, Student loans, credit card cash advances and life savings on super OTM short expiry options on meme stonks since its inception. 

SPY , the ETF that tracks the standard and poors 500 index funds is comfortably sitting at a point of 415 with two comfortable trading days in between now and Tuesday. SPY was on its way to meme stonk status right before the epic crash of last March which catapulted it into the meme stock elite status. The infamous 180p 4/17 or 200 5/1. Over time throughout the midpoint of 2020 the tech stonks began to take over as meme kings... until this week..... What date is tuesday? 4/20.... the ultimate meme would be 420.69. 

Spy is a mere 5 and a half points from this epic moment in history. 

Its not hard at all wsb. The ultimate meme is fully achieveable by Tuesday. 

Positions: 

SPY 420c 4/20 and varying degrees of leaps at the same strike.

Its time. I SPY with my little eye the meta meme stonk day and status.

2021-04-15 23:31:57,wallstreetbets,"You'd be surprised how little selling or buying volume moves the SPY.

1. I know you're thinking ""It's so valuable, the inertia prevents crazy movement"", but the reality is that SPY is mostly held, not traded, relative to its size (i.e. the sum of all the volume of each composite of the SPX is much higher than the volume on the SPY ETFs themselves).

That means that its a lot easier to start a trend or organize a reversal (that gets picked up by front-runner-followers) on the SPY than it is on other much more active stocks with much lower value.

2) *But wait...doesn't the SPY follow the SPX, following the valuation of the S&P500 companies?*

No. No 1:1 instant. Meaning there are large divorces between the actual component of the S&P500 vs the companies. And worse, sometimes the companies follow the SPX instead of the other way around (since the SPX is an indicator and some institutions use it as early sell signals).

&#x200B;

All of this is literal market manipulation, meaning, ""Using the known mechanism to obtain the intended effect"", not the sinister one."

2021-04-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PLUG is incredibly oversold and way under current stock valuation... And why it's going up at least 100%. PLUG is down over 60% from it's ATH. The renewable energy market was overbought and PLUG needed a pullback, similar to TSLA/NIO/FCEL/etc.

Bad News:

It got hit with an accounting error because of their auditors, KPMG. PLUG (mainly KPMG) has to reinstate it's financial results from 2018 to 2020. This caused investors to lose trust and tumble the stock into way oversold territory. Most analysts summarized the accounting issues to appear as minor but short-term worrisome, and there's limited near-term upside until resolution. This issue was 1 month ago when PLUG was trading around $48. It's nearly fallen by 50% since then.

Multiple law firms, primarily lead by ""Gross Law Firm"", also announced a class action lawsuit against PLUG. Causing it to drop ~10% more. Looking into Gross Law Firm, that's their entire business model, suing companies on behalf of shareholders on stocks that aren't performing well enough. In April alone they have opened up 9 new lawsuits against varies companies. Records show that most are settled out of court or completely dropped. In 2018 Gross Law Firm also opened a class action lawsuit against Tesla and look where TSLA is now.

Good News:

Wall Street already grossly underestimates the hydrogen energy sector. Currently Wall Street is valuing Hydrogen Energy to be roughly 1% of the world's energy. But forecasts show by 2025 it'll be between 5-12%. PLUG is the leading green energy hydrogen company. The O&G industry has reduced lobbying against Hydrogen Energy and is joining the sector: Chevron and Shell joined the Hydrogen Energy Council last year, and Exxon this year. The transition to Hydrogen Energy is starting to explode.

Last week PLUG was invited by the US department of defense to apply for a new $520 million loan guarantee. This news was still overshadowed by the accounting errors and hasn't reacted fully from it.  Upcoming news from the Biden administration will show they are ready, willing and able to provide strong support for hydrogen projects, increasing the valuating of PLUG.

Upon receiving approval from the DoE, PLUG will utilize its electrolyzer, liquefaction and distribution technologies to deploy the first resilient network of zero-carbon hydrogen production facilities across the United States. The facilities will have a combined liquid hydrogen generation capacity of approximately 180 tons per day. 

Let's review their balance sheet. PLUG also has over 1.3B of cash on hand. 1.6B in current assets and 800M in other assets. It has roughly ONLY 236M in current liabilities giving PLUG a huge advantage to invest in future energy projects mentioned above. OR settle any accounting issues, fines, or lawsuits. BABA (45x larger company) settled a $2.4B fine and the shares JUMPED 9% because investors were no longer worried, uncertainty was behind them. When PLUG reinstates it's accounting issues the stock WILL jump. Also, PLUG's 2021 financial reports have no errors and do not need to be reinstated. This is a problem in their past they need to solve.

PLUG also already has major contract supply deals with many top companies, including Amazon and Walmart, which are also current investors of PLUG. PLUG is working with Walmart to provide it with fuel cell-powered vehicles. There are plans for expansion of this deal sometime in 2021.

Looking at current analyst's price targets, 69% (ayyy) of analyst say BUY, only 1 (6%) says to SELL. The LOWEST price target for PLUG is $29, nearly $3 lower than today's close. The HIGHEST is $78, just a few dollars short of its 52-week high. Average is $57, which is 115% upside. Read this again... the lowest... price target... on PLUG... is $29. That is HIGHER than its current stock price.

For those who care about TA, even with over a 500% 1Y gain on PLUG, PLUG has just reached oversold territory based on a RSI of 30. For shorter term traders: the 4h and 1h are also hovering around 30. The Stochastic lines have crossed in every time measure, and it's entering an uptrend off the lows of today. Even if you don't believe PLUG long term, there's potential for a quick gain as this flies back to its support of $28-32 in the week or two.

TL;DR: PLUG is grossly oversold and will bounce back to around $30 in a couple weeks. Good news is being overshadowed by an accounting error and when that problem is settled, PLUG will fly. Average price target is $58, but my price target is $75 by EoY. Based on cash flow, Biden administration push for renewable energy, clean energy sector growing, and PLUG's plan for Hydrogen production facilities and vehicle research/production, PLUG can easily hit that $75 price sooner.

Positions: I've already purchased 60k in $25 and $30 strike calls expiring 1/2023. I plan to increase that by another 40k soon. If PLUG hits the average analyst price target by January of next year, I'll close my position when it crosses $500,000 value."

Hydrogen tech MAY see certain milestones in the next decades that might let it aim at the competition, but generally speaking EV's are probably the immediate future of transport and H will be remain in mostly niche markets.

If you want to speculate on sentiment and buy hoping that the price goes up by voodoo market magic then cool, but H fuel just doesn't make sense with our current technology (to me).  Regardless of what the market chooses to do with the price point the underlying technology is unlikely to break out on its own."
2021-04-15 20:16:17,wallstreetbets,massive falling knife. made me harny and so  i bought today.
2021-04-15 21:01:08,wallstreetbets,Be careful; part of the reason this dropped so much was valuation. At its ATH it was trading for more than 100x sales... so even if they grew their revenues tenfold they’d still be very expensive. The stock simply got ahead of itself on speculation and momentum. It could return to those levels with super strong revenue growth but I wouldn’t be betting on a quick return to 100x sales when the market has lost its appetite for these kinds of stocks with bond yields on the rise.

2021-04-16 00:12:11,wallstreetbets,Accounting error aka cooking the book
2021-04-16 00:22:42,wallstreetbets,"I wanted to do some math on their production to get the energy equivalence in terms of gallons of gasoline.

1kg of hydrogen is about the same energy as 1 gallon of gasoline[0]. Assuming it's metric tons, that's 360,000 gallons of gasoline equivalent produced per day. On its surface, I didn't think that number was a lot. But then I thought about the possibility of them moving into the power plant business. Those 360,000 gallons of gas turn into 13,176 MWH. For comparison, the Hoover Dam produces 11,000 MWH per day[1]. If that were to be turned into a power plant, they could provide enough energy for 450,718 households per day[2]. As a note, there are 120,756,048 households as of 2019[3].

Overall, not bad in terms of their potential output in relation to other energy sources. Of course there may be multiple plants producing the fuel, so this might not be concentrated in one place. Either way, powering nearly half a million households with renewable, green energy is a pretty good first step that should be able to scale up if they prove themselves.

None of this is financial advice, I just like looking up numbers.

2021-04-16 11:59:47,wallstreetbets,"Big 4 Auditor here. From what I've read PLUG massively fucked up in the following ways:

\- Overstated Assets

\- Failed to include losses from contracts on their financials

\- Misclassified certain costs so it would decrease R&D expense, thus boosting their revenue and profitability ratios

\- Understated impairment expense, thus boosting their revenue and profitability ratios

In my experience, when it rains it pours. Issues like these tend to be the tip of the iceberg and 99.99% of the time are driven by the executives of the company. Additionally, if you are having to fraudulently misclassify items in your Balance Sheet and Income Statement so your company's performance looks better, there are probably deeper issues going on. 

That said, maybe this is a hiccup or a genuine accident, but I wouldn't be investing my hard earned cash in them."

Look, if these companies haven’t been able to do this technology profitably for 20 years you are buying a hope and dream.   This whole market reminds me a lot of 1999.  Things that are most valued are just concepts or ‘future’ companies, and not so much current profitable companies.  SPACs, short squeeze plays, fuel cell, EV, crypto, YOLO.  Many are not profitable or barely.  Some will be huge winners in the future but many will fall to zero in the long term.  Just be careful.  Speculations are ok for a small amount that you can afford to lose if it doesnt work out.  I actually sold PLUG in 2000 and made some, thank goodness I never went back in."
2021-04-16 02:42:53,wallstreetbets,"Big issue of hydrogen is that it requires so many different innovations and new infrastructure at once.

BEV won because apart of better lithium ion batteries every single technology and infrastructure was almost already there:
- Transport of electricity? Check. Any place in developed areas is not further than a few hundred meters from the next power line.
- Electricity generation? Check. We have power plants. Do we have hydrogen plants? No.
- Charging? Is only the second technology next to batteries that required innovation and infrastructure. Solved by plug standardization and the breakthrough by Tesla with their network.

Hydrogen requires:
- How to transport hydrogen? If you tried using gas pipelines, they would requires further insulation. H2 is literally the smallest molecule possible, so escapes easily.
- Where and how to refuel hydrogen? 
- Hydrogen plants? Need capital and the will to build them.

The only way forward for hydrogen is a push by government agencies. The private industry will not have the incentives to make it work apart of Big Oil."

We strongly reject the unfounded allegations made against us and are defending against this meritless action. We fully intend to continue serving our Massachusetts customers.

To be clear: today’s news has no impact on your account.

You can learn more about what’s going in our blog post and get the facts in our Help Center.

Does this impact the money in my account? 
No, this decision by Massachusetts does not impact your funds. 

Is Robinhood going away for Massachusetts customers? 
We love Massachusetts and our Massachusetts customers, and we fully intend to continue serving you for the long term. We welcome the opportunity to correct the record on both the facts and the law, and expect to prevail in state court.

If I’m currently a Massachusetts resident, can I still trade? 
Yes. You still have access to your Robinhood account as usual. The pending litigation does not have any impact on your account.

Does this impact customers in any other states?
No. There is also no impact for customers who are not residents of Massachusetts.

My guess is that they'll force RH to add restrictions as part of a settlement.

In any event, RH needs a better compliance and PR /corporate communciations team.

2021-04-16 14:54:28,wallstreetbets,Definitely filing a lawsuit against you scumbags
2021-04-16 15:01:55,wallstreetbets,Lol RH thinks they have right to sue anyone ? Upside down world.
2021-04-16 15:34:25,wallstreetbets,So what would it mean if you have a robinhood account and they get shut down? Do you just lose everything in the account?
2021-04-16 15:54:48,wallstreetbets,"Good.  

Fuck those assholes."
2021-04-16 15:56:25,wallstreetbets,Now what am I going to use to look at graphs
2021-04-16 16:57:25,wallstreetbets,Holly molly
2021-04-16 19:05:29,wallstreetbets,I'm still not really sure about the long run potential of suits like this.  Free market!!
2021-04-15 20:02:23,wallstreetbets,lol - yeah it's a fucking scam
2021-04-15 20:02:58,wallstreetbets,Good fuck em.
2021-04-16 08:01:21,wallstreetbets,"I know it’s not popular opinion, but I like robinhood"
2021-04-16 02:43:27,wallstreetbets,"On one hand, i want robinhood to get fucked. on the other hand, they think people are stupid and want to control everything.....

what do lmao"
2021-04-16 03:14:59,wallstreetbets,"Weren’t a lot of major brokerages doing the same thing? I hope that robinhood isn’t the only brokerage that gets scrutinized because it’s less established, when all the big players did similar stuff"
2021-04-16 12:02:23,wallstreetbets,Why are people STILL using Robinhood??? Stop feeding these fuckers and stop using them!
2021-04-16 12:05:21,wallstreetbets,Transferring money is a joke in this app. Vlad gives Bulgaria a bad rap.
2021-04-15 20:09:03,wallstreetbets,"When I was a kehd back in fackin bulgaria, shit was wicked hahd."
2021-04-15 20:25:47,wallstreetbets,That’s what I say when I get in trouble at work or pulled over or done and dash and get caught: “when I was a boy in Bulgaria”
2021-04-15 22:16:17,wallstreetbets,That’s a great question. Let me start from the beginning.
2021-04-15 20:04:41,wallstreetbets,Yes or no
2021-04-15 20:59:18,wallstreetbets,Yes or no
2021-04-15 20:34:46,wallstreetbets,Yes or no?
2021-04-16 00:49:18,wallstreetbets,I'm glad you asked the question thank you for asking. Let me preface it with some historical context so that I can ramble on about nothing related to the question so as to waste every one's time.
2021-04-16 01:15:18,wallstreetbets,"Bulgaria, the Brockton of Europe."
2021-04-16 01:30:03,wallstreetbets,"You know, that reminds me of my childhood in Bulgaria....."
2021-04-16 01:48:41,wallstreetbets,Thank you Congress woman for that fantastic statement...
2021-04-16 02:33:27,wallstreetbets,After One Coin....
2021-04-16 03:03:33,wallstreetbets,"No, it's not; in fact, I'ma do it right now:

As a Bulgarian, I dearly hope they lose their license."
2021-04-16 08:33:47,wallstreetbets,***THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER THAT WONDERFUL QUESTION THAT YOUVE JUST ASKED WITH SUCH VIGOR AND STRENGTH AS A YOUNG BOY GROWING UP IN BULGARIA MY FATHER ONLY OWNED 17 BROTHELS SO OBVIOUSLY OUR FAMILY STRUGGLED MIGHTILY***
2021-04-15 23:16:34,wallstreetbets,"Did anyone ring the one year bell? Nope your good to go, I didnt hear no bell."
2021-04-15 23:49:38,wallstreetbets,Yes or no?
2021-04-16 00:40:13,wallstreetbets,Your username O_o
2021-04-16 00:55:33,wallstreetbets,My brain is full of oatmeal and strange but appropriate references. [https://youtu.be/\_ZdA9m8XvJk?t=222](https://youtu.be/_ZdA9m8XvJk?t=222)
2021-04-16 03:49:52,wallstreetbets,Great question I’m glad you asked that wonderful question which I am going to answer right at this very moment for you and I hope my answer will satisfy your desire to understand more about this issue and oh no looks like I’m out of time to answer your wonderful question so sorry I couldn’t answer this great question.
2021-04-16 08:37:32,wallstreetbets,Yes or no
2021-04-16 09:48:55,wallstreetbets,I remember when I was a small kid in Bulgaria...I tap 5 mana and play reverse trap. I draw two from the deck and return all the money to my hand. I end my turn.
2021-04-16 17:04:50,wallstreetbets,YES OR NO
2021-04-15 21:11:18,wallstreetbets,"You’ll never see them in the same room, let me tell ya..."
2021-04-16 00:00:17,wallstreetbets,"Yup, he hails from beautiful and safe Brockton MA. It was in their public high school computer lab where he first learned enterprise valuation and DCF modeling, all standard curriculum in the Brockton public school system."
2021-04-16 00:43:46,wallstreetbets,I thought he was from the moon and trying to get back.
2021-04-15 23:07:52,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-16 01:51:34,wallstreetbets,He is and rightfully isn’t using fucking trash Robinhood
2021-04-15 22:49:21,wallstreetbets,Hes from Broke town
2021-04-16 03:50:44,wallstreetbets,Brockton. He used to be a track star back in the day. Graduated 4 years before me and pretty sure he held some records.
2021-04-16 00:21:54,wallstreetbets,Hes got enough money to live in any state in the country. If I were him I would relocate
2021-04-15 21:47:39,wallstreetbets,So is Elizabeth Warren
2021-04-16 01:50:17,wallstreetbets,Yup. Been to his house. Nice guy.
2021-04-16 05:19:06,wallstreetbets,Hes from Boston so yes
2021-04-16 07:05:50,wallstreetbets,Slab City CA
2021-04-16 07:16:58,wallstreetbets,He uses E*TRADE.
2021-04-16 09:38:40,wallstreetbets,~~Somerset?~~ ~~Wilmington~~ Brockton?
2021-04-16 12:34:29,wallstreetbets,Originally yes. But I’ve heard he’s about to change his legal address to the moon😎🌕🚀
2021-04-16 14:10:33,wallstreetbets,"All this talk about Brockton. If you haven't yet, go watch Wayne."
2021-04-15 20:39:09,wallstreetbets,"I’m from Massachusetts, the state literally sucks at everything. Investing, no matter how much or how little, is a fucking risk. I don’t need my shitty state poking its even shittier head into my fucking business. I know the risk, make like a tree and fuck off."
2021-04-16 12:52:31,wallstreetbets,"Yea while fuck robinhood. We should be backing robinhood in this one. Mass has been trying to limit retail investing for the past year. Limiting the amount of brokerage fee free trades with the goal of ""protecting the little guys"". Its all BS"
2021-04-16 04:17:01,wallstreetbets,"When listening to the hearing, very clear the there’s a big group of democrats trying to close the market or reduce their access to the stock market."
2021-04-16 01:00:37,wallstreetbets,"I guess they could go after RH for having too much control of its users? Like RH shouldn’t be able to have a general brokerage license when they can - and obviously do - limit certain assets to certain classes of customers.

If RH wants to be a brokerage then they must broker trades. Not just trades that they make money on. 

And they ESPECIALLY can’t lie to the world about what’s going on behind the scenes."
2021-04-16 03:09:56,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood makes it seem investing is fun with confetti, and this confetti makes people lose money so they need to be sued."
2021-04-16 16:25:54,wallstreetbets,"Yea, it's sad to see everyone hop on the whole ""yea, take THAT"" bandwagon against Robinhood. Once you turn 15 you realize the world isn't black and white. Robinhood should be held accountable for what they did to retail traders, but we shouldn't be onboard for punishing them just because they allow us to control our finances."
2021-04-15 22:11:46,wallstreetbets,Elizabeth Warren
2021-04-16 10:18:38,wallstreetbets,Some could say not providing healthcare to your citizens is also risky
2021-04-15 21:47:24,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah I’m from Minnesota and I immediately wrote my representative when I heard they were targeting all discount brokerages. I received a canned email about “unity” and “seeing past the headlines”. Well Tom Emmer, if you’re out there, you can suck my dick. I can get behind that union."
2021-04-15 23:24:32,wallstreetbets,You must not be from MA. The state is worried people will plow their extra cash into stocks rather than the Mass Lotto.
2021-04-16 00:47:01,wallstreetbets,And yet gacha games are making billions off of selling kids in game tokens and loot boxes.
2021-04-15 21:04:50,wallstreetbets,I really miss those.
2021-04-15 21:21:56,wallstreetbets,But I thought they like it when the poors stay poors? If we're too dumb we're just locking in the poorness.
2021-04-16 00:06:24,wallstreetbets,"I'll bite. That's not at all what the state said.

They said that Robinhood was specifically targeting unsophisticated investors. When you get into securities laws, the difference between sophisticated and unsophisticated actually means something, as opposed to just ""stupid.""

Also they claimed the platform isn't properly accounting for shares...Which is something you think you'd want them to do....I use Robinhood and I don't want them to not account for my shit."
2021-04-15 22:06:46,wallstreetbets,But they are perfectly fine opening a new casino. 🙄🙄
2021-04-15 20:09:36,wallstreetbets,"Users have already committed suicide after seeing monsterous negative numbers when options they sold are exercised (even if they made money on their trade overall).

Not to mention the absolute shit show that is quality control at RH with the outages during heavy load and two fucking bugs that allowed users to get _infinite fucking leverage_.

Whether or not users are too stupid for trading is another discussion but considering the shoddy product and the risk they put to their users I hope Robinhood gets absolutely fucked."
2021-04-16 00:01:10,wallstreetbets,"I'm from MA, and it's more like after the whole GME halt debacle where they artificially limited orders because their business model is literally skimming the top of every transaction in an attempt to deceive people into believing they are even retail traders when in reality they are just pooling orders and closing at a later date at inflated prices. Robinhood uses deceitful tactics and makes irresponsible decisions to keep their friends citadel in the green using your money. 

Any one with a brain should use a real broker and anyone using Robinhood is just asking to be cheated and lied to. MA knows this because we're ahead of the curve."
2021-04-16 01:13:38,wallstreetbets,"The cannons are nice though. 

I’m fairly certain it’s not confetti, but a mixture of endorphins, dopamine, and regrettable decisions."
2021-04-16 02:19:46,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think that’s it. The idea that they’re protecting retail investors conveniently misdirects from the fact that it benefits a certain segment of the population to put in regulations such as “accredited investor” and “pattern day trader”. 


The rules are there to protect the dominance of the top traders, funds and banks- not to protect retail investors. They have massive influence over legislation and have used it to benefit their personal interests for decades."
2021-04-15 23:45:47,wallstreetbets,"I'm so sick and tired of all this bitching about Robinhood, I don't recommend them as a brokerage but they didn't do anything worse than any of the other brokerages that shut down trading. It was either that or go bankrupt and screw over literally all of their customers. Which would people prefer?

It's still fucked, but it's the truth."
2021-04-16 01:02:36,wallstreetbets,"Uh, rates of education in Massachusetts are probably close to the highest in the world... I'm not sure that's what's going through legislator's minds. Among the world's best schools at every level are in Massachusetts- private schools, universities, public schools, even infant toddler development programs. I guess I don't really believe that's the measure of intelligence, or that anything is that simple, but Massachusetts doesn't seem uncommonly stupid."
2021-04-16 00:06:24,wallstreetbets,fuck massechutses as a state tbh
2021-04-15 21:35:49,wallstreetbets,Can confirm I’m from mass and I own a confetti cannon
2021-04-15 23:08:03,wallstreetbets,lol.
2021-04-16 01:05:18,wallstreetbets,Are they wrong tho?
2021-04-16 01:19:01,wallstreetbets,"MA resident here, we have some of the best colleges and hospitals in the country, including but not limited to Harvard, MIT, MGH, and many more, yet when it comes to investing? Forget it, I guess we’re better off arguing for them to fix potholes, smh."
2021-04-16 01:45:09,wallstreetbets,There are 9.8 million people here that make me believe they are not necessarily wrong
2021-04-16 01:47:52,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately, they're not wrong."
2021-04-16 01:58:13,wallstreetbets,That’s actually a fucking excellent summary.
2021-04-16 02:51:55,wallstreetbets,"Yep.  I know this place has bias against RH and it is rightfully deserved, but MASS politicians are NOT your friends.   The end goal is to eliminate competition and allow all the large banks to go back to charging obscene trading fees.  Anyone else remember getting charged $30/trade and how crazy it was that e-trade only charged $15?   Yeah...   that’s what these politicians want back.  They’re not in the least bit concerned about you or what RH did.  They want you to stop trading on your own and let “smarter” people handle the money for you.  You know, like the smart people that work at hedge funds..."
2021-04-16 02:55:00,wallstreetbets,"I can't access the complaint. Doesn't it go into their shady accounting practices?

If that is the case, then they should be held up. Lightweight brokerage should not mean the ability to dodge rules.

As for easy access to derivatives, should there be? Normally we try to make it difficult for people to mess with high voltages, shouldn't we have a few small things to ensure that people who mess with derivs know what they are getting into?"
2021-04-16 03:16:15,wallstreetbets,isn't that accurate tho
2021-04-16 05:14:49,wallstreetbets,You don’t ‘Invest’ at a casino.
2021-04-16 07:08:04,wallstreetbets,"Ignoring the failures of RH to follow legal requirements?

>
Massachusetts regulators said Robinhood has failed to report its fractional share trade executions for over a year, ""demonstrating its inability to follow the most basic requirements"" required of broker-dealers"
2021-04-16 07:25:53,wallstreetbets,But gambling at our new casinos is perfectly fine! MA just wants to squeeze more money out of robinhood they don’t give a flying fuck about the best interest of its citizens
2021-04-16 01:15:51,wallstreetbets,I hate Robinhood because they fucked me in January by manipulating the market but Massachusetts has no legal argument.  The reporting requirements is a fine at best.
2021-04-15 20:25:42,wallstreetbets,"Yea, MA cares!!  They care about their revenue and don’t like anyone stealing ‘their’ citizens money!!! MA wants that cash as it is a cesspool of corruption!"
2021-04-15 20:22:41,wallstreetbets,I think if they want to protect from “predatory practices” they should look into hedge funds parasitically shorting companies into ruin and using them filing bankruptcy as a protection from paying taxes
2021-04-15 20:27:43,wallstreetbets,Poor needs to stay poor. Can't be making 1000%s in a hour
2021-04-15 22:26:12,wallstreetbets,"Casino doesn't change its rules mid game. It's like playing blackjack, getting two aces and not being allowed to split because the casino's losing money."
2021-04-15 23:34:56,wallstreetbets,because at a casino you know what you're getting yourself into - all the information is clear. RH is conning people and acting in bad faith
2021-04-15 22:10:49,wallstreetbets,Elizabeth Warren
2021-04-15 23:13:04,wallstreetbets,"In a casino you're limited to losing only what you're betting. In the stock market you can use margin to sell call options, so you can bet $200 and end up with thousands in debt."
2021-04-15 23:13:40,wallstreetbets,Not allowing buying but allowing selling is not enough for you? Should trading platforms have that freedom? RH should be closed down a month ago
2021-04-15 23:18:23,wallstreetbets,"Fuck robinhood, not the time to be PC. They're fraudulent operation."
2021-04-15 23:25:02,wallstreetbets,"The casino doesn’t pretend they’re a legitimate broker following regulations. They’re a fucking casino, you know what you’re getting. And casinos are HEAVILY regulated for fairness."
2021-04-15 23:26:49,wallstreetbets,The stock market is a casino.
2021-04-16 00:08:39,wallstreetbets,because with a casino you can't make money :)
2021-04-16 00:10:03,wallstreetbets,People are going to gamble whether or not there are state sanctioned/sponsored casinos. The state being involved actually makes it more fair than it would be otherwise.
2021-04-16 01:10:53,wallstreetbets,Because the casinos are a tax disguised as entertainment.
2021-04-16 02:05:25,wallstreetbets,Yeah but I bet MA gets taxes from the casino...
2021-04-16 06:32:29,wallstreetbets,"Let me explain: See, the Democrat Party is the Mafia. Casinos know this and cut them in for their piece of the pie. Tribute, if you will.

Robinhood isn't cutting the Dems in on the action.

The State of Massachusetts is a protection racket."
2021-04-16 15:01:08,wallstreetbets,Because they don't want you going to *another* casino
2021-04-16 17:06:13,wallstreetbets,Because the state doesn't make any money when you lose it on Robinhood.
2021-04-15 23:50:14,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood deserves to be shut down for many reasons, not this one"
2021-04-15 22:52:17,wallstreetbets,"By the way it's worded, yes in part anyway."
2021-04-16 06:16:06,wallstreetbets,very much so
2021-04-16 13:45:43,wallstreetbets,Yes absolutely. They might be after robinhood here but do not celebrate or side with this human garbage. They wanted to 30/90 day freeze GME on squeeze day 2 and they want to take options away from small accounts completely.
2021-04-16 11:21:30,wallstreetbets,Absolutely!
2021-04-15 22:21:17,wallstreetbets,Bill Galvin is a punk bitch that thinks we are still in 1985 his heyday
2021-04-15 23:44:31,wallstreetbets,"Gavin routinely inserts himself into PSAs that air in prime time her on local MA tv stations whenever he is in an election year.  Huge ethics violation, but business as usual for him.  Complete political hack."
2021-04-16 00:48:12,wallstreetbets,"Yes, William Galvin, aka the sophisticated investor needs to learn some fundamentals!"
2021-04-15 20:08:53,wallstreetbets,Who was running that hearing?
2021-04-16 00:49:11,wallstreetbets,fuck massachusetts or TAXachusetts as my pops used to say
2021-04-16 04:07:45,wallstreetbets,Blame the state too bad people keep voting liberal ideas
2021-04-16 06:38:56,wallstreetbets,Damn I really Mr Wonderful!
2021-04-16 02:33:21,wallstreetbets,I know this is unpopular opinion among the big boys here but if it wasn’t for RH millions of people wouldn’t even know where to start. At my work half the time is spent trading the last year or so and many of us are future millionaires
2021-04-16 06:42:18,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I don’t like the RH CEO either, but this is BS.  They absolutely screwed up Fractional share reporting.  I am not aware of any major brokerage who hasn’t screwed up reporting somewhere.  None of them has ever been even threatened with something like this.  Not remotely.  

Hell, Wells Fargo constantly ass raped their traditional banking customers for years.  Blatantly violating a host of banking and consumer protection laws and even fraud laws for tens of thousands of clients.

They paid huge fines and moved on.  Mass never suspended any of their licenses."
2021-04-16 02:26:16,wallstreetbets,"They shouldn't lose the license.

People had common justice and they made a reputation, if some people want to keep using it then let them eat cake."
2021-04-16 01:55:47,wallstreetbets,"I’d pay 10$ per trade, it’s actually a super low price unless you are moving 80 bucks which is 99% of the time pointless."
2021-04-16 16:25:20,wallstreetbets,"I have come to accept that, though RH was weak, regulators never looked at the actual culprit: the clearinghouses."
2021-04-16 02:28:35,wallstreetbets,Still paying 7.35 round trip on a futures contract. It’s traded directly on the CME. The CME has never fucked me over the way Robinhood has.
2021-04-16 01:49:32,wallstreetbets,Lol imagine thinking we had an open market to begin with
2021-04-16 13:48:17,wallstreetbets,Amen do not forget these massachusetts fuckwads wanted to 30 day restrict gme on day two.
2021-04-16 12:22:35,wallstreetbets,They're not buying our gambling WAAAAAAAAAAAAH
2021-04-16 07:11:26,wallstreetbets,I can’t buy lottery tickets on credit...I disagree with MA doing this and I live here but all the lottery and casino analogies are apples to oranges.
2021-04-15 23:44:01,wallstreetbets,Don't fall into a slippery slope fallacy too easily. There's a big difference between taking away robin hood's brokerage license for malpractice and restricting trade for buyers. Disclaimer I don't like Robinhood and if they pull more shit like the gamestop fiasco maybe they shouldn't be a broker at all.
2021-04-16 00:40:20,wallstreetbets,">The justifications being used to take away Robinhood’s brokerage license is the same justification that will be used to restrict the freedom most of you have to trade, that you are too incompetent to make decisions yourself.

Unfortunately this is America. The same paragraph is used to shut down any other type of change. So don't worry, it wont happen."
2021-04-15 23:59:55,wallstreetbets,The apes are gonna ruin the market for us before this is all over. I fucking guarantee it.
2021-04-16 13:47:37,wallstreetbets,Amen do not forget these massachusetts fuckwads wanted to 30 day restrict gme on day two.
2021-04-16 01:57:20,wallstreetbets,One doesn’t go with the other. It is possible that someone eventually try to pull that but Robinhood license should be removed.
2021-04-16 01:45:27,wallstreetbets,hey now! we'll have none of your common sense and wisdom in this discussion!
2021-04-16 13:48:03,wallstreetbets,Amen do not forget these massachusetts fuckwads wanted to 30 day restrict gme on day two. They want to take away options from small accounts completely as well.
2021-04-16 06:01:56,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I get pissed that people only blame Robonhood for the January fiasco. There were several brokerages doing it, and they all did it at the exact same time that day, after trading had began. There is no way Robinhood was acting on their own when they did that. It was coordinated and intentional. I'm still pissed about it. I had a sell order set that day to get back my initial profits set not far above open and got fucked. The fact that they are still in business after that infuriates me. It was blatant market manipulation. If it was really about liquidity or ""protecting retail"" from the volatility, they would have given their users at the very least 24hour warning. But nope, they just all turned the buy button off out of the blue and tanked it. They should all be facing charges."

2021-04-16 06:40:38,wallstreetbets,It's because the lottery doesn't give a confetti icon when you win
2021-04-15 20:41:37,wallstreetbets,"It's the perfect opportunity for them.  Everyone hates RH for restricting trading (a valid reason to go after the company), but they're going after them for making it easier for people mess with the market.  They'll fuck you out of your freedom to invest, set a dangerous precedent, and come out looking like the heros that took down robinhood.  You're blind if you can't see that.

Fuck Robinhood, but for the right reasons.  This a free country.  If you lose money in the market it sucks, but that's on you and least you had the freedom to make that decision."
2021-04-15 20:49:55,wallstreetbets,Honestly I get people are mad that rh blocked buys NOT SELLS !!!!!! But so Did 30 OTHER BROKERS!!!!! If it wasn’t for Robinhood we’d arguably struggle to be able to own the majority of the float to begin with
2021-04-15 22:45:44,wallstreetbets,Oh thank god. I thought I was having deja vu. I remember reading these exact comments and could hear the twilight zone theme playing
2021-04-16 03:26:12,wallstreetbets,Why isn’t this at the top
2021-04-16 00:11:50,wallstreetbets,I’ve done really well with robinhood. Life changing well. Just buying and holding blue chips and etfs the past 6 years. Just have to be careful with how they fill your orders.
2021-04-16 00:10:46,wallstreetbets,"Other brokerages do also, RH is just the most accessible. But yeah that’s probably a driver is too many “common folk” are getting access."
2021-04-16 07:43:48,wallstreetbets,It’s not hard to trade. Robinhood is a garbage platform that shouldn’t be allowed to exist. There’s tons of other and better platforms
2021-04-16 13:50:24,wallstreetbets,Amen do not forget these massachusetts fuckwads wanted to 30 day restrict gme on day two.
2021-04-15 23:47:29,wallstreetbets,Wendy’s
2021-04-16 00:42:26,wallstreetbets,Peep William Galvin. He doesn’t get it.
2021-04-16 00:45:46,wallstreetbets,Let’s roast William Galvin aka the sophisticated investor.
2021-04-16 12:27:26,wallstreetbets,"> I worked for a time for some of that Old Money.

I wonder if your boss' MB&F watches are ticking a little faster as if they feel a disturbance in the force, like someone TALKING SOME SHIT lmao"
2021-04-16 02:23:21,wallstreetbets,"RH does not own shares, the DTCC does. However, indirectly they are held as RH but as their customer accounts. It he issue is with fractional shares. If we both own 0.5 shares, the DTCC does not know about it directly as one share will be under the name of RH and then split using their accounts, so RH knows which bit is your and which is mine. Unfortunately one of the complaints by MA is that this is not very transparent in RH's books."
2021-04-16 15:54:59,wallstreetbets,"This is pretty much why everyone has been jumping to new brokerages, because nobody knows exactly what will happen but it sure as hell won’t be good for the retail investor"
2021-04-15 23:06:06,wallstreetbets,I can't wait to get the fuck out of this hellhole.
2021-04-15 23:00:20,wallstreetbets,Dude I'm fucking moving to Florida. This place is really starting to fucking blow
2021-04-16 00:09:54,wallstreetbets,fuck ma and their retarded gun laws
2021-04-15 20:59:02,wallstreetbets,"I’m still 💎 🙌ing shares on RH because I didn’t want to risk tying them up when I switched to a new broker for the rest of my investments. If RH is taken down, other brokers we use might restrict retail trader access to their platforms simply to prevent any legal issues of their own. Unfortunately this is not the news we want, they are not looking at RH corruption, so to speak, they are basically calling us irresponsible and unable to handle trading, and accusing RH of taking advantage. Ideally MA is overreaching and the changes, if any, will be to RH’s ABYSMAL customer service, and sanctions accordingly rather than revoking their license (at least until this thing squeezes, then they can ban RH forever, whatever, it’ll be raining tendies and I’ll no longer be retail, I’ll be 🐳).

ETA: emojis and stuff i forgot to say"
2021-04-15 21:09:05,wallstreetbets,At the same time wouldn't all the open brokerages set a precedent that retail trading IS allowed?  It may have more to do with risk profiles than retail trading being allowed.
2021-04-15 20:27:19,wallstreetbets,"I meant I am down in several stocks Aphria especially I’m down 2k what will
Happen of
They revoke for mass"
2021-04-15 23:40:30,wallstreetbets,"You realize the precedent this would set, right? It would be horrible for all retail traders, not just Robinhood. This is a state government saying you’re too dumb to invest in “risky trading” but you can go down the street and blow your life savings at the casino."
2021-04-15 20:19:43,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, not really, Vlad. There are plenty of alternatives. 

""Apparently Mass believes it's residents are too stupid to invest. Here at Robinhood, we believe they're too stupid to transfer an account!"""
2021-04-15 21:11:52,wallstreetbets,"I mean, the result would mean more restrictions on individual investors too..."
2021-04-16 05:53:33,wallstreetbets,They deserve each other
2021-04-16 07:33:15,wallstreetbets,Massachusetts is condescending AF.
2021-04-16 07:32:31,wallstreetbets,Is that a real question or are you being sarcastic?
2021-04-16 10:28:32,wallstreetbets,Yeah because we all know how ethical and aboveboard Bezos and Cook are.
2021-04-16 08:52:47,wallstreetbets,Very unpopular give they literally stole money from a lot of your counterparts on here.
2021-04-15 20:36:34,wallstreetbets,"Depends! Do you believe Robinhood single handedly stopped a short squeeze? If you answer yes, you want Vanguard. If you don't think that Robinhood single handedly prevented a short squeeze, then literally any brokerage is fine. I personally prefer TDAmeritrade.    

Personally I use both RH and TDA."

2021-04-16 08:23:45,wallstreetbets,At least they got good weed
2021-04-16 08:46:11,wallstreetbets,"Oh? Did you know that when you buy stock on Robinhood, you actually get an IOU for the stock and they only give you the difference in price when you sell. This prevents the stock price from rising because nobody actually bought the stock yet. To make matters worse, they then sell your investment activity info so that hedge funds can bet against you. Unethical bullshit like that is why we need government regulations."
2021-04-16 12:22:03,wallstreetbets,Compared to fuckin where?
2021-04-16 15:34:42,wallstreetbets,this comment makes me happy
2021-04-16 17:07:16,wallstreetbets,Yeah this isn’t even robinhoods fuck up surprisingly. The state saw an opportunity at someone who is small and fragile. They fucking sue everybody they think they can get money from to save their own skin.

2021-04-16 01:42:43,wallstreetbets,look at its leadership...MA is literally on the wrong side of everything since 1789.
2021-04-16 04:10:48,wallstreetbets,I’m pretty sure there is a state lottery in Massachusetts so i don’t know what they’re complaining about...

2021-04-16 01:46:49,wallstreetbets,"I’m also from MA and I’m okay with this. I’m sorry but there *should* be a kind of license or exam required to trade options. You don’t give a toddler a loaded gun, most regular investors don’t know what the end of an option is going to blow their faces off."
2021-04-16 07:12:38,wallstreetbets,They suck at building roads
2021-04-16 11:48:54,wallstreetbets,"Yup, Elizabeth Warren made it her mission to make sure this never happens again which is sooo surprising seeing as how she campaigned ""for the people"""
2021-04-16 12:56:58,wallstreetbets,MA is one of the best run states in the country and they're clearly fighting for the little guy here by burning Robinhood at the stake.  you should be proud to be from MA.
2021-04-16 18:01:16,wallstreetbets,"Seriously though, just moved to Boston from NY and holy shit MA has a fixed 12% short term capital gains tax - no mater your income. What can I do about this(as an options trader) and how can I have my voice heard about my disapproval of MA bullying RH?"
2021-04-16 19:24:13,wallstreetbets,It’s make like a tree and leave.
2021-04-16 07:56:36,wallstreetbets,"Hey since you're from there maybe you can answer this:

How come everyone drives 85 mph on the highways--even the minor ones?  OK don't me wrong, that is fine on it's own, but is it some kind of felony in the state where you can't leave any more than 1 foot of space between you in the car in front?  

It's like a fun game of ""red light green light"" but everyone on the highway needs to slam on their brakes at the same time.  If you mess up you die!"

2021-04-16 19:08:58,wallstreetbets,And Bill Galvin was absolutely one of them
2021-04-16 07:20:04,wallstreetbets,"Except the lawsuit is about exactly the opposite.

They are trying to block Robinhood because it gives customers too much ability to do risky things and choose risky stock or options strategies, and of course confetti.

No matter what you think about Robinhood this lawsuit it BS.  It’s intent is to signal that people should only be able to invest via traditional brokers 1980s style.  They want large fees on trades so only wealthy people can do it.

The real long term goal here is to get people like you and me out of the market, to make trades for you and me so expensive that we only buy stocks in batches of $10,000 and hold forever."
2021-04-15 20:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that’s what I came to this sub for. Learning how to connect Confetti cannons to my stocks that only spam green and red every 5% shift

2021-04-16 01:12:23,wallstreetbets,"When it comes to contacting your representative/senator, calling is so much better.

There's a lot of automated ""contact your representative"" apps, making email easily ignorable for most in offices because 99% of their inbox is the same canned draft about some shit on the news (sometimes not even relevant in their district). So they let loose an automatic reply and if you're lucky a teams of summer interns get a crack at the inbox for an hour a day, And they probably browse social media instead of scouring the box.

Call in. 20 of your buddies calling in the same week willing to leave their name and address and talk to a staffer for 15 minutes will have more impact than a thousand emails. Occasionally one of you will get the actual representative when they're around the office."
2021-04-15 22:36:18,wallstreetbets,Best state and fuck Emmer.

2021-04-16 02:41:01,wallstreetbets,"“Sophisticated investors, according to part of the SEC's definition, have enough knowledge and experience in business matters to evaluate the risks and merits of an investment” taken from Marketwatch. 

How can one get knowledge without actually doing said thing? Imo what RH does is great. They do talk up their Robinhood Learn stuff a lot. I’ve checked it out and it’s not bad. Some of the options strategies may be difficult for people but that just comes with the territory. It is correct information. So they are trying to educate people on how things work in easy to understand formats. Classroom lectures in college (which I’m in now) can and are way more difficult to understand compared to the Robinhood learn. I personally support them teaching the commoners to become “sophisticated” as per the definition. 

In regards to the way they handle securities, I do not work for them so I have no idea how they handle them. I can hope they handle everything legally. 

Overall, I believe RH is good for the people. It helps people get started and start learning. The amount of people I meet irl that don’t know much of anything about finance or just even saving money in general is mind boggling."

2021-04-16 00:00:02,wallstreetbets,"That ""infinite"" leverage thing is pretty common though, I did that with 100x leveraged DAX CFDs when I had opened up my first trading account ages ago, did the thing the ""can not go tits up, it is free money"" guy did without even realizing that I had retarded amounts of money on the table and just 100€ in my account.

Was able to get out of the situation without bankrupting my country though. Was a total ""lesson learned"" moment, was shaking in fear when  it finally hit me what I just did.

This is still possible with a lot of CFD brokers I guess."
2021-04-15 22:40:11,wallstreetbets,Lol I’ve never felt at risk for milking myself because of Robinhood. That’s a lot of blame to place on a casino.

2021-04-16 00:33:50,wallstreetbets,"Well actually they didn't shut down trading, only buying. And only for retail investors. Which is very illegal market manipulation. 

Fidelity did not do this."

2021-04-16 01:01:35,wallstreetbets,"Actually you’re probably onto something there. More people gambling in the stock market means fewer people gambling in casinos, which likely bring in a ton of money to the state. That’s so fucked up. What a shit show"
2021-04-16 05:00:08,wallstreetbets,Dont forget a cesspool of entitled stuck up people with rich white towns that literally (no exaggeration) have laws to make sure poor people aren't hanging around in their area. I wish I was kidding.

That is no ones fault but your own.  This is a slippery slope and I don’t like it."
2021-04-16 06:51:44,wallstreetbets,This is just not true.  Unless you turn on Robinhood Gold margin and use their $5000 you cannot lose more than you put in.

2021-04-16 07:35:39,wallstreetbets,Sir this IS a casino.
2021-04-16 06:57:47,wallstreetbets,"Right?  Casinos are DESIGNED for you to lose money and those are apparently fine in Massachusetts now.

You could argue that Robinhood is designed to get you to put more money in but that is literally what every business ever is designed to do."

But you can still compare them."
2021-04-16 02:08:00,wallstreetbets,"The argument to remove their license doesn’t come from the fact that they restricted buying on some stocks, in fact the politicians that support this would probably argue that they should have restricted buying even earlier to “protect investors who didn’t know any better.”

This is not a slippery slope fallacy, there is no leap in logic that needs to be made. This is the exact argument that politicians are making and if you don’t think that they will try and use the same argument to restrict your ability to trade as a retail investor you are either ignorant or in denial."
2021-04-16 00:28:27,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, what January showed was were not operating in a free market as retail investors.  Anytime a brokerage wants to take their ball and go home theres nothing retail investors can do about it."

2021-04-15 22:21:28,wallstreetbets,"Meh, I'd argue a counter on that.

Robinhood has made more than its fair share of stupid mistakes, all of which were pretty well documented on this sub over the years. Blocking just one, extremely irresponsible company, due to a lack of credibility, from making their citizens potentially lose money in ways that would otherwise could be unfair to the citizens is not necessarily a bad form of protection. There's other apps one can use as alternatives. It's not like they're blocking instagram or facebook.

I personally doubt this would become any type of habitually abused beaurocratic infrastructure used criminally to support specific 'approved' apps.

Additionally, if someone really wanted to get around it, you know the relevant instructions would be on the internet in a heartbeat. These types of bans never work."

What about predatory lending? You like that shit? Or maybe you think most of the rules of the SEC to protect us are bullshit too. Circuit breakers? Just let me sell my shit, why do you have to ""protect"" me from selling??

Robinhood has a lot of horribly predatory practices that the thousands of other broker-dealers in the US don't have in their systems/apps. They have a track record of being fined for shady shit and apparently they're not even following SEC regulations for fractional shares.

Here's the full email ....

To our Massachusetts customers:

Hi (my first name), 
You may have heard some news about Massachusetts regulators and Robinhood. 
We strongly reject the unfounded allegations made against us and are defending against this meritless action. We fully intend to continue serving our Massachusetts customers. 
To be clear: today’s news has no impact on your account. 
You can learn more about what’s going in our blog post and get the facts in our Help Center. 

Does this impact the money in my account? 
No, this decision by Massachusetts does not impact your funds. 

Is Robinhood going away for Massachusetts customers? 
We love Massachusetts and our Massachusetts customers, and we fully intend to continue serving you for the long term. We welcome the opportunity to correct the record on both the facts and the law, and expect to prevail in state court. 
If I’m currently a Massachusetts resident, can I still trade? 
Yes. You still have access to your Robinhood account as usual. The pending litigation does not have any impact on your account. 
Does this impact customers in any other states?
No. There is also no impact for customers who are not residents of Massachusetts. 
Sincerely,
The Robinhood Team"

They may or may not be doing more illegal things that haven't been uncovered. But all of that is speculative.

I purposefully cited an extreme to highlight that the claim that ""we don't need protection from predatory practices"" is flawed. I only need one, lock-tight counterexample to prove that statement wrong.

Granted, the comment was ""we don't need protection from **these** predatory practices"", so I'll admit my Madoff point doesn't do anything to refute that. But I said it because I often see people mad about their ""freedoms"" being taken away for things like these without realizing that sometimes we need that. Consumer protection is important, so it's naive to be against regulatory action on Robinhood simply because it prevents you from doing something.

But ultimately you're right, Madoff is an extreme that Robinhood isn't. But who knows, maybe they'll get investigated and someone will uncover some wild scam. Obviously that's unrealistic, but it'd be interesting for sure."

2021-04-15 20:12:47,wallstreetbets,"My mention of ponzi/pyramid scheme was just a concrete example of a predatory practice, Robinhood is definitely not that.

But I don't think the issue is at all that they restricted trading. The issue is they've shown a history of predatory practice, some of which are pointed out in the article.

The ""gamification"" is just the tip of the iceberg. I think that's a bullshit argument on its own, but when you look at the rest of what they've done, it certainly doesn't look good. Just a few of their shady things:

* PFOF fucking you over worse than most other fees from other brokerages
* Deferred cash settlement of your trades (I forget the name right now, but this was a big one brought up during the second Congressional hearing. They basically delay buying your stock because they know that most traders lose money on their platform and sell quickly, so they just settle things in cash)
* Not reporting fractional shares
* Hidden margin
* Ad/notification targeting toward inexperienced investors


I'm sure there are tons of others in the 24-page indictment, but Robinhood is pretty predatory."

2021-04-16 12:32:29,wallstreetbets,">the claim that ""we don't need protection from predatory practices"" is flawed 

That I definitely agree with.

I'm just not so sure I would consider gamification of trading to be ""predatory"" to the extreme that the government needs to stop it. At the end of the day, people are engaged in the same activities on Robinhood as many other reputable brokers. Robinhood making it simpler and more accessible is definitely not predatory. Quite the opposite, actually.

Maintaining esotericism as a barrier of entry to protect retarded people from losing their money is not a valid reason to ban RH.

Now, to your other point about the atrocious support and rampant bugs/glitches... *that* is what governments should be focusing on. Robinhood needs to demonstrate that it has a rock-solid system that gives customers support when they need it and otherwise abides by age-old trading laws. The fact that they're the most popular broker and have been in the game for almost a decade leaves them no excuse as to why their shit isn't sorted.

This attempt at banning RH is misguided and for the wrong reasons which is why people are all hot and bothered."

But claiming that RH is preying on its customers and luring them in with candy only to pull the rug out from under them is a much more exciting and relatable story!

RH has done an incredible job in the accessibility department. The first time you see something like IB's dated 90s look is enough to turn most people off.

Blaming RH's intuitive and understandable design is like blaming Google for Nigerian princes scamming people out of their life savings simply because they make a nice email client that's easy to use. Google does have a responsibility to attempt to protect people from those scams with auto-filtering and scan notifications, but if somebody ignores all that and goes out of their way to get scammed, there's not a whole lot you can do to prevent that.

It's not like RH is enticing people to buy stocks or leading them on. Like they said in their response, showing somebody how a stock is performing is absolutely *not* a recommendation. It's information. At a certain point, people have to take control of their own lives and need to be held responsible for their actions. You can't blame everything that goes wrong on somebody else."

2021-04-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Is this post motivated by my own personal agenda? Yes. Yes it is, but this RKT play also makes sense so it's worth getting out there. I watch lines move all day, but this is not financial advice. Truly, do what you will with this info. 

RKT has been seasoning for nearly a year. It has had time to establish a suppressed trend, and now it's time test new highs with a new trend very soon. This could also be last time to get in before the new trend establishes a higher floor. 

We should know the company's fundamentals are solid at this point, just find all the DD on it and read up if you don't. They make bank and continue to innovate RAPIDLY. I've been in through it all since IPO. 

**To more pressing matters, I believe there is a large option profit possibility here.** 

I believe whales are trying to make a lot of money off of options with RKT. They tried last week and failed. This week has more attention so I yolo'd 200 calls before the bell today - $23 strikes were 15 cents each. It closed at 22.76 today.  Max pain was well below 22.5 today, and shorts got wrecked before close. I am up 33% on those calls already in 5 seconds (for now). 

It could possibly gamma squeeze but it’ll probably need 50 Mil in volume. See picture below for open interest at $23 04/16). **That's half the float in volume, but only double the daily average**. When it went to $43 in March we did 368 mil in volume. 

There is 21k in open interest contracts at $23 calls 04/16s. There was a 10.5 million buy AH today (see picture). I saw another 89,920 share buy at 22.76 16:36:13 time stamp as I am typing this. Money is flowing in...why? My best guess is that the stock clearly is undervalued and institutions want to start making money on it sooner than later as they have been accumulating since IPO. 

Due to the small float, this stock MOVES parabolic on volume. Great company as we know at this point, but the stock sucks most of the time. It's constantly suppressed, but on the days it's not boring, those green candle sticks sky rocket on a 90 degree angle like there is no tomorrow. Meaning...options earn profits really really fast. So if it happens, don't get too greedy because theta will burn your options quick. I am hoping for a 25.5 - 27  per share to exit my calls with hopes of exercising. If it doesn't start early in the day, then ill probably roll my calls over to next week.

To make this happen - we need a catalyst (which is a possibility big money knows something), or we just need some retail help when the attack begins. Fair value IMO is $65, but I'll take somewhere between 25-30 before earnings. Lifetime PT $350a share by 2023. 

Just an FYI: this stock is notorious for false hope so expect the worse and hope for the best. I believe the low is $21 with a absolute worst case unlikely scenario of $18. So if you don't want to eff with the weeklies I would start buying shares here because it may not see $22 much longer and it's low risk to buy shares here IMO.  I also very confident in my June calls because they crush earnings every time - this will be their official 4th reported earnings as a public company.  I would anticipate that they want to leave the market will some fire news so that they utilize market cap for larger market share. RKT was never supposed to be a one hit wonder. 

TLDR: I like the stock and you should too. Keep an eye on it tomorrow if you can. Do with this what you will.

Honestly best chance of spiking this stock will be when earnings are released next.  Given that the banks crushed their #'s, highly likely RKT will as well."
2021-04-16 02:05:15,wallstreetbets,"They sell mortgages, right? isn't the market absolutely terrible for the past few months? There is very high demand in most of the US and very little supply, I suspect because people that wouldn't sold their houses didn't due to the pandemic. So, wouldn't that mean that their earnings, might actually be lower this time around then their last one?? 

EDIT: Also, those calls. It's not that unusual to me. Seems like RKT has been trading sideways since 3/31. So, those calls $23 call. isn't that a resistance? Maybe those calls are just someone taking a big gamble that after trading for so long there will be a big break out tomorrow. Doesn't have to mean that the ""Know something"". If someone bought 20k $25 calls. That would be way more unusual and maybe make me think they know something. For instance. Last week someone bought $2.2 million worth of calls between $15 and $20 strike in AMC. I think they did it last thursday. It has been mentioned in a few DD's. That is very unusual. being that at the time AMC share was at around $8.20 lol. That is making a lot of people think they know something. If it was just a really huge gamble, they must be filthy rich and it's nothing to lose all that money to them. It's still there. They didn't roll it over."
2021-04-16 02:19:04,wallstreetbets,I can only do one short at time so Sold RKT to buy AMC And  GME! If you don’t mind waiting I will be there as soon as I can! 😎 💎🙌🏻🦍🚀🌕

2021-04-16 05:07:24,wallstreetbets,"It would be interesting to see the reverse trades that got him down to only $3k to invest. It’s a casino. You see the $20k win, but never here of the 10x $2k losses."
2021-04-15 23:01:47,wallstreetbets,Lol I don’t think this is acceptable in the WSB circle

2021-04-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,$CLNE YOLO Day 5. Increased my position by 67% at the low cause MAMA DIDN'T RAISE NO BITCH! Averaged down nicely 
2021-04-16 06:18:35,wallstreetbets,Bloomberg: Biden is explicitly calling out methane as a target for combating climate change. Capturing methane is an obvious way to do that! Go $CLNE which is the RNG leader and has the infrastructure fully built to turn captured RNG (methane) and utilize that in trucking fleets.
2021-04-16 05:30:25,wallstreetbets,Almost got some at $1 a contract right before the bell but still didnt get a fill. Finally pulled the trigger earlier in the day at 1.05 though so cant complain. Hopefully that BP partnership spikes it into next week
2021-04-16 10:42:49,wallstreetbets,hopefully it fucks that 12c guy pressuring the stock

2021-04-15 20:36:21,wallstreetbets,"Nice!

2021-04-16 11:11:04,wallstreetbets,Are you guys fucking insane?! Your broker places undesired orders and you are still with them????
2021-04-16 01:38:31,wallstreetbets,I’ve broke my Calculator on my iPhone typing in too many crazy GME sums and all my saved searches on AutoTrader are Lamborghinis now
2021-04-16 05:23:56,wallstreetbets,"Lol was looking for something like.. Nah they cool, the director has gme or they wouldnt dare. I will bias myself than 😁"
2021-04-15 20:11:24,wallstreetbets,"IMO, doesn’t even have to be MOASS. When RC & Co announce their plans and announce new deals, this shit is gonna fly."
2021-04-15 20:50:59,wallstreetbets,"yeah, I had about 500shares at -70% down, bought in at 338 and kept averaging down. seeing it at $40 im thinking shit, Ive already lost it all. might as well go all in and doubled down and bought another 500 shares. the next day DFV doubled down as well.. the relief I felt when king of the apes had my back. and then the shares shot back up... what a lucky dumb move I made"
2021-04-15 20:44:04,wallstreetbets,"Show off. 

Now, if you don’t mind, I’ll get back to rummaging through my neighbour’s place for shit to sell so I can get to Monday with enough money for a PBR, a soft taco and an option contract on any juicy stock trading below $1.74."
2021-04-16 13:32:26,wallstreetbets,"I left after I had a sell order that didn’t go through, they are very fraudulent.

And anyone still with them has Down syndrome"
2021-04-16 16:28:33,wallstreetbets,"Already looked into it but it doesn’t looks like you can actually transfer out of it. With eToro you don’t actually own the shares, eToro does, which is why we can’t do things like vote either. The only way to get out is by selling and I’m not doing that. Happy to be proven wrong but this is how it is as far as I’m aware"
2021-04-16 05:35:17,wallstreetbets,hahaha thats true but I also need more features like options trading and shit
2021-04-15 22:36:24,wallstreetbets,">I get that but yolo implies alot of risk and there is virtually none 
  
  
Not shocking that someone thinking there's ""virtually no risk"" in a meme stock doesn't know ""alot"" isn't a word."
2021-04-16 04:43:28,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, the MOASS would be great but I reckon even without it GME is 6X-10X play just on its own merits with RC and friends at the helm!"
2021-04-15 22:21:21,wallstreetbets,"Haha yeah those were my thoughts exactly  ..

After the squeeze was quashed by RH the long thesis was still in play.

I was just hoping to get my money back within a year (PT = $100) so I can't complain."
2021-04-15 20:47:37,wallstreetbets,Ive just accepted the fate

2021-04-16 00:48:12,wallstreetbets,Wtf is with this stock lately tho. Every day I hear more shit about chip shortages and it just flops around while SPY moons over and over
2021-04-16 15:18:28,wallstreetbets,"AMD+TSM is literally half my portfolio. This chip shortage is going to benefit this pairing big time. Nvda/Intl are nowhere near AMD in terms of innovation, and can't touch TSM in fabrication. Moon soon baby."
2021-04-15 23:09:02,wallstreetbets,"Hey op, just curious is this ToS? My screen doesn't look like this, with the tabs on the bottom."
2021-04-16 00:06:23,wallstreetbets,TSM is worse than BB. Good news makes red days.
2021-04-16 07:47:19,wallstreetbets,Be happy it dropped so we can buy more
2021-04-16 15:16:44,wallstreetbets,It's because tech stocks are all that matter to normies and big money apparently. Wait until they can't sell anymore iPhones because they run out of chips. TSM will carry us to Valhalla.
2021-04-16 07:46:43,wallstreetbets,Yes it is. Just click on the position you have
2021-04-16 15:20:10,wallstreetbets,Would’ve thought a high end custom chip maker qualifies as a tech stock but I guess not. Whatever. Buying more.

2021-04-16 11:19:18,wallstreetbets,Well it's happening
2021-04-16 12:53:23,wallstreetbets,Can always drop a few bucks on 2023 puts .. there should be a correction by then and you won’t get killed by theta
2021-04-16 02:17:25,wallstreetbets,So basically you are banking on the whole market dropping a decent amount......?
2021-04-16 06:09:36,wallstreetbets,40-50% increase in a year is very normal for SPY.
2021-04-16 08:04:50,wallstreetbets,Totally normal. Have a look at the charts yourself for over the past 5 years etc. Looks like if you want to be short on SPY you need to time it exactly right as it dips 5-10 dollars.
2021-04-16 18:55:27,wallstreetbets,It was 7.8% in 15 days. That was a few days ago. SPY avg is right around there - for the YEAR.
2021-04-15 22:28:33,wallstreetbets,I don’t think people understand that earnings will come up and these historically high PE’s will come crashing down. They are taking earnings from a year of lockdowns and are assuming earnings will be similar this year. They won’t. Earnings are gonna propel this market to Pluto.

>From your GME shares!

>Just one share of GME contains billions of ~~strands of DNA~~ naked short sales, the building blocks of a hedge fund portfolio. 

>A naked short sale like me is a blueprint for building a bankrupted company. And sometimes companies that went extinct millions of years ago, like dinosaurs, left their blueprints behind for us to find. We just had to know where to look. 

>100 millions years ago there were shorted GME stocks, just like today. And just like today, they fed on the blood of investors. Sometimes, after biting an investor, a shorted stock would land on the branch of a bull market and get stuck in the dark pool. After a long time, the dark pool would produce an ITM call option and become fossilised, just like a dinosaur bone, preserving the shorted stocks inside. This fossilised market, which we call FADF, waited for millions of years with the synthetic shares inside, until Ken Griffin’s scientists came along.

>Using sophisticated techniques, they extract the preserved short sales from the call options, and bingo! Shorted GME! A full ITM Call Option contains 3 billion shares. If we looked at screens like these once a second for 8 hours a day, it’d take 2 years to look at the entire float. It's that long. 

>Since it's so old, it's full of holes. Now that's where our ~~geneticists~~ hedge funds take over.

>Thinking machine super-computers and HFT sequencers break down the trade orders in minutes. And virtual-reality displays show our MM the gaps in the buy orders. We used the completed sell orders of a paperhands to fill in the holes and complete the wash trade.

>Whew!

The only reason they are doing this is because they can profit from it. Some analyst there probably decided that the average black family now has enough to take out a loan with us so let’s target them and make it look good. 

Maybe I’m cynical. If they are doing good then go for it but something tells me these guys only do good when it’s benefits them. I don’t think I know of a single case where gentrification of an area with lots of new developments has benefitted the poor community of an area."

2021-04-15 22:32:00,wallstreetbets,"Lol. That was pedantic as fuck. Yeah you're right there are other components for ""fossil fuel emissions."" CO2 makes up the vast majority of said emissions.

> Fossil fuel is a general term for buried combustible geologic deposits of organic materials, formed from decayed plants and animals that have been converted to crude oil, coal, natural gas, or heavy oils by exposure to heat and pressure in the earth's crust over hundreds of millions of years.
The burning of fossil fuels by humans is the largest source of emissions of carbon dioxide, which is one of the greenhouse gases that allows radiative forcing and contributes to global warming.

https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/fossil_fuel.htm"
2021-04-15 20:05:58,wallstreetbets,"Yeah and that's not a good thing, right?"
2021-04-15 22:44:26,wallstreetbets,"you're the one being pedantic by going with the formal definition of ""emissions"".

My point is that normally when talking about combustion, the word ""emissions"" doesn't even include CO2, especially in cars. And for good reason - unlike other pollutants it doesn't really make you sick.

Even your own fucking link is saying this, so maybe try reading what you posted first before replying:

> Often, when we discuss the dangers of fossil fuel combustion, it's in the context of CO2 and climate change and overlook the potential health impact of the pollutants co-emitted with greenhouse gases"
2021-04-16 09:36:30,wallstreetbets,"We've been in agreement, you just misunderstood my first comment."
2021-04-15 22:51:27,wallstreetbets,"You're delightful.

I'm being pedantic by going with the formal definition of ""emissions?"" The original CBS link I posted is talking about fossil fuel emissions. Then you so eloquently replied, ""emissions != CO2."" This whole thread is talking about carbon emissions and investing in green energy, but now you want to talk about a usage of emissions that doesn't include CO2 because that doesn't make people sick? Okay.

Edit: I see you've edited out calling me a ""moron"" and ""saying dumb shit"""
2021-04-15 23:48:50,wallstreetbets,"> The original CBS link I posted is talking about fossil fuel emissions

Yes, but specifically, it's talking about the particulate matter emissions, rather than greenhouse emissions, which is my whole point as well.

You posted that link in response to someone asking how many people die due to ""carbon emissions"". I interpret ""carbon emissions"" to basically mean CO2, but no one's dying from breathing CO2.

It's not just a pedantic distinction either, because different ways of burning fuels produce vastly different PM emissions, but CO2 emissions don't depend on burning method.

> Edit: I see you've edited out calling me a ""moron"" and ""saying dumb shit""

yeah, sorry :( I got carried away"

2021-04-16 05:23:20,wallstreetbets,"You should have waited, GME is on a downtrend currently. I think we see it go back down under a hundred and recycle back up, shorts are covering slowly on these cycles and burning options on these spike ups. I mean if you really wanted to YOLO, TSLA ran $100 since Monday. AMD ITM options yesterday morning went %1000 by noon. There are better plays than simply GME. If you have conviction and dont need the money like Mark said than by all means hold. But keep in mind that while you are holding the market is still going strong and you are actively losing out on unrealized gains as an investor."

2021-04-15 20:53:45,wallstreetbets,I’m gonna jump in on this too. What should my strike be and what’s a good date?
2021-04-15 21:01:10,wallstreetbets,"This isn't financial advice but I think there is really two plays right now, their flight is supposed to be in May. If all goes well the stock should be way up by june/july, I personally like those calls. The other way to go would be Leaps for 2023.

I can't really give much advice on the strike.   
I picked 50 because I'm expecting it to run up very similar to how it did last time and it held 50-60 for awhile before it dropped. 

Someone told me earlier closer to the current strike price is better but i'm just a low tier ape. 

🤷‍♂️"

They'll turn up your driveway, not even know for sure why they're doing it.  They'll arrive at your door, innocent as children, longing for the past.  ""Of course we don't mind if you look around,"" you'll say.  ""It's only $20 per person.""  And they'll hand over the money without even thinking about it.  For it is money they have, and peace they lack.

And they'll walk out to the bleachers...sit in ahirtsleeves, on a perfect afternoon.  They'll find they have reserved seats.  Somewhere, up along one of the baselines, where they sat when they were children, and cheered their heroes.  They'll watch the game, and it'll be as if they'd dipped themselves in magic waters.  The memories so thick, they'll have to brush them away from their faces.  

""You'll lose everything, Ray.""

People will come, Ray.

""You'll be evicted!""

The one constant through all the years, Ray, has been baseball.  America has rolled by like an army of steamrollers.  It's been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt, and erased again.  But baseball ⚾️ ☝🏾...has marked the time.  This field, this game, is a part of our past, Ray.  It reminds us of all that once was good, and could be again.

Massachusetts Seeks Revocation of Robinhood’s Registration (WSJ)

Massachusetts securities regulators on Thursday asked that Robinhood Financial LLC’s registration as a broker-dealer in the state be revoked to prevent the popular online brokerage from doing business there.

The regulators said Robinhood has “continued a pattern of aggressively inducing and enticing trading among its customers,’’ in a follow-up filing to a complaint filed by the state against the company in December.

The state pointed to recent decisions by Robinhood, including its promotion giving customers cash rewards based on new deposits, as demonstrative of “a firm culture which has not changed” after the filing of the December complaint. It added that Robinhood’s actions pose “a substantial and continued risk to Massachusetts investors.”

In a response, Robinhood said in a blog post Thursday that “the complaint reflects the old way of thinking: That new, younger, and more diverse investors don’t have a place in the markets.”

“By trying to block Robinhood, the division is attempting to bring its residents back in time and reinstate the financial barriers that Robinhood was founded to break down,” the company said.

December’s complaint, filed by the office of William Galvin, the secretary of the commonwealth, accused the brokerage of aggressively marketing to inexperienced investors and failing to implement controls to protect them. Robinhood previously has disputed the allegations and pointed to its role in expanding investing to individuals, a sentiment the company reiterated in a new court filing of its own against the state’s securities regulators on Thursday.

In an interview, Mr. Galvin said Thursday’s filing seeking to amend the original December complaint came after “it became clear that [Robinhood] was not going to change their conduct.”

“They simply refuse to acknowledge that they have a duty to their customers to treat them as investors and not just people who are being entertained and being lured into investing money with them,” he said.

The original filing from Mr. Galvin’s office was filed as an administrative complaint instead of in court, meaning that the case will be handled by a hearing officer.

On Thursday, Robinhood also filed a complaint of its own against Mr. Galvin and the Massachusetts Securities Division in state court.

In its complaint and motion for preliminary injunctive relief, the company argued that a recently adopted fiduciary rule in Massachusetts—which state regulators have accused Robinhood of violating—should be invalidated. It also asked that the December complaint against the company not proceed until the matter can be resolved.

The fiduciary standard, adopted last year, requires broker-dealers to act in their clients’ best interest. Mr. Galvin’s complaint against Robinhood marked the first enforcement action of the rule."

GME short squeeze, which Einhorn said inflamed the retail-fueled trading fracas.

“Finally, we note that the real jet fuel on the [GameStop] squeeze came from Chamath Palihapitiya and Elon Musk, whose appearances on TV and Twitter, respectively, at a critical moment further destabilized the situation,” Einhorn wrote.

* Einhorn’s quarterly letter also revealed lackluster performance by the investment manager, who saw a 0.1% decline in the first three months of the year, even as the benchmark S&P 500 SPX notched a gain of around 6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP also recorded solid returns.*

-	Microvision releases PR in the morning that they have a LIDAR sample ready or even better, a buyout is happening
-	the stock shoots up 
-	people have been buying April calls in anticipation of the sample release for months 
-	all those calls go ITM and the stock goes vertical even more
-	the stock is shorted to hell (only 15k left on iBorrow desk) so the shorts fumble to cover  -> more vertical movement
-	at this point MVIS is worth more than FANG combined 
-	the sell off begins and it tumbled to $10 by noon
-	I go on lunch and check my stocks: hmm MVIS still at $10, I guess I’ll keep holding, I say as I bite into my dollar menu burger"
2021-04-16 08:55:48,wallstreetbets,"Might do a more comprehensive DD/Technical post with charts later, but looking at the market currently there's some things to note:  
- Both SPY (/ES) and QQQ (/NQ) have pulled away from their 21/50 day SMAs and are a large way away from their 200 day SMA. If you look at the past year, when these gaps have widened significantly we have had a pull back, a regression to the mean.   
- We are coming down off a massive peak in GEX (gamma exposure) which will probably unwind today given the monthly opex. Edit: Forgot to mention this has generally preceded (exacerbated) volatility in the market.   
- For the last three months, the back-end of the month has been choppy to the downside, post-monthly opex it would seem.   
We could very well grind higher for another week, but if the pattern follows I would expect us to see volatility to the downside towards the end of the month, and significant at that, not just chop. Thinking %7-10 pullback is possible here."

They have some of the best employee retention rates in the retailer industry due to the training and incentives they provide and on top of that they have the best margins of any chain store due to them selling in individual sizes and not bulk, coupled with mediocre customer service(their ceo understands people aren’t going to dg for the customer service) and they are mostly in places where Walmart or other grocery stores arent so no competition.

All these things are though is the big words people who  go to college use  - distraction - just to try to make you seem dumber and to confuse you.

All you need to look at to be rich is current price and then finger the public sentiment (how much people like it). Get really deep in there on that one. Now all you need is to know this: A gud stock will go into the 100s, really gud to 1000's. If they are gud or really good and cheaper than that ^ they are going there. 

Dog coin is gud so it goes to $100s. COIN is really good so it goes to $1,000s. TSLA is reallllly gud so it goes to $10,000+. Don't listen when they try to say about how that will make them worth more than most countries or some nonsense. That's just there distraction again. They're mad when people like us are in a lambo.

2021-04-16 03:49:06,wallstreetbets,"Say QQQ is at $300 then goes down $30 (10%) to 270 but then bounces back $30 to where it started which means it goes up (11.11%). A triple leveraged fund would go down 30% but then back up 33.33% in the same time. Say the triple leveraged fund was $100 at the start. Going down 30% would take it to $70 but then back up 33% actually only leaves you at $93.33 which means that while the underlying etf broke even, the leveraged one lost money. Basically in a period where it declines in price the losses are harder to make back. Over the years qqq has basically been going straight up so tqqq has returned way more but periods of stagnation carry much larger risks for leveraged funds"

2021-04-16 00:28:16,wallstreetbets,10 bagger is a 1000 percent return. Technically that is only a 9 bagger though if you subtract your initial investment.

2021-04-16 00:26:59,wallstreetbets,"Has to be 10x, though I’m more of an expert in bag holding (ie “I’m a 10time bag holder”)"

2021-04-16 04:11:22,wallstreetbets,I haven’t looked at any of their financials but here are my thoughts. I’m sure Coinbase has a large amount of crypto holdings directly but their revenue I believe should mostly only affected by volume of transactions not the price of the underlying. Nonetheless I’m sure the day to day trading of COIN stock will be affected by crypto prices because traders will use that as a gauge of how much interest there is in crypto

2021-04-16 14:43:57,wallstreetbets,"I don't think they are going to have a post covid recovery. Just to recap this last couple of years. The company goes public in 2019 with one working craft. The previous craft was destroyed in 2014 killing the crew. They have only had a handful of powered flights with the new craft. 

Last year both Richard Branson and Chamath Palihapitiya the people who launched the IPO in the first place sold off millions of shares. They also hired an ex disney executive to run the company. 

The idea that the company is ready to run like a theme park and start taking customers is absurd to me. They have a shoddy safety record, founders who are bailing out, and leadership that isn't oriented toward the safety and reliability of the spacecraft. 

Add to this that the whole point of this company is to give tourists a high G launch into a 6min zero-G free fall then landing. The only edge this has over the vomit comet is that you cross the kermin line. The price to that edge is $250k vs the vomit comet which is $5k. Is the pride of paying to go to space worth a ride that is not nearly as safe and $245k more expensive?

Again they haven't sold a single ticket so maybe there is an untapped market of mega-rich celebrities that want to pay for the gaudy Under Armor flight suits and the esteem that comes from saying you have been to space.

There are bright spots like some of the talks about satellite launches that haven't been demonstrated and would involve redesigning literally everything they have made so far.  

In all VG doesn't seem like a genuine attempt to serve customers. It's more like a billionaire's side project that might have been able to sell a seat or two. Now that billionaire is selling off the side project because his airline is eating shit during the pandemic.

I don't like the stock."

If you're right, you'll be collecting premium hand over fist. If not, you'll have shares at a more reasonable price, which you could wheel until hitting break even 😉"

2021-04-16 15:42:50,wallstreetbets,"I am neutral on the stock after QS responded to the short report.  This reminds me of Nikola and Trevor Milton...Trevor went out of the way to respond to the short report and eventually got busted out. Companies are really have nothing to hide and are about to turn it around and do well will not waste a second to a short report like that. Take a look at GME....they completely ignored all the short report and the frenzy with the exception of Cohen just tweeting some Coded memes. Now we know that Cohen is going to turn GME around into a 50+billion market value company just like he did with chewy. I would have been bullish after the short report if QS didn't respond. The fact that they responded on twitter in multiple tweets/paragraphs, made me neutral and lean towards being a bear. I have a feeling the stock will rally a bit to trick few ppl into long position then fall even harder."

There could be some manipulation there from QS, but who knows. 

I have a long position. The ceiling is high. I'm ok with it going to zero for the 1% chance they knock it out of the park and totally change the battery market."

2021-04-15 23:50:17,wallstreetbets,I watched the Scorpion Capital interview. When pressed for specifics their response was vague misgivings with the metrics QS uses and an unwillingness to name their experts. No mention of VW’s recent review of QS tech at VW’s battery lab in Germany and associated $100mm investment. This isn’t a bunch of old money VC’s handing money over to Elizabeth Holmes with no understanding of the domain. VW has massive technical due diligence capabilities.

2021-04-15 23:38:20,wallstreetbets,Hmmm... this is very vague..   I'm not invested but do have a position in lucid.  This looks bad for the whole industry.  Even VW looks bad and DESPERATE in all this so this doesn't quite redeem qs.  the report is just as sketchy though.  Bad all around.

we just have to wait and our tendies will come as soon as there's further development."
2021-04-16 00:10:12,wallstreetbets,I’d reconsider that tbh. VW just released 100M to QS after their batteries were tested in German by VW.
2021-04-16 15:43:10,wallstreetbets,"Agree Pr piece at best, nothing verifiable in the report."
2021-04-16 09:57:21,wallstreetbets,Do you really think their product doesn't exist? Bill gates is an investor. VW had the batteries two weeks ago in their laboratories in Germany and after that they released another 100 m $ for further innovation. I think they loaded the batterie at least once to check if it works or not 😂
2021-04-16 12:56:36,wallstreetbets,"The ""report"" is just so stupid he doesn't want to waste time on it, he is actually working on the company not responding to snake trolls."
2021-04-16 10:51:26,wallstreetbets,"I m a CIA agent and in my experience the report seems to have stolen aliens tech. I ve seen it at Area 51. Insane technology that powers rockets to the Moon! 

Sorry for the tease.

Can you provide more insights into the technical aspect if you are a physicist?"
2021-04-16 12:57:38,wallstreetbets,I think you are clueless.
2021-04-16 12:59:06,wallstreetbets,No thanks I rather follow the facts.
2021-04-16 01:04:10,wallstreetbets,Wth does Elon have to do with any of this lmao.
2021-04-16 13:54:46,wallstreetbets,Elon is doing his own thing and welcomes competition. He will probably just buy QS when their tech is proven.
2021-04-16 13:52:50,wallstreetbets,They don't have the same tech as QS. They have been researching SS batts for a long time with a lot of trial and error. QS is waaay ahead of the game. Nobody truly knows what they have and that is why they don't want to disclose anything too soon without the prototype. Upscale and ready for mass production are the next steps.
2021-04-16 02:47:44,wallstreetbets,"The report makes QS and VW seem bad. That is clear. However, the report stakes a lot on the claim that VW only received powerpoint slides and never got to actually see the battery, yet that news release says VW tested something in their lab in Germany. I don't quite understand how the short report can simply ignore a news release from two weeks back, unless they did not want to deal with it as they had no answer.

Scorpion Capital clearly bought all those puts near closing yesterday and sold them today, probably making about 5X on their money. Really the SEC should step in here, as if they deliberately ignored data that challenges their claims in order to drop the price and to profit then I think that is market manipulation. I thought you are only allowed to make claims you believe are true and I am suggesting that Scorpion Capital deliberately misrepresented things to make QS looks bad."
2021-04-16 10:30:02,wallstreetbets,"Sure it exists, the claim is that they're vastly overstating what they've achieved and hoping the science catches up to their claims. I do agree that the report about the germany battery tests contradicts the short report, but there's not much substance that either. Just a few lines on QS website that says they met a ""technical milestone"" whatever that means. That's supposed to stand up to 200 pages of FUD? Sure bill gates and VW are backing them, and maybe they will succeed in the very long term, but the ROI on that investment may be way further out than QS is letting on. 

I don't care either way i just want tendies."
2021-04-16 14:04:21,wallstreetbets,"Bill hates investing couple hundred mil is also the equivalent of you buying a $100 FD. 

Now if Bill YOLOs half his networth call me up."
2021-04-16 13:22:16,wallstreetbets,"Shit is hard to do. And there are thousands of scientists trying to do it. What are the odds that QS just magically comes up with the solution without working on it for years?

They aren’t presenting any sort of indication that they’ve had a breakthrough. I would expect the breakthrough to first come from a lab and be published in a scientific journal such as Nature or Science, and then be patented by the university and spun out to a startup. That’s not what’s happened here 

What’s happened here is a startup, which has every motive to fake it before you make it, has come out with pretty far out there claims. 

I guess I see the narrative where they’ve achieved something in the lab which has negligible ability to be scaled into mass production. 

Something like 40% efficient multilayer solar cells that can never be manufactured at large scale. They exist in the lab, but they can’t get out into the real world.

You’d be surprised the amount of money institutions will throw at things because it sounds and looks cool. Often they are more interested in appearances than in the actual merits and body of supporting work/evidence. Appearances make money, it attracts investment, it keeps the con going, it buys time to truly innovate in house.  

Otherwise, how can legacy automakers possibly catch up to Tesla? They are Billions in the hole in sunk cost capital and they have no battery build out. 

Tesla has proven that these legacy automakers were really zombie companies just persisting from sheer momentum, refusing to see the writing on the wall regarding the green tech revolution and set driving enabled by AI."

Chamath also regularly plays high stakes poker and gambles hundreds of thousands. Does this mean he’s a pro? 

Well to Bill gates. A $10m pipe is less than a percent of his net worth.

2021-04-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Simple bear case for gold and gold miners. RGLD play shown. Firstly, as a novice individual investor I am not qualified to offer investment advice, so this is not investment advice. This is my attempt to support a personal investment thesis that led to my put options positions. Tell me your thoughts in this DD. Did I miss something? Do you agree?

The following image shows a spliced version of a ten year chart to more easily compare the decline in the gold spot price during similar periods of economic stimulus.

&#x200B;

[GOLD SPOT PRICE DROP REPEAT?](https://preview.redd.it/xxe410k9gdt61.jpg?width=380&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=82efe65c4dc441a7130ce45912f94aa28cdb2cc2)

Much like we should expect in the 2013 reference, there are a few retests of highs, and the results were lower highs and lower lows. The yearlong trend was definitely downward. We see the same in the 2021 redline. These observations are obvious, but the important part of this spliced chart is the \~$200 drop in the spot price after failure of the fourth support test. I believe that this economic stimulus period will bring a repeat of that mid-2012 to mid-2013 time when investment capital shifted into confidence in the economic outlook. If I am correct, then a similar \~$200 drop in the gold spot price could be as near as tomorrow or as far as June. If the price drop is a % rather than a flat price drop, then the delta of the cliff could be between $250 or $300. In short, I believe gold approaches a \~15% cliff that could happen over a single day or week.

Even though I have been thinking about investing in gold product retailers mid-year (jewelry, electronic circuits and connectors), I have always preferred to invest in gold miners when I get that gold bug. I am not a bull or bear. I am a for-profit investor only. This increasing confidence in the economic outlook after so many challenges puts me in the bear camp now. When expecting big moves I usually consider trading in higher value names, and my recent positions in anticipation of this cliff down includes RGLD, a long established name in the gold trading sector that supports gold miners and gold investors as a ""streams and royalties"" company. I bought put options despite the jump in the gold spot price today, and the subsequent rise in the stock price of RGLD.

1. $115p May 21 '21 (x1) at cost $5.50
2. $115p May 21 '21 (x1) at cost $3.80
3. $115p Apr 16 '21 (x2) at cost $0.50

**TLDR:** I believe that the gold spot price approaches a \~15% cliff that could happen over a single day or week, and my bet is that RGLD will be a profitable short play because of its close relation to gold miners and the gold spot price."
2021-04-15 20:27:14,wallstreetbets,You gotta be the dumbest person on the planet if you think gold is going down. It was a miracle of epic ignorance than it got this low in the first place. It never should have sold off from 2011. It has a 10 year upward correction coming soon.
2021-04-15 20:57:19,wallstreetbets,"Gold is correlated to periods of inflation, and and after  volatility. It is inverse to interest rates and real gdp growth.

I'm not going make any predictions just yet... the money printing and lowering of interest rates is quite bullish plus the infrastructure plan is effectively more stimulus money printing. One more crisis could cause gold to moon. 

The bear case is if we do have strong real economic growth and the fed stops lowering interest rates.

I wouldn't call the top in just yet... at this point it is wait and see."
2021-04-16 02:47:40,wallstreetbets,"I’m up to play devil’s advocate.

You took a snapshot of a chart from 2013 and a chart from 2021, put them side-by-side, and compared them. Here’s what you missed: the 2020 stock market drop was due to a (massive) correction in equities price based on calculated fear abs expectations. It was fair; big viruses hurt the economy. What you should be looking at however, is not 2013, but what happened a few years before it: a recession. Not a financial market correction, but a recession. It’s always darkest before dawn, but don’t forget about sunsets. We watch them for their beauty, but they disappear into blackness nonetheless. When the drop comes, and it will, gold and miners will take a hit, but their recovery will be BIG. And that recovery will continue all the way to the next 2013 (when equities become trusted again). 

I’m not saying your puts won’t work. They’re short dated. Just don’t get caught holding puts when gold is being purchased not for jewelry but for bunkers."
2021-04-16 12:58:44,wallstreetbets,"Short term I think you're right, but long term, inflation is probably going to escape the Fed's grasp and unless they shock the market by increasing the interest rate a large amount, gold will go up."

2021-04-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"HYLN Pt. 2: A Fair Warning Hey guys, I posted the DD about HYLN yesterday that got some traction on WSB, and I'm back with more insight. I tried posting this new discussion on both WSB and WSBOG right after market open, but it seems that my account has some issue with posting new threads -- none of my posts ever go through without mod approval, despite being added as a [contributor to the sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7l0p0/gme_disinfo_exposed_1_why_the_gme_moass_post_that/grburu2/).

Anyway, this time I'm posting about why you should be **wary** about short-term hype surrounding HYLN. I know that may shock you after yesterday's post, but read on -- you'll probably feel like I'm preaching to the choir, here.

# ...What?

Let me start by saying that I believe in the potential of this company -- its *long-term potential*. This isn't a short squeeze, this isn't a quick turn around, this isn't a few dollars you throw at some FDs. This is a stock with a **real** chance of going gangbusters in the next few years.

I've noticed [posts celebrating](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mrdeqb/hyliion_moon_time/) HYLN's premarket rise. HYLN is *often* green premarket and then descends into the fiery red depths of hell slightly after 9:30am. This is a common market manipulation technique: it's ***easy*** and ***cheap*** to buy stocks up during premarket/after hours because the float is so low, so it doesn't take much to push a stock up. Then, once the stock starts off high, and retail FOMO in, that's when the big boys dump the bags on you. **Premarket and AH mean jack shit.**

So why am I warning you? Because I've noticed some really suspicious activity since posting yesterday. I feel I owe it to you to let you know what I've noticed. Also, my parents raised me to be incredibly honest. Not gonna lie, it's a bit of a drawback sometimes, but like George ""Motherfucking"" Washington, I cannot tell a lie.

Also, this isn't entirely selfless -- paper hands sink stocks. I want you guys to know what you're getting into. I want you to know what we're up against. I want you to know why it's important to be in it for the long haul (haha trucking joke, get it?)

First, let's talk about APU.

# High APU Rating

This is something I wrote about in a previous post about [GME disinformation](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbh9xe/disinfo_exposed_2_how_hedge_funds_and_useful_apes/) that wasn't permitted on WSB: the APU ratio (Awards Per Upvote ratio).

I ran some numbers for the typical amount of awards for every upvote for randomly-selected posts from different categories of posts:

* Posts by DFV
* Pro-GME posts (during the period when it topped out the second time -- 1 month ago)
* Pro-silver posts
* Pre-GME DD posts

[You can see the results here.](https://i.postimg.cc/8zqqPrHx/Awards-Per-Upvote.png) I chose these categories, because I figured DFV's posts were a decent representation of organic posting in WSB -- they're easy to digest and impressive enough to merit awards. They're probably on the higher end of what an authentic post could expect to receive in terms of awards on WSB. When compared to pre-GME DD posts, you'll see that my theory stands correct: DFV's have an APU ratio almost 10x higher than pre-GME DD posts. DFV's post had an average APU of 0.0323.

I also looked at pro-silver posts, because there was a consensus that silver sentiment was being manipulated in WSB. It's no coincidence that silver died immediately the day after after media started pushing a misleading narrative that ""Silver had become the next GME"" ([Source](https://i.ibb.co/8bpLNv0/slvscam.png)). I noticed that silver posting had an APU higher than DFV's posts. The most upvoted pro-silver post had an APU **more than 3x DFV's average APU, and much higher than even his highest APU ratio.** Pro-GME posts were similarly high.

I ran some numbers on my own post yesterday, after someone raised this same suspicion.

The APU for [my post yesterday](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqrfzf/hyln_how_we_got_here_where_were_going_aka_the_moon/) was abnormally high. It's 0.0664, which is...:

* twice that of DFV's average
* higher than a random selection of 10/11 of DFV's higher-upvoted posts
* almost twice that of pro-GME posts (during a time of what I believe was ongoing astroturfing and positive sentiment manipulation)
* much higher than that of silver (though admittedly I used a small sample size)
* over 10x that of pre-GME WSB

Now, it's important to qualify this: taken alone, this data could just be merely coincidental. There's a lot that can explain it: gracious HYLN owners finally seeing their stock get its dues, random weirdness, etc. Taken alone, this data might not mean much. So let's contextualize it.

Let's look at...

# Suspicious social media activity

The [exact same user](https://i.ibb.co/KGRGKjt/censored.png) kept rewarding my post -- 9 awards over 7 hours. How often would you stick around 7 hours to award the exact same post?

Okay, not enough to be conclusive, but...

[Look at his account page](https://i.ibb.co/HK5xhfm/shillbot.png). Lots of warning flags:

* Extremely low karma
* Posts exclusively in WSB
* Has an award for gilding so many goddamn people
* Formed Jan 27th (which corresponds to a lot of pro-hedgie activity, based on my observations)

Okay, now in context the picture is starting to become a bit more clear...

Here's [one even better](https://i.ibb.co/HK5xhfm/shillbot.png) \-- this is what these guys like to do. They give a stock pick, give an extremely specific date. ""BUY TOMORROW IT'S GONNA EXPLODE"" and then the next two days the stock craters 10%.

I feel a bit like I'm wearing a tinfoil hat when I say shit like this, but do you think I'm making this up? [Think again](https://i.ibb.co/56LJp04/shortbot.png). If you (weak, puny, individual investor) buy, it's easier for them (hedge funds, billionaires, shorters, shitillionaires) to sell into your buys. They get a better price to short at, *and* they get to shake your paper hands.

In all honesty, I made some pretty good money finding these shills and inversing them. Even still, I tried to warn about them before, but my post was censored. This level of disgusting control and manipulation just does NOT sit right with me. If this thread is what helps expose this manipulative bullshit, I don't really care that it sacrifices a money-making strategy that I've used to 100% success up until now. Fuck hedge funds, basically. Fuck billionaires trying to shake a few cents from the little guy.

For the record, any time a poster whose name starts with ""**Ad**Something####"" (for, y'know, ***advertisement***) starts getting bullish on a stock, that  freaks me the fuck out. Especially if they only have a 2 month old account. Look around with a critical eye and you'll see what I'm talking about.

Oh, and remember yesterday in my posts when I talked about an account on Stocktwits that shitposts about HYLN literally all day every day? Well, [he's back](https://stocktwits.com/jshetty7200), and I can confirm that, based on his posting style and patterns, that's definitely him. Curious he came back the exact same day I made the HYLN bullish post, no?

**tl;dr:**

**HYLN is still being manipulated. Wouldn't be surprised if it continues trending down for the short-term as it shakes out weak paper hands. Think about why. I'm holding this stock until something FUNDAMENTAL changes about the company. Day-to-day red and green doesn't change my thesis. Paper hands get shook.**"

2021-04-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Cattle Futures - buy the dip? Don't know what to buy? Buy SPX/SPY/ES and don't look back. Jeez how many times do we have to teach you, old man? 

Have a bit of spare change left? Consider buying some cattle, whose drop in the last few days does not make sense in light of faster economic growth and higher feed prices. 

[June 2021 Futures](https://preview.redd.it/6e9ns0kpbdt61.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e7e8427c27f04cc3e75c42e700a162fcf97aa08)

1. For cattle, the most important factor quite honestly is the supply. More cattle than what is demanded (domestically or internationally) means subdued prices. Right now, this is the primary driver, as [young calves raised in late 2020](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/animal-products/cattle-beef/market-outlook/) in anticipation of economic recovery in early 2021 are showing up on the lots. As of right now, demand is OK - just OK with Americans coming back to restaurants, even though the rest of the world isn't. Like what was driving oil prices (up to yesterday when the IEA upgraded all forecasts), the rest of the world is significantly lagging the US in recovery. 
2. Feed prices are critical to cattle as well (namely corn and soybeans). These have been on a tear in the past few weeks due to fewer than expected planted acres, and the current cold front across the midwest. If the feed becomes too expensive, it becomes more costly to fatten cattle, making less available to market, especially for the June contract as the time to fatten is now. 
3. The backlog is about to end. The massive oversupply has been in play for about 6 months already - from October to April. Every commodity has seen the same cycle post-pandemic - a massive depressing of prices, only for the entire market to realize they've been too pessimistic, and then sudden rally. 

&#x200B;

It seems like cattle is one of the last agri laggard - corn, soy, hogs and lumber have already punched through the roof. I'm heavily in corn gang, but overall I'm bullish all soft commodities. Buy a few contracts and see what happens, and I'll be sure to report back when I find 18 metric tons of beef on my front porch."

I casually check my witty comment good-boy-points during orgasm and I'm still not sure which is better.

Somedays you feel like getting degraded, triggering the gmetard in their thread for downvotes also works."
2021-04-16 09:03:27,wallstreetbets,That's our mission statement
2021-04-15 23:47:06,wallstreetbets,Factual delivery.
2021-04-15 23:33:41,wallstreetbets,"Just Google ""wsb fd"" and the first result is your answer with some context."
2021-04-16 00:05:22,wallstreetbets,"Options expiring within a week. 

This guy was expecting ASO to have a short squeeze and go up 25-30% within a week...GME took months"
2021-04-16 15:48:55,wallstreetbets,fast decay
2021-04-15 20:26:20,wallstreetbets,"Well, if you're going long on GME it's still a great buy, they have a world class team and a solid foundation. So regardless of a squeeze or not, I imagine it's going to be worth a *lot* more in a couple of years."
2021-04-16 01:36:19,wallstreetbets,"I totally missed the early DD (usually only sort by new) and was suffering from serious FOMO after seeing the second gains porn... But held true to my FOMO resolution.

Congrats on the gains!"
2021-04-16 00:41:57,wallstreetbets,Yeah that’s a pretty easy “read the room”
2021-04-15 20:10:48,wallstreetbets,"this. I make the most money when I pick an option right at open that i know will be super popular, put in a bid 10-20% over the last ask price and hope for the best. Then generally sell it within 10 minutes for a quick 30-50% profit and then I get to relax for the rest of the day."
2021-04-15 22:24:47,wallstreetbets,Aaah so that's the trick. Fight the greed and take profits as they present themselves.
2021-04-15 21:10:01,wallstreetbets,RIP 😢
2021-04-15 21:28:20,wallstreetbets,"At least put a limit buy at 0.01 on that poor sucker, it’s in everyone’s best interest"
2021-04-16 00:07:41,wallstreetbets,"Funny how there are multiple ways to play something correctly. I’ve been making pretty good money playing ASO only from the LONG side since it came up here. Can’t say it hasn’t treated me well. I suppose time is everything, yada yada yada. Something about lobster bisque."
2021-04-16 00:22:07,wallstreetbets,You know which is better... upvotes cames my pp
2021-04-16 11:11:16,wallstreetbets,sure but ur words say CAFFEINE!
2021-04-16 03:58:34,wallstreetbets,"Umm not really man lol. Current fundamental evaluation is around 20 dollars (just fundamentals, no short squeeze or any of that bullshit).

Even IF Ryan Cohen is a god and everything is amazing and they turn that around, increasing its fundamental value from 20 to 150 would take literal years (like any other retail companies such as APPL, etc). Basically if you buy right now just based on fundamentals, you are overpaying around 130 dollars and it would take probably 10 years or more (and that it IF business goes right, which is a big IF) to get to that true value."
2021-04-16 00:37:31,wallstreetbets,"Being stuck staring at those red fucking $00.01 options you can't even give away. Just a permanent reminder of your fuck up, months still to go before strike date. Taunting you incessantly.
*You fucking moron, you stupid piece shit. Too pathetic and  greedy to take profit. You knew this would happen it always does. Might as well just shit all over my self, smear myself in feces and drown in the river, maybe some birds can eat your eyeballs and you'll be off some use for once beyond wasting money, torching what you've worked months for because you're such a fucking retard.*"
2021-04-16 04:14:21,wallstreetbets,"I hear you, and I will, but c'mon shouldn't that kind of clean up be the market makers job"
2021-04-16 00:22:23,wallstreetbets,"Of course, timing is everything. I wasn't trying to shit all over anyone who invested, but the whole idea of being resentful when it hasn't had massively positive moves within a week is fucking loony. 

There's absolutely nothing in ASO's fundamentals that peg it as a >$20 stock. You can play momentum all you like (and win doing so), but whining that a stock didn't bump up by 45% in a week with the utter and complete lack of a catalyst past WSB discussion is a little remarkable, I think."
2021-04-16 10:45:00,wallstreetbets,RIP your puts
2021-04-16 13:43:12,wallstreetbets,"Bro your DD sucks dick, 20 dollars is just fucking retarded lowball. Just a thought."
2021-04-16 04:13:37,wallstreetbets,"alright alright, I'll buy em back for 1c :)"
2021-04-16 00:38:05,wallstreetbets,"Oh I agree fully. My comment wasn’t a retort.

Only thing I disagree with is the valuation. I believe it is great value at current price. But I’m not looking for a 30% gain in a couple weeks with quickly expiring options like OP lmao. However, I am looking for a further 10+% annualized return going forward through remainder of 2021 from current price. But different opinions are what make a market. So we shall see."
2021-04-16 11:01:37,wallstreetbets,"I don’t have any puts lol, not touching GME with a ten foot pole. Too impredictable, too volatile.

I like predictable things."
2021-04-16 16:34:03,wallstreetbets,"It is not though, it was 4 dollars a few months ago. 20 dollars is a 500% increase from 4 dollars which is insane, mainly driven due to Ryan Cohen’s good decisions, online shift and overall relative potential. Dude, +500% is fucking insane."
2021-04-16 00:13:05,wallstreetbets,fucking priceless
2021-04-16 02:35:50,wallstreetbets,What’s exactly what I was thinking 🤔
2021-04-16 06:41:02,wallstreetbets,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjVQ36NhbMk
2021-04-16 11:49:46,wallstreetbets,Oh but you sounded so sure about GME's value. Weird you wouldn't make money off that knowledge you have.
2021-04-16 11:51:30,wallstreetbets,Then what in Keith Gill’s name are you doing on WSB???? If you want something predictable go open a savings account.
2021-04-16 17:02:27,wallstreetbets,"It was 4 dollars because of it being fucking shat all over by HFs and shit, it was trading at 15+ for years before that. Get your facts straight if you are gonna try and talk shit."
2021-04-16 12:07:19,wallstreetbets,Really took him for a spin there
2021-04-16 12:30:58,wallstreetbets,"Obviously... the fundamental value of GME is pretty clear, there is literally no doubt at all that it’s around 20-30 dollars.

But, when will it get to its fundamental value? Do you have any idea? Cause I definitely don’t. 

GME has been oscillating between 150 and 200 for like 2 months... how do you know it will not keep doing exactly that until people lose interest in maybe half a year? Don’t you understand that Puts have a date and lose value every day due to IV?

Geez, I swear some people here are so dumb lol."
2021-04-16 16:37:42,wallstreetbets,"Well, first of all dude, you can trade in the stock market without being retarded and make money. I usually risk 1-2% each trade, which is what everyone should do. 99% of people here will never get to that point, blowing up their account like almost every new trader does. It’s fine, the circle of life.

As for why I’m in WSB:

1) Some plays are legitimately good, such as GME in December, Tesla last year, and RKT this year to make quick buck. The important thing here is to sell before the DD  posts come, cause then it’s already over (you can usually make money shorting when the DD comes tho). 

2) Entertainment value: people like AnalFarmer, ControlTheNarrative, the Gourd Futures guy, the guy who lost 4 million in XIV... like, this is priceless dude. I admire and enjoy loss porn as much as any other guy here."
2021-04-16 12:33:07,wallstreetbets,Is this sarcasm? 🤣🤣
2021-04-16 12:43:27,wallstreetbets,"Yes, yes they are..."
2021-04-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,20k TSM $150C 1/22 
2021-04-15 23:35:40,wallstreetbets,There’s a big two part article on the diplomat about TSM’s place in a China Taiwan war
2021-04-15 23:39:39,wallstreetbets,"They need to invest billions in new foundry’s at some point the eps line up will come down and chip shortages are good news but at a certain point they will have maxed out sales and expenses will increase

I’m a TSM bull but have made past posts counting to the fact they’ve committed to spending [100 billion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tsmc-to-invest-100-billion-to-increase-semiconductor-output-11617281721) over the next three years on new factories

This expenditure would be more than all but the top 60 countries gdp and could be higher"
2021-04-15 23:14:43,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-16 03:38:22,wallstreetbets,"The primary way TSM increases profits is by increasing expenses, because they are committed to that 50% gross profit margin.  TSM doesn't make generic chips, each chip is designed for client, so they try to maintain long term relationships.  Thus, they don't want to be seen as price gouging - they could be making bank right now, but it would come at the expense of those relationships. That's why inflation, higher cap ex spending, etc., are actually good for TSM, because it justifies price increase with a profit margin attached.

tldr; the more TSM has to spend, the more it makes."
2021-04-16 05:51:04,wallstreetbets,China can say whatever the fuck they want. They won’t dare touch Taiwan
2021-04-16 00:37:29,wallstreetbets,"I love how they’re writing about a past event, as if we’ve stopped trading."
2021-04-16 08:42:35,wallstreetbets,"Either way, this is gonna age like fine wine"
2021-04-16 14:12:52,wallstreetbets,"More like “Wallstreetbets has us bent over like pretzel , fudge dipped w/sprinkle, but we can’t let you; our prized golden goose, true smooth-brained boomers know that”"
2021-04-15 20:41:23,wallstreetbets,Well maybe they shorted GME
2021-04-15 20:39:34,wallstreetbets,Coinbase choose to do a direct placement instead of the traditional IPO. Doesn’t that mean that the banks did not have the chance to buy Coinbase at 250?
2021-04-15 20:46:45,wallstreetbets,Totally possible that’s why is not xxx%+
2021-04-16 00:25:06,wallstreetbets,"This ape Fucks!

Tits: JACKED!

Bought 4k more in after hours today for a total of 10k 

LETS FUCKING GO!"
2021-04-15 20:08:48,wallstreetbets,Man got some balls would had bigger if you jumped in at 40

2021-04-15 20:27:07,wallstreetbets,This... seems sensible...
2021-04-15 22:09:17,wallstreetbets,Did you get screwed on penalties for moving money out of your IRA?
2021-04-15 22:13:25,wallstreetbets,Only 53.16% chubb. Still came but barely.
2021-04-15 22:16:17,wallstreetbets,"Hear,here!"
2021-04-15 22:36:36,wallstreetbets,Bought on vanguard today too oh yeahhhh
2021-04-15 23:23:12,wallstreetbets,"May Science bless you, retard. Good luck! 

Then gtfo RH already"
2021-04-16 00:43:04,wallstreetbets,You cashed out an IRA? Damn. 10% penalty ain’t a thing am I right? LOL
2021-04-16 01:24:12,wallstreetbets,We shouldn’t post positions? When the fuck did that happen????
2021-04-16 01:26:38,wallstreetbets,What if I told you there was no Robbinghood post squeeze?
2021-04-16 01:28:13,wallstreetbets,"10 million floor for me, and i mean FLOOR, not ceiling."
2021-04-16 01:43:53,wallstreetbets,"As someone who had Vanguard, get the fuck out of there if you seriously want to own stocks that you might want to sell. They have one of the most limited stock trading features I've seen. After you submit an order, you cannot change it in anyway until the order expires.

Move to Schwab or IBKR. I've tried a shitload of brokers and those are my favs."
2021-04-16 03:58:30,wallstreetbets,Y'all are still going at it with GME?
2021-04-16 05:49:21,wallstreetbets,You are aninspiration to all aspiring retards
2021-04-16 06:18:58,wallstreetbets,RH is going to fuck you when the squeeze comes
2021-04-16 09:52:49,wallstreetbets,Get out now!!!
2021-04-16 10:26:50,wallstreetbets,I owe you a beer my GME fam
2021-04-16 11:53:19,wallstreetbets,"Lol, love that everyone is literally still on RobinHood after the January fiasco. Seems almost too retarded to be true."
2021-04-15 20:00:08,wallstreetbets,I honestly hope all you retards lose your money and a few go homeless or kill themselves.
2021-04-15 21:49:40,wallstreetbets,Imagine trusting robinhood with nearly $200k
2021-04-15 23:43:41,wallstreetbets,"Don’t you have to pay over 50% taxes and fines when you cash out your Ira? And you’re going to have to pay another 50% in taxes after you cash out. That math doesn’t work out well to me but hey, good luck."
2021-04-16 10:37:44,wallstreetbets,Clover health is over 100% short
2021-04-15 22:23:47,wallstreetbets,They literally just prevented people from selling the dog coin due to “routine maintenance “ now imagine routine maintenance for gme
2021-04-15 20:48:29,wallstreetbets,Yeah it took four trading days for me but when all my shares showed up in my new broker they all had significantly lower averages. Gme for ex I had a 195 avg but when they showed up in td i had the same amount of shares at a $13 avg. wtf is that about??
2021-04-15 22:40:45,wallstreetbets,Kinda like what they’re doing right this second with virtual circular monetary denomination tokens being at a big peak and suddenly their app breaks with “something went wrong”
2021-04-16 11:54:52,wallstreetbets,"I heard they come to take your money, no wonder $GME can't do much, everyone on here is still on RH and we're getting data smacked from the order entries given to Citadel. SMH, you'd think we'd learn from the January debacle. I guess we really are that retarded."
2021-04-16 01:42:54,wallstreetbets,It's a screenshot of their positions?
2021-04-16 04:43:21,wallstreetbets,"With regular stocks you can do whatever you want, but for the highly shorted ones, they'll gather all the data of positions and use it to further manipulate shareholders."

2021-04-15 22:18:09,wallstreetbets,Eh just don't worry about it big man.  We'll tell you later.
2021-04-16 15:06:29,wallstreetbets,They never disallowed selling.
2021-04-16 15:06:10,wallstreetbets,Everyone stayed after the sub swore off RH during the March/2020 fiasco. You're retarded if you thought this would make any difference.
2021-04-15 22:48:04,wallstreetbets,"I mean, it's better to just feel a little bit of cringecompassion, and then buy near-LEAPS puts."
2021-04-16 03:30:21,wallstreetbets,No
2021-04-15 22:02:46,wallstreetbets,Vanguard or F?
2021-04-15 23:42:09,wallstreetbets,Yup about an hour ago.  Seems like they don't have the capital to pay above .25
2021-04-16 02:04:20,wallstreetbets,I drunkenly bought $200 worth of doggy coin last night and forgot about it and opened tonight for a 100% gain and sold. Sometimes I like drunk me....
2021-04-16 06:27:45,wallstreetbets,"Did they do that during open market?  If so, that is real shady.  Maintenance should be done when the market is closed."
2021-04-16 06:28:27,wallstreetbets,"wow, now that is a profit."
2021-04-16 12:10:08,wallstreetbets,"I think people are simply afraid to migrate over to another brokerage, most likely afraid that while they do, they will miss the MOASS.  I can understand that.  But, I think it just needs to be done.  Only takes a couple days, and I don't think anyone will miss it in the meantime.  
I never had an RH account, but after what I've seen, if I did have one, I would definitely move off of them."
2021-04-16 10:53:42,wallstreetbets,"""I know we shouldn't post positions, ..."""
2021-04-15 22:47:41,wallstreetbets,So excess contributions into Robinhood. Then the plan is to roll it back to avoid taxes?
2021-04-15 22:16:24,wallstreetbets,They're being harassed because it motivates the apes.  Fuck them though.  Gme money I've made has upped my arsenal 10 fold.  Got armor plates for the whole family now.
2021-04-16 15:37:35,wallstreetbets,"I might be retarded for thinking other people will swear off RH, but I'm definitely not retarded enough to leave my money in there myself."
2021-04-15 20:12:23,wallstreetbets,Partial transfers should only take 48 hours. Send them an email that you don't need an account sweep since it's only a partial transfer.
2021-04-16 03:06:54,wallstreetbets,RH
2021-04-16 06:32:12,wallstreetbets,Nah it was like 11pm and they were getting overwhelmed with sell orders
2021-04-16 09:08:00,wallstreetbets,Do you suspect that was because TD had to actually buy the shares unlike RH?
2021-04-16 12:13:23,wallstreetbets,"I mean, nothing has really happened in a week, I'lll be willing to bet 1k the MOASS's doesn't happen next week. Just seeing RH screenshots pisses me off.

You're going to leave your money with someone that wouldn't let you do the most VANILLA TRADE EVER, AKA BUY?!

Fuck RH. Personally, never will use it. 

I will give them that their interface is pretty good, as well as their options interface. But after January, they can suck a dead dick.

I use TDA and thinkorswim, what do you use/recommend?"
2021-04-16 14:40:38,wallstreetbets,"Oh wow, missed that in the gore of a post title.

Who the hell would even suggest not posting positions on an anonymous gambling board? I want my wsb from 18 months ago back..... or even 6 months ago..."
2021-04-15 21:30:00,wallstreetbets,I definitely started it as a full account transfer since I haven't been doing anything with crypto and want out
2021-04-16 03:33:47,wallstreetbets,Username checks out
2021-04-16 09:59:46,wallstreetbets,"No idea, not sure if what is happening is even possible."
2021-04-16 12:26:09,wallstreetbets,I use both Etrade and Fidelity.  They been doing this for years.  I highly recommend them.
2021-04-15 20:15:45,wallstreetbets,"Once all your transactions settle, do a partial transfer of only your gme shares. Should only take 24-48 hours."
2021-04-15 22:11:31,wallstreetbets,"Everyone but Fidelity and Vanguard.  


And Fidelity still routes through Citadel Smart Market which then directs even single share buy orders to bulk markets and sell orders to the exchange so the price doesn't go up."
2021-04-16 02:07:48,wallstreetbets,yes lol
2021-04-15 21:34:44,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. You should have just done a partial to get out asap, and then closed the account after."
2021-04-16 14:41:33,wallstreetbets,"Groovy, which one do you prefer and why? Want a new broker for a long account."
2021-04-15 23:02:24,wallstreetbets,"Um, no. Only buying was restricted."
2021-04-15 22:12:20,wallstreetbets,"I read TD uses Apex which clamped down in January too. It's too bad, otherwise I would open a new acct there. Kind of hating on Fidelity since the 50% max on limit orders."
2021-04-16 15:28:47,wallstreetbets,"I like Etrade better.  It's easier to use and has better features.  Etrade's Power Trade is pretty nice.  Fidelity, to me, doesn't have much features compared to what I've seen with Etrade.  Both aren't bad.  But if I was going to use one or the other for day or swing trading, it would be Etrade.  For long term, buy and forget, then Fidelity would suffice, if you have no alternative.  Again, both are good and wouldn't screw over their users, as far as I can tell."
2021-04-16 02:06:53,wallstreetbets,"lol there are no more crazy yolos. Buying 30 shares (not options) of GME 3 months after the first spike isn't a ""yolo"""
2021-04-15 20:24:25,wallstreetbets,"Ah. Ok then. Thanks, I didn’t realize."
2021-04-15 22:09:37,wallstreetbets,"As long as there is a bid to buy, though, which there should be in this case."

2021-04-16 00:41:25,wallstreetbets,"I'd love to get off Robinhood, but with that $75 transfer fee they charge, that's almost a quarter of my investment (Because I'm a tiny ape)"
2021-04-15 21:07:24,wallstreetbets,Haha I bought with all my cash available
2021-04-15 20:50:22,wallstreetbets,Probably input a dollar amount to buy instead of shares
2021-04-15 20:07:57,wallstreetbets,"Yeah,I'd be in for the 10s, but I feel like 15 by May is just ambitious as fuck, especially given all the shenanigans the shorties have demonstrated they are capable of."
2021-04-16 00:38:58,wallstreetbets,"$1,160"
2021-04-15 20:39:57,wallstreetbets,Oh. Yea I agree.  9 bucks for like 6 mozzarella sticks.  I've never bought theater food before tho
2021-04-15 22:16:49,wallstreetbets,It’s the theater’s purest revenue
2021-04-15 23:48:53,wallstreetbets,Fuck the big 4 slave shops

2021-04-16 06:42:21,wallstreetbets,"Shit, why didn’t you say EY had the keys to unlock the power of 5G. That’s one tasty Kahuna burger there Brad. Why don’t you share with everyone else?

But rather, consultants are the leeches of the business world. EY will milk Nokia for a few years for little to no value imho."
2021-04-16 07:43:07,wallstreetbets,You mean the Ernst and Young that accredited Wirecards balance sheet?
2021-04-16 15:09:57,wallstreetbets,"I haven't worked as a real consultant, but have worked on contract for projects which would need to be finished. The previous guy was just fucking around and extending his time or something by not finishing his work. I came and finished it in one month (it was plain excel work) and told the manager that the work was done. He was very confused and didn't expect it to be finished that quick. I have experienced that multiple times. Most people are indeed there for keeping the project going on for very long (for their own benefit and for the benefit of the corporation they work for)."
2021-04-16 00:50:38,wallstreetbets,When does it end let’s short some stock.
2021-04-16 08:29:08,wallstreetbets,"I know, but regarding their foresight and future planning capabilities, I thought the brand story was worse ;)"
2021-04-15 22:58:23,wallstreetbets,Distribution of accountability is key to a long and happy life as a manager/puppet.
2021-04-15 20:53:21,wallstreetbets,This was worse option call I’ve ever seen logic wise
2021-04-15 21:56:39,wallstreetbets,!remindme 11 Hours

2021-04-16 01:20:20,wallstreetbets,Sir could've bought shares but respect for your big balls
2021-04-16 02:39:15,wallstreetbets,"Godspeed my fellow ape. Common shares don't have as much upside, but don't expire worthless. I'm rooting for you though."
2021-04-16 15:39:20,wallstreetbets,Ripppop lol u got 10 mins

2021-04-15 22:54:59,wallstreetbets,"I understand. I've been there mentally before due to the grim future we were marching towards. There's always another day - GME and the impending crash actually give me a bit of hope here, lol. I know some people on reddit can help - reach out to them"
2021-04-15 23:06:55,wallstreetbets,Never ever make permanent decisions about temporary situations
2021-04-15 22:14:35,wallstreetbets,"This is a casino bro, stop scaring the guests"
2021-04-15 21:44:17,wallstreetbets,imagine thinking anyone else here was really interested in making YOU money
2021-04-16 01:30:39,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, tends to help the bid price if buyers have any reason at all to believes there's a chance of it landing ITM. Crazy, I know."
2021-04-16 01:32:11,wallstreetbets,Phone is kinda charged...sus
2021-04-16 01:35:16,wallstreetbets,"They stopped using JNJ because the risk was a little higher than the others so it would be unethical to continue with JNJ knowing it was less safe. They don't even know if the blood clots are from the vaccine. I got the Pfizer, but if I was offered JNJ I would not hesitate to get it. Already have autism either way/s"
2021-04-15 20:05:47,wallstreetbets,I think his mom got plowed up the ass by her boyfriend at 0:30
2021-04-15 20:41:09,wallstreetbets,Yay! I was a bit sad I couldn't buy puts on COIN but now I'll just buy more puts on Cathie Wood's ETFs cause they're eventually gonna implode and I'll get short exposure to all the other illiquid crap she has in those funds.
2021-04-16 00:09:52,wallstreetbets,Why do all these finance shows employ hot asian chicks? I never see them on tv anywhere else.
2021-04-16 10:46:09,wallstreetbets,"This bald weirdo gets congratulated, and dfv gets investigated by the sec.... Hmmmm"
2021-04-15 22:57:41,wallstreetbets,"Look at the fundamental dishonesty of the American financial medias...

As everytime I see the stock hit that level 

I see a big buy order from them at there 7:30 reports"
2021-04-15 23:01:21,wallstreetbets,More accurate question: Do you think she cares you're happy?
2021-04-15 23:02:15,wallstreetbets,*Thinking that she bought at the price on the screen instead of realizing it's the actual price at the time of broadcast....*
2021-04-15 21:32:48,wallstreetbets,Shits manipulated to the tits
2021-04-15 20:28:57,wallstreetbets,Was confused by this statement too.
2021-04-16 05:42:27,wallstreetbets,Ol Varn brings up bernie sanders every chance he gets. He's obsessed with the guy.
2021-04-15 20:28:09,wallstreetbets,Your assets?
2021-04-15 23:02:12,wallstreetbets,Of course not ! But Dad needs his 🐔🍗
2021-04-15 23:04:23,wallstreetbets,"always was. 

You just need to make sure you rub elbow with the right side instead of rubbing elbow with the fair side."
2021-04-15 20:32:35,wallstreetbets,"Yep, all 2 in- I mean 2 million 😬"
2021-04-16 07:50:55,wallstreetbets,"I recently realized my corn plays were based on the dollar amount I wanted to end up with, rather than how much money I was dumping in compared to stonks. I have since upped my anny in my favorite corn. If I invest fractions into corn compared to stonks and notes I hate money."
2021-04-16 00:31:17,wallstreetbets,100%
2021-04-15 22:58:32,wallstreetbets,Take any article you read with a grain of salt. Only pay attention to FACTS.
2021-04-16 15:09:44,wallstreetbets,"Added more and up to 100 shares.
Now just have to wait for a couple years."
2021-04-15 23:26:10,wallstreetbets,NIO gang
2021-04-16 00:21:58,wallstreetbets,Do people do SPY leaps?
2021-04-16 00:43:02,wallstreetbets,That means you sell
2021-04-16 00:43:13,wallstreetbets,That means you sell
2021-04-16 00:42:42,wallstreetbets,You belong here
2021-04-16 01:37:27,wallstreetbets,It's on sale
2021-04-15 20:07:18,wallstreetbets,"You can check out any time you like, But you can never leave"
2021-04-16 02:56:00,wallstreetbets,I only ever listen to the Motley Fool. Their top 5 stocks to make your portfolio 10x are always guaranteed plays. /s
2021-04-16 00:42:24,wallstreetbets,The economist is pretty good. Subscription isn't that expensive.
2021-04-16 07:36:19,wallstreetbets,You can rent a boat or go on a cruise
2021-04-16 07:48:10,wallstreetbets,Funny you say this. Texas you goto the bar at AMC before and after the movie
2021-04-16 02:26:01,wallstreetbets,"Wait, what? You've countered his actual logic with terrible analogies. The experience of blockbuster is not why you went to blockbuster. You went to get a tape you could watch at home. Netflix made that step unnecessary to stream the same experience.

That is not the same as why you go to a movie theatre. You go there to have the big screen and sound and some popcorn and so you don't have to make awkward conversation with your date and can just skip to the whole hand on thigh dance & making out while both pretending you had a proper date and didn't text ""netflix & chill?""

The experience of film photography (while still not dead, btw) is similarly a ln inconvenient middle step to reach a similar outcome/experience of final photos. Developing film was a labor of love, but not the reason you took up photography. People love the prints, not the negatives. 

You can have VR sex now, but it doesn't mean tinder is going away."
2021-04-16 02:34:53,wallstreetbets,"Lol. Fast food offers the best value experience. They engineer that shit to fire off people's pleasure centers like crack cocaine. But restaurants still do trillions of dollars in revenue, vs some tiny amount spent on hello fresh. You're completely wrong. Restaurants, like bars, theaters, concert venues thrive because people are social. They're struggling now because they're closed because beyond social during a pandemic doesn't work. But they will all be overwhelmed with demand in 6-9 months. Is bet my life savings on that. I don't know enough about AMC's books specifically to know whether that growth is priced in (I expect so, given the massive speculation on the artificial squeeze) so I'm not buying that stock right now - not sure how price will react. But I know their top line revenue is going to look real real good in their earnings release for the 1st & 2nd quarter of 2022."
2021-04-16 03:39:37,wallstreetbets,There are some absolute crayon munchers aboot here
2021-04-16 03:07:30,wallstreetbets,Hopefully you read something dumber at some point so this was only like the 2nd or 3rd dumbest
2021-04-16 03:07:01,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the correct answer I was doing that thing where I said something really stupid in the hopes that someone would give me the correct answer I will not be answering any follow-up questions about this brilliant plan though
2021-04-16 02:15:23,wallstreetbets,"This is how my mother thinks stocks work, no matter how many times I try to explain."
2021-04-16 03:06:14,wallstreetbets,Yes because I am stupid
2021-04-15 20:50:16,wallstreetbets,I’m dying 💀

2021-04-16 15:28:37,wallstreetbets,Die-versify
2021-04-15 22:21:56,wallstreetbets,Ignore the haters OP. Smart play in my mind. Watching it for 3 months and 11 is about the floor. It will bounce back to 18-19 as it has a few times now.
2021-04-15 20:52:06,wallstreetbets,Dude. Sell 960 covered calls for the May21 $20 Call. Pocket 91k instantly and if it hits great you doubled your investment. 🚀🚀🚀

2021-04-16 02:28:30,wallstreetbets,Is it still a yolo when you make a new bet with the same million every other week??  And erase the previous weeks yolo??
2021-04-16 12:13:03,wallstreetbets,Can this be squeezed or what?
2021-04-16 00:12:32,wallstreetbets,Here I am just hoping it props up MOON a bit
2021-04-16 00:13:19,wallstreetbets,"Jesus, I’d just suedo retire on that"

2021-04-16 12:19:52,wallstreetbets,"hey man, you’re back. thought you were gna take a longer break! saw you thought the bubble was gna pop n everything was gng downhill for awhile"
2021-04-15 20:22:30,wallstreetbets,"Ok, I don’t normally do this — if I make this pig wear lipstick tomorrow and you’re up 100k, can you maybe throw some crumbs my way... 10k would keep me from having to start an onlyfans."

2021-04-16 09:28:56,wallstreetbets,You have $1M in RH? This screenshot is fake. Who with that money has it in RH...
2021-04-16 04:44:20,wallstreetbets,So is the flex that you had a million to buy this crap position or that you had to spend a million to make three grand?
2021-04-15 20:05:59,wallstreetbets,Just saying if you ever wanna just give me a dollar im here.😂 Kidding of course.

2021-04-15 20:07:19,wallstreetbets,Only a true retard has over 1 million in robinhood
2021-04-15 20:10:57,wallstreetbets,"There is retard, and there is full blown microcephaly, you are flirting with the line."

2021-04-15 20:17:52,wallstreetbets,His yolo is my confirmation bias
2021-04-15 23:59:49,wallstreetbets,MVIS is sitting at a support level. i think he's just gambling it will see a pop. not that complicated.
2021-04-15 20:10:23,wallstreetbets,They've been talking about a buy out for a decade.
2021-04-15 20:25:16,wallstreetbets,Throwing a million dollars at a stock regardless of whether it's stock or options.... seems like a decent yolo to me.
2021-04-15 20:29:04,wallstreetbets,My first thought was that this isn’t a yolo

2021-04-15 23:25:45,wallstreetbets,What's it say?
2021-04-15 23:16:44,wallstreetbets,Me too we have three generations in it!
2021-04-15 22:39:00,wallstreetbets,why was this so cheap and suddenly not
2021-04-16 09:07:04,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-16 00:03:59,wallstreetbets,It's holding?
2021-04-16 09:29:58,wallstreetbets,"Maybe he just likes to experience being up or down tens of thousands of dollars every few minutes, since MVIS trades like a fucking penny stock"
2021-04-16 09:33:49,wallstreetbets,Way she goes
2021-04-16 11:00:53,wallstreetbets,Sold McDonalds
2021-04-15 21:56:32,wallstreetbets,Three ways
2021-04-16 13:53:04,wallstreetbets,I asked about the squeeze on mvis and got downvoted to oblivion.
2021-04-15 23:59:29,wallstreetbets,Or he sold out of the position immediately after this screenshot.
2021-04-15 20:11:27,wallstreetbets,I think the lesson here is take gains after a pop. Don't be afraid of short term capital gains and buy back later if you really believe in the company.
2021-04-15 23:12:40,wallstreetbets,"It’s kind of subjective, if the dude put his life savings on it, that’s a yolo. If he put in a milli out of his 5 billion, that’s nothing."
2021-04-15 23:15:23,wallstreetbets,Its a hard yolo.
2021-04-16 19:38:47,wallstreetbets,"Hey new guy here, of MVIS is a buyout candidate. Doesn't that mean who ever buys it, wants to buy it at lowest share price? In that case, what's the spike gonna be? Maybe x3 ?"
2021-04-16 12:45:20,wallstreetbets,Didn’t they Just open a customer service line?
2021-04-16 13:14:42,wallstreetbets,"Go to a different brokerage and then play the options game. Watch how much money you save not having to shop around your options at different prices. I like Robinhood, but it's absolutely dogshit for any options purchases and sales."
2021-04-15 23:14:43,wallstreetbets,"All in on MVIS also, except for a lone share of GME"
2021-04-16 01:24:05,wallstreetbets,To make it more worse I did same thing on another one.  This is why i now don't sell the penntstocks I'm in.   The rh pennystock sub has people that do great DD and helped me get in them early. I now own thousands of shares in a few pennystocks and never selling until the end.
2021-04-16 01:33:56,wallstreetbets,"On the plus side I made an extra $2,200 from MVIS.  But got out when my $7k became $9k and wish I stayed in."
2021-04-16 02:01:24,wallstreetbets,Watch the movie called Owning Mahoney..  based on a true story..  there is never enough to win for a degenerate gambler..
2021-04-16 11:13:15,wallstreetbets,but wouldn't be better to just post your EOD YOLO to the world?
2021-04-16 09:31:50,wallstreetbets,this is the wsb way
2021-04-16 11:00:06,wallstreetbets,What makes you think this??
2021-04-15 23:46:48,wallstreetbets,CEO basically making sure he keeps his base salary and all shares when there is a “change of control” aka buyout
2021-04-16 01:25:30,wallstreetbets,He will be getting 300k shares every year for next 3 yrs
2021-04-15 23:17:19,wallstreetbets,Their technology is incredible!
2021-04-16 09:33:29,wallstreetbets,Way she goes
2021-04-16 00:42:00,wallstreetbets,"it hit 10.49 sir, breaking through 11.5.."
2021-04-16 10:55:56,wallstreetbets,To the moon
2021-04-16 11:11:28,wallstreetbets,Shares or an actual franchise
2021-04-15 21:34:03,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip retard
2021-04-16 08:45:09,wallstreetbets,I like three ways
2021-04-15 22:53:49,wallstreetbets,Four ways
2021-04-15 20:41:13,wallstreetbets,https://imgur.com/rfk7jgc.jpg is mine?
2021-04-15 22:38:51,wallstreetbets,Its pretty easy to inspect element
2021-04-16 00:18:40,wallstreetbets,You can tell by the way they is
2021-04-15 20:36:34,wallstreetbets,Pretty much what I did. In at .80 out at 22 back in today
2021-04-16 00:37:44,wallstreetbets,taxes hurt too much......
2021-04-15 20:17:31,wallstreetbets,"Yeah just like PLTR will be back to $45 soon, NIO will explode through that puny $65 resistance, AMC will go to $20 because they’ll wait a couple of months before they dump another 500M shares on naive investors (this one takes the cake) and SPACs will resume rallying 100% on rumors."
2021-04-16 13:59:39,wallstreetbets,Only 25?
2021-04-16 10:13:21,wallstreetbets,Also depends which stock.. 1 mil in MSFT isn't the same as 1 mil in MVIS by several orders of YOLO
2021-04-15 20:13:23,wallstreetbets,SAY MY NAME
2021-04-15 20:12:02,wallstreetbets,Didnt this go from a penny stock up to 11 already this year?
2021-04-16 02:59:26,wallstreetbets,Hope one explodes dude
2021-04-15 23:19:39,wallstreetbets,"Good luck, I am buying more tomorrow too. I don’t always wait for the dip because I really just want the shares. Today I bought several times because it kept dropping I found more money to thrown in"
2021-04-16 11:11:45,wallstreetbets,Nuggets
2021-04-15 21:16:07,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-04-16 05:49:52,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip till you own all the stock then you set the price. GG Ez trillionaire
2021-04-15 21:55:16,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-16 07:07:58,wallstreetbets,He has no money left to buy the dip 🤔
2021-04-16 15:23:40,wallstreetbets,So do your wife's two boyfriends
2021-04-16 08:29:35,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-16 04:41:15,wallstreetbets,Five ways?
2021-04-15 20:52:54,wallstreetbets,I hope so
2021-04-15 22:00:53,wallstreetbets,Yes you can literally paper trade on webull and you’ve cropped the picture.
2021-04-16 08:02:21,wallstreetbets,Based retard
2021-04-16 03:47:34,wallstreetbets,"it's better to make gains and pay the taxes than straight up taking losses; nobody ever went broke taking gains, even after taxes"
2021-04-15 22:04:20,wallstreetbets,I think you just attacked everyone that joined WSB in the past 6 months. good show
2021-04-15 22:27:36,wallstreetbets,AMC isn't using new shares in 2021
2021-04-16 08:46:44,wallstreetbets,I'll take all of the above please and thank you.
2021-04-15 20:37:04,wallstreetbets,Bigdawgruffruff...
2021-04-15 21:10:28,wallstreetbets,"Vlad is still absolutely retarded for lying about their liquidity problems on TV. He could've just come out and said, ""We had issues due to the margin requirement being increased for these stocks"" but instead he just evaporated any credibility he may have had for whatever reason (IPO or some other reason)."
2021-04-15 21:08:16,wallstreetbets,Money up front. Don’t ever front that shit
2021-04-15 23:10:36,wallstreetbets,"Kills me. In November my stock group did a competition, no real stakes other than bragging rights. I picked MVIS. I had 200+ shares at like 1 something. Sold that initial spike and made some money. MAVIS Made me rethink my strategy that I should always make my money back with some profit and keep some shares for the what if factor."
2021-04-15 20:45:47,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, I will be looking more into it?"
2021-04-15 20:45:26,wallstreetbets,Sweet Thanks. I will be looking more into it for sure.
2021-04-15 23:40:12,wallstreetbets,Noice! Get ready for the long haul then. EZ 100bagger
2021-04-15 23:41:38,wallstreetbets,Just like a ton of other stocks out there. Some of them have even dropped 50%-75%

2021-04-16 00:22:29,wallstreetbets,$Ç∅ЯÑ gang finally getting the respect we deserve
2021-04-15 23:18:03,wallstreetbets,Notice how he left out GME
2021-04-16 06:15:37,wallstreetbets,And webull...and....who else did the exact same shit that NOBODY mentions?  Only difference was RH CEO forgot the rule to just keep your mouth shut and stay low.
2021-04-16 12:09:30,wallstreetbets,"No hes not. You never say that as a bank or financial firm. 

Thats business 101"
2021-04-16 12:10:54,wallstreetbets,Before these rules existed stock trading was riskier because one party could just put up their middle finger and default on the other and not deliver shares or payment.
2021-04-16 00:07:42,wallstreetbets,"always buy, never sell."
2021-04-16 02:07:28,wallstreetbets,Yea no shit man. You don't want to be investing into stocks like that during the biggest bull market of all time eh??????
2021-04-15 21:19:53,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-04-16 14:36:34,wallstreetbets,Segways?
2021-04-15 23:24:14,wallstreetbets,oh I noticed. but I didn't feel it was worth the effort.
2021-04-15 20:09:46,wallstreetbets,its got wicked high short interest for some reason
2021-04-15 20:59:00,wallstreetbets,Short volume is through the roof. Shorts are all in and there’s nothing left for them to borrow. This will for sure squeeze soon
2021-04-16 13:51:02,wallstreetbets,"Except users were still able to buy GME on brokers like Schwab, they just had to be purchased with cleared funds."
2021-04-16 07:51:39,wallstreetbets,"Over 50% of Robinhood users had GME according to some of the stuff going around at the time. Robinhood was the largest of the startup brokerages. None of the other minor brokerages like WeBull really mattered.   


Stopping the short squeeze on Melvin gave them an exit strategy to finish unwinding, assuming their mass exit on Wednesday hadn't been it. Any other shorts caught in the same movement had an exit path as well."
2021-04-16 12:14:20,wallstreetbets,The part that I don't understand is why brokers have to use their own money (and not the money of the customer who is buying) as collateral.
2021-04-15 22:21:47,wallstreetbets,When is your call expiry?
2021-04-15 21:12:33,wallstreetbets,"Duh Both can happen. Lol. I’m bullish AF on this tech, I know it will change the world so I’m A long either way. A lidar announcement/ partnership can be announced anytime causing the shorts to cover in a frenzy causing a squeeze, or like a a lot of the signs point to, we can be acquired any anytime as well"

2021-04-16 00:46:01,wallstreetbets,They’re suicidal idiots for turning on Robinhood who revolutionized the game and is being used as a proxy to fuck retail. But my conspiracy hat says it was a forced liquidity crisis because the Ls in the billions were going to run all the way down the pipeline.
2021-04-16 12:16:27,wallstreetbets,Prob cause some retail and a lot of institutional purchases  are done on margin and/or it takes time for the money to move from a persons account so the broker has to put the money up in the moment
2021-04-15 22:23:24,wallstreetbets,"Majority 7/16

Edit: I had a few 2022 leaps but thought I would be better off leveraging more medium term"
2021-04-16 01:17:14,wallstreetbets,That's not even a conspiracy.    The clearing houses require collateral in order to protect themselves.
2021-04-16 12:18:44,wallstreetbets,"I understand that in those cases it would have to be broker money.  But even in cases where the customer has the money on deposit, the broker still needs to use their own funds, and I don't understand the purpose of that.

If it wasn't for that rule, brokers would most likely not have been forced to suspend buying."
2021-04-15 22:33:03,wallstreetbets,Cheers!
2021-04-16 01:27:10,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I know, I said pipeline for a reason. The conspiracy is I think the banks brought out their baseball bats to stop the first domino."
2021-04-16 12:39:54,wallstreetbets,"The cost of the stock is changing as people buy and sell. If the broker wasn’t putting up their own guaranteed money stocks couldn’t be traded instantly every second with the price going up and down. 

Someone has to be on the hook in the moment and guarantee the money"
2021-04-15 20:08:14,wallstreetbets,it is about to fly 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-04-15 22:46:18,wallstreetbets,Nope. I sold 1/2 at 36 still holding ave $20
2021-04-16 13:09:51,wallstreetbets,"Nah, the dividends gotta come down or the price has gotta go up. Very bullish"
2021-04-16 17:18:05,wallstreetbets,I'm still with ya although much less shares and a little higher cost
2021-04-16 01:26:47,wallstreetbets,Oh fuck are you serious. Do you think your future plans to move your truck loan over to rocket are priced into the market already? Do you think doing so could potentially be a catalyst for a squeeze situation?
2021-04-15 22:41:34,wallstreetbets,That they do 🤝 fellow Michigander here holding shares with you longterm
2021-04-15 20:30:34,wallstreetbets,Got an average of 25.97 🤦🏽 here for the long haul! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-04-16 14:00:13,wallstreetbets,"Wildly undervalued is an understatement, I can't even fathom to state it correctly... 13 PE in this market is absolutely wild.

I'm only at 120 shares but I keep adding all I can."
2021-04-16 07:27:04,wallstreetbets,no just like the company and switching banks too. I plan to do it all on my cell phone a digital wallet (fintech). traditional banks charge you over draft fees and non sufficient funds fees. Banks also give you what interest? to keep your money in there .05%. Why should I keep money in there at that interest rate its a joke. And I'll have better access to crypto.
2021-04-16 08:51:23,wallstreetbets,And cleveland.

2021-04-16 05:12:21,wallstreetbets,That would be massive
2021-04-15 21:23:58,wallstreetbets,Is this because I gave a middle finger to u/dan_inkuwait ?

2021-04-15 21:59:00,wallstreetbets,It’s pretty much the biggest story of the day. I sold some dumpster fires I bought in November. And a dog helped me get it back in one day...and still going.
2021-04-16 01:34:38,wallstreetbets,"I think it was more the shock of the finger without 1) giving me a little warning and 2) not spitting on it first.

It was just a sudden surprise.  Sorry I reacted harshly."

2021-04-16 09:07:36,wallstreetbets,Now they are reporting we banned talking about it. 🤣

2021-04-16 10:32:33,wallstreetbets,"So to recap, you are re-banning crypto because you don't want to give the impression you are bowing to crypto, but on the other hand you are bowing to bloomberg by re-banning crypto because they said you were bowing to crypto by banning crypto in the first place?

2021-04-16 00:15:28,wallstreetbets,Wall Street is investing in Crypto but we are not allowed to talk about that here?  Makes so much sense.
2021-04-16 01:04:07,wallstreetbets,Literally couldn’t sleep and came looking for the crypto thread to find this. Smfh. Make it make sense.
2021-04-16 01:21:24,wallstreetbets,Imagine how rich all of the apes would be if DD was allowed to be posted about Slim Jim's social media page being filled with a certain dog. Maybe that would have curbed the GME enthusiasm.
2021-04-16 02:07:16,wallstreetbets,I thought this group was about making money not politics?
2021-04-16 04:12:47,wallstreetbets,"Wow, so apparently the media controls WSB then"
2021-04-16 04:17:33,wallstreetbets,Nice fake reason.
2021-04-16 05:29:22,wallstreetbets,Is it WallStreetBets or WallStreetBootlickers? Looooooooool
2021-04-16 05:54:33,wallstreetbets,Gay mods. 🌈 doing gay mod things.
2021-04-16 06:08:37,wallstreetbets,this is the dumbest fucking reason i've ever seen
2021-04-16 06:17:34,wallstreetbets,Wahhh crypto wahhh. How dare someone acquire tendies outside of the rigged stock market. 🙄
2021-04-16 06:51:01,wallstreetbets,"So you don’t bow to crypto, just Bloomberg “journalists”?"
2021-04-16 06:56:05,wallstreetbets,You are now a laughing stock.
2021-04-16 07:22:30,wallstreetbets,Petty move
2021-04-16 07:42:26,wallstreetbets,Cringe mods.
2021-04-16 07:53:32,wallstreetbets,So now you bow to Bloomberg? Smh
2021-04-16 08:29:52,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, reddit mods bow down to bloomberg."
2021-04-16 08:56:24,wallstreetbets,"The Bloomberg Way: get people to spend thousands to make thousands and post their gains/loss porn for them. 

Honestly...game recognise game 👏🏼👏🏼"
2021-04-16 09:15:59,wallstreetbets,This move reminds me of robinhood removing GME stock from their app.
2021-04-16 09:22:35,wallstreetbets,So much fragility in this sub. You guys really care about what Bloomberg said? Who gives a fuck?
2021-04-16 10:00:21,wallstreetbets,"This sub is hot garbage, even the memes are shit tier"
2021-04-16 10:29:23,wallstreetbets,They did that on purpose to keep wsb from driving crypto prices like they do stocks. Rather than bowing to crypto you bowed to bloomberg.
2021-04-16 10:29:36,wallstreetbets,"Hedge Funds Hail Mary after seeing how easily-influenced the mods are:

“WallStreeBets bows to $GME”"

2021-04-16 11:23:25,wallstreetbets,Mods might be the biggest retards on the sub. Letting WSJ bait then into reversing themselves in the span of a day.
2021-04-16 11:57:57,wallstreetbets,I think it's funny that youre bowing to bloomberg instead 😩 actually u downright sucking em off
2021-04-16 12:03:14,wallstreetbets,"This won't age well.

""WSB bows to crypto.. again"""
2021-04-16 12:59:48,wallstreetbets,You're a joke
2021-04-16 13:03:19,wallstreetbets,Crypto is banned due to mods having their fragile egos hurt?
2021-04-16 14:09:00,wallstreetbets,"Same, I've read some stuff. Kinda has me wondering about historical news lately. We, all in it right now, but if you read mainstream media they are doing their best to make it look like it happened months ago and is now done, we're greedy, and all of these other nasty things. My trust of mainstream media has sadly plummeted by a lot since all this started."
2021-04-16 18:22:31,wallstreetbets,"“WallStreetBets bows to boomer media”

Dumbass."
2021-04-15 20:11:32,wallstreetbets,We like the coins 🪙
2021-04-15 20:39:23,wallstreetbets,"Lol this is pathetic. Mods should have seen this type of news coming when they allowed crypt, why get their ego hurt over this.it was a good change. This is an risky investment sub and crypt fits nicely into it."
2021-04-15 23:05:37,wallstreetbets,This sub is becoming what it sought out to destroy
2021-04-16 06:39:26,wallstreetbets,Wow this is an embarrassment. Fastest paper hands in the west. The article didn’t say anything remotely negative. Was just stating the facts.
2021-04-15 20:20:43,wallstreetbets,Mods being soft. Who cares what they think of us?
2021-04-15 20:22:16,wallstreetbets,Pathetic
2021-04-15 20:25:58,wallstreetbets,Moronic
2021-04-15 21:07:15,wallstreetbets,"So all it takes is one Bloomberg article and you knuckle-draggers change your entire course of action? One article stops you from making the greatest decision of your crayon-eating lives? Ya'll probably didn't even read the article because you can't read. Anyway, bad decision made by some helmet-wearing apes. You should be trying to piss the boomers off at every opportunity and getting involved in crypto would be a great way to do it. I'm not saying stop losing your husband-in-law's money on GME but the \~10 million people in here could be making huge waves in the crypto space due to how new and uncharted the territory is.   


I know that was a lot of words so  
TLDR: NO CRYPTO = BAD // CRYPTO = EASY MONEY  


I know it hurts, truly, I do. But for the love of God, THINK!"
2021-04-15 22:54:38,wallstreetbets,Why is anyone still reading bloomberg?
2021-04-16 00:58:42,wallstreetbets,Sounds like mods are mad that a certain dog coin outgained their GME portfolio.
2021-04-16 01:06:37,wallstreetbets,And why should we care about what a Bloomberg article says about us?
2021-04-16 06:39:01,wallstreetbets,What are we going to do next? Ban discussions about GME and Roaring Kitty because CNBC tells us we worship them?
2021-04-16 08:04:40,wallstreetbets,"""Wallstreetbets mods let ridiculous click bait articles affect what people are allowed to talk about."""
2021-04-16 08:50:55,wallstreetbets,"Are we that easily manipulated?

2021-04-16 08:52:57,wallstreetbets,But wsb is tweeting about the Shiba coin.. shameless
2021-04-16 11:29:09,wallstreetbets,are you FUCKING SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?????  An article is dictating policy here?
2021-04-16 13:33:14,wallstreetbets,"As a subreddit that talks so much about boomers stuck in their old ways, unable to adapt to changing times and investment strategies this seems extremely hypocritical. 

I thought the whole spirit of WSB was fuck the media, fuck the suits, retards do as they please. This exudes extreme levels of beta energy."
2021-04-15 20:03:53,wallstreetbets,Is this the real paper trading competition
2021-04-15 20:11:25,wallstreetbets,This didn’t last as long as the time my wife’s boyfriend was in the room with an escort that I had paid for

2021-04-15 21:55:25,wallstreetbets,Is it r/WallStreetBets? 👀
2021-04-15 22:01:29,wallstreetbets,"Wow, one person gets to decide this?"
2021-04-15 22:10:33,wallstreetbets,"Really, nothing bad about the sub was said in the article.

2021-04-16 00:37:40,wallstreetbets,Maybe this was paper trading v4.20
2021-04-16 00:41:47,wallstreetbets,So we bowing to Bloomberg now? This is weak Bois!

2021-04-15 21:07:16,wallstreetbets,Im honestly happy about this. If you aren't going to let all crypto discussion in then it shouldn't be allowed at all. You cant just choose the picks you own and discard the rest.
2021-04-15 22:29:34,wallstreetbets,Understandable.

2021-04-15 22:57:53,wallstreetbets,how? it was already banned. the fact that >95% of you plebs only showed up during the GME bullshit just means the rules have to be reiterated.
2021-04-16 09:31:59,wallstreetbets,What about letting the sub take a massive vote on what should be allowed to be discussed instead of a 5 year old ?
2021-04-16 14:02:49,wallstreetbets,I mean with the demise of the gme thread as of tomorrow it seems like it's going to become a common theme. Wonder how much money the mods have taken.

2021-04-15 21:03:16,wallstreetbets,I’m relatively new here but I am enjoying making money off crypto. My question is why doesn’t anyone want to have a thread to discuss crypto on?
2021-04-16 08:08:50,wallstreetbets,It had its own daily discussion thread for like 8 hours then this guy pulled the plug over a Bloomberg article

No gatekeeping, everyone can invest early at rock bottom prices in companies/projects they believe in (no stupid VC laws etc.). It doesn't close so you don't get gapped on by institutions who dump it pre-open etc. It's just so much better. I'm probably gonna get out of stocks entirely."

2021-04-15 21:18:41,wallstreetbets,Even in a single thread? Lol.
2021-04-15 20:45:53,wallstreetbets,So all these reasons did not exist yesterday? Why even pretend to allow it in the first place?

2021-04-15 20:57:58,wallstreetbets,Yeah crypto might just be the future of investing. I can tell you it has done wonders for me while the stock market has only fucked me. It would definitely make sense to at least be able to discuss it here.

2021-04-15 22:16:22,wallstreetbets,"AMC has a band of idiots willing to throw their life savings at them on a whimsical dream. AMC is a dying company, they are absolutely going to abuse this reality to put billions of dollars into their pockets. They don’t need a short squeeze to get rich, they just need you and they already have you. The short squeeze narrative flies out of the window if AMC issues 500M new shares, if they didn’t want to do it they wouldn’t be having this vote."
2021-04-16 00:50:32,wallstreetbets,"basically:

'If anything happens and we need more money we will issue more shares, but if nothing happens we won't. Pinky promise.'

I'm surprised they didn't start the statement with 'When we were young boys in Bulgaria..'

&#x200B;

Does it say anywhere in the filing/statement what's the penalty for the exec team should they go ahead and issue new shares out of that 500m in contravention to their promise? No? You don't say!"
2021-04-16 03:11:08,wallstreetbets,"I don’t see why people were hype parroting he doesn’t want to sell them. If they didn’t plan to, they wouldn’t be voting to authorize more then would they. 

Common sense if it was so safe this wouldn’t have become a vote because it wouldn’t be necessary. Him saying we won’t unless it ticks one of these boxes, to me says; we need to and we’ll make it seem like we have no choice when we do. 

Just sounds like a fake gesture for faith and save face. Staying away from this one."
2021-04-16 11:24:58,wallstreetbets,"> Let me unpack this for you. **AMC is saying that if any of the bad things they listed in the statement happen they will not hesitate one moment to issue more shares.**. Theater openings delayed? More shares. AMC can’t pay its interest and debt on schedule? More shares. Motion pictures companies don’t want to screen their movies at theaters for months and go to their own digital platform after two weeks? You got it, more shares. 

You mean to tell me that what AMC intends to do is what most western govt, US in lead, have been doing with their currency for the past year !!!?

Don't those movie theater people have better examples to follow?

&#x200B;

But seriously, yeh, I wouldn't trust anything coming from the mouth of any of those boys regarding further dilution. If they think they need it, it will happen."
2021-04-15 20:00:11,wallstreetbets,"AMC owes back child support?

More shares."
2021-04-15 20:25:56,wallstreetbets,Lol. Still voted no. AMC community says no too. Issue 500 mil next year
2021-04-15 22:11:35,wallstreetbets,They will kill their company the second they issue those shares.
2021-04-16 09:40:07,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like they just covering their ass in case they actually do need to raise money from an unforeseen event.
Im not fluent in legalese but that seems like a generic statement youd put just in case."
2021-04-16 01:36:04,wallstreetbets,"Not just that, but one of the reasons why they are trying to sell this so hard and ""promise"" is because they still have 43k shares in their treasury. They didn't say anything about not selling those. They last time GME squeezed, they fucked everyone when they sold when it was about to hit $20 and left many bag holders when all the dust settled. There were many upset people every platform I went to. People were talking about this. Ask yourself. Why are they so bullish on getting a yes, when they can just put in the request for the shares next year again? I suspect I know the answer to that. It's because they know that they are going to sell those 43k shares and they know that many people will be upset when they do. So, they want to get as many shares approved as possible so they have them for years to come and they don't have to worry about getting a no from the people they screw over, possibly screwed over twice in a row. Imagine how hard and how many years it would take to get something like that approved if they did the same thing they did this past jan? Chances are that they know it would be very difficult to get the approval. So, it's a brilliant plan on their part. Get the yes, put it through and they can sell those 43k shares wrecklessly whenever any type of little squeeze or run up happens. I hope that they would at least be sensible enough to do it when the squeeze is in full effect and at it potential peak or close to it. But, you never know. That's my theory anyways."
2021-04-15 22:29:00,wallstreetbets,"Theres no squeeze. You idiots who think you're gonna squeeze a ticker with 500M shares with like 20% of the shares shorted... Why? Seriously, why and HOW do you think you can cause a short squeeze? Is there a company that's going to buy up 99% of the shares that a select few of you know about but the rest of us dont? 

I've been here for a long time, and one day we were talking about gamestop short squeeze, BECAUSE of 140% of the shares being shorted, then the next day, this sub is inundated with hundreds of posts of RKT and AMC ~also~having a short squeeze, eventhough nothing has ever indicated that anywhere near even 50% of shares were shorted."
2021-04-16 01:38:52,wallstreetbets,"I mean there are going to be many people that will sell when the squeeze happen and plan on buying shares back when it bottoms out again. Just like many did with GME. So, if you really were worried about the future outlook of the company then you would vote yes and hope that they don't use the 43k shares to dilute before the big squeeze happens or recklessly sell too early when the squeeze is happening."
2021-04-16 00:21:00,wallstreetbets," Now the AMC’s got Paulie as a partner. Any problems, AMC goes to Paulie. Trouble with the opening delays? He can go to Paulie. Trouble with the Covid, deliveries, Motion picture companies, he can call Paulie. But now AMC’s gotta come up with Paulie's money every week, no matter what. Business bad? Fuck you, more shares. Oh, you had a fire? Fuck you, more shares. Place got hit by lightning, huh? Fuck you, more shares!"
2021-04-15 20:22:46,wallstreetbets,This kind of thing would never happen in Venezuela.

2021-04-16 11:17:10,wallstreetbets,I really don't get why the GME crowd is so hostile against AMC. It's like they're taking it as a personal attack that some people want to buy and hold something other than just GME.
2021-04-16 08:01:08,wallstreetbets,"Ahh excuse me, I believe you meant smooth brain apes."
2021-04-15 22:32:09,wallstreetbets,Why would they do that? Don’t you understand they would only issue shares to fund something? So like if this year is great they wouldn’t need to issue them.. but maybe they decide to issue those shares still because they interested in an acquisitions. I think the company does have interest in keeping its share price as high as possible.
2021-04-16 05:36:05,wallstreetbets,we don't like that word here
2021-04-15 23:40:03,wallstreetbets,"You’re an idiot! 22% shorted, but do you have any idea how many FTD’ are there???? Plus 89% is the ownership of the outstanding shares and utilization is at 99%."
2021-04-16 04:54:56,wallstreetbets,"Using logic is apparently taboo, amc isn't the same as gme and these retards that think it is are just prolonging gme."
2021-04-16 01:45:21,wallstreetbets,I still think that I can always bet on people doing things they think will lead to the best outcome for themselves.  Adam Aaron gave his sons a ton of shares so AMC squeezing benefits his family tremendously
2021-04-15 20:33:16,wallstreetbets,"If you have FUD, just watch the whole interview on trey's trade youtube channel, i watched it this morning, it is very good."
2021-04-16 04:57:55,wallstreetbets,"You seem to think you know better than anyone else, can I interest you in some dunning-kruger?"
2021-04-16 14:52:19,wallstreetbets,"They’ve always been concerned that people investing in other shorts will reduce their momentum. 

What they’ve consistently failed to realize is that not every person who is investing out there has the cash to out into GME. It’s much easier to but 50 shares of AMC than GME.

Also, many of the original WSB crowd are not trading stocks but rather doing options betting. In that scenario you don’t necessarily have the same frame reference. I believe Roaring kitty made his money on collecting 0.20 GME puts that were out there. It may not be like putting down $200/share but the options contracts today assume you have at minimum a few thousand you’re going to be betting with."
2021-04-15 20:35:52,wallstreetbets,"karma and awards...this is why you are here? You fuckin' kidding me?
get a life dude...seriously"
2021-04-16 02:17:35,wallstreetbets,"Ok I get what you are saying, but then why create the shares in the first place?

You gotta read between the lines here.

The reason they are not issuing the shares this year is because every paper hand will pull out their money immediately and crash the stock price overnight."
2021-04-16 01:40:17,wallstreetbets,You better hope that if they do sell when the squeeze happens they do it gradually and start at the very top and finish on the way down. Because last Jan they fucked a lot of people and left them holding the bag before it even hit 20.
2021-04-16 13:39:50,wallstreetbets,"Please dont tell me you think that theres a shelf somewhere where theres unsold shares just waiting to be bought.

And I'm gonna reiterate this. 22% shorted means theres 78% still not-shorted that the shorters can purchase to close out their short position. 

This is not gamestop, and 22% short is not high. Sun works, Rene Sola, and Atari, to name 3 in a row I checked at random,  are all more shorted than AMC is."
2021-04-16 07:11:49,wallstreetbets,GME today also isn’t GME it was in January. Both stocks aren’t shorted nearly high enough  to have a squeeze.
2021-04-15 23:05:17,wallstreetbets,*confirmation bias*
2021-04-16 10:39:03,wallstreetbets,"I'll put my biased opinion against your ""facts"" anytime. Now get back to your minimum wage job, those grocery carts aren't going to return themselves."
2021-04-15 20:44:23,wallstreetbets,"The vote and filing isn't to issue 500m new shares. It's a vote to authorize AMC to issue uo to 500m shares if they need to at any point in the future.

This is standard. Companies have an authorized amount of shares they can issue. It's an arrow in their quiver.

And the reason you have a vote now is because they pretty much used up their previous supply.

The company isn't going to issue 500m shares at once. That would be insane. They are big shareholders themselves.

Note everytime they issued shares in the past led to a big spike in the share price."
2021-04-15 22:32:29,wallstreetbets,They don't need you to sell bc they'll sell their own shares.
2021-04-16 04:57:02,wallstreetbets,Hint: they don't want you to sell your amc shares
2021-04-16 15:32:41,wallstreetbets,That makes sense. Thank you for explaining their frame of reference.

New investor? 2 get rich quick stocks, ones only 10 dollars?

Derp. Get played, gme is the only one that's got squeeze potential, cinema is dead."
2021-04-16 05:06:29,wallstreetbets,💩
2021-04-16 03:20:53,wallstreetbets,"I think they are worried the company could face bankruptcy again if the pandemic continues on. They want to be ready to sell shares and survive. 
I do not think they have any intention of selling shares unless needed. 

Again I am quite a believe the people will return to movie theaters. I also think this publicity the company has received over this whole stock fiasco will drive more business."
2021-04-16 13:25:50,wallstreetbets,"You're correct, probably. 

GME was officially shorted greater than 100%. It was published data. It was at 140% shorted. Verifiable numbers. 

AMC has never and never will have over 100% of shares shorted. 

All of you who ""believe"" its heavily shorted, but ignore that its around 20% shorted (because that's the numbers on the bloomberg terminal), which is way closer to 0% than it is to 100%, are just going to be holding on to your shares indefinitely hoping for a rocket launch that's not going to happen. 

AMC started its decline in December of 2016 a full 3 years before Covid hit. Re opening the economy is not going to cause AMC to go up to levels from 5 years ago. Either someone lied to you all, or they made you believe that they knew what they were talking about when they clearly did not. 

Go ahead and downvote. WSB is not a place for people who get their feelings hurt when someone tells them they're flat out wrong."
2021-04-16 07:24:40,wallstreetbets,"Then ill wait for it to hit 450 based of fundamentals and pull out, which is completely realistic within a year with Ryan Cohen. 

Majority of my buys are sub $50, so its win win either way for me."
2021-04-16 11:37:12,wallstreetbets,I'm a senior dev 😂😂
2021-04-16 03:44:27,wallstreetbets,"Also, they discover sintetic shares when counting.
I don't know why so many negativity in this forum about AMC, their numbers and their position now for the squeeze are for sure the best ever, and it is mostly sure the best positioned stock in the market for that, much more than GME. 
I think HFs took WSB control."
2021-04-16 07:50:41,wallstreetbets,"It's just hilarious to check your history's and find so much GME. All you people try and shit on AMC while somehow believing that Gamestop is going to magically replace Newegg, amazon, or steam.

Fundamentally, long term AMC has a much brighter and more predictable future. You gme apes are banking on a total reinvention of an almost dead company and simply assuming it will work out great.

Short term, AMC is shorted to hell and they are running out of ammo. Everything is pointing to a short squeeze, while GMEs numbers have fallen off a cliff. Your best chance for any sort of squeeze is a share recall to find the synthetic shares, and that's nowhere in sight.

A theatre chain in the UK has nothing to do with the largest theatre chain in the world. Theatres aren't going to die and the largest player is by far the most likely to survive. Look at how many landlords and businesses bent over backwards to help AMC survive the pandemic."
2021-04-16 03:46:23,wallstreetbets,"So I posted this before. But I did see one small survey that was done in the UK. Something like 45% of people surveyed said the number one thing they want to see  reopened is movie theatres.

I am 100% behind you here bro.

Best of luck with the stock"
2021-04-16 07:51:27,wallstreetbets,Lololol 450 based on fundamentals. What sort of fairy land do you live in?

I'm just using logic, to me as a logical person watching everything unfold, it seems to me that amc is the easy distraction, throw it in with gme evey now and then.

Cinema is definitely dying, and to deny that is to deny reality.

Who cares its all a casino, gl in your bets, but to me it makes absolutely no sense why you'd buy amc over a fresh board at gme."

2021-04-16 08:42:55,wallstreetbets,"Because the risk is higher with GME now. I missed the boat at 20 bucks, and again at 40 after the first squeeze. I stand to make much more if AMC does what I expect it to.

If I got in GME early, that would be a different story."
2021-04-16 08:41:45,wallstreetbets,"And you let me know which funko pop you buy on your next trip to Gamestop.

Regardless I really hope we both squeeze, there's nothing but respect from AMC apes to GME, but it's clear many of you have done minimal research on AMC and for some reason seem threatened by it. Any time AMC gets mentioned here we gotta go back to square 1 trying to educate people that it's not all doom and gloom."

But its w.e, you do you."

2021-04-16 08:44:58,wallstreetbets,"DFV’s Walter Mitty tweet? 

I’ve never seen the movie, so I went to Wikipedia (where else) to get sum straight factz. What I found in the plot synopsis was, well, shocking!:

“Walter Mitty is a negative assets manager at Life magazine who daydreams of adventures... Mitty works with legendary photojournalist Sean O'Connell, although they have never met in person. O'Connell has sent Mitty his latest negatives... The negative is missing, forcing Walter to stall for time with corporate transition manager Ted Hendricks, who is handling the downsizing.”

Negatives assets going missing, and stalling for time until they can be retrieved? Sounds a lot like FTDs and naked shorts right?

There’s a ton more in there but it all gets a bit tin-foilly. ‘Negative assets’ really stood out for me, took my smooth brain a while to figure out they were talking about photos but it’s the kind of smart cryptic breadcrumb that DFV would leave for us window lickers.

TL;DR: Walter Mitty manages NEGATIVE ASSETS that GO MISSING and result in a WILD GOOSE CHASE.

And remember, it may not moon today, it may not moon next week, it may not even moon this year, but whilst there is faith, the moon is ultimately inevitable.

AMC still has 43M shares from before that they haven’t exercised and would before what the’re asking for now.

To answer your question, they don’t  ‘exist’ until the company exercises them, they need to be created in order to be given away."

2021-04-15 23:01:27,wallstreetbets,"You should sign up for the Starlink beta, if in the budget, and see if you can get that. Upfront cost is about $500 and monthly service is $99. Various reviews so far are positive.

As to the physical games, that part of the business is in slow decline and not likely to grow in any meaningful way to support the price, whereas a good cloud platform might make a difference."

2021-04-15 20:47:42,wallstreetbets,"Jokes not on me, l know they get money when people sell. I’m discussing the economics behind it, not a short term play.

Imagine crypto crashed and sat for 2-3 years like it has until recently and that signaled everyone to not touch crypto. There would be no revenue stream, the entire business model is contingent upon the strength of the crypto market. But imagine being a share holder and have to wait 2-3 more years for movement again. Good business have good revenue coming in at all times, no just when the market is hot or cold."
2021-04-16 00:43:08,wallstreetbets,Why are there no options on $COIN?
2021-04-15 21:40:04,wallstreetbets,Time to short this to 100. It might get there before GME.

2021-04-16 02:00:53,wallstreetbets,"I think it's a better idea to buy the ""underlying asset"", the token that fuels the network, because of Metacalfe law. In fact, Coinbase's first investor who put in $300k in 2012 would have made more money by a factor of 1x to 8x if he had just bought the underlying asset that year.

He got $2B from the IPO and could have gotten $1.8B to $9B if he had bought the asset."

2021-04-15 20:39:43,wallstreetbets,"On the E*TRADE mobile app, go to Menu -> Settings -> Enable Real-Time Streaming. Or maybe it was Menu -> My Profile -> Manage Subscriptions -> check all the free options. I think this may be a bit redundant, but you might as well enable everything you can. 

It’s a similar process on web browser, but I don’t have my computer in front of me right now.

**EDIT**: You do have to fill out forms / agree to terms and conditions in order to trade options, trade with margin, or trade during after hours/premarket. I’m sure you already know that, but it’s not too difficult to sign up for that stuff. Also: Power E*TRADE is a pretty good trading platform if you haven’t used that yet."

What's the difference between that and paying to go back stage at a concert or one on one time with a celebrity or personal idol? People pay all the time to be around winners.

If we marry, and I continue to make more than him, I won’t hold that over him and make unilateral large financial decisions without his input. We’re a team.

If I was just getting in and wanted to get good exposure and hadn't had time to do any research yet, SILJ is probably where I would part the bulk of my intended investment, then sell out pieces of it when I decide which specific companies I want to invest in for stronger exposure to those I view as the best based on my own (or others) analysis.

I highly recommend starting ones research with this source:  
[https://www.silverchartist.com/silver](https://www.silverchartist.com/silver)

His free weekly newsletter is incredible. I signed up for the paid one a while ago and hav found it to be the best introduction with the lowest barrier to entry that I've seen.

I'm also a fan of Dave Kranzler  
[https://investmentresearchdynamics.com/](https://investmentresearchdynamics.com/)  
Another newsletter that is very affordable, though his isn't as user friendly as SilverChartist, he's been around for a long time and hasn't increased his prices yet.

do as you will, best of luck!"
2021-04-16 14:44:46,wallstreetbets,"This is a fairly good resource, just KEEP IN MIND that Gold Ventures is constantly updating his own list of what he's in.  He isn't telling you or anyone else what to do, he is showing what he is doing. This means he changes it fairly frequently, and a company he invested in he may completely sell out of and go elsewhere RIGHT AFTER you buy into it.  Do your own Due Diligience to make sure YOU want to invest in the company before following his lead. If he sells right AFTER you buy and the price drops hard, you can't reasonably blame him or anyone else.  It is/was your own decision.

So just keep that in mind.

Personally, I like EnviroMetal (EVVLF) as I think they're going to have a HUGE impact on the mining world overall, but you can look at their history to see they've been much higher. They're finally starting to get a lot of traction, but if you want to invest in a company that helps make miners more easily profitable and they are also much more environmentally friendly with how they do it, it's a good play IMO.

Note - I like and have some of the stock - I'm not impartial.AG's a fairly safe bet as well, and Endeavor just recently withheld metals from teh market as they think the prices are being supressed, so supporting them supports the movement in general.

Again though, make your own decisions as you can only hold yourself responsible for the profits and losses you realize.

Unless of course we're talking about the scumbags at Robinhood which cost me tens of thousands of dollars via their actions.  We can totally blame them."

2021-04-16 12:07:03,wallstreetbets,"So here is my thoughts on AAPL they are leading the industry on product and service integration. The service part of the business which is kind of new is growing and subscription based.

Apple is definitely still growing and for the leading tech company they honestly don’t have many products. But whatever product they create becomes #1 in popularity in its respective market. Shoot I don’t know how to create a trillion dollar company so I’m going to let them hold my money because they do."
2021-04-16 12:09:32,wallstreetbets,yup you got it.  if they built a trillion dollar company and have 100 billion in sales a quarter ... it's not hard to figure out where I put my hard earned bones so I can make easy boners.

2021-04-16 03:05:38,wallstreetbets,do you see the expiration date?
2021-04-16 11:21:24,wallstreetbets,"Okay, I raised hell with Fidelity when they refused my application and then reapplied and also changed my risk tolerance to, ""where's the casino"" and then it was quickly approved.

So today when the price dipped to 7.30 I bid .50 cents for three contracts expiring May 21 with a 7.50 strike price.

I think this means I'll need to actually reach 8$ a share before I recover my contract price.

I don't know if 50 cents was reasonable or if I could get better prices in different situations but I think I'll make some money in May and at the least this is more entertaining than playing the lotto."
2021-04-16 16:17:04,wallstreetbets,"great DD but I didn't follow through. Loaded up on 4/16 XLF $35c after Wednesday earnings were good and saw the upward trend.

2021-04-16 17:56:32,wallstreetbets,I thought you were going to keep checking in on me?
2021-04-16 18:06:42,wallstreetbets,"I think I said I'd check in every dollar up.  We haven't hit the next dollar up.

Are you still holding?

I sold my calls for $500 and rolled my short puts out 2 weeks and down to $23.50 strike, collecting another $100.   So I've collected about $640 or so and I'm short 12x Apr 30 $23.50 puts.

Mark-to-market, I'm down about $1400, but I feel good about these puts expiring worthless after enough rolling.  At this point, it's devolved into a theta gang play which I'm not generally a fan of but I like this stock long term so it's all good."
2021-04-15 20:19:57,wallstreetbets,"I followed your lead and bought the may 28,  21, $9.50 call, market should collapse tomorrow and work out fine"
2021-04-15 20:53:20,wallstreetbets,"I can't tell if you're joking or not when you say it'll collapse tomorrow :) Just be careful with long calls on this contract, because the value will drop over time as the forward contracts roll over with contango. Unless you're absolutely sure it will drop, you should never stay longer than 2-3 days on the long-side."
2021-04-15 21:57:15,wallstreetbets,"Good to know, I am half serious about the short positions having to cover GME, at some point (maybe 4/15-4/20)and it causing the vix to spike.  Last time I saw them play monkey business with GME I bought VXX and it worked well because they had to sell good stocks to cover"
2021-04-15 22:06:02,wallstreetbets,"It's smart to hedge, but I wouldn't use the VXX to cover GME. GME could have a blowout, and hardly make a dent on VIX (underlying) as it covers the entire S&P 500 options market.   


WallStreet already expects GME to collapse, so there'd be no panic, except among the bag holders of course."

2021-04-15 21:38:09,wallstreetbets,"Splunk’s moat is supported by strong user metrics, with cloud dollar-based net retention being best-in- class and consistently north of 120%. As of fiscal 2020, over 90% of Fortune 100 companies use Splunk’s platform to monitor and analyze data. The number of customers generating over $1 million in annual recurring revenue also expanded to 510 in fiscal 2021, compared with 124 in fiscal 2018. These figures point to increased adoption of Splunk’s platform. We also consider Splunk as a leader in the IT Operations Management and security space, as few firms can address a similar breadth of data use cases.
-Morningstar 4/1/21

Seems like they are doing well in the customer retention space, if not growing?"
2021-04-15 22:41:26,wallstreetbets,What about datadog?
2021-04-16 05:37:58,wallstreetbets,"increasing the amount of customers generating >1m ARR is a good sign - but remember, Splunk have been on a path of massively increasing their licensing cost. So this doesn't necessarily mean that they are getting new, large customers, or that their existing customers are growing their use cases. It could just be that existing customers have renewed on to the new licensing structure, which is so much more expensive that they are now >1m ARR. You could say that's a good thing, but many customers aren't happy with the increase, so in my view, it's a short sighted gain that is only prompting people to leave and will hurt them long term. We might not have seen a mass exodus, but that doesn't mean plans aren't being created to leave. These plans can take a couple years sometimes. Anyway, I'm no genie - but I don't think Splunk is a good long term play."

Basically bonds are uncorrelated with stocks, and while they're *usually* negatively correlated, that's not always the case, so it would be wrong to make a general statement saying bonds are *always* negatively correlated with stocks. Thankfully that correlation seems to be reliably negative when we need it the most - during periods of market turmoil. 

As you noted, we hope for negative correlation, but sometimes they do move in the same direction."

Adding in things like the Suez whereby you bubbly react **make it very fucking clear you are in lacking context to the greater world and how things operate.**  

When there's already manufactured reasons for hiking prices the Suez just adds on; this is the world as it is, not how you want it to be.  Again, manufactured crises are transient and are not indicative of a long term trend, I suspect things will change in 4 yrs or less my friend."

yea the FED Is already talking about preparing people for 4% inflation this year.... inflation isn't known for going negative as the FED tends to do what it can to well prevent that from occurring as shown by them lowing the interest rates in 2018 and 2019 and again in 2020."

NEE 

5/21 80c @ 2.5 

9/17 85c @ 2.70 

ICLN 

5/21 24c @ .70

I'm still thinking I can make it out with a 50-100% gain.
