2021-04-07 19:29:42,wallstreetbets,"Anyone else sick of politicians pouring millions of dollars into stocks, just to days later announce legislation or plans that directly benefit the exact stocks they invested in? Like when pelosi dumped over a million dollars into tesla 3 days before biden announced they were switching the USPS fleet to electric vehicles

Edit: 3 days is more like a month because people dont understand exaggeration"
2021-04-07 19:31:26,wallstreetbets,Read exactly how much of this trillion dollar BS is actually going to the infrastructure
2021-04-07 19:50:45,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is not a good inflation play.  The infrastructure bill, like the recent stimulus bill, is long on pork and short on help and improvements.  Eating might be a bigger concern than investing in 4 years.  Pray we survive better than CA, NY, or Chicago under this same idiotic leadership."

2021-04-07 19:06:17,wallstreetbets,They need a successful test flight first I think. SPCE has been dropping ever since they had to delay their last test flight.

2021-04-07 19:39:21,wallstreetbets,"they have a reliable track record but they haven't hit their stride or launch schedule yet.  I don't follow them too closely, but I heard they are starting to try recovering boosters, that might help them a bit or it could bite them in the ass."

2021-04-07 18:04:22,wallstreetbets,For real. I cannot believe how smart some of these bears are. They predict a correction will happen before the Sun dies out. How can they predict shit like this? Incredible.

2021-04-07 17:33:02,wallstreetbets,Never happen. Our military is as large as the second thru tenth countries combined on the list. The old Ussr tried to match our military spending and they went tits up.

2021-04-07 17:41:25,wallstreetbets,"Thank you.  Folks here don't realize we always maintain a 20 year advantage.  Even our Hypersonic failures are just disinformation ops.  China is major land force on it's own soil, but we dominate the seas and space."

2021-04-07 17:51:59,wallstreetbets,So true I would actually put it at a30 year advantage based on the technology in that drone Iran downed during the Obama administration.

2021-04-07 17:50:45,wallstreetbets,Video is fubar. What he‚Äôs referring to as a manpower advantage is just that they have way more useless eaters than us.
2021-04-07 19:25:17,wallstreetbets,"They have about 40 more ships, and millions more troops. 
However our ships and servicemen are far superior or they wouldn‚Äôt keep stealing our technology.

2021-04-07 18:40:46,wallstreetbets,"Don't sweat it.  She/It/Adeadmind probably too brainwashed or stupid on historical facts that we took an entire country plus it's regions in 100 hours, and an entire Eastern Block of the world in less than 8 years, saving all of humanity in the process.  Sometimes living in a basement does that to grown-ass people with no mind of their own."
2021-04-07 19:41:41,wallstreetbets,"Well, at a minimum we know the capabilities include gaining access to and stealing PII from both government agencies and civilian economic powerhouses.  We know this because they already do it.  Their government sponsors hackers, potentially in the tens of thousands, in both the public and private.  This is not a secret."
2021-04-07 19:30:30,wallstreetbets,Photus Buyden has absolutely no input on any military decisions. The military is taking orders from Trump who is in Mar a lago. Buyden is President of a bankrupt corporation who is residing on a movie set White House at castle rock studios. He‚Äôs not even allowed in the Pentagon. Sleep tight my friend. The best is yet to come.
2021-04-07 18:02:56,wallstreetbets,Murica baby! Don‚Äôt tread on us!
2021-04-07 18:21:34,wallstreetbets,Well if thats all that matters we nearly spend three times the amount China does on military and almost 15 times the amount then the Russians. If moneys all that matters.
2021-04-07 19:21:12,wallstreetbets,Murica baby!
2021-04-07 19:47:18,wallstreetbets,Our own government is working to destroy our nation. A company by the name of Loral years ago sold our technology to China at President Clinton‚Äôs request. Pelosi helped engineer a sale of GE to a CCP company. They make many defense products for our military. Trump squashed the sale. The point I‚Äôm trying to make is the leaders of these countries are all in the same club that hate us. Who knows what really happens when there‚Äôs a major hack. It could be our corrupt politicians transferring information for cash under the guise of a hack.
2021-04-07 19:33:50,wallstreetbets,I think I heard that somewhere
2021-04-07 18:53:08,wallstreetbets,I wish we cared about our vets as much as you care about your glory

2021-04-07 19:36:17,wallstreetbets,More people are realizing something is very off. Trump waiting as long as he can so more people get their heads out of their asses. He doesn‚Äôt realize a lot of people will never get it. This ending is not for everyone.
2021-04-07 19:58:29,wallstreetbets,"How are they getting the intelligence from GE? GE is a public company. Not a nationalized company. If the intel wasn‚Äôt available to them, which it‚Äôs not, a sale is the only way."
2021-04-07 19:42:00,wallstreetbets,"Ok, now you‚Äôre getting into the conspiracy area. Trump is loving life and turning orange again. After the way this country treated him, I would be surprised if he wanted to endure the BS again. On the other hand Biden has to be the dumbest president ever. After all he was the dumbest person to serve in the senate, and the dumbest to be Vice President. He has the trifecta"
2021-04-07 19:51:46,wallstreetbets,"A lie is a lie, even if everyone believes it. The truth is the truth, even if nobody believes it.
Go on bitchute and watch some x22 report videos, or Charli Ward, or Simon Parkes. They get high end intel from people who are in the room. They‚Äôre all saying the same thing. I believe them. The only way this information gets to the dummies is through an EBS message. Have you noticed an increase in EBS testing. Supposed to be once a month. I viewed 2 of them yesterday."

2021-04-07 17:05:11,wallstreetbets,I heard his biggest investment is gored futures so you know if I were you I would buy some chords. You can even like literally go to the supermarket and buy gourds and if you just hold on to those gourds for long enough you'll be able to take him back and they will give you a higher price so discover supermarket and buy a couple $1000 in ornamental gourds
2021-04-07 17:23:37,wallstreetbets,"Long time(long, long time) BRK investor.  Thing is, its really hard to time and its had a good run.   Personally should get a good pop after earnings but after your expiration.   Right now the company can't buy back stock(blackout prior to earnings).   I just buy shares and trade in and out of them.  Options on this stock probably very tricky because trading volumes are so low.   It can easily go nowhere for months then gap up.  I would probably book the $7K gain.   
 Good luck."
2021-04-07 16:46:26,wallstreetbets,"Why cash out Brk.B is the most well diversified undervalued company right now.

Accounting rules make it so that berkshire can only count dividends paid from its subsidiaries as income...

Also, BRK has a better credit rating then the u.s govt now."

I got into some qqq calls a little over a month ago for 4/30 that went up 4K overnight and held. Tech chopped for this past month and it was a rough time while averaging down throughout. Through much gamblers remorse, alcohol, and anxiety, I was able to close at profit this week. Moral of the story, take your gains when they‚Äôre there but be psychotic enough to average down on what seems like a dying position... not weeklies or some bullshit like that though."

2021-04-07 17:03:44,wallstreetbets,So?
2021-04-07 17:16:07,wallstreetbets,"So, a stock being undervalued doesn‚Äôt make it ready to climb even higher RIGHT NOW.  Right now those calls are worth something.  If the underlying goes back down or stays the same, profits turns to losses.  Keep in mind the break even price is literally ‚Äúbreak even,‚Äù so if it stays the same he will break even at expiry.  It is currently AT a significant level of resistance, which means it needs to break that resistance for continued profit, and every day he holds waiting for it to break and shoot up the profit goes down, and if the guess is wrong, well, that ends up being a loss.  You don‚Äôt HOLD calls, you take fucking profit.  Especially at a 50% return"
2021-04-07 17:34:26,wallstreetbets,"Dude, your in the wrong sub... and TA doesn't work...

in the biggest bull market in a stock that has very little volatility with a planned shareholder buyback and a month until expiry... if op thinks they are still undervalued which he said he thinks it has more room to run there is little reason to sell them... take profits when you reach your target, not when  it's just getting started."

2021-04-07 17:27:45,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing this whole time. I went to school with some guys that work there now...top of the class CS majors from Stanford. Palantir software job offers are arguably harder to get than Google/Facebook/Amazon/Microsoft. That‚Äôs one of the many big reasons I believe in it long term...the talent is next to none.

2021-04-07 17:04:58,wallstreetbets,The beauty of keeping cash on the sidelines and averaging down! I opened my first position in the 25s and bought all the way down. Bought the last few shares to get to 20k on the {normal} morning dump today.
2021-04-07 17:18:17,wallstreetbets,Already doing it. Selling $65 Jan 2023 calls for around $300 a contract. Will rotate to shorter term if IV spikes.
2021-04-07 18:29:34,wallstreetbets,"Married, sorry bud"
2021-04-07 19:08:43,wallstreetbets,"I bought in when they proved they could apply all the work they‚Äôve done for the government to the commercial sector. I‚Äôm a government contractor and have seen the barrier to entry first hand (once you‚Äôre in, it takes a whole lot to change). So, I feel Palantir has a solid base in government work. On the commercial side, I can see them taking a lot of market share from the big consulting firms by providing companies with the infrastructure to find solutions to their problems themselves instead of hiring a BCG or Bain to help. I also am convinced their software and talent is superior given their history and hiring process. Remember...the internet was created with DoD advanced research funding üòâ"
2021-04-07 19:09:44,wallstreetbets,Will be watching closely
2021-04-07 19:29:29,wallstreetbets,"Currently selling $65 Jan 2023 CC until IV picks up. Then, I‚Äôll rotate to more short term way OTM CC."
2021-04-07 17:21:27,wallstreetbets,"I plan to keep buying for the next 10 months, then sit on them for atleast a year, they can be red from now till next Xmas (aslong as they climb to the promised 50usd  the day I sell obviously üòú)

Has anyone also go in on QELL?? 

I'm not rich enough to buy loads of each in one go so I'm stacking them slowly. 

I'm fresh so rip me a new one if that's to much of a standard question."
2021-04-07 18:46:43,wallstreetbets,Dassit I‚Äôm canceling my Verizon plan and going to metro and I work at Verizon LOL!
2021-04-07 19:39:33,wallstreetbets,I'm literally retarded. Can you explain to this moron what this means? Is it that you're selling it at a $65 strike believing that it won't  hit that price and just expire?
2021-04-07 17:39:43,wallstreetbets,"i switched last week to TDA and it was straight forward. doing a full account transfer (about 3 clicks on the new brokerage) takes about a week until you see all your positions. yes, it's a pain and you won't be able to trade for about 3 to 4 days, but now i have peace of mind. i'd actually recommend Fidelity, but either way, i want to assure you that once you make the decision it is pretty easy. similar to you, i started with RH in 2016 so it took a lot of resolve to move out."
2021-04-07 17:00:00,wallstreetbets,I love this place
2021-04-07 19:30:40,wallstreetbets,Dad give you a small loan of a million dollars?

2021-04-07 17:28:37,wallstreetbets,nice how excited are you for next week?
2021-04-07 16:54:19,wallstreetbets,Good investment for a few years down the road
2021-04-07 17:47:35,wallstreetbets,"DFV, is that you?"
2021-04-07 18:39:55,wallstreetbets,So let‚Äôs see a squeeze
2021-04-07 17:10:03,wallstreetbets,Serious question: Why sell the CCs at such a far out expiry? I sell $40 at 45 DTE
2021-04-07 16:59:19,wallstreetbets,What's a deldo and why do you stuff gerbils up your butt?
2021-04-07 17:23:44,wallstreetbets,"I think PLTR is much safer than QELL. And technically if you have a stake in PLTR, you have a stake in QELL."
2021-04-07 17:23:37,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm waiting for it to drop to 21 then I‚Äôll add more
2021-04-07 18:59:04,wallstreetbets,"Haha, T-Mobile ftw üôå"
2021-04-07 19:42:12,wallstreetbets,"Selling one CC at a strike of $65 means that if the price of PLTR is above $65 on the date of expiration, then I sell 100 shares to the buyer at $65. That‚Äôs all üòä if it isn‚Äôt $65 at expiration, I just keep my shares.

So, I sell a CC if I‚Äôm ok with selling my shares at $65 in 2 years.

Edit: The downside is, if PLTR is like $200 at expiration, then I‚Äôm still selling my shares for $65 (so upside potential is limited)."
2021-04-07 17:49:02,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
2021-04-07 19:36:42,wallstreetbets,"Hahahahaha, I wish he could (but not really if I were completely honest)"
2021-04-07 18:08:52,wallstreetbets,"Arguably it does to a certain extent. 40 P/S is high, so the expectations are high. But, I think the price is pricing in the guidance that they gave on their growth (which I think they sandbagged/undershot guidance on purpose). We‚Äôll see in the coming earnings."
2021-04-07 17:29:39,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll be watching the double click demo closely. Looking for a dumbed down explanation that is less technical so they can market it better.
2021-04-07 19:52:53,wallstreetbets,So teenage jesus then?
2021-04-07 17:15:24,wallstreetbets,"The calls won‚Äôt bite me in the butt unless this actually does more than 3x in less than 2 years. And even then, I‚Äôm ok with selling at $65 in 2 years."
2021-04-07 17:13:56,wallstreetbets,"Good question, IV is relatively low right now, so further DTE calls have more time premium instead of IV. If IV picks up, I can always rotate into shorter term CC."
2021-04-07 19:52:18,wallstreetbets,Lemmiwinks is just checking for colon cancer.
2021-04-07 19:45:51,wallstreetbets,That makes sense. Thanks for the clear explanation ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)
2021-04-07 18:09:15,wallstreetbets,Def take this advice...I‚Äôm w Ameritrade also...it‚Äôll be free for you with ur giant fucking portfolio...RH is using ur money to short against PLTR right now...do the tranfer tomorrow...they‚Äôre legit begging for money even w an IPO coming out..they are fucked dude.

2021-04-07 17:02:26,wallstreetbets,That was merely the exploratory committee to figure out where we would land. It returned faster than expected and we've been waiting to refuel.
2021-04-07 17:00:28,wallstreetbets,Those three listed are actually one single sale of 500 million. That sale was a private sale at above market price likely to a major investor (my money is on Buffett) and was to fund a charitable donation and actually bodes very well for the stock.
2021-04-07 16:47:52,wallstreetbets,It's been covered in the news. Priced in with this week's drop.

‚ÄúToday‚Äôs mortgage refinance rates have fallen since last Thursday, with 20-year rates dropping below 3% for the first time in seven days. Average rates across all loan types remain low at 2.719%. ‚Äú"
2021-04-07 18:10:36,wallstreetbets,"I'm looking at the 30yr fixed and it has risen 20% from the beginning of the year.  If the trend continues, it'll be bad for RKT.  If it drops, it'll be good for RKT.  That's all I'm saying.  But the trend for the rest of the year is upward. Higher inflation, higher yield on 10yr note which leads to higher mortgage rates.  But hope OP makes a killing on his position."

The government ALWAYS supports GM because they provide too many jobs and the feds cannot see them fail. I own GM stock now. Also, I own a lot of BB stock that I bought long before the meme stock craze and still hold. All the EV manufacturers will be competing to sell a car while BB‚Äôs QNX/IVY platform will (already has) secured the operating system for almost all of them. Big VW announcement today with BB and BB currently has 23 out of the top 25 EV manufacturers as customers. You probably know all this, but I don‚Äôt understand how everyone on WSB does not see it with BB. I bought more BB yesterday for $8.99. I hold 5,000 shares now. BB, GM and VW are the EV plays for me. That is all."

2021-04-07 18:55:35,wallstreetbets,"Listen up WSB and hear me out. I‚Äôm not sure about Tesla any longer. I used to own Tesla stock, but got in cheap and sold at $700. I posted today that GM might be the EV play going forward. Other EV manufacturers will be competing for every car sale now with Biden‚Äôs EV plan. I like GM only because Biden has $174 billion for the EV market and I see GM getting a big chunk of that. The government ALWAYS supports GM because they provide too many jobs and the feds cannot see them fail. I own GM stock now. Also, I own a lot of BB stock that I bought long before the meme stock craze and still hold. All the EV manufacturers will be competing to sell a car while BB‚Äôs QNX/IVY platform will (already has) secured the operating system for almost all of them. Big Volvo announcement today with BB and BB currently has 23 out of the top 25 EV manufacturers as customers. You probably know all this, but I don‚Äôt understand how everyone on WSB does not see it with BB. I bought more BB yesterday for $8.99. I hold 5,000 shares now at less than that average. Also, stop selling your s**t because a politician has something to say, the same thing  they‚Äôve said for the last 3 weeks. I‚Äôm pretty sure Queen Cathie didn‚Äôt liquidate her portfolio today because Biden or JPow had something to say. She probably bought more of everything she owns actually. Pretty sure Warren Buffet held all his stuff and, funny enough, owns about 9% of the Chinese EV manufacturer BYD and has never owned Tesla last I checked. Do the North American EV plays where the Biden money is."

2021-04-07 19:36:50,wallstreetbets,"There's no shame in cutting your losses if you think there's no hope, but here's some copium:

1). Literally no one could have predicted JPM dumping today unless they're an insider: ASO is/was a good play when you bought in (unless you bought at market open in which case....you never buy at market open. There were PLENTY of dips to get in)


2). During average volume and above-average volume, ASO held above $30 and $31 completely rock solid. It took AH swing trading and the aforementioned JPM to break that.


3). On the order book right now, the LOWEST sell order is a $31.72.


4). Even for 4/16s there is still 7 trading days left for a solid recovery that should enable you to get close to your break-even, if not past it, this time with less JPM fuckery.

Watch tomorrow's price action and decide for yourself what to do. Me personally, I'm holding and maybe even averaging down until I'm certain that there's no support left for the next two weeks; tomorrow and Friday should make the direction abundantly clear one way or the other."

2021-04-07 16:37:38,wallstreetbets,"The indices literally only move when the stocks move. But a big index swing can be a few winners with a lot of losers, a bunch of little winners, or one big winner in a sea of losers.

Different hedging strategies and the resulting beta can destroy certain stocks because the money is being moved from less reliable positions to more reliable ones.

A high index is just as good as a low index for a trader. Just a different sentiment."

2021-04-07 18:29:04,wallstreetbets,"Given how the stock has been performing on good news, it'd probably reach ATH"
2021-04-07 18:29:01,wallstreetbets,Probably go up 100%

It will still go up. But tomorrow is going to hurt."
2021-04-07 17:25:03,wallstreetbets,I have a 5/21 call. Hopefully it bounces back sometime in the near future
2021-04-07 16:06:11,wallstreetbets,"I keep buying more calls if it‚Äôs down. Really think it will come up, but I should also be buying next week instead of Friday lol. Don‚Äôt have the buying power for those tho"

2021-04-07 18:52:11,wallstreetbets,They love stating the obvious or getting the delusion that somebody will lose a lot of money on their advice and then hunt them down and sue them.
2021-04-07 18:51:18,wallstreetbets,Because they are sheep in ape‚Äôs clothing.
2021-04-07 18:52:05,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs so cringe. Like on YouTube with your actual self and your face yeah ok sure... but can a redditor really ever be sued on a place called fucking Wall Street BETS. No way. A judge would laugh.

2021-04-07 18:23:03,wallstreetbets,"Woahhh yea pull back buddy. Quit it for a few days and you‚Äôll detox pretty quick from caffeine. Then start back at much much lower doses. 

I bet your sleep is terrible. Prioritize it. Get 8 hours, not 7. And it needs to be quality. No caffeine after 3pm, make it pretty damn cold in your room, wear socks, try an eye mask. All those are proven to work"
2021-04-07 18:24:39,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not sure if this is serious, but I‚Äôd be careful. It didn‚Äôt bother me in my 20s, but around 30 I had some issues. I was also around 600-700 mg daily. I‚Äôve never had anxiety or health issues, and wound up in the ER for ‚Äúheart issues‚Äù. Ended up being caused by caffeine, triggering GERD, leading to a prolonged inflamed chest cavity, and panic attacks mimicking a heart attack. This is obviously just my experience, but I‚Äôd scale back. I‚Äôm all sorted out now, but 10/10 I don‚Äôt recommend! Everyone‚Äôs different though. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

2021-04-07 18:21:38,wallstreetbets,"looked it up, some health agency said 600 mg/day for adult should be limit

200mg at once should give you noticeable effects

400mg at once should make you feel enough to make you mildly uncomfortable

if that ain't doing it for you go for coke or speed"
2021-04-07 18:18:23,wallstreetbets,"Nah, probably not a good idea to do both at once."

And if it‚Äôs a yolo into a stable ticker off bad news you simply wait and make money anyways just later than expected. It‚Äôs like wearing a condom with a hooker vs going in raw."

2021-04-07 17:30:15,wallstreetbets,"That is absolutely the case. I just think its funny that none of them have considered that if any of the bullshit they're slinging was actually true, they could make significantly more money just waiting for it to happen **before** opening a position. Like none of them believe it is going to stay at ""$1,000,000"" a share, its baked into their ""thesis"" that hedgefunds will cover and liquidate immediately. Their plan is already to sell on the way down. 

Why not cut out the actual risk portion of this process and just wait for the squeeze and enter short positions? I mean a lot of people did that in January and made out like bandits. There is no logical reason to buy and hold indefinitely when you could put your money to work elsewhere and capitalize on the fall."
2021-04-07 16:37:12,wallstreetbets,Yeah I might swing trade ARKK if dips around 110 again but buy and hold is asking for significant pain in the short to medium term imo.

2021-04-07 16:02:45,wallstreetbets,"Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

‚ÄúWhen (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a ‚Äòpretty good game‚Äô.‚Äù

Anyone else notice how Cramer has been trying to induce FUD into retail investors and scare them out of American EV stocks? Meanwhile, we‚Äôre seeing the single greatest revolution in our country‚Äôs automotive industry since Henry Ford‚Äôs model T in 1908.

You want a ‚Äúpretty good game,‚Äù Cramer? I will buy $RIDE stock until all of your Wall Street and Hedge Fund buddies close their short positions against American EV companies.

That sounds like a good ‚Äúgame‚Äù to me.

2021-04-07 19:27:12,wallstreetbets,"Full disclosure: I do not own, and am not short this stock.

This is financial advice, which I can give, because it's a free country and I don't control other people's money:

Do not purchase this stock.

The company will be bankrupt in 6 months. It will never produce this truck. If you look at the entry list for the San Felipe 250, you'll notice that the Lordstown ""truck"" which doesn't even have airbags installed in it is the only vehicle in the ""EV"" class. It will ""win"" this race, and you'll see press releases about that, assuming it can finish the race, which is doubtful since it appears to me at least that the driver of the vehicle is intended at this point to be a person just out of high school.

Lordstown claims they are going to be mass producing vehicles in the next 6 months. If you peruse their job board, you'll notice that they aren't hiring for vehicle manufacturing positions in their Lordstown, OH facility. If you compare their public jobs listings with those of say, CCIV (not saying you should buy CCIV), you'll notice that CCIV has an actual factory, and is hiring hundreds (if not thousands) of actual people to construct their vehicle.

I've seen now, several attempts at people attempting to produce DD to support this company and they never mention these things. They'll wiz you with MACD bullcrap and chart analysis on a company that was taken public virtually yesterday and has no history of stock trading. Technical analysis is useless here.

Common sense is useful: Are they hiring people to construct vehicles? If they are, they're doing it secretly. Are their vehicles capable of being licensed to operate on US roadways? Not from any of the video's I've seen on their own website.

TL:dr Maybe they can produce a vehicle. I'll be waiting to see before I give them money to hire ""corporate wellness directors"" ... an actual job listing on their website."

2021-04-07 16:06:54,wallstreetbets,"A short seller report from Hindenburg asserted that their non-binding pre orders are not real orders and that the truck is vaporware.

They have plans to produce betas every day until they have 50+ for testing. They have a factory, tooling, an assembly line, backing from GM and WKHS, a battery deal with LG, a licensed and proven motor design, executives from TSLA, GM, WKHS, ample cash on hand and a solid business plan.  They have all they need to accomplish their goal of rolling their first vehicles off the line in the Fall. 

Hindenburg's chief assertion is that the 100,000 pre-orders don't exist.  Basically, saying there's no demand for an electric pickup truck.  Does that even feel remotely true to you?"

2021-04-07 17:38:51,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I do believe in Lordstown and that they are going to go somewhere. I drive past the factory every so often and there are cars in the lot from people working there, it's not like just an empty factory doing nothing. I like the trucks they want to build better than pretty much all of the competition. Like that it's fairly local, being from Ohio and not someplace like China or India. They seem to have a decent amount of partnerships and backing so I doubt they will be going anywhere before they start rolling out vehicles. Even if they somehow lost funding or backing, it seems like they would be a prime target to be bought out by or merged with another company

I bought a couple shares of $RIDE at the beginning of March then again in the middle of March. I have 12 shares at a cost basis of $16.67 per share. It has bothered me seeing the value in my shares go down by about $60 and that is a little disappointing. Hopefully it does turn around soon. I didn't buy the stock as some sort of get rich quick thing, figured it would be something I would hold onto and add more for a couple years or so. 

I'm not the best person to take advice from since I just started playing around with stocks earlier this year. I just have a couple thousand dollars in stocks and everything has basically evened out so far. Most I've picked have lost money (like RIDE), or stayed about the same, with the losses being offset by GME and AMC gains."

 This full size pick up truck that actually  LOOKS LIKE A TRUCK,  is going  sell at least $20,000 less  than the next rival.  It will also have 172 service centers  IN IT'S  PARTNER CAMPING  WORLD. That is way more than TESLA  or any  other competition.   They will be able to MASS PRODUCE  ( 1st mover advantage) before anyone else.  It's on fire sale now at 33% of ATH.

2021-04-07 18:42:23,wallstreetbets,"Good question. I hate to keep pointing to Tesla, but in such a new industry it's hard to point to any other relevant examples. In Tesla's case, first mover advantage was huge. If we sort by EV sales in 2018 [here](https://evadoption.com/ev-sales/evs-percent-of-vehicle-sales-by-brand/), we can see that Tesla sold 5X more electric vehicles than even the closest runner up, Chevy. Let's recall that Tesla wasn't a huge name back then, they just made it to the market first.

Sure, Ford, Chevy, Dodge, etc. will all undoubtedly release fully electric versions of their trucks eventually, but if Lordstown beats them to market like they plan to, where will they already be by then? That's your bet to make."

Tip #3 from: investorsunderground.com/pattern-day-trader-rule/

>It‚Äôs a reminder that the PDT rule restricts *round trip* trades. A round trip is where you buy and sell in the same day.  
>  
>Under this rule, you can still have multiple entries with one exit or multiple exits from one entry. For example, you could buy three lots of 200 shares, and sell 600 shares to exit the trade or vice versa. This can be effective for traders who feel pressured to go ‚Äúall in‚Äù in fear of wasting a day trade.  
>  
>***Important Note: Different brokers may have different definitions of ""round trips."" Make sure to check with your broker before utilizing this strategy. Some brokers allow one entry with multiple exits while others allow multiple entries with one exit.***"

2021-04-07 16:33:28,wallstreetbets,"When price go down, his calls should be also and vice versa but now when price went down his calls went up.

I'm too retarded to explain why that happened."
2021-04-07 18:56:37,wallstreetbets,I bought calls expiring next week too lmao. Much smaller position tho
2021-04-07 17:15:13,wallstreetbets,"i did, this is my least risky position tho"
2021-04-07 18:37:49,wallstreetbets,"ALL strikes above $270 were up today, some by 20%. Anything below $270 decreased in premium"
2021-04-07 19:38:42,wallstreetbets,780 a piece
2021-04-07 16:45:22,wallstreetbets,I think that‚Äôs the whole point....
2021-04-07 16:55:43,wallstreetbets,"why do u think IV going up?

IMO it's because MM cannot be short any more calls or they risk being gamma squoze. Unfortunately for MM they have to telegraph this by raising IV once a certain number of calls are open."
2021-04-07 18:01:43,wallstreetbets,I wont be hurting if this doesnt work out

2021-04-07 18:21:26,wallstreetbets,His calls have a strike of like $16. Pretty much impossible for them to end up OTM by next Friday
2021-04-07 19:26:23,wallstreetbets,"I also think that if he posts his YOLO update, showing that he exercise instead of sold his calls, that a ton of people are going to start buying shares because they're hyped up. If the hedge funds drive the price down before this happens, people will be even more likely to buy more shares. I doubt they're going to want the price at a low level at that time, keeping it high might discourage some new buyers."
2021-04-07 17:54:55,wallstreetbets,"He will most likely exercise them so his cost doesn't change, or not?"
2021-04-07 16:41:19,wallstreetbets,I think that strange noise in the distance is a war cry of theta gang

2021-04-07 16:56:31,wallstreetbets,"IMO, this means that MM cannot afford to be short more calls or they risk gamma squoze. So, they raise prices of calls."
2021-04-07 18:22:51,wallstreetbets,"vega, implied volatility went up today and vega in that option outweights delta by a lot."

2021-04-07 17:29:00,wallstreetbets,oof
2021-04-07 19:54:19,wallstreetbets,How does that affect MMs? As long as the calls don‚Äôt go ITM they don‚Äôt care. They made their premium.
2021-04-07 16:54:50,wallstreetbets,"exactly. why is IV going up? coz MM are fucked and they have to raise prices, they cannot afford to sell more calls at lower prices."
2021-04-07 19:33:39,wallstreetbets,Elon is that you

2021-04-07 19:19:05,wallstreetbets,So deep itm that they're basically shares. Pretty safe bet that he'll just exercise them if the price stays flat.
2021-04-07 18:23:23,wallstreetbets,"Oh I don't think he'll be OTM at all. But if the overall stock price drives down, his contacts values will drive down. Or he'll excise them and just hold the shares I guess. He does like the stock."
2021-04-07 18:48:43,wallstreetbets,"Nope. It's a $12 strike. So he will be able to exercise his 500 contracts for 50,000 shares at $12. 

It will cost him $600k to make an immediate $8.4 mil profit. (Avg of $180 per share).

2021-04-07 16:54:02,wallstreetbets,GME has been flat for like 2 weeks this is the bottom for IV
2021-04-07 16:38:22,wallstreetbets,"It's GME, iv would never crash"
2021-04-07 18:48:40,wallstreetbets,Ask urself who sets the price of IV
2021-04-07 18:36:26,wallstreetbets,Basically the downward movement in price led to upward movement in IV (ie more uncertainty about its future price). Higher IV results in higher option prices
2021-04-07 17:41:11,wallstreetbets,What the fuck is an option?
2021-04-07 17:50:50,wallstreetbets,"Out of the money (OTM) call options should decrease in price as their time to expiry lessens because the decreased chance that the call will finish ""In the money"". That's theta decay.

The 4/16 800c should have decreased today given the aforementioned theta decay and delta decay which occurs when the price of the underlying security drops."
2021-04-07 18:02:42,wallstreetbets,"Starting at the $270 strike all the options there and above went up today, some more than 20%"
2021-04-07 18:02:36,wallstreetbets,"All the otm calls recovered morning losses and then some. Not just 800c. I think the point is that if ANY of these strikes lost money, surely it would be the far otm."

2021-04-07 17:54:47,wallstreetbets,Can‚Äôt it be that only the spread will just be very large? Meaning that bid will stay the same/be lower and only ask will rise? Just guessing ..
2021-04-07 19:56:23,wallstreetbets,Have no clue why the 270 goes green
2021-04-07 17:37:28,wallstreetbets,I take it you're also taking a 800C 4/16 position?

2021-04-07 19:07:47,wallstreetbets,I'm guessing it also has to do with technical analysis presenting signals of an upcoming price swing. Also guessing that more people are just looking to buy those options right now expecting a dip rebound and are willing to pay the premium?

Or buy 2 of a bunch of stocks you think seem good and then watch what happens to your head when they go south and when they spike. How bad do you want to sell on a dump? How hot the fomo burn? Are you willing to take profit?

Lots of ways to trade, including investing. You're gonna have to figure out which one you are built/wired for.

If you have 5k seed money and this is your first dip, then that 5k is tuition. Whatever you do, make sure as shit that it buys you some solid edu so that you have an idea what you want to do with the next 5 when this 5 runs out.

Homey already replied reminding you that this, sir, is a casino. He ain't kidding. There's solid DD in here if you're into scrolling and reading a ton. There's also a ton of CB. These two are not the same. DD let's you fuk, CB gets you fuk.

2021-04-07 18:53:10,wallstreetbets,I had a 401k I split that fucker in half and put it into a ira.  No fees.
2021-04-07 18:14:54,wallstreetbets,Yo I have a question about funding a previous year in an IRA like that. Do you now have to redo your taxes to say that you put money in there or have you not done them yet?
2021-04-07 15:40:04,wallstreetbets,100% diversification is the way ‚úÖ GME STAND UP!

2021-04-07 18:49:42,wallstreetbets,Im at 210 shares and tapped out.  Trying to figure out how to get more cheddar to spread all over this bread.

2021-04-07 19:26:27,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm balls deep in my brokerages but I got 10 big bananas in my new Roth. That fund gonna be 9 figs by the time im an old boomer
2021-04-07 19:26:58,wallstreetbets,Why didn‚Äôt I think of this!!?
2021-04-07 16:35:05,wallstreetbets,"etrade for the 650 position, tdameritrade for the roth IRA"
2021-04-07 18:25:17,wallstreetbets,"2020 IRA funding cutoff is the same time as the tax filing deadline which was extended from 4/15 to 5/15?  In any event, funding an IRA, to my knowledge does not trigger any tax changing event, so the answer to your question should be no.  \*not financial advice and definitely not an accountant, so not tax advice"
2021-04-07 19:40:11,wallstreetbets,You won't be poor in about a month ü§£
2021-04-07 18:33:20,wallstreetbets,"Turns out contributions to a standard IRA are tax deductible but contributions to a Roth IRA are not. So for you, it isn't. If I opened a Roth I could contribute 12k after tax and then it wouldn't be taxed later. A standard IRA will be tased later because it isn't taxed up front."
2021-04-07 18:27:40,wallstreetbets,"Hm. I thought making a contribution to an IRA was tax deductible. I've had ""simple"" tax returns until this year so when I say the following I actually mean it: IDKWTF I'm doing. Gonna have to hire my taxes this year for sure, but I already submitted mine for last year, and so I was avoiding making a contribution to the IRA for 2020 to avoid having to refile"
2021-04-07 18:35:48,wallstreetbets,"sounds right.  for something like full GME holdings, I'd rather buy using post-tax dollars (roth) and not pay taxes on the tail end (assuming price goes up), rather than using pre-tax dollars now with a tax deduction (traditional) then paying tax when I withdraw."
2021-04-07 18:36:10,wallstreetbets,"Making a Roth contribution isn‚Äôt tax deductible, making a traditional IRA contribution, is but only if you make under $76,000 per year (modified AGI)."
2021-04-07 19:39:40,wallstreetbets,"Basically Roth if you think you‚Äôll be wealthier later down the road when you start getting retirement (marginal tax rate would be higher, bad)"
2021-04-07 18:43:11,wallstreetbets,"I should have opened a Roth and had a traditional IRA and a Roth but instead I have a traditional and a normal brokerage account. And if I were to sell my shares, move the money to a Roth then I'd have to pay the capitol gains on it this year. 

Also Roths are only tax free after age 65 so

Edit: Why is this getting downvoted? I get that I got the age wrong but calm tf down"
2021-04-07 15:03:25,wallstreetbets,I own a wee dram of $AMD... Nice trade. Good luck üöÄüåïüôè

2021-04-07 14:45:09,wallstreetbets,Nice play. I'm surprised this post is still up. Usually mods remove AMC posts.
2021-04-07 15:01:41,wallstreetbets,What's your opening basis (per unit cost)?
2021-04-07 16:09:08,wallstreetbets,32K SHEEEEESH.... THATS A DOWNPAYMENT ON A HELLCAT

2021-04-07 15:17:32,wallstreetbets,"Most just happen to break the rules.

Same with most GME posts but there are a lot more of them so more tend to make it through.

Although this one technically breaks a rule too, so we'll see."
2021-04-07 16:21:33,wallstreetbets,To be fair previous Gamestop leadership was terrible as well.
2021-04-07 15:58:34,wallstreetbets,Nope not concerned
2021-04-07 16:29:34,wallstreetbets,Nope
2021-04-07 15:27:59,wallstreetbets,Yeah I know some break the rules but I've seen legit yolo's and losses get taken down fast. It was worse back when the rally first started but it still happens daily.
2021-04-07 15:50:28,wallstreetbets,"nothing against $AMC in particular though. so stop with the conspiracy theory nonsense, pls."

2021-04-07 14:40:19,wallstreetbets,Cracker Barrel is packed all the time now. Ppl done with washing dishes.
2021-04-07 14:58:25,wallstreetbets,No. No. No fucking way. It‚Äôs at an ALL TIME HIGH. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs actually growing. Who the fuck goes to cheesecake?

2021-04-07 14:37:06,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs literally trading near all time high. I‚Äôd go with an airline instead. I am a dumb ape though and this is not financial advice.
2021-04-07 14:43:17,wallstreetbets,What about ü¶ç do they like Cheesecake Factory?
2021-04-07 15:05:12,wallstreetbets,"honestly in the restaurant space, I don't really see the point in buying one of these companies that can't be sold rn/in the near future. (IMO) no one is buying out cheesecake factory at a valuation of 13 million dollars per location. there's so many other distressed/semi beat down restaurants that I'd imagine can be targeted by the goliath sized pocket books. I'd rather try to find one of those c+ QSR's that yum brands is gonna try to gobble up to keep their mediocrity-hegemony intact."
2021-04-07 15:18:07,wallstreetbets,$15 to $60 since March 2020.   Already a 4X move.   Not for me.   Odds favor a larger pullback before advancing again.  It backs up to the mid $40's and I might be interested.

2021-04-07 14:50:39,wallstreetbets,"This is not just another SPAC. Paysafe has got intrinsic value and the investors know what they went into unlike some of the hit-and-run SPACs that have been coming up lately.

The lockup expires July for the biggest investors Blackstone/CVC at earliest. PIPE has no lockup as far as I know.

The wide consensus seems to be that the stock is heavily underpriced, so I'm not worried to be honest."

2021-04-07 17:01:18,wallstreetbets,"Thank you. There‚Äôs absolutely more to be said, these were some quick thoughts and I hope it inspires more people to do their own DDs and share them with us! Fair to say, I like the stock."
2021-04-07 15:57:12,wallstreetbets,I think it‚Äôs more to do with hedge funds shorting SPACs as a whole. Beauty of the shorts are if it moves you get a nice gamma squeeze to maximize gains.
2021-04-07 16:55:59,wallstreetbets,How do you find the data on how much a stock is short?
2021-04-07 14:57:32,wallstreetbets,PSFE makes money though

2021-04-07 16:57:24,wallstreetbets,lol somebody bought calls in january
2021-04-07 16:56:24,wallstreetbets,Based on my 100k loss so far
2021-04-07 18:37:32,wallstreetbets,"I have a lot of July $15c but am going to pick up as much October $15c as I can get if it's still trading sideways on Friday

IV is so low right now that even a small bull run for a few days anytime in the next 2-3 months is going to put the October calls through the roof

I don't think the October $20c are bad but the bang for my buck on the $15c after a few more flat days just makes more sense imo"
2021-04-07 17:09:40,wallstreetbets,Did you buy the top?
2021-04-07 14:00:01,wallstreetbets,"There's a dude that said you spent your life saving 600. I wasn't in a position for a long time to save anything, and a lot of people aren't so there's no need for hate."
2021-04-07 19:34:59,wallstreetbets,"All just my opinion but If what you say is true, you should sell and count yourself lucky that you went all in and made 456% profit.  I‚Äôm not trying to be rude; a lot of people got swept up in this retail trend and have not been so lucky.  You should sell everything and then reinvest your initial $600 and put your gains back in your savings account."

2021-04-07 15:02:41,wallstreetbets,"Some people are dickheads. But some people are also hating on you not because you're poor. They're ""hating"" because you're poor and gambling with the little you have. It's awesome this turned the correct direction for you. But look at the person commenting ""flip him off from your Lambo one day."" These internet strangers are not your friends. It just encourages you to engage in more risky bets that you obviously don't have the capital to sustainably make. 

Of course things could go great, but chances are, it won't. It sucks that things are not great out there, and it may seem like there aren't any options (heh). But PLEASE take the criticism with some thought. Should you really even be spending your time here if your financial situation is so dismal? Could there possibly be something else that you can spend your time on other than a hobby that is almost guaranteed to lose you money?"

2021-04-07 14:24:23,wallstreetbets,90% of my portfolio is in APHA/TLRY. Next few months should be good
2021-04-07 14:15:20,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs okay brother! I‚Äôm down 13% on 25 shares!

But it‚Äôs okay! The Merger on April 16th will set TLRY up to be the most efficient cannabis company with license across the EU and Canada. They‚Äôve secured a strong foothold in the EU Market, and just waiting to attack the American Market

This seems like a $100 stock!!! At this price I‚Äôll be buying more !!!! :) not financial advise please do DD like I have. But I believe üíéü§≤üèª"

2021-04-07 14:02:48,wallstreetbets,It seems to be down due to the expected net revenue loss on Aphiras side. But its still a long game considering once the merger is done they will be the biggest MJ company publicly traded. Any clues on when the actual merger is supposed to happen? I know its already confirmed and rules set for it just not sure on the date.
2021-04-07 14:31:17,wallstreetbets,üöÄüíéü§≤üèª
2021-04-07 15:33:31,wallstreetbets,The shareholder vote for the merger is April 16th.  The actual merger doesn't have a date yet.
2021-04-07 15:04:14,wallstreetbets,I believe
2021-04-07 14:09:12,wallstreetbets,16.4.2021
2021-04-07 15:06:20,wallstreetbets,"Assuming the company to company stuff gets finished pretty quickly after next week's votes, I'd say it'll take till June at least to get regulatory approvals in all the different jurisdictions (countries) they operate in. Aphria in particular, doesn't want to file its annual report until after the merger, so I'd say July at the latest."
2021-04-07 15:41:57,wallstreetbets,"But the 16th is when we start getting information on the merger. If things go well, many people will be wanting to buy TLRY and the price will get a good jump. üíéü§≤üèª"

2021-04-07 15:32:38,wallstreetbets,"That's the date of the shareholder vote, not the actual merger."
2021-04-07 17:24:56,wallstreetbets,"I've been investing in APHA + TLRY for years, so I hope it goes up!  However, I don't think they have a chance in the US market.  There's already several very well established US companies that are ready to go and selling in multiple states.  I don't see how Tilray can get into the US market in any major way unless US allows importing of Canadian products, and even then they have a huge battle against the already established US companies.

That said, APHA is still one of my largest positions and I'm still buying more.  But, I'm also buying into the big US companies too."

2021-04-07 16:42:07,wallstreetbets,Sometimes selling options do move against you but if the company is solid then you‚Äôll hopefully recover by running the wheel or just waiting it out. Or buy and hold like a boring boomer.

2021-04-07 16:49:01,wallstreetbets,"But, if you sell a put  - to get in low...(Or just make money there.)

Then, sell a covered call(s) at a strike price higher than you entered at(Looking at you, SNDL)... With the premiums you collect and selling above the price you got in if you get assigned your covered call...

Isn't that a 0 risk strategy?~

As a bonus, SNDL calls have to be bought at $5 minimum due to the stock price - At least on the platforms I use.(WeBull/Robinhood.)

2021-04-07 17:10:51,wallstreetbets,"In a perfect world, Yeah.

However, if you're me, the underlying keeps plummeting past your put price after you're assigned. Then you wait a week to sell a covered call because your strike price pays like .11 because it's so far away and the underlying keeps falling. So then you panic and sell a covered call a few bucks under your buy-in price because you just want a few sheckles to start working yourself out of the hole you dug yourself into and the stock has shown no signs of at least trading sideways, let alone go up. And lo-and-be-hold if thats not the week the mother fucker moons and you just get to watch your baby taking off in all green and you don't get any of the profits. 

MARA."

2021-04-07 13:21:28,wallstreetbets,Again I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt have money
2021-04-07 14:11:39,wallstreetbets,"well if you want my legitimate opinion...

""rates rise"" this needs way more context and grounding. for those of us that were alive before the 90s, we remember days when 9-10% was a great mortgage rate. I don't see rates going above 3% anytime soon and long-term I think they stay at near-zero, particularly for qualified buyers. money is not hard to buy anymore for qualified debtors. it has been incredibly cheap for a decade now, I highly doubt that cycle breaks in my lifetime barring the complete collapse of the US dollar.

so I contest that the cost of borrowing money will remain insanely cheap for the upper-middle class for years/decades to come. the difference between a sub 2 rate and a sub 3 rate is not significant to me. I'll care when we get closer to 10

Real Estate will _forever_ be the most tax-advantaged asset class in the US. I hope simpletons understand this by now.

Combine these with the realisms of buying/selling homes today. There has been a multi-year shift away from conglomerate lenders because:

1. they take way longer to close deals

2. they don't actually _know_ values of a locale because they send appraisers from bumblefuck, USA

3. they don't give a fuck about relationships and do not compete on price when compared to local lenders/brokers

3 is why the legacy lending model of bulge bracket banks is no longer sustainable

2 is why consumers shift to local brokers

1 is why UWM is competitively MAGNITUDES ahead of competitors. They can close in less than 2 weeks

UWM also has the hard numbers/earnings to back up their growth and product demand. The market hasn't necessarily caught up with this (see the 6x earnings multiple) but I can wait that out easily. 

Unlike you retards, I am a functioning adult with a career that understands the industries I pick. I'm not worried at all

e: oh I totally forgot the incredible amount of churn subsequent to the urban exodus already taking place. the housing market has never been hotter than it is today"

2021-04-07 14:04:34,wallstreetbets,"Some good things going for it. Format is nice and clean. Can buy stocks in multiple markets. They submit your tax bill directly to the government. 

But yeah the hefty commissions are the big drawback. They apparently didn‚Äôt get the memo on commission free trading from the US brokers."
2021-04-07 16:36:30,wallstreetbets,I diversified as well. I‚Äôm YOLO‚Äôd in GME and AMC.

2021-04-07 16:31:44,wallstreetbets,Yeah can't fault that
2021-04-07 18:25:03,wallstreetbets,"The broker isn't the one that submits your tax form for you, its the account type ISK, which you can open up with any broker or bank.

Commissions are not big at all? It's 0.25%, and it's definitely worth it. Customer service is great and they're super legit. Not like the commissions free trading platforms in the US have gotten the best rap lately. It's become very clear what commissions free really means"
2021-04-07 14:06:19,wallstreetbets,Well nothing is free anyways. Probably saves y‚Äôall money in the long run because it makes you think twice about the play you‚Äôre getting into.
2021-04-07 19:36:35,wallstreetbets,"Honestly GME is volatile enough that commissions shouldn't be a major factor in your total P&L, anyway"

2021-04-07 17:22:55,wallstreetbets,NOK has got to be upset.
2021-04-07 17:05:24,wallstreetbets,AMC has nothing to do with fundamentals. The management is terrible and looks like they only care about milking the cow until it gets put out to pasture. It‚Äôs like a private equity firm has already bought them out. It‚Äôs solely a short squeeze play. So when/ if it goes off it will be fast and furious as people bail with modest gains.
2021-04-07 15:00:47,wallstreetbets,I like crayons and GME

2021-04-07 15:53:35,wallstreetbets,"Look at their P&L the last 3 years. Even the last 5 years- Covid obviously impacted their industry, but they have been running negative for so long. It's a dying industry- instead of being proactive and doing the bare minimum of closing your worse cinemas, they give a bonus to the CEO equivalent to what some of their worse cinemas are generating for revenue. Not only that, instead of using these catalyst to their advantage such as GME, they have made no changes. They have made absolutely zero changes to their board members, so essentially they are running the same operation after a bombshell like Covid- an operation already failing. 

I am a believer that AMC could squeeze and it should. But you are constantly working against a team of executives who give a shit if AMC survives. Why would you if you could be absolutely failing and gey a 2 million dollar bonus.

All you need to do is sell in the money Apple calls on margin, once the premium hits your account you will be given more margin and will be able to sell more calls. Keep doing that until you have reached your risk tolerance.  Then buy apple puts with expiry right after their earnings report and live stream market open on day of expiry and finally you have say to say, ‚Äúguh,‚Äù and have a look like you will never fuck again.

If you want to make money with options though, I don‚Äôt know. I just buy low and sell high and never hodl."

2021-04-07 14:36:23,wallstreetbets,"WSB douchebagery aside, I agree in principle, but it‚Äôs not happening for RKT for a variety of reasons. If RKT has a higher earnings report I think it could break this deadlock it‚Äôs in of reliably consistent ups and downs where it hovers at the same price. If they post lower than expected returns it will spiral all over the place some more. 

Right now, at its current price, I think it‚Äôs found it‚Äôs fair value based on what people are willing to pay. It‚Äôs trading at 13x earnings and that is remarkably average. There isn‚Äôt much reason for it to trade higher because it‚Äôs unlikely the housing market is going to remain as hot as it was during covid. 

Also, hopefully it will pop to 24-26 on Monday. The puts get cheaper and I love watching options slide ITW with a nice theta."

Other than that, only buy one new video game a month and slow down on eating out and buying junk you don‚Äôt need. It‚Äôs not too hard to save even when you‚Äôre only making $10-$15/hour so long as you‚Äôre not absolutely paycheck to paycheck. Hell I bought a house when I was making $9 and hour. It‚Äôs not impossible, and if it is, you need to move. You‚Äôre being priced out of the area you live in and you need to relocate somewhere that your job/lack of and the housing market are more in line. Is that the advice I‚Äôd give. My mortgage is about $400 a month for a three bed two bath. It‚Äôs like 1600 square-foot on paper but the attic is finished and not counted, as well as all the storage in the shed and basement. People seem to think they‚Äôre stuck, you can move with next to nothing and stay at a shelter for 60 days or get an apartment for a couple months while looking for a cheap place. There was just a house/duplex for sale down the street a few months ago for $15,000 (it needs a ton of work, but if you can flip it there‚Äôs so much profit there)"

It would just be smarter to have the take off w more help on our side. They want us to win they really do but chess wise we can get more middle/ lower income class into this to cause a better lift off at a decent price. For those tht cant afford it right now.

2021-04-07 19:26:17,wallstreetbets,"Rent.

I lost my apartment in 2018, retired parents let me live at home rent free. Pandemic hits and well, still living at home rent free. Father insist I invest as much as I can. 

My savings for the decade I lived on my own after High School? $-3,000.

1 Pandemic at home? Roughly $15,000 invested turned into $38,000, and about $19,000 in debt paid off (medical bills, paid off car, paid off credit card debt from losing job in 2008)

Rent costs are fucking destoying people. I paid 80%+ of my income on rent alone. Its no wonder I couldn‚Äôt save any fucking money, the system is setup to take most of it. I couldn‚Äôt afford a fucking car till I was 28, just because the initial cost, maintainence, and gas costs would have made me homeless; even a junk shit beater car. I had $20 if I was lucky at the end of the month after paying rent and bills."
2021-04-07 18:39:25,wallstreetbets,I managed to accrue 10k in just a year or two by putting 200 a month into safe stocks.  That‚Äôs just $7 a day.  Lots of people pay more than that for coffee and restaurant meals.

(Recycle? Environmentally friendly? Sustainable? Are these words that a certain political party would love to hear?)

\-CLF (company that produces steel) has been on a rip.

\-Railroad companies have been on a rip lately. Railroad industry uses hella steel!

(TIP FOR THE DAY) For those who do not know what the fuck a standard deviation is (this is for the smooth brains) basically the stock volume is trading outside of where 95% of the volume should occur on average (2 standard deviations is where 95% of the volume should occur). Means someone with fat wads of cash is buying. Please for the love of god if you do not know what standard deviation is look it up. Learning is good for apes.

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Gamma Squeeze on VIAC because of HF failure. Ok so I have been in VIAC for a while before this whole crap show of a dip. Never played it for squeezing. When the dip came I went to work and charted the crap out of it and forecasted a bottom at $40 (we hit $39.81 before moving positive). Check. Start recovey. Price target $60 and $75 YE.

Now while talking with my fellow apes about price predictions this week and future forecasts I decided to take a look at the options chain and noticed something pretty great.

RSI is oversold territory right now with the price increasing on the daily candle. Stoch RSI poised for uptrend and MACD momentum shifting. We are entering an uptrend. Again supporting that $40 bottom and new (technically 2020) trend channel.

VIAC closes above $45 by WE easily and apx 61k calls are ITM, apx $270.1M. We are already there.

VIAC can close a very doable price of just above $49 Friday now 150.1k calls are ITM or $676.26m.

This quite literally puts all the calls ITM and all the puts OOTM Friday.

This pattern of calls continues until June 18th. With most calls in the same window. With VIAC holding $50 before weeks end we may be looking at a Gamma Squeeze coupled with fomo rocketing it back up to it's former price point, then repeating all month. There is also some borrowed shorts in there that would get screwed as a nice icing on the cake.

***EDIT*** wish I could post the picture maybe I'll have to photo bucket it. BUT

Right now VIAC is trading in the same channel it entered in May 2020 before the run up this year. It's a more stable  trendline than the path it was on before the dip. It's been in this channel 84% of the time in the last 14 months. It's at a more stable price than it's been at Feb.

**Edit*** pictures added

***Edit***

Add some explanation to the chart. Ignore the studies those are for my daily scalp and swings/TA I'm not pulling them lol.

Watch the channel trends.

The big ass red line is the downward is the trend that started in 2014. VIAC literally was at the end of a down wards triangle on the 1mo/ yearly chart and breaking out and up. I used that trend line with the 2020 trend channel to find the 2021 breakout.

I then used those with the descending channel (not shown) and a deviation (other yellow channel)to find the stoping point of $40 which I ended up being about 20 cents off.

This now has us in the 2020 channel again perfectly ready to bust, looking to use the deviation channel as that point of turn.


**Edit** ok I removed my studies. You can see the blue 2020 trendline that we are in pretty solid right now previously talked about, and the other channels (less the latest down channel) used to chart the course.[VIAC Trend 1Mo candle](https://app.photobucket.com/u/lk-twoonefive/a/f66e1f19-2aee-4fcb-acb9-1c2880488adc/p/6ca3e0c5-d5ac-4c5b-9185-7c6ea8de71e0)

Price is a bit lower today but right in the expected channel. Testing the bottom several times. This is that blue trend channel from 2020. The yellow overlaid channel now the 2021 offset.

2021-04-07 16:17:18,wallstreetbets,"Picked up 30 VIAC 6/18 $45c earlier today.  Spent much of the day in the money before selling off in the late afternoon.  This is an earnings play  as VIAC is expected to beat earnings estimates handily so I'm not really worried about the short-term fluctuation.  Thinking about adding another 20 contracts tomorrow depending on the price movement.

POSITION:  [30 June 18 $45 calls](https://i.imgur.com/BdIRiZm.png)"
2021-04-07 12:22:54,wallstreetbets,"And they just picked up an outperform rating earlier today.  

https://www.thestreet.com/investing/viacomcbs-upgraded-to-ouperform-by-wolfe-research

POS: 4/30-5/21-6/18 30-60"
2021-04-07 11:46:49,wallstreetbets,"Yahoo Finance has institutional ownership at 92% of float as of Dec 30, which is obviously out of date but with this big dip I feel like they'd have loaded back up after all their stop losses triggered and the price bottomed. With that much institutional ownership, wouldn't you think they'd already have the shares to cover the calls?"
2021-04-07 14:53:23,wallstreetbets,"I bought some shares not because of any squeeze, but I like buying battered stocks... especially when the company itself seems ok. Don't expect short gains, but once things blow over probably will be glad I bought some."
2021-04-07 10:32:58,wallstreetbets,"Isn‚Äôt a GS caused be the opening of call contracts, not the underlying price movement against existing contracts? So I would ask who is buying all the call options. Or are you counting on dealers who didn‚Äôt hedge forced to buy shares?"
2021-04-07 10:31:38,wallstreetbets,So buy options call for every friday until june?
2021-04-07 13:23:32,wallstreetbets,80@43.90
2021-04-07 12:27:02,wallstreetbets,I like the stock
2021-04-07 15:54:16,wallstreetbets,I am Bill Hwang and I also like Viacom.
2021-04-07 12:37:18,wallstreetbets,"Now that GME happened everyone is looking for squeezes but it doesn‚Äôt happen like that. 

That said I‚Äôm in!!"
2021-04-07 10:35:00,wallstreetbets,"Totally agree $VIAC is heavily shorted, I have most of my account in the stock so have been watching the price action closely. Up until yesterday, there were people like Nathan Michaud from Investors Underground shorting it. Which, if you ask me is extremely risky lol. These price movements are pretty wild given the heavy short and open interest."
2021-04-07 12:33:19,wallstreetbets,I would suggest looking at VIACA as the way to play this. Use DISCB vs DISCA as a reference for the float dynamic differences that makes playing the VIACA shares more compelling imo.
2021-04-07 14:53:15,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm in as well. This seems like a prime opportunity for a nice bounce back
2021-04-07 16:08:31,wallstreetbets,"So for April 16 calls, there was about 12k in volume for $50 calls and 15k volume for $45 calls. Way more volume than anywhere else in VIAC. This could be the beginning of a gamma squeeze, or at least a lot of investors are agreeing on the same strategy. RSI is chilling around 30 too. Either way it‚Äôll be interesting to see how the next week and a half plays out"
2021-04-07 16:44:45,wallstreetbets,"always nice to get confirmation bias after throwing a chunk of $$ at a stock! trying to make up for the tendies i missed out on last year when I bought VIAC for \~15.50 and sold it @ \~30

500 @ 45.69 here, and may avg down more tomorrow if we get a jpow dip...let's roll"
2021-04-07 17:04:32,wallstreetbets,"Plus it‚Äôs trading at just an 11.5 P/E ratio, so that puts a floor under the price. You‚Äôre not buying into something that‚Äôs overpriced"
2021-04-07 10:27:59,wallstreetbets,Its down 46% this aint a aqueeze or am i missing something.
2021-04-07 12:22:02,wallstreetbets,"Just came across my desk

https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/news/2021/04/07/viac-moves-higher-following-lofty-analyst-upgrade

More analysts s putting VIAC in that $60 PT range today."
2021-04-07 11:15:17,wallstreetbets,YAAS!
2021-04-07 13:28:04,wallstreetbets,VIACA OR VIACB?
2021-04-07 13:42:56,wallstreetbets,I'm convinced. I'm in.
2021-04-07 13:46:33,wallstreetbets,Bought in yesterday after reading up on it over the weekend.  I'm bullish long and short term on this one.  Picked up some 4/16 50c and 1/21/22 75c
2021-04-07 14:37:22,wallstreetbets,"Bought 6 shares after looking at this, I thought all the archegos deals were gone already. Thanks!"
2021-04-07 14:46:45,wallstreetbets,just bought 5 jan 21 2022 calls for 70. long term printer needs ink.
2021-04-07 14:59:18,wallstreetbets,Anyone who exercises ITM calls are morons and likes throwing money away.  Especially on options with high IV.  Change my mind.
2021-04-07 15:32:18,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm in for 3 5/21 $60C
2021-04-07 15:44:22,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs a lot of lines
2021-04-07 16:11:46,wallstreetbets,"That photo though, lol. Needs more crayons"
2021-04-07 17:09:24,wallstreetbets,"Today was painful to watch. Averaged down a bit on my 4/16 calls. Still hoping for a take-off to at least 47 EOW, but maybe I'm not so smart after all. Thinking about buying May/June calls.

I really hope they are not tricking us into buying this shit. JPM buying millions of shares from CS yesterday morning seems to have created a lot of optimism, but it may as well be a trap, and the stock will get stuck at 42-43."
2021-04-07 11:46:49,wallstreetbets,"We don't even know if the funds are done selling off viac. Super risky to buy in now, even with the big dip. If it weren't risky it'd already have rebounded fully"
2021-04-07 12:32:12,wallstreetbets,"As soon as my AMC puts stop printing, I'm headed your way ‚¨ÜÔ∏è"
2021-04-07 14:45:51,wallstreetbets,Isn‚Äôt ViacA the better play here. Same reason why discb mooned instead of disca. Because of the additional right to vote you get ?
2021-04-07 10:40:46,wallstreetbets,"The powers that be won't allow all of those contracts to expire ITM. They will manipulate the price and I guarantee that for the above reason expiring ITM will screw them over, we should play the opposite side."
2021-04-07 12:36:27,wallstreetbets,Not everything is a squeeze
2021-04-07 12:32:42,wallstreetbets,"You're using technical analysis on a stock that is going down purely because of a HF that is being liquidated? 

RSI, moving averages, MACD- they could all be pointing to a buy until one big ass bank decides to unwind some more bags left over from the liquidation.  

There is no ""feeling"" or sentiment involved here. Your TA will get fucking simply because of the billions upon billions of dollars worth of stock positions that are being unloaded by banks- regardless of the price of the stock or its TA. 

I like most of the stocks that are being absolutely yeeted into oblivion, and it pisses me off that only the banks will know when the liquidation is over and will buy up every stock, leaving us without tendies."
2021-04-07 10:27:12,wallstreetbets,GM?E??
2021-04-07 10:28:09,wallstreetbets,Amc gme go brrrrrr üöÄüöÄ
2021-04-07 12:24:14,wallstreetbets,Picture doesn't load.
2021-04-07 12:58:45,wallstreetbets,"Got in today, before I saw this post. Good confirmation bias but regardless this one gonna bounce back in the coming weeks. I see it as a solid play even if it dips more unexpectedly."
2021-04-07 14:56:00,wallstreetbets,Is there a possibility it will see a recovery like DISCB?
2021-04-07 14:58:53,wallstreetbets,Loaded up $65c LEAPS. Ready for the ride
2021-04-07 17:27:09,wallstreetbets,but how do you know that the calls aren‚Äôt already covered
2021-04-07 11:32:13,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt think so. The archegos fallout is still ongoing.
2021-04-07 12:56:33,wallstreetbets,Bought more VIAC today on this market dip.
2021-04-07 11:02:42,wallstreetbets,Lol your welcome?
2021-04-07 14:22:09,wallstreetbets,5/21 $70C :‚Äô)
2021-04-07 11:34:21,wallstreetbets,How much did you get those a piece bro?
2021-04-07 12:24:11,wallstreetbets,Yep 12 more analysts jumped on the $60ish PT zone today
2021-04-07 12:21:25,wallstreetbets,The data is too old to build upon. The stock was in its peak and the may have sold since then. You need updated data to make conclusions.
2021-04-07 10:45:24,wallstreetbets,"From What I can see, lots of retail betting on call options right now."
2021-04-07 10:35:55,wallstreetbets,"That's the spiral, favorable call expirations and higher prices leads to more open contracts at higher strikes."
2021-04-07 13:08:06,wallstreetbets,"No, price movements affect gamma. If you have lots of open positions, both puts and calls, and the stock price moves the market makers selling those options have to re-hedge those positions. So if a ton of calls are open and the price begins to move up they will have to buy stock to delta-gamma hedge those contracts."
2021-04-07 10:53:46,wallstreetbets,this!  ape speak - viac is noise ... today is shortie pullback day...  or is it????
2021-04-07 10:39:14,wallstreetbets,But as price goes up calls expire good this calls at higher strikes are going to like in. So if you want to buy strikes at $40 now it's discounted Stock imho. But RN trying to push price.
2021-04-07 10:32:53,wallstreetbets,I'm buying and holding shares trying to keep that price over $45 and over $50 by Friday to start this snowball.
2021-04-07 16:24:28,wallstreetbets,75 @ 44.10 you did better than me.
2021-04-07 12:41:25,wallstreetbets,"Lol right. Wasn't looking for it, just bam... and was like heck... This has a chance to close a lot of calls ITM, and start that call frenzy in following weeks."
2021-04-07 12:37:57,wallstreetbets,Michaud is a fucking imbecile. You're better off asking your drug dealer for stock tips. The short trade is over.
2021-04-07 10:37:25,wallstreetbets,There is 102m short positions and 10m SSA. Looking at what I can see there is about 1.6m borrowed shorts. Those kick in after a gamma squeeze jacks the price.
2021-04-07 12:50:08,wallstreetbets,Can you explain
2021-04-07 16:13:01,wallstreetbets,"Yes the trend channel we are in(blue channel in the picture) I know it's hard to see has a low of $42.92 and a high of $48.78.

Closing above that puts good pressure on the price to Squeeze at over $50 on the 16th. But $48.78 is close enough that $50 is possible by close of business this friday. And if that happens it goes now. Then my theory is it continues next week and the next and the next as those options like you pointed out are in that window where over $50 puts literally billions of dollars ITM."
2021-04-07 16:53:20,wallstreetbets,It may dip a bit to around $42.30 but I think that's it
2021-04-07 17:05:53,wallstreetbets,Gotta love the safety net
2021-04-07 10:30:48,wallstreetbets,It's not a short Squeeze. It's a gamma squeeze. Triggered by call options. @$49 strike all the calls are ITM totalling about $676.2m in shares  @$45 strike $270.1m in shares. These strike prices replicate to June 18th.
2021-04-07 19:49:52,wallstreetbets,"Wait, you came on your desk?"
2021-04-07 13:29:40,wallstreetbets,ticker is VIAC.. it's the class B shares
2021-04-07 13:51:46,wallstreetbets,Those 1/21 calls had a nice premium.
2021-04-07 15:57:46,wallstreetbets,Me too but I‚Äôm a little concerned lol
2021-04-07 16:13:59,wallstreetbets,Yea my chart studies overlaid with my drawings looks like shit but it's organized chaos.
2021-04-07 17:11:11,wallstreetbets,"It's a red market day, I think it held well. Powell speech tomorrow."
2021-04-07 12:36:39,wallstreetbets,"We have a pretty good idea. Sum up the amount of volume over the past week and the amount of shares held by known Archegos counter parties (Goldman, Morgan, Credit suissez, Nomura). Based on public info, we know the first three are already out, and we can speculate about Nomura.

Is it risky? Ya, of course. But this type of fire sale forced selling doesn't happen often, and people shorted the fuck out of the company to punish the sellers even more, so it's reasonable to think a strong rebound occurs once everyone knows that everyone knows the forced selling is basically done.

See DISCB as a case study, and why I am playing VIACA."
2021-04-07 11:53:40,wallstreetbets,"We wont know when the HFs are done unwinding positions until it is already complete and $VIAC bounces off the lows. 

Spread out buys, mix shares with options and sell the closer dated options at set date/gain/loss to keep pushing them out. Have an exit strategy. 

Definitiion of exit strategy - sort of like a courtesy tap, except for investing."
2021-04-07 11:59:15,wallstreetbets,Right now VIAC is trading in the same channel it entered in May 2020 before the run up this year. It's a more stable  trendline than the path it was on before the dip. It's been in this channel 84% of the time in the last 14 months. It's at a more stable price than it's been at Feb.
2021-04-07 12:27:53,wallstreetbets,"Ducks are just feeding the selloff, tbh I think it might be an attempted distraction to tie up funds that could be used to go-to the moon. But that's all conspiracy talk."
2021-04-07 10:45:59,wallstreetbets,That's why you should buy long/ calls:)
2021-04-07 11:47:25,wallstreetbets,"Short term, I agree 100%. I'm not expecting > $47 until about mid april. The financials are strong, so I'm investing for the time after that.

I have bought a lot of leap calls. If it stays in the $40s by the time my next paycheck hits, I plan on buying more."
2021-04-07 12:52:23,wallstreetbets,"Just like on GME, have you consider they own the Calls as well?"
2021-04-07 12:40:06,wallstreetbets,"Nope not everything is. But if you read my position and can post why a gamma squeeze couldn't happen I would be happy to hear. FYI. First thing I said after the title is I've been riding VIAC all year taking profit.

PT is $60.

$50 starts the call option frenzy I believe is needed for a gamma Squeeze on this stock."
2021-04-07 12:41:06,wallstreetbets,"And you are using stale information and assuming no one else is aware of the large forced sellers that came to the market over the past week. It's known, and the majority of the shares have been absorbed. Look at the trailing week volume...about 25% of the cap traded yesterday alone."
2021-04-07 12:25:52,wallstreetbets,Damn sorry I tried lol
2021-04-07 12:27:28,wallstreetbets,Try again
2021-04-07 13:12:56,wallstreetbets,Solid PT of $60 is still 11% return
2021-04-07 17:28:03,wallstreetbets,"That's the gamble, welcome to the casino."
2021-04-07 11:36:48,wallstreetbets,didn't they stated selling is completed?
2021-04-07 14:14:35,wallstreetbets,is VIACA no good?
2021-04-07 13:56:04,wallstreetbets,I bought some viacp for the same reason
2021-04-07 18:59:32,wallstreetbets,You're doing it wrong. I bought more VIAC today at the PEAK!
2021-04-07 11:07:26,wallstreetbets,"It needs the attention of the mass of retail investment available. I think there is a lot of people who have noticed this potential, it just needs the call to arms. The company is solid. So it's notike your squeezing something that has potential massive downside on the other end like AMC."
2021-04-07 17:17:04,wallstreetbets,"RemindMe! May 5, 2021"
2021-04-07 17:18:33,wallstreetbets,"RemindMe! May 21, 2021"
2021-04-07 10:40:37,wallstreetbets,"Well I bought the dip on DISCA and VIAC because they are cyclical / rotation plays, but looking at the charts, I do wonder if the YTD price action was essentially a gamma squeeze of sorts because of Archegos CFDs"
2021-04-07 13:13:05,wallstreetbets,I previously had thought that dealers D-G hedged the closer a stock moved to ITM (spot?) because it never made sense to me that a dealer had to buy or sell the underlying stock for every cal or put sold regardless of strike. But then the last GME squeeze happened when someone bought a shit ton of caps in the 600s so I thought I was wrong about that. But maybe that options whale caused actual buying which caused the price to move up and then dealers had to hedge?
2021-04-07 17:22:34,wallstreetbets,70@43.89 - do I win until the $42 crowd pipes up.
2021-04-07 16:10:55,wallstreetbets,[speaking of drug dealers and stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7okje/shout_to_ulampzworldwg22_who_borrowed_money_from/)
2021-04-07 14:04:52,wallstreetbets,LOL he's a polarizing figure. Apparently if you ONLY follow his Twitter and try to follow trades you lack a lot of context and will lose $$. They say if you are in his trading room you get a lot of the specific set ups and things work.
2021-04-07 10:43:05,wallstreetbets,"FWIW, I feel $VIAC also has the right narrative to gain some solid WSB/ Fintwit momentum given the HF failure. Totally the right narrative for big jumps once it gains a bit of traction."
2021-04-07 13:24:08,wallstreetbets,"Check out my two DD posts for more details. I will probably need to do a third because this aspect specifically isn't as well understood as I thought it was. No disrespect to you or anyone else, I just don't have a good feel for what most people know."
2021-04-07 17:06:11,wallstreetbets,Something AMC doesn't have.
2021-04-07 19:51:07,wallstreetbets,I was too excited about VIAC... Unexpected event put a solid company in a position for a squeeze instead of a failing company being shorted to shit... I just couldn't handle it.
2021-04-07 14:26:56,wallstreetbets,thanks I saw them and my ape brain no work
2021-04-07 16:01:01,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt be concerned, I‚Äôm already up $3! Good enough to screenshot, good enough to sell?"
2021-04-07 16:17:49,wallstreetbets,"The big ass red line is the downward trend that started in 2014. VIAC literally was at the end of a down wards triangle on the 1m yearly chart and breaking out and up.I used that trend line with the 2020 trend channel to find the 2021 breakout.

I then used those with the descending channel (not shown) and a deviation (other yellow channel)to find the stoping point of $40 which I ended up being about 20 cents off.

This now has us in the 2020 channel again perfectly ready to bust, looking to use the deviation channel as that point of turn."
2021-04-07 11:59:34,wallstreetbets,I wish I could post a picture of this chart
2021-04-07 12:56:17,wallstreetbets,"Arch's was heavily leveraged into what is believed to be 80-100 billion dollars with a nearly 10:1 leverage.  Viacom's market cap is 25 billion.  

Don't you think insitutions would be gobbling up this once in a lifetime opportunity?"
2021-04-07 12:30:34,wallstreetbets,Works. You may want to take your other pictures private. :)
2021-04-07 17:30:43,wallstreetbets,ima just go all in on 150 calls for june
2021-04-07 15:21:56,wallstreetbets,"essentially, when the banks nuked Archegos, the bulk sold the shares to hedge funds for a discount. Now the HFs are looking to unload their cheaply bought shares for a profit. There is a good chance these shares will enter the market as the price goes up, creating resistance for further price gain."
2021-04-07 12:16:05,wallstreetbets,IDK about you but that's exactly what I would say to let the price rebound before dumping my second half if I needed billions of liquidity.
2021-04-07 11:46:16,wallstreetbets,Idk I‚Äôm looking at the chart now and it looks likes it still in progress. I hesitant to buy calls because wouldn‚Äôt the decay bring the value down? I definitely want to buy some.
2021-04-07 14:50:41,wallstreetbets,"I haven't looked at VIACA yet all my data is on the VIAC ticker. Just got to work but VIACA is leading VIAC, if the options are the same then VIACA is ahead of the game."
2021-04-07 15:54:11,wallstreetbets,"I have a 4:1 ratio in relatively cheap calls for VIAC/VIACA. 
  
Apparently VIACA is more risky bc volume is lower so you'd need to watch it like a hawk so smart/early money doesn't take profits and leave you (us) as bagsters."

2021-04-07 12:13:41,wallstreetbets,"I posted the chart I have you can see the return to the 2020 trend channel further supporting $40 was the bottom. Yea 2021 was a ride, the price is more stable now which makes this options action more viable."
2021-04-07 13:30:41,wallstreetbets,They are selling tons of calls and puts. They don‚Äôt need to hedge each individual option. What they do is take the net delta-gamma exposure of their book and hedge that.

If it's the moving average and studies(I use those for TA and finding entry/exits in scalps and swings) and focus on the channels.

The big ass red line is the downward trend that started in 2014. VIAC literally was at the end of a down wards triangle on the 1mo yearly chart and breaking out and up. I used that trend line with the 2020 trend channel to find the 2021 breakout.

I then used those with the descending channel (not shown) and a deviation (other yellow channel)to find the stoping point of $40 which I ended up being about 20 cents off.

This now has us in the 2020 channel again perfectly ready to bust, looking to use the deviation channel as that point of turn."
2021-04-07 13:21:42,wallstreetbets,"1) you talked right past what I said, 2) look at the volume over the past week. People are indeed gobbling it up. You don't get that much notional trading with a flattish stock with tepid demand."
2021-04-07 12:31:22,wallstreetbets,Lol I'll have to figure that out
2021-04-07 12:32:00,wallstreetbets,"regardless, they have already announced how much they lost. and you also can‚Äôt disagree that at this price, it is indeed attractive."
2021-04-07 12:11:57,wallstreetbets,Posted a link to the chart showing the return to the 2020 channel. $40 was the target bottom. I don't think it's going any lower.
2021-04-07 12:32:42,wallstreetbets,"i believe it‚Äôs down due to the FOMC, and papa powell speaking tomorrow. it‚Äôs a market-wide pull back. so yup"
2021-04-07 17:31:43,wallstreetbets,Yea I just stuck with VIAC
2021-04-07 14:12:58,wallstreetbets,Makes perfect sense
2021-04-07 14:32:50,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't say fraud. I think 99% are bad and don't make good calls. I think maybe 80% are borderline fraudulent. But there is tons of knowledge if you know where to look and use a bit of judgement.
2021-04-07 10:51:33,wallstreetbets,"Totally more potential than AMC! Actually a solid business underneath the hood. Yup I'm holding, these price movements are a bit annoying though. I just don't understand why people keep waiting to buy, they will miss the entry if they try to time it. Itll shoot up on open $5-10 one day in the first 2 minutes."
2021-04-07 18:59:12,wallstreetbets,"So you‚Äôre down ~$15? Don‚Äôt worry too much yet. I was down BIG on my 4/16 $30 ASO calls, and that turned into a nice profit. We still have over 6 weeks to see some positive movement üëçüèº"
2021-04-07 13:25:26,wallstreetbets,"The price ranges seem pretty flat to me ever since the first selloff. They seem to go up significantly one day and then go back to exactly the same price the next. 

They're probably doing controlled sell-offs as to not cause even more panic and once Arch's positions are completely or mostly unwound, then they'll really start eating the shares."
2021-04-07 18:10:17,wallstreetbets,"They can't report official losses until all positions have been closed, sell off is complete! I'm riding with y'all"
2021-04-07 14:50:31,wallstreetbets,Well I‚Äôm holding calls now lol
2021-04-07 12:57:11,wallstreetbets,Yep market wide pull back. I bought the dip. It's starting to come back up a bit now.
2021-04-07 11:03:14,wallstreetbets,Even without a squeeze $60
2021-04-07 19:01:55,wallstreetbets,Yea you are right. It‚Äôs probably not smart to average that call down right?
2021-04-07 13:37:54,wallstreetbets,Prices are up almost 13% since the bottom at $39.81. consolidation at $44-45 is favorable.
2021-04-07 13:29:08,wallstreetbets,"Do you not read the news? And what about that volume, as a % of their cap, and share price clobbering looks like a 'controlled selloff' to you?

Again, you are working with stale information and applying it forward. You need to do more digging."
2021-04-07 19:05:45,wallstreetbets,"I probably won‚Äôt if it continues dropping, but averaging down‚Äôs not a bad idea if you really believe in your pick."
2021-04-07 13:37:42,wallstreetbets,"What news? Has the selloff stopping been officially announced? The volume could literally mean anything, people buying the dumps and other Hedgies buying and dumping. A lot of hedgfunds bought at prices that are significantly higher than what they are now (sold to them by Morgan Stanley before anyone knew how much leverage was behind the stocks because Hedges didn't have access to information from the other banks) and it seems reaaaaaally strange that they are not quadrupling down on their shares and using Total Return Swaps and more leverage for these near arbitrage level stocks. 

Have you read the full story on what exactly happened between Morgan Stanley and its Hedge Fund clients, and then the massive selloff that happened after they sold the shares to the hedgies?"
2021-04-07 19:07:19,wallstreetbets,Thanks man and good luck see you on the other side
2021-04-07 13:43:06,wallstreetbets,"I have a Bloomberg in front of me and have been monitoring this story closely, so I've seen every news article linked to Viacom and the known Archegos counter parties over the past week and change. I have the holder list with the known Archegos counter parties flagged with a volume overlay of everyone's exposures as a percentage of the volume traded.  So yeah I think I have a good understanding for what's going on. That doesn't mean my trade will work, but I am fully aware of the setup.

What you just said about MS is pure noise, and anyone who got bagged there had more than enough volume to get out if they wanted. Your comments and observations are very naive and your information is stale. I think we are done here, good luck."
2021-04-07 19:48:43,wallstreetbets,OH SNAP

2021-04-07 15:29:27,wallstreetbets,"I haven't run any tests to see if it's actually true, but I would suspect selling CCs on highly volatile stocks isn't that great in the long run compared to just buying and holding. 

If you're selling short dated calls a small pop will blow past your strike quickly, and if you sell something further out like 3 months, it's the same thing, these stocks sometimes go on ridiculous runs and you'll end up losing out a bunch.

I think a better strategy is selling longer term ITM puts, especially if IV is high, your CB will be lower than just buying the stock right now even if the put you sold ends up ITM, plus they have some good premium  attached.

Example of deep ITM puts:

June 18 27P are selling for \~$5.25, so if the stock stays flat till then your CB will be \~$21.75 or about 5-6% less than the current price, so your break even is quite good."

This isn't a typical WSB bet though. They are super conservative, always have tons of cash on hand, lots of institutional ownership. If they have a downfall, it's that they don't take enough risks. 

That said, there is profit to be had as you can see above. They almost always beat earnings estimates ;)

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Arcimoto ($FUV) valuation compare to other EV companies Arcimoto ($FUV) valuation compared to other EV companies

Arcimoto ($FUV) is currently trading at a slightly under $500M valuation. Many other companies (especially SPACs) with fewer vehicles produced/sold to date and less clear plans to scale have multi-billion dollar valuations. For example, Nikola ($NKLA) $5B, Lordstown ($RIDE) $2B, and Workhorse ($WKHS) $1.7B.

In the last year, Arcimoto produced and sold \~100 vehicles to customers. They are planning to scale production capacity to 50k/year in 2022 in their new factory. Some companies valued over $1B still mainly have drawings and a couple of prototypes.

Arcimoto's produces inexpensive, 3-wheeled vehicles which makes them less of a direct competitor with Tesla ($TSLA). Direct competition from Tesla poses a real risk to the profitability of other EV players long term.

Arcimoto has gained pretty good traction and support from the Tesla community with Gali from Hyperchange on Arcimoto's board, their partnership with Sandy Munro, and Rob Mauer (Tesla Daily podcast) and Ross Gerber disclosing investments in $FUV.

On the other hand, many people are betting against Arcimoto's success with 23.59% of the float sold short as of 3/15 according to Yahoo Finance.

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

It took disney an entire year to go up $84.

How can you believe disney will go up another $100 in the span of 3 months? And that's just the break even price for $280.

Sure if disney goes up, the premiums will go up, it doesn't have to go up to $280+ for you to sell those contracts to profit. But you will be eating that theta decay for the next 3 months hoping the price would increase.

In the end, if disney hovers around $180-200 for the next 3 months, you will have to sell those contracts for a loss or minimal profit. Unless you are planning to wait it out until the deadline? Then those contracts will be expiring worthless since theres basically slim to no chance disney will reach $280.01 for those contracts to be in the money.

Content is a commodity. Just as i hate paying for cable, i am not signing up for everyones streaming services. Espn is politisports i dont care for. 

Disney is worth $30 more per share than before the Rona. That is all Disney plus priced in. Now with parks/cruises re-opening, maybe a short run to $225 for summer travel. 

Then people figure out subscriber numbers are inflated. Why? Verizon gives away subs to disney plus with unlimited plans. Some of these only last 6 months. What is the loss rate on these subs, how many continue, what will a price hike do.

Even Trump caught covid and he had to get the vaccine treatment to cure himself. 

All antivaxxers and anti mask people do their ""research"" on fb and tell other people to do real research.

You want me to also put on the tin foil hat? Ok. Have it your way. Haven't you heard the conspiracy theory that the anti vax movement actually came from russia and china to undermine the health of the american people? They want americans to die more and die faster. And people who are anti mask and anti vax are only spreading the plague further and helping communists break america apart from within.

China was really clever with covid. Not only did they spread it all the way to 50 american states without having to invade us, but they gave us the anti mask movement too. Now instead of americans helping each other survive, we are divided and fighting each other over ""fake news"" while china and russia are laughing at all the americans dying. Who needs to go to war with america when americans are already killing other americans.

I can guarantee you that this shit runs deeper than just yes mask or no mask. China and russia knows americans love their freedom. So the way they started the anti mask movement was by telling us wearing masks takes away our freedom. And *snap* just like that americans took the bait. And it went down hill from there.

You might think I am the sheep of liberals and science lovers and what not. But you are the sheep of the chinese and russians and don't even know it.

2021-04-07 13:18:47,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately TLRY & APHA won‚Äôt feel the reward of the states legalising. They‚Äôre strictly Canadian brands, and for them to work in America would be breaking the law. 
If you want to be a part of this growing American weed market you should be investing in MSO‚Äôs. 
In my opinion TLRY & APHA will be dead stocks as the Canadian market doesn‚Äôt have that much room to grow.

2021-04-07 16:00:22,wallstreetbets,"In a reply to someone talking about states recently legalising weed??? You do realise they‚Äôre talking about America?
These companies benefit absolutely nothing from the expanding American market - the largest cannabis market in the world."
2021-04-07 17:45:40,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for letting me know about the acquisitions, but the cannabis market in America is progressing at too fast of a rate in my opinion. 
These companies are already being dwarfed by the new American counterparts. Ignoring the merger Tilray did 210 million in revenue in 2020 yet Cresco did 476 million. The longer the American legislation protects these American companies like Cresco the bigger they will grow and the Canadian companies will be left behind."
2021-04-07 17:57:31,wallstreetbets,"Prohibition is definitely hurting companies like Tilray and their chances at US entry. The sooner federal legalization happens, the better their odds of market entry will be. The US is definitely already heavily saturated with large cannabis companies, as you pointed out, and I agree that the Canadian market is nearly maxed out. That being said, I‚Äôm bullish on TLRY because of its international presence, such as with Portugal or the UK (*the largest grower of legal cannabis in the world, btw). US legalization would be a nice boost, either by expanding their market or just investor speculation, but I feel that their fundamentals suggest the possibility of a dominate global trade in cannabis.

*edited unclear info"
2021-04-07 18:09:36,wallstreetbets,"Isn‚Äôt it possible though that the ship has sailed? The lack of changes in legislation has enabled these American companies to grow to a size too big for the Canadian companies to compete with. 
The whole of Canada had $2 billion in sales last year. The whole of America had $15 billion+ in sales and some of the people still have no access to cannabis at all. This comes down to the fact that the population of America is ~10x that of Canada. 
US legalisation would not be a ‚Äònice boost‚Äô for these Canadian companies. It would be unlocking the biggest cannabis market in the world. 

These American companies have grown to such a scale now that they actually dwarf the Canadian counterparts. It will be in the interest of the American people to protect their industries too. If you believe in weed and it‚Äôs growth in the future then surely you should invest in American weed companies with 100%+ YoY growth than Canadian ones which are likely to be blocked out from the US for the foreseeable future?"

2021-04-07 10:29:21,wallstreetbets,"No. Anyone holding this stock should sell it immediately. Two quarters ago they made more money selling shares then they did selling weed. **Then a week ago they announced that they are adding an extra 40% to the float in a new raise.** If you want a company to gamble on that will give you huge leverage, look at slang worldwide. They just released their 4th quarter numbers that blow this dogshit stock out of the water and it's currently trading at .32 cents a share. With a MC of 170 million. Compare that to this dog shit company that has a 2.3 billion market cap with the same or worse earnings."
2021-04-07 10:32:14,wallstreetbets,">This stock will be huge when they really start their weed banking.

So it's a weed company that doesn't sell any weed? And you guys this is a good investment."

2021-04-07 10:31:03,wallstreetbets,if he paid $53 for the contract and then $50 to exercise thats $103 for 100 shares. Or $1030 for 1000 shares.
2021-04-07 15:55:46,wallstreetbets,So what you're saying is instead of just buying the shares for 1$ each you're buying calls for 50$ then spending another 50$ to exercise the contract which equals 100$. So you took a couple extras steps to end up exactly where you would have been if you just bought shares.
2021-04-07 12:10:43,wallstreetbets,Sell all 1000 and buy 3000 of slang worldwide or 1500 shares of high tide. Buy a bunch of toothpaste. It will gain more value in 12 months than SNDL.

2021-04-07 11:46:11,wallstreetbets,I wish I could see his face when he realizes he hasn't figured out a way to cut a share price in half
2021-04-07 12:31:33,wallstreetbets,"no no I think he's aware of the premium now but he's not counting that to the share price, so in his mind his break even is .50

2021-04-07 15:14:16,wallstreetbets,"Because your broker isn‚Äôt taking into the cost of the call itself. You spent $100 in total, your break even is $1 not 0.50. 

Think about it. If you truly only spent $0.50 per share you‚Äôd be able to buy calls, exercise, sell the shares for a 50% profit. It would be free money. Everyone isn‚Äôt doing that because it‚Äôs not. You might save 0.01 on the spread but your cost basis is absolutely not 0.50"
2021-04-07 12:34:48,wallstreetbets,the real GUH is buried in the comments
2021-04-07 11:43:19,wallstreetbets,"You pay the strike when you exercise. The call option give you the right but not the obligation to buy the stock at .50. You pay a premium to acquire this right (in this case the premium is ~.50)

If you choose to exercise your right you have to pay the strike (in this case .50) for the shares."

2021-04-07 11:45:14,wallstreetbets,"yes, you are exercising your right to purchase at .50.

You also paid a premium for that option prior to this."

2021-04-07 16:38:20,wallstreetbets,"Bruh. But how much did you buy the option for??? That‚Äôs what he‚Äôs asking. Yeah if you exercise the option at 0.50 strike you only pay 50 dollars. But if the contract premium is 0.51, to buy that option you‚Äôre already paying 51 dollars for that contract. I‚Äôm sure you can do the rest of the math. Maybe not, this is WSB. Yeah your average cost on your 2950 shares say 0.50 because that‚Äôs what you bought the shares at, but it‚Äôs not taking into account the other 0.50 cent per share you spent buying options? Check how much money you spent total, out of your bank account, and how much you have investing. You may be surprised it‚Äôs not that different. Essentially all you did was find a way to have the rare green theme on RH show without making money."
2021-04-07 16:45:02,wallstreetbets,"Calls are not free. $0.50 calls cost $52. So to get the 100 $0.50 shares, you just spent $102.00. 
You could just buy the shares for $102.00
Your account will show that you averaged down, with your $0.50 shares, but it's not the whole story."
2021-04-07 11:52:18,wallstreetbets,Yes I saw that. You are paying $50 for 100 shares. Did you acquire that option for free?
2021-04-07 15:37:27,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately you don't.
2021-04-07 12:03:19,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-07 15:40:23,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-07 12:25:57,wallstreetbets,But you didn't buy at .50. You bought at .50 + premium. So your break even will be the current share price or a few cents higher. So why even do this?
2021-04-07 15:51:48,wallstreetbets,"Hi, ive been following you for the past few weeks. Im not fully understanding this -

You buy a $0.50 Call of 100 shares for $52 currently. The next day, you exercise it and buy it for 50 cents each (100 shares x $0.50 = $50). Total is: $102

Your average cost is $0.50 for 100 shares....and is showing +50% profit....but your Premium doesnt get figured into that?

If i take your Market cost of $2979.21 divided by your# of shares 2950 it equals out to $1.009 per share. The price it is right now. Im not understanding how you are saving like $3 per 100 shares."
2021-04-07 15:51:06,wallstreetbets,You're not factoring in the premium you paid for the contract. You paid 50$ for contract and then another 50$ to excerise the contract. You paid 100$ for 100 shares.
2021-04-07 12:27:54,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-07 16:05:48,wallstreetbets,He's not factoring the cost of buying the contract into his average cost per share. For whatever reason it's not adding up to him. He's not understanding $50(contract)+$50(exercise option)=100$. He thinks because he paid 50$ to excerise the contract that he essentially bought 100shares at half the price simply because he's not factoring in the premium he paid for the contract.
2021-04-07 15:55:56,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-07 12:28:53,wallstreetbets,"Bro forget sundial, I want what you're smoking."
2021-04-07 15:59:31,wallstreetbets,Holy shit! We have a real retard here. Dude you should be king of wsb. When you factor in the cost to buy the contract for 50$ and the cost of exercising the contract for another 50$ for a total of 100$ then you've essentially paid 1$ per share so your average cost per share would be 1$ not .50.
2021-04-07 16:01:41,wallstreetbets,"Your break even is 50 cents....the price drops from $1 down to 55 cents. Your still made 5 cents each right? No, you just lost 45 cents per share. 

The average price, doesnt factor in the premium you paid."

2021-04-07 12:33:57,wallstreetbets,"Brother. The average cost in your shares doesn't take into account the premium you paid for the call options. You need to keep track of that yourself.

I'm so sorry."
2021-04-07 16:12:55,wallstreetbets,Bro then your average isn't .50$ your average is 1.00$ per share because you have to account for the 50$ you paid for the contract. 50+50=100$ which gives you 100 shares. So average price would be 1$ per share.
2021-04-07 16:19:19,wallstreetbets,"I understand your holding them for longer term - But to ""average down"" is giving you a false number. 

You buy 100 shares for $1 each. Average cost = $1. 

You then also buy the 50 cent contract and exercise it. Average cost is 50 cents

Total Average cost will show for 200 shares: $0.75

Now the stock price goes up to $2 and you sell. Your total profit according to your ""Average price"" is (1.25 profit per share, 200 x 1.25) = $250

Actually, your profit is only $200. Your average cost is really $1 each. 

Averaging down like your doing, looks great on paper. But your screwing yourself long term when you go to sell. Your Profit isnt what it actually is."

And dont worry about google/apple making infotainment, a car can use both qnx and infotainment apple/android. You wouldn't want BB handling your entertainment, you wouldn't want google/apple handling anything security wise or critical systems of your vehicle.

Simply put one might play you Taylor Swift Videos, the other is telling your car a critical part got damaged and it needs to push all system resources towards keep the car and brakes working. I wouldn't trust any modern car company not using BB.

As vehicles become more internet connected, security will be important. Dont want your data stolen, dont want your smart car gettng hacked. BB has a big future in this growing sector.

BB has worked with google before btw. If apple wants to get into cars they too will need to work with BB.


IVY with AWS will be increcible too.

Im thinking BB is a possibible target for a potential buyout possible. If a google or AWS bought BB, theyd be undisputed in the vehicle software game. Not to mention there is $ to be made off people's data from their vehicles."

I feel like some of these big brands are cashing in on this.  There's perhaps a perception that hedgies are getting fucked and it's great. 

Hedgies are the bullies who stole your lunch money, not because they needed it to buy food. It was just the thrill of being able to do something and no one could stop them. 

Time's up hedgies.  The people you've fucked over are taking names. 

The apes are uniting and providing an opportunity for the big players to do some shit. It's as if the nerds and the goth kids have formed some kind of weird alliance.  It won't last long, but it's something."

It was talked about in the earnings call. Also they only missed revenue by $30 mil with like $60 mil deferred income (probably from patent negotiations). Otherwise their financials look ok.

Just as a banker does DD on whether a company can repay a loan, WSB did its DD on whether GME can do a turnaround. WSB just managed to do the DD earlier"
2021-04-07 11:51:40,wallstreetbets,"Yea its totally retail hype guys not at all a squeeze caused ny institutional greed.

Its not that hedgies took a risky bet without reasonable stop losses. Its totally bob buying two shares that's causing this to happen. 

The hedgies did nothing wrong Its not their fault they're losing money"
2021-04-07 08:21:34,wallstreetbets,"Funny how they keep banging on about that 3.5m shares(even though it's just an amendment to an existing contract)...going by iborrow, it's like HFs have borrowed that many shares in a typical week. üôàü¶çü¶çü¶ç"

GameStop didnt need a turn around, it needed to shed its skin, so it can grow into something greater"
2021-04-07 08:39:33,wallstreetbets,"They are already sitting on 508M. It doesn‚Äôt mean that the 3.5m shares would be exercised right away. In my opinion, we won‚Äôt even notice that they have exercised these - they‚Äôll sell 20-50k at a time a day (week) throughout the year and keep a reserve of 1M. Just a guess."
2021-04-07 12:41:09,wallstreetbets,Everyone‚Äôs acting like the writing wasn‚Äôt on the wall. Millions of us dumped money into the stock and I‚Äôve even seen fellow apes mention here how they‚Äôd love for Cohen to use the pricing to their advantage to turn the company around. Power to the players.

2021-04-07 10:39:16,wallstreetbets,"The article is correct in stating that the fundamentals of the stock do change if you sell a ton of stock in the midst of a  a short squeeze and raise 500m-1B at valuations that are frankly non-sensical based on any DCF model I've ever seen.  


At $4,  you are pricing in a huge chance of bk.  
Add 700m (or roughly $10/share in cash), and you can handle losing money for a few more years while transforming the business.   


But not sure how the 'transformation' is expected to produce revenue to justify 15B valuation --  newegg is worth <1b,  and it isn't clear that the total profitability  markets that they hope to enter can justify the current market cap.  


So wise for the board to issue shares."

2021-04-07 10:43:23,wallstreetbets,">Funny how they keep banging on about that 3.5m shares

Usually news of stock offering triggers a sell off because of dilution of the shares. People risk seeing the value of their shares go down and so they take their gains/cut their losses before it happens

Maybe they where hoping it would trigger a sell off in GME.

The only thing that I see moving the stock is transparency about the short positions in which case it either clearly shows the stock is massively overshorted or all shorts have been covered as some hedgefunds and every pundit loves to claim. If it's the first a margin call could happen, if it's the second apes will take their gains.

GameStop Stock Mania Is Making Its Turnaround Possible

By Tae Kim

The Reddit-fueled surge in the video-game retailer‚Äôs share price is paying off, helping to raise cash and boost its chance of success.

What a crazy year it‚Äôs been for GameStop Corp. Last April, it was left for dead. Predicting an imminent demise for the retailer, hedge funds piled on their bearish bets and the company‚Äôs market value sank to a few hundred million dollars. A year later, thanks to big buying from the Reddit crowd, GameStop is worth about $13 billion and is now looking to raise as much as $1 billion in capital to fund internet entrepreneur Ryan Cohen‚Äôs turnaround plan. This year‚Äôs GameStop stock mania may make its business transformation possible.

The retail investor frenzy over GameStop shares has been well covered. But the stock‚Äôs rally has some fundamental underpinnings. It is not a coincidence that the surge began days after Cohen was appointed to its board on Jan. 11. Since joining in an official capacity, the co-founder and former chief executive officer of online pet-supply retailer Chewy Inc. has moved quickly, taking control of the company‚Äôs strategy and pivoting it faster toward e-commerce. He has hired nine executives ‚Äî five of whom had experience at Amazon.com Inc. ‚Äî including a new chief operating officer and chief technology officer. Several of the additional hires also came from Chewy, a sign of confidence from former colleagues in COhen‚Äôs abilities. Now, the company is raising the funds needed to implement his plan.

Early Monday, the company announced it will sell as much as 3.5 million shares worth as much as $1 billion in an ‚Äúat-the-market‚Äù stock offering. It said the funds will be used to ‚Äúaccelerate its transformation‚Äù and strengthen its balance sheet. The video-game retailer also announced that its revenue for the five weeks ended April 2 increased by 18% compared with a year earlier, negating a part of the naysayers‚Äô thesis that it is a declining business. While GameStop shares slumped in early trading Monday on news of the share sale, they recovered a bit as the day wore on, pointing to investor optimism for Cohen‚Äôs plan.

 It is a prudent and necessary move. With GameStop‚Äôs share price up nearly 900% this year, the company will be able to raise significantly more funds to expand its e-commerce capabilities. The turnaround plan outlined in its latest annual report includes building fulfillment operations for faster delivery times, overhauling its website and starting a U.S.-based customer service operation. All these initiatives are needed to improve GameStop‚Äôs customer experience and will require significant investments.

 GameStop‚Äôs latest executive hire may tip off even bigger ambitions. Last week, the retailer said it had appointed Elliott Wilke as its chief growth officer. Wilke spent the last seven years in senior roles at Amazon, including stints at Amazon Fresh, Prime Pantry and Worldwide Private Brands. His experience at the e-commerce giant‚Äôs private-label business may mean GameStop intends to some day launch its own branded hardware products such as gaming mice, keyboards and other higher-priced items such as gaming PCs. If successful, this kind of move could generate higher profit margins much the same way as Amazon‚Äôs AmazonBasics and Costco‚Äôs Kirkland Signature product lines.

In another noteworthy development, GameStop has ramped up its offerings in the PC gaming hardware market in recent weeks. The retailer is releasing five-page weekly ad circulars focused on this niche, selling items such as $400 gaming monitors and $1,000 Nvidia graphics cards. PC gaming is a large and growing area and is not cyclical like the retailer‚Äôs core console-gaming market. On the back of its better-known brand, GameStop should be able to take market share from other PC e-commerce players such as Newegg and Micro Center.

In just a few months, Cohen has revamped GameStop‚Äôs senior management, adding executives with the required relevant technology backgrounds, while setting a clear vision for the company‚Äôs future and moving further into attractive product areas. This is an impressive amount of progress in a short time frame. With the coming fund raise, the company will have the capital to fully execute on Cohen‚Äôs vision. The so-called smart money should take notice."

This is very good news."
2021-04-07 10:21:04,wallstreetbets,"TBF, ""as much as"" could mean 0."
2021-04-07 10:40:25,wallstreetbets,"This looks bad on paper but will ultimately play into our hands. They know a squeeze is likely it was outlined in their report, it's still in their best interest to wait until they get the best value for each stock. 3.5 million shares is still a small fraction of what hedgies have to cover. Come on be dumber"
2021-04-07 09:46:36,wallstreetbets,"They will, wtf are you thinking they are doing that for?

They plan to sell at $285 minimum lol

They'd be stupid as fuck for not doing this and honestly if they didn't my trust in their future would be severely limited."
2021-04-07 08:29:31,wallstreetbets,Dude. They will. If they want to turnaround they have to.
2021-04-07 17:23:52,wallstreetbets,"the media doesn't care if they make false or misleading headlines, the news cycle is 24 hours or less.  that way they can ""break"" whatever fucking aligned story they want with minimal consequences.

almost like lending banana's out with no intention of paying them back. wait a second, i see the similarities."
2021-04-07 09:15:19,wallstreetbets,"That's what ""as much as"" means. I suppose you can say it's misleading, but only if the reader doesn't know what ""as much as"" means."
2021-04-07 10:20:18,wallstreetbets,Agree.
2021-04-07 09:15:18,wallstreetbets,"You can't 'not notice' an issuance of new stock, because they have to announce when it happens and how many shares they've added by law, and 'keeping a reserve' doesn't prevent a dilution of earnings per share.  It doesn't matter who holds the 3.5M shares of stock, the earnings per share value of existing shares decreases when there's 3.5M more shares to split earnings with.

The stock price may hold steady or even increase if there's enough buying pressure, but to say that the addition of 3.5M shares would slip under everyone's radar if they created the shares but don't do anything with them or sell them one at a time is being silly."
2021-04-07 09:50:01,wallstreetbets,"I read somewhere because its ATM and a limited sell off, it will really only affect the share price like 20 cents too."
2021-04-07 17:43:36,wallstreetbets,they'll issue shares periodically during the squeeze
2021-04-07 14:18:39,wallstreetbets,"I agree to some extent, but start-up tech companies and delivery companies are priced at simply unreal valuations right now. If Chewy's 33B valuation is justified (when theyve never had a profitable quarter) a 12B valuation for GME is definitely justified."
2021-04-07 16:28:39,wallstreetbets," They're not issueing new shares, they're potentially releasing existing ones"
2021-04-07 16:35:07,wallstreetbets,"Initially I thought like this, but perhaps they plan to unload it slowly on the way to $1000 or on the way to $10k"
2021-04-07 14:21:47,wallstreetbets,"There is significantly more upside to GME than downside at this point, even though you're right and it could fail. GME has revenue similar to Chewy, and while as you mentioned Chewy has never been profitable GME was profitable last quarter. Chewy's market cap is.... about 3X that of Gamestop. As I said, significant upside. Gamestop also has assets like physical inventory so even in liquidation it is worth more than the 7$ a share it was trading for when I first bought."
2021-04-07 11:09:02,wallstreetbets,Walmart for 2. Shall I go on gay bear?
2021-04-07 11:26:29,wallstreetbets,"I don't expect it to be due to the stock ""mania"" but Ryan Cohen who was brought on to the GME team last year turned Chewy from a failing business into an online giant. Not saying he can do it again with gamestop... But that gives me more hope than any stock craziness."

This equation only works if hedgies are short on the other end, creating the scarcity of shares.

2021-04-07 12:23:57,wallstreetbets,"Eventually they‚Äôll be margin called and forced to buy all the shares they owe regardless of it‚Äôs current price.

They owe over 100% of the shares available, meaning they‚Äôll have to buy basically every share that exists, and then some more after that. 

If nobody sells at a low price, that means they‚Äôre forced to buy all the shares that are ready to be bought at $500, $600, $700, etc all the way up in the thousands and potentially hundreds of thousands if they still haven‚Äôt covered their shares and there‚Äôs still shares to buy at those prices.

If they can‚Äôt afford to buy, it‚Äôll tear through their insurance instead, they have trillions of dollars in insurance so it can theoretically afford up to millions per share. 

This is how a short squeeze works. 

If everybody sells at $1000, then they can buy all 70 million shares at $1000 each, then it doesn‚Äôt go higher than that, and that‚Äôs the end of the squeeze. 

If people hold until $10,000 then sell at $10,000, then they‚Äôre forced to buy all the shares at $10,000.

Etc etc, if everybody holds all of their shares till $1,000,000, then they‚Äôre forced to buy at $1,000,000.

The only thing stopping the share price from hitting $1,000,000 is if apes sell at a lower price, that‚Äôs all, so if everyone gets into the mindset of selling at $1,000,000, it can be $1,000,000 per share. 

So... could it hit $1,000,000? Theoretically speaking yes, assuming everybody who holds GME holds it well into the $10,000, $50,000, $100,000, $250,000, $500,000, $750,000 price tags.

How many people here can actually look at their $4,750,000 worth of GME shares and think ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to keep holding‚Äù. How much trust do you have in other people to see those massive numbers in their app and still not sell?

To your second question, it‚Äôs possible for them to keep the price low, like they‚Äôre already doing as we speak, but if nobody sells then there‚Äôs nobody to buy shares from, thus they can‚Äôt cover."

The big bank PBs have much bigger stock loan departments, more shares likely available, and  lower fees to institutional clients than what you see on iborrow. 

The only thing iborrow is good for is looking at the direction of the borrow fees. If borrow fees are low than a squeeze is not coming any time soon."

When a company creates new stock, they very much have to tell everyone that they're making new shares and how many are created, since it affects the holdings of every existing shareholder and it changes the perceived value of each share.

Now there are several titans they must compete against in the digital software market who already have strong footholds and a strong user base (Steam, Epic, GoG, etc.).

Epic only really succeeded in their store by spending insane amounts of money to get exclusives and to essentially give away free games every week to secure new users.

Hedge funds will then buy 50% of those shares that the original owners just sold, then give it to remaining 50% of people they owe. Then that‚Äôs it, the squeeze is over and done with. They‚Äôve successfully bought and returned 120% of the stock, while only using 70% of the actual shares to do so.

2021-04-07 17:28:03,wallstreetbets,"Those boomers that built and bought the House I live in that I paid a 5,000% mark up on since build date and still have the balls to say things like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why you millennials think everything is so hard‚Äù?

Don‚Äôt get me started about college cost lol."
2021-04-07 18:29:58,wallstreetbets,">I like to think its because of how soft people are becoming today,

This is nothing more than a dumb talking point used by boomers to make them feel superior to later generations. The fact is Boomers had the easiest economy for making a living and every successive generation has had it harder. Boomers could graduate from college debt-free simply by working during the summers, and could buy a family house on a single income. I would argue modern generations are much tougher, I know many people who work 60-80 hours a week just to make ends meet. 

Of course, if you simply mean ""Zoomers cancel me for being racist, this generation is too soft."" Then yes, this generation isn't as soft as the boomers."
2021-04-07 17:40:26,wallstreetbets,"LOL I know. We're just a sad bunch of pathetic nobodies. Seriously, I thought we were kinda cool.

2021-04-07 18:23:04,wallstreetbets,"Some part of my subconscious still thinks that it couldn't have been more than 8 or 9 years since Clinton was president, so I understand that feeling.

But that's not the point - it doesn't matter how long it took Amazon to become profitable.  It doesn't matter how long it took Chewy to become profitable.  The point is, simply adding a board member from a successful company is not some kind of panacea that will automatically fix a failing business that's struggled for a decade.  If it was that easy, no business would ever fail.

*Maybe* Gamestop will be the first to actually pull this off, but there's absolutely no reason to think that will be the case - Gamestop has all kinds of looming liabilities and potential problems stemming from decisions made years ago that **never** get mentioned here, and even without those things, still no reason to believe it's found the magic board member who will save the whole show - no reason to think a person like that exists or will ever exist."
2021-04-07 13:28:11,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs the major issue with retail brokerages, their reasoning is that every time they create a limit order, they have to pay out of their pockets to do it, so they don‚Äôt want to waste their money on random people putting ridiculous prices for the fun of it. 

GME is a whole different thing though. But odds are they‚Äôre not going to change that limit order rule just for a few meme stocks.

Like people who tried to buy at $370 and realised they just paid $420 per share instead."

2021-04-07 12:15:31,wallstreetbets,"I'll take a stab at this. Other brokers may borrow shares to fulfill contract obligations, provide liquidity, or cover a shortfall in demand.

Borrowing shares isn't done only for shorting. It's sort of like how you can't use ""short volume"" to indicate how much a stock is short-sold; the name ""short"" doesn't mean borrow-to-sell intrinsically in the stock market."
2021-04-07 12:33:21,wallstreetbets,The availability to borrow could also decrease when the supply decreases. Someone not wanting to lend out their shares anymore or someone selling his shares.

Which I would imagine would trigger the main üöÄ  were all waiting for?

If im understanding this wrong,  please correct me so ill learn. Iv just never read this being asked befor"
2021-04-07 15:13:07,wallstreetbets,I just wanna find out the buy/sell ratio for GME.
2021-04-07 18:41:33,wallstreetbets,Is it  a transaction ratio of volume ratio?  Huge difference.

2021-04-07 12:47:48,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs my point.
2021-04-07 18:35:59,wallstreetbets,"Extremely hard to calculate, there‚Äôs no strict ‚Äúthis date‚Äù to use, they can push back the due date, they can extend the time it takes to cover, for every date they miss they pay fines, and if they don‚Äôt have any more money to pay fines they can continue borrowing money. 

Just have to wait for all of this to burnout before it happens."
2021-04-07 15:30:34,wallstreetbets,"The thing I told you to search for shows the ratio for the most popular stocks. GME is one of them. However that's just Fidelity's ratio. If someone else knows how to see it for the entire market, I'd love to hear how."
2021-04-07 17:58:55,wallstreetbets,"Nah nah. We‚Äôre the current adult age that people think of when they close their eyes. 

But we don‚Äôt get any recognition for it. 

We‚Äôre just dumb lazy millennials living in moms basement.  With our 250,000$ college debt and the quandary of why we can‚Äôt afford anything lol."
2021-04-07 16:34:38,wallstreetbets,"Sorta? Maybe?

It's just normal traffic with stocks, in my estimation. Since we cannot determine whether it's a lend for a short sale, or to cover other broker activities, it's impossible to say. 

I think there are better indicators than the moment-to-moment borrowing and many other ""signs"" that this stock is still heavily shorted, but I'm in GME for a longer-term position."

Then, it is thrust into the heat once more until its very structural integrity is almost literally melting. Its reward for this? It is removed from the flames once more, to be beaten, and hammered all over again.

This process is repeated multiple times. Many more than a layman would guess at or imagine.

It never really occurs to them that they've been saying the same thing since GME cost $38.

Perhaps it is the simple fact that if they had simply bought into GME at that $40 price they would've seen more gains than on any of their other trades and it is just their bitter jealously manifesting itself.

""It has to be over, it has to be"" they think to themself as PLTR drops another percent.

So if they have borrowed 700k plus shares, is this their attempt to drop the value as much as possible?

If we all bought and are holding, they will be able to manipulate the price a lot since there is no one but them trading (that is substantial).

So the lower they are able to manipulate it, that should be taken as a good sign since it means no one but them are selling?"

It's members are mainly banks and brokers. The brokers and banks can apply pressure to their clients (HF) to cover or close out their positions if they don't have liquidity. The DTCC/NSCC do not regulate or control HFs. I say this cause ppl will think that if 801 gets passed that will auto margin call a HF and it won't. It def helps but again it will be up to the NSCC members which do not include HFs. Just continue to buy / hold if you can.

2021-04-07 09:07:30,wallstreetbets," On  this day, April 7th in 1971, a secret team of German and Swedish  engineers attempted a feat only the Americans and Soviets would  accomplish for many decades to come. Details of the mission were finally  declassified 50 years later.

The  mission team for the AFFE-Zw√∂lf was comprised of the two experienced  test pilots Hans Albrecht and Elias H√∂dl as well as two laboratory  chimpanzees, with the goal of beating the Soviets to a possible moon  landing scenario although officially only a moonshot attempt would be  made.

During the mission, there  was a catastrophic failure of the navigation system and Albrecht had to  switch to manual controls while approaching the moon, and was able to  avoid disaster with his keen visual insight to keep the craft 100km  above the lunar surface. However, they would need to reduce the mass of  the orbiter at their altitude to escape the moon's gravity, and Mission  Control advised the two men not to descend to the surface as recovery  would be impossible. They chose to place the chimpanzees into the lander  and detach the module from the orbiter in order to return home to Earth  while the lander made a controlled descent to the moon.

The  two Germanic astronauts made it safely back to Earth, where Mission  Control gave Albrecht the nickname ""Diamant"" for successfully navigating  the damaged AFFE-Zw√∂lf and landing a pair of chimpanzees on the lunar  surface. As it was a secret project which violated the Potsdam agreement  and would have caused tensions with the USA and Russia, information on  the project was only declassified in 2021.

*TL;DR: ""Diamond"" Hans brought the apes to the moon with H√∂dl.*"

So, looking through it.... it's going to force people to have the shares for all types of trading.  Recursive lending, not going to happen.  However, this was, apparently, released for comment on April 1.  (no kidding)  It still has a tremendous amount of strikethroughs and additions.  I don't if it's in a 'final' copy yet.  However, from everything I read it can take 7 to 21 days for this to be implemented.  So, this will be an extra rocket booster once it's put in play somewhere before now and April 30th.

Good luck to us oh ape-ish ones!"

New DTCC rules putting the pressure on. The heat is increasing, the interest is roaring and the pressure cooker will blow when it's ready.

Back to chilling and villaining because when the shit blows, be ready to be villainized by the media. 

Villainized because some retail traders/apes decided to HOLD one overly shorted stock to:

A. Make tons of cheddar 
B. Identify a system with large gaping holes in it's structure, taken advantage of by a small group of people who utilize loopholes to both make money and pay as little taxes as possible.

Oversight and regulation are often decried by libertarians who want as little govt interference as possible, but look at Wall Street, it's about as fair as a high school bball team playing against an NBA team.

I HOLD because I believe in the math and I love the stock."

2021-04-07 11:33:47,wallstreetbets," On   this day, April 7th in 1971, a secret team of German and Swedish   engineers attempted a feat only the Americans and Soviets would   accomplish for many decades to come. Details of the mission were finally   declassified 50 years later.

The  mission team for the AFFE-Zw√∂lf was comprised of the two  experienced  test pilots Hans Albrecht and Elias H√∂dl as well as two  laboratory  chimpanzees, with the goal of beating the Soviets to a  possible moon  landing scenario although officially only a moonshot  attempt would be  made.

During the mission, there  was a catastrophic failure of the  navigation system and Albrecht had to  switch to manual controls while  approaching the moon, and was able to  avoid disaster with his keen  visual insight to keep the craft 100km  above the lunar surface.  However, they would need to reduce the mass of  the orbiter at their  altitude to escape the moon's gravity, and Mission  Control advised the  two men not to descend to the surface as recovery  would be impossible.  They chose to place the chimpanzees into the lander  and detach the  module from the orbiter in order to return home to Earth  while the  lander made a controlled descent to the moon.

The  two Germanic astronauts made it safely back to Earth, where  Mission  Control gave Albrecht the nickname ""Diamant"" for successfully  navigating  the damaged AFFE-Zw√∂lf and landing a pair of chimpanzees on  the lunar  surface. As it was a secret project which violated the  Potsdam agreement  and would have caused tensions with the USA and  Russia, information on  the project was only declassified in 2021.

*TL;DR: ""Diamond"" Hans brought the apes to the moon with H√∂dl.*"

Melvin cap worth- $8-$23b in managed assets

There are a lot of other funds and brokers and banks involved that will be liquidated waaay before it makes it up to the clearing house then clearing house insurance then federal reserve.. but let‚Äôs just run with ONLY those figures for now. So let‚Äôs add that up... roughly $68 trillion

Now Let‚Äôs also start with the HIGHEST number of shares they could have to buy and let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs 1billion shares.. 

So let‚Äôs divide $68,000,000,000,000 by 1,000,000,000 shares.. we get $68,000sp

That‚Äôs not counting all the other hedgefunds shorting this. And yes I know not all of their assets will be liquidated for gme they will have to pay off all other short positions as well.. however.. I think those figures quite plainly show this stock will be going very very high.. MOASS indeed.

At this point the squeeze is very much possible, we are in a very good position. GME already said that they are ready to profit off of it, the bigger the price the lesser shares they have to sell, up to 1 billion in profit is what they aim for.

They have all the arsenal to cause it (reverse split, dividents, news etc). So if the squeeze happens they make money and also they will win a lot of publicity and costumers (the company that beat the shorts and people buying from them just to celebrate).

At this point I see no reason why they wouldn't just give the shorts the final hit and send GME in the thousands, make a quick profit and then proceed further away with the transformation.

2021-04-07 09:34:25,wallstreetbets,"Months After the GameStop Saga, Retail Traders Still Haven't Checked Out -- Barrons.com

Housebound retail traders made a splash in late January, when a group of Reddit users pushed stocks like GameStop(GME) and AMC Entertainment(AMC) through the ceiling. Their increasing participation in the market, especially via speculative options trades, has caused concern that stock trading could be more volatile.

Those market players are still highly active, even though vaccinations are helping restore a semblance of normal life, and stocks keep hitting new highs, likely leaving less space for big gains like those in 2020. Retail trading has receded from the peak seen early in the year, but mom-and-pop investors still remain way more aggressive than they have been over the past two decades.

Small-lot options trades, those involving fewer than than 10 contracts, are often viewed as a measure of retail interest. In the most recent week, small-lot volumes of equity call buying were down by roughly 50% from their peak in late January, wrote Susquehanna analyst Christopher Jacobson in a Monday research note. He cited data from Options Clearing Corp, the world's largest equity-derivatives clearing organization.

That is the lowest level since early November, but the percentage of options volume driven by small-lot trades is still meaningfully higher than it was before the pandemic. The trading activity is also more speculative.

During last week's holiday-shortened stretch, the buying of call options accounted for 47% of volume among the the smallest of traders, wrote SentimenTrader's Jason Goepfert in a Monday note. ""Sure, that's down from 55% in January but it's still higher than any other pre-2020 week in 20 years other than (barely) the peak in 2000,"" he said.

Buying call options gives investors the right to buy shares later at a specified price, giving them a profit should the price rises above the threshold before the contract expires. Buying put options, on the other hand, gives an investor the right to sell at a set price before the contract expires, offering protection in case the market falls below that level.

It doesn't look as if mom-and-pop investors are buying puts as an offset to their purchases of calls, wrote Goepfert. Purchases of calls by small investors exceed buying of puts by far wider margins than during past peaks. The gap is more than double its size in 2000, indicating a highly speculative market, where investors don't have enough protection on the downside.

A high ratio of calls to puts indicates retail investors are bullish on the market or whatever stocks they are betting on. But they could lose the cost of the options if their optimism proves unfounded.

It doesn't look like retail investors are moving to less aggressive strategies, such as selling calls, either. Among trades for 10 contracts or fewer executed last week, 59% more bullish options strategies were executed than bearish ones, according to Goepfert. Prior to the last six months, the only weeks that showed more aggressive behavior among small traders were during the peak of the tech-stock bubble in 2000, in October 2007, and a few weeks in January and February 2020.

""In many respects, small trader behavior is still more aggressive than many of the speculative fervors that popped up over the past 20 years, in the most leveraged instruments,"" wrote Goepfert. The speculative frenzy looks ""troubling,"" he said, raising the potential for losses among small investors, especially because the stock market keeps rising.

The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Monday and slipped 0.1% on Tuesday.

Still, there might be one piece of good news. Many small players have exited positions in many of the stocks pushed highest by the retail frenzy in January as prices have fallen in recent trading. ""There has been more churn in many of the most-exposed names,"" wrote Goepfert, ""So a rotation to more defensive positioning after the latest surge in speculative activity was beneficial.""

It remains to be seen whether the recent pullback in retail participation signifies a lasting decline, or a pause."

it's hard to convince john q public a gme share is actually worth this, and when they do their own research places like FINRA and others don't support your squeeze theory.

They have to go down a really deep hole to believe the FINRA numbers are wrong, especially with how the last squeeze went in January.

so people who believe in the squeeze have bought it, and the rest are just watching the graphs."

How is it that PLTR volume is always so damn high, and yet price movement is so damn flat? I‚Äôm strongly ‚Äúguessing‚Äù it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs an equal amount of buyers and sellers. Is it still the sell off of shares by long time holders, like company execs? The sentiment from retail investors is to buy and hold. So if it‚Äôs not retail doing the selling, and the sell offs aren‚Äôt predominantly still due to company execs and long time shareholder holders....and institutions haven‚Äôt bought in to a massive extent (to sell)...is the flat price movement due to options trading? 

And, Everytime I check, the volume of calls being bought far exceeds puts being bought...wouldn‚Äôt that make the price rise?


What am I missing. Be as much of an asshole as you want but can someone please lmk for real what the deal is? They had two massive new contracts recently. I‚Äôd expect it to go up a little and establish a new baseline, instead of going up slightly just to go back down slightly."

2021-04-07 14:03:56,wallstreetbets,"Some of you seem alright, so here is:

1. Diversify - no more than 20% into one play.
2. Test the waters - average cost down into a position (not always, but do this if not sure about a play).
3. Only play weeklies and 0dte if you know what's up. Otherwise stick to AT LEAST 1 month out expiry, or 2 month - for added safety (though reduced leverage, thus reduced potential gain and loss).
4. Buy ITM or ATM only. OTM options is why you always lose, even if you picked the direction right.
5. This is all just a game. If you're here to solve your financial problems - stop and talk to a professional financial advisor. This is 100% gambling. It's possible to get rich off this, but neither fast, nor guaranteed, nor easy. Slow and steady wins the race, so get a job to figure out your finances, and only gamble here with what you can afford to lose (duh!)."

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On March 23 the price of **SPY 6/18/21 $320** strike leap calls was **2.50**. Lets say we used $25k to buy 100 contracts and hold until expiration.

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the ask price of **87.40** which gives us a total value of:

#$874,000

No TA and no DD needed. Invest in a boring index **on a dip** and you can secure your retirement.

2021-04-07 06:54:09,wallstreetbets,"Futures are flat as of 0620. Nothing really doing in any major index. Europe and Asia not seeing much action either. This follows a day of small losses for stocks. Bonds are seeing some buying, with the 10-year yield down to 1.65%.

It‚Äôs a quiet period on Wall Street that will probably not change until earnings season kicks off for real next week. In the meantime there is ample time for pontification.

Fed meeting minutes will be released at 1400. That‚Äôs the major data release for today. There is the potential that something could be unearthed here that will spook markets, especially if it‚Äôs a debate about inflation. Probably none of that will matter in the long term. The Fed will raise rates when it is compelled to do so. Regardless of what is said, that decision will likely be a reaction to market activity rather than a shift in the dot plot.

We are supposed to get first quarter earnings from Carnival (NYSE:CCL), the cruise line operator. ‚ÄúSupposed to‚Äù because there is some conflicting information on when this company reports. Kind of hard to figure out. But when we do get it, the numbers should shed light on how leisure travel is shaping up. 

Just got a pretty enthusiastic economic call from Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Dimon has been right about these things before. He‚Äôs not a prognosticator by trade, which is one reason I tend to trust his forecasts more than most.

All else being equal there are reasons to believe the excess liquidity sloshing around the system will find its way to risk assets, specifically stocks, before too long. First quarter earnings could change that, but that will be the story for next week."

2021-04-07 07:08:03,wallstreetbets,"Quick Rant: 

Trading FX and commodities can be more profitable than options. (I trade options too). 

Reason: Cross correlations and Commodity currencies. 

Cross currency correlation:  If you know that GBP/USD is going up you can open long positions in GBP/CAD and GBP/JPY tripling your profits simultaneously. 

Commodity Currencies: If commodities like gold in Australia are going up, you can simultaneously hold long positions on Gold as well as AUS/USD since countries who‚Äôs currencies are connected to strong commodities have a positive correlation. 

It‚Äôs like killing 5 birds with one stone. Multiple profits with one play. (if you do it right)

It‚Äôs also the only market that‚Äôs open 24hrs a day, 5 days a week (asides from weekends) so you can trade pretty much anytime you want. 

Then you can re-invest most of your gains from trading currencies and commodities back into trading options or long term equity plays.

This is the way.

Sry just a rant, been a member before GME and bandwagon fans, and I also like trading options but it‚Äôd be nice to see FX and commodities trading get some more love on here too. :) 

Also, for BB shares, EoY target price $40 and $150+ in 3-5 years. good long term value investment with QNX + IVY + rise of EV market."

I am looking to make a big bet on LAD.  I believe they are going to blow out earnings beyond what Wall Street is estimating and they are a reopening play that is part of the current rotation.

The all time high is 417 and it is currently trading at 387 (up 4).  They release earnings on April 28.

Here is where I need help. 

Which options would you recommend for May that would yield the max profit assuming the stock goes to 420. I want to make to an outsized bet knowing the stock could blow past the all time highs and keep going.

My thinking is to  buy May 390 or 400.

Say you found out (hypothetically of course) that a massive financial company had a flaw in its software that could expose them to billions of dollars of risk. You found this out naturally as an end user using its software. You intend to make this knowledge public on WSB, as well as on other mediums.

Key points:
1. You discovered this flaw as an end user of their software (they have millions of end users)
2. It is not public knowledge yet
3. You are not employed by the company nor do you have friends/family at the company

The question: is it illegal to load up on puts prior to revealing the information? My thought is it is NOT illegal since that‚Äôs kinda what short research firms do with impunity."

To get a full assessment of your risk profile you need to see a doctor for a review of your medical history, physical examination, and when indicated, additional testing that may include urinalysis, semen analysis, etc.

I strongly believe the price is being pushed down on purpose so institutions can load up on the cheap and by Friday will have covered most of their positions!

I don‚Äôt know about $40 this year or $150 in 3 years, but I like your optimism. I feel it will easily reach 10 times it current valuation of $8.99 per share in 3 years. Once the EV market settles in the sky is the limit for this stock! Also, BB has a patent sale in the works to unload patents they don‚Äôt require for their new fundamentals and that will be huge money. I think a lot of people will miss out if they aren‚Äôt buying this $8.99 sale, but that‚Äôs just my opinion. I see people losing out here everyday on stocks worth way more than $8.99 per share."

2021-04-07 09:30:13,wallstreetbets,"Assume you live for 40 years after retiring. You'd need about $2M to make it through. Now assume you have a job that allows you to save 20K a year. You'd need an annual rate of return of around 21%, and that's before taxes. Include cap gains and you're probably looking at 24-25% that you'd need. That's a very difficult proposition."

Phone sales in China were up >200% y/y for the month of Feb, iPhone shipments in the gulf countries were up >50% for the quarter, [Samsung last night said their Q1 profit likely up 44% and in line with estimates](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-results/samsung-electronics-says-q1-profit-likely-rose-44-matching-expectations-idUSKBN2BT33B) but the nugget in there is that they talk about phone sales.  AAPL is poised to destroy analyst estimates for revenue on the hardware side of things.  First 5G phone they've offered on top of wild demand for phones in general?

edit: [link to the China phone sales thing in this old comment, also noting massive massive open interest on June calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ma4qs1/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_march_22_2021/grrg3vx/), it was probably being shorted by some institution at 120 to get those calls filled cheap"

2021-04-07 16:35:41,wallstreetbets,"Ok so I trade spy like a hawk.
I can write w/o to many words and numbers:
we were last flat (volatile af flat at that) finishing our quad witching and end of month and end of q1 among a lot of other factors (political mostly).

So... once the 31st came, we shot up consistent. no volatility from last point of the 30th of march 396ish to 401 basically to end on the month. then april came and we reached 1.6% high to close under of course BUT. That is the point in which we closed today. at mondays high.

Stan Dev, and a bunch of other nonsensical math i do, among other setniment factors... show me that there is a high prob that we will get a bump ...becase
1) we are flat since mon
2) we actually went mostly up
3) volume has held
4)MM have stated we are going...but siad tech is staying down
5) and lastly we are tight with FTSE and HS is also at ATH.

no way are the other markets averages no leveling up with SPY.

Europe had its holidays for and missed 4 trading days and it has shot back up to catch up.

This is a hot potatoe thesis. no on wants to hold the bag so they keep rasing it. I believe we are going to be voliatile but must go higher. like the markets wants to go up....
Heres the fun part... If MM moving tech starts to finally grow some balls and push it (they have been dragging their feet).. then we are going this month I see some really high stuff in the coming days weeks."

Basic jist because I'm starting to forget is just about all the mods, past and future, are u/zjz, but he died in 2013 during a home invasion by Russian gangsters and exists solely as an AI. The mods aren't a single collection either, but splinters of the core zjz... There is ""the board"" who exists to counter balance zjz, but they're pretty sketchy too and sometimes get infiltrated by zjz.  Most of the dream centered around dealing with their conflicts.  Turns out the entire board is also zjz....  The board also has a board that's comprised entirely of famous black actors.  This was the flaw in the AI.  He couldn't figure this out."

Maybe less of one than might be otherwise apparent thanks to the shift towards work-from-home, but some of those buyers are going to get called back to the office and have to move again and some will realize they don't *want* to be where they bought. So you'll wind up with a glut of homes bringing down the market while a lot of mortgages still have very little equity. Won't get 2008 ugly, but it could still be quite the shock to the system."

2021-04-07 08:51:55,wallstreetbets,"sorta.  one thing on my mind is the analysts didn't put out updated price targets aside from UBS.  Every analyst has it rated as a Buy with price targets reflecting the october price of $12 (targeting growth to 24-30).  Now with full year FY21 and guidance for FY22 which hadn't been issued previously, they need to update their targets.

There are reasons to feel like it wont go to 60.  It has debt.  It probably wont sell gym equipment this way ever again.  But they have to catch up to DKS, which keeps going up and is not all the dissimilar from a financial perspective, albeit a better leverage ratio.

if all it does it catch up to the average pricing of the other sporting goods stores, it should get to 40.

and then the issue of the short interest, which it really shouldn't have."
2021-04-07 07:30:16,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah totally agree. I wouldn‚Äôt be buying in now after that run up.

My point was it‚Äôs actually valued fairly by r/investing metrics which is the complete opposite to AMC and GME which has a bat shit crazy valuation and them some."

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Interesting, and amusing news about NIO Hey again everyone, 

So there's been some interesting news surrounding NIO again; and NIOgang, while we're busy in our day to day lives and jobs, we've always got our finger on the pulse for NIO; or at least trying to, haha.

So we know that NIO's sales in Q1 were very impressive--hitting 20,060--[link](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-provides-march-and-first-quarter-2021); increasing 423% year-on-year. At the time this information was released, which was the 1st of April 2020, NIO's cumulative deliveries were 95,701--we've subsequently just learned, as of now, that NIO's 100,000th EV has come off the production line; here a [link](https://twitter.com/42how_/status/1379634663652663299) to see.

I recently learned that NIO is comparing in China very well against the European premium brands Audi, BMW, and Mercedes; here's a [link](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377567655813644290/photo/1). As you can see, NIO is doing **considerably better**; this comes courtesy of Marcel M√ºnch--an analyst I sometimes listen to on youtube on my break. Additionally, NIO is even doing considerably better than VW in China--[link](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377634756490366984) to see that too.

So demand is getting stronger for NIO; and as we know from the last earnings call from the Q4 and full year financials, NIO will be increasing production to around 300-600k in early 2022.

Sales are increasing; revenue is increasing. Oh, also, another thing is that NIO signed a deal with the German retail giant Metro AG; here a [link](https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/29/nio-signs-deal-with-german-retail-giant-on-charging-infrastructure-partnership/). Why this is exciting is because we know NIO is planning on European expansion soon, and an infrastructure agreement with one Germany's biggest retailers with over 600 stores, seems like another big hint what's coming for NIO.

Where does amusement come in? That's right, you guessed it: Jim Cramer.

Jim in on twitter claiming that the current chart shows NIO may go down; here's [link](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1379576154810691593). And the price you wonder it supposedly will go? That's right, Citrons price target. Of course, what's interesting here is when we look at the comment section of Cramer's post; some of my favorites are [1](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379590047503065088), [2](https://twitter.com/ajosephb/status/1379627925868212224), [3](https://twitter.com/Dave15161498/status/1379579270465486853), and [4](https://twitter.com/j04776684/status/1379579589568180226), it seems like the tactic used isn't working. In fact I think it's pretty clear that the suits are trying to manipulate NIO's price by trying to effect sentiment--similar to the same tactics used against GME; and from the comments I linked you all to, I don't think it's going to work. What's also funny, is that Cramer was saying months ago how we was wrong about NIO; his flip-flopping is suspicious, at least to me.

Oh also, I just saw this a minute ago, that William Li Bin, CEO of NIO, has said in a recent interview commemorating the 100,000th EV produced, that he is confident that NIO will exceed 1,000,000 EV saes in China; here the [link](https://twitter.com/Klp168/status/1379667417928933376).

Personally I think we'll see NIO go much higher in the future; we know that institutions are [buying](https://twitter.com/NinjaSwinga/status/1379586316795543553) NIO, and I remain very bullish for them. They've really come a long way since I first was interested in them almost 2 years ago now; I work in the health care industry, and I'm confident that NIO will free me, eventually--my hands are made of diamond too!

I just spend my break writing this, so hopefully it helps some of you remain strong.

NIO all the way.

And I can like this stock, and hate their government, in the exact same way I like Tesla, and hate my government!

Thanks everyone.

Edit\* I put 427% rather than the correct number 423%

Edit 2\* HAHA I just looked found out that Jim Cramer deleted his bearish tweet about NIO; here's a few links for proof [1](https://stocktwits.com/liudasbar/message/312761193), [2](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379776807520542721)"

The main drawback of EV‚Äôs is the their range and charge time, nio has greater range and solves the charge time with its battery replacement service which is faster than refuelling gas cars. In China people don‚Äôt have space to install their own charging plugs at home hence why the swapping is a necessity. Nio will never be as big as Tesla but it has a much higher chance of its stock price going 10x than Tesla‚Äôs... ü§´"

The fact of the Chinese people not having a good possibility of ‚Äúhome-charging‚Äù is a VERY GOOD POINT!!! THX, I will keep that in mind !!!

I‚Äôll keep it short and sweet. Paysafe just went public through a reverse merger SPAC, and has been trading on the NYSE for less than a week. This is like getting in bed with Square at $15/share.

Here are 8 reasons to believeüôå:

1. Bill Foley is behind the merger. The man is a legend in Financial Services and has a strong history of value creation, having led five separate multibillion-dollar public market platforms that completed over 100 acquisitions. Think Fidelity National Financial, Fidelity Information Services, Black Knight Financial, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Ceridian. You know, small companies. ü§™üìàüí∞

2. Founded in 1996, Paysafe is a leading global payments provider focused on digital commerce and iGaming transactions. The global online gambling market size was valued at USD 53.7 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5% from 2020 to 2027. üìà

3. Paysafe holds the No. 2 market share position in the global digital wallet market. The company‚Äôs digital wallet is in over 120 markets and has customers like DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ: DKNG) and William Hill. The company has 3.8 million active users for its digital wallet segment.

4. Paysafe is No. 1 in the iGaming eCash network segment. Customers for this segment include Fortnite, Twitch and Spotify Technologies (NYSE: SPOT).

5. The company estimates that its 2021 payment volume will hit $103 billion. üí∞üí∞üí∞Billion with a B! Revenue of $1.5 billion is estimated for fiscal 2021. Paysafe said revenue will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 11% from 2020 to 2023.

6. The digital wallet segment is expected to have $441 million in revenue for 2021 with a 1.9% take on transactions. This represents 29% of the company‚Äôs 2021 revenue.

7. The eCash segment has 12 million active users and $5 billion in payment volume. This segment has a take of 6.8% and is expected to have 2021 revenue of $318 million.

8. The integrated processing segment has over $75 billion in payment volume and a 1% take. This segment is expected to have revenue of $764 million in fiscal 2021, representing 50% of the company‚Äôs total.

Mind you THIS IS NOT A STARTUP! It‚Äôs a profitable company with a proven track record, robust sales and a lucrative Total Addressable Market within reach. It‚Äôs a long term hold for sure, but with the core drivers outlined above I‚Äôm confident we‚Äôll see this as a 10x bagger in less than 5 years. üíéüöÄüí∞üôåüìà

EDIT 1: Appreciate all the constructive commentary. I'm not perfect and this is my opinion so I welcome other's thoughts! This is what WSB is all about!"
2021-04-07 00:29:17,wallstreetbets,"Checking in with 500 at 14.50. If it goes down, I buy more. If it goes down, again, I buy more again. If it goes down again, I start examining my life choices and looking forlornly at my PLTR bags."
2021-04-07 01:38:16,wallstreetbets,"Question:  If this is a mature and profitable company, why have they been losing money for the past 2 quarters?  Most recent quarter the EPS was negative (loss) of 4 cents per share according to the financials on Yahoo Finance."
2021-04-07 03:56:59,wallstreetbets,"Lol. Paysafe is niche, small fry in his market segment. There is a value there but dethrone SQ and PYPL? What the fuck are you smoking? Paysafe is not Stripe.

Your bags must be heavy."
2021-04-07 08:35:29,wallstreetbets,"Nice to see this one on wsb. They are way undervalued atm, and April will see the new PTs come in for it. They are well positioned in big growth sectors and have a great management team. 

They have a helluva long way to get anywhere near paypal and Square, but for what they are now and what they'll grow into, its dirt cheap."
2021-04-07 07:12:09,wallstreetbets,Paysafe is huge and insanely popular in EU. They also own Skrill and more. Paysafe needs some more traction in the US but i firmy believe it's heavily undervalued. Am holding a mere 50 shares since I'm not a rich retard
2021-04-07 01:00:41,wallstreetbets,"The only second SPAC aside from BFLY I felt were warranted (yes, that is meant as a bad joke). 2k shares"

2021-04-07 05:51:41,wallstreetbets,Hi mate. I‚Äôm from the UK. I honestly don‚Äôt think you guys realise how big sports betting is going to be in the US. Buy and forget about this one fo sho.
2021-04-07 08:42:13,wallstreetbets,"I agree with others that Paysafe is not going to dethrone anyone however they are niche in that they process payments for gambling and that is getting bigger every day in USA. I used Skrill in the UK and it was pretty easy, that is why i'm invested."
2021-04-07 00:29:42,wallstreetbets,What is paysafes price target say in June/July?

2021-04-07 04:41:15,wallstreetbets,10% CAGR is trash for fintech. Can't beat SQ with that.
2021-04-07 10:32:46,wallstreetbets,Way worse bets out there than riding with Papa Foley. Warrants seem like a play here
2021-04-06 23:52:24,wallstreetbets,July *22.5C all day
2021-04-07 00:43:34,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve started accumulating a small position but my understanding is CVC and Blackrock are likely to monetize most/ all of their gains when their lockup‚Äôs expire which I think is 80 days from Mar 29th.

Edit: For people that don‚Äôt know that much about PE: PE investors value ‚ÄúIRR‚Äù (internal rate of return) more than ‚ÄúMOIC‚Äù (multiple on invested capital). They also value getting money back. Blackstone will sell a portion of their stake this year. For sure. Maybe not ‚Äúall‚Äù of their gains. 
Also for the stock‚Äôs long term prospects Blackstone and CVC need to sell some of their stakes. Institutional investors don‚Äôt like it when there‚Äôs a big overhang from PE."
2021-04-07 00:54:50,wallstreetbets,"pretty good stuff, I'm sure it will go up considerably in the next few weeks & months. good find."

2021-04-07 05:34:03,wallstreetbets,"If this is an established company then why a spac instead of an ipo?

2021-04-07 01:21:26,wallstreetbets,How much exposure does this stock have to the company?

2021-04-07 01:13:21,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs the float
2021-04-07 05:29:20,wallstreetbets,I used to use paysafe a lot for ingame purchases before paypal took over. Could they become a serious competitor again? I did like their service better than paypal.
2021-04-07 03:54:33,wallstreetbets,"Eurgh, cant even find this stock on revolut"
2021-04-07 12:44:10,wallstreetbets,"So if your claim is they stand to over take square. What competition do they have for cash app.

Cash app makes square people's smart phone their wallet. 

And also functions as their checking, and brokerage accounts with their stock purchasing and paycheck direct deposit options respectively.

In short, cash app already has its broader audience, and is in their pockets. What barrier to entry is there for Square if they decide to try their hand in the revenue sources you outlined? 

If people could link their draft kings account to their cash app i dont see anything stopping people from doing that"
2021-04-07 13:36:46,wallstreetbets,I think warrants is the play here for PSFE. What's the ticker? I thought it was [PSFE.WS](https://PSFE.WS) but can only find [BTF.WS](https://BTF.WS)..?
2021-04-07 13:48:12,wallstreetbets,I lost 100k on paysafe. I hope they fuck off.

2021-04-07 08:12:31,wallstreetbets,Their website is confusing and lackluster. It's a no from me dawg
2021-04-07 15:27:48,wallstreetbets,This English company is ... tanking!
2021-04-07 05:14:14,wallstreetbets,The only reason why I ever heard of Paysafe was for anonymous payments to shady websites...
2021-04-07 09:57:26,wallstreetbets,Paysafe was not purchased by global payment?
2021-04-07 00:39:07,wallstreetbets,We all got a DEAL on this because there wasn‚Äôt IPO hype. Would‚Äôve been $40/share if they went traditional route to market
2021-04-07 03:16:44,wallstreetbets,"Let my start at the beginning, when i was a young boy from Bulgaria."
2021-04-07 04:43:15,wallstreetbets,"The merger wasn‚Äôt just to go to the stock exchange. They needed Foley and his expertise, and this guy is a maniac. Just look at Fidelity. If you don‚Äôt like it as of now my opinion is to keep an eye on their developments in the near future."
2021-04-07 12:37:53,wallstreetbets,"The company has healthy EBITDA, but bottom line earnings are acutely suffering from interest/dep/amortization expenses associated with the acquisition of iPayment in 2018."
2021-04-07 03:15:41,wallstreetbets,"Mature yes profitable no, i think Psfe have a lot of debt and part of the spac money is going to pay that down"
2021-04-07 04:00:39,wallstreetbets,PaySafe has higher profit margins than PayPal and generates over $300 million in free cash flow which is more than most fintechs can say even though they trade at much higher multiples. PaySafe is undervalued relative to sector peers.
2021-04-07 02:27:06,wallstreetbets,Inappropriate question
2021-04-07 07:58:39,wallstreetbets,Thanks for mentioning Stripe. I almost forgot about them.
2021-04-07 05:29:07,wallstreetbets,Go on...
2021-04-07 12:13:12,wallstreetbets,Bags are on display for all to see. And a SQ shareholder as well. PSFE is positioned to leverage multiple high growth verticals that SQ has yet to touch....iGaming/Video Gaming/Sports Betting being the key competitive driver for them. $3.4B TAM in 2019 --> $47B in 2025?  And they're already No. 1 in the iGaming eCash network segment? Yes please.
2021-04-07 14:23:15,wallstreetbets,"Yes not Stripe but interesting comparison. Through funding rounds, Stripe was recently valued at 52.8X EV/Rev.  If you applied that multiple to Paysafe, it would be worth $110.  That's nearly 8x profit from here."
2021-04-07 08:49:28,wallstreetbets,"exactly. aside from laudering money, cashing out on scams, and stealing mom's credit card for skin, paysafe isn't that useful"
2021-04-07 17:00:13,wallstreetbets,"Tend to agree, it's not even a fair fight. PayPal and Square are just too big"
2021-04-07 12:04:33,wallstreetbets,Already has two PTs so far and both are buy ratings with a $19 target
2021-04-07 12:51:18,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Wait until their 1st quarterly. We'll have analysts initiating coverage out the whazooo.
2021-04-07 06:44:36,wallstreetbets,IF the pandemic is over soon.
2021-04-07 08:40:10,wallstreetbets,The US sports consumer is different from the UK sports consumer. I don't think sports betting will have as much influence over there tbh
2021-04-07 09:39:33,wallstreetbets,"They're niche but fuck, what a niche! Gambling and video games. ..."
2021-04-07 00:37:24,wallstreetbets,With more nonstop aggressive shorting and price manipulation? $14. Without all that bullshit? $40+
2021-04-07 13:22:57,wallstreetbets,Do you plan on converting them to shares at some time? If so what is your broker's fee for conversion?
2021-04-07 01:49:43,wallstreetbets,Looks like a recipe for a tenbagger
2021-04-07 15:07:58,wallstreetbets,That's all the DD I need!
2021-04-07 14:29:16,wallstreetbets,That's actually average for the sector. Shift4 reported only 4% y-o-y growth. Fisv projects 5%. The real growth with be inorganic through M&A and organic through expansion of US iGaming.  They've deliberately left that out of their projections to be conservative. Foley is known for underpromising and overperforming.
2021-04-07 12:50:06,wallstreetbets,Indeed!
2021-04-07 00:48:26,wallstreetbets,I wouldn‚Äôt be so sure. Here‚Äôs a good DD. They get the long term value. https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/mkctco/paysafe_lockup_periods_and_times_of_expiration/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
2021-04-07 03:43:05,wallstreetbets,"They‚Äôve signaled that they‚Äôre staying on:
Eli Nagler, a Senior Managing Director at Blackstone, just said: ‚ÄúWe believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.‚Äù  
 
Regarding Blackstone and CVC, who now have four senior managing directors on Paysafe‚Äôs Board, Foley said, ‚ÄúThey rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn‚Äôt take all their money off the table‚Ä¶ All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.‚Äù"
2021-04-07 03:17:37,wallstreetbets,I hope they don‚Äôt dump it into the market.

2021-04-07 12:49:41,wallstreetbets,My pleasure. I wish I had gotten in with SQ at the ground floor and kick myself in the pants everyday for not doing so. I see PSFE as being severely undervalued for what the future holds.
2021-04-07 01:06:39,wallstreetbets,6 month lock up for PIPE and 3 months for private equity.
2021-04-07 00:45:21,wallstreetbets,Great DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/mkctco/paysafe_lockup_periods_and_times_of_expiration/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
2021-04-07 15:09:16,wallstreetbets,"I'm new to investing, can anyone explain what this means?"
2021-04-07 13:49:23,wallstreetbets,"PSFE has marginally higher debt-to-asset ratio than SQ. This is primarily a result of Pi UK Bidco Limited and iPayment Holdings acquisitions in 2017/2018 respectively. 

SQ - $3.4B debt to $9.8B assets = 35% Degree of Leverage  
PSFE - $3.2B debt to $7.4B assets = 43% DoL

Not too worried about it now that they're public again with a massive injection of capital."
2021-04-07 00:10:32,wallstreetbets,WSB
2021-04-07 03:54:58,wallstreetbets,The fact that all fintech competitors trade at much higher multiples. This is undervalued.

2021-04-07 12:48:52,wallstreetbets,"Honestly they will co-exist with SQ. I hold SQ as well for that very reason. But SQ only operates in United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, United Kingdom at the present. PSFE is global in 120+ markets.  And they already have a network of digital wallet solutions that enable users to upload, store, withdraw & pay funds from a virtual account."
2021-04-07 14:38:06,wallstreetbets,Depends on the brokerage. I'm using PSFE/WS. Could be PSFE+ or PSFE.WT or some other variation.

2021-04-07 16:16:23,wallstreetbets,"Thank you.  I was digging through all the news sources I could find on $PSFE to see why they had a negative EPS and couldn't find anything definitive, even looked at their 20-F filing and saw only vague mentions of unspecified expenses.  Will look and see what's out there in regard to the iPayment acquisition and why it's dragging them down."
2021-04-07 04:05:21,wallstreetbets,Actually very low debt to equity ratio.
2021-04-07 07:55:16,wallstreetbets,"I mean they actually don‚Äôt, since PayPal actually makes money. More profitable at Gross Margin level but their adjusted EBITDA is non GAAP so you gotta make the same adjustments if you wanna compare apples to apples. 

PayPal is also growing faster lmao, as a 21bn revenue company"
2021-04-07 03:07:50,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the question
2021-04-07 06:20:14,wallstreetbets,Very appropriate question.
2021-04-07 12:59:52,wallstreetbets,"Stripe sucks, it only gained popularity being the only free option for websites to use seamless checkout. Everything else paypal, square etc you have to pay to have a seamless option or customer is redirected."
2021-04-07 05:41:57,wallstreetbets,"There is plenty of old (2020) DD on BFT/Paysafe available on WSB. Have a look. I did initial research and did not find it compelling back then. Do your own DD and decide for yourself.

Don't listen to this bagholder though. Too much delusion."

2021-04-07 11:24:55,wallstreetbets,"Not sure why you‚Äôre being downvoted for an honest opinion. This is reddit I suppose. I‚Äôve been involved in the industry and have seen plenty of data. The stats show that ‚Äòmuricans are more likely to bet on sport than Brits. They also bet much larger amounts. Since gambling was liberalised here, several companies have grown into absolute titans. See bet365 and flutter (Betfair/paddy power), who must be US acquisition targets. Look at how popular your fantasy sports are! I don‚Äôt know if this company will do well, but sports betting in the US will be gigantic"
2021-04-07 09:06:43,wallstreetbets,"did you see how much money was spent this year on betting for march madness and the super bowl? i dont think you realize there is a lot of interest and with more states easing restrictions, it will only get bigger"

2021-04-07 14:13:33,wallstreetbets,"I think I'm unlikely to convert them, at least in full as I won't have the liquidity. I'm also not going to sell for a long while most likely. 

 It's a single fee for the transaction with vanguard (I'm #old) no additional fee for it being a conversion."
2021-04-07 03:52:04,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt think they will. In ‚ÄúFTAC‚Äôs Board of Directors‚Äô Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination‚Äù, they state: ‚ÄúCommitment of Paysafe‚Äôs Owners.

2021-04-07 09:08:12,wallstreetbets,"Not really. People gamble on sports regardless of wether they are attending the event. In the uk, you can bet on any sport, anytime, on your phone. The US will go that way, there is so much money and tax to be made."

2021-04-07 18:02:03,wallstreetbets,Selling $15 puts at different maturities on this one has been very profitable so far. Intraday volatility is so high that is relatively easy to sell when the price is in the 13-13.5 range and closing when is in the 14-14.5 range. You benefit from delta and theta.
2021-04-07 07:59:41,wallstreetbets,Yup. Increasing EBITDA margins going forward

2021-04-07 13:36:40,wallstreetbets,"Laws are strange when it comes to gambling in the US, and it's been years since I looked it up, but for a long time there was a federal law prohibiting gambling over the phone, i.e. call your bookie to place a bet, which was later used to restrict gambling over the internet, look at what happened with online poker in the US between like 2005-10, so much madness and inconsistencies in applying the laws.

2021-04-07 08:19:43,wallstreetbets,No they are not. That‚Äôs true. Sector peer valuations matter nonetheless. EV/EBITDA and EV/rev comps across 10 top fintechs puts Paysafe comfortably in the $40‚Äôs but first it‚Äôll go to mid $20‚Äôs with audited numbers. Announcements of M&A plans will take it higher from there. Foley has grown five companies 5x to 14x through successful M&A execution and he‚Äôs said that‚Äôs his plan with PaySafe. He actually said it is more in line with FIS which he grew 91x. His track record is proven.
2021-04-07 09:10:35,wallstreetbets,"I know its picking back up, but who knows what will happen this year"
2021-04-07 15:00:40,wallstreetbets,Supreme court overturned federal ban a couple years ago and NY legalized gambling a couple days ago. It's happening.
2021-04-07 08:59:35,wallstreetbets,"Yes!  I miss the good old days when the sub was 700k.  Can you believe we have 9.7M degenerates?  With that said, it is kind of fun when folks take my sarcasm as an endorsement."

What do you think they will acquire to offset their slower organic growth? Have they mentioned any targets?"
2021-04-07 09:31:06,wallstreetbets,What do you mean? Are sports going to stop because the pandemic is over?
2021-04-07 15:06:44,wallstreetbets,"Took long enough. Thanks for the info, I'll probably look into it again."
2021-04-07 10:43:45,wallstreetbets,Too early to say. A few days ago they said M&A plans were already in the works but they didn‚Äôt offer specifics.
2021-04-07 09:31:48,wallstreetbets,Thinking the pandemic is over is a risky way of thinking
2021-04-07 10:01:38,wallstreetbets,"it‚Äôs far from *over*, but I think we‚Äôve reached a point where sports taking place without crowds is viewed as a relatively innocent event, even back at the peak of COVID. people continue to gamble at a high rate even if they can‚Äôt attend the event in person, in my experience. most of the gamblers I know usually *don‚Äôt* attend the event live, as the gambling itself is often a way to make a rather boring night spent on your couch watching the game on TV much more interesting."
2021-04-07 11:02:34,wallstreetbets,"My original comment was in reference to the statement of ""what does the pandemic have to do with sports?"". While it does look like the pandemic is winding down, there are still a lot of unknowns about it. Just because some vaccines are out doesn't mean we are out of the woods.

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Guggenheim‚Äôs Minerd Sees Another Archegos-Style Blowup as ‚ÄòHighly Likely‚Äô 
2021-04-07 00:08:51,wallstreetbets,"*spits out gas station grade coffee* whoa whoa whoa, you mean to tell me that there are other firms overextending themselves with basically free money?"
2021-04-07 00:05:06,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúI just see us as being very, very vulnerable to something coming out of the blue that nobody is really anticipating,‚Äù Minerd said.

Huh. Their abbreviation is SI."
2021-04-07 08:04:38,wallstreetbets,"Alan Schwartz is a current executive chairman at Guggenheim partners. Alan Schwartz was also the CEO of Bear Stearns during the 2008 crash. How the fuck is this possible.

These cunts just moved to different firms, no penalties....it was the opposite, they got fucking payouts and continue fucking people over to this day."
2021-04-07 02:39:19,wallstreetbets,">Guggenheim Investments Chairman Scott Minerd said it‚Äôs only a matter of time before another firm implodes in a manner similar to Bill Hwang‚Äôs Archegos Capital Management.


>‚ÄúIt is highly likely that we are going to have another situation like that,‚Äù Minerd said Monday in a Bloomberg Television interview. Major losses, such as those incurred by Archegos, ‚Äútend to continue to cascade until the market corrects and flushes the risk out of the system,‚Äù he said.


>Archegos, Hwang‚Äôs family office, sent tremors through financial markets in recent weeks as banks liquidated $20 billion of positions linked to the firm. The forced sales -- marking one of the biggest margin calls ever -- included shares of ViacomCBS Inc., GSX Techedu Inc. and Discovery Inc. Lenders including Nomura Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG said they may face significant losses as a result.


>The episode underscores the impact one obscure firm can have on the rest of Wall Street. It has also spurred a reckoning over how Archegos, as a private entity, was able to place outsize wagers using derivatives while remaining shielded from the disclosures required of most investors. The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened a preliminary investigation into Hwang‚Äôs leveraged trades.


>‚ÄúI just see us as being very, very vulnerable to something coming out of the blue that nobody is really anticipating,‚Äù Minerd said.
More oversight may be coming for family offices, he said. The market for special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, could also become an area of inquiry for regulators in cases where earnings projections don‚Äôt measure up to results, Minerd said."

*puts on tinfoil pirate hat*

They only put this out into the ether if they want retail spooked, especially now as retail has a bunch of money in the market and swings it around like a toddler, so that they can scoop up shares and go long on positions that retail has dumped. That way they can drive it up by saying that risk mitigation has been put into place, so they can dump these shares back onto retail, and then maybe have a crash."

2021-04-07 15:42:32,wallstreetbets,"> Can you get margin called on long positions?

Yes, if it is in a margin account. These companies just use a high leverage on trades that ""can't go wrong"", until they do. 

For example, the hedge fund might bet that no stock goes down more than 9 days in a row with an extremely high leverage and quite possibly no stock has gone down more than 9 days in a row. Then it happens, and their whole portfolio is wiped out. Ultimately, the hedge fund might have a complex structure, quite possibly designed with insider's knowledge how to make it impossible to quantify the risk, and at the end of the day it just comes down to having found one of those infinite leverage bugs like in Robinhood, but then with a bank like Credit Suisse. Same shit, slightly better suits. 

For banks there is no real reason to support such stupid ideas, but for the sales divisions at banks there is, because they typically get bonuses for exposing the bank to risk (crazy, I know)."

2021-04-07 17:50:24,wallstreetbets,"Essentially, Morgan scammed a few hedge funds.
The bank called them offering to sell Viacom stock af a discount. What the bank didn‚Äôt disclose was that it was planning to sell a lot more of the same stock on the market right after, which would cause its price to tank.

In other words, a typical scenario where the bank, to protect itself, tries to sell to its clients the crap it owns and knows it‚Äôs about to implode. It‚Äôs not uncommon.

Archegos didn‚Äôt own the stock directly, to begin with. Archegos bought exposition to the stock thru legeraged derivative contracts. The banks which sold those contracts, on the other hand, had to buy lots of the underlining stock to hedge their risk.
So when the contracts were closed because Archegos couldn‚Äôt provide more margin, the banks found themselves owners of a lot of stock they didn‚Äôt need anymore, and didn‚Äôt want. And they looked for a way to dump it."
2021-04-07 13:52:02,wallstreetbets,"Nope. Essentially what this guy did is borrowed money from the banks to buy more stock, without the other banks knowing. When Viacom stock started tanking, the banks thought this guy would still have enough money to pay them back, until they realized that he did this with a ton of banks.

Each bank is allowed to take back the money they lended to the guy whenever they want (or take the stock and immediately sell it off in this case). Now the banks could have said, ""it's in all our best interests to sell off slowly, together"", but if Morgan Stanley thinks, ""no it's not, this is a sinking ship, staying on longer is just gonna cause us more pain"" they are totally within their rights to dump all their stock immediately.

As for who they sold the stocks to, Morgan Stanley doesn't need to tell them everything they know. Knowing that another bank holds the same position as you isn't insider trading.

Yeah, it's a shitty move to do to keep things quiet, but the funds that bought from Morgan Stanley know that when they all of a sudden say, ""you want to buy billions in stock, for 10% off, tonight"" that shit is fucked. It's their job to assess whether the risk is worth it (and a lot of them made money because some stocks didn't drop as much as expected, or at least not immediately)."

2021-04-07 18:30:11,wallstreetbets,"This isn‚Äôt about the stock offering.

The bank owned Viacom and other stocks as a hedge for the contracts it had with Archegos. Once those contracts were abruptly called off, that ‚Äúhedge‚Äù became a huge long position.
They didn‚Äôt want it, they knew it was going to collapse in price (because they didn‚Äôt want it and they were going to dump it), and they looked for suckers who would buy some of it off them before dumping the rest.
Some hedge funds took the bait.

‚ÄúHello, would you like to buy some Viacom stock at a discount? We happen to have some from a client‚Äù.
What the bank didn‚Äôt mention to the prospective buyers was that it had a lot more Viacom in stock than it was selling to them. And it didn‚Äôt mention that it was planning to dump it, either. Because, you know, if their clients knew the whole story they wouldn‚Äôt have bought it. And then it could have turned into a loss for the bank.

Moral of the story: if you are a big bank and own some security you know it‚Äôs about to implode, you call some clients and try to sell it to them. After all, a bank‚Äôs priority is to make money for itself, not for its clients."

But here, the bank itself is the one doing the selling. It was handed a pile of assets that it needed to liquidate, along with a bunch of other banks. There's no obligation to the other banks to not start selling before the others do.

 And the bank doesn't have to announce it's own sell off/how big it is before it starts obviously, that would be an absurd requirement.

I just don't see where you're coming from. It seems to me like you're saying that it's insider trading because the bank knew about its own sell off before it happened, but I'm pretty sure that's *not* what you're trying to say because that would be absurd."

I think your opinion is entirely lacking in nuance.   It is somewhat the bank's fault if they make a risky loan. It is somewhat the borrower's fault if they sign an ARM that will force a foreclosure.  But banks got off of being responsible in 2008, even getting bailed out, while normal people lost the mortgage, even when they didn't deserve it.  My dad didn't sign an ARM that was a stupid value, he bought a modest house at the wrong time and exhausted his savings over 2 years of unemployment.

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Improving as a trader So what do you guys do to improve your trading game?  I've been using a notebook and keeping track of my trades and writing down what worked and what didn't, as well as coming up with rules to follow to stop myself from repeating mistakes I see more than once.

For example, I've discovered that my biggest weakness is that my prime animal isn't a bear or a bull, it's a pig.  I've missed the direction of a trade exactly three times in the last year, but I've lost money on dozens of trades that I went from green to red on because I refused to accept that the top was in.  This had led to realized losses of over $7k - small potatoes to some of  you, big potatoes to others.  And remember, at one point, I was up on basically every single one of those trades, so the losses counting unrealized and never taken gains are much, much worse.

 I've realized the reason for this is that while the trade is still open, I feel like I'm proving to myself and the world that I'm smart enough to figure out something, and closing the trade by taking profit means I've given up on my idea or admitted it's wrong - nonsensical, I know, but you've got to figure out why you're doing foolish behaviors if you want to stop them.

Since then I've started to set stop sales and it's really helped me to take profits and improve my skills (and portfolio), because once I'm no longer emotionally invested in being ""right"" as I've already taken profit I can much more easily analyze how the equity or trend is doing going forwards, and whether or not it's something I'm happy staying out of or if I want to get back into it at the current price.

My next step is figuring out when to abandon losing positions instead of riding them to zero and starting to make successful hedges on my positions.

How about you?  What are your biggest weaknesses and how are you working to address them and improve?  Share and help the class, we're all trying to make money here, and we're all admitted idiots using fake names, plus it's unlikely your fuckups will be worse than the embarrassing shit I've already posted."

The exact amount and quick. Kept making foolish bets after foolish bet based on the potential of earning, and not actually making rational calculations. Thankfully, I took a break and got perspective. I'm now patient, and I observe the market to see opportunities present themselves and act. Now I'm up 24k.

2021-04-06 23:37:05,wallstreetbets,"Approach trading more systematically. Devalue money. One suggestion I've seen that can help new traders, don't ever put more than 5% of your account's value into a trade. Trading isn't about finding big wins, it's about avoiding big losses while waiting for big wins to show up.

Also, consider not trading. 80% of traders don't beat the market. Buying SPY and holding it for years, as boomer as it sounds, is one of the best ways to make money. Combine that with selling covered calls. Which can both serve as a good exit strategy and decent passive income.

If you buy a company that has good balance sheets and stable income, in the long run, it's a guarantee to work yourself out of a losing position. Something like WFC is never going to be allowed to go bankrupt and has a low stock price. Start by buying 100 shares, and selling weekly or monthly covered calls.

I generally aim if the price drops 10% to 20% as my ""average down"" point. Where I'll buy more to lower my average cost so that my covered calls can still print, but won't be netting me a loss if they get assigned."

But at the very least, they will help me screen out the dog shit and do the most basic DD for me to use as a starting point for idea generation.

But also diversify a bit among sectors...  so I've got some DKNG, NCLH, CCL, DIS

Meme stocks are fine, but buy when cheap as fuck and with calls get them a bit out.  Some shit has stupid premiums.  Don't buy those.

When the market is doing great and everything is on fire, that's not the time to buy.  That's the time to unwind positions and take profits.

When shit sells off, you have you have to have a big pile of cash on hand to buy with.  If all your shit bled down during a sell off you can't buy the bottom.

Made a bunch of money on GME in March.  Then lost 20% of it because I was buying everything high.  Managed to get out as Nasdaq corrected down 10%.  But I had been watching all that shit.

When MU was around 80, LRCX was 550, AMAT 95... I bought a shit ton of calls cheap as fuck.  Same thing with the BB dip and cruise lines.

Then as it went up I started taking profits.

Did I sell AMAT and LRCX too soon.  Fuck yeah.  Did I buy back in.  Fuck no.  I'm not buying shit now.  I'm just taking profits.

When shit tanks back down I will buy calls again.  Am I missing out on shit.  Fuck yeah.  But my portfolio value is growing and I've got a ton of fucking ammo when prices come down.

Also once shit reaches 100%, I always sell half and cover my investment.  Now if it starts to sell off I'm good and can exit and still have gain overall.  I can also have the balls to let it moon because my risk is now zero."

Do not FOMO !  
(It massively diminishes your chances of being able to make a profit on a trade. If you have missed a trade past a good window, let it go and move on to the next thing)

Do not be greedy !

(there is always that thought in the back of your head - it could go a little higher, and a little higher, ‚Ä¶ DON'T ! Just sell when you have a comfortable profit and move on)  


Do not trade with EMOTIONS or SENTIMENT only by numbers!

&#x200B;

Use a good charting solution (I like TradingView premium) and learn it inside out.  
Make extensive use of alarms to be alerted on sudden price movements (TradingView is absolutely fantastic as it has extensive charting tools that let you draw patterns around stock movement and set alarms when the price movement leaves a pattern so you can let certain stocks run on ""auto pilot"" while you work elsewhere).  
Always have a good idea where your portfolio is at and what your positions look like BEFORE trading starts.  
Be prepared BEFORE trading starts.  
Don't believe the media (if there is a #1 takeaway from following recent events on WSB it has proven strongly that the media is full of shit and you absolutely have to make your own DD).  
Always make a plan for the day - which positions you plan to sell, which to load up on, which stocks to look into, ideas for trading games, ...  
Then follow through on your plans.  
Use margin for short term leverage or quick moves before cash clears on accounts but NEVER GET SQUEEZED into the corner of margin call!  
Always have ""play money"" on reserve to make quick day trades or react to an opportunity.  
Do not lock up all funds in ""dead stocks"" that just sit there forever and you hoping for the stock to ""recover""  
Those funds often times are better used, doing day trading for small profits if the profits outplay the loss taken on liquidating a bad position."

Another excellent trait. Even if you're not doing this professionally, the lambo salesman doesn't get paid in ""rightness"". Take your profit.

All in all, I would say you are more than halfway done with your psych-game (and let's face it, you don't need to be a technical or fundamental analysis deity to make money, unless you have targets to keep). What I like, in particular, is that you seem well-aware of things that need improvement and I doubt many people will be able to offer you any useful advice since they can barely advise themselves, from ignoring so many of their own shortcomings (<= *GET IT, AGAIN???*). Perhaps the meager advice I could offer would be something along the line: **Don't be afraid to trust the price patterns you identified on your own. If you managed to identified your own thought patterns, you probably have the analytical mind to identify the market one. And stay humble so that you don't lose that skill to conceit.**

For the record, my biggest mistake is that I never manage to imagine the stock i'm holding will go up another 10-20% for the day/week. *It's already so overpriced....surely people won't be dumb enough to b... And it's gone up another 20%*. The real issue is when you dissuade yourself from holding it in the first place."

Then I've been doing a ton of research and DD to figure out if I'm right or if there is enough loose supply to cover the gap between surging demand and production/distribution lag.  Even with the OPEC+ meeting tossing another 2 million BPD on the market in June, I don't think there's close to enough supply on the market.

It's not a loss until you sell.

What's worked best for me is sticking to things I understood. If I could understand how they make money, and kinda visualize their business plan, I check into them. You do this because you have to understand potential flaws that can fuck things up. Like right now, we have a chip shortage, this hurts many tech companies.

I go by basic fundamentals and check financials, and balance sheet. If the money is whack, stay away. I then check tech specs and try to just find an entry point. For options, I usd IV Rank and IV. For buying stock at a good price, RSI and EMA/SMA, and patience. Watch for a moment, it'll kinda be obvious when you see it if you've been watching it for a little while. Things tend to line up.

Puts>shorts. You can‚Äôt get squeezed by buying puts. Look at any bankrupt company and a lot of them squeeze prior to bankruptcy.     

Are you sure you don‚Äôt want to go long-short within the same industry? The aim of a long-short portfolio isnt to win on the hedge and the long position, but to make either the hedge or the long profitable. You will often see funds and some institutions(citadel) buying puts, then buying calls, and finally driving prices by filling in shares. Trying to find a profitable hedge within the same industry can pay dividends, especially when investing based around events or catalysts."
2021-04-06 23:11:21,wallstreetbets,"Imo, I don‚Äôt think we see oil breaking the $70 mark this year. OPEC+ is still sitting on about 7mbo/day that can enter the market when they want. I think this will keep prices in check as long as the US doesn‚Äôt go bat-shit crazy and bring out another 500 rigs. Which I don‚Äôt think they will as all E&P companies are trying to work off of FCF and production growth is not the main driver for probably the next 18-24 months. 
The industry will continue to consolidate using equity deals as big cash deals are not in favor. 
I agree people want to travel and you will see demand increase from 2020 levels and oil stocks should appreciate. I missed the MTDR run and kick myself daily for not getting in at $2.25...ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Currently not holding oil stocks but recently exited $PE & $FANG and am looking for a new entry point on a couple.

That's almost the highest GME has gotten, at least trading on shares alone. If you bought last year at 5 and sold at 400, I mean. 

My god, man. Definitely picking up XL, as someone seems to be pointing too. Those $9 calls still going quite cheap. Seems like an easy bet.

So at that time 21k would have gotten him around 60 shares. That day was also very volatile though with GME ranging from 250-414 so I can't really tell the exact price at the moment his order filled. Buying 100 shares at that time would have cost between 25k-41k. Not to mention some brokers had a limit on how many shares/contracts you could buy, screenshot looks like he has TD and if I recall some days you could only buy up to 3 shares/contracts so it made more sense to just buy 3 contracts instead of 3 shares to simulate controlling more shares.

Options printing hard is based on the greeks, one of the big ones being delta. When he entered the contract the delta was probably around 78 but now it's dropped to 62."

Newegg is primarily pc components and they fucked up by selling out, which has led to terrible customer service and using a shit delivery service as their primary.

2021-04-07 07:15:55,wallstreetbets,"That ws his specialty in Chewy, plus he's got execs from amazon so definitely will shift to e commerce, maybe getting an online service like steam and getting some exclusives, also turning the stores into  gaming destinations and cool places for gamers to hangout after the pandemic are a few ideas"
2021-04-07 12:50:09,wallstreetbets,"Steam won't be toppled, especially by the likes of gamestop. I think steam will only be budged off the top of PC gaming through some shift in paradigm like the rapid adoption of cloud gaming which people have been waiting around for years for (and Microsoft have been dipping their toe in the water in that regard). I don't know about gaming destinations mainly because that is essentially a cybercafe operation which is a hard market to do well in and doesn't really work in many countries (where most people have their own PCs and good internet). It has almost nothing to with their current business model except both involve games, too, so it's not like it's an obvious pivot.

I just think RC's takeover is less about a gaming revolution where he wants to compete with dominating companies and innovate the industry and more him seeing a niche for Gamestop to be completely online while capitalizing on their goodwill. Again looking at his past this is what he is good at, process and system improvement in competitive industries to turn around underperforming businesses."
2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"MYOV: Deep Value and Possible Buy Out Okay smooth brains, gonna come at you with some DD on a true value play (for those of you that can read). With a great entry as of writing.

The good stuff:

1 great drug, 3 potential use cases.
The basics of any biotech pharma company are the drugs and what they do. Simply put, relugolix (orgovyx) was approved by the FDA in December for the treatment of Prostate Cancer. The drug was so much better than its competition, they were granted priority review by the FDA. How much better were they? Well the competition was a once a month shot that had a high mortality rate due to cardiovascular issues. Since this approval, they have signed a 4.3b deal with pfizer for half the drug, and are now commercializing this together at a rapid pace.

The other use cases are endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Uterine fibroids have a pdufa (fda approval deadline) of June 1st and after meeting and exceeding all 3 phases of clinicals, are highly likely to pass (these are big positive catalysts).

This is also accompanied by 2 additional publications in the New England medical journal. One of the most renowned journals in the world.

Now that we‚Äôve covered the basics in Lehman‚Äôs terms, let‚Äôs move on to the strategic outlay.


In january of 2021, Pfizer and Myovant announced a strategic partnership for men‚Äôs prostate cancer worth up to 4.3b for myovant. It also resulted in heavy upfront cash payments, and royalties in the double digits to myovant moving forward. After this announcement, the stock shot up to $31 a share.

Before this, another pharma giant, sumitomo, decided it was going to expand its pharmaceuticals pipeline. To do so it started an American subsidiary named sumitovant and purchased Roivants share of 5 different companies. To date, 4/5 of the companies are now private with urovant recently getting bought out by sumitovant at 100% premium. 

Myovant is the crown jewel of the vants. If you go to sumitovants website, they claim ownership over myovant already (53.5% makes them a majority holder).

It‚Äôs my theory that myovant is not far behind and will likely be purchased before June 1st PDUFA. At this time, the stock has been seeing a pretty large short interest increase and is trading below the PPS it had in November before approval for relugolix and before the Pfizer deal. 

Without a buyout, this is a steal of a value play.

Myovant has roughly 40% of their market cap in cash. Pfizer valued just the prostate cancer application at 8.4b. Their current market cap is ~1.8b and they are trading at $18.93 a share.

I plan to ride this rocket to Valhalla üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ 

TLDR:
Company has successful drug applications that are new standards of care, a massive deal with Pfizer, wildly undervalued, and a potential buyout candidate. 

üöÄ Positions: ~20k shares, 326 calls dated from 4/16 all the way to 1/22

Quick about me: I‚Äôve been on WSB (mostly lurking) since mid 2020 and trading for years. My past plays include riding Tesla from $100 presplit, sunrun from $6, and of course GME from $10 all the way up to $400. 


None of this is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. I‚Äôm just a retard yolo‚Äôing half a million dollars."
2021-04-07 02:06:44,wallstreetbets,"God I hate drug plays, but this one could be worth watching.   My wife has fibroid tumors and the current treatments are horrible, with hysterectomy being the most common end result.   A drug like this that could have 3 uses would be huge!

Take a look if u got some $ to spare
2021-04-07 06:58:51,wallstreetbets,"This is likely bunk. For the last 3 years every biotech startup looking for investors has a prostate cancer drug. Prostate cancer is an epidemic in China and the CCP has made curing it a high priority. This made funds abundant and indiscriminate with hustlers drooling for a pay day.

At my last job I sat through 2 separate negotiations with Chinese companies looking to fund an American counterpart to do their prostate drug research. Desperate for cash we accepted. I got the fun job of protecting our IP from the spy they sent 2 months later. In the intro meeting he said ""I am here to take the IP back with me that wasn't covered in the contract""

""Strategic partnership"" just means Pfizer will run their trials on higher mammals, apes, and 1st stage human. That is what my company was going to do for a few of its drugs."

2021-04-07 10:14:32,wallstreetbets,"I think it‚Äôs an issue of an inefficient market and my personal bull fan theory would be management already having agreed on a buyout.
If they did agree on a buyout at a specific price when they signed the Pfizer deal, they wouldn‚Äôt want to ramp the stock price up. A buyout at 100% looks much better than 50%.

The only true negative catalyst has been switching the CEO in January. Who was a biotech veteran and known for commercialization expertise.

It doesn‚Äôt make sense. That‚Äôs why I think there is so much value here. They are trading under the price they were before FDA approval and a partnership with Pfizer. Even if there‚Äôs no buyout, the play is built on a solid fundamental value gap."
2021-04-07 10:14:56,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the good question!! Happy you read this and looked at the charts.
2021-04-07 16:42:58,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a STEAL right now.
2021-04-06 20:08:20,wallstreetbets,"This is what I expect in a WSB reply.

Fair enough on the claims, I can substantiate if this gains real traction and it makes those feel better about it. However, I always expect others to do their own due diligence. 

Deep value does have a different meaning here now, sadly.... I‚Äôm all about GME, but there is a huge reason for the name being deep value. It‚Äôs the type of stock play haha. 

For the bad stuff, you‚Äôre right, I should have included it, but I typed this on my phone and I‚Äôm fuckin lazy. 

Since you asked, I‚Äôd say that the CEO being replaced shortly after the Pfizer deal was concerning to me. Lynn was phenomenal and personally I think she was ousted because sumitomo was upset about the Pfizer deal, or because the deal involved pfizer getting half the rights and sumi getting to buy the company. This works because Pfizer had a right of first refusal to purchase as part of their seed funding agreement with myovant.
Ultimately my main concern is that 3 of the board members are sumitovant plants, and that they might try to buy the company for less than its worth.
Furthering concerns, the stock is heavily manipulated due to its low volume. It‚Äôs very easy to walk the price down using algos. 
It also has a high short interest, which will cause a squeeze in the case of a buyout and could possibly send the PPS over the buyout offer. 

At the end of the day, I appreciate the advice, but I‚Äôm probably not going to change. I‚Äôm lazy."

If you want me to bring more value to the ""community"", how about this... Here is actual DD about the actual drugs from someone who actually works in prostate cancer research. Shoutout to u/IamTtDJ

Here is a [direct link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stock_Market_DD/comments/mlxjrq/myov_deep_value_and_possible_buy_out/)  that is better formatted. Good luck with your play. I hope you put your entire savings into it based on the DD of u/awoketaco.  

BEGIN POST:

**I work in prostate cancer research. I think your assessment of the drug is pretty inaccurate.** Here's why:

Yes, in the trial testosterone levels were lower. But lower testosterone levels are not really a good outcome measure to show clinical benefit for a patient.. What we're really interested in here is progression to the hormone refractory (also known as castrate resistant) stage. The data I've seen do not suggest that it's much better at actually controlling advanced prostate cancer.
Cardiovascular incidents were lower, although even in the control arm they're still fairly infrequent (~3% vs ~6% in the control arm). Overall the two drugs are similar in terms of adverse events, treatment discontinuation was higher in the orgovyx.
your post makes it sound like there's only two options of drugs in this space. This drug belongs to a group known as hormone therapy or Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT), of which there are three main types:

LHRH agonists
Goserelin (Zoladex¬Æ)
Leuprorelin acetate (Prostap¬Æ or Lutrate¬Æ)
triptorelin (Decapeptyl¬Æ or Gonapeptyl Depot¬Æ)
Buserelin acetate (Suprefact¬Æ)
GnRH antagonists -
This includes this drug (orgovyx) and the control in the trial leuprolide. In the U.K at least I think the most commonly used is degarelix (Firmagon¬Æ)
Anti Androgens - These are almost always taken orally, like orgovyx
bicalutamide (commonly used in the U.K) (Casodex¬Æ)
cyproterone acetate (Cyprostat¬Æ)
flutamide (Drogenil¬Æ)
As you can see, there a lot of options for Hormone Therapy. All of these are competition for orgovyx, not just the drug in the comparator arm of the trial. I don't know what standard of care (SOC) hormone therapy is in the US, but I don't see how orgovyx will become SOC just because it perform better than 1 other GnRH antagonist in a trial. There are a lot of other treatments that may be more or less effective.

There is competition of other drugs to Hormone Therapy. I'm not sure about the US, but in the UK/EU as far as I'm aware SOC treatment for metastatic patients is moving away from traditional hormone therapies (listed above) and towards upfront docetaxel chemotherapy followed by treatment with Novel Hormonal Agents (NHAs -abiraterone, enzalutamide, likely apalutamide soon too). Use of ADT in metastatic patients is only likely to decrease as more effective treatments are brought through.

**This is not a game changing drug for prostate cancer at all. This is essentially just a variation of a well-established class of drug that doesn't appear to be any more effective in controlling metastatic prostate cancer - in a very crowded space.**

On the other hand, hormone therapies are commonly used drugs by a lot of patients and often for a long period of time. American healthcare is strange in terms of drug approval and choice by clinicians (NHA's are expensive), so despite everything above they may still sell lots of this drug. Personally, I don't see how it would be SOC. I wouldn't be keen to buy this stock based on its drug for prostate cancer and I'd like to know if you have counterarguments to the points above.

I have absolutely no idea how it will perform in other indications or what the treatment space looks like in those indications. I have nothing to add on the likelihood of any takeover etc."

2021-04-07 09:05:16,wallstreetbets,"Idek if you read this... they are approved by the fda to treat prostate cancer. This isn‚Äôt a startup, it‚Äôs a fully commercialized treatment.

2021-04-07 09:17:16,wallstreetbets,"Check my comment thread above. I definitely have a bear case. 

Luckily for you, this isn‚Äôt big pharmacy. They are a startup with 200 people. So if they get bought out, you‚Äôre taking money out of big pharmas pocket."
2021-04-07 04:15:49,wallstreetbets,"Looks like Lupron, the injectable, is about 1600 a dose. Relugolix has a list of about 2500/month. One thing to be seen is if the injectable will be approved for home use instead of OP office use."
2021-04-07 13:12:56,wallstreetbets,"What do you mean second line?
Have you reviewed the data behind the clinicals for the relugolix combination tablet therapy? It‚Äôs been given priority review and is much stronger than the current SOC."
2021-04-07 09:02:59,wallstreetbets,My strikes are literally all over the board. I have some as low as 15 and some as high as 35. If I was expecting a buyout I would expect at least a 100% premium similar to Urovant.

2021-04-07 11:31:30,wallstreetbets,"Dude not gonna lie, you really are an asshole. I gave you credit at first, but I really don‚Äôt think you understand the space as well as you claim.

This isn‚Äôt a cure for prostate cancer. It‚Äôs a treatment.

Sure our friend may work in cancer research, so do you think they understand how billing works? Switching to a gnrh treatment changes this to Rx billing. Not only that, it‚Äôs much more attractive to patients to take a pill then a shot. Especially one a lot less likely to kill them from a heart attack.

I‚Äôm not asking anyone to yolo their life savings. Just sharing knowledge. I would encourage everyone to do their own DD and make their own decision. 

All of that being said, there are other ways to express your opinion than the path you‚Äôve chosen. The path you chose is aggressive and antagonistic to what the community stands for. We need to build each other up and not tear each other down."

2021-04-06 23:30:50,wallstreetbets,"When you say ‚ÄúPharma‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt mean the ten companies that went up 500%+ due to speculation on a vaccine.

1- leupron and zoladex are LHRH AGONISTS. since they induced ‚Äúmedical castration‚Äù by lowering the androgens levels, They have some unwanted side effects. they are injectable.  

2- relugolix is oral and a LHRH ANTAGONIST. very limited side effects and added benefit on cardiac side effects. The ONLY hormonal therapy given orally.   

3- the other anti-androgen treatments, which are oral medications are NOT given by themselves but rather administered IN COMBINATION with Hormonal therapy.   

4-chemotherapy is ONLY given when the tumor has metastasized. This is not a treatment that competes with the other treatments.

It is really important to remember, this isn't betting on gourds, or something crazy. This has life changing impacts for the end user. It is a socially benevolent application of science. 

Since you seem to be really interested in commenting and giving feedback, I have a couple of key takeaways for you after reading your replies:

1. If you don't want to invest, don't. No one is making you. Im not begging for investors, I am sharing knowledge. Yes, that has always been a part of this sub. 
2. Dont act like your hot shit. You're not more of an expert here after five minutes of reading someone elses comment. Humble yourself, read more than one opinion, and go do some research, as I previously encouraged.
3. Learn how to give productive feedback and not be an asshole, and maybe people will stop calling you an asshole and downvoting your shit lol."

Either way, I‚Äôm still very bullish on this approval. The backing from Pfizer on the trials and publications also helps. This is a company quickly moving on large partnerships and commercialization."

I bought despite this but got stopped out and will look to re.enter on Friday. See someone suggested selling calls. I think if you sell some calls above what you paid it would be good protection. The only risk is that you lose your shares at a higher price than what you paid plus you get the premium. Based on the options curve it is very likely it finishes the week around $30 at best.

2021-04-07 15:02:02,wallstreetbets,Rising from $31 to $40 in three days would increase their market cap by about $1b. Note that it's already increased by about $0.75b in the last week.

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Right Wing Billionaire, Charles Koch, Is Backing INTERSTATE COMMERCE FOR CANNABIS. TilAphria üöÄüöÄüöÄ Trulieve üí©üí©üí© [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.politico.com/amp/news/2021/04/06/charles-koch-snoop-dogg-marijuana-legalization-479148](here is the article)

Snoop Dogg and Charles Koch's group ""Americans for Prosperity(AFP)"" are working together to form the Cannabis Freedom Alliance (CFA). I know everyone is **shocked** by Snoop Dogg's support, but let's focus on the highly influential right wing group: AFP. 

>""Americans for Prosperity, founded by the Koch brothers in 2004, is one of the most influential organizations in conservative politics. The group rivals and even eclipses the official GOP in terms of its size, scope and spending.""

Directly from the article. So now cannabis is getting support from conservatives, in a big way, and conservatives **love** free and open markets. They will tell you where you can put your regulations, just ask em. So, on top of a **much better** chance of getting 10-12 Republicans to vote in favor of Cannabis, which is great news for everyone, this is also **AMAZING** news for Candian LP's like TilAphria, and bad news for MSOs like TruShit. I mean Trulieve. 

Don't believe me? According to one of the founders of the CFA (from the article): 

>""A lot of big cannabis companies are fighting against things like interstate commerce because it doesn‚Äôt support their business model,‚Äù Angelos said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs another reason why [AFP] is a perfect ally on this because they support free and open markets.‚Äù

*Weeeeeeeeird*. Do you guys think it's ""big cannabis companies"" like TilAphria or other large LPs fighting the interstate commerce, or *maybe* ones like Trulieve who are desperately clinging on to their dying business models? If interstate commerce is allowed, it will cost LPs only **shipping costs** to send their products to all 50 states, and their juicy markets. They already sit on an excess of product and grow space, just waiting for bigger markets. 

Meanwhile, Trulieve spent 60m+ on 2 retail stores, then diluted. ü§¶. So whatever markets they just spent 60m on, will eventually be available to everyone else (LPs and MSOs) for the **cost of shipping** to their stores or other new stores in the same area, post legalization with interstate commerce. No real long term cannabis company is focused on building a retail focused business. Just ask Curaleaf (read their ER) why their EU expansion is so exciting. They have **no** intentions of vertically integrating AND INSTEAD are building large manufacturing and distributing centers to serve large regions. Ya know, like Coke or Marlboro or Corona or literally any other CPG giant. Y'all been in a Coke owned store lately? Hm. How about the Corona ones? Hm.... Well, surely the Marlboro store? Those are everywhere!......

The kind of the interesting thing about the switch from a medical market to a recreational market is that 100% of the time, some of the the biggest opponents of the switch from medical to recreational are the current medical companies. Why would they want a bunch of new competition, regulations, and taxes? They don't. They fight the bills in the name of ""patients rights"" or some other made up bullshit. 

Then there's the other side of the coin. Once the switch from medical to recreational finally does happen, medical companies tend to find a lot less recreational companies wanting to work with them than they'd like. When you have to sit on the sidelines while someone else builds a monopoly, you aren't too keen to help them. 

Recreational business owners aren't stupid either. They are fully aware of those helping reinforce the ""status quo."" So, imagine you were to open a recreational marijuana dispensary after waiting for **years** in Florida, and a Trulieve sales rep walks in with their shitty logo on his shirt, how likely would *you* be to put their products on your shelf? I mean, why would you when there would be countless other brands to choose from with no retail presence? You wouldn't. It would make no sense. People who want Trulieve product can just go to a Trulieve store. Plus, wouldn't you purposefully **not**carry the same thing as your direct competitor, and especially their own in house brands? Unless you're ""Cookies,"" I just don't see that happening, and Trulieve AINT ""Cookies."" 

From a customer or ""patient"" perspective, in Florida, are you going to a Trulieve store for the 1,536th time after legalization, or ""Starbuds"" that just opened down the road with ""100+ new brands!"" sign out front?  Best case scenario would be Trulieve also adds a huge new line of other companies brands to their shelves, but is that really *good* news for them? They'd lose say 30-60% of their shelf space across all 70+ stores. That's gonna cause a surplus of weed for them pretty quickly.

They currently make so much money because they essentially own a monopoly on stores, and a monopoly on products within those stores. You want weed and live in FL? There's a 50% chance you're going to a Trulieve store, and a 100% chance you'll get a Trulieve product in that store. I've never seen something more ""priced in"" in my entire life, yet people still think Trulieve is going higher. Trulieve is only $40+ because of the *current* market regulations. Take away the favorable regulations, and you take away Trulieve, and get TruShit. 

Post legalization, each Trulieve store will just be one of **X** amount in a town selling weed. Florida currently has a dispensary ratio of around 1.1. Fully legal states have ratios closer to 10. Thats 10x the competition, just to get customers in the door. Even **if** they do come in Trulieve's door, they may not even buy a Trulieve product since they would be forced to carry other brands as well as their own.

Not every MSO is fighting for a fully legal market, and it's pretty obvious to point out the ones who could potentially be **hurt** the most by a free and open market. TruShit being king among them. In my retarded opinion, wholesale focused MSOs and LPs are much much much better long term options for a legal market. Stop investing in a dying medical market, ü§∑.

2021-04-07 10:53:39,wallstreetbets,"Sure. It isn't hard to imagine how LPs will make purchases in the US. Just look at Curaleaf's approach to the EU as a blueprint of what's coming for LPs entry into the US. 

First off, it would make no sense for most LPs to purchase a ""large"" MSO. Most ""large"" MSOs have built their books by operating vertically integrated markets, and have heavy retail burdens. Retail stores will have little to no value in a legal market. There will be tens of thousands of stores nationwide, so spending 60m+ (Trulieve) on 2 locations is retarded. Like 400%+ breakeven FD's with 0 DTE retarded. 

For comparison, 4Front spent 60m to being construction on their **OVER 500K SQFT** growing facility in Illinois. Their 60m investment will allow them to supply *nations* with Cannabis, in an open legal market. What is Trulieve's 60m purchase of 2 dispensaries going to look like in 2024-2025? It's gonna look like wasted money, that's what. 

Also, I bring up Cronos because they are most likely to make a large MSO purchase. Out of the ""large"" LPs, Cronos is the weakest. Cronos has also said they are focused on brand building. So If *any* LPs were to purchase a large MSO it would be them. It also helps they are sitting on about 1.2B of Altria's money for M&A. 

However like I said before, it just doesn't make sense for LPs to purchase large footprint MSOs. They are already sitting on an excess of cannabis and grow space, they just need the markets MSOs operate in. Not the MSOs themselves"

2021-04-07 11:13:55,wallstreetbets,"The only thing a retail heavy MSO would bring to the table is distribution. 

Trulieve would be the biggest distribution play, based on store count. However, 99% of their stores are in Florida. But even at 80+ stores, Trulieve is a tiny little roach compared to distribution agreements Altria and Constellation already have. Imagine Altria's distribution to a corner store like 7 Eleven (who sells alcohol, cigarettes, and even CBD). not even mentioning the countless other gas station and corner store brands. **Just** 7/11. That **one** agreement alone **DWARFS** Trulieve's network. 

Constellation has the same agreements, plus bars and other venues that are alcohol only. They won't need to reinvent the entire agreement to supply THC products. They simply need interstate commerce to be allowed. That's it. Once a company like Cronos (Altria) or Canopy (Constellation) gets the greenlight to start shipping, their products will be in every legal state within the week. 

7 Eleven does not have endless shelf space, and their tobacco shelf space is already **highly** dominated by Altria. MSOs **do not** have these kinds of agreements, and they are going to have a hard time finding shelf space in places where Altria already dominates the shelf. How often do you see new tobacco companies added to corner store shelves? Never. It's like cosmetics in a grocery store, meaning you can take their shelf space over their dead bodies. 

If you're actually looking at investing in an open and legal market (whenever that is. 2022-2030), then you'll see LPs are actually in a much much much much better place to capitalize on US markets with very little capital needed to do so. Unlike MSOs who have been paying 60m to open 2 stores in a new state. *Cough Trulieve Cough*"

I have had it both ways:

Last year I was up $30k DIS calls and held overnight thinking there would be more. Ended up barely breaking even.

I sold my NKLA calls for like $1200 but literally 2 hours later they were worth $70k.

They both hurt but I think holding too long hurts more and creates a bad habit"

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$SPY - The Coked Out Bull Who Outran Inflation - S&P 500 Trade Thesis What‚Äôs poppin‚Äô fellas, I‚Äôve got a trade thesis for y‚Äôall which I need picked apart. Although I spent a great deal of time discussing it with the greatest minds Twitter and Discord had to offer, I still can‚Äôt shake the feeling that this trade is pretty fuckin‚Äô stupid at face value, so bare with me.

&nbsp;

I was a little drunk on Easter, and had an epiphany :

- SPY 100 - 200 took roughly 14 years.
- SPY 200 - 300 took 3.5 years.
- SPY 300 - 400 took a little over a year.

&nbsp;

With the rate things are going, SPY 400 - 500 is looking like it‚Äôs set to happen in under a year, maybe even faster. Hell, in our current investing environment, I would be shocked to see SPY lower than 500 by the end of the year. Asset inflation is running rampant which is indirectly driving up the value of equities, we‚Äôre printing fuckloads of money with no end in sight, and money is flowing into the markets out the ass as investing becomes increasingly mainstream. I know a lot of people will doubt me for these things, but I‚Äôm thoroughly convinced that this is what modern day inflation looks like.

&nbsp;

/u/DustyBowls had an awesome writeup on this which can be found below :

---

&nbsp;

**The stock market is not a bubble. This is inflation. This is what modern inflation looks like. The federal government - Dem or Repub matters little, as Bush, Obama, Trump and now Biden all did this - they hide the true inflation by excluding things from the inflation basket such as real estate. All the easy money, low interest rates and supermassive spending by Bernanke, Yellen, now JPow.**

&nbsp;

**This is why the upper middle class and to a much greater extent the rich can profit at all times - they're so heavily into stocks and other financial devices plus housing and land that the massive devaluation of the dollar and the explosion in inflation is not their problem - they just rise with the tide. Regular middle class and worker bees (the 99.6%) are seeing massive pay cuts in the form of inflation. You got a decent job making high five / low six figures and want to buy a place? Even in mid-size midwestern towns, the housing market is so hot that you just got priced out of the market. And you'll never get back into because this is not a bubble that will burst - this is inflation. The Federal government is going to print even more money and devalue the dollar so that its debt / GDP doesn't get too fuked. The rich don't care. The well-positioned middle class (a minority of the middle class) don't care. Everyone else should. You got a $600 or $1400 or $2500 stimulus check? Cool story the housing price and your rent just went up 10% compound for the next five years and you're far worse off than you were.**

&nbsp;

**It ain't a bubble it's a rising sea. If you aren't in a yacht or at least a skipper, you're fukin‚Äô drowning man. Your flat salary, your savings account, your hourly wage - you just got a LOT poorer.**

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

By riding the coattails of the rich, we can look to become a lot less poor in the process. We‚Äôve identified the trend, and now *we* can also rise with the tide. Ultimately, our end goal seems to be SPY 500. The price action over the past year reinforces this, as we‚Äôve gone from $264 to $405 (over a 55% increase) during that time period. Hell, even the past decade of data supports us. **Every year from 2008 onwards, bar 2015 and 2018 have easily netted a 20% return.** If we see an increase that‚Äôs even remotely as good, we will be well ITM by the time our year is up. SPY 01/21/2022 500Cs are trading for $1.00. Dirt fuckin cheap. For more risk averse traders, we can go with a SPY 450C 01/21/2022 for $5.00 instead. Regardless of the chosen strikes, if these plays hit, it‚Äôs at minimum a 10 bagger, likely more.

&nbsp;

Personally, I‚Äôm going to look for an entry around SPY 400 since we‚Äôve left some gnarly gaps, but I‚Äôm thoroughly convinced that we may continue to rip. We need less than a 20% increase in 10 months, which is well within reach. We‚Äôre in a fucked up investing landscape, which is heavily skewed towards exponential growth. All we need to do is take the leap of faith, and reap the reward in a couple of months. 

&nbsp;

All that being said, **I can‚Äôt think of a good bear thesis, so this is where I turn to y‚Äôall**. I‚Äôm not worried about the ‚Äúbubble‚Äù popping, as I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre in a bubble; This entire system is just a byproduct of the insane amounts of money we have printed. In my eyes, the only thing that can stop SPY 500 from happening is us getting nuked by North Korea, a new strain of super aids wiping out a good chunk of civilization, or aliens coming down and fucking some shit up. If any of those things happen however, we‚Äôve got bigger problems than our SPY 500Cs expiring OTM. If anyone has a decent bear thesis, please lay it on me. 

&nbsp;

**__TLDR__**: Fuckloads of printed money combined with asset inflation will be a pretty nuts combo for the markets. Bears r fuk. Buy **SPY 01/21/2022 500C**."
2021-04-06 22:30:02,wallstreetbets,"So is the argument against this thesis that SPY just won‚Äôt hit $500, or is it about timing? I‚Äôve read numerous pieces outlining how the market will produce negative overall returns for the next decade, which seems too bearish. I also see merit in OPs logic. But perhaps the outcome is somewhere in between. Maybe it just takes a little longer to reach 500. In that case, the June 2022 $500c is ~$3.25, the Dec 2022 is ~$6.25, and the Dec 2023 is ~$13.50. With VIX and IV so low right now, buying options is cheaper than usual. Anyone who sees merit in OPs thesis should at least consider buying options. I‚Äôm leaning towards the Dec 2022 calls myself. Feels like enough cushion for risking $625."
2021-04-06 23:47:56,wallstreetbets,"This is actually intelligent and i agree with your conclusions. I too see no bear side. The best i can think is that the gains you'll get are not as big as they seem because the money is devalued. But this is only an issue if you are holding shares and riding that 20% ""growth"" (i.e. inflation). If you indeed go 10x with the calls then who cares about 20% inflation."

It will not be a good time to be a tech worker in this society."
2021-04-06 20:48:09,wallstreetbets,"2 cents from a smooth brain, but the yearly percentages are totally skued this year. I mean, you put a dollar in anywhere last March/April and there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôre not up 55% at least. JPOW is making weekly ‚Äòall good‚Äô statements now, which should concern all, quiet is all good not weekly strokefests. A great job report was released on a closed Friday, so everything popped on Monday, but was down today. SLR ended and we just passed banks‚Äô lockup expiration on 3/31. They‚Äôve been saying ‚Äòall good‚Äô but I‚Äôm sure there are a ton of people that, like me, were getting hammered by banks over the last 4 months to change my fixed mortgage APR to a variable (so they can buy a 2nd lambo when it goes past 7%). If tomorrow is a down day we‚Äôre gonna grind way down by EOM because Thursday for sure will be a down day cause JPOW‚Äôs gonna say ‚Äòall good‚Äô again. I didn‚Äôt even mention China and US possible Olympics boycott.. 
Not financial advice.

TLDR: We don‚Äôt hit a new SPY 52 high tomorrow we are f‚Äôed for the quarter at least."

2021-04-07 08:23:39,wallstreetbets,"I agree with your comments. And when you realize that 80% of all actively managed mutual funds underperform the S&P 500, the best investment you can do is to go long the S&P (fuck options), also buy the QQQ, and then spend the rest of your time reading WSB and fapping to r/bustyasians or something."
2021-04-07 01:54:10,wallstreetbets,"Here is your bear case ... if treasury yeilds rise above 2.5% & the fed increase rates things will get ugly fast.  


A major currency rebasement/crisis is coming in the next 24 to 36 months. For perspective ... the German fed expanded the balance sheet ~13x from 1912 to 1921 by 1923 the currency was useless. From 2008 until now the fed has expanded the balance sheet by >11x & if the fed keeps printing at the current rate by the end of the year that will be 13.5x sense 2008. Michael Burry has gone dark after tweeting some depressing shit. 

Long story short as soon as rates increase that will be the match that starts the macroeconomic bomb as foreign countries currencies based on USD start to cave. This makes me bullish on cryptoassets, gold, & real assets."

2021-04-07 06:04:13,wallstreetbets,"I can't read but ....

* SPY 100 - 200 took roughly 14 years. (this is a doubling +100%) 14\*1= 14 years
* SPY 200 - 300 took 3.5 years. (this is +50%) 3.5\*2=7 years (double)
* SPY 300 - 400 took a little over a year. (this is +25%) 1\*4= 4 years (double)

2021-04-06 22:08:06,wallstreetbets,A US federal Sales or Value Added Tax (VAT) would provide revenue to the government and hit the wealthy where they can afford it.

2021-04-07 16:00:29,wallstreetbets,"You get less leverage buying shares. Buying a call that's deep enough ITM will get you something that more or less mirrors the price changes in the underlying. If the underlying goes up a dollar, the price of the call will go up a dollar. So you can either buy 100 shares of SPY for $40,600 or you can buy a $200 strike call that expires in 2024 for $20,100. You can essentially ""buy"" twice as many shares on the extreme end of safety with call options. You risk SPY collapsing, and as it gets closer and closer to your call strike price and expiration date its value decreases until it drops below $200. Then your $20,000 call expires worthless whereas your 100 shares of SPY have only lost half their value.

As your risk tolerance increases so does the leverage. Instead of buying a call that expires 2.5 years from now you can buy one that expires in 6 months. And instead of an extremely safe $200 call you can pick a more risky but still quite safe $350 call. This costs a bit over $6000. Now if SPY goes up 10% in the next 6 months you make over 50%.

The lower the strike, the lower you break even, the lower the leverage and vice versa.
You could buy a call that is OTM and a week til expiration for 5 bucks, and on the off chance SPY goes up $20 in a week you turn that into $500."

Otherwise those profits could land anywhere. Hell some people might actually invest by starting businesses. Or, buying actual real estate.

2021-04-07 07:31:52,wallstreetbets,Exactly. That makes it even harder to get that big of an increase.
2021-04-07 00:08:22,wallstreetbets,"A bear thesis to consider. 

I would say the popping will happen if wages can't keep up with inflation and we get Stagflation. Congress is pushing for a $15 minimum wage which will allow for inflation to rise more. If not, it will limit the cost increase a company can pass on to its consumers and hurt its profitability. Enough companies with bad profits will bring the SPY down.
Other things pressuring companies in the SPY.

Building material costs are going up affecting construction, significantly rising prices. Semiconductor shortages are affecting automakers right now, but will spread to other industries. Shipping container prices have gone up so much that it is affecting US exports. Because it is more cost effective to send them back empty than wait for them to be loaded with US goods(mostly ag. products).

The delinquency rate for FHA homes is over 17.5%, these are in forbearance. Once the forbearance ends they will default and the lenders will dump them on the market.

Lastly, the government borrowed $3 trillion last spring, but didn't spend it all right away. This gave them a buffer to be able to spend without having to take out more debt and taking some pressure off Treasury Yields. That money will run out around June, forcing the government to borrow more which will need to be monetized by the Fed. What will the Fed do to ensure a market for the Treasuries? That will determine whether your call prints or not."

2021-04-07 00:18:09,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not necessarily a bull but just want to point out that rate increases should not be considered part of any decent bear thesis.

Compare forbearance now to forbearance circa 2007-2008 and its not that bad. I‚Äôve dug into this data quite a bit in the last year or so and can link you to much of it if you want when I‚Äôm at my desktop tomorrow. The quality of borrower is very substantially higher. The housing market is absolute insanity right now but banks and credit unions have not repeated the same mistakes they did in the years preceding the GFC by lending money to literally anyone. 

Supply shortages I generally agree with the reasoning on. The Fed is absolutely manipulating the reported inflation rate and prices across the country in most industries are substantially higher. Anyone working supply side for any trade has seen this since the start of the year. 

The best bear thesis I‚Äôve seen, and probably the one I agree with is that Archegos is not a unique situation and we‚Äôre likely to see another Archegos-esque failure which will cascade into a feedback loop of overleveraged fund liquidating all positions which sends the market deep red and causes this process all the way down other funds. We are in a liquidity crisis and the recent bull run with the push through 4000 on SPX was done on horribly low volume. I think we see another flash crash in a March 2020 esque sale and then a long term bear market as funds de lever."

It's far easier for them to continue to exponentially increase the balance sheet and get more aggressive with QE, direct fiscal financing and flirt with yield curve control while debasing the dollar. It kicks the can (again) and leaves the next generation holding the keys to the lemon."

I think this might just be the push needed to stop those excesses.

If this is swiftly followed by taxation based on where products are sold, instead of where the company is registered the Bahamas and Panama can go fuck themselves as well. This is something already proposed by several EU countries and rapidly gaining traction now that Trump isn't there to cockblock it and threaten with sanctions.

2021-04-07 13:13:03,wallstreetbets,"When Shorts envy others of what they bought by the fruit of their labor, they sprint into action. They encourage others to buy as high as possible. An honest person would state that the price is higher than what they would pay for and that they would sell it. However, a dishonest con-artist would would sell other people investments and get their army of social media posters, deceiving analysts, TV hosts and hostesses to put on their sheep cloths and to advice the hard laborers that unfortunately this was a bad investment and must accept the loss and sell so that the handlers of those advising would purchase back what they just labeled as ""Trash and worthless."" While this bonze scheme worked for a long-time, the people rebelled and saying, ""You cheated and now pay. Overcoming evil is an honorable work that unite the people of good well,"

It's not like a woodwind, where there are four of them playing. If you're playing the triangle in a composure, youre it.

You're *the guy*. 

That shits wired up to an amp and if you miss your timing by one beat, it will not work and you will fuck up the performance with the stupidest instrument of all time.

2021-04-06 20:17:33,wallstreetbets,"I think it's bittersweet and dipped in dramatic irony. To think it's a purely happy ending is to endorse the psychopathic, abusive, brutal pursuit of greatness which I strongly don't believe the film is endorsing. 

Redemption, yes, but also very tragic in the classical greek sense.

(What an amazing movie)"
2021-04-06 20:19:01,wallstreetbets,"When I saw it with friends, I commented on the fact that this is a tragic ending was not present enough in the way it was shot, and was dismissed.

The *entire* point of the movie is that he was pushing himself too hard, and needed to get out. His father is looking on in horror as he destroys himself for that solo. His drum set is *covered* in blood.

https://www.slashfilm.com/whiplash-ending/ the writer/director agrees. ""And at 30, he dies of a drug overdose."""
2021-04-07 01:16:48,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not a redemption. That smile and understanding look they share at the end alludes to the fact that the drummer has fallen back into the unhealthy obsession and willingness to do *anything* in order to be one level closer to *absolute perfection* that was brought about by JK Simmons‚Äô character.

JK Simmons‚Äô character, throughout the film, is clearly a huge narcissistic piece of shit. The man thinks he‚Äôs a musical god. He manipulates the drummer, plays mind games with him, makes him believe that he‚Äôs worthless (when he‚Äôs actually an amazing drummer), just to push him even further into breaking his own soul in an attempt to achieve ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù musician status.

Near the end of the movie, the drummer finally gets away from it and tries to live a semi-normal life.

But then, at the end of the movie, this look that they share lets the audience know that the drummer has tragically fallen right back into JK Simmons‚Äô trap.

It‚Äôs heartbreaking, actually. The kid is a brilliant musician but JK Simmons‚Äô character has convinced him that the only person in the world qualified to say that he is a brilliant musician is JK Simmons‚Äô character. So in the end, the look they share shows that the drummer still needs the approval of JK Simmons‚Äô character, instead of realizing on his own that he is a fantastic musician."
2021-04-06 22:59:58,wallstreetbets,"I thought it was a pretty dark ending after what he had gone through to get that approval.
Like he gets what he wanted but was it worth it all? Great movie but I do think it‚Äôs tragic"
2021-04-07 08:33:03,wallstreetbets,Fletcher mouths two words in that last shot. You can‚Äôt see it. I think it‚Äôs ‚Äúgood job.‚Äù Earlier in the film he says ‚Äúgood job‚Äù is the absolute worst thing to tell someone.
2021-04-07 16:21:18,wallstreetbets,"Wow, I just saw the dad was a wet-ass-pussy who was happy to cotton-wool his son from generative stress that would lead to his greatness in his childhood passion... 
Yet didn't defend him at all at the dinner table against his friend's mediocre football-playing family's insults and actually joined them, 
and even apologised to strangers when they knock his head with popcorn. 
And limphandheld him around life, preferring it when he was a dead end barrista. Terrible parenting."

There‚Äôs no good in playing really quickly when you aren‚Äôt playing with even rhythm because it wouldn‚Äôt sound good. If you‚Äôre able to play this quickly though, then you have such good dexterity that you can probably play most anything with great rhythm and consistent tempo"

2021-04-06 22:56:35,wallstreetbets,This scene in particular had my jaw on the floor. The last 20 min of this movie are an absolute rollercoaster
2021-04-06 22:24:00,wallstreetbets,Also one of the most stressful movies I‚Äôve seen. The tension builds the entire movie. I was mentally drained at the end. Fantastic movie.

2021-04-07 00:50:35,wallstreetbets,This comment sold me on it. Top 5 is a big claim haha. I just got done watching it. It was pretty damn good. I half expected Fletcher to murder the kid after the jazz club scene. I really liked the ending. His ‚Äúchucked a cymbal at his head‚Äù moment. Thanks!!!!

2021-04-07 01:26:05,wallstreetbets,Going in blind is important. This scene alone is probably the most defining given the dynamics between the two characters. Essentially the perfect crescendo to climax

2021-04-06 22:53:27,wallstreetbets,"The first time I watched it, I almost shut it off during the final concert as hes embarrassing himself trying to play along to the song he didn‚Äôt know. It was so cringe inducing. Then he goes back out and goddamn... great fucking movie."
2021-04-06 23:39:11,wallstreetbets,The Adam Sandler one where he is the diamond guy is similar.
2021-04-06 23:58:08,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a like a spring of tension being wound up for 120 minutes only to unwind explosively in pure musical/cinematic/narrative bliss. It‚Äôs beautiful.
2021-04-07 02:25:03,wallstreetbets,I loved Whiplash. Another on the same genre that I simply couldn't get thru was Black Swan. The tension in that was too much.

It‚Äôs a happy ending in the sense that he scored a victory and came out of the other side of being put through the ringer by Simmons‚Äô character. Although I see your point, the question of whether or not it was worth the abuse to get there is one of the main things the film is exploring"
2021-04-06 22:31:53,wallstreetbets,Exactly.  The price of greatness comes at the cost of everything else.

2021-04-06 23:16:19,wallstreetbets,I think that's the point of the scene.  To exaggerate what he is doing to himself so the audience knows he is beating himself physically to the point where his hands are going to be torn up.

2021-04-07 00:07:12,wallstreetbets,"He wasn't ""embarrassing himself playing a song he didn't know""
JK Simmons asked him to come in to play Caravan and then switched the song on him without telling him, to ""show him who's boss"" once more.  But he came back out, took control, showed himself, his parents, and the audience that he had mastered it...finally.  Only to receive the hard-fought approval of Simmons, after all of that abuse.  There isn't a happy ending, it's bittersweet in that behind every great performance is someone who has abused themselves to get to that point.
There's even blood on the cymbal.

Also, isn‚Äôt the recall just automatically announced about 60 days before the shareholder meeting?"
2021-04-06 23:23:31,wallstreetbets,Correct! Whiplash is not a movie about music or drums. Whiplash is a movie about abuse.

Would you ask someone who's never run before to go run a marathon, and expect them to manage that without a long painful recovery, and possibly injuries that may last for a long time. Lots of possibilities for joint, muscle, ligament, and tendon damage. I've heard of drummers getting stress fractures in their feet from using the kick drum, for example."

The recall is not something shareholders control, it would be the company, what I was suggesting is that the shareholders request a vote on something to force a recall to be done.

2021-04-06 22:54:53,wallstreetbets,Sounds about right lol. But would be nice if it could pop off and get back over $30 again
2021-04-06 23:51:31,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't have it any other way.

2021-04-06 22:15:33,wallstreetbets,I suppose one is more for thjngs like nuclear energy and the other is for weapons
2021-04-06 23:08:20,wallstreetbets,">It feels like PLTR is going to be the company that creates Skynet,

Clearly Misdirection. I have heard rumblings of a Billionaire deploying a large number of satellites in the Sky to create a Net.

Unrelated...I have been upvoting Boston Dynamics videos, and taking extra care of my electronics in front of my Ring ~~in case~~ they are watching."
2021-04-06 21:41:00,wallstreetbets,"Wait, your PLTR stock goes up?"
2021-04-06 23:02:40,wallstreetbets,Or how about selling $13/$14 CC‚Äôs when the price was $8 and watching it blow past those strikes and have to buy them back
2021-04-06 23:43:22,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm grateful for my Roth IRA account not allowing CCs. Otherwise I‚Äôd have screwed up already trying to pick pennies in front of a steamroller.

2021-04-06 21:25:38,wallstreetbets,"Was just about to post exactly this. Recently a lot of contracts have been given zero-cost extensions due to COVID interruptions. No new spending here, just a little bit more time for Palantir to finish their work."
2021-04-07 00:55:49,wallstreetbets,Except not /s
2021-04-06 23:32:20,wallstreetbets,They would rather reinvest in sky taxis then buy back shares.
2021-04-07 09:30:33,wallstreetbets,Yeah but their IP has value that isn't reflected on their balance sheet.
2021-04-07 04:43:37,wallstreetbets,Air force has a stargate program. Operating so many SG teams is very costly.

2021-04-06 23:39:31,wallstreetbets,You're pretty confused about what socialism is. Heres a hint. It's not military spending in republican districts.

2021-04-07 06:04:49,wallstreetbets,"No, this was supposed to happen."
2021-04-07 06:13:08,wallstreetbets,"Keep in mind, DFV's calls expire on April 16th, which will be a huge social catalyst. GME is moving sideways with IV coming way down. Every time this has happened this year, the price has always shot up +50% suddenly."
2021-04-07 06:46:28,wallstreetbets,Life savings gone?  Or just one account?
2021-04-07 07:07:59,wallstreetbets,"retard, nobody buys 800$ OTM calls"

2021-04-07 09:58:21,wallstreetbets,This has to be paper trading account.  No one would bet 40k on something so unlikely and unsafe.
2021-04-07 10:37:07,wallstreetbets,The day after April 16 it might moon lol
2021-04-07 10:51:26,wallstreetbets,"Fuck, I wish people would just give money away like this to me..."
2021-04-07 12:59:06,wallstreetbets,WSBs loses money repeatedly on GME and continue to come back for more. Buying puts made more money for people than buying stock ever did.
2021-04-07 13:25:53,wallstreetbets,Have faith. These will print.
2021-04-07 15:18:26,wallstreetbets,"These will print my bud, these will print."
2021-04-07 15:44:14,wallstreetbets,"Ngl, is this the reasons the hedgies are still doing attacks? They'll make more on his calls?"

2021-04-06 21:08:27,wallstreetbets,Way to buy stupidly OTM calls written by the people shorting GME...
2021-04-07 06:33:29,wallstreetbets,They only give you one if you provide the original recipt.
2021-04-07 08:32:41,wallstreetbets,I think it has already been 30 days so he shouldn't be able to get it.
2021-04-07 17:16:21,wallstreetbets,Can you say it was your 8 year old daughter that ordered it like I do with ITunes and get all my PUBG and COD crap for free?
2021-04-07 07:40:48,wallstreetbets,All he needs to do is close his browser and turn off his computer and the money will re-appear in his bank account within 7-10 working days
2021-04-06 20:00:56,wallstreetbets,Honestly these could print
2021-04-06 20:50:16,wallstreetbets,But then how will I look cool on WSB?
2021-04-07 03:59:24,wallstreetbets,That really depends on the time until expiration.  With enough time on your side you don't need GME to hit $800 to sell for a profit.
2021-04-07 08:24:14,wallstreetbets,ape has no idea on IV...gme might even go up and this 800c yolo fall. retard it is
2021-04-07 15:33:55,wallstreetbets,IV is a thing pokemon have

2021-04-07 09:23:53,wallstreetbets,Please don't Upvote things like this. We have perfectly acceptable insults already. Like Retard.
2021-04-06 21:17:47,wallstreetbets,If you know what you're doing you could grab some 800c for a few months out when IV is relatively low and sell on the first spike up.
2021-04-06 20:56:50,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-06 21:49:32,wallstreetbets,"Buy
..
...
800C"
2021-04-07 00:02:53,wallstreetbets,You're not gonna see the same numbers on shares as you would on FDs if GME actually spikes. He went for a lotto play. Simple as that
2021-04-06 23:02:47,wallstreetbets,Watch these print for a milly when squizzles next week
2021-04-06 22:03:33,wallstreetbets,"These are options plays, though. The choice won‚Äôt be left up to him by 4/16"

2021-04-06 20:58:55,wallstreetbets,"Shut up bot.

Mods?"
2021-04-07 10:38:54,wallstreetbets,The most he can do is sell it as used for store credit.
2021-04-07 01:25:08,wallstreetbets,I gave you your 69th like. It will happen.
2021-04-07 09:22:16,wallstreetbets,"Sure could


 if you hadn't bought those 800 calls lol"
2021-04-06 20:01:50,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve learned to never completely rule out any possibility when it comes to meme stonks

2021-04-06 21:57:26,wallstreetbets,dude! exactly.
2021-04-06 21:11:06,wallstreetbets,"I made a good amount selling 800c covered calls. I would be more than thrilled to sell my shares for $800 tbh. Nice juicy gain. 

Thetagang 4 life."
2021-04-06 23:57:52,wallstreetbets,MMs are the main sellers of the options. Retail option writing is minuscule
2021-04-06 23:23:54,wallstreetbets,Or Fabio
2021-04-06 21:47:08,wallstreetbets,We've been screaming that for weeks you can't fix stupid
2021-04-06 20:35:26,wallstreetbets,"It was in that popular post a few days ago. ""April 2020"" was in the title of the post. The GME election shareholder meeting is June 11, and the DD said they aren't allowed to recommend a share recall until a maximum of 60 days before the meeting, which is April 12.

Only lenders can force a recall, but GME can recommend it so the true share owners don't miss their chance to vote."
2021-04-06 23:56:04,wallstreetbets,"That's what I did with the 3/19s. My average was .67 and I sold at $10.00ish back during the February spike, sold way to early and could have gotten 20 but profit is profit"
2021-04-07 01:14:08,wallstreetbets,"This is what he was hoping for, this dude must have bought at the previous gamma runup, all time high"
2021-04-07 01:16:44,wallstreetbets,"You might want to take a look at how much he paid for  them initially..... he needs a gamma squeeze to 350+ just to breakeven, maybe even higher"
2021-04-06 22:16:18,wallstreetbets,"Bro, I'm in same boat with you. If your calls hit mine hit too 16/4  5 contracts already down 20k. Whateeeeva"
2021-04-07 01:17:56,wallstreetbets,Is this fk around money or does it matter?
2021-04-07 07:17:00,wallstreetbets,"Ahh dang.but you know what. So far GME has spiked every month so far. I do personally, expect this month to squeeze too and be huge since usually they squeeze every 30 days, this ones overdue. I believe this ones going to be the MOAS. Lets just hope that it works out for him. The more ITM calls, the stronger the gamma squeeze to trigger the MOAS"

If they try to recall shares, but the borrower has shorted the borrowed share, then the shorts must buy the stock back at *any* price so they can give it back to the lender, and the subsequent spike in share price is called a short squeeze. Lenders recalling shares is the whole goal we're trying to achieve."

===========TRADING DAY, WEDNESDAY APRIL 7=====================

TSLA GANG, today was choppy af. TSLA went for the gap fill almost to 661, but held up at 666-669 (which may be possible support for a gap up tomorrow IF no market BS comes up). Looking for a gap up to 690+ run up to touch 700. If TSLA bulls are strong along with the rest of the market, we can fight for the 700 line and end the week 720+. That's my take but then again I'm -40% deep in more retarded calls so hopefully law of attraction works and papa musk hears my prayers.

Locked in gains with ROKU calls and puts early on. Steep drop followed by a quick V recovery because I was playing both ROKU and TSLA calls and puts.

https://preview.redd.it/t4qs5dggatr61.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=678d8e9ab5e1f1eef4f981f9715c15eafee6ac65

Went in quick AMZN $2900 puts 4/16, in hindsight should've held it to anticipate sell off/breakdown towards EOD. I was too fixated on TSLA and ROKU.

&#x200B;

Like a retard, I kept adding on to my TSLA 700c 4/9 position and screenshoted this at  2:10 PM EST but failed to exit. Guess what happened after?

https://preview.redd.it/u2adga1watr61.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=808d39ae99f53cc45f57d56120182c165000dc73

Market sold off + TSLA trying to fill that gap to 661. Ended up holding these bad boys ayyy. That's what happened when you don't follow the golden rule;

IF ITS GOOD ENOUGH TO SCREENSHOT, ITS GOOD ENOUGH TO SELL. Had unloaded and took that -5% loss up there\^, I wouldn't 1. hold this massive fucking bag, and 2. rebuy the 4/16 calls to give me some time even if I believe in the bounce back up / gap up. Hell I could've yolo'd 230k worth with a cost of $3.  


My numbers plugged into Options Profit Calculator: [http://opcalc.com/sYl](http://opcalc.com/sYl)  
I suggest everyone learn how to use this so you can gauge the next day. Plug in your calls/and IV to get the most accurate numbers.  


Point your finger at April 8 column and go down to 690. If TSLA is at $690, my position is up 6.84% and so on. If TSLA would've done a end of day rally to say 685-690 or past the high of day to 695, then my position would be 50-98% up.. But it didn't so now I'm bagholding

2021-04-06 22:08:28,wallstreetbets,"lmfaoooo. I'm laughing irl because today was the FIRST day I started playing both sides of TSLA with calls and puts AND I hit the vape. 

The entire trading day was literally slo mo for me because I was faded as fuck.

To give insight: I honestly can't tell IF I am truly retarded or that I'm used to how TSLA moves because of an entire year of rollercoaster trading it...

I did have a hiatus/trading break for a few months because I got the covid and other responsibilities kept me from actively trading/observing the market.

I came back March 5th after TSLA dropped bigly. After seeing March 8th dip to $560~ and buying in, I saw the resistance levels at $690, $700, $710 (Tradingview charts will show it but it's quite obvious even by observation) 

Everytime TSLA made a move for $690/700/710, it would immediately get crushed down to lower support levels $680, $660, even $600 before bouncing back up. These were observations throughout March.

EVERY trading day is different and the overall market conditions / news also needs to be taken into account.

But to keep it short/simple- I.. believe it or not browse wsb/stocktwits like a true autist to gauge other retard's sentiments. 

News: They smashed deliveries/productions numbers and it was ""unexpected"" for everyone, bulls and bears, retards and analysts. Regardless, this is a little catalyst to get this little retard train chugging ALONG with SPY highs, QQQs rallying, April bullish month, run up to ERs. 

All of these factors are BULLISH for TSLA. Fuck what people say about PEs and valuations and all that nonsense. Literally doesn't matter here- the argument of comparing TSLA with other car companies is invalid. If you're a TSLA trader you have to understand TSLA GOES UP, but it also goes down just as fast. It's heavily shorted, a fuck ton of degens play TSLA options which attributes to the volatility, short squeezes and gamma squeezes.


Max pain: This stock is HEAVILY controlled by MMs to make as much money burning weeklies calls/puts. I've seen TSLA close BELOW $700, 2 weeks in a row just to fuck over all the call volumes.

Google says:
The Maximum Pain theory states that an option's price will gravitate towards a max pain price, in some cases equal to the strike price for an option, that causes the maximum number of options to expire worthless.

Max pain theory: http://maximum-pain.com/options/TSLA

For example today:

I would buy $690 puts whenever TSLA is around $695-700. I accumulated puts for the lowest price possible in 5-10 contract increments. I anticipated TSLA is gonna flush/sell off towards end of day along with SPY/QQQs. At that point I would close my puts and pick up cheap $700 weeklies to anticipate a gap up the next day.

But throughout the day, on every dip to support $680, 685, I load up on $700 calls- and unload when it gets close to $695-700, aiming for 10-15%. I'm not holding in hopes of a big runner. If it runs, and I miss out, oh well. If I do chase, I chase small. Either way I just commit to it- by the time I hesitate, the trades over and I'm bagholding or FOMOing

Hope that helps- been a long day so my thoughts are scattered a bit lol"

2021-04-06 23:59:41,wallstreetbets,I've traded for a bit but newer to tsla.

Dealing with losses is something I continually work on AS well as learning to exit in a timely fashion. Entries and exits need to be done mechanically and systematically.

I have this bad habit of.. doing 50-100 contracts at a time. I made a small change where I would precisely buy in 10-25 increments once I gauge a general range. Sometimes I'll see what's the lowest cost for that contract for the day and set limits 25-50 cents below it. People will say it's dangerous to catch falling knives.. I like knives."

2021-04-07 10:16:56,wallstreetbets,If you look at his track record he won the lotto more than 5 times. The dude is a genius or a really really good poker player
2021-04-06 22:50:04,wallstreetbets,"I just recently figured this one out. When you roll, you set a limit price of what your net debit (or credit, if you‚Äôre rolling to cheaper options) is and the brokerage does the rest in a single step.

So let‚Äôs say you want to roll 5 $10 contracts into 10 $6 contracts that are currently priced at $4.80 and $6.25. That will cost you a total of $100. So you set a limit order for a net debit of $100 and it does the work for you. It monitors both prices at the same time and processes the order so you pay no more than $100. It could sell 5 at $10 and buy 10 at $6, or it can sell 5 at 10.50 and buy 10 at $6.00 (which would only cost you $75) or any combination that equals no more than $100 additional from you. It‚Äôs great for fast-moving, volatile options so you don‚Äôt miss out on a spike or dip in either one and don‚Äôt have to worry about timing two different transactions."
2021-04-07 01:28:40,wallstreetbets,"If the call is deep in the money, it loses all time value and just becomes (share price - strike price) x 100. If you roll into an OTM strike at a later date (assuming you're bullish on the stock) you can make more extrinsic value plays."
2021-04-06 23:05:59,wallstreetbets,"and really simple terms:

he buys some way Out-of-the-Money (OTM) calls, stock price goes up, people are willing (and lol in some cases when shorting on margin, FORCED) to buy those contracts from him for more money than he paid. 

if stock price goes down, he can still sell those contracts at a loss and get some money back instead of waiting for them to expire.

I.E. he can close his position at a gain or a lose, it is dependent on the value of the stock when he opened his position vs the stock value when he closed position.

calls that are OTM have a high potential to lose a lot of value the closer they get to expiry."
2021-04-07 03:05:52,wallstreetbets,"Same question, thank you."
2021-04-07 11:52:48,wallstreetbets,because calls are instant money if the stock price rises faster than the value of the options decay. Its  EZ MONEY.

Taxes will hurt sure, but you'll still have more in your savings account in the end.

I paid 2.5$ for 2 $95
I paid $1.9 for 10 $100

I'll let you do the math. 

This was after my first 5x with them on their previous quarter. 

LOGI is a consistent 5-10x gainer if you buy .3 Delta 6m+ out. 

LOGI will most likely hit 180~ by EOY."

2021-04-07 10:51:01,wallstreetbets,"There are many ways to put this, but here is a simple one.

The less money you have, the higher % of that amount must go to sustain yourself. Cost of food and rent is everything if you have 10k. It's nothing if you have one million, assuming you don't start living like a king before you make your next million.

There is also so many more opportunities that you just can't jump on if you don't have a lot of money to spend. 

Any investment that multiplies a small sum does less than any investment that multiplies a large sum. Even accounting for risk there are plenty of low risk investments that will do more for you with a million than working extra few dozen hours on a normal wage."

Strange how it isn't linear(In terms of selling options back in accordance to time left and price of stock...) I heard maybe spreads work something like that... Gotta go research... x.x

I have to go try selling calls soon(And 0%/Low-Risk investment strategies - and start testing the other side... As an optimist who made 25k-40k off GME his 2nd week of doing calls, I really overestimated the market and the power of calls...

Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. 

My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds; pretty standard really. At the age of twelve I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Wilma ritualistically shaved my testicles.

It's a former Google X project that has a lot of funding and Gates/GOOG backing. The energy storage game is set to explode and cheap grid scale firms like this will dominate. Sure, there are others but not with these kind of resources behind them. 

The extra potential for thermal energy storage facilities is to boost existing fossil power plant output by harnessing all the energy thrown away in cooling towers. 

Just something to watch as the energy transformation hits full stride in the next decade.

I learned a long time ago that people can be complete pieces of shit with money despite being tolerable otherwise, and I'll never lend anyone money again.

The volume has disappeared, the stock is holding hard as fuck at 180-190, management is completely revamped, and the laws are turning against the shorts.  Nobody knows shit about WTF the future holds.  It could be a Chinese invasion tomorrow and you could be paying taxes in the yen next year for all we know.  

I do know this.  GME is a very high risk play but with high risk... can be high reward.  That and don‚Äôt forget, the squeeze was stopped by the market makers.  

Far from over, you‚Äôre not a believer and that‚Äôs ok. What‚Äôs no ok is you telling people they fucked up when you don‚Äôt know yet, or what these peoples position is.  Sounds like to me you never made any money on GME.  The people who made money on GME are still in some way or another.  

Or I‚Äôm wrong, tell me about your story of making money on GME?

-Take profits wherever you can

-Hedge your risk

-Set stop losses and never lose money

-Know what actually makes a stock a good buy (hint: ""short squeeze"" is not one of them)

Sticking to these habits is actually absurdly difficult for most people ."
2021-04-06 21:31:12,wallstreetbets,Lol DFV had a portfolio worth over 800k at least before he invested in GME. Go watch his old videos he had like 300 positions open and most of them profitable. Hes literally a licensed financial professional. Made me laugh when people were concerned about him when GME tumbled to 38.

2021-04-06 21:36:38,wallstreetbets,Almost anyone who learns how it works and keeps making plays will get lucky with a big win at some point . The trick is keeping that money and continuing to make more.  It‚Äôs extremely hard to hit multiple home runs and it takes incredible discipline to not lose money once you‚Äôve made it on a crazy play

2021-04-06 21:28:18,wallstreetbets,If you want to make the kind of return DFV did say trading has to be your life. You don't have to be a hedge fund or write algorithms you just have to know your shit about a particular play and get lucky as fuck.

And a tin foil idiot."
2021-04-07 05:50:31,wallstreetbets,"the real reason DFV hasn't sold his shares is probably because he's making a fortune selling CC's to his new cult, wants to own a decent part of GME and because he's already made enough money to retire on"

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Key differences between RKT and ASO I''m seeing a lot of posts on ASO, with some of them comparing to the RKT situation in early March. I want to clarify a few key differences here. This post is NOT saying ASO is a bad investment, I'm sure their excellent earnings indicate that their business is going strong. I'm only trying to show that, in my opinion, a RKT-like gamma squeeze is *unlikely*.

So first thing, we have to understand that the RKT squeeze is primarily a gamma squeeze - the price blew up 20% initially, getting close to the highest strikes available at the time, and then steadily grew to over 70% over the course of the day. If you look at the share cost distribution (below), you will notice a big block between \~$28 to \~$40. I've been tracking this since the squeeze and it has not changed. What happened was that institutions were selling naked calls (because RKT was trading flat forever before the spike), and they were forced to buy shares to hedge, creating a gamma squeeze. Institutional holdings recorded at the end of dec was about 74%, suggesting that there could have been a good number of exposed naked calls. If it were primarily driven by a short squeeze, this big block would not exist.

https://preview.redd.it/7x37a6m7olr61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18a030afd647c5d87ef3fff2f618483452de072d

On the other hand, what is ASO's situation? ASO has 91.6% institutional ownership. I would suspect most of the calls that are sold are already covered. ASO has been trending up since its IPO anyways so there wouldn't be as many naked thetagang as RKT before the spike. Thus, I highly doubt a gamma squeeze can happen. What about a short squeeze? Of course this can happen as the short interest is high, but unless millions of apes jump in like GME (unlikely since they are already in GME) or a whale buys in (also highly highly unlikely). The high institutional ownership also means that lots of shares will be available to be lent out, and shorts will have a hell of a time if any spike happens.

With this in mind, investors in ASO should tread lightly. I would probably suggest getting shares if you are bullish and not options."
2021-04-07 04:57:58,wallstreetbets,I just like guns tf $aso
2021-04-06 20:53:11,wallstreetbets,I think it‚Äôs valid to point out no two situations are identical. Is this going to go parabolic one day and dump the next? Maybe. Or it might slowly build 30-50% gains in two weeks and find a new floor for a while.
2021-04-07 08:13:01,wallstreetbets,"Wasn't $RKT's ""squeeze"" technically just day traders, MSM, and retail investors just hitting the stock at the same time? It wasn't actually a ""squeeze"" it just looked like one. $RKT hasn't moved by $0.30 since, even with the influx of posts on it on this sub a couple weeks ago. Retail investors I don't think contributed over all to the short-lived rise of the stock. Whales just followed the money based on popularity."
2021-04-06 20:55:56,wallstreetbets,Solid edit and valid points. UWMC is a good counter example. Enormous float making gamma squeeze difficult.

Me being cautious, I would start with 10% of what you are willing to invest in it. And buy 10% more every 10% drop. Or something similar. 

Just from a quick browse at recent history, you could guess that it's more likely to hit $20 again before it hits $24.

Could they announce that they leaked confidential data from 500K customers on a Friday afternoon and get a 40% spike by Monday? Yes. Is it likely? Also yes."

2021-04-06 22:46:29,wallstreetbets,"There is no God. We're all Atheists at birth... until someone else convinces us to believe in some hocus pocus bullshit to fit into a (their) ""tribe"". Usually it's during childhood, when there is little defense against indoctrination and psychological manipulation. Religious people grow up to believe what was done to them was a positive thing, and then they continue the tradition of ideological brain-binding with their children in turn.

What we have now, around the world, is successive generations of fully adult human beings still believing in what amounts to the Easter Bunny. Simply because to escape that mental state - unwavering faith - would mean confronting the reality that their entire worldview, the core beliefs of their ""tribe"" (including friends and family and associates) are predicated on mass delusion.

So it's natural to react with fear and anger at someone who not only doesn't believe, but shrugs off the best efforts of the religious to change their minds. The mere existence of an atheist is a perceived as a threat to the sanctity of the unquestionable dogma and mythology of religion.

Meanwhile to atheists, religious people just sound like... well, I'll put it this way... you know how Qanon people sounded to the rest of the world? That's what religious people sound like when you aren't a part of the delusion. It's difficult to put a positive spin on it. I don't place religious folks any higher than flat-earthers in the hierarchy of relative social value/contribution, as a function of their misinformed perspectives... actually a net negative, if you really think about it."

The blockbuster thesis was real until the last couple years when activist investors took interest and started a turnaround.  100% idiotic board, which didn't even bother closing down duplicate stores from the EB acquisition.  Currently closing the stores and leading to lower growth, obviously, cuz they are trying to shrink.  

Revenue decline is the same, as the gaming sector is tied to the console cycle.  Peaks during release and steadily drops afterwards.  
This year is the start of a new cycle and with so much debt repaid early, lower overall revenue (from fewer stores!) means overall healthier financials.  Especially with the growth of the e-commerce division starting to leverage the rewards membership.  

The underlying reason for the GME saga is boomers and suits fundamentally not understanding gaming or gamers."

The problem is, of course, that dumb teenagers don't know when they're being made fun of, so they gleefully joined in. And a couple of them is OK - it gives the non-teens meme fodder (eg. ""holds up spork""). But then there's an inflection point where the dumb teens outnumber the original members and it's not fun anymore. You're not making fun of idiots with other non-idiots anymore, now you're just talking to idiots. So more of the original folks leave, and the ratio skews even further. Cue anger, spinoff sites, fragmentation.

WSB has a lot of the same problems. Using terms like retards, autists, cucks ironically attracts the people who use them unironically. The fragmentation has already begun, but fortunately it started with the GME crowd splitting off, so given strong enough moderation maybe there's a chance."

GameStop has no place in either of those. GameStop is just entering a market that all of their competitors have been in for over a decade, and they don‚Äôt offer any advantages.

Why would the big 3 even allow them to have a separate store on their platforms?  

You don‚Äôt go to a 3rd party retailer to get your Big Mac, you buy it straight from the source.  The less middlemen the less the price.  And McDonald‚Äôs certainly isn‚Äôt going to allow Burger King to sell cheeseburgers in their restaurants.

Rewards programs are a dime a dozen, there is nothing special about GameStop‚Äôs that anyone else couldn‚Äôt duplicate, and ps+ and gamepass have given me far more bang for my buck that GameStop rewards ever has.

People get all bent out of shape when you talk about GameStop not being a sound company.  This doesn‚Äôt mean your shitting on the current play.  It‚Äôs like people are scared that if we don‚Äôt convince everyone that GME is a long term play then this squeeze won‚Äôt happen.

  This is a short squeeze play, not a long term investment.  Pretty much everyone understands that the GameStop experience isn‚Äôt enjoyable and doesn‚Äôt fill any niche.

The perspective of the unreligious is so far away from that of the religious that they cannot conceive of how a mind works that isn't confined by faith and dogma.

Who works off the data given to them by the people who would rather NOT let it be known that they did NOT cover? So they ""covered"" and somehow still rocketed again in february off a relatively meaningless announcement. And since then the volatility has been unattached to its volume, no fundamental logic applies to GME. What we do see is constant FUD trying to be kind and generous people to make me sell GME. Where do we see that for any other stock in history? 

 There's also massive volume being held. It's not just apes. We are not so coordinated. There are clearly smarter larger parties playing GME to their advantage and it's going to come to ahead. Just  watch how the ticker price fights over strike prices every friday as it has for the last 3 weeks. That's not normal, and that's not just apes. That's coordinated actions by someone so big they literally control millions of shares themselves. 

Honestly there are no hard truths about GME because the market is so fucking opaque we know nothing. Sure the official reports say they covered, but that's meaningless if it can neither be confirmed by a third party nor if the shorters themselves could just lie and hide the truth at no risk. 

If you choose to believe they covered then fine, but understand that's really no better than trusting any random Joe at this point. I'm not going to take the word of a spineless organization, the sec issued a paltry 250k fine the other day to a billion dollar company. That's laughable.

I know our bodies rot, our brains cease all activity, and our memory lives on in others while our DNA lives on in the cells of our children.

But would it make sense to claim after we die we are reincarnated as cybernetic fucktoys on the planet Blargletron for the Zeetse people to abuse for sexual pleasure? Would it make sense to claim we are reincarnated as some fish somewhere in the Pacific? Maybe we head down to the underworld and face Hades and Cerberus. Or maybe we float up to mystical sky wizard land and go through the pearly gates. Or maybe Set and Ra and Anubis don't give a shit because we aren't pharaohs and had insufficient offerings in our burial chambers, and ignore our wispy shade selves in the afterlife, forever.

They all make about the same amount of sense. They all have about the same amount of rational logic behind them. They all have equal weight in the likelihood of which is most probably the truth.

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"BlackBerry: How the Patent Sale could transform BB On March 30, BlackBerry has reported Q4 and FY21 results/call AH. At first the market didn't like it and on the next trading day the stock lost 10% (panic mode, loss porn and so on). However within the next 2 trading days BB has regained all its $ in a quick reversal. I'm here to tell you why.

This is a followup to [my OP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/mhi3ev/blackberry_earningscall_were_actually_bullish/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) 

^(Quick note to the Mods: I believe my OP is about to bring new original content to the discussion and hopefully will be eligible to live its life as a post.)

**Portfolio Patent Sale (big $$$)**

Quick refresh: the stock fell because the revenue came below expectations but straightaway the company said it happened because they are currently negotiating the sale of a portion of their patents specifically related to ***mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking.*** Consequently they had to voluntarily limit the monetisation of these patents during Q4.

The points I would like to investigate are: for how much $$ this sale could go, how likely this sale is to happen, who could be the buyer and when could it be completed?

***First the money.*** CEO Chen during the call: *we will report a one-time gain of a reasonably big number, followed by a tail of up to seven years.* He also confirmed the yearly revenues for Licensing are around $250m. And that BB owns 38,000 patents. I will simply use these numbers with a DCF to estimate what that ""big number"" could be. Before I proceed I would like to emphasise that CEO also said: *we believe that the completion of the transaction will be beneficial to our shareholders* (if it happens).

Assuming a 10% discount rate and 7 years of revenue life, we have $250m current year, $227m next year, $207m (...) to $141m for the final year. For a total of **$1,339bn.** That's quite a pleasing big number but let's be careful nonetheless: we don't know the size of the portfolio being negotiated and the payment is expected to be initially a lump sum  + 7years of tail royalties. So they could tweak it a bit.

With a 15% discount rate we get **$1,196bn** and at 20% **$1,081bn.** Another way to look at it: if we consider that they would sell only 75% of that side business and we discount it at 10% we still get a number north of a billion $ (consistent with CEO comment: *it's a major portion of our portfolio*). So money wise should the sale indeed happen we are looking at an one time cash flow of $1bn to $1.3bn. Not too shabby for a $5bn market cap company with already $800m cash in its hands (yes they could have momentarily circa 40% cash to mkt cap ratio).

***Is this really happening?*** There is a high probability it would maybe 80% but it's not cleared yet. To get to this conclusion I listened twice to the conf call to try to decipher the clues. Whenever CEO was talking about the amount he sounded as if that part was near completion (*will be a big number* and *the majority of the deal will come in one-time early, but there is a tail that goes on*). Although he also stated that *the company has not yet reached a definitive binding agreement and negotiations are ongoing.*

The main hurdle might be the regulatory review of the transaction as the big boss mentioned that in the most conservative scenario: *we assume that negotiation and regulatory review continue for the first half* (of FY). A sentence that directly leads me to believe that the buyer could be a major company.

***Big money buyer:*** if there is a lengthy regulatory review it might be because the potential purchaser could be in a position to infringe antitrust laws (NB: antitrust laws were created by Congress to preserve competition among businesses and prevent any one business from dominating a single industry and building a monopoly). 

Speculations are ongoing that the buyer could be Facebook. It's honestly hard to say but that's the name with the higher odds at the moment. Just to recall BB sued FB in 2018, claiming the social media giant was using BlackBerry inventions in its messaging applications. Then they settled the dispute in January 2021 over patent royalties for terms that weren‚Äôt disclosed. You see the analogy here. By the way during the conf call this settlement was never mentioned and we still didn't see the financial repercussions in BB accountancy.

That said it could very well be someone else from North America, which leads us to the when.

***The timing of the sale*** is honestly hard to guess but again let's refer to the CEO comment that in their most conservative scenario the discussions could continue during H1. Subjectively I tend to believe that it would happen sooner rather than later because 1. they are losing money by restricting their Licensing every day that goes by and 2. it was *the* major statement in their whole conference call. You can arguably think that you would release this kind of communication when negotiations are very advanced. If I had to bet I would say it's a matter of a few weeks obviously subject to the regulatory approval.

**The Transformation**

By now unless if you've been living on Mars because that game rocket took you too far, you must know that BlackBerry is no longer an handset company. They excel at cybersecurity, they are deeply involved in the automotive industry including EV thanks to QNX and they are coming big hand in hand with Amazon to bring IVY to the world (October early release and Feb22 full product).

If and when they sell that side portfolio to a potentially big name you can expect all financial and traditional media to report the transaction and to emphasise the renewal, the rebirth of BlackBerry as an Internet of Things, Cybersecurity high-margins long-duration Tech company.

In terms of communication they have just started and they are about to splash the cash to continue on. John Chen is quite excited about it: *you will see us being more aggressive, in fact we ran an ad today Intelligent Security everywhere, an ad today. I just saw it on the New York Times and so we're just going to step-up in both people and spending and resources to go after the market and it is a huge, as you know very well, it is a huge market and no clear winner at this point.*

He later added that: *we have a reasonably large number of hires mostly in sales and marketing.*

***IVY is not priced in at all:*** there is no other way to say it. At the current BB valuation investors are totally ignoring the potential of IVY, probably because they don't understand it. Let me go straight to the point.

*BB and AWS said the new intelligent vehicle data platform, called IVY, will compress the time to build, deploy and monetize in-vehicle applications and connected services across multiple brands and models, making it easier for automakers to collaborate with a wider pool of developers to accelerate development of apps and services.*

The goal is to establish IVY as a standard platform across the auto industry, as Apple and Google have done in mobile phones through their iOS and Android platforms. This way IVY could be the equivalent of the App Store but for all mobility platforms whether EV, autonomous driving EV, air drones, rockets (SpaceX already using QNX) etc. The end uses are potentially limitless and most of the current discussed applications are under NDAs. Once they start to pop out, the picture will get clearer and clearer.

Similarly to what Apple did back in the days, BB has started an IVY Fund with $50m in it + $100K AWS credit for new startups willing to develop a product on IVY. Let's also not forget that the deal was approved by Andy Jassy in December who later got upgraded from AWS big boss to Amazon CEO. We can reasonably imagine that he values IVY as a potential disruptor and Chen sees it as a *significant growth opportunity.* Initially thought to hit the market in 2023, the early release will be available as soon as October 2021 (again the market is sleeping on this advancement).

One quick word on the cybersecurity part of the business: BB and CRWD have roughly the same yearly revenue (I will leave it to the experts to discuss how comparable they are). One company has $5bn market cap and the other $44bn.

**The Bear Case**

If the sale doesn't happen at all that's gonna look bad and hurt financially. Still according to the call, *full year licensing revenue will be in the region of $100 million* (if the sale fail) vs an usual $250m per year. As mentioned throughout that's because they are limiting the Licensing revenue while negotiating. Cybersecurity growth, QNX and IVY will still remain in play but more as mid and long term catalysts. They would still push for sales and marketing but the blue sky scenario obviously implies the receipt of a billion $ in cash in exchange of their accessory patents.

*Definitely not a recommendation to buy, hold, sell any security. Besides I have no knowledge in IoT, programming, software etc. I can only read.*

*Disclosure: long BB shares and June 20C and 15C (in that order).*

**TLDR:** BB is selling their old business patents probably for more than $1bn to a big player in order to focus on their new business model - cybersecurity, IoT, QNX, IVY - and come back like what's up."
2021-04-06 20:13:21,wallstreetbets,"Rival, I think the $100M annual revenue is a dead go away to the size of the deal.  

Licensing revenue wasn‚Äôt zero this quarter.  
Far from it.  It was merely down.

Chen said we could assume that the deal will be replaced by $100M in annual revenue.

As a result, using a discount rate of 10%, HRs saying that the all in deal is worth around $1B.

If day half is up front and half is along the 7 year tail, it could be something like $650M up front and upto $100M annually for 7 years thereafter.  (Ballpark, discounted over 7 yrs)

This is still an amazing chunk of change, obviously, and will help them fuel marketing and IVY initiatives which are the REAL investment here.  

Also, as with any parent portfolio, most patents are trash / worthless.  Max 10% have any value and 10-50 (in messaging, networking, etc) that are super valuable in that they are worth defending through litigious processes.  

All in all, GREAT post, rival.  
$BB will a late 2021 story as it‚Äôs core businesses (cybersecurity / IVY develop), but this patent sale will be the one large catalyst between now and then.  

What will be interesting is if FB or the suitor tried to take a stake in the IVY deal.  As in, AMZN, B.B., FB 50/40/10.  Could happen."

2021-04-06 20:06:01,wallstreetbets,"Great DD. Required reading for those looking seriously at the stock!

I agree it is highly likely its Facebook that is buying the patents. If there is no big bump in patent revenue this quarter from the so called settlement, and Chen has basically said there won't be, then the settlement is the sale in my opinion.

I think this is being held up by the Canadian Gov't for national security reasons as has happened in the past.I am 90% certain the deal is done and the only thing that will change its value would be the Gov't insisted some patents were removed from the sale."

Great DD !!

On **IVY** \- absolutely, as you point out, barely anyone is paying serious attention in particular discounting into the valuation. It's pretty obvious IVY will work and more question of what degree. John Wall spoke at CITI and JPM Conferences in January and on April 1st on a conference call entitled *'How U.S. and Chineses corporations collaborate in growing autonomous vehicles*'. Here are some choice quotes (or paraphrases) he made during these:

* *'The response from automanufacturers has been ""overwhelming""'.*
* *'These are sitting on a ""goldmine of data"" '.*
* *""We are seeing that the use cases are unending"".*
* *""Your imagination is the limit"".*

John Wall is not a spinmaster and seems low key. He also underlined there's been lots of dialogue / exchanges with these (so he's not dreaming). 

On **Valuation** \- Yes there are quite a few known names that are used as comparables and many are valued at 10x BB even though they have similar or less revenue. The most often cited is solid but not ten times as solid and longer term not nearly as interesting, nor with potential of BB. Here is one interesting metric we can thank Bill Gates for. Almost to the day 10 years ago FB had a user base of 50 million and NO revenues. The average FB user, it seems, spends about 35 minutes per day on FB. For a 1.6% stake Bill Gates's MS invested $240 million into FB valuing FB at $15 billion (3 times the value of BB today). This also valued FB at $300 per user. QNX has a user base of over 175 million and growing at about 25 million per year. The average driver is in their car 90 mintes per day. If we ignored all of BB's current business or their potential, and looked only at IVY, BB is valued at close to $25 per user. John Wall previously calrified that IVY will work on the existing installed base of QNX. So much potential yet one does not pay for it at these levels. In fact one basically pays 1/10th some other names. Crazy but won't last.

Thanks again for the excellent DD."

As to **QNX** and **IVY** and Volvo announcement this AM -

The key that some seem to overlook. BB has stated that revenue from QNX is in range of '*high single digits to low double*' (pressumably $8-$12 range). And it's a one time. To focus on that is missing the point. It is ALL about the installed base.

The insatlled base is 175 million plus (considering it's been growing at approximately 25 million annually and we have not had an updated number in about a year, it is likely safe to assume the installed base is in the vicinity of 200 million).

Note the language in the press release and this excerpt -

""*Volvo Group wanted to take a new approach to software. It wanted to find a single supplier for the operating system (OS) and hypervisor to meet the needs of the ‚Äòwhole truck‚Äô, capable of supporting safety certification to the highest levels.*

*Following an in-depth proof of concept, Volvo Group decided to build its ‚ÄòVolvo Dynamic Software Platform‚Äô (VDSP) on the* [*QNX¬Æ OS for Safety*](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-os-for-safety) *and the* [*QNX¬Æ Hypervisor for Safety*](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-os-for-safety)*, both* [*certified to ISO 26262:2018 ASIL D*](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications)*.*

*The engagement includes a new flexible use of the QNX OS and Hypervisor for the whole vehicle, which gives developers and architects the freedom to design the best possible system as the company looks at the requirements of the next 15 years, including the future support of autonomous driving and electrification.""*

This is very much the language Blackberry uses when discussing IVY and its appeal to OEMs and automanufacturers.

It is unlikely that a less than serious conversation has already taken place with Scania and Volvo and many others about IVY, it's appeal, and use benifits (keep in mind John Wall stated the ""*use cases are unending*"" and the response has been ""*overwhelming*"").

Once one gets their heads around an installed base and recurring fees from that base, only then can one appreciate the kind of upside that awaits. Too many are just not seeing it. As you state ""IVY is not priced in at all"". In fact you get all this and a whole other package of business at a massive discount to other known names.

Here is another metric that applies to installed bases.

**NFLX** has an installed base of 200 million users worlwide (sort of the same as BB). Of course the business is different but the revenue model maybe not so different to IVY. The average NFLX user coughs over $150 US per annum. Could IVY extract $150 US per annum from its installed base ? How about $100 US or even $5O US ? I would suggest any of these numbers is more than realistic, in particular if we consider what consumers pay for cell phone service, or ISP, or cable TV, etc. The point is there will be some number and any number will be significant to IVY.

Anyone can disagree but this is precisely what BB and AWS have in mind (even ultra conservative Chen mentioned '*recurring revenue*s').

NFLX has a market cap of $250 billion or 50X BB's $5 billion. And this ignores anything else BB is doing.

Paying 10% of what the comps trade at for this kind of upside is crazy rare but I guess many just don't see it yet (including most analysts who continue to miss the boat with their cautious sitting on the fence outlooks).

Is it  possible that Watsa (with $1 billion on the line and an average share price cost of about $14 USD), or Chen (who is already very wealthy and came out of retirement and allocated so far 7 years of his life to this), or the people at AWS (who have already been involved with IVY for two years) don't have this in mind and haven't been executing in that direction ?

Exponential upside is putting it mildly."

Also, not 95% profit.

However.

>Anything open source is problematic security wise. So much time and investment to work around that problem.

I have to disagree here, it would take one large company sponsoring a few relevant projects, they would be able to cover the cost of code reviews on their available options and pick the best to bring up to commercial quality, all with public eyes on the work.

Then you bolt the bits and pieces together with some proprietary code and you're well on your way to rushing prematurely to market, such is The Way with tech.

In fact partner with a second company experienced in this study of thing, like FEDora Linux and you could do it really quickly and gain public good will too.

Most companies would fuck it up but closed source only gets a security benefit in the press not in real life. We're already popping luxury cars using nothing but digital tech because nobody (usually) but the IP owners and the so-called bad guys have the time or motive to go digging for flaws.

I would never fully trust an off the shelf closed source security system for example, to protect my house and to not already be backdoored for use by, say, feds with a warrant, which might as well be your local beat cops now with the interdepartmental ""knowledge sharing workshops"" they do. Or whatever. It's just an example.

Auto.. is perhaps different and the media ""open source bad"" messaging will probably have good traction in this field. So while I think OPs predictions are sound, don't underestimate the dark horse you haven't even heard of yet."

2021-04-07 00:12:33,wallstreetbets,"SaaS is known for not breaking even until 12-18-24months. 

Its why customer success is a giant industry now. Started with Salesforce leaky bucket problem. They were losing 8% of customers a month. Even after their IPO and shit was supposedly going to the moon, they were filling the bucket slightly faster than it was leaving, but what happens when you run out of new customers to fill the bucket with? 

So how do we keep current customers.... enter customer success. 

Historically Software/hardware sales had long deployments, you could charge for anything. For SaaS its basically the subscription is 68% of revenue (real number, https://media1-production.mightynetworks.com/asset/4189896/WHITEPAPER_Origins_of_Customer_Success.pdf page 4). 

So now you're more focused on keeping the customer. 

Also I think OP isn't considering CAq. Cost of Customer Acquisition. Shit is high as fuck in SaaS especially for smaller companies. The sales reps are paid tons, and then you need to pay engineers, sales engineers, PM, Marketing, CEO, VPs, etc. etc. etc. before you;ve even gotten the customer. 

Super costly.

2021-04-06 22:51:36,wallstreetbets,"I know a company that was 8 million in the hole cause their office manager wasn't charging their biggest buyer properly.  Somehow they also didn't notice that their entire front office staff was selling under the table and pocketing the cash.

And their delivery driver was stealing upwards of 5k of product a month....

The only reason they finally caught it is cause their manager ended up in the hospital and the new hire who covered the office was an out of work accountant noticed a 20k a month deficit in the paperwork.

Its insane what people are blind to.

Cause I also know a grocery chain that discovered they had paid for a new furnace (Twice!) for their deli manager of 20 years. Like, he submitted invoices for his house repair work and it was paid for by his company."

2021-04-06 23:30:10,wallstreetbets,"I think it was a few hundred cattle at a time over the course of several years. Also, they‚Äôre 1,000 LB cows, not $1000 cows."
2021-04-06 23:00:34,wallstreetbets,"Theres a lot of graft out there.  Grocery/Foodservice delivery systems have a lot of problems with this because so many of those trucks you see rolling around easily carry anywhere between 80-300k in product and sometimes the companies let drivers carry cash as part of the payment/pickup cycle due to smaller customers categorized as local markets.  Thus, smaller customers are not gonna set up on ACH in SAP so its usually cash on delivery."

Geez and they are a newer company but look at those GM ties, they basically are a little GM EV baby moved right into a former GM plant, seat on the board, invested cash, integrated into the supply chain.   


I mean even if early hiccups with sales and production, they aren‚Äôt gonna fail unless GM gives up on them, and they are committed to building up their EV. So they look less polished and ready than XL but with a strong tie to a big player in auto. Definitely will be watching and possibly adding, thanks for the info."

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NVAX - I liked it at $300 I LOVE it at $180 Please read these two previous posts before you shit on my positions

[1st Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq3ksw/nvax_dont_miss_this_perfect_vaccine_play_headed/)

[2nd Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/luuige/nvax_part_ii_last_call_before_a_shit_ton_of/)

First of all I want to say fucking GUH to my fellow NVAX brethren that have been riding this tendie rollercoaster with me. This is not for the faint of heart but I'm still positive on the outlook of this stock. Here are the negative events that have sent the stock down and my rebuttals to them:

**1) US approval of JnJ vaccine and additional orders of MRNA and PFE** \- The US at this point is pretty loaded with vaccine doses, we have enough as it is without NVAX to vaccinate all the US. This leads to the common misconception that NVAX is too late to the party and has missed out. However, the US is still going to purchase 110 million doses from NVAX no matter what once it is approved. The deal is already made. The US gov funded NVAX to get these doses they will not just refuse to buy them. Despite this I still insist the US market share DOES NOT MATTER. Here are a list of other deals NVAX has lined up

* [SHIT TONS](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-covid-19-vaccine-manufacturing-agreement-serum) of manufacturing deals leading to production of 2+ BILLION doses every year across the world
* [1.1 BILLION dose deal](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-memorandum-understanding-gavi-cumulative) with COVAX the majority of which will be vaccines from NVAX
* [40 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-expanded-collaboration-and-license-agreement) to South Korea
* [6 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-government-switzerland-announce-agreement-principle) to the Swiss
* [76 Million Doses + Manufacturing Deal](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-memorandum-understanding-produce-covid-19) to our Poutine eating brethren
* [51 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-finalizes-agreement-commonwealth-australia-51-million) to Australians
* [10.7 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-agreement-government-new-zealand-107-million) to the Kiwis
* [60 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-uk-government-announce-collaboration-and-purchase) to the British

**2) EU deal talks with NVAX fall apart citing manufacturing concerns -** OK this one sounds bad I admit. Could it be? NVAX can't actually secure enough of its raw materials to make vaccines for the EU? If they can't even do that how are we supposed to expect them to be able to make vaccines for the rest of the world? The truth is that NVAX was the one that refused to sign the deal with the EU. As demonstrated in [this article](https://www.thepavlovictoday.com/andrew-bridgen-mp-the-eu-and-ursula-von-der-leyen-set-out-to-teach-astrazeneca-a-lesson-but-only-shown-that-they-need-to-learn-one-themselves/) the EU has been an incredibly litigious vaccine customer and has made AZ's life hell. Hence why the EU has been [doing poorly](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/06/eu-blames-astrazeneca-failure-for-sluggish-covid-vaccine-rollout) as far as vaccine rollout goes. Basically, NVAX has more than enough customers that are less troublesome than the EU willing to buy their product and NVAX only has so many doses readily available, why sell to the EU when you can sell to others?

&#x200B;

**3) Insider selling** \- If you sell your positions when you see a headline about an insider selling stock you should really reconsider this investing hobby thing and go into buying beanie babies or whatever the fuck you feel more comfortable with because you'll never make money or be able to hug your kids with such fragile paper hands. Execs sell their stock all the time, they schedule selling months ahead of time or just want the money. In fact, NVAX execs were selling their stock at $125 just days before Phase 3 data came out that sent NVAX to $300+. It simply has not been indicative of catastrophic news. 

**4) General market pullback** \- As many of you are aware the market has been extremely rocky in March and NVAX is not immune to this. In fact, being such a high beta stock it is more vulnerable. Biotech has been absolutely slammed by the market in March which makes this a PERFECT buying opportunity.

&#x200B;

Now onto the good stuff - two catalysts I expect this month:

**1) UK Approval -** NVAX has completed its UK Phase 3 trial and the results look GREAT. At 96% efficacy it's the best performing vaccine reported to date. It already had submitted data to the UK as part of a rolling review and should get the approval by the [end of April](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-could-be-approved-by-uk-in-april-evening-standard-says-2021-03-30). I cannot stress this enough, I do **not** think approval has been priced in. This would be the very first approval that NVAX has ever received and will finally validate it as a profitable company with a future. Canada, Australia, and NZ would very shortly follow in approvals if this passes in the UK.

**2) US Phase 3 Results -** This will likely take investors by surprise! NVAX enrolled their phase 3 trial in record time which allowed them to get started much earlier than anticipated. Additionally, with 30,000 participants this trial is much larger than the UK trial and they will likely reach their endpoint targets in much less time than what the UK trial took. In fact, this US phase 3 trial [started crossover studies](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/novavax-to-expand-covid-19-vaccine-trials-to-children-teens-2021-04-05) which potentially indicates the interim endpoints have already been reached AND they are now expanding the trial to include children and teens. We were hoping for a long time that the FDA would use the UK phase 3 data but now we might not even have to wait for that.

&#x200B;

Other positive news/useful info:

**1) This stock has gone through tremendous de-risking.** At $180 a share NVAX is almost down to the price it was before Phase 3 data came out. It can't fall much more, and at a market cap of 12.9 Bn it is grossly undervalued.

**2) Other covid developements -** a) NVAX announced in their earnings call that SA variant trials would begin by the start of the summer and that these would be solely safety-based. If the original vaccine is approved for efficacy these would not have to demonstrate such rigorous efficacy data. b) NanoFlu+Covid or NanoFlu+Covid+RSV vaccine trials are supposed to start by the end of the year.

Positions:

$200c 5/21

$200c 7/16

Price target = $400"
2021-04-06 23:56:16,wallstreetbets,"I've been holding long over a year. Bought a house and still holding. Novavax is derisked except for politics. And, the results are clearly best in class.

2021-04-06 23:54:02,wallstreetbets,I'm just trying starting to try and get my first option trade brain wrinkles so I'm just studying and paper trading options right now but I think these are the highest premiums I have ever seen when it comes to buying options.

2021-04-07 10:13:05,wallstreetbets,Long since Nov 2019. $400 is a good start.
2021-04-07 10:27:51,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve been wrecked trying to buy this Dip. Do you think the pop to $330 was mainly short driven? 

I am starting to think the weakness on price is from the longitudinal studies of Pfizer and Moderna coming out and showing efficacy at 6months. Basically if vaccines are that effective the overall market shrinks. 

Also keep in mind moderna valuation is based on their anti cancer pipeline. So I‚Äôm not sure we can expect much more than 20B market cap for NVAX. Maybe somewhere near $250-$300 range given market size/share uncertainty"
2021-04-07 19:58:49,wallstreetbets,Ok. I'm holding 200 long at $176. Thinking about buying some calls if it stays down (already burned $3k in NVAX calls last month). What kind of call/timing are you liking? üöÄüöÄ

The rest I'm splitting between diversifying my portfolio and taking care of some real life needs.  So if I hit 100K, i'll put 40k aside in my savings account, spend 30k on various stock and investments, and 30k to blow on shit i need.  I have no clue if that 40k is sufficient, but it should be in the ballpark.  And if there's any leftover, I can still use that money for something next year."
2021-04-07 01:32:39,wallstreetbets,"That's absolutely Reaganomics... But also what I plan on doing because unless shares are going for 50k a pop, it's not worth withdrawing to pay things like student loan debt.

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A Bet on Canadian Cannabis: The Final Bet TLDR: APHA 4/16 $21C

After blessing you all with the Trilogy ([Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hvfhwg/a_bet_on_canadian_cannabis/), [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j5aqp4/a_bet_on_canadian_cannabis_part_2/), [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kltsat/a_bet_on_canadian_cannabis_part_3/)), it is unfortunately time for our last earnings bet on Aphria. Before jumping down to the comment section to give me your smooth brain opinion on cannabis stocks, please take a second to go fuck yourself. 

Those of you who like to make money take a few minutes to read this DD, as it really doesn‚Äôt get easier than this. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mlcyb6/13k_earnings_yolo_on_apha/) is my position. 

Before I even get into the analysis I wanted to take a second to point out the [article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/aphria-revenue-estimates-lowered-by-stifel-ahead-of-q3-earnings-on-weak-cannabis-consumption-trends-2021-04-06?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo) released today by Stifel. They are lowering earnings expectations due to weak cannabis consumption trends, the share price has dropped 4% today likely because of this article. Stifel expects $163M revenue this Q, and has given us a laughably easy expectation to beat, while also giving us a better entry point. 

**Why Stifel is a Joke, My DD**

Last Q revenues were $160M, they need an additional $3M to beat Stifel expectations

Because I think Stifel has the smoothest brain out of anyone reading this, and I hope they are, I‚Äôll start with Cannabis Revenues.

Last Quarter Highlights:

Canada Rec Sales: Sept: $257M, Oct: $270M, Nov: $261M

Total Canada Sales: $788M

Aphria Net Cannabis Revs were $67M last Q

Now according to Stifel there have been weak cannabis consumptions trends, and I‚Äôm not entirely sure where they‚Äôre getting this info from. I get mine from the Government of Canada who releases [National Sales](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=2010000801&pickMembers%5b0%5d=2.30&pickMembers%5b1%5d=3.1) on a monthly basis, so lets take a look. 

[Dec-Feb this Q  ](https://preview.redd.it/32u2iutsflr61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18deaec8e2154510b5f27264467bf3771158e95c)

Canada Rec Sales: Dec: $290M, Jan $282M, Feb N/A

As far as the first 2 months of the quarter go, cannabis consumption has increased 8.5% QoQ, while Stifel is claiming the opposite, in fact December and January are the 2 highest sales months since cannabis was legalized. Aphria has been the #1 LP in Canada for the last 2 quarters and I expect them to continue to hold their current market share as most of the Canadian growth comes from Ontario, where Aphria holds the largest market share. 

Not only are cannabis sales NOT declining in Canada as Stifel suggests, they seemingly forgot that Aphria is adding another existing business to their books this Quarter. Aphria acquired SweetWater Brewing in November, with the deal closing on November 25. We get a glimpse of SweetWater revenues on the last report as it ended Nov 30, recording $881k of revenues in the 6 days the company was on the books. Based on the above we can expect new revenues north of $10M added to the top line from the SweetWater acquisition. That $10M+ in new revenue plus their growing Cannabis Sales should be more than enough to cover Stifel's expectations. 

I‚Äôll leave the speculation on what Stifel is trying to do up to you guys, but I do thank them for the better entry. I should also point out that Aphria/Tilray merger vote is on April 14, 2 days after earnings.

I like the stock."

2021-04-07 14:49:14,wallstreetbets,"My APHA story:

Time in the market will always be better than timing it. I held onto APHA through the short report, bad press, not so great financials for years and pressure to sell. At the time I bought at the peak in 2017. 

Saw my shares go down to $2 and didn‚Äôt know what to do with myself. Family pressure and friends pressuring to sell. Saying that saving is the way and that I was being irresponsible. So I doubled down on every drop I could. 

By November my average share price was now 6.45 instead of 17 or 18 (can‚Äôt remember exactly). Elections roll around (exactly why I was BUYING MORE) and then we saw the results. 3 long years of me constantly looking at losses and feeling like complete shit because I had told people about my investments and of course people will always remind you of your mistakes every time they can (don‚Äôt do what I did be quiet). 

February rolls around and those same friends didn‚Äôt even ask. They knew. They knew I was right then and they know I am right today. There is no better feeling in the world and your day will come young grasshopper. You need to buy more. That‚Äôs it. Is it shares? Not options? Buy more. Is this industry going anywhere else but up? No. I‚Äôm still holding those shares and didn‚Äôt sell at the ‚Äútop‚Äù because that was t the top period. 

I am holding indefinitely because that‚Äôs how you build wealth. Not by hoping In and out of trades because somewhere along the way you‚Äôre gonna probably make a mistake. Few day traders are able to come up with (at peak) +300% return. The likelihood of you being able to do that? Not so likely. 

Hold your shares. Buy more. Period.

2021-04-06 20:36:52,wallstreetbets,Basically the biggest cannabis stock by revenue on the making.

2021-04-06 20:40:23,wallstreetbets,"maybe I'm just smooth brained but wouldn't merger arbitrage in this situation work out in your favor if you were holding APHA? APHA 17.29 currently, TLRY 21.14. If you're receiving 0.87 TLRY for every APHA, that would value every APHA share at 18.39. So at current price APHA is trading at a discount. Obviously this price discrepancy is accounting for possibility of the merger vote failing but looking at 1.10 in intrinsic value   at current price.

EDIT: looked up additional information and found that share conversion is actually 0.8381. Merger arbitrage scenario still exists, just not as lucrative as my previous calculation."

2021-04-06 20:18:25,wallstreetbets,What's your point? When that happens CURLF will be able to export to Europe the same as Tilray using all of its acreage.
2021-04-06 20:25:10,wallstreetbets,"My point again is that CURLF already holds the top spot in the US, and has positioned itself to take part of Europe when that eventually goes through. Tilray holds the top spot in Canada , a country that has about a tenth of the population of the US and will probably take some of the European market when that goes through. Tilray might enter the US and CURLF might enter Canada but given the hold each have on their territories,  neither will be as successful as the other in the markets they attempt to break into. That leaves me wanting to invest in American Cannabis not Canadian."

2021-04-06 21:47:26,wallstreetbets,"5/21 so you have time to be right. The price will go up and down between now and expiration. More time to expiration means more chances for it to go up and more time to sell when it‚Äôs up. I‚Äôd go further out for your first call but that‚Äôs more expensive. 

Also APHA is merging with TLRY on or around 4/20. The price might spike before that, or after, or it might tank immediately after and then maybe go up. 4/16 means you miss the merger. 4/21 means you‚Äôre fucked if the stock tanks immediately after. 5/21 gives you time to profit off whatever happens. 

$17 because there‚Äôs pretty strong support at $17. Look at the past 3 months on a chart. Sometimes it dips below $17 but it usually bounces off and back up. It‚Äôs a safe strike without going too deep ITM (more expensive).

It‚Äôs always better to buy more ITM and further out expirations if you like making money. It gives you more leeway to be right. ITM is an upfront cost that you get back if you sell for a profit. Further out is a sunk cost that increases your probability of making money, but you can still recover some of that cost the sooner you sell."

2021-04-06 21:04:25,wallstreetbets,Tried to read that but it grammatically makes no sense. I'm not sure what you are trying to say. If you are saying it will be easy for a foreign company to come into the US market when things loosen up I think you are wrong given the hold companies that already operate here have. If you are saying it will be hard for the US to enter other markets maybe but Tilray is in Canada so they are in the same boat. Or if you are saying something else? Idk that was hard to make sense of my man. Either way good luck investing! Hope you find a winning strategy.

2021-04-06 23:32:21,wallstreetbets,What OP did and how he made so much? I'm new to the stock market.
2021-04-07 01:15:37,wallstreetbets,"This will be nice for me as well because I have been trying to find ways I can describe or explain what options are to beginners without using technical terms that kind of make it more confusing than it needs to. 

What OP did was what‚Äôs called an option play. 

In a regular stock, you make money by buying a stock at a certain price and waiting some time for that price to rise so you can sell it for a profit. But the problem with this is that you may not have enough money, so if you only put $100 and get a 2% rise, you gain two dollars for a total of $102. 

So in the most layman term, (and this is NOT technical explanation of what OP did but rather helpful comparison). 

You see that +25? Add 2 zeros to that. Now, it looks like OP bought 2,500 shares of GM at $40.6 per share (number at ‚Äúbreak even price‚Äù). 

Currently GM is trading at 62$. This means he gained 62-40.6= 21.4$ per share. Remember there are 2500 shares, so $21.4 times 2,500 is 53,500 profit. 

So he made around 55k. And he only put in 1,500$ for this because that‚Äôs the price he bought (avg cost). 

Again, he did not actually buy shares, he bought what‚Äôs called a contract. And you can essentially think of a contract as ‚Äúbuying‚Äù 100 shares that get activated when you go past the break even price. This way you can on things like 2500 shares of GM with dust 1,500 dollars when buying the shares would have costed you 100,000$ at 40$ a share. 

(*Again this is not a technical description or even exclamation of what OP did or what an option is. This is just trying to make sense of how he made the money for the beginners who don‚Äôt really understand why leveraging works or what leveraging even means*)"

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"MY EXPERIENCE WITH SWEET CREAM BUTTER FUTURES: Hello children gather around the campfire ~

It all started last year in February of 2020 right when the pandemic was really starting to batter the U.S. 

I was playing some 5/5/15 PLO at my buddies game, when my friend who we all just call ‚Äúmilk man‚Äù began to open his stupid mouth about how ‚Äúthis and that‚Äù is going to send the price of sweet cream butter skyrocketing because of some bullshit about how grocery stores will be understocked and Martha will need a fuck ton of sweet cream butter to feed the family while everyone‚Äôs stuck at home. We all call him milk man because he‚Äôs literally a cow milker, has a big farm, and always wears this hat with a cow on it. 

I use derogatory language when regarding milk man now, but then, his stack was tall and mine was short. I was tilted and also drunk when something in me clicked and said ‚Äúthis is it. butter futures is the yolo that will make me rich.‚Äù I was working a great job in finance at the time and had some capital to work with.

I listened to milk man go on and on about butter for the rest of the night. The next morning, Monday. I yolo‚Äôd into CME cash-settled butter futures expiring March 15th, 2020. Naive me at the time thought COVID would be over with within a couple of months.

Then it all went to fucking shit. 

So supposedly I didn‚Äôt yolo into sweet cream butter futures but I just flat out yolod into butter futures. I honestly didn‚Äôt even know what the fuck I was doing but I just figured all butter was going up crazy so it didn‚Äôt matter. Well I was dead wrong. 

These fucking worthless dairy farmers couldn‚Äôt keep up with the demand so they began to either put palm oil into the butter or the fed the cows too much palm oil to the point that it got into the butter. I‚Äôm still not sure what they did, but it doesn‚Äôt matter. Half of god damn Canada was complaining that their butter is rock solid at room temperature. How the fuck do you expect them to spread it on toast? It was a disaster. Butter tanked. I was ruined. 

Fast forward a year later and looking back it‚Äôs all not so bad. I have a really steady job now and the pay is pretty good. The only downside is every time I‚Äôm milking cows on milk mans farm he says the same dumb joke every time. 

‚ÄúMake sure that‚Äôs sweet cream milk and not regular milk!‚Äù

2021-04-07 16:07:41,wallstreetbets,"Those calls were probably sold covered, so his exercising them should have zero effect on the ticker price though, right?  Usually he posts his yolo updates after the market closes so it wouldn't even necessarily deliver a hype/sentiment boost that affects the ticker.  


I think people are hoping for RC announcement as CEO and/or some kind of share recall/split/???? that would force the hedges to begin covering.  Clearly Gamestop and RC think there's room for this thing to grow else they'd do the share sale now."
2021-04-06 21:25:49,wallstreetbets,Complicated question. The calls he holds have extrinsic value that is rapidly decreasing due to theta decay. He can still capitalize on the remaining extrinsic value by selling his options now vs exercising them at expiration.
2021-04-06 22:13:42,wallstreetbets,"Despite some people down voting you're right in that an option position can be ""rolled out"" to another expiration.   There is additional premium for this,  but your question is reasonable."
2021-04-06 22:54:24,wallstreetbets,They most likely bought all the shares to fill the call once it hit 12.01. Those calls would've been covered very long ago
2021-04-07 06:30:49,wallstreetbets,Or they weren‚Äôt naked calls?
2021-04-06 20:34:42,wallstreetbets,Yea when I'm having a bad day. I kick myself for not buying those calls myself. I guess I'm a glutton for punishment as they say lol
2021-04-07 11:17:56,wallstreetbets,"I said i READ that options delay the squeeze, the short squeeze. Options does nothing to help with the squeeze, buying and holding shares does though.

You can use it to see who‚Äôs a fellow member of WSB and who‚Äôs actually making money. [Here‚Äôs](https://www.reddit.com/r/investmentdata/comments/kj69oo/track_trading_by_us_senators/) the dashboard tracking trading by U.S. Senators.

[Senate Stock trading vs. S&P 500](https://preview.redd.it/4tqxbg3gxkr61.png?width=1960&format=png&auto=webp&s=da597db3d306e5abf848080cec1726e6bce09730)

A while back I did a little write-up on which politicians I actually think browse this sub, I‚Äôll copy that below:

**Honorable Mention: Former Rep. Barbara Comstock (VA-10)**

Comstock lost her 2018 re-election bid and I don't necessarily think she is a WSBer (she doesn't trade nearly as many meme stocks as the other guys on this list) but I do blame her for turning off the ATM that was 2016-2018 $MU.

She bought \~$75,000 worth of Micron Technology stock on 6/25/18, just days before the first stretch in years when the stock wasn't literally printing money. MU lost half its value in the next 6 months, and still hasn't recovered to the price she purchased it at.

**#5. Rep. Alan Lowenthal (CA-47)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SPCE, GLD***

Lowenthal is actually one of the more successful traders on this list, having gotten in to $GLD in September of 2019. He also timed his exit from $SPCE pretty well, selling about half of his position right at the mid-February peak.

If I had to guess, I'd say Lowenthal just lurks the sub looking for opportunities to inverse WSB.

**#4. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SNAP, TSLA, GE, NVDA, LULU, AMD***

The Josh Gottheimer story is a story of perseverance and diamond hands. I'm pretty sure this guy read some DD on here that said SNAP was going to moon after its IPO, because he bought into the stock just days after it went public. He caught the falling knife right on its tip as his position lost 75% of its value over the next couple years. A lesser man would have cut the loss, but Gottheimer just kept buying up more $SNAP even as it was losing him money. Those of you who have an eye on the markets (perhaps a minority) will know that his grit and determination was rewarded handsomely in the last couple months.

**#3. Sen. Pat Roberts (Kansas)**

***Favorite meme stocks: TSLA, GLD, BYND, NVDA, GE***

Pat Roberts is another guy that I think just comes here to inverse the sub. Roberts made an impeccably well-timed TSLA play a few months ago when he bought in on August 3rd, just a few days before the August run-up began and then sold on September 1st, just before the early September drop.

Insider trading or inversing WSB? You decide.

WSB must be big in Kansas, because the next guy up is the fellow who was just elected to fill the vacancy being left by Roberts upcoming departure from the senate.

**#2. Rep. Roger Marshall (KS-1)**

***Favorite meme stocks: JNUG, TSLA, SNAP, MU, ROKU, AMD, NVDA, LULU***

Marshall got a big promotion to the Senate a few days ago, and if that didn't work out he probably would have switched to day-trading full time. He was already day-trading JNUG within a few months of entering office, buying and then selling thousands of dollars worth of the stock between market open and close.

What Marshall really lacks is patience, as he recently entered then prematurely exited a position in ROKU in mid-September, missing out on big gains in the weeks to follow.

**#1 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (Rhode Island)**

***Favorite meme stocks: GME, TSLA, GE, NVDA***

The story of Sheldon Whitehouse is not a happy story, but it's a story that might be told of many a member of this community. He had the right ideas, but just did not have strong enough hands to see them through.

On July 28, 2017, Whitehouse entered a position in $TSLA. Seeing a modest 3% gain through the month of August, he doubled down on his position on August 24th, 2017.

Although he soon began to lose money as $TSLA sank, in Elon he still trusted, and he bought more $TSLA yet again in December of 2018.

Sadly for Whitehouse, we now reach the heartbreaking part of the story. Seeing a 30% loss on the investments into TSLA he'd been making over the last 2 years, Whitehouse lost faith and sold the entirety of the position on August 27th, 2019.

After holding TSLA for over 2 years at a loss, he sold within weeks of what would become a yearlong, nearly 1000% run-up."

2. Bottom of the barrel orthodontists.  Self explanatory, only people working here can't maintain their own practice; Or overseas ones, either way, no shifts given.  Considering how terrible in person orthodontists are already, imagine how bad they are.  

3. Lies/incompetence.  Basically kept saying they could fix my problem. 3 rounds and no solution.  End up with teeth messed up in a different way than at the start.  Waste of years that could have been used to actually fix my teeth.  

Positives

No upcharge for extra rounds (I paid upfront though) even after repeated failures.  More likely didn't track previous cycles.

Everyone was kind and honestly wanted to help; only reason i stuck around.  

90% refund, probably could have gotten 95+% based on how fast they agreed, as it's cheap price to not get sued for messing up.  

Overall, they are only good the simplest of issues and the cost savings is from being shit outta luck if it doesn't work.  With the constantly dropping costs of the 3D printing, they are quickly losing their competitive advantage, as you can see by their rapidly rising prices.

2021-04-07 12:15:11,wallstreetbets,"Ammunition, mostly. One of the drivers for the Bull case for ASO is ammunition sales, since ammo prices have skyrocketed, but ammo is only one small part of Academy‚Äôs business‚ÄîVista, on the other hand, gets 68% of its revenue from ammunition, and recently acquired a new factory from Remington. On top of that, ammo is usually very low margin‚Äîthe increased price of ammo represents even more of a profit increase than it looks like at first blush for a manufacturer, and the rise of e-commerce through COVID plays a role in reducing their marginal cost, since they‚Äôre an ammo producer.

As far as their high P/E ratio goes, they were actually trading even higher when the stock went public in 2015, again likely due to a similar ammo shortage at the time. The fact that this was the year the stock went public frustrates analysis, but I think it‚Äôll go even higher than back then‚ÄîVista has been paying off debt for the last five years and the ammo shortage is even more extreme than it was in 2015 due to many people buying their first gun in 2020. Plus, they‚Äôre not just keeping production static‚Äîthey‚Äôre ramping up, and Biden is nothing if not a status quo warrior who will keep the ammo hoarders riled up while making no effectual change in gun laws."
2021-04-06 21:17:27,wallstreetbets,You can still get IV crushed and lose both ways.
2021-04-07 14:40:03,wallstreetbets,"Also, re: their debt, have you read through their Q4 report?

First off, they didn't pay off 50% of their debt-- not even remotely close.  Out of their $4b in liabilities they paid off 660m.  Basically none of it was paying down debt-- most of it was just them paying off suppliers who had floated them goods for the upcoming holiday season.  And almost all of that came straight out of their cash reserves.  They had 870m cash in hand now they've got 150m.

Second, have you read the 2020 term loan facility?  It's not a full on variable rate loan like the 2015 facility was, but it's very close-- they have the choice of paying either LIBOR+5 (with a minimum of 0.75 for the LIBOR) OR the *highest* of 1) Fed Funds Rate + 0.5, Credit Suisse's ""prime rate,"" or the one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus a margin of 4%.  So they're only guaranteed a fixed minimum rate if LIBOR stays under 0.75.

Third-- and this is the real kick in the pants-- they're reducing their hedge against a rise in the interest rate.  Per their Q4 report:

> We use interest rate swap agreements to hedge market risk relating to possible adverse changes in interest rates.
All interest rate swaps had been designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate interest payments on borrowings under the 2015 Term Loan Facility. On October 28, 2020, we determined that a portion of the underlying cash flows related to $100.0 million of swap notional principal amount was no longer probable of occurring over the remaining term of the interest rate swaps as a result of the Company's planned refinancing transactions (see Note 15). As a result, we reclassified approximately $1.3 million of losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss (""AOCI"") to other (income) expense, net in our statements of income for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2020 related to the portion of the forecasted transaction no longer considered probable of occurring. We also de-designated a portion of our interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges, leaving $250 million notional principal amount designated and $650 million undesignated. The remaining $4.0 million loss in AOCI as of October 31, 2020 related to the de-designated hedges will be amortized as an increase to interest expense over the original maturity of the de-designated swaps. The de-designated $650 million notional principal amount of fixed interest rate swaps will receive mark-to-market treatment prospectively, with changes in fair value recorded immediately to other (income) expense, net on the statements of income.

You see what they're saying?  ""We had a hedge against rate increases with a notional value of $1b, but we decided we didn't need it any more.  We're keeping $250m of that as a hedge, but we've freed up the other $750m, and this quarter we sold $100m of that $750m.  Any money we make or lose with these undesignated swaps we're going to call income.""

But the 2020 loan facility offers an alternative fixed minimum rate only if LIBOR stays below 0.75.  If it goes above 0.75 then the rates become just as variable as the 2015 loan facility.  It's like if they had 100 lifeboats on their ship and they've just sold 10 of them and put another 65 up for sale.  But as soon as LIBOR goes above 0.75, the seas will become just as choppy as when they had 100 lifeboats.

A LIBOR over 0.75 isn't a crazy thought, you roll the clock back just 1 year and LIBOR was over 0.75.  This is a risky strategy for a company that's reporting $4.3b of assets against $3.3b of liabilities, especially when $862m of their assets is goodwill and another $1.72b is other intangibles.

EDIT:  Fixed some grammar."

Not to mention half of that debt is from the new senior secured notes which bear interest at a fixed rate and the other half is the term loan.

Their liabilities haven't changed, they're in just as much debt as they were last year and the year before that.  The only difference is their accounts payable has gotten all kinds of fucked up.  It's double what it was last year!  The suppliers might not charge you interest, but it's the same thing when they demand a higher price for the goods in exchange for delayed payment, or worse, tell you to fuck off and give priority to your competitors.  When the pandemic ends, those accounts payable numbers are going to return to the historic trendline or you're gonna operate at a higher cost than your competitors or the suppliers will just stop supplying you.  Are you seriously trying to argue that this is normal and healthy and can be sustained?  Their COGS didn't double my dude, don't fucking pretend this is normal shit.

And the new debt structure does not have a lower interest expense, what are you talking about?  They're paying 6% on their fixed stuff (which is higher than the 2015 stuff it's replacing) and the variable rates on their 2020 stuff are higher than their 2015 stuff.

They haven't reduced their liabilities.  They've failed to renew about half of their long-term debt, and on the other half they're paying higher rates.

Seriously, look at the asset/liabilities of Big Five's or Dick's, or Hibbett, or any of these other guys, and then look at ASO's balance sheet.  It's a fucking jump scare looking at this shit."
2021-04-07 19:24:01,wallstreetbets,"To respond to the rest of your comment...

Cash increased $228, AP increased $363 (most of the increase in current liabilities), and COGS increased $556. We can assume that the cash will need to be used to satisfy their current liabilities (likely AP). 

If we do that, total AP drops $563 for FYE 2021 compared to $429 for FYE 2020 and $530 for FYE 2019. 

Using these numbers, we can calculate days payable outstanding. That gives us 46 days for FYE 2021 and 52 days for FYE 2020. So they actually paid their suppliers faster this year than they did last year.

As for interest expense on the new debt structure, it‚Äôs lower. Paying 6% on $800 million is cheaper than paying 5% on $1.4 billion."

And accrued expenses and other liabilities went up 80, and they've got 138 in deferred taxes they need to pay.

> We can assume that the cash will need to be used to satisfy their current liabilities (likely AP).

Ok, so they're gonna take the extra cash, and instead of replenishing their inventory, or paying their taxes, they're gonna pay their suppliers.  A bold strategy Cotton, let's see where we go with this.

> If we do that, total AP drops $563 for FYE 2021 compared to $429 for FYE 2020 and $530 for FYE 2019.

And all you had to do was leave some of your shelves empty and kidnap the guy the IRS sent after you, I'm liking it.

> Using these numbers, we can calculate days payable outstanding. That gives us 46 days for FYE 2021 and 52 days for FYE 2020. So they actually paid their suppliers faster this year than they did last year.

Maybe the suppliers will be so happy they'll help us bury the body of that IRS agent we had to disappear.

2021-04-07 01:55:05,wallstreetbets,"Good question. Yes, DISCB ownership was squeezier because the ownership was like 95% held with one dude. VIACA is not quite that concentrated, but it is still extremely tight. Insiders own about 80%, and very large institutions that want some sway in voting own about 15%, and the rest is floated or short. Arbitrageurs tend to short the shares when they trade ahead of their sister share (VIACA and VIAC), which can make these floats even tighter. So I think the best way to play a rebound trade and potentially get some of that DISCB style action is to play VIACA. I have a feeling it will catch shorts offsides once the selling is done.

I should probably do one more post about this aspect. It seems not as many people as I expected are appreciating this angle of the trade. I wanted to post a bunch of pictures illustrating this point in my original post, but I can't figure out how to do that."
2021-04-07 10:58:37,wallstreetbets,Well at least that makes one of us. Good luck.

2021-04-06 20:35:44,wallstreetbets,"Eh, Disney's parks were servicing near-capacity pre-covid as it was, to the point that they kept raising entrance fees. With their current price being a massive increase over their pre-covid peak I don't think they're really primed for much of a move upward. Park reopenings are definitely priced in."
2021-04-06 21:51:15,wallstreetbets,Disney is an old classic in a new world. I bought a vintage Mickey Mouse watch that shows mickey pointing at the time. I like looking at my Mickey watch and thinking about my Disney shares.

groceries: about the same as mid-level grocery (cub, kroger, safeway, etc). usually cheaper staples, but meat is hit or miss.

toiletpaper/cleaning supplies/etc: cheapest you can find except costco. quality is brand names, so its fine.

baby disposables (diapers, etc): cheapest name brands around.

baby non-disposables (strollers and such): china crap. do not buy

high end luxury: do not shop at walmart.

overall walmart is great.

‚Äú Hey there Prestigious_Count_62, good afternoon, hope all is well on your end. I just wanted to ask if you have the Acorns investing app and if you might be interested in joining a pool I am running to try and reach their 4 referrals for $1000 bonus target by the end of the week.

Acorns is a stock investing app in the US that has recently started a promo where you get $1000 if you can refer 4 people by the end of the week. Its a legit app, if you look it up on the app store its got over 700,000 reviews.

You would only need to keep your account open for like a month and then you could close it. I am splitting the profit between everyone in the pool, so you get a big cut of the $1000 if you are interested :)

Let me know if you might be interested in this and I could send over some more info. I promise that this not a scam, just google this offer and you will see plenty of reputable finance blogs covering the same thing. I also have found its far more profitable to build long-term trust with people and ultimately get them to try many of my referrals, vs just trying to scam them out of a quick buck and burning potential bridges with the few folks actually interested in giving me a chance with one of my offers. I don‚Äôt even care if you use my referral codes over someone else's, wont bother me either way. Thanks, and enjoy the rest of your day!‚Äù"

It doesn't seem like that big a risk to me... Or am I just dumb?

2021-04-06 23:22:09,wallstreetbets,"```
My Strategy Summarized:
1)  I never fight the trend. If its green, i buy calls. If its red, i buy puts. I will only buy puts on a green day if there is a overall change in market trend. Inversely, calls on a red day
2) Price action is my #1 indicator. I wait for it to confirm my thesis before i enter a trade
3) I only trade SPY Options
4) My baseline is to choose a call/put that has a DTE 6-7 days out, with a strike $2-$3 away. I adjust that to fit my current appetite for volatility. i virtually never play same day DTE's. 
5) I set a 10% stop, but usually exit at 8% before my stop triggers depending on current situation
6) I utilize about 10-20% of my Portfolio for one trade. Sometimes more. Rarely less. 
7) I never hold overnight in these market conditions.
8) I shoot for 10-20% for gains. Depending on market conditions.
9) The main indicators i use are the:
       a) RSI
       b) 8ema
       c) 50 sma
       d) 200 sma
       e) macd
10) I never force a trade. No trade is a good trade too if the entry just isn't there. 
11) Patience always pays off. A great set-up can form in minutes or seconds. I never regret being patient to enter. I nearly always regret rushing into a trade.

2021-04-07 06:14:41,wallstreetbets,">When someone tries to scare you and mentions the ‚Äúunsprung weight‚Äù the motors might add on, tell them to chill because 100% they don‚Äôt even know what that means. There‚Äôs ways around it. You know how much a conventional motor adds to the vehicle ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and how cars are literally engineered around it. Same thing will go with the hub-motors. Actually, the weight distribution will be better in Hub-Motors because all four wheels will have equal weights on them. Your center of gravity will be truly center to the vehicle.

I like how you also have no idea what unsprung weight means and then mention something completely tangential about weight distribution. There are already cars with equal weight distribution."
2021-04-07 01:38:56,wallstreetbets,"Avg down is the best advise I can give you while you can.....not a financial advisor....\^..\^

2021-04-07 17:11:34,wallstreetbets,I kind of want to wait till the race before going in on this.

2021-04-07 00:17:09,wallstreetbets,"EV's are a totally screwed up market right now. They have their uses like golf carts. They have serious battery problems. We know Lithium Ion is not the future. It's an environmental nightmare that makes gas look clean. Charge times suck for any type of cross country use. Whatever infrastructure for charging that is created will be obsolete as soon as a new environmentally sound battery solution is found. 

In my opinion because I don't give investment advice. Whatever the next gen of battery is will be the investment that goes to Andromeda. These EV vehicle companies will be swallowed and may make you a few bucks but they aren't the thing that moons. The thing that powers them that can charge in a minute will be the thing that moons. Start looking into the Aluminum Ion dream."
2021-04-07 17:08:52,wallstreetbets,I mean that's the point of shorting. If you see fraud you short it and tell everyone how you see it. The shorter is assuming a lot of risk obviously.

2021-04-07 17:27:07,wallstreetbets,"I am with you. I want to see how it does in San Felipe before making a decision. A beta that rolls on the ground is one thing but a beta that can do a race is a whole another thing. Then you know if the truck doesn't tear itself apart, catches on fire, only does 100 miles or maims the driver. There's a lot of shady stuff but if the product works that's the most important thing because they could potentially get acquired too."
2021-04-07 14:58:38,wallstreetbets,What??
2021-04-07 15:07:50,wallstreetbets,THEY DON'T HAVE AN ENGINE WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE POINT OF EV IS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE AN ENGINE. I am genuinely very concerned for the people in this subreddit.
2021-04-07 15:19:08,wallstreetbets,i guess i dont know a lot about cars but i think this might depend on your definition of an engine. to me engine is somewhat interchangable with motor as something that converts power to physical energy. If you say it doesnt have a traditional engine them i agree but i just wasnt sure what you were reffering to
2021-04-07 15:29:12,wallstreetbets,"I may be nitpicking but the entire concept is so completely different that it's really not such a stretch to say they should not be interchangeable. The cars we have driven for decades are covered in motors...some the size of a tic tac box, some bigger, some smaller. Nobody in the industry will use the terms interchangeably. Look at Tesla's own site, look at Lucid, all of them. I see a ton of inaccurate things being said in here and so I'm thinking...""do some of these people still think there is somehow an engine on this truck?"""

2021-04-06 22:25:59,wallstreetbets,"I will admit I am looking at this from an American standpoint. Death rates plummeting from the winter/holiday gatherings. Your numbers are wrong when confining the numbers to the US.

Everything opening back up, and vaccinations picking up speed. They‚Äôre open to the general public in many areas, having reached peak penetration in essential workers, elderly, and other Tier 1s.
Large public gatherings of all kinds increasing. 
Hospitals ending their restrictions on elective surgeries, with cases reaching new highs in March. 
Roads are getting busier each week.

People are ready for this to be over, and the people get what the people want."

2021-04-07 13:54:21,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre right - we‚Äôre past COVID because we‚Äôre past peak infections, and vaccinations will continue to bring the numbers down. COVID will exist forever, just like the Spanish flu strain still floats around.

But the unnecessary precautions are ending, and the (once) necessary ones will be, too."
2021-04-07 10:57:59,wallstreetbets,Just because things are sold out doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre flying off the shelves. Stock shortage is just as much a production issue. A lot of production has slowed down over the last year.

2021-04-07 03:59:55,wallstreetbets,Its a great tool. The Senate one hasn't helped me much in terms of actually trading. I got interested in tracking their moves when news broke that a couple of them sold huge positions right before the pandemic thanks to inside info. But most of the updates I have seen have been useless as they seem to buy/sell boomer stocks mainly.

On the other hand, that one dude that keeps trading the same few energy stocks is probably doing that himself.

Unrelated question: Your project seems to be picking up where https://www.opensecrets.org/personal-finances stopped. Would it make sense for your two sites to have some sort of ongoing collaboration?"

2021-04-07 11:25:10,wallstreetbets,yeah i've been waiting for that movie for forever.  the original movie was perfectly cheesy with action and why we go to the movies.
2021-04-07 11:35:26,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I watched an old copy of the original so many times as a kid. Never saw it on the big screen, so Top Gun 2 in the theater is on the 2021 bucket list."
2021-04-06 23:35:16,wallstreetbets,"Haha first of all, what the heck is your obsession with Fauci, you definitely have intense political bias here. I could care less about the guy or what he says. I'm not getting my information exclusively from him. He seems to be more of a PR scientific spokesman than other things

Regardless, you cite CNBC as a source....lol. And who said the vaccines WAS permanent? Flu vaccines aren't lifelong. You clearly know absolutely nothing about biology, epidemiology, or anything science related. Guarantee your highest education is high school; or, if you got a degree its in like business. My point is you know so, so much less than you think you do. You've been mesmerized and bedazzled by media. Have you ever, legitimately, read an actual scientific study? Have you ever critically analyzed the methods of a study (sample size, controls, etc), made judgements about the conclusion the author draws? I highly, highly doubt you have in any intellectual setting. I have never even made many assertions here, I am generally unsure. I stay skeptical. But a lot of people a lot smarter than me did a lot of work to get where we are. Pretending I can critique that is arrogant. 

I'll leave you with this Bertrand Russell quote that is the epitome of you. ""The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts.""
Stop being so sure of yourself friend."
2021-04-07 10:46:15,wallstreetbets,Everything you said is wrong. Completely wrong. But whatever you wanna believe. I tried to give you information that you trust. Cause I know what I trust and where to get accurate info. My main point in this whole convo..Fuck the mask and fuck the shot. They‚Äôre bullshit and so is the way we been living for the last year.
2021-04-07 10:55:01,wallstreetbets,Lol What's your education level?
2021-04-07 10:55:23,wallstreetbets,Your momma
2021-04-07 11:01:10,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. High school education, at best. 

I never even fucking claimed anything. I never said anything about masks; and I stated the general vaccination science, not even claiming anything is 100% true.

Your idiocy is projecting here bud, just stop. Someone with no actual education in the subject, why should we listen to you? 

You also never answered the question, have you ever, ever looked at a scientific study and analyzed it? I really doubt it. 

Here you are, high school education, no experience analyzing or critiquing studies, stating things with 100% confidence in a complex scientific realm. Lol.... gotta love confident reddit idiots"
2021-04-07 11:04:12,wallstreetbets,"No dude, I‚Äôm just done with the conversation. Are you high school educated or can you not tell?"
2021-04-07 11:11:34,wallstreetbets,"Got my doctorate in a scientific realm, certainly more qualified than you, and here I am NOT making grand confident claims."
2021-04-07 11:37:03,wallstreetbets,Good for you! I know a ton of stupid people with one. I‚Äôm talking to one right now.
2021-04-07 13:29:37,wallstreetbets,"I never even made any claims, I was just questioning your confidence in what your saying is 100%. Bruh your fucking crazy lol."
2021-04-07 14:02:39,wallstreetbets,"No, the public is crazy for thinking this will somehow end and go back to normal. Two weeks to flatten the curve and here we are a year later. You can call me crazy, but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact of this virus having a 99.9% survival rate for those under 40 and thus no need to get the shot. Right now, there‚Äôs small evidence saying the shot prevents infecting others. But there‚Äôs also evidence to contrary through viral shedding. So just get your shot and wear your mask and listen to your lies. But I‚Äôm good, I‚Äôm not going to do any of that."
2021-04-07 15:44:25,wallstreetbets,"Bruh you keep changing the subject, making assumptions about what I agree with or not.  

You bring up vaccine trials, then move to length of immunity, then move to masks, then to Fauci, then to curve flattening, then to survival rate.

I disagree vehemently with many decisions we as a country made. But your all over the place man, each thing you brought up is so very different than the next; and each thing requires extensive analysis to see if that was effective, if it was prudent at the time, etc. At least be specific with your grievances or just shut the fuck up."
2021-04-07 16:35:08,wallstreetbets,You don‚Äôt think those subjects are interrelated? Are you trolling or what?
2021-04-07 18:19:17,wallstreetbets,"Yea but each one needs an in-depth analysis. I never said I agree with all covid measures taken, everything about masks, everything fauci said, the vaccine etc. yea they‚Äôre related but each a very expansive topic. Let‚Äôs just both go our separate ways. 

Your confidence in your information just absolutely shocked me. ‚ÄúIdiots so sure of themselves...‚Äù and this all started with me broadly saying on PRINCIPLE, vaccines protect the populace. Then you went off."
2021-04-07 18:34:44,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm all for a vaccine if it‚Äôs safe and effective. And for a serious disease. Like mmr, smallpox, polio, etc.

Also it‚Äôs kind of not fair to try to compare membership grocery store prices. Those prices are subsidized by your membership fees, and especially by the membership fees of the people who pay the fee but rarely shop there. 

The (more expensive) organic Kirkland olive oil is (more likely to be) real olive oil. It‚Äôs what I buy and it‚Äôs the last deal still out there in olive oil. Most people aren‚Äôt buying it. Most people don‚Äôt know any better and are buying canola oil in an olive oil bottle. 

The California sourced (not the foreign sourced) bottles from California Olive Ranch are real olive oil. They used to be $20 for a half gallon. Now they are $10 for 16oz."

2021-04-07 15:17:34,wallstreetbets,"If you have read about family that basically runs VIAC (it's like some medieval high court drama with those fucks) they been reported saying that to complete with major streamers (Netflix and others) all smaller media companies have to consolidate into one mega corp to have bargaining power for sports streaming and media portfolio that can compete with major streamers. They been saying this for a while actually and the first step was to merge Viacom with CBS. That came to be (with some corporate drama) and now rumour is that when this merger is digested ViacomCBS will merge with Discovery (and it's quite legit rumour confirmed from multi sources). Also, there are other rumours (less confirmed) that ViacomCBS might buy out or merge with Lionsgate and/or MGM. They been eyeing Sony studios but Sony is unlikely to sell. Anyway, if all goes to plan in few years time we could have mega streaming corp that owns most of the ""legacy"" TV shows and films. At current valuation of 11x p/e (priced for nuclear war) I'm willing to take long bet and wait this out for few years. I think there could be some very nice appreciation."
2021-04-07 08:07:56,wallstreetbets,They are buying a Latin American broadcaster instead... :)
2021-04-07 13:47:40,wallstreetbets,Good bot
2021-04-07 15:59:52,wallstreetbets,"It's nice to read comments from someone who is not brain dead retard like 99% of population here. All your points are valid but I think there's more with VIAC than meets the eye. I won't go into much detail here but Redstone family (people who own VIAC) are not stupid. They realise that their business is toast if they don't do something about it. Their plan is to consolidate all the old media companies as soon as possible to gain scale and build up big media portfolio. They recently merged Viacom and CBS and it looks like they are planning to merge with Discovery at some point later. There are also rumours of them eyeing Lionsgate and MGM. Plus they been buying smaller media companies as of late. If all goes to plant in few years time we could have mega corp who owns most of the old TV media, films and has long license to air sports. That's good on its own but what's even better is that VIAC does not care that much about having the best streaming platform but about having the best media portfolio. When Disney launched their streaming platform they pulled their IP from Netflix because they want exclusivity. When VIAC launched their streaming platform they still licensed their IP to Amazon and Netflix and they have stated that they will continue to do so. In my view that quite unique approach and actually very good approach. Let Amazon build infra and app and just license your massive portfolio to them. While also streaming stuff yourself. Everybody wins. Now those mergers could not work out, things could go bad and all that. True. But with current valuation going long on shares. I think odds are in my favour."

:)"
2021-04-07 16:54:17,wallstreetbets,"I dont agree at all with the strategy you're outlining here.

1)  The content makers take all the risk in the model you're proposing.  One season they've got the best shows and they're on top.  The next season someone else has the best shows and they're fucked.  When you control the distribution channel, you have a cushion against those sort of ups and downs, but when you don't, it is rough.  In the ecosystem you're outlining, the Netflix's make money no matter what-- the people licensing to them are living feast or famine.

2)  Amazon and Netflix are not pure-play streaming platforms any more.  They make their own content now.  So every time you do dealings with them, they're gonna have their finger on the scale-- they're gonna promote their own stuff over yours, give you the short end of the algorithm whenever they want.  Your content creators will always be playing handicapped against their content creators-- and if that's the state of affairs, how hard will it be for the shops with streaming platforms to poach your creatives (or sports licenses) from you?

3)  Mergers with other similarly positioned players don't magically modernize your company, it's just a doubling down on the model that's losing.  Owning the back catalogue of The Dick Van Dyke show AND I Love Lucy is not going to magically solve anything.

4)  They don't have the cash to fund significant acquisitions.  Which means they'll have to offer stock instead.  Why would I want to invest in a stock that has ""DILUTION SOON"" in big red letters over it?

5)  Even if the leadership of Viacom is convinced that the solution to their weak streaming platform is to merge with everyone else that has a shitty streaming platform, who's to say their M&A targets agree?  Again, there's no synergy.  You're a $30b left shoe trying to convince another $30b left shoe to form a giant $60b left shoe.  Meanwhile a $300b right shoe could be on the other line with your M&A target, making a better offer.  How are you going to outbid them if they decide they want what you're after?  And if they don't want what you're trying to eat, doesn't that say something about the quality of your meal?

6)  Mergers make you bigger, which makes you harder to be acquired by someone else, and being acquired by someone else is, in my view, one of the best things that could happen to a VIAC shareholder in a world in which they cant get their own foothold in the streaming world.

-----

I agree on at least one point, which is that Viacom is cheap.  They're one of the cheapest ways to buy a dollar of earnings on the market today.  And on that basis alone I'd rate it neutral.  But I would sell it in an instant if they merged with a company that did not have a successful streaming platform.

And if Viacom is going to aggressively push mergers, I would rather own the stock of the companies they're going to be making the lucrative offers to.  Why buy VIAC if they're going to offer Discovery a sweetheart deal?  Just buy Discovery instead."
2021-04-07 15:30:27,wallstreetbets,"Yea, VIAC is in most value ETSs too."

2021-04-07 17:19:45,wallstreetbets,When in April is this rumored demo supposed to happen?
2021-04-06 22:11:17,wallstreetbets,Where can I listen to the earnings call?
2021-04-07 17:00:10,wallstreetbets,I wanna see your gains!
2021-04-07 17:06:35,wallstreetbets,This was a hell of a good call. I bought the 280's.
2021-04-07 06:40:39,wallstreetbets,They are massively hiring software engineering talent for their Denver office. Positions appear to have heavy focus on consumer side for scaling CTV revenue. The September 35c look like a great gamble right now.
2021-04-07 11:54:47,wallstreetbets,"It's a genuine question. I wasn't here before GME, but from what I've seen that seemed to be the case. I am retarded though, no point trying to hide that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2021-04-07 12:50:48,wallstreetbets,I am also retarded. Retard is an anagram for trader and has been around forever. Autist has also been around forever and is kind of a term of endearment and I believe started as a reference to Michael Burry who is actually autistic. He was played by Christian bale in the big short.
2021-04-07 12:51:19,wallstreetbets,Ape did start with GME though.
2021-04-07 12:52:50,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
2021-04-07 15:51:43,wallstreetbets,"LMFAO I was just reading all the comments here IT WON'T GO ANY HIGHER lmfaoooooo. Held my 240C and sold today, then bought puts. Ride it both ways. Congrats on the fat gains you have if you didn't sell yet."
2021-04-07 19:08:13,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, they were a bunch of paper handed pussies. I sold today for 4K more than what I would have got if I had sold when everyone was telling me to. Bought TSM calls for my next play."
2021-04-07 06:21:40,wallstreetbets,Brought on by hedgies and shorts. NOK is about to rise up!
2021-04-07 00:18:23,wallstreetbets,Are y‚Äôall checking out MSO‚Äôs. Already established here. Worst outcome is the Canadian LP‚Äôs buy them out. I like Columbia Care and Cresco
2021-04-07 00:22:08,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I was thinking about making a post about MSO's too, although this aphria play is more about the merger than federal legalization right now."
2021-04-07 00:33:15,wallstreetbets,Ya true. I just really like MSO‚Äôs. In a lot of legal states the demand is still higher than the supply. Illinois is almost on pace to double the number of sales from 2020. Canadian companies definitely have room to grow but nowhere near American ones
2021-04-06 20:48:10,wallstreetbets,I was driving from Cali to Nevada. Damn today was a nice dip for some MT and CLF long calls. Looks like the bull cycle is just getting warmed up! üòé
2021-04-07 04:26:59,wallstreetbets,Anything yet?
2021-04-07 08:26:40,wallstreetbets,Touch√©
2021-04-07 14:07:58,wallstreetbets,"Since we continue to average down on our stocks, does the IRS look at first in last out? For example if you bought at $300 a share and you manage the average down to $100 by buying a ton of stock when the price went down to say $40. Are the two blocks separate? Meaning even if you break even When does stock reaches the average downed price, wouldn't it mean that you sold at a loss from the $300 a share block and sold at a larger profit from the $40 a share block? And you would still have to pay taxes on that $40 a share block increase to whatever the break-even point share price is."
2021-04-06 21:38:20,wallstreetbets,woohoo
2021-04-07 11:13:48,wallstreetbets,"Love this play on both PSXP and ET.

Looking at past activity back in July 2020 (the last time the announced a DAPL shutdown), PSXP dropped 6$ and ET dropped 1$.

I like PSXP 27.5p and ET 7.5p & 7p for April 16 date. Both are nice and cheap, low IV.

Too good to pass up! LFG!"
