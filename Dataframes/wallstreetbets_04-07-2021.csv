2021-04-07 19:47:53,wallstreetbets,Morgan Stanley prob has a large position they are trying to unload.
2021-04-07 19:29:42,wallstreetbets,"Anyone else sick of politicians pouring millions of dollars into stocks, just to days later announce legislation or plans that directly benefit the exact stocks they invested in? Like when pelosi dumped over a million dollars into tesla 3 days before biden announced they were switching the USPS fleet to electric vehicles

Edit: 3 days is more like a month because people dont understand exaggeration"
2021-04-07 19:31:26,wallstreetbets,Read exactly how much of this trillion dollar BS is actually going to the infrastructure
2021-04-07 19:50:45,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is not a good inflation play.  The infrastructure bill, like the recent stimulus bill, is long on pork and short on help and improvements.  Eating might be a bigger concern than investing in 4 years.  Pray we survive better than CA, NY, or Chicago under this same idiotic leadership."

2021-04-07 19:49:37,wallstreetbets,"oh god forbid i be accurate and say the nancy never bought stocks 3 days before the order was signed like OP said and that her husband bought call options instead a month before. 

im sorry for correcting the chain of events. 

edit: op is still wrong. keep downvoting tho."
2021-04-07 19:55:26,wallstreetbets,"Call options? You mean a more volatile and therefore more profitable investment of your money if you can """"""""predict"""""""" the direction the stock is going?"
2021-04-07 19:56:41,wallstreetbets,ok? i dont understand what kind of point you're trying to make like you got me. i never said nancy is the pinnacle of ethics. i said that she didnt buy stocks 3 days before and that her husband bought calls a month before.

2021-04-07 17:17:09,wallstreetbets,"I picked up some shares at $29.15 last week the day before they unveiled their new spacecraft. Didn't even register on the stock price. 

I think investors are numb to this company until they actually have a successful test or three. Maybe there will be a jump at a successful test but you need to have your finger on the sell button ready to take profits because that shit'll come back down faster than the VSS Enterprise."
2021-04-07 17:14:01,wallstreetbets,I upvote anything with rocket emojis.

2021-04-07 16:58:51,wallstreetbets,Rocket Lab is the space play until SpaceX IPOs. At least Rocket Lab has a proven track record.
2021-04-07 19:13:03,wallstreetbets,SPCE is the NKLA of Space
2021-04-07 19:39:54,wallstreetbets,I'll buy SPCE below 10 this year

2021-04-07 17:25:28,wallstreetbets,I’m going to wait until earnings crash. 5/5 to consider anything with SPCE.
2021-04-07 19:55:26,wallstreetbets,"Precisely because now you and everyone else expect a runup to the test flight date and a crash after, is why that pattern is not gonna happen"
2021-04-07 19:06:17,wallstreetbets,They need a successful test flight first I think. SPCE has been dropping ever since they had to delay their last test flight.
2021-04-07 16:55:46,wallstreetbets,"someone probably was saying it at 57, but it wasn’t me ;)"
2021-04-07 17:26:37,wallstreetbets,Is that the ticker VACQ?? Not even sure I’m allowed to mention it but just making sure
2021-04-07 19:30:19,wallstreetbets,"yah, I work in the industry, I would totally invest in SpaceX, I would never invest in SPCE."

2021-04-07 16:54:22,wallstreetbets,Fair enough. Respectable response
2021-04-07 19:39:21,wallstreetbets,"they have a reliable track record but they haven't hit their stride or launch schedule yet.  I don't follow them too closely, but I heard they are starting to try recovering boosters, that might help them a bit or it could bite them in the ass."
2021-04-07 16:35:07,wallstreetbets,So you are calling the top was two days ago and were all fucked from here if we aren’t short or cash?
2021-04-07 16:43:20,wallstreetbets,"US 10 Year bond is flat because Japan started to buy shitloads...US yields look pretty, pretty, pretty good to other countries with near zero yields."

2021-04-07 16:47:21,wallstreetbets,How did the market tank today?  DOW and S&P were a bit up and NSDQ barely down!

2021-04-07 16:37:40,wallstreetbets,"The FED has something like 1/3 of housing, corporate debt, etc. on the books now and nobody finds that alarming. The discontinuance of M1/M2 tracking is also something that should raise alarms. The amount of zombie companies in existence? The growing issues cropping up worldwide?

It's all one broken game that made the wealthy wealthier."
2021-04-07 16:34:21,wallstreetbets,Super bullish

2021-04-07 19:40:01,wallstreetbets,SPY hit ATH. Higher low 7 days in a row. The fuck you expect. It's called consolidation.
2021-04-07 18:13:39,wallstreetbets,"Biden’s tax plan has the market by the balls right now. Some companies will be alright, but others will be completely screwed. The policy will be far worse than the hints they have dropped recently. This was expected by most people with a functioning brain."

2021-04-07 18:40:00,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, i strongly disagree with OP. And my strategy is unhindered by 5 years of 80% off securities. Ill just use my commodity profits to buy these on sale securities. Problem solved. (Stop buying with margin people,  and stop over leveraging if you do). Stop yoloing and start averaging in, especially once the crash starts.

Or y'all are essentially putting everything down on red as the craps ball settles on black."
2021-04-07 18:43:27,wallstreetbets,Sounds FUD to me.
2021-04-07 18:48:00,wallstreetbets,All I understood from this is that I should go all in in short term calls
2021-04-07 18:53:10,wallstreetbets,Capital requirements have been tightened as the fed stress test ends. Over leveraged positions exposed. Only a few sectors were corrected. Rotation covered losses. There was no crash. You just purchased at the top.

I can see another similar correction like in March happening soon. All the signs are there."
2021-04-07 19:17:13,wallstreetbets,What the fuck are you talking about? This dude is prolly one of the 🌈🧸‘s over at CNBC.  When did the market tank? Have you heard of basing out? Sectors rallied for a few days. They base out and then go higher. No one gives a shit about bonds and yields and interest.  People stopped caring. None of that matters.

2021-04-07 17:28:04,wallstreetbets,"He's just commenting more or less on the stimulus sugar high. If you look at growth over the last year since covid hit it's not healthy. There is a major market correction incoming likely starting in tech. But that will trickle over into everything. Your long positions will take a hit but recover. Longer term options plays are probably pretty risky right now. Personally I am out of tech but long on solar, looking for infrastructure positions, bag holding UWMC (it'll come around)."

2021-04-07 18:04:22,wallstreetbets,For real. I cannot believe how smart some of these bears are. They predict a correction will happen before the Sun dies out. How can they predict shit like this? Incredible.
2021-04-07 18:06:26,wallstreetbets,Well who knows what he is talking about. That's how I read it but I have a tendency to kind of fill in the gaps.
2021-04-07 18:51:16,wallstreetbets,I should be selling puts and spreading FUD (even though that FUD is completely realistic and based in 'reality')
2021-04-07 17:18:04,wallstreetbets,Great reference
2021-04-07 18:30:59,wallstreetbets,Now we get into the weird stuff :)

2021-04-07 17:30:12,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I don't want us to be bent over by China if we were to fuck with them directly. They gonna be a bigger economic power/military than us in the next 20 years."
2021-04-07 19:17:21,wallstreetbets,No? Our military is still far away ahead

2021-04-07 17:40:36,wallstreetbets,This has been going on for decades. Proxy wars all the way back to the 50s and 60s.
2021-04-07 17:33:02,wallstreetbets,Never happen. Our military is as large as the second thru tenth countries combined on the list. The old Ussr tried to match our military spending and they went tits up.
2021-04-07 18:08:39,wallstreetbets,You're..
2021-04-07 17:41:25,wallstreetbets,"Thank you.  Folks here don't realize we always maintain a 20 year advantage.  Even our Hypersonic failures are just disinformation ops.  China is major land force on it's own soil, but we dominate the seas and space."

2021-04-07 17:48:36,wallstreetbets,You are correct young man. Nice to communicate with someone who’s head isn’t buried deep in their culo.
2021-04-07 17:51:59,wallstreetbets,So true I would actually put it at a30 year advantage based on the technology in that drone Iran downed during the Obama administration.
2021-04-07 18:14:56,wallstreetbets,"In the cyber race for dominance, China is light years ahead of the United States.  We can have all the tanks and carriers we want, but a teenager in uniform can cripple our economy and infrastructure both, by typing a / and pressing enter."
2021-04-07 17:50:45,wallstreetbets,Video is fubar. What he’s referring to as a manpower advantage is just that they have way more useless eaters than us.
2021-04-07 19:25:17,wallstreetbets,"They have about 40 more ships, and millions more troops. 
However our ships and servicemen are far superior or they wouldn’t keep stealing our technology.
We have almost 2000 more combat aircraft! The best fighters in the world by far...and we have the Marines and space age weaponry.
Boom! Just saying...."

2021-04-07 18:00:52,wallstreetbets,moneys all that matters
2021-04-07 18:40:46,wallstreetbets,"Don't sweat it.  She/It/Adeadmind probably too brainwashed or stupid on historical facts that we took an entire country plus it's regions in 100 hours, and an entire Eastern Block of the world in less than 8 years, saving all of humanity in the process.  Sometimes living in a basement does that to grown-ass people with no mind of their own."
2021-04-07 19:41:41,wallstreetbets,"Well, at a minimum we know the capabilities include gaining access to and stealing PII from both government agencies and civilian economic powerhouses.  We know this because they already do it.  Their government sponsors hackers, potentially in the tens of thousands, in both the public and private.  This is not a secret."
2021-04-07 19:30:30,wallstreetbets,Photus Buyden has absolutely no input on any military decisions. The military is taking orders from Trump who is in Mar a lago. Buyden is President of a bankrupt corporation who is residing on a movie set White House at castle rock studios. He’s not even allowed in the Pentagon. Sleep tight my friend. The best is yet to come.
2021-04-07 18:02:56,wallstreetbets,Murica baby! Don’t tread on us!
2021-04-07 18:21:34,wallstreetbets,Well if thats all that matters we nearly spend three times the amount China does on military and almost 15 times the amount then the Russians. If moneys all that matters.
2021-04-07 19:21:12,wallstreetbets,Murica baby!
2021-04-07 19:47:18,wallstreetbets,Our own government is working to destroy our nation. A company by the name of Loral years ago sold our technology to China at President Clinton’s request. Pelosi helped engineer a sale of GE to a CCP company. They make many defense products for our military. Trump squashed the sale. The point I’m trying to make is the leaders of these countries are all in the same club that hate us. Who knows what really happens when there’s a major hack. It could be our corrupt politicians transferring information for cash under the guise of a hack.
2021-04-07 19:33:50,wallstreetbets,I think I heard that somewhere
2021-04-07 18:53:08,wallstreetbets,I wish we cared about our vets as much as you care about your glory
2021-04-07 19:55:27,wallstreetbets,You don’t think mailing a thumb drive would be easier?
2021-04-07 19:36:17,wallstreetbets,More people are realizing something is very off. Trump waiting as long as he can so more people get their heads out of their asses. He doesn’t realize a lot of people will never get it. This ending is not for everyone.
2021-04-07 19:58:29,wallstreetbets,"How are they getting the intelligence from GE? GE is a public company. Not a nationalized company. If the intel wasn’t available to them, which it’s not, a sale is the only way."
2021-04-07 19:42:00,wallstreetbets,"Ok, now you’re getting into the conspiracy area. Trump is loving life and turning orange again. After the way this country treated him, I would be surprised if he wanted to endure the BS again. On the other hand Biden has to be the dumbest president ever. After all he was the dumbest person to serve in the senate, and the dumbest to be Vice President. He has the trifecta"
2021-04-07 19:51:46,wallstreetbets,"A lie is a lie, even if everyone believes it. The truth is the truth, even if nobody believes it.
Go on bitchute and watch some x22 report videos, or Charli Ward, or Simon Parkes. They get high end intel from people who are in the room. They’re all saying the same thing. I believe them. The only way this information gets to the dummies is through an EBS message. Have you noticed an increase in EBS testing. Supposed to be once a month. I viewed 2 of them yesterday."

2021-04-07 17:05:11,wallstreetbets,I heard his biggest investment is gored futures so you know if I were you I would buy some chords. You can even like literally go to the supermarket and buy gourds and if you just hold on to those gourds for long enough you'll be able to take him back and they will give you a higher price so discover supermarket and buy a couple $1000 in ornamental gourds
2021-04-07 17:23:37,wallstreetbets,"Long time(long, long time) BRK investor.  Thing is, its really hard to time and its had a good run.   Personally should get a good pop after earnings but after your expiration.   Right now the company can't buy back stock(blackout prior to earnings).   I just buy shares and trade in and out of them.  Options on this stock probably very tricky because trading volumes are so low.   It can easily go nowhere for months then gap up.  I would probably book the $7K gain.   
 Good luck."
2021-04-07 16:46:26,wallstreetbets,"Why cash out Brk.B is the most well diversified undervalued company right now.

Accounting rules make it so that berkshire can only count dividends paid from its subsidiaries as income...

Also, BRK has a better credit rating then the u.s govt now."
2021-04-07 18:32:39,wallstreetbets,"If the market goes up big one more day hopefully tomorrow or Friday cash out buddy, if not hope it spikes next week!"
2021-04-07 18:47:17,wallstreetbets,"You could just sell and buy more and scale up as needed, I did that with amd today"
2021-04-07 16:56:33,wallstreetbets,Cash out. Or at least take some profit and maybe let the rest run out
2021-04-07 16:49:25,wallstreetbets,"""Nobody got broke from taking profits..."" thats some deep shit right there"

2021-04-07 16:54:13,wallstreetbets,Any bum on the street has a better credit rating than the US government wtf are you talking about $30T in the hole 😆
2021-04-07 16:51:57,wallstreetbets,"Well, they are calls, and theta exists, and they are 23 dte."
2021-04-07 17:24:50,wallstreetbets,"They also never got rich being conservative... just kidding... sort of. Somewhere right in the middle there is where we should be. OP seems like a fun guy, but should take a quarter or half of it off the table and let it ride. Fun story...

I got into some qqq calls a little over a month ago for 4/30 that went up 4K overnight and held. Tech chopped for this past month and it was a rough time while averaging down throughout. Through much gamblers remorse, alcohol, and anxiety, I was able to close at profit this week. Moral of the story, take your gains when they’re there but be psychotic enough to average down on what seems like a dying position... not weeklies or some bullshit like that though."
2021-04-07 17:04:47,wallstreetbets,😅
2021-04-07 17:03:44,wallstreetbets,So?
2021-04-07 17:16:07,wallstreetbets,"So, a stock being undervalued doesn’t make it ready to climb even higher RIGHT NOW.  Right now those calls are worth something.  If the underlying goes back down or stays the same, profits turns to losses.  Keep in mind the break even price is literally “break even,” so if it stays the same he will break even at expiry.  It is currently AT a significant level of resistance, which means it needs to break that resistance for continued profit, and every day he holds waiting for it to break and shoot up the profit goes down, and if the guess is wrong, well, that ends up being a loss.  You don’t HOLD calls, you take fucking profit.  Especially at a 50% return"
2021-04-07 17:34:26,wallstreetbets,"Dude, your in the wrong sub... and TA doesn't work...

in the biggest bull market in a stock that has very little volatility with a planned shareholder buyback and a month until expiry... if op thinks they are still undervalued which he said he thinks it has more room to run there is little reason to sell them... take profits when you reach your target, not when  it's just getting started."

2021-04-07 18:10:26,wallstreetbets,The problem is his position is currently a short against the company he’s hoping to see rise. That’s how RH works...they wrote him an IOU for his position and used his cash to short against it
2021-04-07 17:42:21,wallstreetbets,4/14 🚀
2021-04-07 17:17:36,wallstreetbets,Definitely a possibility (and one that I would like to see)

2021-04-07 17:04:58,wallstreetbets,The beauty of keeping cash on the sidelines and averaging down! I opened my first position in the 25s and bought all the way down. Bought the last few shares to get to 20k on the {normal} morning dump today.
2021-04-07 17:18:17,wallstreetbets,Already doing it. Selling $65 Jan 2023 calls for around $300 a contract. Will rotate to shorter term if IV spikes.
2021-04-07 18:29:34,wallstreetbets,"Married, sorry bud"
2021-04-07 19:08:43,wallstreetbets,"I bought in when they proved they could apply all the work they’ve done for the government to the commercial sector. I’m a government contractor and have seen the barrier to entry first hand (once you’re in, it takes a whole lot to change). So, I feel Palantir has a solid base in government work. On the commercial side, I can see them taking a lot of market share from the big consulting firms by providing companies with the infrastructure to find solutions to their problems themselves instead of hiring a BCG or Bain to help. I also am convinced their software and talent is superior given their history and hiring process. Remember...the internet was created with DoD advanced research funding 😉"
2021-04-07 19:09:44,wallstreetbets,Will be watching closely
2021-04-07 19:29:29,wallstreetbets,"Currently selling $65 Jan 2023 CC until IV picks up. Then, I’ll rotate to more short term way OTM CC."
2021-04-07 17:21:27,wallstreetbets,"I plan to keep buying for the next 10 months, then sit on them for atleast a year, they can be red from now till next Xmas (aslong as they climb to the promised 50usd  the day I sell obviously 😜)

Has anyone also go in on QELL?? 

I'm not rich enough to buy loads of each in one go so I'm stacking them slowly. 

I'm fresh so rip me a new one if that's to much of a standard question."
2021-04-07 18:46:43,wallstreetbets,Dassit I’m canceling my Verizon plan and going to metro and I work at Verizon LOL!
2021-04-07 19:39:33,wallstreetbets,I'm literally retarded. Can you explain to this moron what this means? Is it that you're selling it at a $65 strike believing that it won't  hit that price and just expire?
2021-04-07 17:39:43,wallstreetbets,"i switched last week to TDA and it was straight forward. doing a full account transfer (about 3 clicks on the new brokerage) takes about a week until you see all your positions. yes, it's a pain and you won't be able to trade for about 3 to 4 days, but now i have peace of mind. i'd actually recommend Fidelity, but either way, i want to assure you that once you make the decision it is pretty easy. similar to you, i started with RH in 2016 so it took a lot of resolve to move out."
2021-04-07 17:00:00,wallstreetbets,I love this place
2021-04-07 19:30:40,wallstreetbets,Dad give you a small loan of a million dollars?
2021-04-07 18:01:53,wallstreetbets,"Everything I've read agrees with you, the contracts they've landed, the talent they employ, etc... I just wish it would reflect in their stock price already"
2021-04-07 17:28:37,wallstreetbets,nice how excited are you for next week?
2021-04-07 16:54:19,wallstreetbets,Good investment for a few years down the road
2021-04-07 17:47:35,wallstreetbets,"DFV, is that you?"
2021-04-07 18:39:55,wallstreetbets,So let’s see a squeeze
2021-04-07 17:10:03,wallstreetbets,Serious question: Why sell the CCs at such a far out expiry? I sell $40 at 45 DTE
2021-04-07 16:59:19,wallstreetbets,What's a deldo and why do you stuff gerbils up your butt?
2021-04-07 17:23:44,wallstreetbets,"I think PLTR is much safer than QELL. And technically if you have a stake in PLTR, you have a stake in QELL."
2021-04-07 17:23:37,wallstreetbets,I’m waiting for it to drop to 21 then I’ll add more
2021-04-07 18:59:04,wallstreetbets,"Haha, T-Mobile ftw 🙌"
2021-04-07 19:42:12,wallstreetbets,"Selling one CC at a strike of $65 means that if the price of PLTR is above $65 on the date of expiration, then I sell 100 shares to the buyer at $65. That’s all 😊 if it isn’t $65 at expiration, I just keep my shares.

So, I sell a CC if I’m ok with selling my shares at $65 in 2 years.

Edit: The downside is, if PLTR is like $200 at expiration, then I’m still selling my shares for $65 (so upside potential is limited)."
2021-04-07 17:49:02,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
2021-04-07 19:36:42,wallstreetbets,"Hahahahaha, I wish he could (but not really if I were completely honest)"
2021-04-07 18:08:52,wallstreetbets,"Arguably it does to a certain extent. 40 P/S is high, so the expectations are high. But, I think the price is pricing in the guidance that they gave on their growth (which I think they sandbagged/undershot guidance on purpose). We’ll see in the coming earnings."
2021-04-07 17:29:39,wallstreetbets,I’ll be watching the double click demo closely. Looking for a dumbed down explanation that is less technical so they can market it better.
2021-04-07 19:52:53,wallstreetbets,So teenage jesus then?
2021-04-07 17:15:24,wallstreetbets,"The calls won’t bite me in the butt unless this actually does more than 3x in less than 2 years. And even then, I’m ok with selling at $65 in 2 years."
2021-04-07 17:13:56,wallstreetbets,"Good question, IV is relatively low right now, so further DTE calls have more time premium instead of IV. If IV picks up, I can always rotate into shorter term CC."
2021-04-07 19:52:18,wallstreetbets,Lemmiwinks is just checking for colon cancer.
2021-04-07 19:45:51,wallstreetbets,That makes sense. Thanks for the clear explanation ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)
2021-04-07 18:09:15,wallstreetbets,Def take this advice...I’m w Ameritrade also...it’ll be free for you with ur giant fucking portfolio...RH is using ur money to short against PLTR right now...do the tranfer tomorrow...they’re legit begging for money even w an IPO coming out..they are fucked dude. I can’t believe I’m giving this advice to some1 playing w $500k
2021-04-07 19:35:29,wallstreetbets,i dont even bother to watch i am just gambling on pltr calls

2021-04-07 19:18:27,wallstreetbets,"I ended up breaking even on my weeklies that I bought around $26 before it rose, then I sold on the crash down. I had $25k in $30 Jan 2022 calls that I doubled but that was about it. I'm back for another stab at it."
2021-04-07 17:02:26,wallstreetbets,That was merely the exploratory committee to figure out where we would land. It returned faster than expected and we've been waiting to refuel.
2021-04-07 17:00:28,wallstreetbets,Those three listed are actually one single sale of 500 million. That sale was a private sale at above market price likely to a major investor (my money is on Buffett) and was to fund a charitable donation and actually bodes very well for the stock.
2021-04-07 16:47:52,wallstreetbets,It's been covered in the news. Priced in with this week's drop.
2021-04-07 18:04:10,wallstreetbets,Source?

2021-04-07 17:43:01,wallstreetbets,True but they enjoyed the current valuation from what they did last year.  Going forward with the rates rising they will be valued less.

2021-04-07 19:30:17,wallstreetbets,Welcome home 💎🦍💎🦍
2021-04-07 18:02:54,wallstreetbets,"It has a shit ton to do with mortgage rates but not everything. Mortgage rates are barely ticking up and are actually going down again. 

“Today’s mortgage refinance rates have fallen since last Thursday, with 20-year rates dropping below 3% for the first time in seven days. Average rates across all loan types remain low at 2.719%. “"
2021-04-07 18:10:36,wallstreetbets,"I'm looking at the 30yr fixed and it has risen 20% from the beginning of the year.  If the trend continues, it'll be bad for RKT.  If it drops, it'll be good for RKT.  That's all I'm saying.  But the trend for the rest of the year is upward. Higher inflation, higher yield on 10yr note which leads to higher mortgage rates.  But hope OP makes a killing on his position."
2021-04-07 18:13:19,wallstreetbets,He will on the next earnings call. I might throw 100k on as well.

hold on, you mean to tell me kangadoood that the margin on guns is only 1-2% and the ammo backlog means they aren’t selling more ammo, but actually less? wait, they’ve been limiting the amount of ammo to purchase for months? they also have serious logistical problems in their supply chain...?

2021-04-07 16:51:40,wallstreetbets,"Just completed my single largest transaction:

Bought Jan 23 $500 $TSLA call. Had to sell or close over 40+ lots of shares, CCs, CSPs, and LEAPs to do so. I have a few accounts so still hold many of them elsewhere. Sick of some these plays honestly and why not go harder on my highest conviction plays 🤷‍♂️ and way less work. 

I also sold a $820 5/14 CC for $1135. Plan is to make a $1K+ a month selling safe CCs and to 2X this position over the next year. 

That is my plan anyway and those don’t don’t understand $TSLA don’t understand this new market. 

Good luck to all!"

Other EV manufacturers will be competing for every car sale now with Biden’s EV plan. I like GM only because Biden has $174 billion for the EV market and I see GM getting a big chunk of that. The government ALWAYS supports GM because they provide too many jobs and the feds cannot see them fail. I own GM stock now. Also, I own a lot of BB stock that I bought long before the meme stock craze and still hold. All the EV manufacturers will be competing to sell a car while BB’s QNX/IVY platform will (already has) secured the operating system for almost all of them. Big VW announcement today with BB and BB currently has 23 out of the top 25 EV manufacturers as customers. You probably know all this, but I don’t understand how everyone on WSB does not see it with BB. I bought more BB yesterday for $8.99. I hold 5,000 shares now. BB, GM and VW are the EV plays for me.

Why such a high premium.. bc nobody pays attention to it anyways right? Wgaf. That’s why I make so much money on stonks. Bc I never learned addition or subtraction that’s for idiots. No wonder there’s no inflation.. when you take your stimmy and unemployment checks and flush them down the toilet. Pow could print $100 trillion give it to this sub and the dollar would go up in value. Like magic. People wonder why banks/brokerages are reporting record profits.. during a global pandemic. Lmfao.

2021-04-07 18:55:35,wallstreetbets,"Listen up WSB and hear me out. I’m not sure about Tesla any longer. I used to own Tesla stock, but got in cheap and sold at $700. I posted today that GM might be the EV play going forward. Other EV manufacturers will be competing for every car sale now with Biden’s EV plan. I like GM only because Biden has $174 billion for the EV market and I see GM getting a big chunk of that. The government ALWAYS supports GM because they provide too many jobs and the feds cannot see them fail. I own GM stock now. Also, I own a lot of BB stock that I bought long before the meme stock craze and still hold. All the EV manufacturers will be competing to sell a car while BB’s QNX/IVY platform will (already has) secured the operating system for almost all of them. Big Volvo announcement today with BB and BB currently has 23 out of the top 25 EV manufacturers as customers. You probably know all this, but I don’t understand how everyone on WSB does not see it with BB. I bought more BB yesterday for $8.99. I hold 5,000 shares now at less than that average. Also, stop selling your s**t because a politician has something to say, the same thing  they’ve said for the last 3 weeks. I’m pretty sure Queen Cathie didn’t liquidate her portfolio today because Biden or JPow had something to say. She probably bought more of everything she owns actually. Pretty sure Warren Buffet held all his stuff and, funny enough, owns about 9% of the Chinese EV manufacturer BYD and has never owned Tesla last I checked. Do the North American EV plays where the Biden money is."

2021-04-07 19:36:50,wallstreetbets,"There's no shame in cutting your losses if you think there's no hope, but here's some copium:

1). Literally no one could have predicted JPM dumping today unless they're an insider: ASO is/was a good play when you bought in (unless you bought at market open in which case....you never buy at market open. There were PLENTY of dips to get in)


2). During average volume and above-average volume, ASO held above $30 and $31 completely rock solid. It took AH swing trading and the aforementioned JPM to break that.


3). On the order book right now, the LOWEST sell order is a $31.72.


4). Even for 4/16s there is still 7 trading days left for a solid recovery that should enable you to get close to your break-even, if not past it, this time with less JPM fuckery.

Watch tomorrow's price action and decide for yourself what to do. Me personally, I'm holding and maybe even averaging down until I'm certain that there's no support left for the next two weeks; tomorrow and Friday should make the direction abundantly clear one way or the other."
2021-04-07 19:40:24,wallstreetbets,Almost recovered? It went from -6% to -4%. Dead 🐈

A) dump their plays specifically

B) actually that's just the only one"
2021-04-07 16:37:38,wallstreetbets,"The indices literally only move when the stocks move. But a big index swing can be a few winners with a lot of losers, a bunch of little winners, or one big winner in a sea of losers.

Different hedging strategies and the resulting beta can destroy certain stocks because the money is being moved from less reliable positions to more reliable ones.

A high index is just as good as a low index for a trader. Just a different sentiment."

2021-04-07 18:23:03,wallstreetbets,"Woahhh yea pull back buddy. Quit it for a few days and you’ll detox pretty quick from caffeine. Then start back at much much lower doses. 

I bet your sleep is terrible. Prioritize it. Get 8 hours, not 7. And it needs to be quality. No caffeine after 3pm, make it pretty damn cold in your room, wear socks, try an eye mask. All those are proven to work"
2021-04-07 18:24:39,wallstreetbets,"I’m not sure if this is serious, but I’d be careful. It didn’t bother me in my 20s, but around 30 I had some issues. I was also around 600-700 mg daily. I’ve never had anxiety or health issues, and wound up in the ER for “heart issues”. Ended up being caused by caffeine, triggering GERD, leading to a prolonged inflamed chest cavity, and panic attacks mimicking a heart attack. This is obviously just my experience, but I’d scale back. I’m all sorted out now, but 10/10 I don’t recommend! Everyone’s different though. 🤷‍♂️"
2021-04-07 18:19:01,wallstreetbets,"just do blow as an antagonist and you should
be fine"
2021-04-07 18:21:38,wallstreetbets,"looked it up, some health agency said 600 mg/day for adult should be limit

200mg at once should give you noticeable effects

400mg at once should make you feel enough to make you mildly uncomfortable

if that ain't doing it for you go for coke or speed"
2021-04-07 18:18:23,wallstreetbets,"Nah, probably not a good idea to do both at once."

2021-04-07 19:13:45,wallstreetbets,"I actually 100% agree. Obviously there’s risk in quick flip of shares and such, but it’s really not the yolo that puts or calls are. And if it’s a yolo into a stable ticker off bad news you simply wait and make money anyways just later than expected. It’s like wearing a condom with a hooker vs going in raw."

The simple fact is for a company like TSM the chances of it dropping down below 110 for an extended period of time is astronomically small. I'm not timing the bottom, I'm timing the curve. As long as I get in within a reasonable distance to the bottom, I win."

2021-04-07 17:30:15,wallstreetbets,"That is absolutely the case. I just think its funny that none of them have considered that if any of the bullshit they're slinging was actually true, they could make significantly more money just waiting for it to happen **before** opening a position. Like none of them believe it is going to stay at ""$1,000,000"" a share, its baked into their ""thesis"" that hedgefunds will cover and liquidate immediately. Their plan is already to sell on the way down. 

Why not cut out the actual risk portion of this process and just wait for the squeeze and enter short positions? I mean a lot of people did that in January and made out like bandits. There is no logical reason to buy and hold indefinitely when you could put your money to work elsewhere and capitalize on the fall."
2021-04-07 16:37:12,wallstreetbets,Yeah I might swing trade ARKK if dips around 110 again but buy and hold is asking for significant pain in the short to medium term imo.

2021-04-07 18:43:58,wallstreetbets,Yeah you gotta hold it open with the other hand and kind of look away from your finger. Easier to touch the white bit. Also more comfortable if you wet your finger with some water.
2021-04-07 19:33:54,wallstreetbets,I honestly dont know Im a NE hipster lol I jist saw they crushed earnings and were rated as undervalued
2021-04-07 19:27:45,wallstreetbets,"During the week I was digging for customer sentiment--no formal surveys or anything, just feeling around--and yeah, they're considered particularly good. Of note is their e-commerce because a lot of their ammo sales were made online, and new locations opening (particularly if they have ammo shipments) had lines going around the corner of the block. They're really quite popular, which would explain their stellar earnings for 2020."

2021-04-07 17:40:12,wallstreetbets,2apooky4me. Thanks for sharing lol! I need to smooth away my brain wrinkles anyway
2021-04-07 19:29:08,wallstreetbets,"The company is valued at around $2bil. They have $700mil in cash, one of the few ""speculative"" ev plays that has an actual approved and crash tested vehicle. Tons of real world driving tests and they already partnered with Roucsh so, its not a terrible bet. 

Also, they are below their SPAC offering price currently (was $10 when merged)"

2021-04-07 17:53:57,wallstreetbets,Looks pretty much like mine but your expiration dates are really close I at least have 6 more months of red colors on my VIAC calls and 2 more weeks to get it up in my ASO 🦄

2021-04-07 17:51:45,wallstreetbets,"I was looking at $RIDE a while ago, but this kind of DD is beyond my retardation. 

I like it."
2021-04-07 19:57:52,wallstreetbets,I love how the dummy’s who jumped on the hindentrash band wagon will lose money on their short positions.
2021-04-07 16:02:45,wallstreetbets,"Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

“When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a ‘pretty good game’.”

Anyone else notice how Cramer has been trying to induce FUD into retail investors and scare them out of American EV stocks? Meanwhile, we’re seeing the single greatest revolution in our country’s automotive industry since Henry Ford’s model T in 1908.

You want a “pretty good game,” Cramer? I will buy $RIDE stock until all of your Wall Street and Hedge Fund buddies close their short positions against American EV companies.

That sounds like a good “game” to me.

2021-04-07 17:05:07,wallstreetbets,Enough of your mention. Nothing happens when you post. Rally up your troops and make something happen. You people are too busy trading over expensive GME and AMC that is diluted like by a bazillion shares.

2021-04-07 19:27:12,wallstreetbets,"Full disclosure: I do not own, and am not short this stock.

This is financial advice, which I can give, because it's a free country and I don't control other people's money:

Do not purchase this stock.

The company will be bankrupt in 6 months. It will never produce this truck. If you look at the entry list for the San Felipe 250, you'll notice that the Lordstown ""truck"" which doesn't even have airbags installed in it is the only vehicle in the ""EV"" class. It will ""win"" this race, and you'll see press releases about that, assuming it can finish the race, which is doubtful since it appears to me at least that the driver of the vehicle is intended at this point to be a person just out of high school.

Lordstown claims they are going to be mass producing vehicles in the next 6 months. If you peruse their job board, you'll notice that they aren't hiring for vehicle manufacturing positions in their Lordstown, OH facility. If you compare their public jobs listings with those of say, CCIV (not saying you should buy CCIV), you'll notice that CCIV has an actual factory, and is hiring hundreds (if not thousands) of actual people to construct their vehicle.

I've seen now, several attempts at people attempting to produce DD to support this company and they never mention these things. They'll wiz you with MACD bullcrap and chart analysis on a company that was taken public virtually yesterday and has no history of stock trading. Technical analysis is useless here.

Common sense is useful: Are they hiring people to construct vehicles? If they are, they're doing it secretly. Are their vehicles capable of being licensed to operate on US roadways? Not from any of the video's I've seen on their own website.

TL:dr Maybe they can produce a vehicle. I'll be waiting to see before I give them money to hire ""corporate wellness directors"" ... an actual job listing on their website."
2021-04-07 16:35:33,wallstreetbets,TA don't mean shit when the fundamentals suck.

2021-04-07 18:20:37,wallstreetbets,"I agree that's what is holding it down, but that's why the phrase buy the fear exists anyways. This stock is priced as though the inquiry will prove disastrous for the company with huge repercussions. If that came true, what's the worst that can happen? It loses 50% of it's value and drops to 5 bucks? And if the inquiry turns out to just be a formality and nothing happens, then what? The stock heads back towards it's peak of 30 gaining almost 200% vs a possible drop of 50%. That's one hell of a reward vs risk if you ask me."

2021-04-07 18:08:04,wallstreetbets,Here's the Baja render on [Motortrend](https://www.motortrend.com/news/lordstown-endurance-ev-baja-racing-san-felipe-250/) so you can get an idea what a lift and bigger wheels would look like.  HOT.
2021-04-07 18:03:47,wallstreetbets,It's a nice truck! Enough horsepower to take my 600lb wife to cheesecake factory every weekend!
2021-04-07 16:54:27,wallstreetbets,"I live in the deep south and am friends with a lot of the new generation of redneck zoomers, the kind that drive lifted F150s but still know Tesla and might be willing to consider electric. I showed one of them the Cybertruck already, and when I recently showed him the Endurance he said ""That damn liberal truck you showed me before was ugly as hell, but that thing ain't half bad.""

For me that was enough to know, if Lordstown builds it, they will come."
2021-04-07 19:55:47,wallstreetbets,"52,500 before any electric vehicle tax credits. Jesus, that's a pretty price.

2021-04-07 16:21:07,wallstreetbets,"apparently not according to the SEC. until i see a prospect of a production line, i'm staying tf away from this. the prototype before the two Betas unveiled last week caught on fire. 

and, they wanna be in production by september? lm🌈🐻ao"
2021-04-07 18:28:43,wallstreetbets,"Imo, the safest bets would be LEAPS that expire well after production is supposed to start in September. But admittedly I only own OTM calls.

A lot of call volume is being seen around Apr 23rd, the week right after the race, but be careful not to get IV crushed by those."
2021-04-07 18:36:40,wallstreetbets,"End of April would be good, and then September"
2021-04-07 18:08:28,wallstreetbets,"I started buying in large quantities after the Hindenburg report. Look at the 6 month chart, it’s done this sell-off several times before and then bounced back to $30"
2021-04-07 18:32:18,wallstreetbets,"It blew my mind to see the amount of people on a short sellers lap for a few weeks, as though they released their report for the betterment of humanity. I have to just assume everyone I talked to about the stock wasn't around to screw the GME short sellers or they'd get that by now."
2021-04-07 19:32:56,wallstreetbets,"I didn't avoid them to pull the wool over your eyes or something, it would be beating a very dead horse to bring up, again, that yes the preorders are non binding and they have always been non binding, just like plenty of other companies do. Companies that made the preorders in question have come out in defense of Lordstown in response to the short report. But either way, if you don't think a market exists for a full size electric truck like the preorders show, then I don't know what to tell ya"

2021-04-07 16:22:29,wallstreetbets,"Bro I made so much money buying GME at $5 back then when no one believed. I’m still holding half of what I bought but paid off my student debt. 

The fraud is just the SEC trying to look like they actually give a shit. The Hindenburg will blow up just like he horrific original air disaster it’s named after.

2021-04-07 16:00:39,wallstreetbets,"I didn't delve deep into that here just because I feel that's been covered a lot already. But the SEC is essentially just looking into the claims made in the report by Hindenburg, a lot of which are just flat out wrong, primarily the claims that the preorders weren't disclosed as nonbinding originally (which they were).

A big difference here separating them from Nikola is, well, Nikola rolls down hills and Lordstown actually has functioning betas that just came out last week."
2021-04-07 16:06:54,wallstreetbets,"A short seller report from Hindenburg asserted that their non-binding pre orders are not real orders and that the truck is vaporware.  Since that report, Lordstown has rolled [betas off the line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6rjvmSCJA) that move under their own power, climb uphill, and their skateboard platform is being used in the SCORE Baja 250 race.  They have plans to produce betas every day until they have 50+ for testing. They have a factory, tooling, an assembly line, backing from GM and WKHS, a battery deal with LG, a licensed and proven motor design, executives from TSLA, GM, WKHS, ample cash on hand and a solid business plan.  They have all they need to accomplish their goal of rolling their first vehicles off the line in the Fall. 

Hindenburg's chief assertion is that the 100,000 pre-orders don't exist.  Basically, saying there's no demand for an electric pickup truck.  Does that even feel remotely true to you?"

2021-04-07 18:07:18,wallstreetbets,They did produced some. They have a video of it on their website but still not profitable. RIDE says they received many orders but Hindenburg says they're scam. That's why it did crashed hard 🤷‍♂️

2021-04-07 17:02:13,wallstreetbets,Pretty solid stance to take. I do see a ton of possible catalyst this year for that 20 push. There was just a article written about IV exploding for 4/21 calls . Same time Lordstown will be racing there truck in the baja race on tv
2021-04-07 17:42:15,wallstreetbets,"Meh .. not the sexiest truck imo but, hey, it's an EV so yay planet. I think fleets will gobble it up. As long as they don't spontaneously combust and the engine works these should print.

2021-04-07 16:09:58,wallstreetbets,"The big difference for me is none of the big corporate backers like GM have bailed, unlike with the Nikola situation. GM bailed quickly into the Nikola investigation.

I, to be straightforward, bailed from my original position when I heard the news. But then I did my own research and bought the dip. I believe in what they are doing and it’s going to make me good money too."
2021-04-07 17:38:51,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I do believe in Lordstown and that they are going to go somewhere. I drive past the factory every so often and there are cars in the lot from people working there, it's not like just an empty factory doing nothing. I like the trucks they want to build better than pretty much all of the competition. Like that it's fairly local, being from Ohio and not someplace like China or India. They seem to have a decent amount of partnerships and backing so I doubt they will be going anywhere before they start rolling out vehicles. Even if they somehow lost funding or backing, it seems like they would be a prime target to be bought out by or merged with another company

I bought a couple shares of $RIDE at the beginning of March then again in the middle of March. I have 12 shares at a cost basis of $16.67 per share. It has bothered me seeing the value in my shares go down by about $60 and that is a little disappointing. Hopefully it does turn around soon. I didn't buy the stock as some sort of get rich quick thing, figured it would be something I would hold onto and add more for a couple years or so. 

I'm not the best person to take advice from since I just started playing around with stocks earlier this year. I just have a couple thousand dollars in stocks and everything has basically evened out so far. Most I've picked have lost money (like RIDE), or stayed about the same, with the losses being offset by GME and AMC gains."
2021-04-07 17:02:34,wallstreetbets,"No, they’re saying there aren’t 100k pre-orders for Lordstown’s electric pickup truck. Not all electric pickups - TSLA’s cyber trucks has tons. Fraudulent pre-orders is not unbelievable in light of NKLA’s fraud, so yes."
2021-04-07 16:07:26,wallstreetbets,"If you buy after it’s resolved, and it will be you lose out on some seriously discounted stonks"
2021-04-07 16:08:53,wallstreetbets,"So we should wait til they’ve continued to show production capabilities beyond initial betas, wait til they produce concrete sales numbers, wait til there truck runs through the a 250 mile race track. 

Oh yeah, and I guess we should wait to invest until after the stock lands on the moon as well... makes sense now"

It is the 3rd most  productive plant in NORTH AMERICA.   A well trained eager workforce lives nearby because  the plant went quiet less than 2 years ago. 
 This full size pick up truck that actually  LOOKS LIKE A TRUCK,  is going  sell at least $20,000 less  than the next rival.  It will also have 172 service centers  IN IT'S  PARTNER CAMPING  WORLD. That is way more than TESLA  or any  other competition.   They will be able to MASS PRODUCE  ( 1st mover advantage) before anyone else.  It's on fire sale now at 33% of ATH.

2021-04-07 18:42:23,wallstreetbets,"Good question. I hate to keep pointing to Tesla, but in such a new industry it's hard to point to any other relevant examples. In Tesla's case, first mover advantage was huge. If we sort by EV sales in 2018 [here](https://evadoption.com/ev-sales/evs-percent-of-vehicle-sales-by-brand/), we can see that Tesla sold 5X more electric vehicles than even the closest runner up, Chevy. Let's recall that Tesla wasn't a huge name back then, they just made it to the market first.

Sure, Ford, Chevy, Dodge, etc. will all undoubtedly release fully electric versions of their trucks eventually, but if Lordstown beats them to market like they plan to, where will they already be by then? That's your bet to make."

2021-04-07 18:56:58,wallstreetbets,Good points. My intentions were not to downplay the GM plant. They are way better positioned than shorts would have you believe

I had money in ride.  It took it out at a lose and the price has gone down since then.

That being said GMs stock is to high to make money.  give me a reason to believe  and I might."
2021-04-07 18:53:22,wallstreetbets,No it wasn't. The media and shorts made it into a big thing... realistically these guys have so many people who want trucks that they won't be able to make them fast enough. That's the bottom line.
2021-04-07 19:07:27,wallstreetbets,"I’d like to know what you meAn? How you know that?

2021-04-07 19:58:33,wallstreetbets,Twopoor’s comment is a scam.

2021-04-07 19:18:40,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Hedge funds play psychology with retailers like us. Intel doesn't perform as well as AMD but share price keep inching upwards. AMD should rocket after their last earnings. But price was artificially pushed down.
2021-04-07 17:49:24,wallstreetbets,Price is about right. Might buy some underlying and/or sell some puts tomm.

2021-04-07 16:03:46,wallstreetbets,So if I don’t trade on margin I’m good?
2021-04-07 18:09:23,wallstreetbets,How Is the third example a day trade of I owned 50 shares already? If I didn't increase my position - I was still able to close 50 shares. Especially if closing positions (as mentioned in the last example) is ordered by time of execution?
2021-04-07 18:21:20,wallstreetbets,"I read that they will clear your PDT restriction once every 90 days, so I went over my limit. Turns out they just flat out say no, even though technically it's possible. So now I'm screwed on my account for 90 days."
2021-04-07 18:24:21,wallstreetbets,this is why i have 3 different accounts 9 trades a week
2021-04-07 19:31:10,wallstreetbets,"In response to the last couple of points, ""round trip"" trades are usually only 1 day trade. This is subject to broker rules, but multiple entries and 1 exit/1 entry multiple exits should not count as multiple day trades.

Tip #3 from: investorsunderground.com/pattern-day-trader-rule/

>It’s a reminder that the PDT rule restricts *round trip* trades. A round trip is where you buy and sell in the same day.  
>  
>Under this rule, you can still have multiple entries with one exit or multiple exits from one entry. For example, you could buy three lots of 200 shares, and sell 600 shares to exit the trade or vice versa. This can be effective for traders who feel pressured to go “all in” in fear of wasting a day trade.  
>  
>***Important Note: Different brokers may have different definitions of ""round trips."" Make sure to check with your broker before utilizing this strategy. Some brokers allow one entry with multiple exits while others allow multiple entries with one exit.***"

""One major plus side to cash accounts is you can day trade all you want as long as you have settled funds and won’t be held to the [pattern day trading](https://www.warriortrading.com/pattern-day-trader-rule/) rules in a margin account.

There is also no [equity](https://www.warriortrading.com/equity-definition-day-trading-terminology/) requirement to day trade in a cash account, which is a huge bonus for traders who don’t have the extra $25,000 lying around.""

2021-04-07 17:14:01,wallstreetbets,"From the link in the text you quoted:

“Essentially, if you have a $5,000 account, you can only make three-day trades in any rolling five-day period. Once your account value is above $25,000, the restriction no longer applies to you.”

This is literally the SECs day trading rule. In this case you’re covering the margin requirement in cash..."

2021-04-07 17:49:35,wallstreetbets,"Agree. You can BUY with unsettled funds but cannot trade until they clear/settle. For options, that’s one day. For stocks, that’s 2 days."
2021-04-07 19:57:52,wallstreetbets,*IF* it's a margin account. What happened to the wsb'ers who had a clue.
2021-04-07 18:31:11,wallstreetbets,Yeah that’s been my experience. The fact you can buy with unsettled funds is bonkers though. Even with the rule that you can’t sell until the funds settle.

If the hedge funds drive the price down before this happens, people will be even more likely to buy more shares. I doubt they're going to want the price at a low level at that time, keeping it high might discourage some new buyers."

2021-04-07 17:13:13,wallstreetbets,They were saying this same thing to DFV a year ago
2021-04-07 16:59:33,wallstreetbets,G'luck & pls post updates.
2021-04-07 19:55:19,wallstreetbets,People are quick to forget.
2021-04-07 19:52:02,wallstreetbets,This but unironically.  Don't trust people who use bold too
2021-04-07 17:54:31,wallstreetbets,No i dea lmao
2021-04-07 19:21:25,wallstreetbets,the stock market is just one big bukakke
2021-04-07 18:32:42,wallstreetbets,IT’S IN MY FACE
2021-04-07 18:57:37,wallstreetbets,$12
2021-04-07 19:19:05,wallstreetbets,So deep itm that they're basically shares. Pretty safe bet that he'll just exercise them if the price stays flat.
2021-04-07 18:23:23,wallstreetbets,"Oh I don't think he'll be OTM at all. But if the overall stock price drives down, his contacts values will drive down. Or he'll excise them and just hold the shares I guess. He does like the stock."
2021-04-07 18:48:43,wallstreetbets,"Nope. It's a $12 strike. So he will be able to exercise his 500 contracts for 50,000 shares at $12. 

It will cost him $600k to make an immediate $8.4 mil profit. (Avg of $180 per share).

What

The

Shit"
2021-04-07 18:03:03,wallstreetbets,I think it’s just normal crying.
2021-04-07 17:08:31,wallstreetbets,"IV is calculated after a sale, not before.  MM'S raising the ask and getting it would cause IV to rises, not the other way around."
2021-04-07 16:54:02,wallstreetbets,GME has been flat for like 2 weeks this is the bottom for IV
2021-04-07 16:38:22,wallstreetbets,"It's GME, iv would never crash"
2021-04-07 18:48:40,wallstreetbets,Ask urself who sets the price of IV
2021-04-07 18:36:26,wallstreetbets,Basically the downward movement in price led to upward movement in IV (ie more uncertainty about its future price). Higher IV results in higher option prices
2021-04-07 17:41:11,wallstreetbets,What the fuck is an option?
2021-04-07 17:50:50,wallstreetbets,"Out of the money (OTM) call options should decrease in price as their time to expiry lessens because the decreased chance that the call will finish ""In the money"". That's theta decay.

The 4/16 800c should have decreased today given the aforementioned theta decay and delta decay which occurs when the price of the underlying security drops."
2021-04-07 18:02:42,wallstreetbets,"Starting at the $270 strike all the options there and above went up today, some more than 20%"
2021-04-07 18:02:36,wallstreetbets,"All the otm calls recovered morning losses and then some. Not just 800c. I think the point is that if ANY of these strikes lost money, surely it would be the far otm."

2021-04-07 17:04:09,wallstreetbets,"I was under the impression that call prices were going lower because GMEs volatility is more stabilized.

I have only basic knowledge about options so no actual idea what I'm speaking."
2021-04-07 17:54:47,wallstreetbets,Can’t it be that only the spread will just be very large? Meaning that bid will stay the same/be lower and only ask will rise? Just guessing ..
2021-04-07 19:56:23,wallstreetbets,Have no clue why the 270 goes green
2021-04-07 17:37:28,wallstreetbets,I take it you're also taking a 800C 4/16 position?
2021-04-07 17:57:26,wallstreetbets,"My $1.5p is at 1,045% iv right now."
2021-04-07 19:19:10,wallstreetbets,I can close my eyes and see his YOLO post in my head 🤤 fucking LEGEND
2021-04-07 19:48:25,wallstreetbets,He'll exercise them if the price skyrockets just further the point
2021-04-07 19:21:57,wallstreetbets,Yea I’d bet he’s gonna exercise. He’s got more than enough cash to cover the cost of exercising
2021-04-07 17:10:36,wallstreetbets,"It’s had like 3+ wks flat before feb pop I believe. I hope you’re right because I’ve got a grip on the line too. My worry is that MM know we will all buy based on previous patterns... so they might be able to set us up somehow and fuck us. I’m not smart enough to be able to guess on how, but I wouldn’t put it past them at all."
2021-04-07 18:54:40,wallstreetbets,The math gods 🤷‍♂️
2021-04-07 19:37:18,wallstreetbets,Happy cake day :)
2021-04-07 19:07:47,wallstreetbets,I'm guessing it also has to do with technical analysis presenting signals of an upcoming price swing. Also guessing that more people are just looking to buy those options right now expecting a dip rebound and are willing to pay the premium?
2021-04-07 18:55:09,wallstreetbets,Gotcha
2021-04-07 18:00:25,wallstreetbets,"An option is when your wife tells you, you can decide between sleeping on the couch or on the floor because the bed is full from her and her boyfriend."
2021-04-07 17:55:14,wallstreetbets,The fact that IV made up for theta and delta crush for a 400% otm call expiring in 7 biz days or whatever my god
2021-04-07 19:07:30,wallstreetbets,how do you track that historical price movement for the options chain?

2021-04-07 18:04:10,wallstreetbets,"28k oi on april 16 800c, bid/ask has been 2 or 3 cents from what i can tell throughout day. Calls theoughout the entire chain went up today"
2021-04-07 17:50:03,wallstreetbets,Nah. Just 20k in shares.

2021-04-07 18:50:46,wallstreetbets,Best part is those options don't cost a damn thing
2021-04-07 18:05:31,wallstreetbets,How many would have had to have been bought for that to happen???
2021-04-07 19:09:55,wallstreetbets,"Just looked on TDA up the chain for 4-16, and it went red to green at 270"

2021-04-07 18:28:04,wallstreetbets,Yahoo Finance has IV listed from 154%-300% between ATM-OTM options with it really only changing when near deep ITM calls or deep OTM puts like the $5-$15 strike price range. That guy is full of shite.
2021-04-07 18:09:39,wallstreetbets,"Who cares, it was enough = MM on last thread. Uppies next. Maybe who knows lmao ive placed my bet"
2021-04-07 18:36:24,wallstreetbets,"it is the deep OTM options that went up anomalously, all of the ITM options decreased in premium"

2021-04-07 17:15:41,wallstreetbets,I was about to buy TLRY stock but then I got high
2021-04-07 18:54:28,wallstreetbets,"You forgot... once merges, will be largest marijuana company in the world... 😉"
2021-04-07 15:24:25,wallstreetbets,"You missed the most important catalyst. Stifel lowered earnings expectations, and then raised their target. They are trying to get a lower entry point before earnings, which should cause the stock to go up.

Another overlooked point: TLRY is incorporated in the US, so once weed is legalized in the US they can begin operation here, even without acknowledging sweetwater."
2021-04-07 15:19:48,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-04-07 19:04:25,wallstreetbets,Gogo weed gang. Got over 500 apha shares. Believe in the weed!
2021-04-07 19:08:02,wallstreetbets,Now is the best time to get into TLRY. This thing can skyrocket from 20 to 30 in days on a bit of good news. MJ is a good long term bet IMO.
2021-04-07 16:02:17,wallstreetbets,In for the ride just because i believe retards will buy the shit on this for 420 meme
2021-04-07 15:19:17,wallstreetbets,APHA earnings on 4/12.
2021-04-07 15:54:19,wallstreetbets,So will my APHA shares become TLRY shares after the merger? My brain is too smooth to understand
2021-04-07 15:22:20,wallstreetbets,How would options be effected by the merger? Lets say I have options on apha expiring on 5/14
2021-04-07 19:18:10,wallstreetbets,Why on earth wouldn’t they wait to report earnings until 4/20? 🤪
2021-04-07 19:36:23,wallstreetbets,TLRY 💰 👄
2021-04-07 16:11:46,wallstreetbets,Hehe

2021-04-07 18:29:15,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-04-07 16:56:57,wallstreetbets,I thought they couldn't operate in the US. Still holding APHA tough
2021-04-07 16:09:40,wallstreetbets,Hell yea brother
2021-04-07 16:00:26,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you will receive 0.8381 TLRY shares for every APHA share you own."

2021-04-07 15:25:46,wallstreetbets,This is a casino
2021-04-07 18:48:12,wallstreetbets,"Since you used the words ""optimal"", ""build"" and ""invest"" then I'd recommend some paper trading to get a feel for this shit and a detour over to r/thetagang. Or buy 2 of a bunch of stocks you think seem good and then watch what happens to your head when they go south and when they spike. How bad do you want to sell on a dump? How hot the fomo burn? Are you willing to take profit?

Lots of ways to trade, including investing. You're gonna have to figure out which one you are built/wired for.

If you have 5k seed money and this is your first dip, then that 5k is tuition. Whatever you do, make sure as shit that it buys you some solid edu so that you have an idea what you want to do with the next 5 when this 5 runs out.

Homey already replied reminding you that this, sir, is a casino. He ain't kidding. There's solid DD in here if you're into scrolling and reading a ton. There's also a ton of CB. These two are not the same. DD let's you fuk, CB gets you fuk.

Or just buy 5k worth of FDs on something retarded and if you win come back in here and show us that epic gain porn."
2021-04-07 15:25:16,wallstreetbets,YOLO SPY puts
2021-04-07 15:57:53,wallstreetbets,I downloaded an app called free trade to start off because a friend had it and said if I joined I got a free stock. It was an interesting decision.. haven’t technically lost anything yet because I haven’t sold any shares but I’ve had a few shaky moments and actually.. I did lose something like £6 on Roblox stocks because I panikd and sold too early - idk what my original point was anymore
2021-04-07 17:05:18,wallstreetbets,"They don't have the licenses to operate in the US, likely because of patchwork legalization and banking laws, it isn't worth the effort. Being a US headquartered company makes it easy to get those licenses though."
2021-04-07 16:17:59,wallstreetbets,"Why would you buy TLRY, if it is cheaper and you get more on APHA at the .8381/1 ratio. Looking at current market rate?"
2021-04-07 16:26:20,wallstreetbets,But the options will still stay open ?
2021-04-07 15:33:45,wallstreetbets,"Are you telling me to educate myself before investing or is that a stock or something? Lol

Part of me doing my own due diligence is asking for advice as a starting point."

2021-04-07 16:20:41,wallstreetbets,"APHA is currently trading at pretty close to 0.8381 of TLRY price, so it doesn't really matter which you buy.

This close to merger, they will track each other pretty well."
2021-04-07 17:05:54,wallstreetbets,"Yes, they just become non-standard options."
2021-04-07 15:51:39,wallstreetbets,"Sink it all into VTI and transfer it to me

Just kidding, buy the deepest OTM calls you can with the soonest expiration, and then sell them as soon as they make you nervous."
2021-04-07 17:28:00,wallstreetbets,Don't buy options till you have AT LEAST doubled your money. That's all I have to say on that.

2021-04-07 18:33:20,wallstreetbets,"Turns out contributions to a standard IRA are tax deductible but contributions to a Roth IRA are not. So for you, it isn't. If I opened a Roth I could contribute 12k after tax and then it wouldn't be taxed later. A standard IRA will be tased later because it isn't taxed up front."
2021-04-07 18:27:40,wallstreetbets,"Hm. I thought making a contribution to an IRA was tax deductible. I've had ""simple"" tax returns until this year so when I say the following I actually mean it: IDKWTF I'm doing. Gonna have to hire my taxes this year for sure, but I already submitted mine for last year, and so I was avoiding making a contribution to the IRA for 2020 to avoid having to refile"
2021-04-07 18:35:48,wallstreetbets,"sounds right.  for something like full GME holdings, I'd rather buy using post-tax dollars (roth) and not pay taxes on the tail end (assuming price goes up), rather than using pre-tax dollars now with a tax deduction (traditional) then paying tax when I withdraw."
2021-04-07 18:36:10,wallstreetbets,"Making a Roth contribution isn’t tax deductible, making a traditional IRA contribution, is but only if you make under $76,000 per year (modified AGI)."
2021-04-07 19:39:40,wallstreetbets,"Basically Roth if you think you’ll be wealthier later down the road when you start getting retirement (marginal tax rate would be higher, bad)"
2021-04-07 18:43:11,wallstreetbets,"I should have opened a Roth and had a traditional IRA and a Roth but instead I have a traditional and a normal brokerage account. And if I were to sell my shares, move the money to a Roth then I'd have to pay the capitol gains on it this year. 

Also Roths are only tax free after age 65 so

2021-04-07 15:17:32,wallstreetbets,"Most just happen to break the rules.

Same with most GME posts but there are a lot more of them so more tend to make it through.

Although this one technically breaks a rule too, so we'll see."
2021-04-07 16:21:33,wallstreetbets,To be fair previous Gamestop leadership was terrible as well.
2021-04-07 15:58:34,wallstreetbets,Nope not concerned
2021-04-07 16:29:34,wallstreetbets,Nope
2021-04-07 15:27:59,wallstreetbets,Yeah I know some break the rules but I've seen legit yolo's and losses get taken down fast. It was worse back when the rally first started but it still happens daily.

2021-04-07 14:37:27,wallstreetbets,I can’t read their menu is too big
2021-04-07 14:40:19,wallstreetbets,Cracker Barrel is packed all the time now. Ppl done with washing dishes.
2021-04-07 14:58:25,wallstreetbets,No. No. No fucking way. It’s at an ALL TIME HIGH. I don’t think it’s actually growing. Who the fuck goes to cheesecake?

2021-04-07 14:43:17,wallstreetbets,What about 🦍 do they like Cheesecake Factory?
2021-04-07 15:05:12,wallstreetbets,"honestly in the restaurant space, I don't really see the point in buying one of these companies that can't be sold rn/in the near future. (IMO) no one is buying out cheesecake factory at a valuation of 13 million dollars per location. there's so many other distressed/semi beat down restaurants that I'd imagine can be targeted by the goliath sized pocket books. I'd rather try to find one of those c+ QSR's that yum brands is gonna try to gobble up to keep their mediocrity-hegemony intact."
2021-04-07 15:18:07,wallstreetbets,$15 to $60 since March 2020.   Already a 4X move.   Not for me.   Odds favor a larger pullback before advancing again.  It backs up to the mid $40's and I might be interested.

Cake is a great idea to invest in, but not at its current price. If it dips a bit I’ll bite"

2021-04-07 17:19:45,wallstreetbets,"Thanks to the first post I bought puts on PLUG and made out like a bandit with 87% profit today. You guys saved my ass, the rest of my portfolio took a massive dump.

Tried buying calls on Nee but it was shooting up and couldn't get a bite.

Gonna grab some calls on FCEL and possibly SPWR. Might also grab some more puts on PLUG.

But why PCG? Am I missing something with them being in clean energy?"
2021-04-07 14:34:43,wallstreetbets,u/AllDatDalton u/sublette313   Where are your thoughts on CHPT? Curious.

2021-04-07 15:05:59,wallstreetbets,I meannnnnn they’re printing pretty hard so it could bounce soon but if you got time on the expiry I’d hold
2021-04-07 15:07:05,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that's what I'm thinking, but they don't expire until 4/30 

ugh"
2021-04-07 19:25:04,wallstreetbets,"Take it for what it's worth but there was a ton of call activity on plug weeklies today, specifically the 34c and 35c."
2021-04-07 17:49:26,wallstreetbets,Just to clarify: at this point I see PSFE as a rare value/growth stock buy opportunity. Very limited downside compared to upside. Low risk/high reward. Call it what you want. I’m in it for the long term.
2021-04-07 16:57:31,wallstreetbets,What's the next catalyst?
2021-04-07 19:25:42,wallstreetbets,I see long text with good words I buy stock
2021-04-07 14:11:57,wallstreetbets,"Hey friend I'm with you. I've only got 36 at 13-something but I plan to add throughout the year. I'm thinking 10x in a couple years.

Seems to be the problem with most SPACs."
2021-04-07 16:09:27,wallstreetbets,Smart minds think alike! SO undervalued! Here’s my [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mltjdf/paysafe_the_biggest_fintech_youve_never_heard_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) from yesterday.
2021-04-07 14:35:14,wallstreetbets,We need to get this to the whole audience
2021-04-07 14:26:12,wallstreetbets,"This is embarrassing. I’ve started accumulating some PSFE but you’re completely wrong about some easily searchable information. It is not “Bill Foley’s Blackstone.” Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private in 2017. It was already “under the wings” of Blackstone. This year they went public through a merger with Bill Foley’s SPAC, BFT, which just changed its ticker to PSFE."
2021-04-07 14:13:33,wallstreetbets,Interesting take! Thanks for the info.
2021-04-07 16:13:00,wallstreetbets,"Nice DD. As a PSFE bagholder, I'm waiting for that one GREAT DD to gild gold to. Yours is nice but not great, unfortunately..."
2021-04-07 15:40:26,wallstreetbets,Lots of shorting going on. Maybe upset over a merger compared to a more pricey IPO? I'm in.
2021-04-07 19:42:51,wallstreetbets,"Wasn't this posted a few days ago pretty much exactly like this?

2021-04-07 16:45:19,wallstreetbets,You will lose money if you touch paysafe. Don’t do it.
2021-04-07 17:08:44,wallstreetbets,"Analysts and media will start to cover sooner or later, the merger is still very fresh so probably when the financials are in place. Q1 results around the corner. Many potential near-term catalysts"
2021-04-07 14:28:57,wallstreetbets,In that case I think it would make more sense for PYPL or SQ to try and acquire PSFE. Their footprint is simply too big.
2021-04-07 14:50:39,wallstreetbets,"This is not just another SPAC. Paysafe has got intrinsic value and the investors know what they went into unlike some of the hit-and-run SPACs that have been coming up lately.

The lockup expires July for the biggest investors Blackstone/CVC at earliest. PIPE has no lockup as far as I know.

The wide consensus seems to be that the stock is heavily underpriced, so I'm not worried to be honest."

2021-04-07 16:33:02,wallstreetbets,I'll have one in the next week or so. I'm a software engineer in the fintech industry and paysafe has the market cornered in a few areas that are going to be hard for other companies to catch up due to regulations and footprint
2021-04-07 17:01:18,wallstreetbets,"Thank you. There’s absolutely more to be said, these were some quick thoughts and I hope it inspires more people to do their own DDs and share them with us! Fair to say, I like the stock."
2021-04-07 15:57:12,wallstreetbets,I think it’s more to do with hedge funds shorting SPACs as a whole. Beauty of the shorts are if it moves you get a nice gamma squeeze to maximize gains.
2021-04-07 16:55:59,wallstreetbets,How do you find the data on how much a stock is short?
2021-04-07 14:57:32,wallstreetbets,PSFE makes money though

IV is so low right now that even a small bull run for a few days anytime in the next 2-3 months is going to put the October calls through the roof

I don't think the October $20c are bad but the bang for my buck on the $15c after a few more flat days just makes more sense imo"
2021-04-07 17:09:40,wallstreetbets,Did you buy the top?

2021-04-07 19:34:59,wallstreetbets,"All just my opinion but If what you say is true, you should sell and count yourself lucky that you went all in and made 456% profit.  I’m not trying to be rude; a lot of people got swept up in this retail trend and have not been so lucky.  You should sell everything and then reinvest your initial $600 and put your gains back in your savings account."

Of course things could go great, but chances are, it won't. It sucks that things are not great out there, and it may seem like there aren't any options (heh). But PLEASE take the criticism with some thought. Should you really even be spending your time here if your financial situation is so dismal? Could there possibly be something else that you can spend your time on other than a hobby that is almost guaranteed to lose you money?"
2021-04-07 15:21:00,wallstreetbets,Fuck that guy. Just goes to show someone will always be crabby about your successes. Nice gains

2021-04-07 14:18:43,wallstreetbets,Lol! That was pretty funny. I bet the stats are wrong though - it might have been weighting new things or something
2021-04-07 14:20:15,wallstreetbets,Maybe idk lol it is only the latest 1k comments and I mostly only post in our private clubhouse nowadays
2021-04-07 14:22:55,wallstreetbets,Yeah and you typed my name a lot that weekend from stats because I kept asking for new shit lol
2021-04-07 14:24:23,wallstreetbets,90% of my portfolio is in APHA/TLRY. Next few months should be good
2021-04-07 14:15:20,wallstreetbets,"It’s okay brother! I’m down 13% on 25 shares!

But it’s okay! The Merger on April 16th will set TLRY up to be the most efficient cannabis company with license across the EU and Canada. They’ve secured a strong foothold in the EU Market, and just waiting to attack the American Market

This seems like a $100 stock!!! At this price I’ll be buying more !!!! :) not financial advise please do DD like I have. But I believe 💎🤲🏻"
2021-04-07 18:54:06,wallstreetbets,"This is a long term winner IMO. Biggest dog in the game. Every day we move closer and closer to legalization and widespread adoption. 

Diamond hands baby."
2021-04-07 14:02:48,wallstreetbets,It seems to be down due to the expected net revenue loss on Aphiras side. But its still a long game considering once the merger is done they will be the biggest MJ company publicly traded. Any clues on when the actual merger is supposed to happen? I know its already confirmed and rules set for it just not sure on the date.
2021-04-07 14:31:17,wallstreetbets,🚀💎🤲🏻
2021-04-07 15:33:31,wallstreetbets,The shareholder vote for the merger is April 16th.  The actual merger doesn't have a date yet.
2021-04-07 15:04:14,wallstreetbets,I believe
2021-04-07 14:09:12,wallstreetbets,16.4.2021
2021-04-07 15:06:20,wallstreetbets,"Assuming the company to company stuff gets finished pretty quickly after next week's votes, I'd say it'll take till June at least to get regulatory approvals in all the different jurisdictions (countries) they operate in. Aphria in particular, doesn't want to file its annual report until after the merger, so I'd say July at the latest."
2021-04-07 15:41:57,wallstreetbets,"But the 16th is when we start getting information on the merger. If things go well, many people will be wanting to buy TLRY and the price will get a good jump. 💎🤲🏻"
2021-04-07 14:10:08,wallstreetbets,Thanks! 💪🏻
2021-04-07 15:32:38,wallstreetbets,"That's the date of the shareholder vote, not the actual merger."
2021-04-07 17:24:56,wallstreetbets,"I've been investing in APHA + TLRY for years, so I hope it goes up!  However, I don't think they have a chance in the US market.  There's already several very well established US companies that are ready to go and selling in multiple states.  I don't see how Tilray can get into the US market in any major way unless US allows importing of Canadian products, and even then they have a huge battle against the already established US companies.

That said, APHA is still one of my largest positions and I'm still buying more.  But, I'm also buying into the big US companies too."

2021-04-07 15:44:06,wallstreetbets,I see you haven't seen people writing naked options

2021-04-07 14:51:19,wallstreetbets,Maybe you both did?
2021-04-07 16:42:07,wallstreetbets,Sometimes selling options do move against you but if the company is solid then you’ll hopefully recover by running the wheel or just waiting it out. Or buy and hold like a boring boomer.
2021-04-07 16:36:16,wallstreetbets,Tell truth I avoid the fancy stuff....equities long is the game for me. My coward heart keeps the shirt on my back.
2021-04-07 16:33:12,wallstreetbets,I mean it works until it doesn’t. I don’t feel bad for people losing their shirt writing naked options. They know the potential risks.
2021-04-07 15:01:14,wallstreetbets,"For sure, I was only a very small portion of those calls he screenshotted. But I thank him for his service"
2021-04-07 16:49:01,wallstreetbets,"But, if you sell a put  - to get in low...(Or just make money there.)

Then, sell a covered call(s) at a strike price higher than you entered at(Looking at you, SNDL)... With the premiums you collect and selling above the price you got in if you get assigned your covered call...

Isn't that a 0 risk strategy?~

As a bonus, SNDL calls have to be bought at $5 minimum due to the stock price - At least on the platforms I use.(WeBull/Robinhood.)

AmIRight???

2021-04-07 18:27:41,wallstreetbets,I sold 100 contracts so 👀
2021-04-07 17:10:51,wallstreetbets,"In a perfect world, Yeah.

However, if you're me, the underlying keeps plummeting past your put price after you're assigned. Then you wait a week to sell a covered call because your strike price pays like .11 because it's so far away and the underlying keeps falling. So then you panic and sell a covered call a few bucks under your buy-in price because you just want a few sheckles to start working yourself out of the hole you dug yourself into and the stock has shown no signs of at least trading sideways, let alone go up. And lo-and-be-hold if thats not the week the mother fucker moons and you just get to watch your baby taking off in all green and you don't get any of the profits. 

MARA."
2021-04-07 18:08:52,wallstreetbets,Or wait til the stock is trading at 50 cents s share and just buy the boring ass shares instead of options. You get the delta of deep itm calls: 1.0 without any theta decay to worry over.

We rented a screen for 4 people two weeks ago at our AMC.  Yesterday, my wife and I returned for Godzilla vs Kong.  
WE MISS THE MOVIES. This stock was highly undervalued, and many of my shares were bought in at sub $5.

2021-04-07 13:36:25,wallstreetbets,That’s so weird. To resize the numbers like that in row 1 would take a ton more work to code that way. Wtf.
2021-04-07 13:46:15,wallstreetbets,"sorry op. I just like to clarify when I report so other people know and stuff and you know someone reported and mods agree. It’ll save you confusion.

Obviously they’ll ignore the report and leave it if they agree it’s legit. I just wanted a second opinion on how weird it looks because I think you photoshopped it.

FYI, It’s hard to believe someone would put this much money in the market and still talk like a 9 year old, also. Y’all that hang out in the GME thread too long look more sus because your used to using bot speech. 

If you didn’t do the “I love the stonk!” I wouldn’t have looks closely."

2021-04-07 13:42:06,wallstreetbets,Yeah to code that kind of responsive shrinking of text like that is hard. I doubt the app would stay this shitty if they coded that in. Lol

2021-04-07 14:13:16,wallstreetbets,I'm right there with you!  I'm technically doing better at a cost basis of $9.50... but that's still very red.
2021-04-07 17:31:25,wallstreetbets,UWMC leaps are cheap AF. Once I get a good exit point on my 400 ROOT shares I’m going all in UWMC.
2021-04-07 14:26:45,wallstreetbets,I’m hoping UWMC will see some upward movement in early May from their earnings & inclusion in the Russell indices. 🤞
2021-04-07 13:20:00,wallstreetbets,I have about 20 shares. I have the feeling I'll be 💎🙌 this for awhile.
2021-04-07 14:07:28,wallstreetbets,520 shares here. Ready for some green...
2021-04-07 16:21:29,wallstreetbets,At under $8 is it still meme status?

2021-04-07 14:33:30,wallstreetbets,Only good about this stock are the dividens - they gave me 4 bucks on 400dll / ive seen others get 1200....gluck due
2021-04-07 14:55:49,wallstreetbets,"My cost basis for this stock is only $8.22. I'm might try some May $11 covered calls to lower my cost basis and if they get exercised, well then that's OK. I think the run up to earnings will be good but the guidance will probably erase whatever gains the anticipation leads to."

2021-04-07 13:58:17,wallstreetbets,Already made back more than 10% in 3 hours! 💪 I'll keep the 800 shares of UWMC Just in case but i don't believe in the stock in the short term.
2021-04-07 13:22:26,wallstreetbets,gave you an award bb <3 hope you find a way to get money
2021-04-07 13:21:28,wallstreetbets,Again I’m sorry you don’t have money
2021-04-07 14:11:39,wallstreetbets,"well if you want my legitimate opinion...

""rates rise"" this needs way more context and grounding. for those of us that were alive before the 90s, we remember days when 9-10% was a great mortgage rate. I don't see rates going above 3% anytime soon and long-term I think they stay at near-zero, particularly for qualified buyers. money is not hard to buy anymore for qualified debtors. it has been incredibly cheap for a decade now, I highly doubt that cycle breaks in my lifetime barring the complete collapse of the US dollar.

so I contest that the cost of borrowing money will remain insanely cheap for the upper-middle class for years/decades to come. the difference between a sub 2 rate and a sub 3 rate is not significant to me. I'll care when we get closer to 10

Real Estate will _forever_ be the most tax-advantaged asset class in the US. I hope simpletons understand this by now.

Combine these with the realisms of buying/selling homes today. There has been a multi-year shift away from conglomerate lenders because:

1. they take way longer to close deals

2. they don't actually _know_ values of a locale because they send appraisers from bumblefuck, USA

3. they don't give a fuck about relationships and do not compete on price when compared to local lenders/brokers

3 is why the legacy lending model of bulge bracket banks is no longer sustainable

2 is why consumers shift to local brokers

1 is why UWM is competitively MAGNITUDES ahead of competitors. They can close in less than 2 weeks

UWM also has the hard numbers/earnings to back up their growth and product demand. The market hasn't necessarily caught up with this (see the 6x earnings multiple) but I can wait that out easily. 

Unlike you retards, I am a functioning adult with a career that understands the industries I pick. I'm not worried at all

e: oh I totally forgot the incredible amount of churn subsequent to the urban exodus already taking place. the housing market has never been hotter than it is today"
2021-04-07 14:20:38,wallstreetbets,Is TDA still making you call in to buy GME options?
2021-04-07 16:19:39,wallstreetbets,"$100 strike lmfao. This is the safest ""bet"" I've ever seen on this sub, must've been a nasty premium for such an ultra-safe bet. On 04/16 too which is when DFV is exercising like 5000 shares IIRC?

Edit: I'm retarded and that layout is confusing, def thought it said 100C, leaving evidence of my stupidity up."

2021-04-07 15:55:08,wallstreetbets,well today i’m at 40 with an average of 135 - would’ve had more but decided to diversify and bought into $AMC at $10 (2 stonks is considered diversified right?) now maybe if i’m lucky that will drop to $1 like the suits at Loop Capital state and i can buy more on that dip lol...or i guess i could just sell and be a true retard.

2021-04-07 16:27:38,wallstreetbets,The amount of money they are going to lose seems to fit the sub canon though :)
2021-04-07 14:04:34,wallstreetbets,"Some good things going for it. Format is nice and clean. Can buy stocks in multiple markets. They submit your tax bill directly to the government. 

But yeah the hefty commissions are the big drawback. They apparently didn’t get the memo on commission free trading from the US brokers."
2021-04-07 16:36:30,wallstreetbets,I diversified as well. I’m YOLO’d in GME and AMC.
2021-04-07 15:47:37,wallstreetbets,so cool so now u must have more than enough to jump back in and help us new 🦍’s or did u already spend it on all those delicious tendies...just curious.

2021-04-07 16:31:44,wallstreetbets,Yeah can't fault that
2021-04-07 18:25:03,wallstreetbets,"The broker isn't the one that submits your tax form for you, its the account type ISK, which you can open up with any broker or bank.

Commissions are not big at all? It's 0.25%, and it's definitely worth it. Customer service is great and they're super legit. Not like the commissions free trading platforms in the US have gotten the best rap lately. It's become very clear what commissions free really means"
2021-04-07 14:06:19,wallstreetbets,Well nothing is free anyways. Probably saves y’all money in the long run because it makes you think twice about the play you’re getting into.
2021-04-07 19:36:35,wallstreetbets,"Honestly GME is volatile enough that commissions shouldn't be a major factor in your total P&L, anyway"
2021-04-07 19:50:56,wallstreetbets,"Yeah...I did. Bag holders don’t make money silly, so we sell when they’re up"
2021-04-07 14:14:15,wallstreetbets,I know someone that would give you hummer for $5

2021-04-07 17:05:24,wallstreetbets,AMC has nothing to do with fundamentals. The management is terrible and looks like they only care about milking the cow until it gets put out to pasture. It’s like a private equity firm has already bought them out. It’s solely a short squeeze play. So when/ if it goes off it will be fast and furious as people bail with modest gains.

I don't get it but I'll still leave my money there.

2021-04-07 12:46:20,wallstreetbets,"Probably not. $AMC is a shit company, it’ll probably also see a large short squeeze in the near future at the same time as $GME, but it’s still a shit company. $GME has a much brighter future ahead of it, short squeeze or no short squeeze."

2021-04-07 12:59:15,wallstreetbets,Must be really hard not to give yourself bonuses in these trying times.
2021-04-07 15:53:35,wallstreetbets,"Look at their P&L the last 3 years. Even the last 5 years- Covid obviously impacted their industry, but they have been running negative for so long. It's a dying industry- instead of being proactive and doing the bare minimum of closing your worse cinemas, they give a bonus to the CEO equivalent to what some of their worse cinemas are generating for revenue. Not only that, instead of using these catalyst to their advantage such as GME, they have made no changes. They have made absolutely zero changes to their board members, so essentially they are running the same operation after a bombshell like Covid- an operation already failing. 

I am a believer that AMC could squeeze and it should. But you are constantly working against a team of executives who give a shit if AMC survives. Why would you if you could be absolutely failing and gey a 2 million dollar bonus.

2021-04-07 12:59:03,wallstreetbets,"No no, thank you. I’m glad those bags are getting lighter to carry."
2021-04-07 14:36:23,wallstreetbets,"WSB douchebagery aside, I agree in principle, but it’s not happening for RKT for a variety of reasons. If RKT has a higher earnings report I think it could break this deadlock it’s in of reliably consistent ups and downs where it hovers at the same price. If they post lower than expected returns it will spiral all over the place some more. 

Right now, at its current price, I think it’s found it’s fair value based on what people are willing to pay. It’s trading at 13x earnings and that is remarkably average. There isn’t much reason for it to trade higher because it’s unlikely the housing market is going to remain as hot as it was during covid. 

Also, hopefully it will pop to 24-26 on Monday. The puts get cheaper and I love watching options slide ITW with a nice theta."
2021-04-07 15:31:17,wallstreetbets,It’s literally CTN but the original video is gone so you get a little bit of WSB fuckery at the end.

Buying at $29 and holding at $22 isn't ""bag holding""

You are a bag holder when you buy at any price then the company goes bankrupt and you lose all your money. Good grief"

2021-04-07 11:36:59,wallstreetbets,no it wouldn't because 3.5 million shares is like 5% of the float. it would only cause a drop of maybe 5-10% if they do sell now

2021-04-07 15:57:34,wallstreetbets,"I get around $3k a year in tax returns. That helps me save in all honesty. Other than that, only buy one new video game a month and slow down on eating out and buying junk you don’t need. It’s not too hard to save even when you’re only making $10-$15/hour so long as you’re not absolutely paycheck to paycheck. Hell I bought a house when I was making $9 and hour. It’s not impossible, and if it is, you need to move. You’re being priced out of the area you live in and you need to relocate somewhere that your job/lack of and the housing market are more in line. Is that the advice I’d give. My mortgage is about $400 a month for a three bed two bath. It’s like 1600 square-foot on paper but the attic is finished and not counted, as well as all the storage in the shed and basement. People seem to think they’re stuck, you can move with next to nothing and stay at a shelter for 60 days or get an apartment for a couple months while looking for a cheap place. There was just a house/duplex for sale down the street a few months ago for $15,000 (it needs a ton of work, but if you can flip it there’s so much profit there)"

2021-04-07 11:52:10,wallstreetbets,I understand that but this is chess to me they can if they wanted to avg down to gain a more better profit they are are all up on tits on stocks and it did drop to 90$/80$ that literally gives the middle class a more better opportunity to buy the stock and cause avg down for those tht have it at 200$ and up. It would just be smarter to have the take off w more help on our side. They want us to win they really do but chess wise we can get more middle/ lower income class into this to cause a better lift off at a decent price. For those tht cant afford it right now.
2021-04-07 12:09:49,wallstreetbets,Yeah i guess lol someone tht has 72 shares at avg 126$ yeah i guess im retarded for asking a question to clear what i wanted to know lol

2021-04-07 13:26:40,wallstreetbets,I put 15k. Went 32k a few weeks ago to 26k to 25k today. Most of that came from options. Got 4k from options. But then I got scared of options when I lost 700 so I went back to stocks. So as of today i made about  60 percent off my initial investment Which is good but I want Morrre.

2021-04-07 19:26:17,wallstreetbets,"Rent.

I lost my apartment in 2018, retired parents let me live at home rent free. Pandemic hits and well, still living at home rent free. Father insist I invest as much as I can. 

My savings for the decade I lived on my own after High School? $-3,000.

1 Pandemic at home? Roughly $15,000 invested turned into $38,000, and about $19,000 in debt paid off (medical bills, paid off car, paid off credit card debt from losing job in 2008)

Rent costs are fucking destoying people. I paid 80%+ of my income on rent alone. Its no wonder I couldn’t save any fucking money, the system is setup to take most of it. I couldn’t afford a fucking car till I was 28, just because the initial cost, maintainence, and gas costs would have made me homeless; even a junk shit beater car. I had $20 if I was lucky at the end of the month after paying rent and bills."
2021-04-07 18:39:25,wallstreetbets,I managed to accrue 10k in just a year or two by putting 200 a month into safe stocks.  That’s just $7 a day.  Lots of people pay more than that for coffee and restaurant meals.
2021-04-07 17:25:21,wallstreetbets,"Ok .... your ape accountant here... stop giving $3k interest free loan to the government each year only for them to give it back at the end of the year.  Your goal is to break even with them.  Save money yourself each month and use it to make more money.  This is not financial, accounting, or tax advice.  If you can trade, you can save."

Our house prices are ridiculous. I made 100k last year and I'm not even close to being able to buy a shitty house.

For reference a shitty house here costs about $600,000. Which means absolute minimum down is 30k for a first time buyer. And that's *if* I'm cool living in a crime-and-homeless neighbourhood with max 3 bedrooms and 2 baths"

You want to get real cheap you can go over to Jeannette, houses are like 60,000 for the same size. Much worse school district, much worse area. Maybe 10-20 minutes away. Again, 20-30 the other direction gets you to some real money."

I’d still pay the same 450ish pay now. Never pay the minimum if you can afford to. Also, have it auto pay weekly instead of monthly. Every week you pay a little more and have a little less for the interest to hit; I was projected a 28 instead of 30 years just due to the weekly payments."

It is also the largest recycler in Latin America and around the world it transforms, each year, millions of metric tons of scrap into steel, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable development in the regions where it operates. (Recycle? Environmentally friendly? Sustainable? Are these words that a certain political party would love to hear?)

\-CLF (company that produces steel) has been on a rip.

\-Railroad companies have been on a rip lately. Railroad industry uses hella steel!

\-Biden announced his infrastructure plan to revitalize the economy. A $3 trillion dollar plan is enormous, not any single steel company will be able to produce enough to meet the demand.

\-Options be looking hella cheap. 55% Implied Volatility.

\- Chart looks spicy. The past 8 days of trading 6 of them were above 2 standard deviations in volume. Basically this means big money is accumulating.

\- Today the price action broke out of it's weekly expected move. If it can keep above it, this is major bullish.

(TIP FOR THE DAY) For those who do not know what the fuck a standard deviation is (this is for the smooth brains) basically the stock volume is trading outside of where 95% of the volume should occur on average (2 standard deviations is where 95% of the volume should occur). Means someone with fat wads of cash is buying. Please for the love of god if you do not know what standard deviation is look it up. Learning is good for apes.

Absolutely bullish as fuck particularly on their digitization; moving big numbers through online sales surprisingly. Plus they absolutely crushed earnings last year and that's only with a few months of economic growth from lessening Covid restrictions. Think they're going to blow it out of the water when they report some time in May

And these 6c for 5/21 are juicy, juicy, juicy

Only picked up 10 but if this gets some serious upward movement, it could be a nice pay out

OP looking for a 20 bagger if this pops. Good luck to you

Only bearish thoughts are that were at ATH and price saw a significant dip after earnings 10/28"

2021-04-07 13:31:45,wallstreetbets,An example. In general I think steel companies in the US will obviously benefit from the infrastructure bill. It also ran up 15-20% the day of the announcement (CLF).

2021-04-07 13:30:01,wallstreetbets,Yes I do think that. CLF’s acquisition of ArcelorMittal put it as the largest steel manufacturer in the US. Cleveland Cliffs Indiana Harbor has the largest blast furnace in the US now and supplies itself with plenty of its own raw materials.
2021-04-07 13:44:52,wallstreetbets,Agreed. I think I know why. They just bought AK Steel and the US branch of ArcelorMittal. They will be selling an *anti-bacterial* coating for steel ductwork.

Obviously not all of the money in the bill for transportation infrastructure will go to steel but it seems like CLF won't be able to supply the amount needed on it's own. This is a very crude way to calculate whether they will be able to meet production entirely by themselves but you get the idea."
2021-04-07 17:52:31,wallstreetbets,All steel is rising soon. Theres just too much demand right now and not enough supply.

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Gamma Squeeze on VIAC because of HF failure. Ok so I have been in VIAC for a while before this whole crap show of a dip. Never played it for squeezing. When the dip came I went to work and charted the crap out of it and forecasted a bottom at $40 (we hit $39.81 before moving positive). Check. Start recovey. Price target $60 and $75 YE.

Now while talking with my fellow apes about price predictions this week and future forecasts I decided to take a look at the options chain and noticed something pretty great.

RSI is oversold territory right now with the price increasing on the daily candle. Stoch RSI poised for uptrend and MACD momentum shifting. We are entering an uptrend. Again supporting that $40 bottom and new (technically 2020) trend channel.

VIAC closes above $45 by WE easily and apx 61k calls are ITM, apx $270.1M. We are already there.

VIAC can close a very doable price of just above $49 Friday now 150.1k calls are ITM or $676.26m.

This quite literally puts all the calls ITM and all the puts OOTM Friday.

This pattern of calls continues until June 18th. With most calls in the same window. With VIAC holding $50 before weeks end we may be looking at a Gamma Squeeze coupled with fomo rocketing it back up to it's former price point, then repeating all month. There is also some borrowed shorts in there that would get screwed as a nice icing on the cake.

***EDIT*** wish I could post the picture maybe I'll have to photo bucket it. BUT

Right now VIAC is trading in the same channel it entered in May 2020 before the run up this year. It's a more stable  trendline than the path it was on before the dip. It's been in this channel 84% of the time in the last 14 months. It's at a more stable price than it's been at Feb.

**Edit*** pictures added

***Edit***

Add some explanation to the chart. Ignore the studies those are for my daily scalp and swings/TA I'm not pulling them lol.

Watch the channel trends.

The big ass red line is the downward is the trend that started in 2014. VIAC literally was at the end of a down wards triangle on the 1mo/ yearly chart and breaking out and up. I used that trend line with the 2020 trend channel to find the 2021 breakout.

I then used those with the descending channel (not shown) and a deviation (other yellow channel)to find the stoping point of $40 which I ended up being about 20 cents off.

This now has us in the 2020 channel again perfectly ready to bust, looking to use the deviation channel as that point of turn.


**Edit** ok I removed my studies. You can see the blue 2020 trendline that we are in pretty solid right now previously talked about, and the other channels (less the latest down channel) used to chart the course.[VIAC Trend 1Mo candle](https://app.photobucket.com/u/lk-twoonefive/a/f66e1f19-2aee-4fcb-acb9-1c2880488adc/p/6ca3e0c5-d5ac-4c5b-9185-7c6ea8de71e0)

***Addition 4/8/2021****

Price is a bit lower today but right in the expected channel. Testing the bottom several times. This is that blue trend channel from 2020. The yellow overlaid channel now the 2021 offset. Top of the 2020 channel tomorrow is $48 and change. Anything over $45 puts the majority of calls and nearly all the puts on the table.

2021-04-07 16:13:01,wallstreetbets,"Yes the trend channel we are in(blue channel in the picture) I know it's hard to see has a low of $42.92 and a high of $48.78.

Closing above that puts good pressure on the price to Squeeze at over $50 on the 16th. But $48.78 is close enough that $50 is possible by close of business this friday. And if that happens it goes now. Then my theory is it continues next week and the next and the next as those options like you pointed out are in that window where over $50 puts literally billions of dollars ITM."
2021-04-07 16:53:20,wallstreetbets,It may dip a bit to around $42.30 but I think that's it
2021-04-07 17:05:53,wallstreetbets,Gotta love the safety net
2021-04-07 10:30:48,wallstreetbets,It's not a short Squeeze. It's a gamma squeeze. Triggered by call options. @$49 strike all the calls are ITM totalling about $676.2m in shares  @$45 strike $270.1m in shares. These strike prices replicate to June 18th.
2021-04-07 19:49:52,wallstreetbets,"Wait, you came on your desk?"
2021-04-07 13:29:40,wallstreetbets,ticker is VIAC.. it's the class B shares
2021-04-07 13:51:46,wallstreetbets,Those 1/21 calls had a nice premium.
2021-04-07 15:57:46,wallstreetbets,Me too but I’m a little concerned lol
2021-04-07 16:13:59,wallstreetbets,Yea my chart studies overlaid with my drawings looks like shit but it's organized chaos.
2021-04-07 17:11:11,wallstreetbets,"It's a red market day, I think it held well. Powell speech tomorrow."
2021-04-07 12:36:39,wallstreetbets,"We have a pretty good idea. Sum up the amount of volume over the past week and the amount of shares held by known Archegos counter parties (Goldman, Morgan, Credit suissez, Nomura). Based on public info, we know the first three are already out, and we can speculate about Nomura.

Is it risky? Ya, of course. But this type of fire sale forced selling doesn't happen often, and people shorted the fuck out of the company to punish the sellers even more, so it's reasonable to think a strong rebound occurs once everyone knows that everyone knows the forced selling is basically done.

See DISCB as a case study, and why I am playing VIACA."
2021-04-07 11:53:40,wallstreetbets,"We wont know when the HFs are done unwinding positions until it is already complete and $VIAC bounces off the lows. 

Spread out buys, mix shares with options and sell the closer dated options at set date/gain/loss to keep pushing them out. Have an exit strategy. 

Definitiion of exit strategy - sort of like a courtesy tap, except for investing."
2021-04-07 11:59:15,wallstreetbets,Right now VIAC is trading in the same channel it entered in May 2020 before the run up this year. It's a more stable  trendline than the path it was on before the dip. It's been in this channel 84% of the time in the last 14 months. It's at a more stable price than it's been at Feb.
2021-04-07 12:27:53,wallstreetbets,"Ducks are just feeding the selloff, tbh I think it might be an attempted distraction to tie up funds that could be used to go-to the moon. But that's all conspiracy talk."
2021-04-07 10:45:59,wallstreetbets,That's why you should buy long/ calls:)
2021-04-07 11:47:25,wallstreetbets,"Short term, I agree 100%. I'm not expecting > $47 until about mid april. The financials are strong, so I'm investing for the time after that.

I have bought a lot of leap calls. If it stays in the $40s by the time my next paycheck hits, I plan on buying more."
2021-04-07 12:52:23,wallstreetbets,"Just like on GME, have you consider they own the Calls as well?"
2021-04-07 12:40:06,wallstreetbets,"Nope not everything is. But if you read my position and can post why a gamma squeeze couldn't happen I would be happy to hear. FYI. First thing I said after the title is I've been riding VIAC all year taking profit.

PT is $60.

$50 starts the call option frenzy I believe is needed for a gamma Squeeze on this stock."
2021-04-07 12:41:06,wallstreetbets,"And you are using stale information and assuming no one else is aware of the large forced sellers that came to the market over the past week. It's known, and the majority of the shares have been absorbed. Look at the trailing week volume...about 25% of the cap traded yesterday alone."
2021-04-07 12:25:52,wallstreetbets,Damn sorry I tried lol
2021-04-07 12:27:28,wallstreetbets,Try again
2021-04-07 13:12:56,wallstreetbets,Solid PT of $60 is still 11% return
2021-04-07 17:28:03,wallstreetbets,"That's the gamble, welcome to the casino."
2021-04-07 11:36:48,wallstreetbets,didn't they stated selling is completed?
2021-04-07 14:14:35,wallstreetbets,is VIACA no good?
2021-04-07 13:56:04,wallstreetbets,I bought some viacp for the same reason
2021-04-07 18:59:32,wallstreetbets,You're doing it wrong. I bought more VIAC today at the PEAK!
2021-04-07 11:07:26,wallstreetbets,"It needs the attention of the mass of retail investment available. I think there is a lot of people who have noticed this potential, it just needs the call to arms. The company is solid. So it's notike your squeezing something that has potential massive downside on the other end like AMC."
2021-04-07 17:17:04,wallstreetbets,"RemindMe! May 5, 2021"
2021-04-07 17:18:33,wallstreetbets,"RemindMe! May 21, 2021"
2021-04-07 10:40:37,wallstreetbets,"Well I bought the dip on DISCA and VIAC because they are cyclical / rotation plays, but looking at the charts, I do wonder if the YTD price action was essentially a gamma squeeze of sorts because of Archegos CFDs"
2021-04-07 13:13:05,wallstreetbets,I previously had thought that dealers D-G hedged the closer a stock moved to ITM (spot?) because it never made sense to me that a dealer had to buy or sell the underlying stock for every cal or put sold regardless of strike. But then the last GME squeeze happened when someone bought a shit ton of caps in the 600s so I thought I was wrong about that. But maybe that options whale caused actual buying which caused the price to move up and then dealers had to hedge?
2021-04-07 17:22:34,wallstreetbets,70@43.89 - do I win until the $42 crowd pipes up.
2021-04-07 16:10:55,wallstreetbets,[speaking of drug dealers and stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7okje/shout_to_ulampzworldwg22_who_borrowed_money_from/)
2021-04-07 14:04:52,wallstreetbets,LOL he's a polarizing figure. Apparently if you ONLY follow his Twitter and try to follow trades you lack a lot of context and will lose $$. They say if you are in his trading room you get a lot of the specific set ups and things work.
2021-04-07 10:43:05,wallstreetbets,"FWIW, I feel $VIAC also has the right narrative to gain some solid WSB/ Fintwit momentum given the HF failure. Totally the right narrative for big jumps once it gains a bit of traction."
2021-04-07 13:24:08,wallstreetbets,"Check out my two DD posts for more details. I will probably need to do a third because this aspect specifically isn't as well understood as I thought it was. No disrespect to you or anyone else, I just don't have a good feel for what most people know."
2021-04-07 17:06:11,wallstreetbets,Something AMC doesn't have.
2021-04-07 19:51:07,wallstreetbets,I was too excited about VIAC... Unexpected event put a solid company in a position for a squeeze instead of a failing company being shorted to shit... I just couldn't handle it.
2021-04-07 14:26:56,wallstreetbets,thanks I saw them and my ape brain no work
2021-04-07 16:01:01,wallstreetbets,"Don’t be concerned, I’m already up $3! Good enough to screenshot, good enough to sell?"
2021-04-07 16:17:49,wallstreetbets,"The big ass red line is the downward trend that started in 2014. VIAC literally was at the end of a down wards triangle on the 1m yearly chart and breaking out and up.I used that trend line with the 2020 trend channel to find the 2021 breakout.

I then used those with the descending channel (not shown) and a deviation (other yellow channel)to find the stoping point of $40 which I ended up being about 20 cents off.

This now has us in the 2020 channel again perfectly ready to bust, looking to use the deviation channel as that point of turn."
2021-04-07 11:59:34,wallstreetbets,I wish I could post a picture of this chart
2021-04-07 12:56:17,wallstreetbets,"Arch's was heavily leveraged into what is believed to be 80-100 billion dollars with a nearly 10:1 leverage.  Viacom's market cap is 25 billion.  

Don't you think insitutions would be gobbling up this once in a lifetime opportunity?"
2021-04-07 12:30:34,wallstreetbets,Works. You may want to take your other pictures private. :)
2021-04-07 17:30:43,wallstreetbets,ima just go all in on 150 calls for june
2021-04-07 15:21:56,wallstreetbets,"essentially, when the banks nuked Archegos, the bulk sold the shares to hedge funds for a discount. Now the HFs are looking to unload their cheaply bought shares for a profit. There is a good chance these shares will enter the market as the price goes up, creating resistance for further price gain."
2021-04-07 12:16:05,wallstreetbets,IDK about you but that's exactly what I would say to let the price rebound before dumping my second half if I needed billions of liquidity.
2021-04-07 11:46:16,wallstreetbets,Idk I’m looking at the chart now and it looks likes it still in progress. I hesitant to buy calls because wouldn’t the decay bring the value down? I definitely want to buy some.
2021-04-07 14:50:41,wallstreetbets,"I haven't looked at VIACA yet all my data is on the VIAC ticker. Just got to work but VIACA is leading VIAC, if the options are the same then VIACA is ahead of the game."
2021-04-07 15:54:11,wallstreetbets,"I have a 4:1 ratio in relatively cheap calls for VIAC/VIACA. 
  
Apparently VIACA is more risky bc volume is lower so you'd need to watch it like a hawk so smart/early money doesn't take profits and leave you (us) as bagsters."

2021-04-07 12:13:41,wallstreetbets,"I posted the chart I have you can see the return to the 2020 trend channel further supporting $40 was the bottom. Yea 2021 was a ride, the price is more stable now which makes this options action more viable."
2021-04-07 13:30:41,wallstreetbets,They are selling tons of calls and puts. They don’t need to hedge each individual option. What they do is take the net delta-gamma exposure of their book and hedge that.
2021-04-07 14:08:07,wallstreetbets,"99% of these Twitter/chatroom operators are frauds that are merely front running their user base and selling bullshit subscriptions/services because they can't make money doing anything else. Michaud is no acception, he's a fraud."
2021-04-07 10:45:11,wallstreetbets,"More potential here than AMC ever had. In the next 1-6weeks.

Could pull a DRV IE squeeze and hold for a couple weeks."
2021-04-07 19:54:14,wallstreetbets,Been there man.  Great DD BTW.  Bought some shares today but also thinking of grabbing some LEAPS.
2021-04-07 18:56:00,wallstreetbets,I bought mines at .95 lol
2021-04-07 16:23:21,wallstreetbets,"I out an all beit shitty screenshot of said chart.

If it's the moving average and studies(I use those for TA and finding entry/exits in scalps and swings) and focus on the channels.

The big ass red line is the downward trend that started in 2014. VIAC literally was at the end of a down wards triangle on the 1mo yearly chart and breaking out and up. I used that trend line with the 2020 trend channel to find the 2021 breakout.

2021-04-07 13:21:42,wallstreetbets,"1) you talked right past what I said, 2) look at the volume over the past week. People are indeed gobbling it up. You don't get that much notional trading with a flattish stock with tepid demand."
2021-04-07 12:31:22,wallstreetbets,Lol I'll have to figure that out
2021-04-07 12:32:00,wallstreetbets,"regardless, they have already announced how much they lost. and you also can’t disagree that at this price, it is indeed attractive."
2021-04-07 12:11:57,wallstreetbets,Posted a link to the chart showing the return to the 2020 channel. $40 was the target bottom. I don't think it's going any lower.
2021-04-07 12:32:42,wallstreetbets,"i believe it’s down due to the FOMC, and papa powell speaking tomorrow. it’s a market-wide pull back. so yup"
2021-04-07 17:31:43,wallstreetbets,Yea I just stuck with VIAC
2021-04-07 14:12:58,wallstreetbets,Makes perfect sense
2021-04-07 14:32:50,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't say fraud. I think 99% are bad and don't make good calls. I think maybe 80% are borderline fraudulent. But there is tons of knowledge if you know where to look and use a bit of judgement.
2021-04-07 10:51:33,wallstreetbets,"Totally more potential than AMC! Actually a solid business underneath the hood. Yup I'm holding, these price movements are a bit annoying though. I just don't understand why people keep waiting to buy, they will miss the entry if they try to time it. Itll shoot up on open $5-10 one day in the first 2 minutes."
2021-04-07 18:59:12,wallstreetbets,"So you’re down ~$15? Don’t worry too much yet. I was down BIG on my 4/16 $30 ASO calls, and that turned into a nice profit. We still have over 6 weeks to see some positive movement 👍🏼"
2021-04-07 13:25:26,wallstreetbets,"The price ranges seem pretty flat to me ever since the first selloff. They seem to go up significantly one day and then go back to exactly the same price the next. 

They're probably doing controlled sell-offs as to not cause even more panic and once Arch's positions are completely or mostly unwound, then they'll really start eating the shares."
2021-04-07 18:10:17,wallstreetbets,"They can't report official losses until all positions have been closed, sell off is complete! I'm riding with y'all"
2021-04-07 14:50:31,wallstreetbets,Well I’m holding calls now lol
2021-04-07 12:57:11,wallstreetbets,Yep market wide pull back. I bought the dip. It's starting to come back up a bit now.
2021-04-07 11:03:14,wallstreetbets,Even without a squeeze $60
2021-04-07 19:01:55,wallstreetbets,Yea you are right. It’s probably not smart to average that call down right?
2021-04-07 13:37:54,wallstreetbets,Prices are up almost 13% since the bottom at $39.81. consolidation at $44-45 is favorable.
2021-04-07 13:29:08,wallstreetbets,"Do you not read the news? And what about that volume, as a % of their cap, and share price clobbering looks like a 'controlled selloff' to you?

Again, you are working with stale information and applying it forward. You need to do more digging."
2021-04-07 19:05:45,wallstreetbets,"I probably won’t if it continues dropping, but averaging down’s not a bad idea if you really believe in your pick."
2021-04-07 13:37:42,wallstreetbets,"What news? Has the selloff stopping been officially announced? The volume could literally mean anything, people buying the dumps and other Hedgies buying and dumping. A lot of hedgfunds bought at prices that are significantly higher than what they are now (sold to them by Morgan Stanley before anyone knew how much leverage was behind the stocks because Hedges didn't have access to information from the other banks) and it seems reaaaaaally strange that they are not quadrupling down on their shares and using Total Return Swaps and more leverage for these near arbitrage level stocks. 

Have you read the full story on what exactly happened between Morgan Stanley and its Hedge Fund clients, and then the massive selloff that happened after they sold the shares to the hedgies?"
2021-04-07 19:07:19,wallstreetbets,Thanks man and good luck see you on the other side
2021-04-07 13:43:06,wallstreetbets,"I have a Bloomberg in front of me and have been monitoring this story closely, so I've seen every news article linked to Viacom and the known Archegos counter parties over the past week and change. I have the holder list with the known Archegos counter parties flagged with a volume overlay of everyone's exposures as a percentage of the volume traded.  So yeah I think I have a good understanding for what's going on. That doesn't mean my trade will work, but I am fully aware of the setup.

What you just said about MS is pure noise, and anyone who got bagged there had more than enough volume to get out if they wanted. Your comments and observations are very naive and your information is stale. I think we are done here, good luck."
2021-04-07 19:48:43,wallstreetbets,OH SNAP

2021-04-07 12:38:41,wallstreetbets,Could easily sell conservative CC to build cash up for averaging down. Only do this if you want to sell the stock at your selected strike price. If not just turn off the app and check again in 1 year.

2021-04-07 13:38:21,wallstreetbets,I wanted to sell some calls on PLTR but IV was down lately and premiums are barely worth it... Decided it's a good time to buy leaps instead. Waiting for IV to pick up towards demo day to sell CC again.
2021-04-07 15:29:27,wallstreetbets,"I haven't run any tests to see if it's actually true, but I would suspect selling CCs on highly volatile stocks isn't that great in the long run compared to just buying and holding. 

If you're selling short dated calls a small pop will blow past your strike quickly, and if you sell something further out like 3 months, it's the same thing, these stocks sometimes go on ridiculous runs and you'll end up losing out a bunch.

I think a better strategy is selling longer term ITM puts, especially if IV is high, your CB will be lower than just buying the stock right now even if the put you sold ends up ITM, plus they have some good premium  attached.

Example of deep ITM puts:

June 18 27P are selling for \~$5.25, so if the stock stays flat till then your CB will be \~$21.75 or about 5-6% less than the current price, so your break even is quite good."

2021-04-07 13:30:53,wallstreetbets,"Not too late. HIMX is a Taiwan-based producer of superconductor parts. Their product is solid and they occasionally come up with something innovative, which is why the stock has jumped about 3x in the past few months.

This isn't a typical WSB bet though. They are super conservative, always have tons of cash on hand, lots of institutional ownership. If they have a downfall, it's that they don't take enough risks. 

That said, there is profit to be had as you can see above. They almost always beat earnings estimates ;)

I've been rolling HIMX calls since Nov last year. I heard about it from someone on here.

If I can figure out who it was I'll suck their dick because I'm up over $15k on HIMX and I started with only $100 in my first call option.

However I did fuck up this one:

HIMX 2021-Mar-19 6 Call
STC 10 @ 2.00 Limit DAY
December 30, 2020 at 12:17:08 PM EST

That would have been work ~$6,000 at expiry and I paid like $150 for it initially."
2021-04-07 15:30:16,wallstreetbets,Nobody will exercise the options because there is a price difference where you buy the share is more cheaper than exercising it.
2021-04-07 15:33:27,wallstreetbets,But doesn’t the option give you to right to buy 100 of shares per contract at the strike price? It would make you spend $5000 up front but shares would be worth 450k. Im not quite understanding what you are saying

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Arcimoto ($FUV) valuation compare to other EV companies Arcimoto ($FUV) valuation compared to other EV companies

Arcimoto ($FUV) is currently trading at a slightly under $500M valuation. Many other companies (especially SPACs) with fewer vehicles produced/sold to date and less clear plans to scale have multi-billion dollar valuations. For example, Nikola ($NKLA) $5B, Lordstown ($RIDE) $2B, and Workhorse ($WKHS) $1.7B.

In the last year, Arcimoto produced and sold \~100 vehicles to customers. They are planning to scale production capacity to 50k/year in 2022 in their new factory. Some companies valued over $1B still mainly have drawings and a couple of prototypes.

Arcimoto's produces inexpensive, 3-wheeled vehicles which makes them less of a direct competitor with Tesla ($TSLA). Direct competition from Tesla poses a real risk to the profitability of other EV players long term.

Arcimoto has gained pretty good traction and support from the Tesla community with Gali from Hyperchange on Arcimoto's board, their partnership with Sandy Munro, and Rob Mauer (Tesla Daily podcast) and Ross Gerber disclosing investments in $FUV.

On the other hand, many people are betting against Arcimoto's success with 23.59% of the float sold short as of 3/15 according to Yahoo Finance.

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

2021-04-07 10:19:33,wallstreetbets,"In the past 5 years, disney has never even reached $205 high. Their 52 week high was $203.02.

It took disney an entire year to go up $84.

How can you believe disney will go up another $100 in the span of 3 months? And that's just the break even price for $280.

Sure if disney goes up, the premiums will go up, it doesn't have to go up to $280+ for you to sell those contracts to profit. But you will be eating that theta decay for the next 3 months hoping the price would increase.

In the end, if disney hovers around $180-200 for the next 3 months, you will have to sell those contracts for a loss or minimal profit. Unless you are planning to wait it out until the deadline? Then those contracts will be expiring worthless since theres basically slim to no chance disney will reach $280.01 for those contracts to be in the money.

Edit: I looked again and it says you already lost 48%.
You might as well change the YOLO tag to loss porn"
2021-04-07 09:26:12,wallstreetbets,"At your strike price, disney is worth more than Tesla. You know, the company headed to Mars, creating robot cars, satellite internet, solar plus whatever other magic it has in mind. 

Disney likes to make sexual objectification out of underage girls and call them princesses. 

Ill take Tesla. 

Content is a commodity. Just as i hate paying for cable, i am not signing up for everyones streaming services. Espn is politisports i dont care for. 

Disney is worth $30 more per share than before the Rona. That is all Disney plus priced in. Now with parks/cruises re-opening, maybe a short run to $225 for summer travel. 

Then people figure out subscriber numbers are inflated. Why? Verizon gives away subs to disney plus with unlimited plans. Some of these only last 6 months. What is the loss rate on these subs, how many continue, what will a price hike do. 

I wish you luck, i love seeing crazy bets work out but i don't see it here."

2021-04-07 09:14:55,wallstreetbets,Meh Disney is a shit company that’s morally bankrupt and with a little luck finically bankrupt in the next decade or so as society really starts to address the predatory practices that this company partakes in. With that being said I hope it spikes real high and you can exit this with a bit o profit bud.
2021-04-07 09:32:15,wallstreetbets,Disney did a great job of ostracizing half of their US customer base. If you held stock you might be fine in a few years but these options are probably fucked.

marvel and star wars alone will keep disney slow growing.   add in the rest of their shit and they will match the avg of the market growth for the floor.  if it dips ill buy some.
not sure about july 16th calls op.. good luck"

Tesla is only doing one of those things. They make cars, that's it. Everything else is just other stuff elon is doing and has nothing to do with the value of Tesla."
2021-04-07 14:01:03,wallstreetbets,Just fyi you don't get spaceX or any of the other cool shit with TSLA. The stock is pretty much just the electric vehicle and batteries. So yeah DIS is probably grossly undervalued when you compare it to just TSLA the car company.

2021-04-07 14:36:08,wallstreetbets,"I totally agree with that, but the point is if we value Disney like Tesla it has a lot of room to go before it's all ""priced in"". 

Remember, the market can remain irrational longer than all of us can remain solvent. You just gotta go with the flow, at least that's what I've been learning. Nobody here has a crystal ball, and all valuations are bullshit at anything over book because we just don't know what tomorrow will bring."
2021-04-07 19:09:22,wallstreetbets,"TSLA is a symbol of status, both the car and owning the stock, therefore it's connection to fundamentals is largely irrelevant.  People brag about owning both, it's the male financial equivalent of a diamond."

Even Trump caught covid and he had to get the vaccine treatment to cure himself. 

All antivaxxers and anti mask people do their ""research"" on fb and tell other people to do real research.

You want me to also put on the tin foil hat? Ok. Have it your way. Haven't you heard the conspiracy theory that the anti vax movement actually came from russia and china to undermine the health of the american people? They want americans to die more and die faster. And people who are anti mask and anti vax are only spreading the plague further and helping communists break america apart from within.

China was really clever with covid. Not only did they spread it all the way to 50 american states without having to invade us, but they gave us the anti mask movement too. Now instead of americans helping each other survive, we are divided and fighting each other over ""fake news"" while china and russia are laughing at all the americans dying. Who needs to go to war with america when americans are already killing other americans.

I can guarantee you that this shit runs deeper than just yes mask or no mask. China and russia knows americans love their freedom. So the way they started the anti mask movement was by telling us wearing masks takes away our freedom. And *snap* just like that americans took the bait. And it went down hill from there.

You might think I am the sheep of liberals and science lovers and what not. But you are the sheep of the chinese and russians and don't even know it.

2021-04-07 09:45:53,wallstreetbets,At least the bag will disappear on the 23rd
2021-04-07 09:06:36,wallstreetbets,Like watching a toilet full of money flush.
2021-04-07 15:36:05,wallstreetbets,You're not even holding a bag if you don't convert these to shares
2021-04-07 15:42:57,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m straight up not having a good time
2021-04-07 15:47:53,wallstreetbets,This Ont. lockdown isn’t helping sentiment. Should be fine in the near term tho. If anything. Could he positive for the stock as more people are forced to stay home and hopefully smoke more weed.
2021-04-07 18:56:01,wallstreetbets,I am expecting a ×10 gain from apha and tlry stocks
2021-04-07 19:38:50,wallstreetbets,Lol that just looks like a normal day for me
2021-04-07 15:07:20,wallstreetbets,#this could go tits up or tits down.  I am betting on the latter.  Rip
2021-04-07 13:58:12,wallstreetbets,You're better off counting your losses
2021-04-07 14:24:41,wallstreetbets,"😁  FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

2021-04-07 16:10:04,wallstreetbets,🤡🤡🤡🤡
2021-04-07 13:43:11,wallstreetbets,Didn’t last year
2021-04-07 15:56:33,wallstreetbets,Not as of March 15th. But tlry is. But not that much either. Like 14 percent of the float.
2021-04-07 14:56:31,wallstreetbets,Yep
2021-04-07 18:21:34,wallstreetbets,"You are never alone, I am at $24"
2021-04-07 18:21:54,wallstreetbets,Close behind at 50%
2021-04-07 11:17:07,wallstreetbets,I’m praying the merger works in our favor. Went with APHA since it was cheaper.
2021-04-07 11:27:13,wallstreetbets,I have the same 40&40 I’m getting worried lol I’m down a lot but still holding thinking about buying more to lower my average we still feel good about this right?
2021-04-07 13:18:47,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately TLRY & APHA won’t feel the reward of the states legalising. They’re strictly Canadian brands, and for them to work in America would be breaking the law. 
If you want to be a part of this growing American weed market you should be investing in MSO’s. 
In my opinion TLRY & APHA will be dead stocks as the Canadian market doesn’t have that much room to grow. 
(For comparison the State of Colorado did more in revenue last year than the whole of Canada)"
2021-04-07 18:06:09,wallstreetbets,"Canadian weed companies like TLRY and APHA won’t have access to US weed markets when it’s legal in the US regardless.

A lot of people buying these weed stocks betting on them to moon when weed is legalised in the States here seem to be overlooking that critical point."
2021-04-07 15:00:15,wallstreetbets,This is kinda mild for weedstocks. They moon better to tho
2021-04-07 15:02:22,wallstreetbets,Hmm I think you should sell so it goes up then ;)
2021-04-07 14:25:12,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-04-07 12:08:19,wallstreetbets,I don't know how it couldn't.  More area to sell a product that sells itself. More places legalized it. More will. Nowhere to go but up. Won't be instant. Hang on get baked and wait for the sweet tendies
2021-04-07 13:59:04,wallstreetbets,Ok I am going try my hand I’m options may 7th 14$ call dumb or not dumb
2021-04-07 15:15:46,wallstreetbets,"They are already expanding into Europe. And settling deals in Mexico. 

More research less talking, look into Portugal"
2021-04-07 17:39:26,wallstreetbets,"This is not totally correct. Aphria already operates in the US with Manitoba Harvest (CBD producer) and also purchased SweetWater Brewing (craft brewery). While they are not producing cannabis in the US, these acquisitions were done strategically to create an entry point into the US market, should it be federally legalized"
2021-04-07 14:30:44,wallstreetbets,"All I’m saying is weed stock didn’t have a good day on 4/20 last year. Stock market never works so cut and dry like that, more likely scenario is  dumping on the morning of 4/20 because there’s always people ahead. Just my two cents take it or leave it"
2021-04-07 15:28:49,wallstreetbets,Right it’s the republican boogeymen grow up
2021-04-07 12:21:59,wallstreetbets,Literally can't go tits up.
2021-04-07 17:36:06,wallstreetbets,"Lots of people are worried they’ll get fucked on the merger by owning APHA, since they’ll only get like .83 shares of TLRY per APHA share. If APHA is less than 16% away from the TLRY price during the merge, their investment will actually lose value (albeit only temporarily, as the merger should drive up TLRY stock later on)"
2021-04-07 16:00:22,wallstreetbets,"In a reply to someone talking about states recently legalising weed??? You do realise they’re talking about America?
These companies benefit absolutely nothing from the expanding American market - the largest cannabis market in the world."
2021-04-07 17:45:40,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for letting me know about the acquisitions, but the cannabis market in America is progressing at too fast of a rate in my opinion. 
These companies are already being dwarfed by the new American counterparts. Ignoring the merger Tilray did 210 million in revenue in 2020 yet Cresco did 476 million. The longer the American legislation protects these American companies like Cresco the bigger they will grow and the Canadian companies will be left behind."
2021-04-07 17:57:31,wallstreetbets,"Prohibition is definitely hurting companies like Tilray and their chances at US entry. The sooner federal legalization happens, the better their odds of market entry will be. The US is definitely already heavily saturated with large cannabis companies, as you pointed out, and I agree that the Canadian market is nearly maxed out. That being said, I’m bullish on TLRY because of its international presence, such as with Portugal or the UK (*the largest grower of legal cannabis in the world, btw). US legalization would be a nice boost, either by expanding their market or just investor speculation, but I feel that their fundamentals suggest the possibility of a dominate global trade in cannabis.

*edited unclear info"
2021-04-07 18:09:36,wallstreetbets,"Isn’t it possible though that the ship has sailed? The lack of changes in legislation has enabled these American companies to grow to a size too big for the Canadian companies to compete with. 
The whole of Canada had $2 billion in sales last year. The whole of America had $15 billion+ in sales and some of the people still have no access to cannabis at all. This comes down to the fact that the population of America is ~10x that of Canada. 
US legalisation would not be a ‘nice boost’ for these Canadian companies. It would be unlocking the biggest cannabis market in the world. 

These American companies have grown to such a scale now that they actually dwarf the Canadian counterparts. It will be in the interest of the American people to protect their industries too. If you believe in weed and it’s growth in the future then surely you should invest in American weed companies with 100%+ YoY growth than Canadian ones which are likely to be blocked out from the US for the foreseeable future?"

2021-04-07 14:31:43,wallstreetbets,ACB had entered the chat
2021-04-07 11:45:38,wallstreetbets,Or sell puts?
2021-04-07 10:29:21,wallstreetbets,"No. Anyone holding this stock should sell it immediately. Two quarters ago they made more money selling shares then they did selling weed. **Then a week ago they announced that they are adding an extra 40% to the float in a new raise.** If you want a company to gamble on that will give you huge leverage, look at slang worldwide. They just released their 4th quarter numbers that blow this dogshit stock out of the water and it's currently trading at .32 cents a share. With a MC of 170 million. Compare that to this dog shit company that has a 2.3 billion market cap with the same or worse earnings."
2021-04-07 10:32:14,wallstreetbets,">This stock will be huge when they really start their weed banking.

So it's a weed company that doesn't sell any weed? And you guys this is a good investment."

2021-04-07 09:16:48,wallstreetbets,That's still too high
2021-04-07 10:15:23,wallstreetbets,Ditto-- I need to do some averaging down on this
2021-04-07 09:57:32,wallstreetbets,Nows your real opp to avg down.
2021-04-07 11:16:21,wallstreetbets,I'm at 2.60. No fun watching investment drop by almost 2/3rds.

2021-04-07 11:34:27,wallstreetbets,"less 420, more runner"
2021-04-07 10:31:03,wallstreetbets,if he paid $53 for the contract and then $50 to exercise thats $103 for 100 shares. Or $1030 for 1000 shares.
2021-04-07 15:55:46,wallstreetbets,So what you're saying is instead of just buying the shares for 1$ each you're buying calls for 50$ then spending another 50$ to exercise the contract which equals 100$. So you took a couple extras steps to end up exactly where you would have been if you just bought shares.
2021-04-07 12:10:43,wallstreetbets,Sell all 1000 and buy 3000 of slang worldwide or 1500 shares of high tide. Buy a bunch of toothpaste. It will gain more value in 12 months than SNDL.

2021-04-07 11:46:11,wallstreetbets,I wish I could see his face when he realizes he hasn't figured out a way to cut a share price in half
2021-04-07 12:31:33,wallstreetbets,"no no I think he's aware of the premium now but he's not counting that to the share price, so in his mind his break even is .50

2021-04-07 15:14:16,wallstreetbets,"Because your broker isn’t taking into the cost of the call itself. You spent $100 in total, your break even is $1 not 0.50. 

Think about it. If you truly only spent $0.50 per share you’d be able to buy calls, exercise, sell the shares for a 50% profit. It would be free money. Everyone isn’t doing that because it’s not. You might save 0.01 on the spread but your cost basis is absolutely not 0.50"

2021-04-07 11:43:19,wallstreetbets,"You pay the strike when you exercise. The call option give you the right but not the obligation to buy the stock at .50. You pay a premium to acquire this right (in this case the premium is ~.50)

If you choose to exercise your right you have to pay the strike (in this case .50) for the shares."
2021-04-07 15:32:29,wallstreetbets,"Lay off the weed, you have no clue what you're talking about."
2021-04-07 11:45:14,wallstreetbets,"yes, you are exercising your right to purchase at .50.

You also paid a premium for that option prior to this."

2021-04-07 16:38:20,wallstreetbets,"Bruh. But how much did you buy the option for??? That’s what he’s asking. Yeah if you exercise the option at 0.50 strike you only pay 50 dollars. But if the contract premium is 0.51, to buy that option you’re already paying 51 dollars for that contract. I’m sure you can do the rest of the math. Maybe not, this is WSB. Yeah your average cost on your 2950 shares say 0.50 because that’s what you bought the shares at, but it’s not taking into account the other 0.50 cent per share you spent buying options? Check how much money you spent total, out of your bank account, and how much you have investing. You may be surprised it’s not that different. Essentially all you did was find a way to have the rare green theme on RH show without making money."
2021-04-07 16:45:02,wallstreetbets,"Calls are not free. $0.50 calls cost $52. So to get the 100 $0.50 shares, you just spent $102.00. 
You could just buy the shares for $102.00
Your account will show that you averaged down, with your $0.50 shares, but it's not the whole story."
2021-04-07 11:52:18,wallstreetbets,Yes I saw that. You are paying $50 for 100 shares. Did you acquire that option for free?
2021-04-07 15:37:27,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately you don't.
2021-04-07 12:03:19,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-07 15:40:23,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-07 12:25:57,wallstreetbets,But you didn't buy at .50. You bought at .50 + premium. So your break even will be the current share price or a few cents higher. So why even do this?
2021-04-07 15:51:48,wallstreetbets,"Hi, ive been following you for the past few weeks. Im not fully understanding this -

You buy a $0.50 Call of 100 shares for $52 currently. The next day, you exercise it and buy it for 50 cents each (100 shares x $0.50 = $50). Total is: $102

Your average cost is $0.50 for 100 shares....and is showing +50% profit....but your Premium doesnt get figured into that?

If i take your Market cost of $2979.21 divided by your# of shares 2950 it equals out to $1.009 per share. The price it is right now. Im not understanding how you are saving like $3 per 100 shares."
2021-04-07 15:51:06,wallstreetbets,You're not factoring in the premium you paid for the contract. You paid 50$ for contract and then another 50$ to excerise the contract. You paid 100$ for 100 shares.
2021-04-07 12:27:54,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-07 16:05:48,wallstreetbets,He's not factoring the cost of buying the contract into his average cost per share. For whatever reason it's not adding up to him. He's not understanding $50(contract)+$50(exercise option)=100$. He thinks because he paid 50$ to excerise the contract that he essentially bought 100shares at half the price simply because he's not factoring in the premium he paid for the contract.

2021-04-07 12:28:53,wallstreetbets,"Bro forget sundial, I want what you're smoking."
2021-04-07 15:59:31,wallstreetbets,Holy shit! We have a real retard here. Dude you should be king of wsb. When you factor in the cost to buy the contract for 50$ and the cost of exercising the contract for another 50$ for a total of 100$ then you've essentially paid 1$ per share so your average cost per share would be 1$ not .50.
2021-04-07 16:01:41,wallstreetbets,"Your break even is 50 cents....the price drops from $1 down to 55 cents. Your still made 5 cents each right? No, you just lost 45 cents per share. 

The average price, doesnt factor in the premium you paid."

2021-04-07 12:33:57,wallstreetbets,"Brother. The average cost in your shares doesn't take into account the premium you paid for the call options. You need to keep track of that yourself.

I'm so sorry."
2021-04-07 16:12:55,wallstreetbets,Bro then your average isn't .50$ your average is 1.00$ per share because you have to account for the 50$ you paid for the contract. 50+50=100$ which gives you 100 shares. So average price would be 1$ per share.
2021-04-07 16:19:19,wallstreetbets,"I understand your holding them for longer term - But to ""average down"" is giving you a false number. 

You buy 100 shares for $1 each. Average cost = $1. 

You then also buy the 50 cent contract and exercise it. Average cost is 50 cents

Total Average cost will show for 200 shares: $0.75

Now the stock price goes up to $2 and you sell. Your total profit according to your ""Average price"" is (1.25 profit per share, 200 x 1.25) = $250

Actually, your profit is only $200. Your average cost is really $1 each. 

Averaging down like your doing, looks great on paper. But your screwing yourself long term when you go to sell. Your Profit isnt what it actually is."

2021-04-07 09:20:21,wallstreetbets,Time to buy more while it's still low. I'm in for another 500 shares today. This is great news... The more and more vehicle companies who use BB the more likely it will become the standard for this and other platforms.

2021-04-07 13:04:13,wallstreetbets,"Most cars are going to use BB. 

And dont worry about google/apple making infotainment, a car can use both qnx and infotainment apple/android. You wouldn't want BB handling your entertainment, you wouldn't want google/apple handling anything security wise or critical systems of your vehicle.

Simply put one might play you Taylor Swift Videos, the other is telling your car a critical part got damaged and it needs to push all system resources towards keep the car and brakes working. I wouldn't trust any modern car company not using BB.

As vehicles become more internet connected, security will be important. Dont want your data stolen, dont want your smart car gettng hacked. BB has a big future in this growing sector.

BB has worked with google before btw. If apple wants to get into cars they too will need to work with BB.


IVY with AWS will be increcible too.

Im thinking BB is a possibible target for a potential buyout possible. If a google or AWS bought BB, theyd be undisputed in the vehicle software game. Not to mention there is $ to be made off people's data from their vehicles."

Time's up hedgies.  The people you've fucked over are taking names. 

The apes are uniting and providing an opportunity for the big players to do some shit. It's as if the nerds and the goth kids have formed some kind of weird alliance.  It won't last long, but it's something."

At $4,  you are pricing in a huge chance of bk.

Usually news of stock offering triggers a sell off because of dilution of the shares. People risk seeing the value of their shares go down and so they take their gains/cut their losses before it happens

Maybe they where hoping it would trigger a sell off in GME.

The only thing that I see moving the stock is transparency about the short positions in which case it either clearly shows the stock is massively overshorted or all shorts have been covered as some hedgefunds and every pundit loves to claim. If it's the first a margin call could happen, if it's the second apes will take their gains.

The Reddit-fueled surge in the video-game retailer’s share price is paying off, helping to raise cash and boost its chance of success.

What a crazy year it’s been for GameStop Corp. Last April, it was left for dead. Predicting an imminent demise for the retailer, hedge funds piled on their bearish bets and the company’s market value sank to a few hundred million dollars. A year later, thanks to big buying from the Reddit crowd, GameStop is worth about $13 billion and is now looking to raise as much as $1 billion in capital to fund internet entrepreneur Ryan Cohen’s turnaround plan. This year’s GameStop stock mania may make its business transformation possible.

The retail investor frenzy over GameStop shares has been well covered. But the stock’s rally has some fundamental underpinnings. It is not a coincidence that the surge began days after Cohen was appointed to its board on Jan. 11. Since joining in an official capacity, the co-founder and former chief executive officer of online pet-supply retailer Chewy Inc. has moved quickly, taking control of the company’s strategy and pivoting it faster toward e-commerce. He has hired nine executives — five of whom had experience at Amazon.com Inc. — including a new chief operating officer and chief technology officer. Several of the additional hires also came from Chewy, a sign of confidence from former colleagues in COhen’s abilities. Now, the company is raising the funds needed to implement his plan.

Early Monday, the company announced it will sell as much as 3.5 million shares worth as much as $1 billion in an “at-the-market” stock offering. It said the funds will be used to “accelerate its transformation” and strengthen its balance sheet. The video-game retailer also announced that its revenue for the five weeks ended April 2 increased by 18% compared with a year earlier, negating a part of the naysayers’ thesis that it is a declining business. While GameStop shares slumped in early trading Monday on news of the share sale, they recovered a bit as the day wore on, pointing to investor optimism for Cohen’s plan.

 It is a prudent and necessary move. With GameStop’s share price up nearly 900% this year, the company will be able to raise significantly more funds to expand its e-commerce capabilities. The turnaround plan outlined in its latest annual report includes building fulfillment operations for faster delivery times, overhauling its website and starting a U.S.-based customer service operation. All these initiatives are needed to improve GameStop’s customer experience and will require significant investments.

 GameStop’s latest executive hire may tip off even bigger ambitions. Last week, the retailer said it had appointed Elliott Wilke as its chief growth officer. Wilke spent the last seven years in senior roles at Amazon, including stints at Amazon Fresh, Prime Pantry and Worldwide Private Brands. His experience at the e-commerce giant’s private-label business may mean GameStop intends to some day launch its own branded hardware products such as gaming mice, keyboards and other higher-priced items such as gaming PCs. If successful, this kind of move could generate higher profit margins much the same way as Amazon’s AmazonBasics and Costco’s Kirkland Signature product lines.

In another noteworthy development, GameStop has ramped up its offerings in the PC gaming hardware market in recent weeks. The retailer is releasing five-page weekly ad circulars focused on this niche, selling items such as $400 gaming monitors and $1,000 Nvidia graphics cards. PC gaming is a large and growing area and is not cyclical like the retailer’s core console-gaming market. On the back of its better-known brand, GameStop should be able to take market share from other PC e-commerce players such as Newegg and Micro Center.

In just a few months, Cohen has revamped GameStop’s senior management, adding executives with the required relevant technology backgrounds, while setting a clear vision for the company’s future and moving further into attractive product areas. This is an impressive amount of progress in a short time frame. With the coming fund raise, the company will have the capital to fully execute on Cohen’s vision. The so-called smart money should take notice."

2021-04-07 10:40:25,wallstreetbets,"This looks bad on paper but will ultimately play into our hands. They know a squeeze is likely it was outlined in their report, it's still in their best interest to wait until they get the best value for each stock. 3.5 million shares is still a small fraction of what hedgies have to cover. Come on be dumber"
2021-04-07 09:46:36,wallstreetbets,"They will, wtf are you thinking they are doing that for?

They plan to sell at $285 minimum lol

They'd be stupid as fuck for not doing this and honestly if they didn't my trust in their future would be severely limited."

2021-04-07 10:20:18,wallstreetbets,Agree.
2021-04-07 09:15:18,wallstreetbets,"You can't 'not notice' an issuance of new stock, because they have to announce when it happens and how many shares they've added by law, and 'keeping a reserve' doesn't prevent a dilution of earnings per share.  It doesn't matter who holds the 3.5M shares of stock, the earnings per share value of existing shares decreases when there's 3.5M more shares to split earnings with.

The stock price may hold steady or even increase if there's enough buying pressure, but to say that the addition of 3.5M shares would slip under everyone's radar if they created the shares but don't do anything with them or sell them one at a time is being silly."
2021-04-07 09:50:01,wallstreetbets,"I read somewhere because its ATM and a limited sell off, it will really only affect the share price like 20 cents too."

2021-04-07 14:18:39,wallstreetbets,"I agree to some extent, but start-up tech companies and delivery companies are priced at simply unreal valuations right now. If Chewy's 33B valuation is justified (when theyve never had a profitable quarter) a 12B valuation for GME is definitely justified."
2021-04-07 16:28:39,wallstreetbets," They're not issueing new shares, they're potentially releasing existing ones"
2021-04-07 16:35:07,wallstreetbets,"Initially I thought like this, but perhaps they plan to unload it slowly on the way to $1000 or on the way to $10k"
2021-04-07 14:21:47,wallstreetbets,"There is significantly more upside to GME than downside at this point, even though you're right and it could fail. GME has revenue similar to Chewy, and while as you mentioned Chewy has never been profitable GME was profitable last quarter. Chewy's market cap is.... about 3X that of Gamestop. As I said, significant upside. Gamestop also has assets like physical inventory so even in liquidation it is worth more than the 7$ a share it was trading for when I first bought."
2021-04-07 11:09:02,wallstreetbets,Walmart for 2. Shall I go on gay bear?
2021-04-07 11:26:29,wallstreetbets,"I don't expect it to be due to the stock ""mania"" but Ryan Cohen who was brought on to the GME team last year turned Chewy from a failing business into an online giant. Not saying he can do it again with gamestop... But that gives me more hope than any stock craziness."

This equation only works if hedgies are short on the other end, creating the scarcity of shares.

2021-04-07 12:23:57,wallstreetbets,"Eventually they’ll be margin called and forced to buy all the shares they owe regardless of it’s current price.

They owe over 100% of the shares available, meaning they’ll have to buy basically every share that exists, and then some more after that. 

If nobody sells at a low price, that means they’re forced to buy all the shares that are ready to be bought at $500, $600, $700, etc all the way up in the thousands and potentially hundreds of thousands if they still haven’t covered their shares and there’s still shares to buy at those prices.

If they can’t afford to buy, it’ll tear through their insurance instead, they have trillions of dollars in insurance so it can theoretically afford up to millions per share. 

This is how a short squeeze works. 

If everybody sells at $1000, then they can buy all 70 million shares at $1000 each, then it doesn’t go higher than that, and that’s the end of the squeeze. 

If people hold until $10,000 then sell at $10,000, then they’re forced to buy all the shares at $10,000.

Etc etc, if everybody holds all of their shares till $1,000,000, then they’re forced to buy at $1,000,000.

The only thing stopping the share price from hitting $1,000,000 is if apes sell at a lower price, that’s all, so if everyone gets into the mindset of selling at $1,000,000, it can be $1,000,000 per share. 

So... could it hit $1,000,000? Theoretically speaking yes, assuming everybody who holds GME holds it well into the $10,000, $50,000, $100,000, $250,000, $500,000, $750,000 price tags.

How many people here can actually look at their $4,750,000 worth of GME shares and think “I’m going to keep holding”. How much trust do you have in other people to see those massive numbers in their app and still not sell?

To your second question, it’s possible for them to keep the price low, like they’re already doing as we speak, but if nobody sells then there’s nobody to buy shares from, thus they can’t cover."

Nothing wrong with planning what to do with future millions. I believe we are all just few choices away from becoming millionaires. If we make the right choices it will happen.

Also the SEC would have come down on their ass HARD if they tried to unload $100M of stock at $400. No way their lawyers sign off on that."

2021-04-07 09:38:37,wallstreetbets,"I think you're confusing selling existing shares held by the company with creating new stock shares from nothing.  When a company creates new stock, they very much have to tell everyone that they're making new shares and how many are created, since it affects the holdings of every existing shareholder and it changes the perceived value of each share.  Simply buying and selling existing shares on the market by the company doesn't do that."

All of you could sell for $1000 per share but they need my shares as well so couldn't I set my price at 1,000,000 and that's what they would pay me because they need my shares as well? Total noob btw."

2021-04-07 19:58:54,wallstreetbets,"And if the increase is 70% hedgies covering and hedging shorts.... 

The hedgies ARE the buyers dingleberry.

The idea that the retailer segment has the amount of capital needed to move the market, such that the hedgies can't would mean that the retail capital would account for 80% of the money making high speed algorithm based trades.

Which A isn't mathematically plausible in an economy where a large population isnt employed, food secure, or even invested during a good economy.

And B would mean that average joes have more advanced computers, faster internet connections and more leverage than big institutions who pay millions to have their servers in the basement of the NYSE and have legally enforced limits on how long their fiber optic cables are."

2021-04-07 15:09:42,wallstreetbets,"They did have a deal in place already, that was close to expiring, close to expiring BECAUSE they never issued the shares in the first place, not at 500 in the first peak, and not at 350 on the second. this ‘new’ deal is just a continuation of what they already had. Sure slightly more shares than before, but they already have half a billion in cash, they will carry on not issuing the new shares."

Which it did at 40, for about a month... then it magically went up to 350 again? What do you call that. And now stabilising again at around 180. If you think this is normal then I’m sorry but you’re the delusional one here."
2021-04-07 13:55:10,wallstreetbets,"As far as I understand this was an amendment to a previous filing.  If the company is going to pull off this turnaround they will have to sell some shares eventually. But it is not this giant threat to the stock price you are making it out to be. 

Also, my Cost average is 40 bucks a share.  So this has zero effect on my position."
2021-04-07 10:23:05,wallstreetbets,"They aren't technically making any new shares. They're potentially releasing existing shares. They bought back a shit ton of their float over the past decade.

Either way. The original filing was for ~6 million shares in december. Now they updated to 3.5 million shares. Maybe the next update will be only 1 million shares. To date they haven't sold anything and appear to be waiting for the stock price to move much higher."

2021-04-07 18:38:15,wallstreetbets,"Amazon had the advantage of being the first to the market with pretty much zero competition.

Gamestop on the other hand is like Blockbuster video in this scenario. They invested too much in their brick and mortar stores (which will mostly be shuttered in the next 5 years) and sat on their ass way too long before going digital. Now there are several titans they must compete against in the digital software market who already have strong footholds and a strong user base (Steam, Epic, GoG, etc.).

Epic only really succeeded in their store by spending insane amounts of money to get exclusives and to essentially give away free games every week to secure new users. I can't imagine Gamestop being able to come anywhere close to that with their limited resources. At best they'll be a ThinkGeek type shop that specializes in bobbleheads and other toys but also sells games."

2021-04-07 12:52:12,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but then they’re just buying back shares at the exact prices they sold them at.

What they’ve been trying to do is drag down the price in the hopes that apes will go “THE PRICE IS FALLING QUICK SELL SELL!” So they can buy the  shares from all the people now selling at a lower price. 

But if you look at the stock, there’s a 3:1 buy ratio, meaning for every 1 person selling, there’s 3 people buying, people just keep buying the dips. So as things currently stand, there’s nothing to buy back."
2021-04-07 15:49:15,wallstreetbets,Thank you my ape. Wish you the best of luck.
2021-04-07 15:37:03,wallstreetbets,"They can buy the same share multiple times.

Let’s say they owe 120% of shares, If 70% of shares are sold by apes, hedge funds will buy it, give it back to the original owners, then those original owners will sell it.

Hedge funds will then buy 50% of those shares that the original owners just sold, then give it to remaining 50% of people they owe. Then that’s it, the squeeze is over and done with. They’ve successfully bought and returned 120% of the stock, while only using 70% of the actual shares to do so. 

The poor apes who are still holding at this point will see the price shoot right back down."
2021-04-07 15:34:59,wallstreetbets,"Because its shorted that means theres more shares than actually exist in our hands. That also mean we dont know who owns fake shares and who owns real ones. If you have fake shares then they dont need to buy yours and If you wait long enough then all the real shares maybe accounted for and now they dont need to buy your fake.  

This is why its key to focus on all of us diamond handling so we can all get a good price. Because If we go every ape for themselves people will be left bagholding."

2021-04-07 18:29:58,wallstreetbets,">I like to think its because of how soft people are becoming today,

This is nothing more than a dumb talking point used by boomers to make them feel superior to later generations. The fact is Boomers had the easiest economy for making a living and every successive generation has had it harder. Boomers could graduate from college debt-free simply by working during the summers, and could buy a family house on a single income. I would argue modern generations are much tougher, I know many people who work 60-80 hours a week just to make ends meet. 

Of course, if you simply mean ""Zoomers cancel me for being racist, this generation is too soft."" Then yes, this generation isn't as soft as the boomers."
2021-04-07 17:40:26,wallstreetbets,"LOL I know. We're just a sad bunch of pathetic nobodies. Seriously, I thought we were kinda cool.

2021-04-07 18:23:04,wallstreetbets,"Some part of my subconscious still thinks that it couldn't have been more than 8 or 9 years since Clinton was president, so I understand that feeling.

But that's not the point - it doesn't matter how long it took Amazon to become profitable.  It doesn't matter how long it took Chewy to become profitable.  The point is, simply adding a board member from a successful company is not some kind of panacea that will automatically fix a failing business that's struggled for a decade.  If it was that easy, no business would ever fail.

*Maybe* Gamestop will be the first to actually pull this off, but there's absolutely no reason to think that will be the case - Gamestop has all kinds of looming liabilities and potential problems stemming from decisions made years ago that **never** get mentioned here, and even without those things, still no reason to believe it's found the magic board member who will save the whole show - no reason to think a person like that exists or will ever exist."
2021-04-07 13:28:11,wallstreetbets,"That’s the major issue with retail brokerages, their reasoning is that every time they create a limit order, they have to pay out of their pockets to do it, so they don’t want to waste their money on random people putting ridiculous prices for the fun of it. 

GME is a whole different thing though. But odds are they’re not going to change that limit order rule just for a few meme stocks.

Like people who tried to buy at $370 and realised they just paid $420 per share instead."

2021-04-07 12:15:31,wallstreetbets,"I'll take a stab at this. Other brokers may borrow shares to fulfill contract obligations, provide liquidity, or cover a shortfall in demand.

Borrowing shares isn't done only for shorting. It's sort of like how you can't use ""short volume"" to indicate how much a stock is short-sold; the name ""short"" doesn't mean borrow-to-sell intrinsically in the stock market."
2021-04-07 12:33:21,wallstreetbets,The availability to borrow could also decrease when the supply decreases. Someone not wanting to lend out their shares anymore or someone selling his shares.

2021-04-07 12:47:48,wallstreetbets,That’s my point.
2021-04-07 18:35:59,wallstreetbets,"Extremely hard to calculate, there’s no strict “this date” to use, they can push back the due date, they can extend the time it takes to cover, for every date they miss they pay fines, and if they don’t have any more money to pay fines they can continue borrowing money. 

Just have to wait for all of this to burnout before it happens."
2021-04-07 15:30:34,wallstreetbets,"The thing I told you to search for shows the ratio for the most popular stocks. GME is one of them. However that's just Fidelity's ratio. If someone else knows how to see it for the entire market, I'd love to hear how."
2021-04-07 17:58:55,wallstreetbets,"Nah nah. We’re the current adult age that people think of when they close their eyes. 

But we don’t get any recognition for it.

2021-04-07 16:34:38,wallstreetbets,"Sorta? Maybe?

It's just normal traffic with stocks, in my estimation. Since we cannot determine whether it's a lend for a short sale, or to cover other broker activities, it's impossible to say. 

I think there are better indicators than the moment-to-moment borrowing and many other ""signs"" that this stock is still heavily shorted, but I'm in GME for a longer-term position."

Then, it is thrust into the heat once more until its very structural integrity is almost literally melting. Its reward for this? It is removed from the flames once more, to be beaten, and hammered all over again.

This process is repeated multiple times. Many more than a layman would guess at or imagine.

It never really occurs to them that they've been saying the same thing since GME cost $38.

Perhaps it is the simple fact that if they had simply bought into GME at that $40 price they would've seen more gains than on any of their other trades and it is just their bitter jealously manifesting itself.

""It has to be over, it has to be"" they think to themself as PLTR drops another percent.

This would serve two purposes: 1. I would have to cover my shorts at a lower fee! Cool!  2. Maybe the people holding the stock would start to think it's acting like a boomer stock, and they'd sell, allowing me fewer shorts to cover. I know the people like the rollercoaster, so I take that away, then just wait. Surely they'll get bored and tired of seeing red in their portfolio. Right?

Melvin Capital was a hedgefunds of the suits, so powerful and so wise he could use the shorts to influence the mercantile exchange to create shares… He had such a knowledge of shorting that he could even keep the positions he invested in from liquidating. The dark side of trading is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so leveraged… the only thing he was afraid of was liquidating, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught WSB everything he knew, then WSB liquidated him in his positions. Ironic. He could save others from liquidating, but not himself.  "

2021-04-07 14:18:51,wallstreetbets,"The way I see it is this:

The volume is at pre Jan levels. Meaning the HF’s have done what they do best and hedged... but now we sit at $170-190 not $10-20

The different now to then and apart from the price is minimal. The squeeze hath not squozeth.

We just need to wait for another BIG catalyst to rock the boat. When and in what form that appears we don’t know.. it could be *if* Cohen becomes CEO. It could be something else a couple of months out.

Cuban said something akin: “time is your friend. Buy more increase your position. If what you believe in is still true then hold and buy”. - i recommend reading the actual quote. It’s inspiring stuff."

Today I liquidated my bank savings account, so I feel like Michael Burry walking up to an investment firm with a duffle bag of cash. (I'm a europoor so savings ain't much but it's what I got). Feeling 100% confident in GME, prepared to hold however long it takes. Michael Burry had to endure constant criticism and people telling him he was retarded for years, yet he remained unphased because he was confident in his own research. This is the level of zen we must achieve, apes."

So if they have borrowed 700k plus shares, is this their attempt to drop the value as much as possible?

If we all bought and are holding, they will be able to manipulate the price a lot since there is no one but them trading (that is substantial).

So the lower they are able to manipulate it, that should be taken as a good sign since it means no one but them are selling?"

Expect low volume for a while. It means we aren’t selling."

2021-04-07 15:06:14,wallstreetbets,801 will not margin call a HF. Everyone Please stop spreading this. 801 gives the NSCC the leverage to force liquidity requirements to it's members. It's members are mainly banks and brokers. The brokers and banks can apply pressure to their clients (HF) to cover or close out their positions if they don't have liquidity. The DTCC/NSCC do not regulate or control HFs. I say this cause ppl will think that if 801 gets passed that will auto margin call a HF and it won't. It def helps but again it will be up to the NSCC members which do not include HFs. Just continue to buy / hold if you can.

2021-04-07 09:07:30,wallstreetbets," On  this day, April 7th in 1971, a secret team of German and Swedish  engineers attempted a feat only the Americans and Soviets would  accomplish for many decades to come. Details of the mission were finally  declassified 50 years later.

The  mission team for the AFFE-Zwölf was comprised of the two experienced  test pilots Hans Albrecht and Elias Hödl as well as two laboratory  chimpanzees, with the goal of beating the Soviets to a possible moon  landing scenario although officially only a moonshot attempt would be  made.

During the mission, there  was a catastrophic failure of the navigation system and Albrecht had to  switch to manual controls while approaching the moon, and was able to  avoid disaster with his keen visual insight to keep the craft 100km  above the lunar surface. However, they would need to reduce the mass of  the orbiter at their altitude to escape the moon's gravity, and Mission  Control advised the two men not to descend to the surface as recovery  would be impossible. They chose to place the chimpanzees into the lander  and detach the module from the orbiter in order to return home to Earth  while the lander made a controlled descent to the moon.

The  two Germanic astronauts made it safely back to Earth, where Mission  Control gave Albrecht the nickname ""Diamant"" for successfully navigating  the damaged AFFE-Zwölf and landing a pair of chimpanzees on the lunar  surface. As it was a secret project which violated the Potsdam agreement  and would have caused tensions with the USA and Russia, information on  the project was only declassified in 2021.

*TL;DR: ""Diamond"" Hans brought the apes to the moon with Hödl.*"

So, looking through it.... it's going to force people to have the shares for all types of trading.  Recursive lending, not going to happen.  However, this was, apparently, released for comment on April 1.  (no kidding)  It still has a tremendous amount of strikethroughs and additions.  I don't if it's in a 'final' copy yet.  However, from everything I read it can take 7 to 21 days for this to be implemented.  So, this will be an extra rocket booster once it's put in play somewhere before now and April 30th.

Back to chilling and villaining because when the shit blows, be ready to be villainized by the media. 

Villainized because some retail traders/apes decided to HOLD one overly shorted stock to:

A. Make tons of cheddar 
B. Identify a system with large gaping holes in it's structure, taken advantage of by a small group of people who utilize loopholes to both make money and pay as little taxes as possible.

Oversight and regulation are often decried by libertarians who want as little govt interference as possible, but look at Wall Street, it's about as fair as a high school bball team playing against an NBA team.

2021-04-07 11:33:47,wallstreetbets," On   this day, April 7th in 1971, a secret team of German and Swedish   engineers attempted a feat only the Americans and Soviets would   accomplish for many decades to come. Details of the mission were finally   declassified 50 years later.

The  mission team for the AFFE-Zwölf was comprised of the two  experienced  test pilots Hans Albrecht and Elias Hödl as well as two  laboratory  chimpanzees, with the goal of beating the Soviets to a  possible moon  landing scenario although officially only a moonshot  attempt would be  made.

During the mission, there  was a catastrophic failure of the  navigation system and Albrecht had to  switch to manual controls while  approaching the moon, and was able to  avoid disaster with his keen  visual insight to keep the craft 100km  above the lunar surface.  However, they would need to reduce the mass of  the orbiter at their  altitude to escape the moon's gravity, and Mission  Control advised the  two men not to descend to the surface as recovery  would be impossible.  They chose to place the chimpanzees into the lander  and detach the  module from the orbiter in order to return home to Earth  while the  lander made a controlled descent to the moon.

The  two Germanic astronauts made it safely back to Earth, where  Mission  Control gave Albrecht the nickname ""Diamant"" for successfully  navigating  the damaged AFFE-Zwölf and landing a pair of chimpanzees on  the lunar  surface. As it was a secret project which violated the  Potsdam agreement  and would have caused tensions with the USA and  Russia, information on  the project was only declassified in 2021.

*TL;DR: ""Diamond"" Hans brought the apes to the moon with Hödl.*"

Citadel worth- $384b in managed assets
Melvin cap worth- $8-$23b in managed assets
Susquehanna llc- $612b in managed securities 
Clearing house insurance- $67trillion
There are a lot of other funds and brokers and banks involved that will be liquidated waaay before it makes it up to the clearing house then clearing house insurance then federal reserve.. but let’s just run with ONLY those figures for now. So let’s add that up... roughly $68 trillion

Now Let’s also start with the HIGHEST number of shares they could have to buy and let’s say it’s 1billion shares.. 

So let’s divide $68,000,000,000,000 by 1,000,000,000 shares.. we get $68,000sp

That’s not counting all the other hedgefunds shorting this. And yes I know not all of their assets will be liquidated for gme they will have to pay off all other short positions as well.. however.. I think those figures quite plainly show this stock will be going very very high.. MOASS indeed.

Articles have said ""Up to 3.5 million"", implying they want to sell at MAX 3.5 million shares. In theory, they could sell a single share for $1 billion. I'm holding out for this to happen.

So many people here are saying they can hold for years or over a year but I cannot. I am barely holding on and haven’t even sold one share yet. Some people just don’t have the option to just not worry. My online classes have been extremely rough on me and I wish things got better. I genuinely hope this changes my future but I am not counting my chickens before they hatch.

At this point the squeeze is very much possible, we are in a very good position. GME already said that they are ready to profit off of it, the bigger the price the lesser shares they have to sell, up to 1 billion in profit is what they aim for.

They have all the arsenal to cause it (reverse split, dividents, news etc). So if the squeeze happens they make money and also they will win a lot of publicity and costumers (the company that beat the shorts and people buying from them just to celebrate).

At this point I see no reason why they wouldn't just give the shorts the final hit and send GME in the thousands, make a quick profit and then proceed further away with the transformation.

2021-04-07 09:34:25,wallstreetbets,"Months After the GameStop Saga, Retail Traders Still Haven't Checked Out -- Barrons.com

Housebound retail traders made a splash in late January, when a group of Reddit users pushed stocks like GameStop(GME) and AMC Entertainment(AMC) through the ceiling. Their increasing participation in the market, especially via speculative options trades, has caused concern that stock trading could be more volatile.

Those market players are still highly active, even though vaccinations are helping restore a semblance of normal life, and stocks keep hitting new highs, likely leaving less space for big gains like those in 2020. Retail trading has receded from the peak seen early in the year, but mom-and-pop investors still remain way more aggressive than they have been over the past two decades.

Small-lot options trades, those involving fewer than than 10 contracts, are often viewed as a measure of retail interest. In the most recent week, small-lot volumes of equity call buying were down by roughly 50% from their peak in late January, wrote Susquehanna analyst Christopher Jacobson in a Monday research note. He cited data from Options Clearing Corp, the world's largest equity-derivatives clearing organization.

That is the lowest level since early November, but the percentage of options volume driven by small-lot trades is still meaningfully higher than it was before the pandemic. The trading activity is also more speculative.

During last week's holiday-shortened stretch, the buying of call options accounted for 47% of volume among the the smallest of traders, wrote SentimenTrader's Jason Goepfert in a Monday note. ""Sure, that's down from 55% in January but it's still higher than any other pre-2020 week in 20 years other than (barely) the peak in 2000,"" he said.

Buying call options gives investors the right to buy shares later at a specified price, giving them a profit should the price rises above the threshold before the contract expires. Buying put options, on the other hand, gives an investor the right to sell at a set price before the contract expires, offering protection in case the market falls below that level.

It doesn't look as if mom-and-pop investors are buying puts as an offset to their purchases of calls, wrote Goepfert. Purchases of calls by small investors exceed buying of puts by far wider margins than during past peaks. The gap is more than double its size in 2000, indicating a highly speculative market, where investors don't have enough protection on the downside.

A high ratio of calls to puts indicates retail investors are bullish on the market or whatever stocks they are betting on. But they could lose the cost of the options if their optimism proves unfounded.

It doesn't look like retail investors are moving to less aggressive strategies, such as selling calls, either. Among trades for 10 contracts or fewer executed last week, 59% more bullish options strategies were executed than bearish ones, according to Goepfert. Prior to the last six months, the only weeks that showed more aggressive behavior among small traders were during the peak of the tech-stock bubble in 2000, in October 2007, and a few weeks in January and February 2020.

""In many respects, small trader behavior is still more aggressive than many of the speculative fervors that popped up over the past 20 years, in the most leveraged instruments,"" wrote Goepfert. The speculative frenzy looks ""troubling,"" he said, raising the potential for losses among small investors, especially because the stock market keeps rising.

The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Monday and slipped 0.1% on Tuesday.

Still, there might be one piece of good news. Many small players have exited positions in many of the stocks pushed highest by the retail frenzy in January as prices have fallen in recent trading. ""There has been more churn in many of the most-exposed names,"" wrote Goepfert, ""So a rotation to more defensive positioning after the latest surge in speculative activity was beneficial.""

It remains to be seen whether the recent pullback in retail participation signifies a lasting decline, or a pause."

it's hard to convince john q public a gme share is actually worth this, and when they do their own research places like FINRA and others don't support your squeeze theory.

They have to go down a really deep hole to believe the FINRA numbers are wrong, especially with how the last squeeze went in January.

so people who believe in the squeeze have bought it, and the rest are just watching the graphs."

2021-04-07 09:36:00,wallstreetbets,"Retard here. Please respond.

How is it that PLTR volume is always so damn high, and yet price movement is so damn flat? I’m strongly “guessing” it’s because there’s an equal amount of buyers and sellers. Is it still the sell off of shares by long time holders, like company execs? The sentiment from retail investors is to buy and hold. So if it’s not retail doing the selling, and the sell offs aren’t predominantly still due to company execs and long time shareholder holders....and institutions haven’t bought in to a massive extent (to sell)...is the flat price movement due to options trading? 

And, Everytime I check, the volume of calls being bought far exceeds puts being bought...wouldn’t that make the price rise?


What am I missing. Be as much of an asshole as you want but can someone please lmk for real what the deal is? They had two massive new contracts recently. I’d expect it to go up a little and establish a new baseline, instead of going up slightly just to go back down slightly."

2021-04-07 14:03:56,wallstreetbets,"Some of you seem alright, so here is:

1. Diversify - no more than 20% into one play.
2. Test the waters - average cost down into a position (not always, but do this if not sure about a play).
3. Only play weeklies and 0dte if you know what's up. Otherwise stick to AT LEAST 1 month out expiry, or 2 month - for added safety (though reduced leverage, thus reduced potential gain and loss).
4. Buy ITM or ATM only. OTM options is why you always lose, even if you picked the direction right.
5. This is all just a game. If you're here to solve your financial problems - stop and talk to a professional financial advisor. This is 100% gambling. It's possible to get rich off this, but neither fast, nor guaranteed, nor easy. Slow and steady wins the race, so get a job to figure out your finances, and only gamble here with what you can afford to lose (duh!)."

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On March 23 the price of **SPY 6/18/21 $320** strike leap calls was **2.50**. Lets say we used $25k to buy 100 contracts and hold until expiration.

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the ask price of **87.40** which gives us a total value of:

#$874,000

No TA and no DD needed. Invest in a boring index **on a dip** and you can secure your retirement.

2021-04-07 06:54:09,wallstreetbets,"Futures are flat as of 0620. Nothing really doing in any major index. Europe and Asia not seeing much action either. This follows a day of small losses for stocks. Bonds are seeing some buying, with the 10-year yield down to 1.65%.

It’s a quiet period on Wall Street that will probably not change until earnings season kicks off for real next week. In the meantime there is ample time for pontification.

Fed meeting minutes will be released at 1400. That’s the major data release for today. There is the potential that something could be unearthed here that will spook markets, especially if it’s a debate about inflation. Probably none of that will matter in the long term. The Fed will raise rates when it is compelled to do so. Regardless of what is said, that decision will likely be a reaction to market activity rather than a shift in the dot plot.

We are supposed to get first quarter earnings from Carnival (NYSE:CCL), the cruise line operator. “Supposed to” because there is some conflicting information on when this company reports. Kind of hard to figure out. But when we do get it, the numbers should shed light on how leisure travel is shaping up. 

Just got a pretty enthusiastic economic call from Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Dimon has been right about these things before. He’s not a prognosticator by trade, which is one reason I tend to trust his forecasts more than most.

All else being equal there are reasons to believe the excess liquidity sloshing around the system will find its way to risk assets, specifically stocks, before too long. First quarter earnings could change that, but that will be the story for next week."

2021-04-07 07:08:03,wallstreetbets,"Quick Rant: 

Trading FX and commodities can be more profitable than options. (I trade options too). 

Reason: Cross correlations and Commodity currencies. 

Cross currency correlation:  If you know that GBP/USD is going up you can open long positions in GBP/CAD and GBP/JPY tripling your profits simultaneously. 

Commodity Currencies: If commodities like gold in Australia are going up, you can simultaneously hold long positions on Gold as well as AUS/USD since countries who’s currencies are connected to strong commodities have a positive correlation. 

It’s like killing 5 birds with one stone. Multiple profits with one play. (if you do it right)

It’s also the only market that’s open 24hrs a day, 5 days a week (asides from weekends) so you can trade pretty much anytime you want. 

Then you can re-invest most of your gains from trading currencies and commodities back into trading options or long term equity plays.

This is the way.

Sry just a rant, been a member before GME and bandwagon fans, and I also like trading options but it’d be nice to see FX and commodities trading get some more love on here too. :) 

Also, for BB shares, EoY target price $40 and $150+ in 3-5 years. good long term value investment with QNX + IVY + rise of EV market."

I am looking to make a big bet on LAD.  I believe they are going to blow out earnings beyond what Wall Street is estimating and they are a reopening play that is part of the current rotation.

The all time high is 417 and it is currently trading at 387 (up 4).  They release earnings on April 28.

Here is where I need help. 

Which options would you recommend for May that would yield the max profit assuming the stock goes to 420. I want to make to an outsized bet knowing the stock could blow past the all time highs and keep going.

My thinking is to  buy May 390 or 400.

Say you found out (hypothetically of course) that a massive financial company had a flaw in its software that could expose them to billions of dollars of risk. You found this out naturally as an end user using its software. You intend to make this knowledge public on WSB, as well as on other mediums.

Key points:
1. You discovered this flaw as an end user of their software (they have millions of end users)
2. It is not public knowledge yet
3. You are not employed by the company nor do you have friends/family at the company

The question: is it illegal to load up on puts prior to revealing the information? My thought is it is NOT illegal since that’s kinda what short research firms do with impunity."

2021-04-07 11:27:44,wallstreetbets,"I’m down too but I don’t think this keeps going on for much longer! Revenue estimates were lowered so APHA could hit them? I don’t understand the timing from Stifel, but if anything they made it easier for APHA, now with SweetWater Brewing, to beat the estimates. 

I strongly believe the price is being pushed down on purpose so institutions can load up on the cheap and by Friday will have covered most of their positions! 

No way this continues into Monday."

2021-04-07 08:01:09,wallstreetbets,"I love the BB stock also and owned it long before it was a meme stock and held it through the $28 high this year because $28 is a fraction of what this stock will be worth in the future. I don’t know about $40 this year or $150 in 3 years, but I like your optimism. I feel it will easily reach 10 times it current valuation of $8.99 per share in 3 years. Once the EV market settles in the sky is the limit for this stock! Also, BB has a patent sale in the works to unload patents they don’t require for their new fundamentals and that will be huge money. I think a lot of people will miss out if they aren’t buying this $8.99 sale, but that’s just my opinion. I see people losing out here everyday on stocks worth way more than $8.99 per share."

2021-04-07 09:26:00,wallstreetbets,"Idk what sort of question that is. Yes it is possible. Amazon was a boomer stock and if you got in at the right time you could retire if you invested enough. I would argue more people get an early retirement out of boomer stocks than the option and swing trade casino we have here. Don't get it twisted, this is a casino and the house always wins."
2021-04-07 09:30:13,wallstreetbets,"Assume you live for 40 years after retiring. You'd need about $2M to make it through. Now assume you have a job that allows you to save 20K a year. You'd need an annual rate of return of around 21%, and that's before taxes. Include cap gains and you're probably looking at 24-25% that you'd need. That's a very difficult proposition."

Phone sales in China were up >200% y/y for the month of Feb, iPhone shipments in the gulf countries were up >50% for the quarter, [Samsung last night said their Q1 profit likely up 44% and in line with estimates](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-results/samsung-electronics-says-q1-profit-likely-rose-44-matching-expectations-idUSKBN2BT33B) but the nugget in there is that they talk about phone sales.  AAPL is poised to destroy analyst estimates for revenue on the hardware side of things.  First 5G phone they've offered on top of wild demand for phones in general?

edit: [link to the China phone sales thing in this old comment, also noting massive massive open interest on June calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ma4qs1/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_march_22_2021/grrg3vx/), it was probably being shorted by some institution at 120 to get those calls filled cheap"

2021-04-07 16:35:41,wallstreetbets,"Ok so I trade spy like a hawk.
I can write w/o to many words and numbers:
we were last flat (volatile af flat at that) finishing our quad witching and end of month and end of q1 among a lot of other factors (political mostly).

So... once the 31st came, we shot up consistent. no volatility from last point of the 30th of march 396ish to 401 basically to end on the month. then april came and we reached 1.6% high to close under of course BUT. That is the point in which we closed today. at mondays high.

Stan Dev, and a bunch of other nonsensical math i do, among other setniment factors... show me that there is a high prob that we will get a bump ...becase
1) we are flat since mon
2) we actually went mostly up
3) volume has held
4)MM have stated we are going...but siad tech is staying down
5) and lastly we are tight with FTSE and HS is also at ATH.

no way are the other markets averages no leveling up with SPY.

Europe had its holidays for and missed 4 trading days and it has shot back up to catch up.

This is a hot potatoe thesis. no on wants to hold the bag so they keep rasing it. I believe we are going to be voliatile but must go higher. like the markets wants to go up....
Heres the fun part... If MM moving tech starts to finally grow some balls and push it (they have been dragging their feet).. then we are going this month I see some really high stuff in the coming days weeks."

The mods aren't a single collection either, but splinters of the core zjz... There is ""the board"" who exists to counter balance zjz, but they're pretty sketchy too and sometimes get infiltrated by zjz.  Most of the dream centered around dealing with their conflicts.  Turns out the entire board is also zjz....  The board also has a board that's comprised entirely of famous black actors.  This was the flaw in the AI.  He couldn't figure this out."

2021-04-07 16:28:03,wallstreetbets,"The way I see it, is new people aren’t the problem. If anything growth is great. 

The problem is that a lot of them came here United on something stupid premise that no one I know really believes in, Taking down hedge funds. 🥴

Markets grow best when everyone is making money in their own ways. It needs bears and bulls to hit on all cylinders. 

I feel like once the new people are divided on stonks again, it will force people to either go broke holding crap companies w/ no momentum or learn how to do it up right and then they’ll begin listening to the OG’s again.

2021-04-07 10:29:29,wallstreetbets,"Stay the fuck away from mortgages in the long run. Housing is in a bubble. Maybe less of one than might be otherwise apparent thanks to the shift towards work-from-home, but some of those buyers are going to get called back to the office and have to move again and some will realize they don't *want* to be where they bought. So you'll wind up with a glut of homes bringing down the market while a lot of mortgages still have very little equity. Won't get 2008 ugly, but it could still be quite the shock to the system."

2021-04-07 08:51:55,wallstreetbets,"sorta.  one thing on my mind is the analysts didn't put out updated price targets aside from UBS.  Every analyst has it rated as a Buy with price targets reflecting the october price of $12 (targeting growth to 24-30).  Now with full year FY21 and guidance for FY22 which hadn't been issued previously, they need to update their targets.

There are reasons to feel like it wont go to 60.  It has debt.  It probably wont sell gym equipment this way ever again.  But they have to catch up to DKS, which keeps going up and is not all the dissimilar from a financial perspective, albeit a better leverage ratio.

if all it does it catch up to the average pricing of the other sporting goods stores, it should get to 40.

and then the issue of the short interest, which it really shouldn't have."
2021-04-07 07:30:16,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah totally agree. I wouldn’t be buying in now after that run up.

My point was it’s actually valued fairly by r/investing metrics which is the complete opposite to AMC and GME which has a bat shit crazy valuation and them some."

2021-04-07 16:31:17,wallstreetbets,Yeah new people are not bad at all but the conspiracy theories are so mainstream now that I don’t know if that part of it will go away.

2021-04-07 16:45:43,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. I hear you. I got tired of following GME, listening to what they have to say or reading anything not in the daily. 

To OG’s credit, they have more solid discussions on stonks than what we currently have (from the little time I’ve spent there anyway). 

It’s just cuz the Apes just don’t wanna hear anything non-gme, amc, bb or nok around here and they GREATLY outnumber us. 

It really sucks as I’m sure everyone is fully aware here and it’s like just talking to a wall. 

I mean, I had people trying to ban me for using the term retard. 😬"

And they were just fucking w/ you man. Generally people only fuck w/ people they like. I mean, how many times did my flair get fucked with here the last couple weeks?  

I popped over there when you were riding them and they changed Trens flair to something he hates too. And he lives on that site. I’m sure it’ll get changed back. 

For me, I know they aren’t there because of us, it’s cuz of the Apes. 
When Apes 1st came I went through stages of anger, lashing out, depression the site was fucked, and then acceptance.

I think I got banned 2 or 3 times for riding apes amd lost thousands of Karma. Worth it though."

He was always using the friend group for validation which I found annoying as fuck. One day he posted on reddit for validation and I commented something pretty fucking gnarly. Got back to him quick and he blew up. It ended with me writing him an apology email and him never responding.

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Interesting, and amusing news about NIO Hey again everyone, 

So there's been some interesting news surrounding NIO again; and NIOgang, while we're busy in our day to day lives and jobs, we've always got our finger on the pulse for NIO; or at least trying to, haha.

So we know that NIO's sales in Q1 were very impressive--hitting 20,060--[link](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-provides-march-and-first-quarter-2021); increasing 423% year-on-year. At the time this information was released, which was the 1st of April 2020, NIO's cumulative deliveries were 95,701--we've subsequently just learned, as of now, that NIO's 100,000th EV has come off the production line; here a [link](https://twitter.com/42how_/status/1379634663652663299) to see.

I recently learned that NIO is comparing in China very well against the European premium brands Audi, BMW, and Mercedes; here's a [link](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377567655813644290/photo/1). As you can see, NIO is doing **considerably better**; this comes courtesy of Marcel Münch--an analyst I sometimes listen to on youtube on my break. Additionally, NIO is even doing considerably better than VW in China--[link](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377634756490366984) to see that too.

So demand is getting stronger for NIO; and as we know from the last earnings call from the Q4 and full year financials, NIO will be increasing production to around 300-600k in early 2022.

Sales are increasing; revenue is increasing. Oh, also, another thing is that NIO signed a deal with the German retail giant Metro AG; here a [link](https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/29/nio-signs-deal-with-german-retail-giant-on-charging-infrastructure-partnership/). Why this is exciting is because we know NIO is planning on European expansion soon, and an infrastructure agreement with one Germany's biggest retailers with over 600 stores, seems like another big hint what's coming for NIO.

Where does amusement come in? That's right, you guessed it: Jim Cramer.

Jim in on twitter claiming that the current chart shows NIO may go down; here's [link](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1379576154810691593). And the price you wonder it supposedly will go? That's right, Citrons price target. Of course, what's interesting here is when we look at the comment section of Cramer's post; some of my favorites are [1](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379590047503065088), [2](https://twitter.com/ajosephb/status/1379627925868212224), [3](https://twitter.com/Dave15161498/status/1379579270465486853), and [4](https://twitter.com/j04776684/status/1379579589568180226), it seems like the tactic used isn't working. In fact I think it's pretty clear that the suits are trying to manipulate NIO's price by trying to effect sentiment--similar to the same tactics used against GME; and from the comments I linked you all to, I don't think it's going to work. What's also funny, is that Cramer was saying months ago how we was wrong about NIO; his flip-flopping is suspicious, at least to me.

Oh also, I just saw this a minute ago, that William Li Bin, CEO of NIO, has said in a recent interview commemorating the 100,000th EV produced, that he is confident that NIO will exceed 1,000,000 EV saes in China; here the [link](https://twitter.com/Klp168/status/1379667417928933376).

Personally I think we'll see NIO go much higher in the future; we know that institutions are [buying](https://twitter.com/NinjaSwinga/status/1379586316795543553) NIO, and I remain very bullish for them. They've really come a long way since I first was interested in them almost 2 years ago now; I work in the health care industry, and I'm confident that NIO will free me, eventually--my hands are made of diamond too!

I just spend my break writing this, so hopefully it helps some of you remain strong.

NIO all the way.

And I can like this stock, and hate their government, in the exact same way I like Tesla, and hate my government!

Thanks everyone.

Edit\* I put 427% rather than the correct number 423%

Edit 2\* HAHA I just looked found out that Jim Cramer deleted his bearish tweet about NIO; here's a few links for proof [1](https://stocktwits.com/liudasbar/message/312761193), [2](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379776807520542721)"

2021-04-07 17:45:20,wallstreetbets,"I’m torn between getting involved in either NIO or XPENG. Then I think to myself, they tend to move in tandem and perhaps the gains difference won’t be too exceptional? So why not just play them both? They strike me as the Chinese “luxury” and “economy” EV options. 

TLDR: I should probably stop trying to pick sides between XPENG and NIO and just play em both"
2021-04-07 16:45:14,wallstreetbets,"Don’t count on NIO breaking the bank by opening shops in Europe.

Europeans don’t like Chinese cars at all and all previous attempts have failed.
Someone who has the cash to buy an EV and is now driving a Tesla/VW/Benz/BMW will not ever switch to a Chinese brand.

People with no money to buy them will just get the beforementioned brands in the 2nd hand market."

He decided against it because he entered the EV space first, he’s been the trailblazer and now he’s being replaced. The main drawback of EV’s is the their range and charge time, nio has greater range and solves the charge time with its battery replacement service which is faster than refuelling gas cars. In China people don’t have space to install their own charging plugs at home hence why the swapping is a necessity. Nio will never be as big as Tesla but it has a much higher chance of its stock price going 10x than Tesla’s... 🤫"
2021-04-07 08:39:58,wallstreetbets,"They're backed by the Chinese government smart guy.

Except that TSLA 5:1 split within the past year, so it's really the equivalent of when TSLA was at $300 pre split price. Is NIO as reliable and established as TSLA was 1 year ago?"
2021-04-07 13:08:44,wallstreetbets,"You do realize if NIO 10x, it's worth about as much as TSLA right now, which is about 5x more than TSLA should be actually worth on fundamentals."
2021-04-07 09:00:02,wallstreetbets,"Wowwwww THAT IS NEWS TO ME!!!! IMO he decided against swapping because of all the batteries (most expensive part of the car!!) laying around in the charging stations. ( There are vids on YT where you can see that TESLA had this idea 💡!!!) 
The fact of the Chinese people not having a good possibility of “home-charging” is a VERY GOOD POINT!!! THX, I will keep that in mind !!!
Pls give me a link where I can see that ELON MUSK is being replaced.... !!
I don’t see TESLA as a car company; as I do with NIO; therefore NIO WILL NEVER ARRIVE AT THE SAME POINT AS TESLA (FSD, ENERGY, etc)"

Tesla will hit $1 trillion market cap with ease by 2022 but that’s only a 40% gain from here.

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Paysafe: The biggest FinTech you’ve never heard of! Why one day this could de-throne even SQ and PYPL. •••Not financial advice, do your own DD, invest at your own risk!•••

I’ll keep it short and sweet. Paysafe just went public through a reverse merger SPAC, and has been trading on the NYSE for less than a week. This is like getting in bed with Square at $15/share.

Here are 8 reasons to believe🙌:

1. Bill Foley is behind the merger. The man is a legend in Financial Services and has a strong history of value creation, having led five separate multibillion-dollar public market platforms that completed over 100 acquisitions. Think Fidelity National Financial, Fidelity Information Services, Black Knight Financial, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Ceridian. You know, small companies. 🤪📈💰

2. Founded in 1996, Paysafe is a leading global payments provider focused on digital commerce and iGaming transactions. The global online gambling market size was valued at USD 53.7 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5% from 2020 to 2027. 📈

3. Paysafe holds the No. 2 market share position in the global digital wallet market. The company’s digital wallet is in over 120 markets and has customers like DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ: DKNG) and William Hill. The company has 3.8 million active users for its digital wallet segment.

4. Paysafe is No. 1 in the iGaming eCash network segment. Customers for this segment include Fortnite, Twitch and Spotify Technologies (NYSE: SPOT).

5. The company estimates that its 2021 payment volume will hit $103 billion. 💰💰💰Billion with a B! Revenue of $1.5 billion is estimated for fiscal 2021. Paysafe said revenue will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 11% from 2020 to 2023.

6. The digital wallet segment is expected to have $441 million in revenue for 2021 with a 1.9% take on transactions. This represents 29% of the company’s 2021 revenue.

7. The eCash segment has 12 million active users and $5 billion in payment volume. This segment has a take of 6.8% and is expected to have 2021 revenue of $318 million.

8. The integrated processing segment has over $75 billion in payment volume and a 1% take. This segment is expected to have revenue of $764 million in fiscal 2021, representing 50% of the company’s total.

Mind you THIS IS NOT A STARTUP! It’s a profitable company with a proven track record, robust sales and a lucrative Total Addressable Market within reach. It’s a long term hold for sure, but with the core drivers outlined above I’m confident we’ll see this as a 10x bagger in less than 5 years. 💎🚀💰🙌📈

Edit: For people that don’t know that much about PE: PE investors value “IRR” (internal rate of return) more than “MOIC” (multiple on invested capital). They also value getting money back. Blackstone will sell a portion of their stake this year. For sure. Maybe not “all” of their gains. 
Also for the stock’s long term prospects Blackstone and CVC need to sell some of their stakes. Institutional investors don’t like it when there’s a big overhang from PE."

Cash app makes square people's smart phone their wallet. 

And also functions as their checking, and brokerage accounts with their stock purchasing and paycheck direct deposit options respectively.

In short, cash app already has its broader audience, and is in their pockets. What barrier to entry is there for Square if they decide to try their hand in the revenue sources you outlined?

PSFE is positioned to leverage multiple high growth verticals that SQ has yet to touch....iGaming/Video Gaming/Sports Betting being the key competitive driver for them. $3.4B TAM in 2019 --> $47B in 2025?  And they're already No. 1 in the iGaming eCash network segment? Yes please.
2021-04-07 14:23:15,wallstreetbets,"Yes not Stripe but interesting comparison. Through funding rounds, Stripe was recently valued at 52.8X EV/Rev.  If you applied that multiple to Paysafe, it would be worth $110.  That's nearly 8x profit from here."
2021-04-07 08:49:28,wallstreetbets,"exactly. aside from laudering money, cashing out on scams, and stealing mom's credit card for skin, paysafe isn't that useful"

2021-04-07 14:29:16,wallstreetbets,That's actually average for the sector. Shift4 reported only 4% y-o-y growth. Fisv projects 5%. The real growth with be inorganic through M&A and organic through expansion of US iGaming.  They've deliberately left that out of their projections to be conservative. Foley is known for underpromising and overperforming.
2021-04-07 12:50:06,wallstreetbets,Indeed!

2021-04-07 03:43:05,wallstreetbets,"They’ve signaled that they’re staying on:
Eli Nagler, a Senior Managing Director at Blackstone, just said: “We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.”  
 
Regarding Blackstone and CVC, who now have four senior managing directors on Paysafe’s Board, Foley said, “They rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn’t take all their money off the table… All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.”"

2021-04-07 12:49:41,wallstreetbets,My pleasure. I wish I had gotten in with SQ at the ground floor and kick myself in the pants everyday for not doing so. I see PSFE as being severely undervalued for what the future holds.

2021-04-07 13:49:23,wallstreetbets,"PSFE has marginally higher debt-to-asset ratio than SQ. This is primarily a result of Pi UK Bidco Limited and iPayment Holdings acquisitions in 2017/2018 respectively. 

SQ - $3.4B debt to $9.8B assets = 35% Degree of Leverage  
PSFE - $3.2B debt to $7.4B assets = 43% DoL

Not too worried about it now that they're public again with a massive injection of capital."

But SQ only operates in United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, United Kingdom at the present. PSFE is global in 120+ markets.  And they already have a network of digital wallet solutions that enable users to upload, store, withdraw & pay funds from a virtual account."
2021-04-07 14:38:06,wallstreetbets,Depends on the brokerage. I'm using PSFE/WS. Could be PSFE+ or PSFE.WT or some other variation.

I was digging through all the news sources I could find on $PSFE to see why they had a negative EPS and couldn't find anything definitive, even looked at their 20-F filing and saw only vague mentions of unspecified expenses.

2021-04-07 04:05:21,wallstreetbets,Actually very low debt to equity ratio.
2021-04-07 07:55:16,wallstreetbets,"I mean they actually don’t, since PayPal actually makes money. More profitable at Gross Margin level but their adjusted EBITDA is non GAAP so you gotta make the same adjustments if you wanna compare apples to apples. 

PayPal is also growing faster lmao, as a 21bn revenue company"

The stats show that ‘muricans are more likely to bet on sport than Brits. They also bet much larger amounts. Since gambling was liberalised here, several companies have grown into absolute titans. See bet365 and flutter (Betfair/paddy power), who must be US acquisition targets. Look at how popular your fantasy sports are! I don’t know if this company will do well, but sports betting in the US will be gigantic"

 It's a single fee for the transaction with vanguard (I'm #old) no additional fee for it being a conversion."
2021-04-07 03:52:04,wallstreetbets,"Don’t think they will. In “FTAC’s Board of Directors’ Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination”, they state: “Commitment of Paysafe’s Owners.

2021-04-07 09:08:12,wallstreetbets,"Not really. People gamble on sports regardless of wether they are attending the event. In the uk, you can bet on any sport, anytime, on your phone. The US will go that way, there is so much money and tax to be made."

2021-04-07 13:01:35,wallstreetbets,Do yanks not all bet on their phones when watching sports? How does that work? It's obviously massive in the UK but I'd assumed it would be just as big in America

2021-04-07 18:02:03,wallstreetbets,Selling $15 puts at different maturities on this one has been very profitable so far. Intraday volatility is so high that is relatively easy to sell when the price is in the 13-13.5 range and closing when is in the 14-14.5 range. You benefit from delta and theta.
2021-04-07 07:59:41,wallstreetbets,Yup. Increasing EBITDA margins going forward
2021-04-07 08:08:24,wallstreetbets,"Yeah sorry the fact that they are the market leader, profitable, and growing faster than their competitors which are 20x smaller shouldn’t factor into the valuation.

2021-04-07 07:59:04,wallstreetbets,Hard to tell these days tbh!
2021-04-07 08:19:43,wallstreetbets,No they are not. That’s true. Sector peer valuations matter nonetheless. EV/EBITDA and EV/rev comps across 10 top fintechs puts Paysafe comfortably in the $40’s but first it’ll go to mid $20’s with audited numbers. Announcements of M&A plans will take it higher from there. Foley has grown five companies 5x to 14x through successful M&A execution and he’s said that’s his plan with PaySafe. He actually said it is more in line with FIS which he grew 91x. His track record is proven.

2021-04-07 10:43:45,wallstreetbets,Too early to say. A few days ago they said M&A plans were already in the works but they didn’t offer specifics.
2021-04-07 09:31:48,wallstreetbets,Thinking the pandemic is over is a risky way of thinking
2021-04-07 10:01:38,wallstreetbets,"it’s far from *over*, but I think we’ve reached a point where sports taking place without crowds is viewed as a relatively innocent event, even back at the peak of COVID. people continue to gamble at a high rate even if they can’t attend the event in person, in my experience. most of the gamblers I know usually *don’t* attend the event live, as the gambling itself is often a way to make a rather boring night spent on your couch watching the game on TV much more interesting."
2021-04-07 11:02:34,wallstreetbets,"My original comment was in reference to the statement of ""what does the pandemic have to do with sports?"". While it does look like the pandemic is winding down, there are still a lot of unknowns about it. Just because some vaccines are out doesn't mean we are out of the woods. It's probably a safe bet that sports will thrive going forward, but hell,  Melvin capital thought shorting GME was a safe bet too. 🤷‍♂️"

These cunts just moved to different firms, no penalties....it was the opposite, they got fucking payouts and continue fucking people over to this day."
2021-04-07 02:39:19,wallstreetbets,">Guggenheim Investments Chairman Scott Minerd said it’s only a matter of time before another firm implodes in a manner similar to Bill Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management.


>“It is highly likely that we are going to have another situation like that,” Minerd said Monday in a Bloomberg Television interview. Major losses, such as those incurred by Archegos, “tend to continue to cascade until the market corrects and flushes the risk out of the system,” he said.


>Archegos, Hwang’s family office, sent tremors through financial markets in recent weeks as banks liquidated $20 billion of positions linked to the firm. The forced sales -- marking one of the biggest margin calls ever -- included shares of ViacomCBS Inc., GSX Techedu Inc. and Discovery Inc. Lenders including Nomura Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG said they may face significant losses as a result.


>The episode underscores the impact one obscure firm can have on the rest of Wall Street. It has also spurred a reckoning over how Archegos, as a private entity, was able to place outsize wagers using derivatives while remaining shielded from the disclosures required of most investors. The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened a preliminary investigation into Hwang’s leveraged trades.


>“I just see us as being very, very vulnerable to something coming out of the blue that nobody is really anticipating,” Minerd said.
More oversight may be coming for family offices, he said. The market for special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, could also become an area of inquiry for regulators in cases where earnings projections don’t measure up to results, Minerd said."

What you did was extremely naughty. This is the second time you've done this and we are very upset. You are officially in time out. We're taking away your Nintendo Switch and you will not be getting your allowance this month or next!

2021-04-07 15:42:32,wallstreetbets,"> Can you get margin called on long positions?

Yes, if it is in a margin account. These companies just use a high leverage on trades that ""can't go wrong"", until they do. 

For example, the hedge fund might bet that no stock goes down more than 9 days in a row with an extremely high leverage and quite possibly no stock has gone down more than 9 days in a row. Then it happens, and their whole portfolio is wiped out. Ultimately, the hedge fund might have a complex structure, quite possibly designed with insider's knowledge how to make it impossible to quantify the risk, and at the end of the day it just comes down to having found one of those infinite leverage bugs like in Robinhood, but then with a bank like Credit Suisse. Same shit, slightly better suits. 

For banks there is no real reason to support such stupid ideas, but for the sales divisions at banks there is, because they typically get bonuses for exposing the bank to risk (crazy, I know)."
2021-04-07 08:26:35,wallstreetbets,"I mean, Nomura basically admitted that they had shitty risk control and had no exit strategy. MS/GS both did the same play and came out unscathed. Wouldn't you hold it against them for allowing someone to cost their company billions."

2021-04-07 04:48:24,wallstreetbets,401K’s are individual retirement accounts (defined contribution plan for normal people) where people mainly just own a bunch of mutual and index funds.

They are pretty strict protocols on those two halves of the banks mixing. The banking side’s job was to price and sell the secondary offering - they make revenue on the fees from just doing so. Usually the funds involved in offerings are very different than those interacting with the hedge funds that got dumped on and have very different objectives.

2021-04-07 17:50:24,wallstreetbets,"Essentially, Morgan scammed a few hedge funds.
The bank called them offering to sell Viacom stock af a discount. What the bank didn’t disclose was that it was planning to sell a lot more of the same stock on the market right after, which would cause its price to tank.

In other words, a typical scenario where the bank, to protect itself, tries to sell to its clients the crap it owns and knows it’s about to implode. It’s not uncommon.

Archegos didn’t own the stock directly, to begin with. Archegos bought exposition to the stock thru legeraged derivative contracts. The banks which sold those contracts, on the other hand, had to buy lots of the underlining stock to hedge their risk.
So when the contracts were closed because Archegos couldn’t provide more margin, the banks found themselves owners of a lot of stock they didn’t need anymore, and didn’t want. And they looked for a way to dump it."
2021-04-07 13:52:02,wallstreetbets,"Nope. Essentially what this guy did is borrowed money from the banks to buy more stock, without the other banks knowing. When Viacom stock started tanking, the banks thought this guy would still have enough money to pay them back, until they realized that he did this with a ton of banks.

Each bank is allowed to take back the money they lended to the guy whenever they want (or take the stock and immediately sell it off in this case). Now the banks could have said, ""it's in all our best interests to sell off slowly, together"", but if Morgan Stanley thinks, ""no it's not, this is a sinking ship, staying on longer is just gonna cause us more pain"" they are totally within their rights to dump all their stock immediately.

As for who they sold the stocks to, Morgan Stanley doesn't need to tell them everything they know. Knowing that another bank holds the same position as you isn't insider trading.

Yeah, it's a shitty move to do to keep things quiet, but the funds that bought from Morgan Stanley know that when they all of a sudden say, ""you want to buy billions in stock, for 10% off, tonight"" that shit is fucked. It's their job to assess whether the risk is worth it (and a lot of them made money because some stocks didn't drop as much as expected, or at least not immediately)."

2021-04-07 18:30:11,wallstreetbets,"This isn’t about the stock offering.

The bank owned Viacom and other stocks as a hedge for the contracts it had with Archegos. Once those contracts were abruptly called off, that “hedge” became a huge long position.
They didn’t want it, they knew it was going to collapse in price (because they didn’t want it and they were going to dump it), and they looked for suckers who would buy some of it off them before dumping the rest.
Some hedge funds took the bait.

“Hello, would you like to buy some Viacom stock at a discount? We happen to have some from a client”.
What the bank didn’t mention to the prospective buyers was that it had a lot more Viacom in stock than it was selling to them. And it didn’t mention that it was planning to dump it, either. Because, you know, if their clients knew the whole story they wouldn’t have bought it. And then it could have turned into a loss for the bank.

Moral of the story: if you are a big bank and own some security you know it’s about to implode, you call some clients and try to sell it to them. After all, a bank’s priority is to make money for itself, not for its clients."
2021-04-07 17:06:29,wallstreetbets,Because eventually people can start being kicked out of their homes in a few months who haven’t been paying and those who have been wanting to sell will start unloading once the vaccine rollout is finished increasing supply since they’re no longer hunkering down.
2021-04-07 15:00:44,wallstreetbets,"Right, but what makes it privileged info for the bank itself? If individual employees of the bank sold off their personal holdings beforehand, then sure that would likely be insider trading.



But here, the bank itself is the one doing the selling. It was handed a pile of assets that it needed to liquidate, along with a bunch of other banks. There's no obligation to the other banks to not start selling before the others do.

 And the bank doesn't have to announce it's own sell off/how big it is before it starts obviously, that would be an absurd requirement.

I just don't see where you're coming from. It seems to me like you're saying that it's insider trading because the bank knew about its own sell off before it happened, but I'm pretty sure that's *not* what you're trying to say because that would be absurd."

Yet they need to get greedy and and push their activities and take these absurd type of risks.

I think your opinion is entirely lacking in nuance.   It is somewhat the bank's fault if they make a risky loan. It is somewhat the borrower's fault if they sign an ARM that will force a foreclosure.  But banks got off of being responsible in 2008, even getting bailed out, while normal people lost the mortgage, even when they didn't deserve it.  My dad didn't sign an ARM that was a stupid value, he bought a modest house at the wrong time and exhausted his savings over 2 years of unemployment.  But the banks who signed predatory loans, ones they knew couldn't be sustained by their borrowers, got bailed out.  That simply isn't right."

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Improving as a trader So what do you guys do to improve your trading game?  I've been using a notebook and keeping track of my trades and writing down what worked and what didn't, as well as coming up with rules to follow to stop myself from repeating mistakes I see more than once.

For example, I've discovered that my biggest weakness is that my prime animal isn't a bear or a bull, it's a pig.  I've missed the direction of a trade exactly three times in the last year, but I've lost money on dozens of trades that I went from green to red on because I refused to accept that the top was in.  This had led to realized losses of over $7k - small potatoes to some of  you, big potatoes to others.  And remember, at one point, I was up on basically every single one of those trades, so the losses counting unrealized and never taken gains are much, much worse.

 I've realized the reason for this is that while the trade is still open, I feel like I'm proving to myself and the world that I'm smart enough to figure out something, and closing the trade by taking profit means I've given up on my idea or admitted it's wrong - nonsensical, I know, but you've got to figure out why you're doing foolish behaviors if you want to stop them.

Since then I've started to set stop sales and it's really helped me to take profits and improve my skills (and portfolio), because once I'm no longer emotionally invested in being ""right"" as I've already taken profit I can much more easily analyze how the equity or trend is doing going forwards, and whether or not it's something I'm happy staying out of or if I want to get back into it at the current price.

My next step is figuring out when to abandon losing positions instead of riding them to zero and starting to make successful hedges on my positions.

How about you?  What are your biggest weaknesses and how are you working to address them and improve?  Share and help the class, we're all trying to make money here, and we're all admitted idiots using fake names, plus it's unlikely your fuckups will be worse than the embarrassing shit I've already posted."

Keep any one position under 10% of your portfolio. Always do some DD on a company or stock after it’s suggested, even if that’s only looking at the growth charts and patterns of how it trades.

I mainly want to see that a company is actually profitable instead of losing money. I also look at the Current Ratio which shows their ability to pay off short term debts. If the current ratio is 1.5 it means their current assets can cover their current debt 1.5 times. Current Ratio under 1 means they can’t cover all of their debt so they may be at risk of going bankrupt.

The exact amount and quick. Kept making foolish bets after foolish bet based on the potential of earning, and not actually making rational calculations. Thankfully, I took a break and got perspective. I'm now patient, and I observe the market to see opportunities present themselves and act. Now I'm up 24k.

One suggestion I've seen that can help new traders, don't ever put more than 5% of your account's value into a trade. Trading isn't about finding big wins, it's about avoiding big losses while waiting for big wins to show up.

Also, consider not trading. 80% of traders don't beat the market. Buying SPY and holding it for years, as boomer as it sounds, is one of the best ways to make money. Combine that with selling covered calls. Which can both serve as a good exit strategy and decent passive income.

If you buy a company that has good balance sheets and stable income, in the long run, it's a guarantee to work yourself out of a losing position. Something like WFC is never going to be allowed to go bankrupt and has a low stock price. Start by buying 100 shares, and selling weekly or monthly covered calls.

I generally aim if the price drops 10% to 20% as my ""average down"" point. Where I'll buy more to lower my average cost so that my covered calls can still print, but won't be netting me a loss if they get assigned."

But at the very least, they will help me screen out the dog shit and do the most basic DD for me to use as a starting point for idea generation.

Made a bunch of money on GME in March.  Then lost 20% of it because I was buying everything high.  Managed to get out as Nasdaq corrected down 10%.  But I had been watching all that shit.

When MU was around 80, LRCX was 550, AMAT 95... I bought a shit ton of calls cheap as fuck.  Same thing with the BB dip and cruise lines.

Then as it went up I started taking profits.

Do not FOMO !

Do not be greedy !

(there is always that thought in the back of your head - it could go a little higher, and a little higher, … DON'T ! Just sell when you have a comfortable profit and move on)  


Do not trade with EMOTIONS or SENTIMENT only by numbers!

&#x200B;

Use a good charting solution (I like TradingView premium) and learn it inside out.  
Make extensive use of alarms to be alerted on sudden price movements (TradingView is absolutely fantastic as it has extensive charting tools that let you draw patterns around stock movement and set alarms when the price movement leaves a pattern so you can let certain stocks run on ""auto pilot"" while you work elsewhere).  
Always have a good idea where your portfolio is at and what your positions look like BEFORE trading starts.  
Be prepared BEFORE trading starts.  
Don't believe the media (if there is a #1 takeaway from following recent events on WSB it has proven strongly that the media is full of shit and you absolutely have to make your own DD).  
Always make a plan for the day - which positions you plan to sell, which to load up on, which stocks to look into, ideas for trading games, ...  
Then follow through on your plans.  
Use margin for short term leverage or quick moves before cash clears on accounts but NEVER GET SQUEEZED into the corner of margin call!  
Always have ""play money"" on reserve to make quick day trades or react to an opportunity.  
Do not lock up all funds in ""dead stocks"" that just sit there forever and you hoping for the stock to ""recover""

If you managed to identified your own thought patterns, you probably have the analytical mind to identify the market one. And stay humble so that you don't lose that skill to conceit.**

For the record, my biggest mistake is that I never manage to imagine the stock i'm holding will go up another 10-20% for the day/week. *It's already so overpriced....surely people won't be dumb enough to b... And it's gone up another 20%*. The real issue is when you dissuade yourself from holding it in the first place."

2021-04-07 07:30:17,wallstreetbets,"If I sold GME at 100% profit I’d be crying at the missed opportunity. Percentages are relative anyway, it’s a better idea of having a price target based on market cap and inherent volatility."
2021-04-07 11:39:45,wallstreetbets,"I've been revisiting my thesis at 15%, 50%, and 100% gains. At 100% gains I usually sell 50% and play with the house's money. Set price alerts."
2021-04-07 08:47:49,wallstreetbets,What's a weekly
2021-04-07 01:07:54,wallstreetbets,"When something is up a chunk like that start watching for volume to decrease and the candles getting short, usually that’s when the market sentiment is about to shift. That’s when I grab the nearest put and let it ride for half an hour to see if I can get some quick gains if I haven’t burnt my day trades for the week. If something is close to closing way the fuck up (or down) for no other reason than Reddit memes or panic selling, it’s probably headed the other way the next day, so I do the same thing (not yolo unless I’m 100% sure on checking all my boxes, which is almost never) before the close so I don’t get fucked in the opening scramble. I lost out on RKT by missing the options at close the day before it shot to the moon and missed the puts on it because I was hella busy at work, and both those trades would’ve made me a couple bags. Lesson learned, tell the customers to fuck off for a minute."

2021-04-06 22:51:15,wallstreetbets,"I'll look at technicals for confirmation or warning signs, but I don't trade on them.  My thesis for any trade depends, but I usually try to boil it down to a single sentence theory. 

For example, I'm currently working out the hedging on going all in on Oil calls for this summer with VIX and DRIP calls to hedge.  Thesis is simple ""COVID is over, people want to go the fuck outside and spend money, that equals more oil use""

Then I've been doing a ton of research and DD to figure out if I'm right or if there is enough loose supply to cover the gap between surging demand and production/distribution lag.  Even with the OPEC+ meeting tossing another 2 million BPD on the market in June, I don't think there's close to enough supply on the market.

I personally think oil is hitting $100 at some point this year, but I'm setting up the trade to break even at $70 and profit at $80.  I'll post my first DD on it when everything is ready. 

A previous example that worked out was ""the storm in Texas fucked some power companies hard on secondary market buys, short them""."

2021-04-07 09:43:10,wallstreetbets,"Strategy for people hoping to make as much as possible as quickly as possible.  Having the highest amount of capital to put into your next trade which might make you 100% in a few days is better in their eyes than holding an underwater investment potentially for years until it rights itself.  It depends on what your goals are I suppose.  I try not to throw all my eggs into one basket and I usually believe on some level in the company I'm investing in, so I don't mind holding when things go south as long as I believe they will bounce back eventually.  It's not a loss until you sell.

Edit:  Also WSB has traditionally been about options.  Selling when 50% down on options is definitely a solid play if you're within a week or two of expiration since it's more likely than not to continue down to expiring worthless at that point."

2021-04-07 00:08:43,wallstreetbets,"Depends on the strategy. I tend to mix a fixed risk and unfixed strategy for options. I rarely go naked, has made a huge difference. I also go play binary events like dividends and earnings. For stock, I look for growth and value stocks.

What's worked best for me is sticking to things I understood. If I could understand how they make money, and kinda visualize their business plan, I check into them. You do this because you have to understand potential flaws that can fuck things up. Like right now, we have a chip shortage, this hurts many tech companies.

I go by basic fundamentals and check financials, and balance sheet. If the money is whack, stay away. I then check tech specs and try to just find an entry point. For options, I usd IV Rank and IV. For buying stock at a good price, RSI and EMA/SMA, and patience. Watch for a moment, it'll kinda be obvious when you see it if you've been watching it for a little while. Things tend to line up.

Sounds boring, but honestly consistency has been my friend."

2021-04-07 16:14:49,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, buying more GME. Ooooh oooh ahh ahh"
2021-04-06 23:24:12,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I’m all about the technicals and odds. I figure market makers don’t have the time to research each individual company, but they can use technicals to drive shares profitably. I would rather replicate what market makers do(can also be watched on t2 data) and attempt to replicate them. Apparently what I attempt to do is considered voodoo in the industry(someone with an alleged PhD told me that).         

Does your investment thesis include what happens if it trades completely sideways? Timing is key.. How much do you know about the theta curve? How far is your timing on your calls and puts? Do you aim for a set of Greeks or do you go by feel? What kind of options do you buy?        

Here is my thesis: the stock market is a Ponzi scheme. It is also a Ponzi scheme that people are stupid not to get involved in and also stupid to get involved in(depending on opinion). Given that, I feel that the stock market is made for the billionaires to screw over the average person which is why you see something like a 90% washout rate in traders and investors.       

Puts>shorts. You can’t get squeezed by buying puts. Look at any bankrupt company and a lot of them squeeze prior to bankruptcy.     

Are you sure you don’t want to go long-short within the same industry? The aim of a long-short portfolio isnt to win on the hedge and the long position, but to make either the hedge or the long profitable. You will often see funds and some institutions(citadel) buying puts, then buying calls, and finally driving prices by filling in shares. Trying to find a profitable hedge within the same industry can pay dividends, especially when investing based around events or catalysts."
2021-04-06 23:11:21,wallstreetbets,"Imo, I don’t think we see oil breaking the $70 mark this year. OPEC+ is still sitting on about 7mbo/day that can enter the market when they want. I think this will keep prices in check as long as the US doesn’t go bat-shit crazy and bring out another 500 rigs. Which I don’t think they will as all E&P companies are trying to work off of FCF and production growth is not the main driver for probably the next 18-24 months. 
The industry will continue to consolidate using equity deals as big cash deals are not in favor. 
I agree people want to travel and you will see demand increase from 2020 levels and oil stocks should appreciate. I missed the MTDR run and kick myself daily for not getting in at $2.25...🤦‍♂️
Currently not holding oil stocks but recently exited $PE & $FANG and am looking for a new entry point on a couple. 

Best of luck."

$477,186.19 YOLO on GME. I figure short term has the potential for tremendous upside, long term is not looking so bad either. This is kinda of a continuous YOLO and I just keep buying the dip, the rise and when trading sideways, I buy out of boredom."

GME is not worth 0 (aka instant noodles). It's more than 40$ (that's certain I hope with the recent changes).

It's more than 120$ (that's the LOWEST with WILD support).

So what downside? It's lambos or teslas."

2021-04-06 22:08:52,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the calls and some shares were bought in Jan. YOLOs tend to be all at once, but I feel I was pretty clear this is an ongoing addiction."

2021-04-07 01:00:46,wallstreetbets,He bought them in January when IV was insane. Super OTM strikes went for tens of thousands of dollars.

2021-04-07 11:30:37,wallstreetbets,That confused me too.  He must have bought the lower Call after a big dip.
2021-04-07 08:27:40,wallstreetbets,"I’ll be honest, the DD seemed solid at the first spike but with much less supporting data points. It was the sense of community, that a single ape with a single share (or even fractional) can not only make a difference, but have a difference made in their life.

2021-04-06 21:56:01,wallstreetbets,These are all wishful thinking at this point. Chewy for gaming is nothing special. It's just another Newegg or CompUSA in the past. GS needs to do better than that.
2021-04-07 13:26:53,wallstreetbets,"Ha ha.  Sure dude, whatever you say!  I’m sure your 60 days of stonks trading couldn’t possibly be wrong.

Just a little hint for you, since you’re new at this: 
You wouldn’t exercise the option in that scenario, you’d sell it."
2021-04-06 22:45:17,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-07 09:17:01,wallstreetbets,"That is the crux of the problem, MOASS is imminent but no one knows when it will occur or how violent it will be. In probably every other situation in which you one had a bunch of shares, writing covered calls would be the way to go."

2021-04-06 21:18:36,wallstreetbets,"Why buy the option and not shares? For 21,545 you could have bought 116 shares at the market rate. Do options really print that hard?"
2021-04-06 23:42:29,wallstreetbets,"While I understand you like the leverage if this prints, for $20,000 you could have just bought shares.  At least you only paid for one."

2021-04-06 21:37:56,wallstreetbets,"Well when it moons I’m hoping the IV goes even higher, but honestly not sure if that’s how it works. Most likely I got screwed."
2021-04-07 00:00:40,wallstreetbets,Not yet. I sold similar strikes that expired a couple weeks ago and it was great. I would not sell them in 2023 though. Not yet at least.
2021-04-06 21:21:34,wallstreetbets,"Calls have exponential growth because of the iv. The problem being when you buy in when it's already high, you neuter your growth"
2021-04-06 21:46:56,wallstreetbets,"You could have bought those shares. Sold the same covered call and bought 116 more shares with the premium, or bought the same contract. Theta gang"
2021-04-06 23:18:20,wallstreetbets,"Looking at the price history for the 01/20/2023 360c, the only day it was trading for 215.45 was 01/29/2020 which must have been when he entered that position, when the underlying was around $360ish. So at that time 21k would have gotten him around 60 shares. That day was also very volatile though with GME ranging from 250-414 so I can't really tell the exact price at the moment his order filled. Buying 100 shares at that time would have cost between 25k-41k. Not to mention some brokers had a limit on how many shares/contracts you could buy, screenshot looks like he has TD and if I recall some days you could only buy up to 3 shares/contracts so it made more sense to just buy 3 contracts instead of 3 shares to simulate controlling more shares.

Options printing hard is based on the greeks, one of the big ones being delta. When he entered the contract the delta was probably around 78 but now it's dropped to 62."
2021-04-07 01:00:28,wallstreetbets,"Bro.... options print 10-50x what the stock does depending on A lot of factors in not going to go into... RKT for example stock went up 70% I believe? My contracts went up 1400%. 

ASO went up 13% or so contracts went up 400%"
2021-04-06 23:22:42,wallstreetbets,"Lol, no. Op's just kinda retarded though."

2021-04-06 22:48:23,wallstreetbets,"Sure, Newegg is doing this already for years. CompUSA was a big one in the 90s. We will need to see how GS differentiates. Selling gaming stuff is not special..any online stores can sell gaming stuff."
2021-04-07 18:09:10,wallstreetbets,YES!
2021-04-06 22:18:16,wallstreetbets,Objective opinion: I literally don’t know anything about options and even I felt on first glance you payed a slight premium 😬
2021-04-07 02:22:43,wallstreetbets,"Well, currently you have a contract to pay a premium for 100 GME shares(at today's prices). Should GME experience another spike, sell this contract before anything else. Yes IV should fly."
2021-04-07 11:56:02,wallstreetbets,"The IV isn't exactly what drives the exponential growth, although in this case they are jacked to the tits because of it."
2021-04-06 22:56:31,wallstreetbets,This. I've got 1 PMCC working well for me. Only had enough for 1.
2021-04-07 07:44:53,wallstreetbets,Wow. Everything spot on except my brokerage did not limit me at all in buying shares or options.

2021-04-07 08:08:42,wallstreetbets,What’s a stockmarket?
2021-04-06 23:17:24,wallstreetbets,"Ryan brought in a very good team of innovators, we'll see what happens next, I'm quite bullish on GS and the hedgies already lost cause the company is far from bankruptcy now"
2021-04-07 08:23:10,wallstreetbets,"Newegg is not gaming. Newegg is primarily pc components and they fucked up by selling out, which has led to terrible customer service and using a shit delivery service as their primary. Things GS can and most likely will learn from, given Cohens focus on service. Newegg has steadily gone down hill in the last ten years. If GS expands their inventory to pc components that rivals Newegg options, it’s actually an easy win."

2021-04-07 02:04:20,wallstreetbets,"I haven't seen a good business case for Gamestop in the future except in the vaguest sense. The only niche I see them actually filling is moving to solely selling gaming merchandise online. Any other potential move runs into too much competition. I think that's RC's plan as well, to just move the merchandise to online."

2021-04-07 12:50:09,wallstreetbets,"Steam won't be toppled, especially by the likes of gamestop. I think steam will only be budged off the top of PC gaming through some shift in paradigm like the rapid adoption of cloud gaming which people have been waiting around for years for (and Microsoft have been dipping their toe in the water in that regard). I don't know about gaming destinations mainly because that is essentially a cybercafe operation which is a hard market to do well in and doesn't really work in many countries (where most people have their own PCs and good internet). It has almost nothing to with their current business model except both involve games, too, so it's not like it's an obvious pivot.

I just think RC's takeover is less about a gaming revolution where he wants to compete with dominating companies and innovate the industry and more him seeing a niche for Gamestop to be completely online while capitalizing on their goodwill. Again looking at his past this is what he is good at, process and system improvement in competitive industries to turn around underperforming businesses."
2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"MYOV: Deep Value and Possible Buy Out Okay smooth brains, gonna come at you with some DD on a true value play (for those of you that can read). With a great entry as of writing.

The good stuff:

1 great drug, 3 potential use cases.
The basics of any biotech pharma company are the drugs and what they do. Simply put, relugolix (orgovyx) was approved by the FDA in December for the treatment of Prostate Cancer. The drug was so much better than its competition, they were granted priority review by the FDA. How much better were they? Well the competition was a once a month shot that had a high mortality rate due to cardiovascular issues. Since this approval, they have signed a 4.3b deal with pfizer for half the drug, and are now commercializing this together at a rapid pace.

The other use cases are endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Uterine fibroids have a pdufa (fda approval deadline) of June 1st and after meeting and exceeding all 3 phases of clinicals, are highly likely to pass (these are big positive catalysts).

This is also accompanied by 2 additional publications in the New England medical journal. One of the most renowned journals in the world.

Now that we’ve covered the basics in Lehman’s terms, let’s move on to the strategic outlay.


In january of 2021, Pfizer and Myovant announced a strategic partnership for men’s prostate cancer worth up to 4.3b for myovant. It also resulted in heavy upfront cash payments, and royalties in the double digits to myovant moving forward. After this announcement, the stock shot up to $31 a share.

Before this, another pharma giant, sumitomo, decided it was going to expand its pharmaceuticals pipeline. To do so it started an American subsidiary named sumitovant and purchased Roivants share of 5 different companies. To date, 4/5 of the companies are now private with urovant recently getting bought out by sumitovant at 100% premium. 

Myovant is the crown jewel of the vants. If you go to sumitovants website, they claim ownership over myovant already (53.5% makes them a majority holder).

It’s my theory that myovant is not far behind and will likely be purchased before June 1st PDUFA. At this time, the stock has been seeing a pretty large short interest increase and is trading below the PPS it had in November before approval for relugolix and before the Pfizer deal. 

Without a buyout, this is a steal of a value play.

Myovant has roughly 40% of their market cap in cash. Pfizer valued just the prostate cancer application at 8.4b. Their current market cap is ~1.8b and they are trading at $18.93 a share.

I plan to ride this rocket to Valhalla 🚀 🚀 🚀 

TLDR:
Company has successful drug applications that are new standards of care, a massive deal with Pfizer, wildly undervalued, and a potential buyout candidate. 

🚀 Positions: ~20k shares, 326 calls dated from 4/16 all the way to 1/22

Quick about me: I’ve been on WSB (mostly lurking) since mid 2020 and trading for years. My past plays include riding Tesla from $100 presplit, sunrun from $6, and of course GME from $10 all the way up to $400.

Prostate cancer is an epidemic in China and the CCP has made curing it a high priority. This made funds abundant and indiscriminate with hustlers drooling for a pay day.

At my last job I sat through 2 separate negotiations with Chinese companies looking to fund an American counterpart to do their prostate drug research. Desperate for cash we accepted. I got the fun job of protecting our IP from the spy they sent 2 months later. In the intro meeting he said ""I am here to take the IP back with me that wasn't covered in the contract""

""Strategic partnership"" just means Pfizer will run their trials on higher mammals, apes, and 1st stage human. That is what my company was going to do for a few of its drugs."

2021-04-07 10:14:32,wallstreetbets,"I think it’s an issue of an inefficient market and my personal bull fan theory would be management already having agreed on a buyout.
If they did agree on a buyout at a specific price when they signed the Pfizer deal, they wouldn’t want to ramp the stock price up. A buyout at 100% looks much better than 50%.

The only true negative catalyst has been switching the CEO in January. Who was a biotech veteran and known for commercialization expertise.

It doesn’t make sense. That’s why I think there is so much value here. They are trading under the price they were before FDA approval and a partnership with Pfizer. Even if there’s no buyout, the play is built on a solid fundamental value gap."
2021-04-07 10:14:56,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the good question!! Happy you read this and looked at the charts.
2021-04-07 16:42:58,wallstreetbets,It’s a STEAL right now.
2021-04-06 20:08:20,wallstreetbets,"This is what I expect in a WSB reply.

Fair enough on the claims, I can substantiate if this gains real traction and it makes those feel better about it. However, I always expect others to do their own due diligence. 

Deep value does have a different meaning here now, sadly.... I’m all about GME, but there is a huge reason for the name being deep value. It’s the type of stock play haha. 

For the bad stuff, you’re right, I should have included it, but I typed this on my phone and I’m fuckin lazy. 

Since you asked, I’d say that the CEO being replaced shortly after the Pfizer deal was concerning to me. Lynn was phenomenal and personally I think she was ousted because sumitomo was upset about the Pfizer deal, or because the deal involved pfizer getting half the rights and sumi getting to buy the company. This works because Pfizer had a right of first refusal to purchase as part of their seed funding agreement with myovant.
Ultimately my main concern is that 3 of the board members are sumitovant plants, and that they might try to buy the company for less than its worth.
Furthering concerns, the stock is heavily manipulated due to its low volume. It’s very easy to walk the price down using algos. 
It also has a high short interest, which will cause a squeeze in the case of a buyout and could possibly send the PPS over the buyout offer. 

At the end of the day, I appreciate the advice, but I’m probably not going to change. I’m lazy."

If you want me to bring more value to the ""community"", how about this... Here is actual DD about the actual drugs from someone who actually works in prostate cancer research. Shoutout to u/IamTtDJ

Here is a [direct link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stock_Market_DD/comments/mlxjrq/myov_deep_value_and_possible_buy_out/)  that is better formatted. Good luck with your play. I hope you put your entire savings into it based on the DD of u/awoketaco.  

BEGIN POST:

**I work in prostate cancer research. I think your assessment of the drug is pretty inaccurate.** Here's why:

Yes, in the trial testosterone levels were lower. But lower testosterone levels are not really a good outcome measure to show clinical benefit for a patient.. What we're really interested in here is progression to the hormone refractory (also known as castrate resistant) stage. The data I've seen do not suggest that it's much better at actually controlling advanced prostate cancer.
Cardiovascular incidents were lower, although even in the control arm they're still fairly infrequent (~3% vs ~6% in the control arm). Overall the two drugs are similar in terms of adverse events, treatment discontinuation was higher in the orgovyx.
your post makes it sound like there's only two options of drugs in this space. This drug belongs to a group known as hormone therapy or Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT), of which there are three main types:

LHRH agonists
Goserelin (Zoladex®)
Leuprorelin acetate (Prostap® or Lutrate®)
triptorelin (Decapeptyl® or Gonapeptyl Depot®)
Buserelin acetate (Suprefact®)
GnRH antagonists -
This includes this drug (orgovyx) and the control in the trial leuprolide. In the U.K at least I think the most commonly used is degarelix (Firmagon®)
Anti Androgens - These are almost always taken orally, like orgovyx
bicalutamide (commonly used in the U.K) (Casodex®)
cyproterone acetate (Cyprostat®)
flutamide (Drogenil®)
As you can see, there a lot of options for Hormone Therapy. All of these are competition for orgovyx, not just the drug in the comparator arm of the trial. I don't know what standard of care (SOC) hormone therapy is in the US, but I don't see how orgovyx will become SOC just because it perform better than 1 other GnRH antagonist in a trial. There are a lot of other treatments that may be more or less effective.

There is competition of other drugs to Hormone Therapy. I'm not sure about the US, but in the UK/EU as far as I'm aware SOC treatment for metastatic patients is moving away from traditional hormone therapies (listed above) and towards upfront docetaxel chemotherapy followed by treatment with Novel Hormonal Agents (NHAs -abiraterone, enzalutamide, likely apalutamide soon too). Use of ADT in metastatic patients is only likely to decrease as more effective treatments are brought through.

**This is not a game changing drug for prostate cancer at all. This is essentially just a variation of a well-established class of drug that doesn't appear to be any more effective in controlling metastatic prostate cancer - in a very crowded space.**

On the other hand, hormone therapies are commonly used drugs by a lot of patients and often for a long period of time. American healthcare is strange in terms of drug approval and choice by clinicians (NHA's are expensive), so despite everything above they may still sell lots of this drug. Personally, I don't see how it would be SOC. I wouldn't be keen to buy this stock based on its drug for prostate cancer and I'd like to know if you have counterarguments to the points above.

I have absolutely no idea how it will perform in other indications or what the treatment space looks like in those indications. I have nothing to add on the likelihood of any takeover etc."

This isn’t a cure for prostate cancer. It’s a treatment.

Sure our friend may work in cancer research, so do you think they understand how billing works? Switching to a gnrh treatment changes this to Rx billing. Not only that, it’s much more attractive to patients to take a pill then a shot. Especially one a lot less likely to kill them from a heart attack.

I’m not asking anyone to yolo their life savings. Just sharing knowledge. I would encourage everyone to do their own DD and make their own decision. 

All of that being said, there are other ways to express your opinion than the path you’ve chosen. The path you chose is aggressive and antagonistic to what the community stands for. We need to build each other up and not tear each other down."

1- leupron and zoladex are LHRH AGONISTS. since they induced “medical castration” by lowering the androgens levels, They have some unwanted side effects. they are injectable.  

2- relugolix is oral and a LHRH ANTAGONIST. very limited side effects and added benefit on cardiac side effects. The ONLY hormonal therapy given orally.   

3- the other anti-androgen treatments, which are oral medications are NOT given by themselves but rather administered IN COMBINATION with Hormonal therapy.   

4-chemotherapy is ONLY given when the tumor has metastasized. This is not a treatment that competes with the other treatments.

To build on this, one of the key strengths is that you get to be able to have children again if you should wish.

It is really important to remember, this isn't betting on gourds, or something crazy. This has life changing impacts for the end user. It is a socially benevolent application of science. 

Since you seem to be really interested in commenting and giving feedback, I have a couple of key takeaways for you after reading your replies:

1. If you don't want to invest, don't. No one is making you. Im not begging for investors, I am sharing knowledge. Yes, that has always been a part of this sub. 
2. Dont act like your hot shit. You're not more of an expert here after five minutes of reading someone elses comment. Humble yourself, read more than one opinion, and go do some research, as I previously encouraged.
3. Learn how to give productive feedback and not be an asshole, and maybe people will stop calling you an asshole and downvoting your shit lol."
2021-04-07 06:08:17,wallstreetbets,"Sorry when I say pharma I mean the 10 companies. 

I am leveraged to the tits on mrk. This isn’t r/investing 60leaps $85 strikes . Their covid antiviral trials should be concluded may 28. We will see if that leads to an FDA emergency approval .

This is wsb where u chase that 500%"
2021-04-07 13:34:42,wallstreetbets,There is a reason why they keep releasing this data as the FDA is probably pushing back pretty hard.
2021-04-07 13:10:57,wallstreetbets,"Cool. Thanks for the additional info. 

As for your feedback, I humbly submit my feedback to your feedback:

1. Cool.

2. The first ""your"" should actually be the contraction ""you're"" as in ""you are hot shit"". You nailed it in the second sentence. Good job!

3. lol. downvotes don't hurt feelings. neither does internet strangers calling names. Neither should people giving actual constructive criticism or challenging DD."
2021-04-07 13:41:24,wallstreetbets,"I mean the clinical trials have been scheduled for years. The data is being released as part of the trial. 

However, they also seem to be doing a PR dump lately, which could be a sign of a buyout. Any substantial information that sumi knows that the market doesn’t could be used to say that they acted on insider information in the course of a buyout. 

Either way, I’m still very bullish on this approval. The backing from Pfizer on the trials and publications also helps. This is a company quickly moving on large partnerships and commercialization."
2021-04-07 13:42:38,wallstreetbets,I am sure they will get approval. I am just doubtful on profitability.

2021-04-07 02:24:09,wallstreetbets,Is it just me or does ASO look like it's primed for a bit of a squeeze?
2021-04-07 18:55:26,wallstreetbets,I don't understand why people are freaking out about the AH dip. not even 4 days ago it was where it is now. zoom out of the charts

2021-04-07 16:43:34,wallstreetbets,Oof -- down 5.5% after hours.
2021-04-07 17:34:33,wallstreetbets,"JPM unloaded a 9MM block after-hours, feels like last week when they front-ran the Hwang fiasco. Related or did the next highly leveraged family-office blow up?"
2021-04-07 18:53:15,wallstreetbets,"The SEC does not exist when it's buddies manipulate a stock to no end.  This company had stelllar earnings. The GOONS sold calls on the news. Now, they aggressively tank the stock so those calls don't print! I'm not in the play as I got stopped out 10minutes after I got in and smelt something.  Someone needs to stand up to this kind of thing. LOOK AT ASO AH!"
2021-04-07 09:27:23,wallstreetbets,I have some money that needs to find an investment home. Anyone want to give me the rundown on ASO and why it’s a good investment?
2021-04-07 16:44:11,wallstreetbets,Ouch on the after market today
2021-04-06 21:10:31,wallstreetbets,High 30s to low 40s by Friday!

2021-04-07 05:54:31,wallstreetbets,"I’ve thought a lot about this play and feel even better. I’ve got four kids that are all able to play sports again with reopening. Made me realize this is probably the last unexploited high SI reopening play. On top of that, ASO sells guns and ammo. The political environment is only increasing demand in that market. TLDR, sports, guns, short squeeze, ‘merica!"
2021-04-07 05:45:41,wallstreetbets,You convince me. Im in for 15 shares.

2021-04-06 20:27:53,wallstreetbets,What’s the exit strategy?
2021-04-06 21:42:07,wallstreetbets,BRAVE. I'd be poopin myself. Straight trippin' checking for any signs of movement.
2021-04-06 23:17:43,wallstreetbets,"I think ASO is a great company. Actually more promising than GME as a long-term hold. Just don't expect it to go absolutely crazy like GME, it can and should go up, but it won't do a 1000% increase as GME has done. It's more like a RKT situation than a GME one IMO."
2021-04-07 19:15:37,wallstreetbets,Senile Joe is about to unconstitutionally take matters into his own hands with some executive order crap. This is a good play. Academy has great gun pricing and they sell ammo faster than they can get it on the shelves and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future
2021-04-07 00:52:14,wallstreetbets,Not a yolo if it’s a smart move which is gonna  guarantee more bananas to help win the war in $gme
2021-04-07 00:12:28,wallstreetbets,Here is something for next time.  When a big event occurs many buy short dated calls. Those that sell the calls do all they can to suppress the price :(  They will do everything to push this under $27.50 I believe.  The pain price is $25 and I can't imagine that being accomplished. I bought despite this but got stopped out and will look to re.enter on Friday. See someone suggested selling calls. I think if you sell some calls above what you paid it would be good protection. The only risk is that you lose your shares at a higher price than what you paid plus you get the premium. Based on the options curve it is very likely it finishes the week around $30 at best.

2021-04-07 14:33:57,wallstreetbets,100 shares @ 25ish. Sold the 4/16 35c for about $200 and sold the 5/21 25p for about $200. Quick way to milk out some extra dough while IV is high. If I get assigned I don't care I just made >40% or own 200 shares at 25 (I like the stock).

2021-04-07 18:50:32,wallstreetbets,Completely agreed. This is a growth stock and I’m holding. Granted I only have 217 shares not $125000 worth but still
2021-04-07 17:50:54,wallstreetbets,"Options will probably be big red tomorrow.  Otherwise if you own the stock, I wouldn’t sweat it. I believe the stock is undervalued.  I like the store. People like the store. I like the stock."
2021-04-06 20:38:47,wallstreetbets,It hold 30 and 31 very well so I'm expecting that.
2021-04-06 22:20:07,wallstreetbets,"I've been seeing this said, but I really can't see any reason why it would rise that much in such a short span. I mean today it had almost double average volume and it fizzled out after it hit 34. 

Trust me, I hope it does cause my calls will fucking print. But I just think it hitting 40 will be over the next few weeks"

also selling puts in my ira"
2021-04-06 21:26:44,wallstreetbets,If you want to sell at 40 then sell the 40 call. Then if it ends itm you keep all the even higher premium and exit where you wanted
2021-04-06 22:22:45,wallstreetbets,"You’re not trapped. Your stock has a delta of 1 and your short call has a delta of less than 1. If the stock goes higher you will make more money on your long stock than you will lose on your short call so you can just close out the trade. 

If you sell a CC on a lowish vol stock and the stock spikes AND vol spikes the above remains true but buying back your call will just be kind of painful (you’ll still make money). 

For ASO iv is like 130% already so I don’t think that will be a huge issue."
2021-04-07 19:57:02,wallstreetbets,I bought in at $31 (rookie mistake) is it worth holding or best to cut my losses when the bell rings?
2021-04-07 19:32:32,wallstreetbets,"I’ve got a 10@ $25 so I’m not sweating it. I was thinking about a December option today for a longer play, but thought I’d better wait a bit. Glad I did so if I’m still feeling it I can get in lower."
2021-04-07 18:03:41,wallstreetbets,undervalued was at $22... not after a 40% climb to 30... lol
2021-04-06 22:52:24,wallstreetbets,There’s a decent gamma ramp and higher short interest so it will either be a slow chug against the shorts or a pop through that $40 number.
2021-04-07 19:51:18,wallstreetbets,AH looking good for them.
2021-04-07 11:46:32,wallstreetbets,Weird cause looking at its history there were times it went down.

2021-04-06 21:38:52,wallstreetbets,How would you keep extra premium if it goes ITM?  When you sell a covered call isn't the premium you get from selling it that day all you get?  Or did you mean to say you get the difference between $31 and $40 strike price sale?

2021-04-07 15:02:02,wallstreetbets,Rising from $31 to $40 in three days would increase their market cap by about $1b. Note that it's already increased by about $0.75b in the last week. No way retail could do anything to influence that number. Seems super unlikely to see another 30% change in three days.

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Right Wing Billionaire, Charles Koch, Is Backing INTERSTATE COMMERCE FOR CANNABIS. TilAphria 🚀🚀🚀 Trulieve 💩💩💩 [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.politico.com/amp/news/2021/04/06/charles-koch-snoop-dogg-marijuana-legalization-479148](here is the article)

Snoop Dogg and Charles Koch's group ""Americans for Prosperity(AFP)"" are working together to form the Cannabis Freedom Alliance (CFA). I know everyone is **shocked** by Snoop Dogg's support, but let's focus on the highly influential right wing group: AFP. 

>""Americans for Prosperity, founded by the Koch brothers in 2004, is one of the most influential organizations in conservative politics. The group rivals and even eclipses the official GOP in terms of its size, scope and spending.""

Directly from the article. So now cannabis is getting support from conservatives, in a big way, and conservatives **love** free and open markets. They will tell you where you can put your regulations, just ask em. So, on top of a **much better** chance of getting 10-12 Republicans to vote in favor of Cannabis, which is great news for everyone, this is also **AMAZING** news for Candian LP's like TilAphria, and bad news for MSOs like TruShit. I mean Trulieve. 

Don't believe me? According to one of the founders of the CFA (from the article): 

>""A lot of big cannabis companies are fighting against things like interstate commerce because it doesn’t support their business model,” Angelos said. “That’s another reason why [AFP] is a perfect ally on this because they support free and open markets.”

*Weeeeeeeeird*. Do you guys think it's ""big cannabis companies"" like TilAphria or other large LPs fighting the interstate commerce, or *maybe* ones like Trulieve who are desperately clinging on to their dying business models? If interstate commerce is allowed, it will cost LPs only **shipping costs** to send their products to all 50 states, and their juicy markets. They already sit on an excess of product and grow space, just waiting for bigger markets. 

Meanwhile, Trulieve spent 60m+ on 2 retail stores, then diluted. 🤦. So whatever markets they just spent 60m on, will eventually be available to everyone else (LPs and MSOs) for the **cost of shipping** to their stores or other new stores in the same area, post legalization with interstate commerce. No real long term cannabis company is focused on building a retail focused business. Just ask Curaleaf (read their ER) why their EU expansion is so exciting. They have **no** intentions of vertically integrating AND INSTEAD are building large manufacturing and distributing centers to serve large regions. Ya know, like Coke or Marlboro or Corona or literally any other CPG giant. Y'all been in a Coke owned store lately? Hm. How about the Corona ones? Hm.... Well, surely the Marlboro store? Those are everywhere!......

The kind of the interesting thing about the switch from a medical market to a recreational market is that 100% of the time, some of the the biggest opponents of the switch from medical to recreational are the current medical companies. Why would they want a bunch of new competition, regulations, and taxes? They don't. They fight the bills in the name of ""patients rights"" or some other made up bullshit. 

Then there's the other side of the coin. Once the switch from medical to recreational finally does happen, medical companies tend to find a lot less recreational companies wanting to work with them than they'd like. When you have to sit on the sidelines while someone else builds a monopoly, you aren't too keen to help them. 

Recreational business owners aren't stupid either. They are fully aware of those helping reinforce the ""status quo."" So, imagine you were to open a recreational marijuana dispensary after waiting for **years** in Florida, and a Trulieve sales rep walks in with their shitty logo on his shirt, how likely would *you* be to put their products on your shelf? I mean, why would you when there would be countless other brands to choose from with no retail presence? You wouldn't. It would make no sense. People who want Trulieve product can just go to a Trulieve store. Plus, wouldn't you purposefully **not**carry the same thing as your direct competitor, and especially their own in house brands? Unless you're ""Cookies,"" I just don't see that happening, and Trulieve AINT ""Cookies."" 

From a customer or ""patient"" perspective, in Florida, are you going to a Trulieve store for the 1,536th time after legalization, or ""Starbuds"" that just opened down the road with ""100+ new brands!"" sign out front?  Best case scenario would be Trulieve also adds a huge new line of other companies brands to their shelves, but is that really *good* news for them? They'd lose say 30-60% of their shelf space across all 70+ stores. That's gonna cause a surplus of weed for them pretty quickly.

They currently make so much money because they essentially own a monopoly on stores, and a monopoly on products within those stores. You want weed and live in FL? There's a 50% chance you're going to a Trulieve store, and a 100% chance you'll get a Trulieve product in that store. I've never seen something more ""priced in"" in my entire life, yet people still think Trulieve is going higher. Trulieve is only $40+ because of the *current* market regulations. Take away the favorable regulations, and you take away Trulieve, and get TruShit. 

Post legalization, each Trulieve store will just be one of **X** amount in a town selling weed. Florida currently has a dispensary ratio of around 1.1. Fully legal states have ratios closer to 10. Thats 10x the competition, just to get customers in the door. Even **if** they do come in Trulieve's door, they may not even buy a Trulieve product since they would be forced to carry other brands as well as their own.

Not every MSO is fighting for a fully legal market, and it's pretty obvious to point out the ones who could potentially be **hurt** the most by a free and open market. TruShit being king among them. In my retarded opinion, wholesale focused MSOs and LPs are much much much better long term options for a legal market. Stop investing in a dying medical market, 🤷. 

TilAphria 🚀🚀🚀🚀

With most offices shut down due to covid, and there being a vast shortage of office paper needing to be recycled, the Koch bros. Are having to use brand new paper to make into toilet paper which completely destroys the margin on toilet paper.

What's tiresome is trying so hard to paint one person as a bad guy, that they will try to paint another bad guy as a good guy because he's supposed to be 'not them'.

Snoop Dogg is a piece of shit, garbage human being.  It's absurd to try and characterize him as a 'good guy' because it's easy to paint him as the opposite of someone else.

And, his music after Doggystyle sucks anyways."

2021-04-07 10:42:50,wallstreetbets,The point I'm trying to make is that Altria/Constellation/etc. have the financial resources to invest money into the US as well as Canada (whether cross border cannabis transportation is allowed or not).  They are not going to be satisfied with throwing molotov cocktails into the US from Canada with distribution only and Altria (and others) will most likely try and buy MSOs.  Point being in a post of TilAphria to the moon you are bringing up Cronos as your defense which shows that it is by far not 'in the bag' they will dominate.  I'm not saying they won't I'm saying there are risks that need to be considered

When you buy a company, you're obligated to pay them a multiple of what they would have expected to do in sales. As these shops were direct competitors to Trulieve, and therefore Trulieve stood to gain revenue by acquiring them.

2021-04-07 10:53:39,wallstreetbets,"Sure. It isn't hard to imagine how LPs will make purchases in the US. Just look at Curaleaf's approach to the EU as a blueprint of what's coming for LPs entry into the US. 

First off, it would make no sense for most LPs to purchase a ""large"" MSO. Most ""large"" MSOs have built their books by operating vertically integrated markets, and have heavy retail burdens. Retail stores will have little to no value in a legal market. There will be tens of thousands of stores nationwide, so spending 60m+ (Trulieve) on 2 locations is retarded. Like 400%+ breakeven FD's with 0 DTE retarded. 

For comparison, 4Front spent 60m to being construction on their **OVER 500K SQFT** growing facility in Illinois. Their 60m investment will allow them to supply *nations* with Cannabis, in an open legal market. What is Trulieve's 60m purchase of 2 dispensaries going to look like in 2024-2025? It's gonna look like wasted money, that's what. 

Also, I bring up Cronos because they are most likely to make a large MSO purchase. Out of the ""large"" LPs, Cronos is the weakest. Cronos has also said they are focused on brand building. So If *any* LPs were to purchase a large MSO it would be them. It also helps they are sitting on about 1.2B of Altria's money for M&A. 

However like I said before, it just doesn't make sense for LPs to purchase large footprint MSOs. They are already sitting on an excess of cannabis and grow space, they just need the markets MSOs operate in. Not the MSOs themselves"

2021-04-07 11:13:55,wallstreetbets,"The only thing a retail heavy MSO would bring to the table is distribution. 

Trulieve would be the biggest distribution play, based on store count. However, 99% of their stores are in Florida. But even at 80+ stores, Trulieve is a tiny little roach compared to distribution agreements Altria and Constellation already have. Imagine Altria's distribution to a corner store like 7 Eleven (who sells alcohol, cigarettes, and even CBD). not even mentioning the countless other gas station and corner store brands. **Just** 7/11. That **one** agreement alone **DWARFS** Trulieve's network. 

Constellation has the same agreements, plus bars and other venues that are alcohol only. They won't need to reinvent the entire agreement to supply THC products. They simply need interstate commerce to be allowed. That's it. Once a company like Cronos (Altria) or Canopy (Constellation) gets the greenlight to start shipping, their products will be in every legal state within the week. 

7 Eleven does not have endless shelf space, and their tobacco shelf space is already **highly** dominated by Altria. MSOs **do not** have these kinds of agreements, and they are going to have a hard time finding shelf space in places where Altria already dominates the shelf. How often do you see new tobacco companies added to corner store shelves? Never. It's like cosmetics in a grocery store, meaning you can take their shelf space over their dead bodies. 

If you're actually looking at investing in an open and legal market (whenever that is. 2022-2030), then you'll see LPs are actually in a much much much much better place to capitalize on US markets with very little capital needed to do so. Unlike MSOs who have been paying 60m to open 2 stores in a new state. *Cough Trulieve Cough*"

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$SPY - The Coked Out Bull Who Outran Inflation - S&P 500 Trade Thesis What’s poppin’ fellas, I’ve got a trade thesis for y’all which I need picked apart. Although I spent a great deal of time discussing it with the greatest minds Twitter and Discord had to offer, I still can’t shake the feeling that this trade is pretty fuckin’ stupid at face value, so bare with me.

&nbsp;

I was a little drunk on Easter, and had an epiphany :

- SPY 100 - 200 took roughly 14 years.
- SPY 200 - 300 took 3.5 years.
- SPY 300 - 400 took a little over a year.

&nbsp;

With the rate things are going, SPY 400 - 500 is looking like it’s set to happen in under a year, maybe even faster. Hell, in our current investing environment, I would be shocked to see SPY lower than 500 by the end of the year. Asset inflation is running rampant which is indirectly driving up the value of equities, we’re printing fuckloads of money with no end in sight, and money is flowing into the markets out the ass as investing becomes increasingly mainstream. I know a lot of people will doubt me for these things, but I’m thoroughly convinced that this is what modern day inflation looks like.

&nbsp;

/u/DustyBowls had an awesome writeup on this which can be found below :

---

&nbsp;

**The stock market is not a bubble. This is inflation. This is what modern inflation looks like. The federal government - Dem or Repub matters little, as Bush, Obama, Trump and now Biden all did this - they hide the true inflation by excluding things from the inflation basket such as real estate. All the easy money, low interest rates and supermassive spending by Bernanke, Yellen, now JPow.**

&nbsp;

**This is why the upper middle class and to a much greater extent the rich can profit at all times - they're so heavily into stocks and other financial devices plus housing and land that the massive devaluation of the dollar and the explosion in inflation is not their problem - they just rise with the tide. Regular middle class and worker bees (the 99.6%) are seeing massive pay cuts in the form of inflation. You got a decent job making high five / low six figures and want to buy a place? Even in mid-size midwestern towns, the housing market is so hot that you just got priced out of the market. And you'll never get back into because this is not a bubble that will burst - this is inflation. The Federal government is going to print even more money and devalue the dollar so that its debt / GDP doesn't get too fuked. The rich don't care. The well-positioned middle class (a minority of the middle class) don't care. Everyone else should. You got a $600 or $1400 or $2500 stimulus check? Cool story the housing price and your rent just went up 10% compound for the next five years and you're far worse off than you were.**

&nbsp;

**It ain't a bubble it's a rising sea. If you aren't in a yacht or at least a skipper, you're fukin’ drowning man. Your flat salary, your savings account, your hourly wage - you just got a LOT poorer.**

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

By riding the coattails of the rich, we can look to become a lot less poor in the process. We’ve identified the trend, and now *we* can also rise with the tide. Ultimately, our end goal seems to be SPY 500. The price action over the past year reinforces this, as we’ve gone from $264 to $405 (over a 55% increase) during that time period. Hell, even the past decade of data supports us. **Every year from 2008 onwards, bar 2015 and 2018 have easily netted a 20% return.** If we see an increase that’s even remotely as good, we will be well ITM by the time our year is up. SPY 01/21/2022 500Cs are trading for $1.00. Dirt fuckin cheap. For more risk averse traders, we can go with a SPY 450C 01/21/2022 for $5.00 instead. Regardless of the chosen strikes, if these plays hit, it’s at minimum a 10 bagger, likely more.

&nbsp;

Personally, I’m going to look for an entry around SPY 400 since we’ve left some gnarly gaps, but I’m thoroughly convinced that we may continue to rip. We need less than a 20% increase in 10 months, which is well within reach. We’re in a fucked up investing landscape, which is heavily skewed towards exponential growth. All we need to do is take the leap of faith, and reap the reward in a couple of months. 

&nbsp;

All that being said, **I can’t think of a good bear thesis, so this is where I turn to y’all**. I’m not worried about the “bubble” popping, as I don’t think we’re in a bubble; This entire system is just a byproduct of the insane amounts of money we have printed. In my eyes, the only thing that can stop SPY 500 from happening is us getting nuked by North Korea, a new strain of super aids wiping out a good chunk of civilization, or aliens coming down and fucking some shit up. If any of those things happen however, we’ve got bigger problems than our SPY 500Cs expiring OTM. If anyone has a decent bear thesis, please lay it on me. 

&nbsp;

**__TLDR__**: Fuckloads of printed money combined with asset inflation will be a pretty nuts combo for the markets. Bears r fuk. Buy **SPY 01/21/2022 500C**."
2021-04-06 22:30:02,wallstreetbets,"So is the argument against this thesis that SPY just won’t hit $500, or is it about timing? I’ve read numerous pieces outlining how the market will produce negative overall returns for the next decade, which seems too bearish. I also see merit in OPs logic. But perhaps the outcome is somewhere in between. Maybe it just takes a little longer to reach 500. In that case, the June 2022 $500c is ~$3.25, the Dec 2022 is ~$6.25, and the Dec 2023 is ~$13.50. With VIX and IV so low right now, buying options is cheaper than usual. Anyone who sees merit in OPs thesis should at least consider buying options. I’m leaning towards the Dec 2022 calls myself. Feels like enough cushion for risking $625."
2021-04-06 23:47:56,wallstreetbets,"This is actually intelligent and i agree with your conclusions. I too see no bear side. The best i can think is that the gains you'll get are not as big as they seem because the money is devalued. But this is only an issue if you are holding shares and riding that 20% ""growth"" (i.e. inflation). If you indeed go 10x with the calls then who cares about 20% inflation."

2021-04-06 20:48:09,wallstreetbets,"2 cents from a smooth brain, but the yearly percentages are totally skued this year. I mean, you put a dollar in anywhere last March/April and there’s no way you’re not up 55% at least. JPOW is making weekly ‘all good’ statements now, which should concern all, quiet is all good not weekly strokefests. A great job report was released on a closed Friday, so everything popped on Monday, but was down today. SLR ended and we just passed banks’ lockup expiration on 3/31. They’ve been saying ‘all good’ but I’m sure there are a ton of people that, like me, were getting hammered by banks over the last 4 months to change my fixed mortgage APR to a variable (so they can buy a 2nd lambo when it goes past 7%). If tomorrow is a down day we’re gonna grind way down by EOM because Thursday for sure will be a down day cause JPOW’s gonna say ‘all good’ again. I didn’t even mention China and US possible Olympics boycott.. 
Not financial advice.

TLDR: We don’t hit a new SPY 52 high tomorrow we are f’ed for the quarter at least."

* SPY 300 - 400 took a little over a year. (this is +25%) 1\*4= 4 years (double)

2021-04-07 16:00:29,wallstreetbets,"You get less leverage buying shares. Buying a call that's deep enough ITM will get you something that more or less mirrors the price changes in the underlying. If the underlying goes up a dollar, the price of the call will go up a dollar. So you can either buy 100 shares of SPY for $40,600 or you can buy a $200 strike call that expires in 2024 for $20,100. You can essentially ""buy"" twice as many shares on the extreme end of safety with call options. You risk SPY collapsing, and as it gets closer and closer to your call strike price and expiration date its value decreases until it drops below $200. Then your $20,000 call expires worthless whereas your 100 shares of SPY have only lost half their value.

As your risk tolerance increases so does the leverage. Instead of buying a call that expires 2.5 years from now you can buy one that expires in 6 months. And instead of an extremely safe $200 call you can pick a more risky but still quite safe $350 call. This costs a bit over $6000. Now if SPY goes up 10% in the next 6 months you make over 50%.

The lower the strike, the lower you break even, the lower the leverage and vice versa.
You could buy a call that is OTM and a week til expiration for 5 bucks, and on the off chance SPY goes up $20 in a week you turn that into $500."

It'll be bond's that bring it down.

2021-04-07 00:08:22,wallstreetbets,"A bear thesis to consider. 

I would say the popping will happen if wages can't keep up with inflation and we get Stagflation. Congress is pushing for a $15 minimum wage which will allow for inflation to rise more. If not, it will limit the cost increase a company can pass on to its consumers and hurt its profitability. Enough companies with bad profits will bring the SPY down.
Other things pressuring companies in the SPY.

Building material costs are going up affecting construction, significantly rising prices. Semiconductor shortages are affecting automakers right now, but will spread to other industries. Shipping container prices have gone up so much that it is affecting US exports. Because it is more cost effective to send them back empty than wait for them to be loaded with US goods(mostly ag. products).

The delinquency rate for FHA homes is over 17.5%, these are in forbearance. Once the forbearance ends they will default and the lenders will dump them on the market.

Lastly, the government borrowed $3 trillion last spring, but didn't spend it all right away. This gave them a buffer to be able to spend without having to take out more debt and taking some pressure off Treasury Yields. That money will run out around June, forcing the government to borrow more which will need to be monetized by the Fed. What will the Fed do to ensure a market for the Treasuries? That will determine whether your call prints or not."

2021-04-07 00:18:09,wallstreetbets,"I’m not necessarily a bull but just want to point out that rate increases should not be considered part of any decent bear thesis.

Compare forbearance now to forbearance circa 2007-2008 and its not that bad. I’ve dug into this data quite a bit in the last year or so and can link you to much of it if you want when I’m at my desktop tomorrow. The quality of borrower is very substantially higher. The housing market is absolute insanity right now but banks and credit unions have not repeated the same mistakes they did in the years preceding the GFC by lending money to literally anyone. 

Supply shortages I generally agree with the reasoning on. The Fed is absolutely manipulating the reported inflation rate and prices across the country in most industries are substantially higher. Anyone working supply side for any trade has seen this since the start of the year. 

The best bear thesis I’ve seen, and probably the one I agree with is that Archegos is not a unique situation and we’re likely to see another Archegos-esque failure which will cascade into a feedback loop of overleveraged fund liquidating all positions which sends the market deep red and causes this process all the way down other funds. We are in a liquidity crisis and the recent bull run with the push through 4000 on SPX was done on horribly low volume. I think we see another flash crash in a March 2020 esque sale and then a long term bear market as funds de lever."

Which means you have to fucking keep on fucking time or else the entire point of your instrument is fucking useless.

It's not like a woodwind, where there are four of them playing. If you're playing the triangle in a composure, youre it.

You're *the guy*. 

That shits wired up to an amp and if you miss your timing by one beat, it will not work and you will fuck up the performance with the stupidest instrument of all time.

2021-04-06 20:17:33,wallstreetbets,"I think it's bittersweet and dipped in dramatic irony. To think it's a purely happy ending is to endorse the psychopathic, abusive, brutal pursuit of greatness which I strongly don't believe the film is endorsing. 

Redemption, yes, but also very tragic in the classical greek sense.

(What an amazing movie)"
2021-04-06 20:19:01,wallstreetbets,"When I saw it with friends, I commented on the fact that this is a tragic ending was not present enough in the way it was shot, and was dismissed.

The *entire* point of the movie is that he was pushing himself too hard, and needed to get out. His father is looking on in horror as he destroys himself for that solo. His drum set is *covered* in blood.

https://www.slashfilm.com/whiplash-ending/ the writer/director agrees. ""And at 30, he dies of a drug overdose."""
2021-04-07 01:16:48,wallstreetbets,"It’s not a redemption. That smile and understanding look they share at the end alludes to the fact that the drummer has fallen back into the unhealthy obsession and willingness to do *anything* in order to be one level closer to *absolute perfection* that was brought about by JK Simmons’ character.

JK Simmons’ character, throughout the film, is clearly a huge narcissistic piece of shit. The man thinks he’s a musical god. He manipulates the drummer, plays mind games with him, makes him believe that he’s worthless (when he’s actually an amazing drummer), just to push him even further into breaking his own soul in an attempt to achieve “legendary” musician status.

Near the end of the movie, the drummer finally gets away from it and tries to live a semi-normal life.

But then, at the end of the movie, this look that they share lets the audience know that the drummer has tragically fallen right back into JK Simmons’ trap.

It’s heartbreaking, actually. The kid is a brilliant musician but JK Simmons’ character has convinced him that the only person in the world qualified to say that he is a brilliant musician is JK Simmons’ character. So in the end, the look they share shows that the drummer still needs the approval of JK Simmons’ character, instead of realizing on his own that he is a fantastic musician."
2021-04-06 22:59:58,wallstreetbets,"I thought it was a pretty dark ending after what he had gone through to get that approval.
Like he gets what he wanted but was it worth it all? Great movie but I do think it’s tragic"
2021-04-07 08:33:03,wallstreetbets,Fletcher mouths two words in that last shot. You can’t see it. I think it’s “good job.” Earlier in the film he says “good job” is the absolute worst thing to tell someone.

and even apologised to strangers when they knock his head with popcorn. 
And limphandheld him around life, preferring it when he was a dead end barrista. Terrible parenting."

2021-04-07 00:55:57,wallstreetbets,"It is to some extent because it’s “cool”, but not as much as people strive to be able to play very quickly but also evenly. There’s no good in playing really quickly when you aren’t playing with even rhythm because it wouldn’t sound good. If you’re able to play this quickly though, then you have such good dexterity that you can probably play most anything with great rhythm and consistent tempo"

2021-04-06 22:18:30,wallstreetbets,"To me always saw it as the birth of “one of the greats” wherein Miles Teller’s character achieves the greatness he had sought after, labored for, and been abused for. It’s a happy ending in the sense that he scored a victory and came out of the other side of being put through the ringer by Simmons’ character. Although I see your point, the question of whether or not it was worth the abuse to get there is one of the main things the film is exploring"
2021-04-06 22:31:53,wallstreetbets,Exactly.  The price of greatness comes at the cost of everything else.

2021-04-06 23:16:19,wallstreetbets,I think that's the point of the scene.  To exaggerate what he is doing to himself so the audience knows he is beating himself physically to the point where his hands are going to be torn up.

JK Simmons asked him to come in to play Caravan and then switched the song on him without telling him, to ""show him who's boss"" once more.  But he came back out, took control, showed himself, his parents, and the audience that he had mastered it...finally.  Only to receive the hard-fought approval of Simmons, after all of that abuse.  There isn't a happy ending, it's bittersweet in that behind every great performance is someone who has abused themselves to get to that point.
There's even blood on the cymbal.
He reached his peak greatness.

2021-04-06 23:22:27,wallstreetbets,Watch it its not as bad as some say. It's mostly just shows the negative sides of some leaders in the field.
2021-04-06 23:29:21,wallstreetbets,"Musician here and I’ve met the person that played the director in whiplash at a gig (don’t remember his name and too lazy to look it up) also seen the movie. It’s pretty good just don’t treat it as super realistic. Yeah, there are stories and shit of people acting that way in the old days of jazz but not really anymore. Soundtrack is definitely good though and he actually took time to practice his 7/8 countoff. He said he was nervous as shit counting them off because they’re all legit cats lol"
2021-04-06 22:27:13,wallstreetbets,And one of them is so damned envious of the other which fuels the hate
2021-04-06 23:46:37,wallstreetbets,It's Drumline with white people and jazz. Both movies sucked bad.
2021-04-06 22:28:24,wallstreetbets,"Yes, this is how I saw it too."
2021-04-06 22:45:03,wallstreetbets,"You do make a good point. It was thrilling to watch him in his ""one of the greats"" moment for sure."
2021-04-06 22:37:01,wallstreetbets,I saw it as leading to a 2nd suicidal student.
2021-04-06 22:11:43,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that even though he’s continuing to chase this craft, it’s not healthy. We see the siren song through his eyes and understand why he acts the way he does, but it’s not sustainable or “good.”"
2021-04-07 00:06:46,wallstreetbets,I wish someone in the league 😂
2021-04-06 22:38:09,wallstreetbets,Fuuuuuck so much yes. I can't wait until the plot picks up more just for his voice acting.
2021-04-06 23:59:38,wallstreetbets,"I understand. I’m asking something different: if you have 1000 shares while I only have one, do we get an equal number of votes? 

Also, how many shares does it take to pressure a recall? 

Also, isn’t the recall just automatically announced about 60 days before the shareholder meeting?"
2021-04-06 23:23:31,wallstreetbets,Correct! Whiplash is not a movie about music or drums. Whiplash is a movie about abuse.
2021-04-06 23:58:50,wallstreetbets,"It says it in the comment, you'll fuck your posts up and develop bad form. Think of it like sports. Would you ask someone who's never run before to go run a marathon, and expect them to manage that without a long painful recovery, and possibly injuries that may last for a long time. Lots of possibilities for joint, muscle, ligament, and tendon damage. I've heard of drummers getting stress fractures in their feet from using the kick drum, for example."
2021-04-07 01:04:22,wallstreetbets,Thats alot of people to shower
2021-04-07 02:44:34,wallstreetbets,"Wait, did he die of a drug overdose? I don't remember that part"
2021-04-07 05:45:08,wallstreetbets,Cymbal
2021-04-07 00:02:28,wallstreetbets,Correct
2021-04-07 01:34:21,wallstreetbets,J. K. Simmons is his name. AKA J. Jonah Jameson.
2021-04-06 22:42:42,wallstreetbets,"It's Flecher that's envious of Neiman, btw, despite it seeming the other way around."
2021-04-06 23:48:01,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like you didn’t actually watch the movie, tbh. You couldn’t be more objectively wrong in your comparison. Literally the only thing tying them together is a drum, and only a single one at that."
2021-04-07 14:03:27,wallstreetbets,"Right, it was as if he finally overcame fletcher and in front of a real audience as well"
2021-04-07 01:10:00,wallstreetbets,"I don't know, but as I said before I would hope they already have a system in place with that figured out.   

The recall is not something shareholders control, it would be the company, what I was suggesting is that the shareholders request a vote on something to force a recall to be done.  


If it is then we are certainly close to it happening as someone else pointed out that they usually do it mid-June and it is nearing mid-April so get a helmet, we are going to the moon."
2021-04-07 01:02:19,wallstreetbets,"So you wanna completely deny those brilliant, brilliant arrangements in Ellington's opus? Buddy Rich? No? Music is emotion, man.."
2021-04-07 06:33:17,wallstreetbets,I've seen exactly the same form of abuse from a swimming teacher in the national team. Watching that movie was cathartic.
2021-04-07 00:29:30,wallstreetbets,"Thank you! I guess since I'm self-taught, I wouldn't recognize that I was entering a ""damaging tempo"". I was trying to figure out what is different about an extra x BPM physiologically. 

Wooow. I have a newfound respect for drummers now, calluses are about the most battle damage I've heard of from a guitar."
2021-04-07 04:01:11,wallstreetbets,Gotta get the blood off the symbol somehow.
2021-04-07 08:30:48,wallstreetbets,That’s in Whiplash 2: Tokyo Whip.
2021-04-07 14:22:03,wallstreetbets,"In an interview with the Director he said that was destined to be his future.  Once that high from drumming or JK was gone, he was destined to become a burnout and die of a drug overdose"
2021-04-07 13:40:43,wallstreetbets,"Voice to text.  Damn it.  I was a drummer all through my youth and into high school too.  Vic Firth, Yamaha sfz's, and zildjian all the way!"
2021-04-07 02:17:06,wallstreetbets,"Yes, thank you! I had a summer gig playing for a theater in Bigfork, Montana. He apparently had this gig in his 20s and really liked it so he visits there most summers just to say hi."
2021-04-06 23:11:44,wallstreetbets,I can't imagine anyone that watched the movie would actually think otherwise.  It's a fairly big plot point.
2021-04-06 23:49:59,wallstreetbets,Wrong. Watched both. Both were about as shitty as joker. And this takes virtually everything from Drumline you twit.
2021-04-07 15:29:12,wallstreetbets,"Tracking on all, and agreed. Cheers, see ya on the moon."
2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,The AIR FORCE NUCLEAR WEAPON CENTER apparently proposed a sole-source contract to Palantir Technologies. 
2021-04-06 20:45:54,wallstreetbets,"It feels like PLTR is going to be the company that creates Skynet, but as long as the stock goes up, I'm still in. Maybe in this timeline, instead of annihilating humanity in nuclear fire, Skynet will annihilate the shorts."
2021-04-06 21:17:49,wallstreetbets,"Remember that one time you bought 1000 PLTR for $9.93 and sold it for $13 thinking youre a king, only to buy it back for $22... I do.."
2021-04-06 23:22:44,wallstreetbets,PLTR - Please Let This Rise
2021-04-07 00:54:45,wallstreetbets,"Someone once aptly put it ""PLTR can solve all our past, present and future problems and that would still already be priced in."""
2021-04-06 21:36:24,wallstreetbets,"So thats good news, but no one should expect and one contract announced by Palantir to translate into huge gains.  This is a defense contractor and a long play.  Daily updates are great, I guess , but the tendy man is years away on this play."

2021-04-06 20:20:45,wallstreetbets,So...we're expecting PLTR to crater tomorrow /s
2021-04-06 22:24:01,wallstreetbets,Sweet zombie Jesus let this contract’s dollar amount start with a B instead of a M.

2021-04-06 22:54:53,wallstreetbets,Sounds about right lol. But would be nice if it could pop off and get back over $30 again

2021-04-06 22:15:33,wallstreetbets,I suppose one is more for thjngs like nuclear energy and the other is for weapons
2021-04-06 23:08:20,wallstreetbets,">It feels like PLTR is going to be the company that creates Skynet,

Clearly Misdirection. I have heard rumblings of a Billionaire deploying a large number of satellites in the Sky to create a Net.

Unrelated...I have been upvoting Boston Dynamics videos, and taking extra care of my electronics in front of my Ring ~~in case~~ they are watching."
2021-04-06 21:41:00,wallstreetbets,"Wait, your PLTR stock goes up?"
2021-04-06 23:02:40,wallstreetbets,Or how about selling $13/$14 CC’s when the price was $8 and watching it blow past those strikes and have to buy them back
2021-04-06 23:43:22,wallstreetbets,I’m grateful for my Roth IRA account not allowing CCs. Otherwise I’d have screwed up already trying to pick pennies in front of a steamroller.

2021-04-07 00:55:49,wallstreetbets,Except not /s
2021-04-06 23:32:20,wallstreetbets,They would rather reinvest in sky taxis then buy back shares.
2021-04-07 09:30:33,wallstreetbets,Yeah but their IP has value that isn't reflected on their balance sheet.
2021-04-07 04:43:37,wallstreetbets,Air force has a stargate program. Operating so many SG teams is very costly.
2021-04-07 00:57:28,wallstreetbets,Or grow the business.
2021-04-06 21:16:47,wallstreetbets,I work at a job that makes just the gun barrels for the military. ONLY GUN BARRELS. I get paid 20 an hour for really light work with no college degree and I've only been there 2 years. Military spending is the shit yo.

2021-04-06 23:39:31,wallstreetbets,You're pretty confused about what socialism is. Heres a hint. It's not military spending in republican districts.

The GME election shareholder meeting is June 11, and the DD said they aren't allowed to recommend a share recall until a maximum of 60 days before the meeting, which is April 12.

Only lenders can force a recall, but GME can recommend it so the true share owners don't miss their chance to vote."

2021-04-06 21:31:29,wallstreetbets,"When I say lenders, I mean people/institutions who own the shares and loaned them out to be borrowed. They can recall the shares, which means ""give it back because I don't want you to borrow it anymore.""

If they try to recall shares, but the borrower has shorted the borrowed share, then the shorts must buy the stock back at *any* price so they can give it back to the lender, and the subsequent spike in share price is called a short squeeze. Lenders recalling shares is the whole goal we're trying to achieve."
2021-04-07 00:21:53,wallstreetbets,"True that. I learned a long time ago notbyo torture myself with ""what if"" bullshit.

Disconnect is I think of myself as a shareholder, not a lender, bet im not alone.

The risk of GME mooning past 818 is small compared to the gain from the rapid decay of that 800c. It's the largest premium with the lowest risk. The only catch is to find someone dumb enough to buy it.

===========TRADING DAY, WEDNESDAY APRIL 7=====================

TSLA GANG, today was choppy af. TSLA went for the gap fill almost to 661, but held up at 666-669 (which may be possible support for a gap up tomorrow IF no market BS comes up). Looking for a gap up to 690+ run up to touch 700. If TSLA bulls are strong along with the rest of the market, we can fight for the 700 line and end the week 720+. That's my take but then again I'm -40% deep in more retarded calls so hopefully law of attraction works and papa musk hears my prayers.

Locked in gains with ROKU calls and puts early on. Steep drop followed by a quick V recovery because I was playing both ROKU and TSLA calls and puts.

https://preview.redd.it/t4qs5dggatr61.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=678d8e9ab5e1f1eef4f981f9715c15eafee6ac65

Went in quick AMZN $2900 puts 4/16, in hindsight should've held it to anticipate sell off/breakdown towards EOD. I was too fixated on TSLA and ROKU.

https://preview.redd.it/aq3e5rqlatr61.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=bed4bc90936d8cfdc5ea17e200ea0f33caa5c677

&#x200B;

Like a retard, I kept adding on to my TSLA 700c 4/9 position and screenshoted this at  2:10 PM EST but failed to exit. Guess what happened after?

https://preview.redd.it/u2adga1watr61.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=808d39ae99f53cc45f57d56120182c165000dc73

Market sold off + TSLA trying to fill that gap to 661. Ended up holding these bad boys ayyy. That's what happened when you don't follow the golden rule;

IF ITS GOOD ENOUGH TO SCREENSHOT, ITS GOOD ENOUGH TO SELL. Had unloaded and took that -5% loss up there\^, I wouldn't 1. hold this massive fucking bag, and 2. rebuy the 4/16 calls to give me some time even if I believe in the bounce back up / gap up. Hell I could've yolo'd 230k worth with a cost of $3.  


My numbers plugged into Options Profit Calculator: [http://opcalc.com/sYl](http://opcalc.com/sYl)  
I suggest everyone learn how to use this so you can gauge the next day. Plug in your calls/and IV to get the most accurate numbers.  


Point your finger at April 8 column and go down to 690. If TSLA is at $690, my position is up 6.84% and so on. If TSLA would've done a end of day rally to say 685-690 or past the high of day to 695, then my position would be 50-98% up.. But it didn't so now I'm bagholding

2021-04-06 22:08:28,wallstreetbets,"lmfaoooo. I'm laughing irl because today was the FIRST day I started playing both sides of TSLA with calls and puts AND I hit the vape. 

The entire trading day was literally slo mo for me because I was faded as fuck.

To give insight: I honestly can't tell IF I am truly retarded or that I'm used to how TSLA moves because of an entire year of rollercoaster trading it...

I did have a hiatus/trading break for a few months because I got the covid and other responsibilities kept me from actively trading/observing the market.

I came back March 5th after TSLA dropped bigly. After seeing March 8th dip to $560~ and buying in, I saw the resistance levels at $690, $700, $710 (Tradingview charts will show it but it's quite obvious even by observation) 

Everytime TSLA made a move for $690/700/710, it would immediately get crushed down to lower support levels $680, $660, even $600 before bouncing back up. These were observations throughout March.

EVERY trading day is different and the overall market conditions / news also needs to be taken into account.

But to keep it short/simple- I.. believe it or not browse wsb/stocktwits like a true autist to gauge other retard's sentiments. 

News: They smashed deliveries/productions numbers and it was ""unexpected"" for everyone, bulls and bears, retards and analysts. Regardless, this is a little catalyst to get this little retard train chugging ALONG with SPY highs, QQQs rallying, April bullish month, run up to ERs. 

All of these factors are BULLISH for TSLA. Fuck what people say about PEs and valuations and all that nonsense. Literally doesn't matter here- the argument of comparing TSLA with other car companies is invalid. If you're a TSLA trader you have to understand TSLA GOES UP, but it also goes down just as fast. It's heavily shorted, a fuck ton of degens play TSLA options which attributes to the volatility, short squeezes and gamma squeezes.


Max pain: This stock is HEAVILY controlled by MMs to make as much money burning weeklies calls/puts. I've seen TSLA close BELOW $700, 2 weeks in a row just to fuck over all the call volumes.

Google says:
The Maximum Pain theory states that an option's price will gravitate towards a max pain price, in some cases equal to the strike price for an option, that causes the maximum number of options to expire worthless.

Max pain theory: http://maximum-pain.com/options/TSLA

For example today:

I would buy $690 puts whenever TSLA is around $695-700. I accumulated puts for the lowest price possible in 5-10 contract increments. I anticipated TSLA is gonna flush/sell off towards end of day along with SPY/QQQs. At that point I would close my puts and pick up cheap $700 weeklies to anticipate a gap up the next day.

But throughout the day, on every dip to support $680, 685, I load up on $700 calls- and unload when it gets close to $695-700, aiming for 10-15%. I'm not holding in hopes of a big runner. If it runs, and I miss out, oh well. If I do chase, I chase small. Either way I just commit to it- by the time I hesitate, the trades over and I'm bagholding or FOMOing

Hope that helps- been a long day so my thoughts are scattered a bit lol"
2021-04-07 05:01:07,wallstreetbets,"Thank you lol, yeah some drops are brutal to sit through"
2021-04-07 15:44:54,wallstreetbets,"got tossed around in the chop, next thing I know I'm 200k deep in 700c 4/9 lmfaoooo, -40%"

same. got tossed around in the chop, next thing I know I'm 200k deep in 700c 4/9 lmfaoooo, -40%"
2021-04-07 05:12:36,wallstreetbets,I also have TDA. Thinking about getting esignal+lightspeed. RH will be gone soon
2021-04-07 01:53:47,wallstreetbets,Bruh you gotta get off RH hahaha

Congrats, and fuck you."
2021-04-07 05:53:03,wallstreetbets,"Do you set stop losses, how much do you allow yourself to lose?"
2021-04-07 16:15:35,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the update. Was looking for confirmation bias for my 700c 680c 4/16. Lol
2021-04-07 16:08:27,wallstreetbets,"haha, NYCE! i'm hoping for a bounce back tomorrow to counter today's action. but, unless Elon pulls a rabbit out of his ass to explain the delays on new S and X deliveries, the 🌈🐻 are likely to get away with holding the $700 and even the $690 line this week. i hope i'm wrong :)

expecting to see a recovery towards $800 as we get closer to earnings, followed by the usual dip, followed by ""who the fuck knows"" on/after actual ER day.

not financial advise, just throwing my own shit takes out there, as i'm glad to see another ape actively playing the $TSLA rollercoaster."
2021-04-06 23:59:41,wallstreetbets,I've traded for a bit but newer to tsla. I have learned using StochRSI and RSI help time an entry pretty nicely when using the 5 and 15 minute. if Stoch lines cross under on both time frames you can get a nice scalp especially if you're buying close to the money and use your support and resistances.
2021-04-07 05:00:41,wallstreetbets,"Lmao yea, I have a larger account on TDA. I like the simple RH UI even though they're fucking me from behind"
2021-04-07 01:50:39,wallstreetbets,During the bull run
2021-04-07 05:58:30,wallstreetbets,"No stop losses. It's tough because my risk tolerance is high and I think I can sit through a -50% loss and either average down to salvage it on a big rip, or just cut immediately if I feel it's a total loser and lost cause.

Dealing with losses is something I continually work on AS well as learning to exit in a timely fashion. Entries and exits need to be done mechanically and systematically.

I have this bad habit of.. doing 50-100 contracts at a time. I made a small change where I would precisely buy in 10-25 increments once I gauge a general range. Sometimes I'll see what's the lowest cost for that contract for the day and set limits 25-50 cents below it. People will say it's dangerous to catch falling knives.. I like knives."
2021-04-07 05:01:19,wallstreetbets,"I'll give this a try, thank you"
2021-04-07 07:51:13,wallstreetbets,"Grats brother!

Also trade journaling is important. It makes you accountable and less emotional about the game."
2021-04-06 21:01:20,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, that’s all me baby. Took a bath on my 50 $400 SPY calls for 4/9 that would have put me up +30k and counting. Sold for a loss instead because I’m retarded. Though I gotta be honest I didn’t expect it to just blast straight through $400. Didn’t even take a whole trading day to break it."

2021-04-06 22:50:04,wallstreetbets,"I just recently figured this one out. When you roll, you set a limit price of what your net debit (or credit, if you’re rolling to cheaper options) is and the brokerage does the rest in a single step.

So let’s say you want to roll 5 $10 contracts into 10 $6 contracts that are currently priced at $4.80 and $6.25. That will cost you a total of $100. So you set a limit order for a net debit of $100 and it does the work for you. It monitors both prices at the same time and processes the order so you pay no more than $100. It could sell 5 at $10 and buy 10 at $6, or it can sell 5 at 10.50 and buy 10 at $6.00 (which would only cost you $75) or any combination that equals no more than $100 additional from you. It’s great for fast-moving, volatile options so you don’t miss out on a spike or dip in either one and don’t have to worry about timing two different transactions."
2021-04-07 01:28:40,wallstreetbets,"If the call is deep in the money, it loses all time value and just becomes (share price - strike price) x 100. If you roll into an OTM strike at a later date (assuming you're bullish on the stock) you can make more extrinsic value plays."
2021-04-06 23:05:59,wallstreetbets,"and really simple terms:

he buys some way Out-of-the-Money (OTM) calls, stock price goes up, people are willing (and lol in some cases when shorting on margin, FORCED) to buy those contracts from him for more money than he paid. 

if stock price goes down, he can still sell those contracts at a loss and get some money back instead of waiting for them to expire.

I.E. he can close his position at a gain or a lose, it is dependent on the value of the stock when he opened his position vs the stock value when he closed position.

calls that are OTM have a high potential to lose a lot of value the closer they get to expiry."
2021-04-07 03:05:52,wallstreetbets,"Same question, thank you."
2021-04-07 11:52:48,wallstreetbets,because calls are instant money if the stock price rises faster than the value of the options decay. Its  EZ MONEY.

2021-04-07 10:51:01,wallstreetbets,"There are many ways to put this, but here is a simple one.

The less money you have, the higher % of that amount must go to sustain yourself. Cost of food and rent is everything if you have 10k. It's nothing if you have one million, assuming you don't start living like a king before you make your next million.

There is also so many more opportunities that you just can't jump on if you don't have a lot of money to spend. 

Any investment that multiplies a small sum does less than any investment that multiplies a large sum. Even accounting for risk there are plenty of low risk investments that will do more for you with a million than working extra few dozen hours on a normal wage."

I have to go try selling calls soon(And 0%/Low-Risk investment strategies - and start testing the other side... As an optimist who made 25k-40k off GME his 2nd week of doing calls, I really overestimated the market and the power of calls...

2021-04-07 03:50:24,wallstreetbets,"My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with a low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen-year-old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink. He would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. 

My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds; pretty standard really. At the age of twelve I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Wilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum... it's breathtaking. I suggest you try it."

Perhaps it is the simple fact that if they had simply bought into GME at that $40 price they would've seen more gains than on any of their other trades and it is just their bitter jealously manifesting itself. 

""It has to be over, it has to be"" they think to themself as PLTR drops another percent. 

But then that intrusive thought enters ""...but how did it reach $280 last month""

""No, I'm right and they're wrong, I better keep letting them know on Reddit"""

It's a former Google X project that has a lot of funding and Gates/GOOG backing. The energy storage game is set to explode and cheap grid scale firms like this will dominate. Sure, there are others but not with these kind of resources behind them. 

The extra potential for thermal energy storage facilities is to boost existing fossil power plant output by harnessing all the energy thrown away in cooling towers. 

Just something to watch as the energy transformation hits full stride in the next decade.

*Angry bagholders sending him death threats once they realize what happened... like whatshisface on rGME. Again, best to wait.*

I learned a long time ago that people can be complete pieces of shit with money despite being tolerable otherwise, and I'll never lend anyone money again.

2021-04-06 23:14:27,wallstreetbets,"Tides are turning on GME?  I’m kinda shocked.  The volume has disappeared, the stock is holding hard as fuck at 180-190, management is completely revamped, and the laws are turning against the shorts.  Nobody knows shit about WTF the future holds.  It could be a Chinese invasion tomorrow and you could be paying taxes in the yen next year for all we know.  

I do know this.  GME is a very high risk play but with high risk... can be high reward.  That and don’t forget, the squeeze was stopped by the market makers.  

Far from over, you’re not a believer and that’s ok. What’s no ok is you telling people they fucked up when you don’t know yet, or what these peoples position is.  Sounds like to me you never made any money on GME.  The people who made money on GME are still in some way or another.  

Or I’m wrong, tell me about your story of making money on GME?

Edit:  also I like the choice of words “part of” the real squeeze.  And use your damn periods!!"

Which is fun to watch but ultimately theres not much there. **Stanley Tucci** is only in it for a bit but he’s got a nice scene thats worth seeing. 

**Jeremy Irons** runs a board meeting that might just make the whole movie worth watching.

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Key differences between RKT and ASO I''m seeing a lot of posts on ASO, with some of them comparing to the RKT situation in early March. I want to clarify a few key differences here. This post is NOT saying ASO is a bad investment, I'm sure their excellent earnings indicate that their business is going strong. I'm only trying to show that, in my opinion, a RKT-like gamma squeeze is *unlikely*.

So first thing, we have to understand that the RKT squeeze is primarily a gamma squeeze - the price blew up 20% initially, getting close to the highest strikes available at the time, and then steadily grew to over 70% over the course of the day. If you look at the share cost distribution (below), you will notice a big block between \~$28 to \~$40. I've been tracking this since the squeeze and it has not changed. What happened was that institutions were selling naked calls (because RKT was trading flat forever before the spike), and they were forced to buy shares to hedge, creating a gamma squeeze. Institutional holdings recorded at the end of dec was about 74%, suggesting that there could have been a good number of exposed naked calls. If it were primarily driven by a short squeeze, this big block would not exist.

https://preview.redd.it/7x37a6m7olr61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18a030afd647c5d87ef3fff2f618483452de072d

On the other hand, what is ASO's situation? ASO has 91.6% institutional ownership. I would suspect most of the calls that are sold are already covered. ASO has been trending up since its IPO anyways so there wouldn't be as many naked thetagang as RKT before the spike. Thus, I highly doubt a gamma squeeze can happen. What about a short squeeze? Of course this can happen as the short interest is high, but unless millions of apes jump in like GME (unlikely since they are already in GME) or a whale buys in (also highly highly unlikely). The high institutional ownership also means that lots of shares will be available to be lent out, and shorts will have a hell of a time if any spike happens.

With this in mind, investors in ASO should tread lightly. I would probably suggest getting shares if you are bullish and not options."
2021-04-07 04:57:58,wallstreetbets,I just like guns tf $aso
2021-04-06 20:53:11,wallstreetbets,I think it’s valid to point out no two situations are identical. Is this going to go parabolic one day and dump the next? Maybe. Or it might slowly build 30-50% gains in two weeks and find a new floor for a while.
2021-04-07 08:13:01,wallstreetbets,"Wasn't $RKT's ""squeeze"" technically just day traders, MSM, and retail investors just hitting the stock at the same time? It wasn't actually a ""squeeze"" it just looked like one. $RKT hasn't moved by $0.30 since, even with the influx of posts on it on this sub a couple weeks ago. Retail investors I don't think contributed over all to the short-lived rise of the stock. Whales just followed the money based on popularity."
2021-04-06 20:55:56,wallstreetbets,Solid edit and valid points. UWMC is a good counter example. Enormous float making gamma squeeze difficult.

Me being cautious, I would start with 10% of what you are willing to invest in it. And buy 10% more every 10% drop. Or something similar. 

Just from a quick browse at recent history, you could guess that it's more likely to hit $20 again before it hits $24.

Could they announce that they leaked confidential data from 500K customers on a Friday afternoon and get a 40% spike by Monday? Yes. Is it likely? Also yes."

2021-04-07 04:19:13,wallstreetbets,The price sitting around the $180 mark for a few weeks now reminds me of when it was around $50.
2021-04-06 20:39:02,wallstreetbets,"A drop like that could trigger another high volume squeeze. 

The fact that it sits at around 200 keeps the volume low by making retail think twice before yoloing.

This is especially true if we still see 350 as the (self Fulfilling) point of most resistance. Its less than a 100% gain, which for GME is incredibly low. 

All these high gain posts popping up are an attempt to eat at our risk/reward mechanisms and put us off hitting that buy button when we see a dip >100."

I've had this exact same thought, and there certainly is a lot of fallacious thinking here. BUT, this GME biz seems like an extremely unique form of it where that might be an okay thing. Rather than seeing folks who think differently as literally satanic demons, it's just about buying and holding a stock they like. The endgame of that is actually awesome.

Hell, the squeeze doesn't even need to be real for apes to cause a squeeze by expecting a squeeze, since so much of the float is now in diamondhands. It could be a self-fulfilling prophecy in the best of ways."

2021-04-06 22:46:29,wallstreetbets,"There is no God. We're all Atheists at birth... until someone else convinces us to believe in some hocus pocus bullshit to fit into a (their) ""tribe"". Usually it's during childhood, when there is little defense against indoctrination and psychological manipulation. Religious people grow up to believe what was done to them was a positive thing, and then they continue the tradition of ideological brain-binding with their children in turn.

What we have now, around the world, is successive generations of fully adult human beings still believing in what amounts to the Easter Bunny. Simply because to escape that mental state - unwavering faith - would mean confronting the reality that their entire worldview, the core beliefs of their ""tribe"" (including friends and family and associates) are predicated on mass delusion.

So it's natural to react with fear and anger at someone who not only doesn't believe, but shrugs off the best efforts of the religious to change their minds. The mere existence of an atheist is a perceived as a threat to the sanctity of the unquestionable dogma and mythology of religion.

Meanwhile to atheists, religious people just sound like... well, I'll put it this way... you know how Qanon people sounded to the rest of the world? That's what religious people sound like when you aren't a part of the delusion. It's difficult to put a positive spin on it. I don't place religious folks any higher than flat-earthers in the hierarchy of relative social value/contribution, as a function of their misinformed perspectives... actually a net negative, if you really think about it."

The blockbuster thesis was real until the last couple years when activist investors took interest and started a turnaround.  100% idiotic board, which didn't even bother closing down duplicate stores from the EB acquisition.  Currently closing the stores and leading to lower growth, obviously, cuz they are trying to shrink.  

Revenue decline is the same, as the gaming sector is tied to the console cycle.  Peaks during release and steadily drops afterwards.  
This year is the start of a new cycle and with so much debt repaid early, lower overall revenue (from fewer stores!) means overall healthier financials.  Especially with the growth of the e-commerce division starting to leverage the rewards membership.  

The underlying reason for the GME saga is boomers and suits fundamentally not understanding gaming or gamers."

The problem is, of course, that dumb teenagers don't know when they're being made fun of, so they gleefully joined in. And a couple of them is OK - it gives the non-teens meme fodder (eg. ""holds up spork""). But then there's an inflection point where the dumb teens outnumber the original members and it's not fun anymore. You're not making fun of idiots with other non-idiots anymore, now you're just talking to idiots. So more of the original folks leave, and the ratio skews even further. Cue anger, spinoff sites, fragmentation.

WSB has a lot of the same problems. Using terms like retards, autists, cucks ironically attracts the people who use them unironically. The fragmentation has already begun, but fortunately it started with the GME crowd splitting off, so given strong enough moderation maybe there's a chance."

GameStop has no place in either of those. GameStop is just entering a market that all of their competitors have been in for over a decade, and they don’t offer any advantages.

Why would the big 3 even allow them to have a separate store on their platforms?  

You don’t go to a 3rd party retailer to get your Big Mac, you buy it straight from the source.  The less middlemen the less the price.  And McDonald’s certainly isn’t going to allow Burger King to sell cheeseburgers in their restaurants.

Rewards programs are a dime a dozen, there is nothing special about GameStop’s that anyone else couldn’t duplicate, and ps+ and gamepass have given me far more bang for my buck that GameStop rewards ever has.

People get all bent out of shape when you talk about GameStop not being a sound company.  This doesn’t mean your shitting on the current play.  It’s like people are scared that if we don’t convince everyone that GME is a long term play then this squeeze won’t happen.

  This is a short squeeze play, not a long term investment.  Pretty much everyone understands that the GameStop experience isn’t enjoyable and doesn’t fill any niche.  As someone who’s been a hardcore gamer my entire life and been in GameStop countless times I have always hated the company, found it slimy and predatory, and so does everyone I know.  It doesn’t even have a good reputation it can leverage."

And another tip, don’t conflate spirituality with religion. Totally different things, and a spiritual atheist is a real concept. The difference is spiritually comes from within. 

You can find purpose and a sense of inter-connectedness between all life and the universe and still believe in evolution and the atom.

You can also be an atheist who accepts that “Hey it would be great if their is a higher power, and maybe it’s not intelligent, but it might be purposeful. However, I choose to treat the world as deterministic and based on the laws of nature.”

Who works off the data given to them by the people who would rather NOT let it be known that they did NOT cover? So they ""covered"" and somehow still rocketed again in february off a relatively meaningless announcement. And since then the volatility has been unattached to its volume, no fundamental logic applies to GME. What we do see is constant FUD trying to be kind and generous people to make me sell GME. Where do we see that for any other stock in history? 

 There's also massive volume being held. It's not just apes. We are not so coordinated. There are clearly smarter larger parties playing GME to their advantage and it's going to come to ahead. Just  watch how the ticker price fights over strike prices every friday as it has for the last 3 weeks. That's not normal, and that's not just apes. That's coordinated actions by someone so big they literally control millions of shares themselves. 

Honestly there are no hard truths about GME because the market is so fucking opaque we know nothing. Sure the official reports say they covered, but that's meaningless if it can neither be confirmed by a third party nor if the shorters themselves could just lie and hide the truth at no risk. 

If you choose to believe they covered then fine, but understand that's really no better than trusting any random Joe at this point. I'm not going to take the word of a spineless organization, the sec issued a paltry 250k fine the other day to a billion dollar company. That's laughable.

I know our bodies rot, our brains cease all activity, and our memory lives on in others while our DNA lives on in the cells of our children.

Would it make sense to claim we are reincarnated as some fish somewhere in the Pacific? Maybe we head down to the underworld and face Hades and Cerberus. Or maybe we float up to mystical sky wizard land and go through the pearly gates. Or maybe Set and Ra and Anubis don't give a shit because we aren't pharaohs and had insufficient offerings in our burial chambers, and ignore our wispy shade selves in the afterlife, forever.

They all make about the same amount of sense. They all have about the same amount of rational logic behind them. They all have equal weight in the likelihood of which is most probably the truth.

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"BlackBerry: How the Patent Sale could transform BB On March 30, BlackBerry has reported Q4 and FY21 results/call AH. At first the market didn't like it and on the next trading day the stock lost 10% (panic mode, loss porn and so on). However within the next 2 trading days BB has regained all its $ in a quick reversal. I'm here to tell you why.

This is a followup to [my OP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/mhi3ev/blackberry_earningscall_were_actually_bullish/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) 

^(Quick note to the Mods: I believe my OP is about to bring new original content to the discussion and hopefully will be eligible to live its life as a post.)

**Portfolio Patent Sale (big $$$)**

Quick refresh: the stock fell because the revenue came below expectations but straightaway the company said it happened because they are currently negotiating the sale of a portion of their patents specifically related to ***mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking.*** Consequently they had to voluntarily limit the monetisation of these patents during Q4.

The points I would like to investigate are: for how much $$ this sale could go, how likely this sale is to happen, who could be the buyer and when could it be completed?

***First the money.*** CEO Chen during the call: *we will report a one-time gain of a reasonably big number, followed by a tail of up to seven years.* He also confirmed the yearly revenues for Licensing are around $250m. And that BB owns 38,000 patents. I will simply use these numbers with a DCF to estimate what that ""big number"" could be. Before I proceed I would like to emphasise that CEO also said: *we believe that the completion of the transaction will be beneficial to our shareholders* (if it happens).

Assuming a 10% discount rate and 7 years of revenue life, we have $250m current year, $227m next year, $207m (...) to $141m for the final year. For a total of **$1,339bn.** That's quite a pleasing big number but let's be careful nonetheless: we don't know the size of the portfolio being negotiated and the payment is expected to be initially a lump sum  + 7years of tail royalties. So they could tweak it a bit.

With a 15% discount rate we get **$1,196bn** and at 20% **$1,081bn.** Another way to look at it: if we consider that they would sell only 75% of that side business and we discount it at 10% we still get a number north of a billion $ (consistent with CEO comment: *it's a major portion of our portfolio*). So money wise should the sale indeed happen we are looking at an one time cash flow of $1bn to $1.3bn. Not too shabby for a $5bn market cap company with already $800m cash in its hands (yes they could have momentarily circa 40% cash to mkt cap ratio).

***Is this really happening?*** There is a high probability it would maybe 80% but it's not cleared yet. To get to this conclusion I listened twice to the conf call to try to decipher the clues. Whenever CEO was talking about the amount he sounded as if that part was near completion (*will be a big number* and *the majority of the deal will come in one-time early, but there is a tail that goes on*). Although he also stated that *the company has not yet reached a definitive binding agreement and negotiations are ongoing.*

The main hurdle might be the regulatory review of the transaction as the big boss mentioned that in the most conservative scenario: *we assume that negotiation and regulatory review continue for the first half* (of FY). A sentence that directly leads me to believe that the buyer could be a major company.

***Big money buyer:*** if there is a lengthy regulatory review it might be because the potential purchaser could be in a position to infringe antitrust laws (NB: antitrust laws were created by Congress to preserve competition among businesses and prevent any one business from dominating a single industry and building a monopoly). 

Speculations are ongoing that the buyer could be Facebook. It's honestly hard to say but that's the name with the higher odds at the moment. Just to recall BB sued FB in 2018, claiming the social media giant was using BlackBerry inventions in its messaging applications. Then they settled the dispute in January 2021 over patent royalties for terms that weren’t disclosed. You see the analogy here. By the way during the conf call this settlement was never mentioned and we still didn't see the financial repercussions in BB accountancy.

That said it could very well be someone else from North America, which leads us to the when.

***The timing of the sale*** is honestly hard to guess but again let's refer to the CEO comment that in their most conservative scenario the discussions could continue during H1. Subjectively I tend to believe that it would happen sooner rather than later because 1. they are losing money by restricting their Licensing every day that goes by and 2. it was *the* major statement in their whole conference call. You can arguably think that you would release this kind of communication when negotiations are very advanced. If I had to bet I would say it's a matter of a few weeks obviously subject to the regulatory approval.

**The Transformation**

By now unless if you've been living on Mars because that game rocket took you too far, you must know that BlackBerry is no longer an handset company. They excel at cybersecurity, they are deeply involved in the automotive industry including EV thanks to QNX and they are coming big hand in hand with Amazon to bring IVY to the world (October early release and Feb22 full product).

If and when they sell that side portfolio to a potentially big name you can expect all financial and traditional media to report the transaction and to emphasise the renewal, the rebirth of BlackBerry as an Internet of Things, Cybersecurity high-margins long-duration Tech company.

In terms of communication they have just started and they are about to splash the cash to continue on. John Chen is quite excited about it: *you will see us being more aggressive, in fact we ran an ad today Intelligent Security everywhere, an ad today. I just saw it on the New York Times and so we're just going to step-up in both people and spending and resources to go after the market and it is a huge, as you know very well, it is a huge market and no clear winner at this point.*

He later added that: *we have a reasonably large number of hires mostly in sales and marketing.*

***IVY is not priced in at all:*** there is no other way to say it. At the current BB valuation investors are totally ignoring the potential of IVY, probably because they don't understand it. Let me go straight to the point.

*BB and AWS said the new intelligent vehicle data platform, called IVY, will compress the time to build, deploy and monetize in-vehicle applications and connected services across multiple brands and models, making it easier for automakers to collaborate with a wider pool of developers to accelerate development of apps and services.*

The goal is to establish IVY as a standard platform across the auto industry, as Apple and Google have done in mobile phones through their iOS and Android platforms. This way IVY could be the equivalent of the App Store but for all mobility platforms whether EV, autonomous driving EV, air drones, rockets (SpaceX already using QNX) etc. The end uses are potentially limitless and most of the current discussed applications are under NDAs. Once they start to pop out, the picture will get clearer and clearer.

Similarly to what Apple did back in the days, BB has started an IVY Fund with $50m in it + $100K AWS credit for new startups willing to develop a product on IVY. Let's also not forget that the deal was approved by Andy Jassy in December who later got upgraded from AWS big boss to Amazon CEO. We can reasonably imagine that he values IVY as a potential disruptor and Chen sees it as a *significant growth opportunity.* Initially thought to hit the market in 2023, the early release will be available as soon as October 2021 (again the market is sleeping on this advancement).

One quick word on the cybersecurity part of the business: BB and CRWD have roughly the same yearly revenue (I will leave it to the experts to discuss how comparable they are). One company has $5bn market cap and the other $44bn.

**The Bear Case**

If the sale doesn't happen at all that's gonna look bad and hurt financially. Still according to the call, *full year licensing revenue will be in the region of $100 million* (if the sale fail) vs an usual $250m per year. As mentioned throughout that's because they are limiting the Licensing revenue while negotiating. Cybersecurity growth, QNX and IVY will still remain in play but more as mid and long term catalysts. They would still push for sales and marketing but the blue sky scenario obviously implies the receipt of a billion $ in cash in exchange of their accessory patents.

*Definitely not a recommendation to buy, hold, sell any security. Besides I have no knowledge in IoT, programming, software etc. I can only read.*

*Disclosure: long BB shares and June 20C and 15C (in that order).*

**TLDR:** BB is selling their old business patents probably for more than $1bn to a big player in order to focus on their new business model - cybersecurity, IoT, QNX, IVY - and come back like what's up."
2021-04-06 20:13:21,wallstreetbets,"Rival, I think the $100M annual revenue is a dead go away to the size of the deal.  

Licensing revenue wasn’t zero this quarter.  
Far from it.  It was merely down.

Chen said we could assume that the deal will be replaced by $100M in annual revenue.

As a result, using a discount rate of 10%, HRs saying that the all in deal is worth around $1B.

If day half is up front and half is along the 7 year tail, it could be something like $650M up front and upto $100M annually for 7 years thereafter.  (Ballpark, discounted over 7 yrs)

This is still an amazing chunk of change, obviously, and will help them fuel marketing and IVY initiatives which are the REAL investment here.  

Also, as with any parent portfolio, most patents are trash / worthless.  Max 10% have any value and 10-50 (in messaging, networking, etc) that are super valuable in that they are worth defending through litigious processes.  

All in all, GREAT post, rival.  
$BB will a late 2021 story as it’s core businesses (cybersecurity / IVY develop), but this patent sale will be the one large catalyst between now and then.  

What will be interesting is if FB or the suitor tried to take a stake in the IVY deal.  As in, AMZN, B.B., FB 50/40/10.  Could happen."

2021-04-06 20:06:01,wallstreetbets,"Great DD. Required reading for those looking seriously at the stock!

I agree it is highly likely its Facebook that is buying the patents. If there is no big bump in patent revenue this quarter from the so called settlement, and Chen has basically said there won't be, then the settlement is the sale in my opinion.

I think this is being held up by the Canadian Gov't for national security reasons as has happened in the past.I am 90% certain the deal is done and the only thing that will change its value would be the Gov't insisted some patents were removed from the sale."

Great DD !!

On **IVY** \- absolutely, as you point out, barely anyone is paying serious attention in particular discounting into the valuation. It's pretty obvious IVY will work and more question of what degree. John Wall spoke at CITI and JPM Conferences in January and on April 1st on a conference call entitled *'How U.S. and Chineses corporations collaborate in growing autonomous vehicles*'. Here are some choice quotes (or paraphrases) he made during these:

* *'The response from automanufacturers has been ""overwhelming""'.*
* *'These are sitting on a ""goldmine of data"" '.*
* *""We are seeing that the use cases are unending"".*
* *""Your imagination is the limit"".*

John Wall is not a spinmaster and seems low key. He also underlined there's been lots of dialogue / exchanges with these (so he's not dreaming). 

On **Valuation** \- Yes there are quite a few known names that are used as comparables and many are valued at 10x BB even though they have similar or less revenue. The most often cited is solid but not ten times as solid and longer term not nearly as interesting, nor with potential of BB. Here is one interesting metric we can thank Bill Gates for. Almost to the day 10 years ago FB had a user base of 50 million and NO revenues. The average FB user, it seems, spends about 35 minutes per day on FB. For a 1.6% stake Bill Gates's MS invested $240 million into FB valuing FB at $15 billion (3 times the value of BB today). This also valued FB at $300 per user. QNX has a user base of over 175 million and growing at about 25 million per year. The average driver is in their car 90 mintes per day. If we ignored all of BB's current business or their potential, and looked only at IVY, BB is valued at close to $25 per user. John Wall previously calrified that IVY will work on the existing installed base of QNX. So much potential yet one does not pay for it at these levels. In fact one basically pays 1/10th some other names. Crazy but won't last.

Thanks again for the excellent DD."

2021-04-07 11:58:56,wallstreetbets,"u/Rivaaal

As to **QNX** and **IVY** and Volvo announcement this AM -

The key that some seem to overlook. BB has stated that revenue from QNX is in range of '*high single digits to low double*' (pressumably $8-$12 range). And it's a one time. To focus on that is missing the point. It is ALL about the installed base.

The insatlled base is 175 million plus (considering it's been growing at approximately 25 million annually and we have not had an updated number in about a year, it is likely safe to assume the installed base is in the vicinity of 200 million).

Note the language in the press release and this excerpt -

""*Volvo Group wanted to take a new approach to software. It wanted to find a single supplier for the operating system (OS) and hypervisor to meet the needs of the ‘whole truck’, capable of supporting safety certification to the highest levels.*

*Following an in-depth proof of concept, Volvo Group decided to build its ‘Volvo Dynamic Software Platform’ (VDSP) on the* [*QNX® OS for Safety*](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-os-for-safety) *and the* [*QNX® Hypervisor for Safety*](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-os-for-safety)*, both* [*certified to ISO 26262:2018 ASIL D*](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications)*.*

*The engagement includes a new flexible use of the QNX OS and Hypervisor for the whole vehicle, which gives developers and architects the freedom to design the best possible system as the company looks at the requirements of the next 15 years, including the future support of autonomous driving and electrification.""*

This is very much the language Blackberry uses when discussing IVY and its appeal to OEMs and automanufacturers.

It is unlikely that a less than serious conversation has already taken place with Scania and Volvo and many others about IVY, it's appeal, and use benifits (keep in mind John Wall stated the ""*use cases are unending*"" and the response has been ""*overwhelming*"").

Once one gets their heads around an installed base and recurring fees from that base, only then can one appreciate the kind of upside that awaits. Too many are just not seeing it. As you state ""IVY is not priced in at all"". In fact you get all this and a whole other package of business at a massive discount to other known names.

Here is another metric that applies to installed bases.

**NFLX** has an installed base of 200 million users worlwide (sort of the same as BB). Of course the business is different but the revenue model maybe not so different to IVY. The average NFLX user coughs over $150 US per annum. Could IVY extract $150 US per annum from its installed base ? How about $100 US or even $5O US ? I would suggest any of these numbers is more than realistic, in particular if we consider what consumers pay for cell phone service, or ISP, or cable TV, etc. The point is there will be some number and any number will be significant to IVY.

Anyone can disagree but this is precisely what BB and AWS have in mind (even ultra conservative Chen mentioned '*recurring revenue*s').

NFLX has a market cap of $250 billion or 50X BB's $5 billion. And this ignores anything else BB is doing.

Paying 10% of what the comps trade at for this kind of upside is crazy rare but I guess many just don't see it yet (including most analysts who continue to miss the boat with their cautious sitting on the fence outlooks).

Is it  possible that Watsa (with $1 billion on the line and an average share price cost of about $14 USD), or Chen (who is already very wealthy and came out of retirement and allocated so far 7 years of his life to this), or the people at AWS (who have already been involved with IVY for two years) don't have this in mind and haven't been executing in that direction ?

Exponential upside is putting it mildly."

2021-04-06 23:05:36,wallstreetbets,"I am with OP and like this DD / exploration of their near future moves. I'm bullish and resetting my limit orders.

However.

>Anything open source is problematic security wise. So much time and investment to work around that problem.

I have to disagree here, it would take one large company sponsoring a few relevant projects, they would be able to cover the cost of code reviews on their available options and pick the best to bring up to commercial quality, all with public eyes on the work.

Then you bolt the bits and pieces together with some proprietary code and you're well on your way to rushing prematurely to market, such is The Way with tech.

In fact partner with a second company experienced in this study of thing, like FEDora Linux and you could do it really quickly and gain public good will too.

Most companies would fuck it up but closed source only gets a security benefit in the press not in real life. We're already popping luxury cars using nothing but digital tech because nobody (usually) but the IP owners and the so-called bad guys have the time or motive to go digging for flaws.

I would never fully trust an off the shelf closed source security system for example, to protect my house and to not already be backdoored for use by, say, feds with a warrant, which might as well be your local beat cops now with the interdepartmental ""knowledge sharing workshops"" they do. Or whatever. It's just an example.

Auto.. is perhaps different and the media ""open source bad"" messaging will probably have good traction in this field. So while I think OPs predictions are sound, don't underestimate the dark horse you haven't even heard of yet."

2021-04-07 00:12:33,wallstreetbets,"SaaS is known for not breaking even until 12-18-24months. 

Its why customer success is a giant industry now. Started with Salesforce leaky bucket problem. They were losing 8% of customers a month. Even after their IPO and shit was supposedly going to the moon, they were filling the bucket slightly faster than it was leaving, but what happens when you run out of new customers to fill the bucket with? 

So how do we keep current customers.... enter customer success. 

Historically Software/hardware sales had long deployments, you could charge for anything. For SaaS its basically the subscription is 68% of revenue (real number, https://media1-production.mightynetworks.com/asset/4189896/WHITEPAPER_Origins_of_Customer_Success.pdf page 4). 

So now you're more focused on keeping the customer. 

Also I think OP isn't considering CAq. Cost of Customer Acquisition. Shit is high as fuck in SaaS especially for smaller companies. The sales reps are paid tons, and then you need to pay engineers, sales engineers, PM, Marketing, CEO, VPs, etc. etc. etc. before you;ve even gotten the customer. 

Super costly. 

But theres a ton to think about from relevant workstreams/experiences."
2021-04-07 16:48:23,wallstreetbets,That is very probable 😂 Point being is by 2025 the price now should be academic and the only hurt would be going back over your trades to see how many shares you could have had with better timing.

The only reason they finally caught it is cause their manager ended up in the hospital and the new hire who covered the office was an out of work accountant noticed a 20k a month deficit in the paperwork.

2021-04-06 21:03:15,wallstreetbets,4/16 10p at market open. This is gonna tank.
2021-04-06 20:52:57,wallstreetbets,"Honestly probably short term so 4/16. I’m only trying to trade the expectation that 60% was an overshot and was also fueled by shorts covering, so they’ll push it down in the morning. Could be wrong of course."

2021-04-06 23:58:47,wallstreetbets,That OI volume didn't proportionally increase for May and out. Would have thought this was pushed for selling those premiums since this had flatlined by staying under 10. I'm thinking they're burning 4/16 calls because the future expiries aren't stacked.

2021-04-06 21:02:07,wallstreetbets,That’s my hope too. You should probably buy calls instead

2021-04-07 02:23:10,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah I had heard similar issues with RIDE but didn’t know details, just looked it up and same thing they were hit with a short report but from Hindenberg in their case. Geez and they are a newer company but look at those GM ties, they basically are a little GM EV baby moved right into a former GM plant, seat on the board, invested cash, integrated into the supply chain.   


I mean even if early hiccups with sales and production, they aren’t gonna fail unless GM gives up on them, and they are committed to building up their EV. So they look less polished and ready than XL but with a strong tie to a big player in auto. Definitely will be watching and possibly adding, thanks for the info."

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NVAX - I liked it at $300 I LOVE it at $180 Please read these two previous posts before you shit on my positions

[1st Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq3ksw/nvax_dont_miss_this_perfect_vaccine_play_headed/)

[2nd Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/luuige/nvax_part_ii_last_call_before_a_shit_ton_of/)

First of all I want to say fucking GUH to my fellow NVAX brethren that have been riding this tendie rollercoaster with me. This is not for the faint of heart but I'm still positive on the outlook of this stock. Here are the negative events that have sent the stock down and my rebuttals to them:

**1) US approval of JnJ vaccine and additional orders of MRNA and PFE** \- The US at this point is pretty loaded with vaccine doses, we have enough as it is without NVAX to vaccinate all the US. This leads to the common misconception that NVAX is too late to the party and has missed out. However, the US is still going to purchase 110 million doses from NVAX no matter what once it is approved. The deal is already made. The US gov funded NVAX to get these doses they will not just refuse to buy them. Despite this I still insist the US market share DOES NOT MATTER. Here are a list of other deals NVAX has lined up

* [SHIT TONS](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-covid-19-vaccine-manufacturing-agreement-serum) of manufacturing deals leading to production of 2+ BILLION doses every year across the world
* [1.1 BILLION dose deal](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-memorandum-understanding-gavi-cumulative) with COVAX the majority of which will be vaccines from NVAX
* [40 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-expanded-collaboration-and-license-agreement) to South Korea
* [6 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-government-switzerland-announce-agreement-principle) to the Swiss
* [76 Million Doses + Manufacturing Deal](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-memorandum-understanding-produce-covid-19) to our Poutine eating brethren
* [51 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-finalizes-agreement-commonwealth-australia-51-million) to Australians
* [10.7 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-agreement-government-new-zealand-107-million) to the Kiwis
* [60 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-uk-government-announce-collaboration-and-purchase) to the British

**2) EU deal talks with NVAX fall apart citing manufacturing concerns -** OK this one sounds bad I admit. Could it be? NVAX can't actually secure enough of its raw materials to make vaccines for the EU? If they can't even do that how are we supposed to expect them to be able to make vaccines for the rest of the world? The truth is that NVAX was the one that refused to sign the deal with the EU. As demonstrated in [this article](https://www.thepavlovictoday.com/andrew-bridgen-mp-the-eu-and-ursula-von-der-leyen-set-out-to-teach-astrazeneca-a-lesson-but-only-shown-that-they-need-to-learn-one-themselves/) the EU has been an incredibly litigious vaccine customer and has made AZ's life hell. Hence why the EU has been [doing poorly](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/06/eu-blames-astrazeneca-failure-for-sluggish-covid-vaccine-rollout) as far as vaccine rollout goes. Basically, NVAX has more than enough customers that are less troublesome than the EU willing to buy their product and NVAX only has so many doses readily available, why sell to the EU when you can sell to others?

&#x200B;

**3) Insider selling** \- If you sell your positions when you see a headline about an insider selling stock you should really reconsider this investing hobby thing and go into buying beanie babies or whatever the fuck you feel more comfortable with because you'll never make money or be able to hug your kids with such fragile paper hands. Execs sell their stock all the time, they schedule selling months ahead of time or just want the money. In fact, NVAX execs were selling their stock at $125 just days before Phase 3 data came out that sent NVAX to $300+. It simply has not been indicative of catastrophic news. 

**4) General market pullback** \- As many of you are aware the market has been extremely rocky in March and NVAX is not immune to this. In fact, being such a high beta stock it is more vulnerable. Biotech has been absolutely slammed by the market in March which makes this a PERFECT buying opportunity.

&#x200B;

Now onto the good stuff - two catalysts I expect this month:

**1) UK Approval -** NVAX has completed its UK Phase 3 trial and the results look GREAT. At 96% efficacy it's the best performing vaccine reported to date. It already had submitted data to the UK as part of a rolling review and should get the approval by the [end of April](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-could-be-approved-by-uk-in-april-evening-standard-says-2021-03-30). I cannot stress this enough, I do **not** think approval has been priced in. This would be the very first approval that NVAX has ever received and will finally validate it as a profitable company with a future. Canada, Australia, and NZ would very shortly follow in approvals if this passes in the UK.

**2) US Phase 3 Results -** This will likely take investors by surprise! NVAX enrolled their phase 3 trial in record time which allowed them to get started much earlier than anticipated. Additionally, with 30,000 participants this trial is much larger than the UK trial and they will likely reach their endpoint targets in much less time than what the UK trial took. In fact, this US phase 3 trial [started crossover studies](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/novavax-to-expand-covid-19-vaccine-trials-to-children-teens-2021-04-05) which potentially indicates the interim endpoints have already been reached AND they are now expanding the trial to include children and teens. We were hoping for a long time that the FDA would use the UK phase 3 data but now we might not even have to wait for that.

&#x200B;

Other positive news/useful info:

**1) This stock has gone through tremendous de-risking.** At $180 a share NVAX is almost down to the price it was before Phase 3 data came out. It can't fall much more, and at a market cap of 12.9 Bn it is grossly undervalued.

**2) Other covid developements -** a) NVAX announced in their earnings call that SA variant trials would begin by the start of the summer and that these would be solely safety-based. If the original vaccine is approved for efficacy these would not have to demonstrate such rigorous efficacy data. b) NanoFlu+Covid or NanoFlu+Covid+RSV vaccine trials are supposed to start by the end of the year.

Positions:

$200c 5/21

$200c 7/16

Price target = $400"
2021-04-06 23:56:16,wallstreetbets,"I've been holding long over a year. Bought a house and still holding. Novavax is derisked except for politics. And, the results are clearly best in class.

2021-04-06 23:54:02,wallstreetbets,I'm just trying starting to try and get my first option trade brain wrinkles so I'm just studying and paper trading options right now but I think these are the highest premiums I have ever seen when it comes to buying options.

2021-04-07 10:13:05,wallstreetbets,Long since Nov 2019. $400 is a good start.
2021-04-07 10:27:51,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been wrecked trying to buy this Dip. Do you think the pop to $330 was mainly short driven? 

I am starting to think the weakness on price is from the longitudinal studies of Pfizer and Moderna coming out and showing efficacy at 6months. Basically if vaccines are that effective the overall market shrinks. 

Also keep in mind moderna valuation is based on their anti cancer pipeline. So I’m not sure we can expect much more than 20B market cap for NVAX. Maybe somewhere near $250-$300 range given market size/share uncertainty"
2021-04-07 19:58:49,wallstreetbets,Ok. I'm holding 200 long at $176. Thinking about buying some calls if it stays down (already burned $3k in NVAX calls last month). What kind of call/timing are you liking? 🚀🚀

It's a bit different to pensions here, as you can pull the money out of an ISA without penalty normally, but you then don't get a credit for the allowance you used up funding it in the first place.

We can put £20k a year I think into ISAs in the UK."

Financial advisors are not gamers. People who play pc games have steam accounts with hundreds of games already. Why would they buy anything from gamestop? 

Additionally, if you think about it, kids who ask for computers are very tech savvy, and they'll be able to find the best fuckin deals. 

I doubt they'll be at gamestop. 

Let me ask you this: how much is best buy worth? Mmhm?

How much is AMD worth? Hmm..??

2021-04-07 01:32:39,wallstreetbets,"That's absolutely Reaganomics... But also what I plan on doing because unless shares are going for 50k a pop, it's not worth withdrawing to pay things like student loan debt.

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A Bet on Canadian Cannabis: The Final Bet TLDR: APHA 4/16 $21C

After blessing you all with the Trilogy ([Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hvfhwg/a_bet_on_canadian_cannabis/), [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j5aqp4/a_bet_on_canadian_cannabis_part_2/), [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kltsat/a_bet_on_canadian_cannabis_part_3/)), it is unfortunately time for our last earnings bet on Aphria. Before jumping down to the comment section to give me your smooth brain opinion on cannabis stocks, please take a second to go fuck yourself. 

Those of you who like to make money take a few minutes to read this DD, as it really doesn’t get easier than this. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mlcyb6/13k_earnings_yolo_on_apha/) is my position. 

Before I even get into the analysis I wanted to take a second to point out the [article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/aphria-revenue-estimates-lowered-by-stifel-ahead-of-q3-earnings-on-weak-cannabis-consumption-trends-2021-04-06?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo) released today by Stifel. They are lowering earnings expectations due to weak cannabis consumption trends, the share price has dropped 4% today likely because of this article. Stifel expects $163M revenue this Q, and has given us a laughably easy expectation to beat, while also giving us a better entry point. 

**Why Stifel is a Joke, My DD**

Last Q revenues were $160M, they need an additional $3M to beat Stifel expectations

Because I think Stifel has the smoothest brain out of anyone reading this, and I hope they are, I’ll start with Cannabis Revenues.

Last Quarter Highlights:

Canada Rec Sales: Sept: $257M, Oct: $270M, Nov: $261M

Total Canada Sales: $788M

Aphria Net Cannabis Revs were $67M last Q

Now according to Stifel there have been weak cannabis consumptions trends, and I’m not entirely sure where they’re getting this info from. I get mine from the Government of Canada who releases [National Sales](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=2010000801&pickMembers%5b0%5d=2.30&pickMembers%5b1%5d=3.1) on a monthly basis, so lets take a look. 

[Dec-Feb this Q  ](https://preview.redd.it/32u2iutsflr61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18deaec8e2154510b5f27264467bf3771158e95c)

Canada Rec Sales: Dec: $290M, Jan $282M, Feb N/A

As far as the first 2 months of the quarter go, cannabis consumption has increased 8.5% QoQ, while Stifel is claiming the opposite, in fact December and January are the 2 highest sales months since cannabis was legalized. Aphria has been the #1 LP in Canada for the last 2 quarters and I expect them to continue to hold their current market share as most of the Canadian growth comes from Ontario, where Aphria holds the largest market share. 

Not only are cannabis sales NOT declining in Canada as Stifel suggests, they seemingly forgot that Aphria is adding another existing business to their books this Quarter. Aphria acquired SweetWater Brewing in November, with the deal closing on November 25. We get a glimpse of SweetWater revenues on the last report as it ended Nov 30, recording $881k of revenues in the 6 days the company was on the books. Based on the above we can expect new revenues north of $10M added to the top line from the SweetWater acquisition. That $10M+ in new revenue plus their growing Cannabis Sales should be more than enough to cover Stifel's expectations. 

I’ll leave the speculation on what Stifel is trying to do up to you guys, but I do thank them for the better entry. I should also point out that Aphria/Tilray merger vote is on April 14, 2 days after earnings.

I like the stock."

2021-04-07 14:49:14,wallstreetbets,"My APHA story:

Time in the market will always be better than timing it. I held onto APHA through the short report, bad press, not so great financials for years and pressure to sell. At the time I bought at the peak in 2017. 

Saw my shares go down to $2 and didn’t know what to do with myself. Family pressure and friends pressuring to sell. Saying that saving is the way and that I was being irresponsible. So I doubled down on every drop I could. 

By November my average share price was now 6.45 instead of 17 or 18 (can’t remember exactly). Elections roll around (exactly why I was BUYING MORE) and then we saw the results. 3 long years of me constantly looking at losses and feeling like complete shit because I had told people about my investments and of course people will always remind you of your mistakes every time they can (don’t do what I did be quiet). 

February rolls around and those same friends didn’t even ask. They knew. They knew I was right then and they know I am right today. There is no better feeling in the world and your day will come young grasshopper. You need to buy more. That’s it. Is it shares? Not options? Buy more. Is this industry going anywhere else but up? No. I’m still holding those shares and didn’t sell at the “top” because that was t the top period. 

I am holding indefinitely because that’s how you build wealth. Not by hoping In and out of trades because somewhere along the way you’re gonna probably make a mistake. Few day traders are able to come up with (at peak) +300% return. The likelihood of you being able to do that? Not so likely. 

Hold your shares. Buy more. Period.

APHA April 16th 27C, April 23 19C and Jan 22 22C to the fucking moon!!! 🚀🚀🚀"

2021-04-06 22:24:43,wallstreetbets,What happens if the merger happens before the Jan 22 call?
2021-04-07 07:21:08,wallstreetbets,APHA 27c for next week?! Ruh roh
2021-04-07 10:01:32,wallstreetbets,Damn Mods on weedstocks banned me just because I linked the DD on their sub. Wtf.
2021-04-06 21:51:19,wallstreetbets,Yeah TLRY is dog shit but the market loves them and APHA is fundamentally sound but the market treats them like dog shit so it's a good combo.
2021-04-06 20:36:52,wallstreetbets,Basically the biggest cannabis stock by revenue on the making. A merger on the horizon between two big companies with a great market cap and exposure in a few countries. Weed is picking up momentum again. Decriminalization and legalization on the talks now more than ever.
2021-04-07 00:34:04,wallstreetbets,Anything is possible with the stock market my man. All I know is by sales they will be the worlds largest MJ company. With us legalization in the next few years (hopefully) there’s a lot of room for growth. But idk I’m just a normal guy with a vested interest in aphria. Take my word with a grain of salt! 🥂
2021-04-07 00:39:21,wallstreetbets,"Mergers typically cause a post merger increase in stock price, even if it’s just temporary."
2021-04-07 05:11:50,wallstreetbets,Wrong when mergers are ANNOUNCED declines happen for one of the companies. This happened with aphria when merger announced.
2021-04-07 00:19:12,wallstreetbets,Fuck it i’ll just double down on TLRY and buy APHA
2021-04-06 20:40:23,wallstreetbets,"maybe I'm just smooth brained but wouldn't merger arbitrage in this situation work out in your favor if you were holding APHA? APHA 17.29 currently, TLRY 21.14. If you're receiving 0.87 TLRY for every APHA, that would value every APHA share at 18.39. So at current price APHA is trading at a discount. Obviously this price discrepancy is accounting for possibility of the merger vote failing but looking at 1.10 in intrinsic value   at current price.

EDIT: looked up additional information and found that share conversion is actually 0.8381. Merger arbitrage scenario still exists, just not as lucrative as my previous calculation."

When they were asked about, they said they misjudged the demand for oils and extracts and had way too much of that and not nearly enough flower. If, as you say, everything but current flower production has been processed into extracts, will they be able to sell that stuff? Let’s say they have four years worth of rosin, shatter, oil stored. Can that stuff stay stored for long periods without losing potentcy?"

2021-04-06 22:34:51,wallstreetbets,"To answer your question you get the conversion rate for your options but they become non standard. I do expect APHA to move up higher and into the merger vote and around 4/20. I’ll roll April forward near or on expiration day and hold the Jan as far as I can before they become less liquid. I believe in the company and will hold ALL my 1,235 shares which will convert to Tilray’s. Been in APHA for almost 4 years and it has rewarded me well. This industry is a no brainer for future growth almost anywhere you look."
2021-04-06 22:25:30,wallstreetbets,I plan on rolling those out into Tilray ones after the merger vote goes through and the news hit.

Bedrocan Europe sends 4500 kilo per year to DE.

2021-04-06 21:09:59,wallstreetbets,How's that? There will only be a TLRY after merger and it only has 1 CEO which will be APHA CEO Simon Irwin. So explain how they can conduct seperate business when APHA won't exist and there is only 1 set of books?

Edit: at this point, are you just fucking with me thinking I’m that guy up there? I’m genuinely trying to figure this out."
2021-04-06 20:18:25,wallstreetbets,What's your point? When that happens CURLF will be able to export to Europe the same as Tilray using all of its acreage.
2021-04-06 20:25:10,wallstreetbets,"My point again is that CURLF already holds the top spot in the US, and has positioned itself to take part of Europe when that eventually goes through. Tilray holds the top spot in Canada , a country that has about a tenth of the population of the US and will probably take some of the European market when that goes through. Tilray might enter the US and CURLF might enter Canada but given the hold each have on their territories,  neither will be as successful as the other in the markets they attempt to break into. That leaves me wanting to invest in American Cannabis not Canadian."
2021-04-07 05:24:22,wallstreetbets,"Obviously you didn't read over the material for the merger vote...

Someone once said ""better to be thought a fool and sit silently, than to open ones mouth and remove all doubt"""
2021-04-06 21:47:26,wallstreetbets,"5/21 so you have time to be right. The price will go up and down between now and expiration. More time to expiration means more chances for it to go up and more time to sell when it’s up. I’d go further out for your first call but that’s more expensive. 

Also APHA is merging with TLRY on or around 4/20. The price might spike before that, or after, or it might tank immediately after and then maybe go up. 4/16 means you miss the merger. 4/21 means you’re fucked if the stock tanks immediately after. 5/21 gives you time to profit off whatever happens. 

$17 because there’s pretty strong support at $17. Look at the past 3 months on a chart. Sometimes it dips below $17 but it usually bounces off and back up. It’s a safe strike without going too deep ITM (more expensive).

It’s always better to buy more ITM and further out expirations if you like making money. It gives you more leeway to be right. ITM is an upfront cost that you get back if you sell for a profit. Further out is a sunk cost that increases your probability of making money, but you can still recover some of that cost the sooner you sell."
2021-04-06 20:31:59,wallstreetbets,What you are failing to see the world is not all CAPITALISTIC like the USA in order to get into other countries is not just as simple as it is open we can move in .
2021-04-07 00:14:07,wallstreetbets,"Excellent answer, on point. Great advice! Not investment advice!"
2021-04-06 21:58:18,wallstreetbets,Thank you on the education.
2021-04-06 21:04:25,wallstreetbets,Tried to read that but it grammatically makes no sense. I'm not sure what you are trying to say. If you are saying it will be easy for a foreign company to come into the US market when things loosen up I think you are wrong given the hold companies that already operate here have. If you are saying it will be hard for the US to enter other markets maybe but Tilray is in Canada so they are in the same boat. Or if you are saying something else? Idk that was hard to make sense of my man. Either way good luck investing! Hope you find a winning strategy.

The Bottom Line

""Canadian companies have received highly specialized approval in particular situations to ship cannabis products into the U.S. It's important to recognize that these are limited scenarios and that the situation is far from an open door for Canadian cannabis to flow southward."""
2021-04-07 08:10:06,wallstreetbets,"""to ship cannabis products into the US"" you're in denial m8"
2021-04-07 08:14:48,wallstreetbets,Not to sell. For a clinical trial. You typed it yourself.
2021-04-07 08:19:11,wallstreetbets,"Cannabis is sold in vertically integrated shops in the US. The shops sell their own products. Like Apple only sells Apple products in their stores. In a few cases , shops are privately owned but those are quickly being bought by the big players."
2021-04-07 08:15:52,wallstreetbets,So they just shipped it for free?
2021-04-07 08:24:18,wallstreetbets,"Idk man. You typed that Tilray exported weed to the US for a clinical trial. That's what you typed. For a ""clinical trial"" does not mean they sold what they exported. It means they shipped product here to be used in a clinical trial as in a step that happens in the drug application process. Like Moderna had a clinical trial of it's covid 19 vaccine to determine whether it was safe and effective before it was given EUA by the FDA in the US."
2021-04-07 11:19:26,wallstreetbets,Hope my free research cleared things up for you. Good luck in your investment strategy.

2021-04-06 21:31:09,wallstreetbets,Sent you the message also posted it
2021-04-06 23:32:21,wallstreetbets,What OP did and how he made so much? I'm new to the stock market.
2021-04-07 01:15:37,wallstreetbets,"This will be nice for me as well because I have been trying to find ways I can describe or explain what options are to beginners without using technical terms that kind of make it more confusing than it needs to. 

What OP did was what’s called an option play. 

In a regular stock, you make money by buying a stock at a certain price and waiting some time for that price to rise so you can sell it for a profit. But the problem with this is that you may not have enough money, so if you only put $100 and get a 2% rise, you gain two dollars for a total of $102. 

So in the most layman term, (and this is NOT technical explanation of what OP did but rather helpful comparison). 

You see that +25? Add 2 zeros to that. Now, it looks like OP bought 2,500 shares of GM at $40.6 per share (number at “break even price”). 

Currently GM is trading at 62$. This means he gained 62-40.6= 21.4$ per share. Remember there are 2500 shares, so $21.4 times 2,500 is 53,500 profit. 

So he made around 55k. And he only put in 1,500$ for this because that’s the price he bought (avg cost). 

Again, he did not actually buy shares, he bought what’s called a contract. And you can essentially think of a contract as “buying” 100 shares that get activated when you go past the break even price. This way you can on things like 2500 shares of GM with dust 1,500 dollars when buying the shares would have costed you 100,000$ at 40$ a share. 

(*Again this is not a technical description or even exclamation of what OP did or what an option is. This is just trying to make sense of how he made the money for the beginners who don’t really understand why leveraging works or what leveraging even means*)"

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"MY EXPERIENCE WITH SWEET CREAM BUTTER FUTURES: Hello children gather around the campfire ~

It all started last year in February of 2020 right when the pandemic was really starting to batter the U.S. 

I was playing some 5/5/15 PLO at my buddies game, when my friend who we all just call “milk man” began to open his stupid mouth about how “this and that” is going to send the price of sweet cream butter skyrocketing because of some bullshit about how grocery stores will be understocked and Martha will need a fuck ton of sweet cream butter to feed the family while everyone’s stuck at home. We all call him milk man because he’s literally a cow milker, has a big farm, and always wears this hat with a cow on it. 

I use derogatory language when regarding milk man now, but then, his stack was tall and mine was short. I was tilted and also drunk when something in me clicked and said “this is it. butter futures is the yolo that will make me rich.” I was working a great job in finance at the time and had some capital to work with.

I listened to milk man go on and on about butter for the rest of the night. The next morning, Monday. I yolo’d into CME cash-settled butter futures expiring March 15th, 2020. Naive me at the time thought COVID would be over with within a couple of months.

Then it all went to fucking shit. 

So supposedly I didn’t yolo into sweet cream butter futures but I just flat out yolod into butter futures. I honestly didn’t even know what the fuck I was doing but I just figured all butter was going up crazy so it didn’t matter. Well I was dead wrong. 

These fucking worthless dairy farmers couldn’t keep up with the demand so they began to either put palm oil into the butter or the fed the cows too much palm oil to the point that it got into the butter. I’m still not sure what they did, but it doesn’t matter. Half of god damn Canada was complaining that their butter is rock solid at room temperature. How the fuck do you expect them to spread it on toast? It was a disaster. Butter tanked. I was ruined. 

Fast forward a year later and looking back it’s all not so bad. I have a really steady job now and the pay is pretty good. The only downside is every time I’m milking cows on milk mans farm he says the same dumb joke every time. 

“Make sure that’s sweet cream milk and not regular milk!”

Fucking dick. Sweet cream futures thrived. Up nearly 20% since February 2020."

Also shorts aren't the only fucking people selling calls. So fuck off with your bullshit"

2021-04-07 00:07:14,wallstreetbets,Is it? All things considered its only 50k shares that are most likely covered
2021-04-07 16:07:41,wallstreetbets,"Those calls were probably sold covered, so his exercising them should have zero effect on the ticker price though, right?  Usually he posts his yolo updates after the market closes so it wouldn't even necessarily deliver a hype/sentiment boost that affects the ticker.  


I think people are hoping for RC announcement as CEO and/or some kind of share recall/split/???? that would force the hedges to begin covering.  Clearly Gamestop and RC think there's room for this thing to grow else they'd do the share sale now."
2021-04-06 21:25:49,wallstreetbets,Complicated question. The calls he holds have extrinsic value that is rapidly decreasing due to theta decay. He can still capitalize on the remaining extrinsic value by selling his options now vs exercising them at expiration.
2021-04-06 22:13:42,wallstreetbets,"Despite some people down voting you're right in that an option position can be ""rolled out"" to another expiration.   There is additional premium for this,  but your question is reasonable."
2021-04-06 22:54:24,wallstreetbets,They most likely bought all the shares to fill the call once it hit 12.01. Those calls would've been covered very long ago
2021-04-07 06:30:49,wallstreetbets,Or they weren’t naked calls?
2021-04-06 20:34:42,wallstreetbets,Yea when I'm having a bad day. I kick myself for not buying those calls myself. I guess I'm a glutton for punishment as they say lol
2021-04-07 11:17:56,wallstreetbets,"I said i READ that options delay the squeeze, the short squeeze. Options does nothing to help with the squeeze, buying and holding shares does though.

2021-04-07 17:50:11,wallstreetbets,Options have been the cause of the GMEs peaks is what I'm telling you. Options right now are risky because of the high iv but it's his money.

2021-04-07 12:02:33,wallstreetbets,"This is a good and important point. Thanks. DFVs decision really depends on whether he thinks the share price will go up or down. Also, the optics of his choice will weigh heavily on the share price."
2021-04-07 16:11:38,wallstreetbets,What if someone poor like me had 500 contracts this far ITM but couldn't afford to exercise.  Would my best bet be to sell the contracts or get some kind of line of credit that would allow me to exercise them myself?

2021-04-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Building off the post from yesterday, I built a dashboard that tracks congressmen’s returns from stock trading over time. You can use it to see who’s a fellow member of WSB and who’s actually making money. [Here’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/investmentdata/comments/kj69oo/track_trading_by_us_senators/) the dashboard tracking trading by U.S. Senators.

[Senate Stock trading vs. S&P 500](https://preview.redd.it/4tqxbg3gxkr61.png?width=1960&format=png&auto=webp&s=da597db3d306e5abf848080cec1726e6bce09730)

A while back I did a little write-up on which politicians I actually think browse this sub, I’ll copy that below:

**Honorable Mention: Former Rep. Barbara Comstock (VA-10)**

Comstock lost her 2018 re-election bid and I don't necessarily think she is a WSBer (she doesn't trade nearly as many meme stocks as the other guys on this list) but I do blame her for turning off the ATM that was 2016-2018 $MU.

She bought \~$75,000 worth of Micron Technology stock on 6/25/18, just days before the first stretch in years when the stock wasn't literally printing money. MU lost half its value in the next 6 months, and still hasn't recovered to the price she purchased it at.

**#5. Rep. Alan Lowenthal (CA-47)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SPCE, GLD***

Lowenthal is actually one of the more successful traders on this list, having gotten in to $GLD in September of 2019. He also timed his exit from $SPCE pretty well, selling about half of his position right at the mid-February peak.

If I had to guess, I'd say Lowenthal just lurks the sub looking for opportunities to inverse WSB.

**#4. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SNAP, TSLA, GE, NVDA, LULU, AMD***

The Josh Gottheimer story is a story of perseverance and diamond hands. I'm pretty sure this guy read some DD on here that said SNAP was going to moon after its IPO, because he bought into the stock just days after it went public. He caught the falling knife right on its tip as his position lost 75% of its value over the next couple years. A lesser man would have cut the loss, but Gottheimer just kept buying up more $SNAP even as it was losing him money. Those of you who have an eye on the markets (perhaps a minority) will know that his grit and determination was rewarded handsomely in the last couple months.

**#3. Sen. Pat Roberts (Kansas)**

***Favorite meme stocks: TSLA, GLD, BYND, NVDA, GE***

Pat Roberts is another guy that I think just comes here to inverse the sub. Roberts made an impeccably well-timed TSLA play a few months ago when he bought in on August 3rd, just a few days before the August run-up began and then sold on September 1st, just before the early September drop.

Insider trading or inversing WSB? You decide.

WSB must be big in Kansas, because the next guy up is the fellow who was just elected to fill the vacancy being left by Roberts upcoming departure from the senate.

**#2. Rep. Roger Marshall (KS-1)**

***Favorite meme stocks: JNUG, TSLA, SNAP, MU, ROKU, AMD, NVDA, LULU***

Marshall got a big promotion to the Senate a few days ago, and if that didn't work out he probably would have switched to day-trading full time. He was already day-trading JNUG within a few months of entering office, buying and then selling thousands of dollars worth of the stock between market open and close.

What Marshall really lacks is patience, as he recently entered then prematurely exited a position in ROKU in mid-September, missing out on big gains in the weeks to follow.

**#1 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (Rhode Island)**

***Favorite meme stocks: GME, TSLA, GE, NVDA***

The story of Sheldon Whitehouse is not a happy story, but it's a story that might be told of many a member of this community. He had the right ideas, but just did not have strong enough hands to see them through.

On July 28, 2017, Whitehouse entered a position in $TSLA. Seeing a modest 3% gain through the month of August, he doubled down on his position on August 24th, 2017.

Although he soon began to lose money as $TSLA sank, in Elon he still trusted, and he bought more $TSLA yet again in December of 2018.

Sadly for Whitehouse, we now reach the heartbreaking part of the story. Seeing a 30% loss on the investments into TSLA he'd been making over the last 2 years, Whitehouse lost faith and sold the entirety of the position on August 27th, 2019.

After holding TSLA for over 2 years at a loss, he sold within weeks of what would become a yearlong, nearly 1000% run-up."

2021-04-06 21:43:19,wallstreetbets,"Tl;dr: Used their product, waste of time and money for any remotely complex issue.  

They have great marketing and have developed locations in hipster shared workspaces, with cute and friendly techs, but the technical expertise and organization on the back end is not there.  

1. No continuity of care. Every time to talk to them, it's a new person you have to explain your issue to. Every time.  

2. Bottom of the barrel orthodontists.  Self explanatory, only people working here can't maintain their own practice; Or overseas ones, either way, no shifts given.  Considering how terrible in person orthodontists are already, imagine how bad they are.  

3. Lies/incompetence.  Basically kept saying they could fix my problem. 3 rounds and no solution.  End up with teeth messed up in a different way than at the start.  Waste of years that could have been used to actually fix my teeth.  

Positives

No upcharge for extra rounds (I paid upfront though) even after repeated failures.  More likely didn't track previous cycles.

Everyone was kind and honestly wanted to help; only reason i stuck around.  

90% refund, probably could have gotten 95+% based on how fast they agreed, as it's cheap price to not get sued for messing up.  

Overall, they are only good the simplest of issues and the cost savings is from being shit outta luck if it doesn't work.  With the constantly dropping costs of the 3D printing, they are quickly losing their competitive advantage, as you can see by their rapidly rising prices.  
Still have a market, with most non-urban areas, but they have been hit the hardest by covid."

2021-04-07 12:15:11,wallstreetbets,"Ammunition, mostly. One of the drivers for the Bull case for ASO is ammunition sales, since ammo prices have skyrocketed, but ammo is only one small part of Academy’s business—Vista, on the other hand, gets 68% of its revenue from ammunition, and recently acquired a new factory from Remington. On top of that, ammo is usually very low margin—the increased price of ammo represents even more of a profit increase than it looks like at first blush for a manufacturer, and the rise of e-commerce through COVID plays a role in reducing their marginal cost, since they’re an ammo producer.

As far as their high P/E ratio goes, they were actually trading even higher when the stock went public in 2015, again likely due to a similar ammo shortage at the time. The fact that this was the year the stock went public frustrates analysis, but I think it’ll go even higher than back then—Vista has been paying off debt for the last five years and the ammo shortage is even more extreme than it was in 2015 due to many people buying their first gun in 2020. Plus, they’re not just keeping production static—they’re ramping up, and Biden is nothing if not a status quo warrior who will keep the ammo hoarders riled up while making no effectual change in gun laws."
2021-04-06 21:17:27,wallstreetbets,You can still get IV crushed and lose both ways.
2021-04-07 14:40:03,wallstreetbets,"Also, re: their debt, have you read through their Q4 report?

First off, they didn't pay off 50% of their debt-- not even remotely close.  Out of their $4b in liabilities they paid off 660m.  Basically none of it was paying down debt-- most of it was just them paying off suppliers who had floated them goods for the upcoming holiday season.  And almost all of that came straight out of their cash reserves.  They had 870m cash in hand now they've got 150m.

Second, have you read the 2020 term loan facility?  It's not a full on variable rate loan like the 2015 facility was, but it's very close-- they have the choice of paying either LIBOR+5 (with a minimum of 0.75 for the LIBOR) OR the *highest* of 1) Fed Funds Rate + 0.5, Credit Suisse's ""prime rate,"" or the one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus a margin of 4%.  So they're only guaranteed a fixed minimum rate if LIBOR stays under 0.75.

Third-- and this is the real kick in the pants-- they're reducing their hedge against a rise in the interest rate.  Per their Q4 report:

> We use interest rate swap agreements to hedge market risk relating to possible adverse changes in interest rates.
All interest rate swaps had been designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate interest payments on borrowings under the 2015 Term Loan Facility. On October 28, 2020, we determined that a portion of the underlying cash flows related to $100.0 million of swap notional principal amount was no longer probable of occurring over the remaining term of the interest rate swaps as a result of the Company's planned refinancing transactions (see Note 15). As a result, we reclassified approximately $1.3 million of losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss (""AOCI"") to other (income) expense, net in our statements of income for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2020 related to the portion of the forecasted transaction no longer considered probable of occurring. We also de-designated a portion of our interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges, leaving $250 million notional principal amount designated and $650 million undesignated. The remaining $4.0 million loss in AOCI as of October 31, 2020 related to the de-designated hedges will be amortized as an increase to interest expense over the original maturity of the de-designated swaps. The de-designated $650 million notional principal amount of fixed interest rate swaps will receive mark-to-market treatment prospectively, with changes in fair value recorded immediately to other (income) expense, net on the statements of income.

You see what they're saying?  ""We had a hedge against rate increases with a notional value of $1b, but we decided we didn't need it any more.  We're keeping $250m of that as a hedge, but we've freed up the other $750m, and this quarter we sold $100m of that $750m.  Any money we make or lose with these undesignated swaps we're going to call income.""

But the 2020 loan facility offers an alternative fixed minimum rate only if LIBOR stays below 0.75.  If it goes above 0.75 then the rates become just as variable as the 2015 loan facility.  It's like if they had 100 lifeboats on their ship and they've just sold 10 of them and put another 65 up for sale.  But as soon as LIBOR goes above 0.75, the seas will become just as choppy as when they had 100 lifeboats.

A LIBOR over 0.75 isn't a crazy thought, you roll the clock back just 1 year and LIBOR was over 0.75.  This is a risky strategy for a company that's reporting $4.3b of assets against $3.3b of liabilities, especially when $862m of their assets is goodwill and another $1.72b is other intangibles.

EDIT:  Fixed some grammar."

Not to mention half of that debt is from the new senior secured notes which bear interest at a fixed rate and the other half is the term loan. That’s why they only kept $250M of the swaps as a hedge. You went on a whole rant about rates and hedging as if they still have over $1 billion in unhedged variable rate debt. That’s not even close to being the case.

And in regards to the interest rate swap accounting, that’s all correct so idk what you’re even trying to say here."

Their liabilities haven't changed, they're in just as much debt as they were last year and the year before that.  The only difference is their accounts payable has gotten all kinds of fucked up.  It's double what it was last year!  The suppliers might not charge you interest, but it's the same thing when they demand a higher price for the goods in exchange for delayed payment, or worse, tell you to fuck off and give priority to your competitors.  When the pandemic ends, those accounts payable numbers are going to return to the historic trendline or you're gonna operate at a higher cost than your competitors or the suppliers will just stop supplying you.  Are you seriously trying to argue that this is normal and healthy and can be sustained?  Their COGS didn't double my dude, don't fucking pretend this is normal shit.

And the new debt structure does not have a lower interest expense, what are you talking about?  They're paying 6% on their fixed stuff (which is higher than the 2015 stuff it's replacing) and the variable rates on their 2020 stuff are higher than their 2015 stuff.

They haven't reduced their liabilities.  They've failed to renew about half of their long-term debt, and on the other half they're paying higher rates.

Seriously, look at the asset/liabilities of Big Five's or Dick's, or Hibbett, or any of these other guys, and then look at ASO's balance sheet.  It's a fucking jump scare looking at this shit."
2021-04-07 19:24:01,wallstreetbets,"To respond to the rest of your comment...

Cash increased $228, AP increased $363 (most of the increase in current liabilities), and COGS increased $556. We can assume that the cash will need to be used to satisfy their current liabilities (likely AP). 

If we do that, total AP drops $563 for FYE 2021 compared to $429 for FYE 2020 and $530 for FYE 2019. 

Using these numbers, we can calculate days payable outstanding. That gives us 46 days for FYE 2021 and 52 days for FYE 2020. So they actually paid their suppliers faster this year than they did last year.

As for interest expense on the new debt structure, it’s lower. Paying 6% on $800 million is cheaper than paying 5% on $1.4 billion."

And inventory and property went down.  Total assets only went up by 53 my dude.

> AP increased $363

And accrued expenses and other liabilities went up 80, and they've got 138 in deferred taxes they need to pay.

> We can assume that the cash will need to be used to satisfy their current liabilities (likely AP).

Ok, so they're gonna take the extra cash, and instead of replenishing their inventory, or paying their taxes, they're gonna pay their suppliers.  A bold strategy Cotton, let's see where we go with this.

> If we do that, total AP drops $563 for FYE 2021 compared to $429 for FYE 2020 and $530 for FYE 2019.

And all you had to do was leave some of your shelves empty and kidnap the guy the IRS sent after you, I'm liking it.

> Using these numbers, we can calculate days payable outstanding. That gives us 46 days for FYE 2021 and 52 days for FYE 2020. So they actually paid their suppliers faster this year than they did last year.

Maybe the suppliers will be so happy they'll help us bury the body of that IRS agent we had to disappear.

2021-04-07 01:55:05,wallstreetbets,"Good question. Yes, DISCB ownership was squeezier because the ownership was like 95% held with one dude. VIACA is not quite that concentrated, but it is still extremely tight. Insiders own about 80%, and very large institutions that want some sway in voting own about 15%, and the rest is floated or short. Arbitrageurs tend to short the shares when they trade ahead of their sister share (VIACA and VIAC), which can make these floats even tighter. So I think the best way to play a rebound trade and potentially get some of that DISCB style action is to play VIACA. I have a feeling it will catch shorts offsides once the selling is done.

I should probably do one more post about this aspect. It seems not as many people as I expected are appreciating this angle of the trade. I wanted to post a bunch of pictures illustrating this point in my original post, but I can't figure out how to do that."

How much of the money will be reinvested in local communities? How many people will share the money with friends and family and help them cover loans?

I would feel bad for anyone who has their retirement put in jeopardy due to the reckless actions of some hedge funds. But maybe instead of bailing out the banks they bail out the poor SOBs that got suckered into thinking these hedge funds know what the fuck they are doing."

2021-04-06 20:44:46,wallstreetbets,"in terms of quality, heres how it compares:

clothing: about the same as Target, but cheaper. not as stylish though.

groceries: about the same as mid-level grocery (cub, kroger, safeway, etc). usually cheaper staples, but meat is hit or miss.

toiletpaper/cleaning supplies/etc: cheapest you can find except costco. quality is brand names, so its fine.

baby disposables (diapers, etc): cheapest name brands around.

baby non-disposables (strollers and such): china crap. do not buy

high end luxury: do not shop at walmart.

overall walmart is great.

edit: also, walmart is the only place you can get Cheetos Mac&Cheese, so its a clear winner."

2021-04-07 15:13:11,wallstreetbets,"I opened them in the first week of March when I saw the massive volume (28k) at the $100 strike price. I’m sure I should have sold sooner. I assume it is stupid to think that since the OI has basically stayed the same the price will come down. The thing is, now that I’m down sooo much, I figure it’s better to hold out than take a 80% loss."

2021-04-06 20:14:45,wallstreetbets,"#WTF is this horse shit?

“ Hey there Prestigious_Count_62, good afternoon, hope all is well on your end. I just wanted to ask if you have the Acorns investing app and if you might be interested in joining a pool I am running to try and reach their 4 referrals for $1000 bonus target by the end of the week.

Acorns is a stock investing app in the US that has recently started a promo where you get $1000 if you can refer 4 people by the end of the week. Its a legit app, if you look it up on the app store its got over 700,000 reviews.

You would only need to keep your account open for like a month and then you could close it. I am splitting the profit between everyone in the pool, so you get a big cut of the $1000 if you are interested :)

Let me know if you might be interested in this and I could send over some more info. I promise that this not a scam, just google this offer and you will see plenty of reputable finance blogs covering the same thing. I also have found its far more profitable to build long-term trust with people and ultimately get them to try many of my referrals, vs just trying to scam them out of a quick buck and burning potential bridges with the few folks actually interested in giving me a chance with one of my offers. I don’t even care if you use my referral codes over someone else's, wont bother me either way. Thanks, and enjoy the rest of your day!”"

Certainly no fund is allowed to do it at this point, and there’s been no evidence it’s happened with GME.

2021-04-07 11:08:47,wallstreetbets,"Forgive me if this is a dumb statement, but SPY 500 is back up to $407ish again today.. and the last month week/month/year trend shows it's going up steadily... even if he gambled away his investment and it went down by several $$'s, couldn't he just hold for a few days (Or a couple weeks) and make the profit anyway?

It doesn't seem like that big a risk to me... Or am I just dumb?

Edit: NVM i did some research, I didn't realize contract call options are literally gambling. ""I bet you the stock price wont cross ""x"" amuont before ""x"" date."" is essentially what it is, to my understanding. I learned something today."
2021-04-06 23:22:09,wallstreetbets,"```
My Strategy Summarized:
1)  I never fight the trend. If its green, i buy calls. If its red, i buy puts. I will only buy puts on a green day if there is a overall change in market trend. Inversely, calls on a red day
2) Price action is my #1 indicator. I wait for it to confirm my thesis before i enter a trade
3) I only trade SPY Options
4) My baseline is to choose a call/put that has a DTE 6-7 days out, with a strike $2-$3 away. I adjust that to fit my current appetite for volatility. i virtually never play same day DTE's. 
5) I set a 10% stop, but usually exit at 8% before my stop triggers depending on current situation
6) I utilize about 10-20% of my Portfolio for one trade. Sometimes more. Rarely less. 
7) I never hold overnight in these market conditions.
8) I shoot for 10-20% for gains. Depending on market conditions.
9) The main indicators i use are the:
       a) RSI
       b) 8ema
       c) 50 sma
       d) 200 sma
       e) macd
10) I never force a trade. No trade is a good trade too if the entry just isn't there. 
11) Patience always pays off. A great set-up can form in minutes or seconds. I never regret being patient to enter. I nearly always regret rushing into a trade.

There’s ways around it. You know how much a conventional motor adds to the vehicle 🤦🏻‍♂️ and how cars are literally engineered around it. Same thing will go with the hub-motors. Actually, the weight distribution will be better in Hub-Motors because all four wheels will have equal weights on them. Your center of gravity will be truly center to the vehicle.

I like how you also have no idea what unsprung weight means and then mention something completely tangential about weight distribution. There are already cars with equal weight distribution."

2021-04-07 00:17:09,wallstreetbets,"EV's are a totally screwed up market right now. They have their uses like golf carts. They have serious battery problems. We know Lithium Ion is not the future. It's an environmental nightmare that makes gas look clean. Charge times suck for any type of cross country use. Whatever infrastructure for charging that is created will be obsolete as soon as a new environmentally sound battery solution is found. 

In my opinion because I don't give investment advice. Whatever the next gen of battery is will be the investment that goes to Andromeda. These EV vehicle companies will be swallowed and may make you a few bucks but they aren't the thing that moons. The thing that powers them that can charge in a minute will be the thing that moons.

2021-04-07 15:19:08,wallstreetbets,i guess i dont know a lot about cars but i think this might depend on your definition of an engine. to me engine is somewhat interchangable with motor as something that converts power to physical energy. If you say it doesnt have a traditional engine them i agree but i just wasnt sure what you were reffering to
2021-04-07 15:29:12,wallstreetbets,"I may be nitpicking but the entire concept is so completely different that it's really not such a stretch to say they should not be interchangeable. The cars we have driven for decades are covered in motors...some the size of a tic tac box, some bigger, some smaller. Nobody in the industry will use the terms interchangeably. Look at Tesla's own site, look at Lucid, all of them.

Everything opening back up, and vaccinations picking up speed. They’re open to the general public in many areas, having reached peak penetration in essential workers, elderly, and other Tier 1s.
Large public gatherings of all kinds increasing. 
Hospitals ending their restrictions on elective surgeries, with cases reaching new highs in March. 
Roads are getting busier each week.

I'm not getting my information exclusively from him. He seems to be more of a PR scientific spokesman than other things

Regardless, you cite CNBC as a source....lol. And who said the vaccines WAS permanent? Flu vaccines aren't lifelong. You clearly know absolutely nothing about biology, epidemiology, or anything science related. Guarantee your highest education is high school; or, if you got a degree its in like business. My point is you know so, so much less than you think you do. You've been mesmerized and bedazzled by media. Have you ever, legitimately, read an actual scientific study? Have you ever critically analyzed the methods of a study (sample size, controls, etc), made judgements about the conclusion the author draws? I highly, highly doubt you have in any intellectual setting. I have never even made many assertions here, I am generally unsure. I stay skeptical. But a lot of people a lot smarter than me did a lot of work to get where we are. Pretending I can critique that is arrogant. 

I'll leave you with this Bertrand Russell quote that is the epitome of you. ""The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts.""

Your idiocy is projecting here bud, just stop. Someone with no actual education in the subject, why should we listen to you? 

You also never answered the question, have you ever, ever looked at a scientific study and analyzed it? I really doubt it. 

Here you are, high school education, no experience analyzing or critiquing studies, stating things with 100% confidence in a complex scientific realm. Lol.... gotta love confident reddit idiots"

2021-04-07 14:02:39,wallstreetbets,"No, the public is crazy for thinking this will somehow end and go back to normal. Two weeks to flatten the curve and here we are a year later. You can call me crazy, but it doesn’t change the fact of this virus having a 99.9% survival rate for those under 40 and thus no need to get the shot. Right now, there’s small evidence saying the shot prevents infecting others. But there’s also evidence to contrary through viral shedding. So just get your shot and wear your mask and listen to your lies. But I’m good, I’m not going to do any of that."
2021-04-07 15:44:25,wallstreetbets,"Bruh you keep changing the subject, making assumptions about what I agree with or not.  

You bring up vaccine trials, then move to length of immunity, then move to masks, then to Fauci, then to curve flattening, then to survival rate.

I disagree vehemently with many decisions we as a country made. But your all over the place man, each thing you brought up is so very different than the next; and each thing requires extensive analysis to see if that was effective, if it was prudent at the time, etc. At least be specific with your grievances or just shut the fuck up."
2021-04-07 16:35:08,wallstreetbets,You don’t think those subjects are interrelated? Are you trolling or what?
2021-04-07 18:19:17,wallstreetbets,"Yea but each one needs an in-depth analysis. I never said I agree with all covid measures taken, everything about masks, everything fauci said, the vaccine etc. yea they’re related but each a very expansive topic. Let’s just both go our separate ways. 

Your confidence in your information just absolutely shocked me. “Idiots so sure of themselves...” and this all started with me broadly saying on PRINCIPLE, vaccines protect the populace. Then you went off."

2021-04-07 00:05:58,wallstreetbets,"That’s not olive oil, unfortunately. Most of the Italian olive oils are fake or adulterated. 

Also it’s kind of not fair to try to compare membership grocery store prices. Those prices are subsidized by your membership fees, and especially by the membership fees of the people who pay the fee but rarely shop there. 

The (more expensive) organic Kirkland olive oil is (more likely to be) real olive oil. It’s what I buy and it’s the last deal still out there in olive oil. Most people aren’t buying it. Most people don’t know any better and are buying canola oil in an olive oil bottle. 

The California sourced (not the foreign sourced) bottles from California Olive Ranch are real olive oil. They used to be $20 for a half gallon. Now they are $10 for 16oz."

2021-04-07 15:17:34,wallstreetbets,"If you have read about family that basically runs VIAC (it's like some medieval high court drama with those fucks) they been reported saying that to complete with major streamers (Netflix and others) all smaller media companies have to consolidate into one mega corp to have bargaining power for sports streaming and media portfolio that can compete with major streamers. They been saying this for a while actually and the first step was to merge Viacom with CBS. That came to be (with some corporate drama) and now rumour is that when this merger is digested ViacomCBS will merge with Discovery (and it's quite legit rumour confirmed from multi sources). Also, there are other rumours (less confirmed) that ViacomCBS might buy out or merge with Lionsgate and/or MGM. They been eyeing Sony studios but Sony is unlikely to sell. Anyway, if all goes to plan in few years time we could have mega streaming corp that owns most of the ""legacy"" TV shows and films. At current valuation of 11x p/e (priced for nuclear war) I'm willing to take long bet and wait this out for few years. I think there could be some very nice appreciation."

2021-04-07 15:59:52,wallstreetbets,"It's nice to read comments from someone who is not brain dead retard like 99% of population here. All your points are valid but I think there's more with VIAC than meets the eye. I won't go into much detail here but Redstone family (people who own VIAC) are not stupid. They realise that their business is toast if they don't do something about it. Their plan is to consolidate all the old media companies as soon as possible to gain scale and build up big media portfolio. They recently merged Viacom and CBS and it looks like they are planning to merge with Discovery at some point later. There are also rumours of them eyeing Lionsgate and MGM. Plus they been buying smaller media companies as of late. If all goes to plant in few years time we could have mega corp who owns most of the old TV media, films and has long license to air sports. That's good on its own but what's even better is that VIAC does not care that much about having the best streaming platform but about having the best media portfolio. When Disney launched their streaming platform they pulled their IP from Netflix because they want exclusivity. When VIAC launched their streaming platform they still licensed their IP to Amazon and Netflix and they have stated that they will continue to do so. In my view that quite unique approach and actually very good approach. Let Amazon build infra and app and just license your massive portfolio to them. While also streaming stuff yourself. Everybody wins. Now those mergers could not work out, things could go bad and all that. True. But with current valuation going long on shares. I think odds are in my favour."

:)"
2021-04-07 16:54:17,wallstreetbets,"I dont agree at all with the strategy you're outlining here.

1)  The content makers take all the risk in the model you're proposing.  One season they've got the best shows and they're on top.  The next season someone else has the best shows and they're fucked.  When you control the distribution channel, you have a cushion against those sort of ups and downs, but when you don't, it is rough.  In the ecosystem you're outlining, the Netflix's make money no matter what-- the people licensing to them are living feast or famine.

2)  Amazon and Netflix are not pure-play streaming platforms any more.  They make their own content now.  So every time you do dealings with them, they're gonna have their finger on the scale-- they're gonna promote their own stuff over yours, give you the short end of the algorithm whenever they want.  Your content creators will always be playing handicapped against their content creators-- and if that's the state of affairs, how hard will it be for the shops with streaming platforms to poach your creatives (or sports licenses) from you?

3)  Mergers with other similarly positioned players don't magically modernize your company, it's just a doubling down on the model that's losing.  Owning the back catalogue of The Dick Van Dyke show AND I Love Lucy is not going to magically solve anything.

4)  They don't have the cash to fund significant acquisitions.  Which means they'll have to offer stock instead.  Why would I want to invest in a stock that has ""DILUTION SOON"" in big red letters over it?

5)  Even if the leadership of Viacom is convinced that the solution to their weak streaming platform is to merge with everyone else that has a shitty streaming platform, who's to say their M&A targets agree?  Again, there's no synergy.  You're a $30b left shoe trying to convince another $30b left shoe to form a giant $60b left shoe.  Meanwhile a $300b right shoe could be on the other line with your M&A target, making a better offer.  How are you going to outbid them if they decide they want what you're after?  And if they don't want what you're trying to eat, doesn't that say something about the quality of your meal?

6)  Mergers make you bigger, which makes you harder to be acquired by someone else, and being acquired by someone else is, in my view, one of the best things that could happen to a VIAC shareholder in a world in which they cant get their own foothold in the streaming world.

-----

I agree on at least one point, which is that Viacom is cheap.  They're one of the cheapest ways to buy a dollar of earnings on the market today.  And on that basis alone I'd rate it neutral.  But I would sell it in an instant if they merged with a company that did not have a successful streaming platform.

And if Viacom is going to aggressively push mergers, I would rather own the stock of the companies they're going to be making the lucrative offers to.  Why buy VIAC if they're going to offer Discovery a sweetheart deal?  Just buy Discovery instead."

2021-04-07 17:25:57,wallstreetbets,"who knows, usually it has very very little activity AH. Monthly options don't expire until next friday so there is a lot of time for those large volume of calls to do something."
2021-04-07 16:44:52,wallstreetbets,"Low volume, it means nothing"

2021-04-07 18:15:56,wallstreetbets,It's gonna go under 28
2021-04-07 14:52:05,wallstreetbets,Cross post to /r/law /r/asklegal you've already done 90% of the research and someone with relative experience in the field should be able to answer.
2021-04-07 12:37:29,wallstreetbets,Plug puts printing
2021-04-06 20:59:14,wallstreetbets,It’s coming back up! Woooo
2021-04-07 08:39:59,wallstreetbets,"I like your strategy, it's retarded enough that it might approximate the average market participant, and as such, net way more than us apes here"
2021-04-07 15:47:59,wallstreetbets,What did you end up doing?
2021-04-07 15:53:48,wallstreetbets,Sold at a 60K loss. The options lost so much value 😭
2021-04-07 05:51:16,wallstreetbets,try 20k-3M-100k-50k during the GME craze bro.
2021-04-07 05:47:43,wallstreetbets,Even worse is that your calls die when TiLT goes up.
2021-04-07 05:49:31,wallstreetbets,I hear if you buy on Tuesday you can actually get 3DTE.
2021-04-07 07:00:27,wallstreetbets,"I believe it 100% because I wasn’t far off from that lol not into the millions, but percentages wise yes"
2021-04-07 09:57:15,wallstreetbets,"Not exactly - rough math, looks like Ark is only holding 4-5% of their shares.."
2021-04-07 16:43:32,wallstreetbets,Premiums are trash currently
2021-04-07 08:28:20,wallstreetbets,anyone?
2021-04-06 20:25:57,wallstreetbets,This is effectively an Anti-YOLO.
2021-04-06 22:28:45,wallstreetbets,Lmfao
2021-04-07 12:35:32,wallstreetbets,I love your drive ! We have lots of days before April 16.
2021-04-07 17:06:34,wallstreetbets,"The market has a funny way of humbling us. If you haven't sold this yet, you haven't been humbled."
2021-04-07 14:40:42,wallstreetbets,FYI I rolled almost all of these (and additional capital) to July $800s. Things are getting tight in terms of time...
2021-04-07 19:48:16,wallstreetbets,Love the post nice work breaking it down $CVS.  Im already with you being in on CVS
2021-04-07 07:46:19,wallstreetbets,"Bro I’ve gotten my ass cheeks clapped over this play. I’ve lost 70% of my portfolio so far on July 20$ calls, and July 17.5$ calls. Jesus lord"
2021-04-07 10:43:49,wallstreetbets,So much wow!
2021-04-07 18:55:29,wallstreetbets,"lol snowing coming to the rescue :)

Now he is down a cool 125k since this post 

The point of my post was to save others from fomo and it worked, I had 1 person ping me thanking me saving them a ton of cash.  That is more important to me to help others than see someone crash and burn due to fomo. 

I’m glad you had time to check out my post history, makes me feel special, I need fans like you!"
2021-04-06 22:56:44,wallstreetbets,"I don’t understand the hate. I had my biggest lost ever with UWMC but it was my own fault. Solid DD with helpful information, so thank you for that. I still have a UWMC leap and August calls so I’m hoping for the best. Good luck to you too!"
2021-04-06 20:33:50,wallstreetbets,"I've been wheeling RKT for a few months now. It's been paying decent, IV is pretty juicy."
2021-04-07 17:19:45,wallstreetbets,When in April is this rumored demo supposed to happen?
2021-04-06 22:11:17,wallstreetbets,Where can I listen to the earnings call?
2021-04-07 17:00:10,wallstreetbets,I wanna see your gains!
2021-04-07 17:06:35,wallstreetbets,This was a hell of a good call. I bought the 280's.
2021-04-07 06:40:39,wallstreetbets,They are massively hiring software engineering talent for their Denver office. Positions appear to have heavy focus on consumer side for scaling CTV revenue. The September 35c look like a great gamble right now.
2021-04-07 11:54:47,wallstreetbets,"It's a genuine question. I wasn't here before GME, but from what I've seen that seemed to be the case. I am retarded though, no point trying to hide that 🤷‍♂️"
2021-04-07 12:50:48,wallstreetbets,I am also retarded. Retard is an anagram for trader and has been around forever. Autist has also been around forever and is kind of a term of endearment and I believe started as a reference to Michael Burry who is actually autistic. He was played by Christian bale in the big short.
2021-04-07 12:51:19,wallstreetbets,Ape did start with GME though.
2021-04-07 12:52:50,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
2021-04-07 15:51:43,wallstreetbets,"LMFAO I was just reading all the comments here IT WON'T GO ANY HIGHER lmfaoooooo. Held my 240C and sold today, then bought puts. Ride it both ways. Congrats on the fat gains you have if you didn't sell yet."
2021-04-07 19:08:13,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, they were a bunch of paper handed pussies. I sold today for 4K more than what I would have got if I had sold when everyone was telling me to. Bought TSM calls for my next play."
2021-04-07 06:21:40,wallstreetbets,Brought on by hedgies and shorts. NOK is about to rise up!
2021-04-07 00:18:23,wallstreetbets,Are y’all checking out MSO’s. Already established here. Worst outcome is the Canadian LP’s buy them out. I like Columbia Care and Cresco
2021-04-07 00:22:08,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I was thinking about making a post about MSO's too, although this aphria play is more about the merger than federal legalization right now."
2021-04-07 00:33:15,wallstreetbets,Ya true. I just really like MSO’s. In a lot of legal states the demand is still higher than the supply. Illinois is almost on pace to double the number of sales from 2020. Canadian companies definitely have room to grow but nowhere near American ones
2021-04-06 20:48:10,wallstreetbets,I was driving from Cali to Nevada. Damn today was a nice dip for some MT and CLF long calls. Looks like the bull cycle is just getting warmed up! 😎
2021-04-07 04:26:59,wallstreetbets,Anything yet?
2021-04-07 08:26:40,wallstreetbets,Touché
2021-04-07 14:07:58,wallstreetbets,"Since we continue to average down on our stocks, does the IRS look at first in last out? For example if you bought at $300 a share and you manage the average down to $100 by buying a ton of stock when the price went down to say $40. Are the two blocks separate? Meaning even if you break even When does stock reaches the average downed price, wouldn't it mean that you sold at a loss from the $300 a share block and sold at a larger profit from the $40 a share block? And you would still have to pay taxes on that $40 a share block increase to whatever the break-even point share price is."
2021-04-06 21:38:20,wallstreetbets,woohoo
2021-04-07 11:13:48,wallstreetbets,"Love this play on both PSXP and ET.

Looking at past activity back in July 2020 (the last time the announced a DAPL shutdown), PSXP dropped 6$ and ET dropped 1$.

I like PSXP 27.5p and ET 7.5p & 7p for April 16 date. Both are nice and cheap, low IV.

Too good to pass up! LFG!"
