2021-04-18 18:26:07,wallstreetbets,It was almost all....Too Simple.
2021-04-18 18:20:10,wallstreetbets,Thank god you were here to crack the case. You’ve single handedly uncovered a conspiracy to create a public company and rob investors blind. Good job.
2021-04-18 19:30:44,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I'm not looking forward to a future where human drivers have skill fade and can't cope in an emergency because of lack of practice driving.  My back up camera gets mud on it frequently enough that I'm skeptical about all these sensors working consistently well to reduce the average accident rate."
2021-04-18 19:29:20,wallstreetbets,So Cathie Wood and Co. made a mistake purchasing all those shares.
2021-04-18 18:24:29,wallstreetbets,Im waiting on [Plus.Ai](https://Plus.Ai) to announce its Spac Merger.  They seem to be pretty legit.
2021-04-18 18:34:02,wallstreetbets,"I disagree. I'm a truck driver and have been following them for a long time. AF is the future and they're the best bet. Here's a [Reuters Article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-tusimple-investment-idUSKCN1V51EU) from back in 2019. Amazon, UPS, Budweiser, US Express and others are invested. They've been testing their trucks on their routes."
2021-04-18 18:49:13,wallstreetbets,Tusimple is legit. They have contracts to retrofit other trucks for other companies. You think these big truck companies wouldn’t do DD on weather this company is legit?
2021-04-18 18:52:25,wallstreetbets,"Their ""partners"" haven't been testing their trucks, their only current customers have outsourced freight routes to them, nobody is using their trucks.

Amazon, UPS, etc. have all ""pre-ordered"" trucks... for a $500 deposit.

TuSimple hasn't even made a single truck."
2021-04-18 19:22:04,wallstreetbets,"Might be the future, but OP is calling this company out quite accurately."
2021-04-18 19:11:26,wallstreetbets,"There's a dozen other self driving truck companies. Ike (acquired by Softbank's Nuro), Embark, Plus.ai , etc. This isn't a solved problem, clearly shown with Tusimple burning 128m w/ 1.8 in total revenues. They're no where worth 8b."
2021-04-18 18:59:00,wallstreetbets,Tell the goev people
2021-04-18 19:07:16,wallstreetbets,"The ""contracts"" are $500 pre-orders for 2024, they haven't built a single truck."
2021-04-18 19:24:02,wallstreetbets,DD doesn’t solve the immediate tech limitations OP accurately described. Unless they have better tech than space aliens they can’t do 1000 meter anything.....
2021-04-18 19:13:48,wallstreetbets,"Hi OP, just poke one of us if you get caught again"
2021-04-18 19:42:27,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the effort into this, and I have just one main question without getting too too far into the weeds:

Ok, SPY is up 48% YTD.  So if I had $100k a year ago and leveraged 2:1, I could’ve bought $200k of SPY.  At a 48% return, I would’ve made $96,000, or a 96% annual return on my initial $100k.  Compared to your 108% annualized return, this isn’t too far off.

My question - how is your strategy that much different from “leverage at 2:1 into some good index funds”?

I am just a retard asking retarded questions, so I may have totally missed something, but please help me understand the best you can 🙏"
2021-04-18 19:57:09,wallstreetbets,"Well written. Based on your logic, smart beta seems to be your guiding factor. What is your reasoning behind this?"
2021-04-18 19:37:09,wallstreetbets,isnt pin risk still an issue with any box trading?
2021-04-18 19:14:04,wallstreetbets,!wsbgold
2021-04-18 19:49:09,wallstreetbets,"SPY is not up 48% YTD, I think you just meant 1 year return? It’s not that different in theory, you’re right. I’m just much more optimistic about a global portfolio of smart beta over just SPY. VFMF for in strange is up 65% for the past year, so a substantial part of my returns have been from the ETFs themselves, not just the leverage. That’s why SPY is up 35% over the period I show above, while I’m up 90% (much more than just twice). Not a dumb question at all!"
2021-04-18 19:59:47,wallstreetbets,"Value quality and momentum show up in basically every asset class, in every country, for as long as we have data (very pervasive and statistically significant). I fully agree with the intuition behind what they should continue and the diversification benefits. So it’s a big part of my approach"
2021-04-18 19:39:01,wallstreetbets,I don’t think that’s an issue at all with European options like SPX right? They just get cash-settled based on their strike price and the underlying index value at the moment they expire.
2021-04-18 19:15:05,wallstreetbets,Ur da man zjz!
2021-04-18 19:41:19,wallstreetbets,"haha, i guess not. was wondering why anyone would want those other than favorable tax treatment now i have a valid use case. :)"
2021-04-18 19:42:35,wallstreetbets,Yep!
2021-04-18 18:10:06,wallstreetbets,"I’m going to wait till it hits $100 and THEN panic buy, my wife’s boyfriend wouldn’t have it any other way."

2021-04-18 18:37:44,wallstreetbets,"Fuck it, i’ll buy 10 shares at open and see where it goes"
2021-04-18 17:51:38,wallstreetbets,"Ok the data adds up.
I'm still riding out the gme/amc train. If this still in the 7-10$ ratio by end of next week I'm in since I'm waiting for my paycheck rn"
2021-04-18 16:48:28,wallstreetbets,Buy a little $CLOV just in case it turns into a mini-$GME. Nothing to lose
2021-04-18 18:18:09,wallstreetbets,$CLOV to $50
2021-04-18 18:19:23,wallstreetbets,Fuck it. Threw a few hundred into it. Lesgooo
2021-04-18 18:04:48,wallstreetbets,Had some money in my WeBull account so I’m in for 5 shares. Baby💎👐 here we go!
2021-04-18 17:53:15,wallstreetbets,"$CLOV is easily going north of $10 and back to $12-15 territory without the short factor, the short factor just makes it another possible AMC where it can go triple what it is today, this whole short interest just put it on the map as the possible next meme stock

&#x200B;

I do have position in CLOV but I got in after it crashed on Friday from the corrected numbers"
2021-04-18 16:41:40,wallstreetbets,Got 10 shares at 7.5 on Friday as a fluke before the media and WSB hopped on. I’ll hold for a bit see what happens. Was already up 30% in one day which was interesting to watch.
2021-04-18 17:55:57,wallstreetbets,I made some cash off it Friday right before the market closed and again in the after-hours. If people like it and are willing to spend their hard-earned cash on it then so be it. I'm buying more on Monday.
2021-04-18 16:59:01,wallstreetbets,Go half shares and have 5/21 calls. Take our GME lessons and apply it here. I’m in for 120k. 100k in shares and 20 in calls. Gonna buy more calls tomorrow because gamma squeeze is important here. Thank you for the DD
2021-04-18 17:15:40,wallstreetbets,Honestly tho it's so far off its highs and its been shorted to death... feels pretty obvious at 9 dollars
2021-04-18 16:56:34,wallstreetbets,"still holding 400 shares at $13, near the merger.

I would like this to be $69 by EOY"
2021-04-18 17:59:02,wallstreetbets,Setting up to bug some CLOV. Adding this to the ape war chest.

2021-04-18 17:19:56,wallstreetbets,"After egregiously shorting it back down after the Vanguard 18% buy, I knew shorts had just gotten over their head. They ALWAYS dump it down on good news, it's such a basic mind-fuck; if your stock doesn't survive good news then it must be toast right?"
2021-04-18 16:43:45,wallstreetbets,I’m a believer. Hoping to buy more tomorrow.
2021-04-18 18:26:21,wallstreetbets,"I was holding some CLOV anyway and bought a little more on Friday during the run up. Shortsellers trying to put any company who is not entirely fraudulent out of business is worth punishing. And making money while doing it, why not?"
2021-04-18 18:29:05,wallstreetbets,Anyone no where I can buy $CLOV in Ireland? Seems to be quite hard to find
2021-04-18 17:38:09,wallstreetbets,Also let’s get this out there: this is a 3B market cap. We can stomp these shorts SO easily. By comparison RKT was 24 billion
2021-04-18 19:24:08,wallstreetbets,I'm in. bought 500 shares Fri
2021-04-18 18:08:03,wallstreetbets,I like the stock.

2021-04-18 17:15:02,wallstreetbets,I like the stock...
2021-04-18 17:46:16,wallstreetbets,Anything preceded with “no bullshit” is an insta-buy in my book 👍🏽
2021-04-18 18:50:08,wallstreetbets,"Here is my one and only concern regarding this (i profited Friday and left some in over weekend for possible squeeze) the short share borrow rate is insanely low and there are millions of lendable short shares. I’m slightly confused on how all of the numbers add up. Most squeezed I have witnessed get close to zero shorts available and usually have a high borrow rate. If the float is shorted in the 100s or even the 30s, why is the borrow rate so low? Does not make sense. Maybe someone smarter than me can explain."
2021-04-18 18:36:12,wallstreetbets,"We aren’t here to “fight back against the hedgies...” or any similar kind of political movement.  This is a sub of degenerates who try to get rich fast by making outlandish bets. 

See rule 5 on no politics."
2021-04-18 18:37:34,wallstreetbets,Hmmm... maybe after GME pays out
2021-04-18 18:24:59,wallstreetbets,Got a couple 5/21 11 dollar calls we shall see

2021-04-18 17:54:20,wallstreetbets,Is all of WSB about short squeezes & short term plays?  I’m looking for a board for long term value

2021-04-18 18:28:02,wallstreetbets,"This DD is truth. Remember only 3 billion marketcap even with NO short interest we can move this stock. Already in and will be selling other positions to buy more, Also don't panic if they drive it down at open  they are going to try to kill momentum just keep buying and holding by Friday we should see some serious gains."
2021-04-18 18:18:23,wallstreetbets,"Your account has been around for 3 months, you've only started posting yesterday, and you've only posted about CLOV.

2021-04-18 17:30:18,wallstreetbets,I’m pretty sure that the direct contracting was NOT included in any of their revenue projections in their investor presentation. That leads me to believe should be a nice beat and raise next earnings report.

2021-04-18 18:08:17,wallstreetbets,"Omg thank you!!!! I was posting about this on friday on gme mega thread and immediately people were bashing on me saying i was trying to distract from gme... I was not distracting i was simply saying hello we need to look at this its important due to the same gme squeeze effect. Im so glad this is cleared up. So i say to fight back, chamath is on our side and a good person. Clov is a good stock and doesn't deserve to be shorted so massively and under priced. I saw it at 148% Friday. Screw these shorters lets not let them win and save clov. I like the stock to! $CLOV to $100!"
2021-04-18 17:56:18,wallstreetbets,I wonder if this was part of those stocks they were trying to pay people to push recently because of the sec money to cover by April 22nd
2021-04-18 19:39:05,wallstreetbets,Instruction not clear. Ll buy more GME tomorrow
2021-04-18 18:10:13,wallstreetbets,"All I'm gonna say is there are a bunch of accounts that are only a few months old posting hype about CLOV...

That all said, to other people like me with no current position... unless you really believe in it dont put A LOT of money.  I'm just buying a few shares tomorrow for funsies.  Tails - this stock has been beaten like a virgin's dick and I doubt it will go down much more, heads - if some of this DD pans out we can laugh at angry 🌈🐻 and print some easy money."

2021-04-18 19:47:20,wallstreetbets,Don't think small. To make any real profit off CLOV you'd have to spend a few bucks anyway. Might as well take that money and buy GME for a much larger return

https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2018/04/14/fatal-collision-i-476/

While searching I also came across this! https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11152980/"
2021-04-18 17:40:18,wallstreetbets,"The goal is never going to be to create a perfect autopilot system with 100% safety & a 0% crash  rate - it is to make a system that performs better than human beings. If right now the average accident & fatal accident statistics were, hypothetically, 1 of every 75,000 trips in an automobile resulted in a crash with injury and 1 out of every 250,000 resulted in a crash involving loss of life, and an autopilot system was created that would reduce the number of accidents from 1:75000 to 1:300000 and the number of fatal accidents from 1:250000 to 1:1000000, wouldn’t that be a good thing? It would result in 3/4 crashes being avoided and 3/4 auto fatalities being avoided, which you would think would be good.

I don’t think America is ready yet culturally to accept that though. It makes perfect sense but people’s jimmies get rustled straight into orbit over this kind of thing. We readily accept when a driver makes an error and kills his passengers, as well as those of another vehicle, and call them tragic and terrible, but few would stop driving altogether or attempt to ban all drivers from traveling altogether due to the inherent safety risks. But when it’s an autonomous driving vehicle involved in an accident, in my opinion, most people are not able to digest that information and accept it as the inevitable reality of having self driving vehicles on the road alongside traditional automobiles is that there will be crashes and deaths. Hopefully as time progresses and more and more vehicles gain this technology and more drivers become familiar and competent with it, we will see a lot less horrific deaths in car crashes on our roadways every year."

2021-04-18 18:20:56,wallstreetbets,"I know, but it's the stock market man. You know how overdramatic and stupid people can be. People might just sell because they're worried others will sell. IDK. This will 99% have no effect but I'm saying that if it did, it would be good opportunity to invest more because once earnings arrive it won't matter."

2021-04-18 16:27:47,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely love the data. Once we have a ton more battery on the road, we can see what is safer. But honestly, at least where I’m from, people are just horrible humans and I wouldn’t doubt that a computer controlled car especially with someone paying attention while it does it’s thing is much safer than a human operated vehicle and that’s sad. Put us all on autopilot for all I care and let it be controlled somehow."
2021-04-18 16:34:15,wallstreetbets,This would make any statistician cringe so hard. The sampling bias here is so offensive. It's not even attempting to argue/support the tech in good faith.
2021-04-18 16:24:59,wallstreetbets,There was no one in the driver’s seat. What was that you were saying about human incompetence?
2021-04-18 16:29:54,wallstreetbets,"Uh, no. This happened because of human incompetence. Tesla says these cars still need someone in the driver's seat. Except this person was not."
2021-04-18 16:32:30,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha. Too true. If they start proving though that there are problems with the software, they will find a way to ban Tesla’s. Scary for stockholders for sure."

2021-04-18 18:15:47,wallstreetbets,"autopilot is also a play on words.

Automobile pilot => autopilot"
2021-04-18 19:33:33,wallstreetbets,"I mean, it is though. It drives itself. They just OPENLY admit it is a Beta level feature and requires CONSTANT verification that a human is at the wheel paying attention."
2021-04-18 19:12:16,wallstreetbets,That's a lot of pints.
2021-04-18 17:20:26,wallstreetbets,Apparently there’s a hack. Certainly not common knowledge amongst Tesla owners
2021-04-18 17:26:23,wallstreetbets,"Seems like the the 15 second checkup was a feature added as an update as a response to all the stories about drivers doing silly things like posting videos of themselves in the back while speeding down the highway.

Even now the car can't exactly make you drive the steering wheel.. It keeps driving while the annoying alarm goes off. Once you do it enough times it will block you from using autopilot for a while."
2021-04-18 19:23:37,wallstreetbets,its bs. people try to blame tesla fsd for their crashes all the time.
2021-04-18 19:51:48,wallstreetbets,It may just be that they weren't wearing a seatbelt and were thrown from the driver seat?
2021-04-18 19:54:38,wallstreetbets,Yep came here to say this. The orange thing totally works.

2021-04-18 17:37:02,wallstreetbets,It’s fun and it’s fun to show off. Also it works well enough on the highway
2021-04-18 18:11:10,wallstreetbets,"It’s less stressful and easier, in traffic and the highway particularly.  Stop and go traffic is the best.  You are paying attention. But it’s just easier."
2021-04-18 18:45:53,wallstreetbets,"I've found it much less stressful, especially in stop and go traffic.  I feel like it's alarm is a little sensitive when overtaking someone who just turned off the road, but overall I'm pleased with my purchase."
2021-04-18 17:19:50,wallstreetbets,Elon made a telepathic monkey. I don’t doubt it will be FSD relatively soon. But in it’s current state it’s absolutely not there

2021-04-18 17:55:53,wallstreetbets,"Okay? I can add weight on the front seat and avoid the load cell lol, nothing is tamper proof, only tamper evident.. Which is against Tesla's TOS, so yeah.. Can't blame Tesla for retarded consumers."
2021-04-18 19:44:58,wallstreetbets,No u dont
2021-04-18 16:51:50,wallstreetbets,Then the spooks can give your car an update to drive off of a bridge. No thanks
2021-04-18 16:41:25,wallstreetbets,"Even so, Tesla’s technology clearly is responsible to some extent here. Or at the very least it’s proven to be flawed. It’s called driverless after all."
2021-04-18 19:49:38,wallstreetbets,I'd like those in minis please
2021-04-18 17:30:28,wallstreetbets,"Not much of a hack, you can just wedge a fruit (usually an orange) on the steeringwheel to simulate a pressure on the wheel. The car would think you have your hands on it. 
https://youtu.be/TYZrehVQouc"
2021-04-18 17:29:17,wallstreetbets,"Knowing that an asymmetric weight on the wheel tricks the hand sensor is common enough knowledge, I think. It's not even Tesla specific; it can work on other cars that don't have capacitive sensing for hands."
2021-04-18 17:33:30,wallstreetbets,"Training Lace 12 oz Lacrosse Stick Training Weight, do the job"
2021-04-18 17:56:24,wallstreetbets,Probably just a steering wheel cover to trick the sensors.
2021-04-18 18:10:25,wallstreetbets,Yep. Friend of mine shoved a water bottle in the steering wheel on his way to Vegas. Watched a couple movies on the way up there
2021-04-18 17:33:33,wallstreetbets,People living like they have free health insurance. Goddamn.
2021-04-18 17:20:56,wallstreetbets,Said no one ever. Orange Tic Tac’s are the best.
2021-04-18 19:57:13,wallstreetbets,I feel like it would be really hard to maintain focus if you're not doing anything.
2021-04-18 17:24:10,wallstreetbets,"As an engineer I'll tell you that when it first seems like you're already there you're usually only 80% of the way there, and 80% of the time and effort is spent on that last 20%

If indeed it seems like you're about to crash ""frequently"" then there's a long way to go.

Let's be real here, they're making volunteers risk their health to train a neural network, which often requires thousands and thousands of iterations to get right."
2021-04-18 18:11:12,wallstreetbets,Reading this far in the comments I have deduced that wedging an orange in the steering wheel and (possibly) strapping a weight into the seatbelt seem like plausible bypasses for safety checks.
2021-04-18 18:01:37,wallstreetbets,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYZrehVQouc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYZrehVQouc)
2021-04-18 19:10:11,wallstreetbets,Yes they do.. I’ve seen on YouTube
2021-04-18 19:19:06,wallstreetbets,"Theoretically they could have a minimum weight, say 35kg/77lbs. Now who wants to load that sort of weight in and out of a driver's seat?"
2021-04-18 19:22:09,wallstreetbets,That won't stop media from painting the blame on Tesla.
2021-04-18 19:56:26,wallstreetbets,I don't care if you believe
2021-04-18 16:57:00,wallstreetbets,"Rofl. There is always someone. So I won’t lie, yes it’s possible but I don’t give them a reason to want to kill me so I’ll trust them over the millions of people texting and driving and swerving into my lane daily."
2021-04-18 17:24:13,wallstreetbets,"It's not called driverless. Find me one piece of official Tesla literature that refers to the autopilot product as driverless.

Just because the public names a concept inappropriately, doesn't mean it makes it that. I could call a woodchipper a sex doll. I can't sue PowerKing when I stick my dick in it."
2021-04-18 18:03:24,wallstreetbets,"This video is 3 years old at this point. To keep FSD engaged now, you have to actually give a nudge to the steering wheel, not just apply pressure."
2021-04-18 19:23:35,wallstreetbets,exactly
2021-04-18 17:38:23,wallstreetbets,"Most cars nowadays have weight sensors on the seats (that are linked to seatbelt sirens), surely Teslas have the same feature incorporated into their cars??"
2021-04-18 18:45:54,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t work on any newer  version.  And if you trust AP1.0 you gonna die.
2021-04-18 18:58:52,wallstreetbets,"Ah, so thats why americans like to shoot eachother! To not waste their insurance.

At this point I would not be surprised"
2021-04-18 17:22:22,wallstreetbets,"Orange tictacs? 

Mmm, an aristocrat"
2021-04-18 17:22:59,wallstreetbets,I like the type of tic tacs that allegedly perform physics defying maneuvers flying around navy testing ranges
2021-04-18 17:27:01,wallstreetbets,Can you make volunteers do anything?
2021-04-18 18:13:27,wallstreetbets,">Let's be real here, they're making volunteers risk their health to train a neural network 

Worse, they're making volunteers risk the life and health of everyone around them who didn't volunteer but might get hit anyway.

I like Tesla overall but they are making a serious mistake by rolling out Autopilot like this."
2021-04-18 18:04:15,wallstreetbets,This guy in the video must have really good confidence in the autopilot haha. He's not even looking at the road.  He's looking at the dash and down.
2021-04-18 19:26:15,wallstreetbets,"People go out of their ways to bypass stuff like this all the time, there are other ways of bypassing sensors like a load cell such as a clamp or if you have no warranty, you can even do a simple circuit and hook up a bypass toggle switch."
2021-04-18 18:25:59,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't it also slow the car to a stop if the weight sensor on the driver seat disengages? I don't have a Tesla, but I thought that was the case"
2021-04-18 19:39:46,wallstreetbets,"This.  It's also why the FSD is basically worthless.  You have to jiggle the damn wheel every 30 seconds or it starts flipping out.  It's easier to just control the vehicle, takes less engagement than remembering to perform some unnatural movement on a straightaway.

&#x200B;

I used to take an old pipe clamp and tighten it around the wheel.  Not because my hands weren't on it, but because I don't iron grip steering wheels and it was constantly barking at me to grip it tighter.  Then they added the jiggle requirement and I was out."
2021-04-18 19:41:11,wallstreetbets,I mean you guys keep repeating this but it’s clear they still did it somehow. Unless the cops put the drivers body in the back seat because Texas loves oil
2021-04-18 19:51:29,wallstreetbets,"2 pound ankle weight is all you need, strap it to the 9pm position and it's as good as hands on the wheels as far as the car is concerned."
2021-04-18 17:46:53,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, those *should* disable autopilot / FSD betas nowadays (they didn't in the past), and are harder to bypass. But you *can* bypass them, and fuck you if you do.

The wheel bypass is somewhat legit IMO since torque sensing sucks balls and requires constant just-enough but not too much wiggling even with your hands on the wheel."
2021-04-18 17:45:12,wallstreetbets,Most vehicles only have it for occupants. It assumes the driver is in the seat since the vehicle had to be shifted out of park and into drive.
2021-04-18 19:00:23,wallstreetbets,Well the Republican plan is to die quick if we get sick or get hurt.
2021-04-18 17:51:43,wallstreetbets,That's the tricky part
2021-04-18 19:34:34,wallstreetbets,"True, I did that to my ride on mower. But it took effort to do that. The Tesla self driving fails are low effort and opportunistic in nature.

The other thing is, actually going to the effort of doing something like that shows a dedication to circumventing safety devices where as sticking an orange in the steering wheel is pure fucking laziness on the part of the manufacturer."
2021-04-18 19:37:40,wallstreetbets,"Geez, how hard is this.  A severed hobo hand packing-taped to the steering wheel and the limbless torso in the seat should do the trick. You don't even need the whole thing."
2021-04-18 19:02:34,wallstreetbets,Backpack with your laptop and a few books?
2021-04-18 17:52:32,wallstreetbets,"I agree. Anyone stupid enough to even want to be a passenger in their own car deserves smiting before they kill innocent people... I wish I had the money for a Tesla and most likely never will, but trusting the car to drive and avoid obstacles is something I'd never feel comfortable doing, even 10 years from now."

2021-04-18 19:55:38,wallstreetbets,My 2015 Honda will display a warning if a backpack like that is in the passenger seat as it assumes based on the weight it might be a kid and disables the air bags.  I would assume the Tesla would also require at least 70 lbs or so.

My post sounded more negative than it should have. I'm quite lucky to have a well paying job, a wife with a well paying job, etc. There are things that could be better, but I'm in a better position than the vast majority of people. I exercise, etc.

My negative thoughts are mainly regarding just trying to make sure I feel like I'm using my advantages to the fullest extent and that I'm just not floating through life.

Here is my reply because I can't let shit go:

---

That's easy to say in retrospect. But GME's build was 100% organic.

DFV's content was peak WSB-style and he had been posting it for a year.

When things exploded in January the mod team did a fantastic job just keeping this place from falling apart altogether.

Apes are a meme that wore out their welcome, but the mod team, especially zjz, are some of the best on reddit."

No, unless investors are nuts, it won't impact shit since there's no liability for Tesla (thus nothing to discount from the SP) and headlines do mention that there was no driver. The autopilot (not even FSD) was designed as a driver-**assist** feature and Tesla explicitly tells you that you need an attentive driver on the driver's seat with both hands on the wheel. This is just your usual TSLA FUD pushed by the 🌈🐻 TSLAQ cult.

Do you blame automakers when a drunk driver dies in a car accident? It's worse because in this case those retards didn't even have a driver on the driver's seat."

Book of Matthew 17-21:


17 “We have here only five loaves of tendies and two quarters,” they answered.

18 “Bring them here to me,” he said. 19 And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five tendies and the two quarters and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the tendies. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. 20 They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of tendies that were left over. 21 The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, besides women and children."

2021-04-18 19:53:13,wallstreetbets,"People who have been here a while saw it start at like $2 or whatever which is when the first people started talking about it. When it started to come up in like December iirc it started gaining a bit more attention around here, and everyone got in on the party when it actually got past like $20. Over a very short period of time, it went up to like 50, then 70, then 100, then it actually got to 420 lol. That's when the play ended, pretty much. However a bunch of newbies came in here and saw what was going on and also saw all the literal bs that was being posted to hype up the stock (I was pretty proud of a ""DD"" I posted that asserted that the stock had the potential to reach $36,000~). These newbies got in late, got stuck with bags, and never left. They tried to change the culture of the board into something that I would describe as antithetical to what it was before. 

I think a lot of people on wsb before then would love to work at a hedge fund, and in some ways admired the people that did. Now you have people making cringey comments about ""hedgepigs"" and misunderstanding the dynamics of the market at fundamental level but still getting upvotes because it confirms the newbie bias. The people who correct them get downvoted because of the same confirmation bias, and it leads to the board becoming a completely different vibe than it was before."

Also, they have far more brick and mortar retail exposure than PYPL and SQ which is why their growth slowed during Covid.  Curtail of live sporting event severely cut their sports betting revenue too.

An interesting comparison for brick and mortar payment processing would be Visa and Mastercard who, unlike Paysafe, both reported a severe contraction in revenue last year due to Covid.

\-- Visa: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%)

\-- Mastercard: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%)

The combined EV/EBITDA multiples of these two payment processors with negative revenue growth would put Paysafe’s share price at $25

Their combined EV/Revenue multiples would put Paysafe at $48"

Projected $1.5 billion revenue, $362 million free cash flow, 30-35% margins, $105 billion transactional volume for 2021. They generally have much better cash flow than fintech competitors.

2. From   published data on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm,   bill, GPN, Paysign with a collective revenue growth rate of \~12.5%.   Paysafe’s 10.6% rev growth projection (conservatively pegged to   fintech/online commerce) excludes planned inorganic growth and projected   10X iGaming growth (55% CAGR)

2021-04-18 14:22:35,wallstreetbets,Thanks for your answer
2021-04-18 15:43:55,wallstreetbets,"But isn't the profit available to reinvest is the **net** profit (aka net income) though, not the gross? The net is what is left after paying for all costs incurred by the company (which you stated, so I'm not sure why you aren't using it). Using your mindset from the post of ""How many years to recoup the cost of buying the entire company"", the net profit is what you could put in your own pocket to make back your money.

Net income (or rather, net income per share) is also the metric used to calculate P/E ratio, which means that your value of 10.8 in the top post is incorrect. PSFE had a per share profit of -$1.01 for the most recent quarter, which means they have a P/E ratio of (price/share) / (income/share) = $13.59/-$1.01 = **-**13.5.

By the way, Paysafe has had increasingly negative net profits since 2018. However, a main driver of that appears to be depreciation of assets, impairments, etc. Revenue and EBIT (except for COVID) are increasing every year, so profits could well become positive soon enough as those negatives drop off the sheets.

For reference, here are [Paysafe's SEC filings](https://ir.paysafe.com/regulatory-filings/all-sec-filings). I used the financial statements from the most recent filing, which is Item 8 of form 20-F."

And yes, growth stagnated during Covid due their heavy exposure to brick-and-mortar retail and live sporting events.  This is why Visa and Mastercard both reported around -9% decline in revenue during that time, while Paysafe held stable."

The canadian federal government and bank of Canada have also regulated banks to adhere to something called a stress test for mortgage applications. Unlike the US where any idiot with zero credit and no job history can get a 30 year mortgage, here in Canada you have to actually meet qualifications to get a mortgage +prime%. There is no 30 year mortgage in Canada either. All mortgages upto 20% down payment are insured by the canadian government."

2021-04-18 18:24:52,wallstreetbets,"I don't think RBC is suddenly a $33.75 stock, but the volume also indicates something weird. There wasn't a single trade AH Thursday/PM Friday, Friday was a low volume day (which isn't crazy - it's a low volume stock), but then you get a 4:01/2pm dump, of like 30% of the total daily volume that indicates OTC trading being reported to the ticker then. It also jumps it by a dollar to an ATH. Then we see absolutely no trades until 4:29 when about 10k goes through at that price, then absolutely nothing until 5pm when a little goes through close to the original close, then at 5:14pm we have a decent sized chunk go through, and then finally 2 of that weird 448 block that's causing all the consternation paired weirdly with a 3 share trade at a normal price.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ry/after-hours-trades](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ry/after-hours-trades)

So here's the next weird thing - BNS has no after hour trades past 4:02 until one block gets sent through at 5:14pm. [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bns/after-hours-trades](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bns/after-hours-trades)

TD? No trades after 4:02 until a large block goes through at 5:07 then a final one at? You guessed it - 5:14 - [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/td/after-hours-trades](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/td/after-hours-trades)

BMO breaks the pattern a little, just has absolutely nothing past 4:02 - [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bmo/after-hours-trades](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bmo/after-hours-trades)

CIBC? back to it - very little past 4:02 (literally 6 shares, could easily be retail) until a huge block is traded at 5:07, then a final amount at? 5:14 [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/cm/after-hours-trades](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/cm/after-hours-trades)

Bell Canada tied in too, same pattern - huge amount reported at 4:00/01 as evidence of OTC block trades, a big sale at 5:07pm, a smaller sale at 5:14pm then nothing. [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bce/after-hours-trades](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bce/after-hours-trades)

Block trades on ToS - [https://imgur.com/gallery/V3o7bce](https://imgur.com/gallery/V3o7bce)

AH volume as a % of total volume - Fidelity, GS, MS, CS, Citi, WF, BoA, Deutsche all between 0.22%-5.42%

BMO - 24.14%  
BNS - 24.14%  
CM - 51.51%  
TD - 47.41%  
RY - around 25%

Now a lot of those trades are at 4:00/01 so they were probably OTC trades made during the day, but in CM/TD someone traded a ton at 5:07pm. And then everything goes radio silent after 5:14pm except for that weird 448 $33.75 ""glitch"" in RY. Meanwhile every American bank stock, CS, UBS, Barclays, Santander, etc keep having normal low volume trading up to 8pm. I don't think Canadian banks are going bankrupt or we'll be able to buy RY at $33.75 Monday, but is it possible someone who invested in all these got hit with a margin call & had positions liquidated Friday? Could it just be someone moving assets around?

Add ENB, BAM, TRP, CP, BCE, MFC, CNQ, SU to the list. Huge trades that either happen at 4:01 or were OTC block trades reported then, huge blocks sold at 4:44 or 5:07, someone closing out smaller positions at 5:14 & like no other AH activity.

tl;dr I don't think RBC is in trouble, but I'm pretty sure someone was liquidated (or at the least someone wanted to get the fuck out of a ton of positions real quick)."

What I believe happened is someone had a bunch of put options they exercised. Since they sold to someone in afterhours, the bid/ask spread likely got skewed where the bid placement was something like 30.00-500, 34.00-10, 34.25-1k —— sell 95.00-100, 100.00-10, 115.00-20k. You will often see this happen with low volume mid and low cap stocks. I have made comments before about how aftermarket options exercising is a game that destroys lives and the reason I don’t trade spreads(as well as early exercise risk). It is literally about tricking people and their algos into selling a position based on bid/ask spread and when the stocks are dumped in order to take advantage of a lack of bid/ask spreads. Imagine making 20k in a weekend, now imagine doing it on a daily basis because you have the computers and the money to monitor everything(think market makers). It’s all a game to them and they’re trying to steal your money."

So at the beginning of the covid crises, the Federal Reserve temporarily changed some of the rules for Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) to incentivize banks to continue to lend in an uncertain economy. This allowed the banks to take on a *bit* more risk in order to keep the economy afloat. 

This rule change expired last month and given that we are in a frothy bull market, you can imagine JPM’s asset ratio has changed quite a bit in the last year. Selling bonds is a good way to balance TLAC requirements, particularly when interest rates are the lowest they’ve been in a very long time."

Wealth Simple, apart from being bare bones, still makes money on the spread so you will pay more for your trade it just won’t be in fees, and they also charge extra money on exchange fees. In addition, Wealth Simple is not a money maker, it’s a loss leader. Meaning they are purposefully losing money to gain client share before starting to charge, which you can expect some sort of fee structure in the near future. It’s business 101 hombre.

2021-04-18 14:21:53,wallstreetbets,"There is truth in this comment response but also misinformation.

A little over a year ago, $CLF produced zero steel as they were only a mining company. The vast majority of ""dilution"" being mentioned is primarily from acquiring $AKS and $MT's USA assets over the last year to become the largest HRC steel producer in North America. This occurs with most acquisitions... for example, $AKS shareholders would be pissed if they didn't get $CLF shares when they were acquired.

Thus comparisons against historic pricing for $CLF by itself are indeed very flawed. One would need to include $AKS and the portion of $MT's USA assets as part of any historical analysis. But ""dilution"" by itself isn't an answer as the company is now three companies in one. This is why $CLF's revenue is expected to be 1,000% higher this year than the previous year.

At present, $CLF's [guidance](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Cleveland-Cliffs+%28CLF%29+sees+Q1+2021+adjusted+EBITDA+of+approximately+%24500+million/18197647.html) for the year has the company earning EBITDA profit of 40% of its current market cap this year alone. What kind of valuation one wants to give the company is indeed up for debate. Note that guidance is based on 2021 HRC pricing average of $975 and future contracts currently have that average at around \~$1250.

For a chart on how the HRC steel production landscape has changed in the USA, [see this image](https://stocktwits.com/saycheese/message/306429904)."
2021-04-18 15:02:30,wallstreetbets,"Yeah if OP thinks the company is going to hit all time high valuation then that would mean a market cap of just under 15 billion. It currently has a market cap of 9 billion at 18 dollars per share. That would mean a peak share price of 28 dollars.

2021-04-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I analyzed all 700+ buy and sell recommendations made by Jim Cramer in 2021. Here are the results. **Preamble:** Jim Cramer is definitely a controversial figure. While argument can be made on whether he is on the side of retail investors or not, what I really wanted to know was how his stock picks are performing. Surprisingly, there were no trackers for the performance of Cramer’s pick in his program (his program is Mad Money, for those who are not familiar). 

**Where the data is from:** [here](https://madmoney.thestreet.com/screener/index.cfm). All the 19,201 stock picks made by Cramer are listed here. His stock picks are updated here daily. While Cramer mentions a lot of stocks in his program, I only considered the stocks that Cramer specifically recommended that you should buy or sell. (I have ignored the stocks where Cramer says he likes/dislikes the stock since I felt that it’s a vague statement and cannot be considered as a buy/sell recommendation). 

**Analysis:** There were 725 buy/sell recommendations made by Cramer in 2021. Out of this, 651 were Buy and 74 were Sell. For both sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods. 

a. One Day

b. One Week 

c. One Month

d. Price Change till date 

I also checked what percentage of Cramer’s calls were right across different time periods. 

**Results:** 

https://preview.redd.it/v6v86fgm5yt61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=46d99ad37e0f07803910a0ee250883aee7be43ee

 Cramer made a total of 651 buy recommendations over the course of the past 4 months. If you had invested in every single stock, he recommended and then pulled out the next day, the returns were a staggering 555%. He was also right on 58.9% of the calls he made (Benchmark being 50% since anyone can pick a random stock and the probability of the stock going up is 50%). The weekly performance returns are also a respectable 42% but he was barely touching 50% in the percentage of right picks. One month from his recommendations, the stock return is an abysmal -223% and he was wrong more than he was right on his calls. The returns till date are also phenomenal with 446% return and Cramer being right a whopping 63.6% in his stock picks. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7tt84a2o5yt61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bc245cf01922010a13705e721d564a4299ebbac

Cramer’s sell recommendations performed better than his buy recommendations across different time periods. This stat is particularly commendable since we were in a predominantly bull market across the last 4 months. 57.5% of the stocks he recommended as a sell dropped in price the next day with a cumulative return of -118.9%. This trend is observed across the time period with returns for the sell recommendations being negative. The only statistic that is working against Cramer’s sell recommendation is the percentage of right picks till date being only 42%. But still the cumulative return for all the stocks was -206%. Please note that Cramer made only 74 sell recommendations against a whopping 651 buy recommendations during the same period of time. 

**Limitations of the analysis**

The above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, Cramer has made a total of 19K recommendations in his program. I have only analyzed his 2021 recommendations. The site which provides the data is extremely limited in terms of how we can access the data. Also, currently the data is pulled from street.com which was earlier owned by Cramer. They update the data everyday after the show, but I could not verify if they go back and change the calls down the line (very unlikely with it being a large business). Also, for the return calculations, I have only used the closing price of the stock across the time periods. The returns can theoretically be higher if you consider the intra-day highs and lows. 

**Conclusion** 

No matter how we feel about Cramer, the one-day returns on both his buy and sell recommendations have been phenomenal. I started the analysis thinking that the returns would be mediocre at best as there were no trackers actively tracking the returns from his calls. But the data points otherwise. It seems that there is a lot of scope for short term plays based on Cramer’s recommendation. Let me know what you think!

2021-04-18 16:31:38,wallstreetbets,"OP: I've fixed your spreadsheet comparing Jim Cramer to the market. In a massive bull market like the one we're in, it's insanely easy to pick stonks that go up. Because to some degree, all stocks move with the market.

Instead of using gains as an indicator, you should be using the general market (Any S&P 500 index works, I used SPY, but easy to change if you have another preference).

It is interesting in the short term (1-day) Cramer beats the market. But this is likely a self-fulfilling prophecy as people buy what he recommends, driving the price up.

I also replaced your ""cumulative % gains"" with a median. Since Cumulative gains don't mean shit. If I buy 3 stocks, and they all go up 10%, I made 10%, not 30%. However Median (or middle point), takes the middle performing stock. So you know 50% of stocks did better than that number, while 50% did worst.

2021-04-18 12:53:48,wallstreetbets,I wonder how much of his 1 day recommendations are a result of someone with a  huge platform declaring a stock buy/sell.  Chicken or the egg?
2021-04-18 19:11:16,wallstreetbets,"How did you calculate the one-day return? Did you take the previous day's closing price or the opening price the next day as your staying point?

Using the previous day's closing price, would definitely skew the results. Retail investors will never be able to get the previous day's closing price after a stock was picked on Cramer's show."
2021-04-18 13:29:41,wallstreetbets,How can the cumulative loss be more than 100%?
2021-04-18 11:49:52,wallstreetbets,He helped me get started back when I had no idea what I was doing (I still don't) bought roku and crowdstrike off his recommendations and both went over 250% for me last year.
2021-04-18 11:41:39,wallstreetbets,"A slight critique to your analysis: the probability that a stock goes up or down the next day is not 50%.  

I mean it might be 50% but that is not a given. 

Your analysis might benefit from comparing to the following day advance decline ratio instead.  Then decide if rising water floats all boats."
2021-04-18 12:00:19,wallstreetbets,He could get a daily return on any stock because he has a platform to the financial world. He takes money to pump stock’s and right now he takes money to dissuade people from buying certain stocks. I hope they give A YouTuber his job after all this changes the game but he’s been trying to safeguard himself by talking out both sides of his mouth with these stocks. He’s fauci with a rat like attitude.
2021-04-18 13:02:43,wallstreetbets,"It’s not that he’s “right” or “wrong” on the stocks he picks. It’s that he talks about a stock and everyone and their grandma drops their life savings into it - pumping the stock for a bit before the inevitable correction/crash. 

IMO, the stuff they do with regards to stocks and picking/choosing what gets covered is a form of market manipulation... but what do I know? I’m just a cat."
2021-04-18 18:56:59,wallstreetbets,"Isn’t this the definition of a pump and dump? Make a recommendation to buy, people FOMO in, stock goes up that day/next day, the entity sponsoring the recommendation (not necessarily Cramer) sells, stock goes down. Thus, why his buy performance is great over one day, decent over a week, and terrible over a month."

2021-04-18 11:59:05,wallstreetbets,"One day returns? How much of that is a chicken and egg situation, though? We’ve seen him admit he can pump up or tank a stocks price almost instantaneously. Of course his next day numbers are going to look great. 
The problem is, a month down the road all the MM have that data and they certainly use it, hence the -223%. Take a look at hedgies returns from their moves based on his “predictions”. We’d all probably shit ourselves.
He markets to retail investors. One thing we’ve seen through this entire saga is that we are tiny little pawns in their little monopoly game and they certainly don’t want us to make money. For now, anyway...."
2021-04-18 12:06:10,wallstreetbets,"> If you had invested in every single stock, he recommended and then  pulled out the next day, the returns were a staggering 555%.

What happened first, the chicken or the egg?

&#x200B;

>He was also  right on 58.9% of the calls he made (Benchmark being 50% since anyone  can pick a random stock and the probability of the stock going up is  50%)

2021-04-18 11:31:01,wallstreetbets,"I swear i have wanted to do something like this since I started watching Cramer when mad money came out in 2005.  He got all of us into stocks, he was like nothing anyone had ever seen.  Not sure if you guys were watching him back then, but we all loved him.  We all thought he was fucking insane and we all followed his advice.  This analysis, was done very well.  Thanks @op.  It has confirmed for me, what I always believed.  Cramer, like it or not, can actually move the market.  555% next day pull out.  Holy shit.  That’s too high a number not to believe he is moving the market.  The ceo of my company has been on Cramer three times.  We saw a massive spike every time Cramer recommend a buy, which he always does.  Fuck me.  555%.  That’s fucking too high not to believe he has influence"
2021-04-18 11:39:05,wallstreetbets,He didn't start being bullish on tsla until it was over $400.

No offense, but it would be pretty easy to have such a high percentage of success when one is being told what to say by the HFs who are setting up the PnD."
2021-04-18 11:34:45,wallstreetbets,Is this accounting for buying the day he recommends (AH) or the next morning?
2021-04-18 11:42:36,wallstreetbets,"Thank-you for doing this. I was wondering if anyone had tracked him, and what the results were."
2021-04-18 11:53:26,wallstreetbets,Thank you for this
2021-04-18 12:17:49,wallstreetbets,"I was hoping that one of you artists would actually do this. I've been wondering about this myself for quite some time. My initial thought was that it goes up then down and then eventually back up after a year not so much four months. But i would assume the price to date may also include those that are currently in their boom phase. 

I find it curious that a month out from every one of their recommendations it goes down quite a bit. He might be team them up for shorting."
2021-04-18 12:54:16,wallstreetbets,The same day accuracy of his predictions is probably bc the fomo factor in his followers
2021-04-18 13:06:51,wallstreetbets,"Noones said this so far and it rlly should - Thanks, this was super informative"
2021-04-18 15:40:49,wallstreetbets,"As a GME  bagholder, fuck Jim Cramer"
2021-04-18 15:58:49,wallstreetbets,"There's a seven percent bias in the S&P500 for the last two decades, 57% win/days, 43% loss/day, I'd say his short term predictions fall right in line with that.

Therefore, the dude is mediocre for short term plays, and sub par for <30. Someone else said 30 dte puts on all of Cramer's picks, and that sounds about right. Long term plays? Sure? It's hard to recommend that, especially when SPY and QQQ are extremely hot."
2021-04-18 18:46:24,wallstreetbets,"Hi there! Love the analysis. My main concern with the 1-day return is that the ""price at recommendation"" is the closing price a couple hours before the show actually airs. So the 1-day returns might be much less because a trader probably can't actually purchase at the price listed. For instance, looking at BAC (recommended April 15th 2021), the 1 day change is listed as 1.06%. If I'm understanding correctly, this is calculated as 100\*(39.15-38.74)/38.74 (because April 16th market close was $39.15, and April 15th market close was $38.74).

But the show actually happens after market close (6pm eastern time). Looking in Yahoo Finance, I see that there was a spike in after-hours price for BAC, during the time period that mad money airs:  


April 15th, 6:25pm - $38.82

April 15th, 6:50pm - $39.03

&#x200B;

To be fair, this is a period of 25 minutes, so maybe traders with after-hours-trading enabled would be able to lock in a decent price somewhere within this time span (I'm not sure if the recommendation was made closer to 6:25pm or 6:50pm). But if the 6:50pm price is representative of the price a trader could get after the stock is recommended on the show, the 1.06% 1-day return goes down to 0.3% (100\*(39.15-39.03)/39.03).

&#x200B;

Of course, this is just one example, but this could be a big drag on the shorter timespans (like 1-day). This probably wouldn't affect the longer timespans much though."
2021-04-18 19:08:48,wallstreetbets,"Here is the fly in your ointment. If I have missed something, please let me know.  
Using the 4-15 Goldman Sachs recommendation.  Goldman closed 4-15 at 4:00 PM EDT at 335.35 which is the buy price in your analysis. Cramer's Mad Money airs at 6:00 EDT when I assume he made his buy recommendation. Next day 4-16 it opened at 338.90. It would not have been possible to buy at Cramer's price on the 16 th at the open."
2021-04-18 19:23:14,wallstreetbets,"This is highly inaccurate.

His show is on after the market closes. He talks only about stocks that already gapped up. 

Your analysis is as if he made the recommendation at or before market opening.

Fucking dumb"
2021-04-18 19:51:38,wallstreetbets,Try it when the market is crashing.  That's where it gets real.
2021-04-18 11:50:40,wallstreetbets,"Found Jim Cramer’s burner account, nice try Jim!"
2021-04-18 12:05:27,wallstreetbets,"Right, so his job is to hype stock up, and day traders watch this jabroni and no nothing and parrot what he says and do what he says so they buy get 2% gains and paper hand out next day.

3 out of 5 days, you end net positive you had a good week.

This is the old way of doing things where if you listen to the experts, you will be okay, and the system keeps working with you getting your 5% returns while getting 30% returns.

Forget that I am never listening to the TV or Newspaper again.

They all lie. Even if they tell the truth that 1 lie at the end is what will burn you the most."

2021-04-18 11:13:48,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit...This is very good DD well done OP.  Basically, whatever he gets LOTS of eyeballs.  Hence, he's going to help sustain any momentum or support a given price with what he says.

Obviously long-term it's all bullshit but you can't deny that he gets tons of visibility and at least SOME of that will translate into gains."
2021-04-18 11:48:20,wallstreetbets,Is this accounting for those that tell him what to say on the show buying up that stock the day before and sometimes week prior and selling on recommendation day knowing volume will be so high due to his recommendations and price will be up that they will never be caught?
2021-04-18 11:50:06,wallstreetbets,"The one thing that people never seem to understand is that the world is completely different now than it was last week. Historic data or performance cannot be the foundation of your trades. In terms of probability, from now every one is his picks could go through the roof or fail miserably, his past performance does not give you any indication of what the future will hold."
2021-04-18 11:53:51,wallstreetbets,"Autistic ape, can’t read or write, currently eating a crayon from weeks ago.

But from you information, day traders only make money off Cramer pics 🧐 which makes sense now based of volume and hype but in long-term you have 50/50 split.

He’s a entertainer not a advisor. I hope people are aware of this."
2021-04-18 12:23:20,wallstreetbets,tldr: His picks are green only for 1 day on average and the gains fade after that. Pretty much single day pump & dumps.
2021-04-18 11:42:29,wallstreetbets,Nice job OP. Shoutout to Cramer for what he does. None of us are ever right & it is an extremely difficult job to analyze a stock appropriately.

2021-04-18 11:41:22,wallstreetbets,"Great DD. But I think you are interpreting numbers very poorly. Stocks go up rather than down 75% of time (real statistics, look it up). So taking that in consideration Cramers 40% is actually underperforming the market, now adding to that 2021 is some of the most phenomenal years for the stock market and he only hit those numbers? I’d say not very good. 
Now I personally been noticing his recommendations and him switching from “it’s a complete garbage” to “buy buy buy” and I have to tell you he chases the stocks mostly. He hates stocks until they are sky high and that’s where he starts being interested."

2021-04-18 11:45:58,wallstreetbets,"We're in a bull market. Clearly Cramer is going to be right more than he is wrong. This has nothing to do with Cramer having great picks, but more on the current market as a whole."
2021-04-18 11:50:42,wallstreetbets,Nice write-up. Cramer still failed to warn us about the 2008 subprime meltdown.
2021-04-18 11:52:29,wallstreetbets,One day returns are useless. Cramer recos are given after hours and stocks gap up next day. Ideally all your returns should be calculated from the price of that stock on open the next day of all his after hour recommendations.

2021-04-18 11:55:22,wallstreetbets,Cramer is a hook!
2021-04-18 11:58:17,wallstreetbets,"This is obviously skewed by the broader market correction. All his 2021 picks made within a month of that couple week pull back were automatically crushed purely due to macro tailwinds. Further he states these are long term investments and given the hype around SPACs the focus of much of his picks were in that high risk area, which he outlined as such in depth, and all got crushed. Lastly if you use the spac listing price vs the price at time of airing he’s probably looking more favorably in that 1 month window. What’s it look like using 2020 to date? To the comments saying he should go to jail for pumping — He doesn’t get paid to promote stocks and is actually unable to own any equity position due to his contractual agreements which he mentions on the show repeatedly."
2021-04-18 12:04:18,wallstreetbets,"Who wants to help put together an LETF that goes long on his picks then shorts them 24 hours later and does the reverse for his sell reccomendations?

Within a less than a week whatever he said about a stock has been forgotten because people (or institutions more likely) took their short-term daily profits and moved on to whatever he says in the following 24-48hrs. This isn’t “investing,” it’s literally market manipulation."
2021-04-18 12:16:34,wallstreetbets,All I got from this is that he uses his show to pump and dump.

2021-04-18 12:25:39,wallstreetbets,"It looks a lot like pump and dump... I mean, when he says ""buy"" he doesn't say ""buy for one day"" ... 

It could also be not intended, or the Cramer effect, but I guess that's it. Also, as pointed out in other comments, if he does his predictions at evening so the orders can only be done AH or PM, it means that most of the trades are only available to ""certain"" actors. 

It would be Indeed interesting to check the comparison of the first day based on opening price Vs closing price, to check whether that 500+% is really ""real"" for the retail traders too"
2021-04-18 12:26:13,wallstreetbets,Cramer recommends after hours so next day performance is not the best way. He can recommend buy/sell based on AH performance or earnings results. The next day performance should be close/open not previous close.

I would expect to see higher highs and lower lows, which could be an interesting play. 

Since his program runs AH, it could be a play to buy one month puts following his buy recommendations, and perhaps the returns could be greater if you only considered smaller cap stocks."

If you guess a stock will go up while 70% of the market is doing well, your odds were above 50%. If you pick a stock to go up while the rest of the market is crashing, your odds were below 50%."

2021-04-18 13:57:18,wallstreetbets,"It is probably the same as what happens with Elon, Elon speaks and the people listen. He has directly impacted prices with a harmless tweet more than once.

Cramer is so mainstream that he speaks and people buy/sell accordingly which impacts the price. Almost a self fulfilling prophesy. Does that have any probability?"
2021-04-18 13:58:13,wallstreetbets,Did you at the initial signals price before or after he made his statement?
2021-04-18 14:00:32,wallstreetbets,"Either 

a) when he talks, people listen and they buy. 

b) he knows what the hedge funds are buying up before the market opens or the previous day. 

Hence the great one day returns, he isn’t a genius."
2021-04-18 14:04:16,wallstreetbets,"All I remember from him is ""Bear Stearns is FINE, don't take your money out of Bear Stearns."" Fuck him forever and ever. He's 1000% going to Hell."
2021-04-18 14:05:36,wallstreetbets,"yea i mean the guy was a hedge fund manager. you all say he knew the dirty tricks, which he did, but he also does his research on the financial side of things (mostly)"
2021-04-18 14:07:47,wallstreetbets,"Why are you looking at the summed return? Needs to be an average.

What does it look like vs the index?"
2021-04-18 14:08:14,wallstreetbets,Half a year when everything is threw the roof? My 5 year old could predict it when people are telling him what they want. Look at whole career and in the biggest moment of his career when he knew about the situation looked right in the camera and said don’t take out of Bears S. Lost any respect for him after that.
2021-04-18 14:08:15,wallstreetbets,"Man, you are a maniac!"
2021-04-18 14:10:12,wallstreetbets,Cramer aka the biggest hedgie pump and dump scammo in history
2021-04-18 14:11:17,wallstreetbets,Cant manipulate a market if he kept “guessing” wrong
2021-04-18 14:15:34,wallstreetbets,But wouldn’t merely having a public platform and telling people to do something make them do it and make you correct? Everyone Sell the price is going down! Ok! We sold! The price goes down. So being public is the only reason he was ever accurate.
2021-04-18 14:17:01,wallstreetbets,"The data to me just confirms that he's setting up pump and dumps. A lot of people are watching him and listening to him, so if he makes a stock pick, a lot of people will Fomo in or panic sell the next day which has that effect on the stock price. Then hedgies are dumping within a week and after hedgies are done dumping, retailers start dumping as well."
2021-04-18 14:20:23,wallstreetbets,Any chance you could do this analysis where it starts 1-2 days from the recommendation so we could see post Cramer P&D?
2021-04-18 14:23:04,wallstreetbets,"How much of that one-day rise do you think was due to him pumping the stock on his show?

Does that pattern sound like this?

**Day:** Excitement Buy

**Week:** Paper Hands 

**Month:** Buyer's Remorse

**Til:** Second Wave Climb (Buying the Dip)"
2021-04-18 14:23:38,wallstreetbets,"Cramer is the king of the pump and subsequent dump. Not surprising. He picks solid companies most of the time and we’re in a bull market, that should be skewing the metrics"
2021-04-18 14:24:28,wallstreetbets,I really liked his book
2021-04-18 14:27:36,wallstreetbets,"What I’m getting from this is , if you can’t time the one day buy suggestion , wait one month to buy and you should get decent returns in another month or 2"
2021-04-18 14:33:37,wallstreetbets,Imagine making money in a bull market. Crazy shit.
2021-04-18 14:37:05,wallstreetbets,"Shouldn't the benchmark for ""% right picks"" be above 50%? We've been in an insane Bull market for a while now, anyone can guess a fortune 500 company and have a pretty good chance of making money. 

500%+ daily returns is pretty insane but that's just Cramer pumping and dumping boomers.

If you asked me he's doing just as good as anyone on his longs and that's because wallstreet is a casino and he isn't the house as much as any of us."
2021-04-18 14:37:41,wallstreetbets,I would recommend looking at REGI. THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE TERRIFIC.  THIS IS 4x stock.
2021-04-18 14:38:27,wallstreetbets,He's gonna fucking love this post won't he. Of course the things he pick goes up the day after. Bullshit that this isn't considered market manipulation but DFV gets into problems. Also Cramer can easily be bought by the HFs. Duck this guy.
2021-04-18 14:40:00,wallstreetbets,"Cranmer is the original pump and dump pusher.

All stocks successful are memes."
2021-04-18 14:40:13,wallstreetbets,"Great analysis but what the fuck is ""till date""?!  That's not even a thing."
2021-04-18 14:42:38,wallstreetbets,Slightly false premise to say the baseline is 50% chance of going up when picked at random since we are in a 12 year bull
2021-04-18 14:43:30,wallstreetbets,"Random walk theory does not apply to S&P 500 data on any time scale.

You will get bias to increasing numbers at about the 7% annualized rate.

If you don't care about that rate, or you compensate for it, it applies, but otherwise, it doesn't follow random walk. The next day is not a 50/50."
2021-04-18 14:46:50,wallstreetbets,This just seems like pump and dump. One day returns mean nothing.
2021-04-18 14:46:57,wallstreetbets,Only way to go lambo is to Hold
2021-04-18 14:48:07,wallstreetbets,"This one-day return is kinda pointless since it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. Enough people listen to what he says and buys to move the market, even if by a small amount.

Instead of doing the average return, you should do the median return. Since unless you listen to everything he recommends and buys it all, you won't get the average return. But the median return gives you a better idea if you buy a random pick he made.

The fact he's made +700 calls this year and we're in a bull market (an amazingly bull market), doesn't really surprise me that it's up. Really you should compare his picks to the S&P500. It's easy to make money, but it's not so easy to beat the market. Also, it's hard to see if the trends hold."
2021-04-18 14:48:11,wallstreetbets,"Why are you showing cumulative returns (I assume the sum of all stock movements), rather than an average effect over the time period."
2021-04-18 14:51:23,wallstreetbets,"I don’t hate the guy, but one thing I never liked about Cramer was how big of a hypocrite he can be when he talks about certain stocks. He can loath them, caress them, talk about how golden they are. Then give it a week and he trashes on them and kicks them to them to the curb"
2021-04-18 14:51:30,wallstreetbets,"He's on his side, seems to me day traders and fund analysts stand to benefit the most from his performance."
2021-04-18 14:52:10,wallstreetbets,"I feel like 2020 was such an insane year for stocks across all spectrums, so I can’t really buy too much into this. I would love to see more years though"
2021-04-18 14:53:20,wallstreetbets,There is no way to tell if the movement would have been the same without his recommendation.
2021-04-18 14:54:04,wallstreetbets,This does sort of read as a Cramer recommendation on it's own is market manipulation.  Especially since they are only good investments for the day he recommended them.
2021-04-18 14:55:12,wallstreetbets,"This actually made me want to start listening to Cramer, with all the doubts from everyone, I haven’t. But I don’t have much money right now, and I’m not a complete moron, so you don’t gotta worry about me buying his recommendations. I don’t have regular cable, how do I watch his show?"
2021-04-18 15:02:42,wallstreetbets,"It doesn’t surprise me that these are the results given the following that Cramer has.  However, I would opine that he already has a position in everything he recommends on his show, probably closing that position the next morning in pre-market during the buying frenzy as his followers all jump in."
2021-04-18 15:03:16,wallstreetbets,"Great DD. Conclusion: Cramer creates more bag holders than anyone else.

Intentionally or not, one thing is for sure: if anyone else had a record like that they wouldn't be on TV for very long. Some HF must have their hand up his rear end that makes him squawk when they need to liquidate."
2021-04-18 15:07:43,wallstreetbets,">Benchmark being 50% since anyone can pick a random stock and the probability of the stock going up is 50%

lol.  No.  Most stocks go up.  Especially the types of companies that Cramer recommends.  Its not 50/50.  The benchmark is typically the S&P500.  That is what you need to beat in order to be ""successful"".

Otherwise, what this says is that Cramer is a hype machine.  The dude mentions a stock on his show and it skyrockets the next day."
2021-04-18 15:09:11,wallstreetbets,The fact that these picks go red after a.month only proves that Cramer is good at pumping and dumping stocks.
2021-04-18 15:10:09,wallstreetbets,"I remember tracking his recommendations years ago to see how they did a couple of months later and concluded that I might as well flip a coin.

Anyone with a big following can make stocks they recommend go up almost immediately, why do you think ARK shows their daily trades? They say it's to be transparent. I say it's to pump those stocks.

Even random traders on Twitter can pump certain stocks just by mentioning it if they have a big enough following.  

Also keep in mind that over the past few months, the market has been sky rocketing, even crap penny stocks have gone insane.

He gives out so many recommendations that it's basically like those trading gurus. Recommend a bunch of stocks and brag about the ones that actually go up and never talk about the ones that went down."
2021-04-18 15:10:56,wallstreetbets,"Yes, this is called a pump and dump."
2021-04-18 15:12:16,wallstreetbets,Cramers ugly wife doodled this obviously
2021-04-18 15:14:34,wallstreetbets,Where do people follow his recommendations?   Twitter?   I find his videos too annoying you watch is there a summary somewhere of daily recommendations?
2021-04-18 15:14:53,wallstreetbets,Found Cramer’s burner account
2021-04-18 15:15:01,wallstreetbets,"Millions of viewers react to what he’s says.  That’s not the same as being a good stock forecaster. Besides that, I despise the corporate media. I don’t even watch tv anymore."
2021-04-18 15:17:51,wallstreetbets,One day returns? That's not investing lmao
2021-04-18 15:23:21,wallstreetbets,"Well well well, look who's an expert at paperhanding. Figures."
2021-04-18 15:23:35,wallstreetbets,It’s easy to influence the price of a stock when you have a large audience of people trading on your recommendation. The better analysis would be to compare his buy/sell recommendations to the trading activity of his charitable trust that he is always talking about. If he recommended something as a buy and it shot up 500% the next day was his trust selling at a huge profit? Also if he recommended something as a sell and it dumped 80% the next day was he then swooping in and buying cheap?
2021-04-18 15:24:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeahhhhh I have always wondered how his show is not seen as illegal since it 100% influences investing patterns. People call in and say ""I bought this because you said to"" etc. But somehow talking about stocks on reddit was cause for a hearing?"
2021-04-18 15:26:20,wallstreetbets,Someone create a bot
2021-04-18 15:27:54,wallstreetbets,That was something different lol
2021-04-18 15:29:39,wallstreetbets,Nice analysis! What the hell is “Till Date” though? Hold until a specific date??
2021-04-18 15:31:19,wallstreetbets,The benchmark isn’t 50% in a bull market stocks will go up more often than down. To create an actual benchmark you need to look at what the entire market did in that period did 50% of the stocks go up or 75% of them? If it’s greater than Cramers percentage of right picks then he may have made money but he is still a donut who just got lucky
2021-04-18 15:31:48,wallstreetbets,that to me sounds like market manipulation
2021-04-18 15:33:11,wallstreetbets,The one way this is flawed is we are in a massive bull market. If a literal ape threw shit at a chart he would probably have similar results
2021-04-18 15:42:59,wallstreetbets,This analysis doesn't say anything. One day returns in any random selectoon in a bull market woild have gone up. The 4 month returns again mean nothing in a bull market because all stocks have gone up. What is the alpha of his selectoon ie excess return over bench mark?
2021-04-18 15:44:52,wallstreetbets,Anybody trying to glean a trend from the last year bull market doesn’t really understand statistics.
2021-04-18 15:45:15,wallstreetbets,"So I understand your analysis, are you measuring buying it the day of his show, and then selling it the next day?"
2021-04-18 15:46:56,wallstreetbets,All this is just noise.  You have to really search and try to find solid stock at a discount.  In the end I feel like I’m just gambling my money.    I’m looking at RECAF now.   Betting all on 7 at the roulette table lol 😂🥴🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
2021-04-18 15:48:59,wallstreetbets,"What about his, ""don't"" statistics?"
2021-04-18 15:50:19,wallstreetbets,I paper traded Cramers bullish picks in a 3 month window. Bet 3 I lost all my paper.
2021-04-18 15:55:16,wallstreetbets,"""Invest in everything"""
2021-04-18 15:56:21,wallstreetbets,What this really shows is that he’s a pump and dumper
2021-04-18 15:58:14,wallstreetbets,He's right in the short term because people buy on his recommendations.
2021-04-18 16:02:35,wallstreetbets,"under your limitations, you should have also said that the market is impacted by his recommendations."
2021-04-18 16:08:18,wallstreetbets,"I mean yeah his one day returns are like a pump n dump, but returns till date of 446% are still pretty nice, isnt it?"
2021-04-18 16:09:10,wallstreetbets,How exactly does one have less than -100% returns on a buy recommendation?
2021-04-18 16:09:27,wallstreetbets,Was Bear Stearns on the list? Cant seem to find it.
2021-04-18 16:11:26,wallstreetbets,One day returns=self fulfilling prophecy
2021-04-18 16:13:11,wallstreetbets,Thanks for all the work. But FUCK CRAMER. If that fool was on fire i wouldnt pee on him to help him. That POS is one of them. He wont help us hes there to talk shit about stocks the HFs are shorting.
2021-04-18 16:13:38,wallstreetbets,"His long terms buys have gone up
His long term sales have gone down.

On the large sample size This clearly just shows the markets been gradually going up in general rather than any clever picks"
2021-04-18 16:20:18,wallstreetbets,Ok so his calls last one day. So that means buy JMIA Monday. He said he didn’t like it and you should dump it on Friday. It dropped $2. Calls on Monday morning will print based on this analysis.
2021-04-18 16:23:32,wallstreetbets,"\>No matter how we feel about Cramer, the one-day returns on both his buy and sell recommendations have been phenomenal.

a big part of it has to be the fact that he says it on air, and people react to it."
2021-04-18 16:26:50,wallstreetbets,oh nice. Thanks for the check boss. Always wondered.
2021-04-18 16:29:44,wallstreetbets,"Title should have just been, ""I anal-ized Cramer"".

Instant upvote to front page."
2021-04-18 16:31:14,wallstreetbets,"By having a large audience, all of your buy and sell recommendations should be self fulfilling.


You recommend, audience buy, price goes up.


To really test something like this you would have to have predictions in a vacuum/unknown without influence.


Basically we should all watch Jim Cramer every day, speedclick the buybutton on recommendations and sell at a profit predetermined. 


Sounds like a plan? %)"
2021-04-18 16:34:09,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the amount of effort put in here, but judging someone’s picks on this short of a time horizon tells you practically nothing"
2021-04-18 16:35:49,wallstreetbets,"Why would you assume that there's a 50/50 chance a stock goes up or down? Historically, stocks are much more likely to increase 

Also the fact that his one day returns are orders of magnitude better than his one month returns shows that either these stocks were already strongly trending in that direction leading to his call, or his recommendation leads to a stock being pumped/dumped, but it corrects itself

It actually seems like the best strategy is waiting a couple days and then doing the opposite of what he suggests"
2021-04-18 16:36:48,wallstreetbets,"So, he is basically great but generates pump and dumps by himself?"
2021-04-18 16:37:48,wallstreetbets,"Boomers and almost boomers listen to cramer religiously. Obviously next day results reflect that. Try doing the same thing for the first year his show aired, when he wasn't popular yet."
2021-04-18 16:40:47,wallstreetbets,I don't watch Cramer and therefore don't heed his advise but wasn't he accused of pumping up some stocks so he made money on them a few years back. He has no credibility with me.
2021-04-18 16:45:29,wallstreetbets,"So buy that day, sell the next, and use the profits to short for 1 mo, then buy again?"
2021-04-18 16:49:06,wallstreetbets,All you managed to prove is a phenomenon well-known as a CNBC effect.
2021-04-18 16:50:49,wallstreetbets,"Interesting. 

Question? Given the average return is 0.9% would the commission and more importantly the spread negate a lot of the 500% plus gain given the small average gain?"
2021-04-18 16:51:49,wallstreetbets,"I'm missing something here: how can the return be -223%? Even if his picks went to 0, wouldn't the return be at worst -100%? Or are you adding up the returns from all picks?"
2021-04-18 16:57:51,wallstreetbets,Your analysis assumes you can buy at the closing price the day BEFORE he recommended it which makes your analysts basically retarded.
2021-04-18 16:58:25,wallstreetbets,You need to apply the discount rate across different time periods to get a more objective view.
2021-04-18 17:00:01,wallstreetbets,But did you analyze BIGG Digital Assets? That is the real question.
2021-04-18 17:00:34,wallstreetbets,"Garbage ass post, nothing but shit we already knew that he was a p&d ad with a much larger audience just like all the YouTube channels who do the same crap with penny stocks."
2021-04-18 17:09:43,wallstreetbets,I read this post and all I heard was buy the dip.
2021-04-18 17:13:27,wallstreetbets,"These recommendations happen at a point in time during the day, was that the starting price you used, or did Jim jump onto hit stocks mid-day?"
2021-04-18 17:14:06,wallstreetbets,Isn't the fact that even short term (i.e. one month) the return is very negative just evidence that the one day returns are p & d
2021-04-18 17:16:15,wallstreetbets,Groovy!
2021-04-18 17:17:54,wallstreetbets,Could you run a similar analysis over the same time period but choosing stocks at random?
2021-04-18 17:24:50,wallstreetbets,So what I got out of this is buy in the morning on his recommendation and sell before end of day
2021-04-18 17:26:57,wallstreetbets,His sell recommendations are right because people panic sell when he says sell!
2021-04-18 17:29:31,wallstreetbets,It's not that he's right for a one day returns --- he has a fucking TV show. He's making the stock go up by people trading his recommendations.
2021-04-18 17:30:37,wallstreetbets,TLDR: sell the hype
2021-04-18 17:35:44,wallstreetbets,"If we apply your logic, you’re saying that if I buy three stocks for 1 000 dollars each, they all fall 50%, my cumulative loss is 3*50% = 150%, or 4 590 dollars. On a 3 000 dollar investment which is worth 1 500 dollars. 

And you see no problem with this?"
2021-04-18 17:35:57,wallstreetbets,I still want to punch him in the weiner
2021-04-18 17:40:05,wallstreetbets,I wish you would have started by calculating whether or not anyone would care about his opinion. Might have saved you a lot of time. But great work otherwise!
2021-04-18 17:42:03,wallstreetbets,Boomer Jim Cramer ETF symbol: JCPD
2021-04-18 17:43:45,wallstreetbets,How bout no!
2021-04-18 17:48:41,wallstreetbets,"Hard to tell whats organic tho... If a guy on tv with 500k viewers says buy this or sell this and lets say even 20% actually did what he said of course the next day trades would reflect that. Lets see how those stocks do in 5 years, 10 years, 20 years then come back to me."
2021-04-18 17:50:39,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for putting this together. A very important correction that needs to be made is that the 1-day return is not 555%, but rather 0.90%, as per your spreadsheet. This is how much people would have made if they bought in all recommendations at close price (which is not possible). The best strategy is most certainly to short all the stocks at the next closing for the -0.51% in a month (not -223%). It doesn't seem that interesting tbh."
2021-04-18 17:52:39,wallstreetbets,this is in a year when 99% of stocks are up. kind of hard to go wrong? lol
2021-04-18 17:55:52,wallstreetbets,"Define ""next day.""

Does this mean buy AFTERHOURS when he makes the picks? (6pm EST)

Or does it mean buy the next market day?"
2021-04-18 17:56:55,wallstreetbets,How did you calculate a -223% loss?
2021-04-18 18:03:10,wallstreetbets,"So, he’s basically MANIPULATING stock prices."
2021-04-18 18:05:22,wallstreetbets,"Ever wondered why Cramer is more successful short term?
Because he is telling you to buy stocks which his institutional buddies bought sometime ago. And would be selling soon. 
Remember cnbc doesnt and can not get as much money from you as a viewer as he can can get from institutional friends."
2021-04-18 18:07:39,wallstreetbets,"Not sure anyone has mentioned this yet, but the ""cumulative return"" calculation appears to be wrong  u/nobjos. The time period of investing in each stock overlaps with the other stocks that were mentioned that day (they are parallel investments), but the cumulative return calculation assumes that they are serial investments on different days. Thanks for the analysis though, the 24hr turnaround would still make a ton of money, just not 500% in 3.5 months...more like around 80% (just take the number of days the market has been open this year and multiply by 0.9%)."
2021-04-18 18:09:42,wallstreetbets,He pumped and dumped MP and now my shit is all fucked up.
2021-04-18 18:14:39,wallstreetbets,"Once shitadel/insider information goes away, what will be his results?"
2021-04-18 18:21:21,wallstreetbets,"It's also been a good year. Pick 651 random stocks and plot the same odds as a base line then we will talk. Seriously I asked once and I'm asking again because this DD is shit with out a base line comparison market.

Aslo, It's a self filling prophecy of playing the odds as He recommended so many stocks and has enough followers maybe enough to manipulate the market in his favor.

BTW no need to keep pumping and dumping your shit DD. This was posted under r/options and it was shit then and it is shit now. Don't buy into Cramer's pump and dump to make him rich."
2021-04-18 18:21:28,wallstreetbets,Removed by user.
2021-04-18 18:22:25,wallstreetbets,I pretty much do the opposite every time he says something.  He often changes what he previously said before.  He was telling people to buy amazon after there last earnings when it was in the 3400’s those people are still down.  He was telling people DOCU was a post Covid winner at the end of 2020 and now he said it’s too hot when it was hotter before on a buy.  His 500 ticker and above club tanked hard immediately.  He was recommending SNOW at 300 but says it needs to come down now.  The thing that drives me nuts is that he switches around what he says all the time. He hates PLTR but has loved CRM and SNOW.  Think about all the high flying spacs he reccommended and now is basically against all spacs. NGA XL RMO CCIV.
2021-04-18 18:24:36,wallstreetbets,It's like Elon Musk with a television show if he wanted to give financial advice!
2021-04-18 18:25:14,wallstreetbets,"> No matter how we feel about Cramer, the one-day returns on both his buy and sell recommendations have been phenomenal. 

Or, to put it differently, his pump&dump schemes work phenomenal. How do you distinguish panic sales _caused_ by his recommendations from what the stock would have done without his recommendation for example? This is not science."
2021-04-18 18:27:54,wallstreetbets,"So is this based on the price right before the show or the close price the day before.  And again the one day price at what point are you taking the price, one day after the show or the price point at opening next day?"
2021-04-18 18:29:15,wallstreetbets,Maybe pick a time when the whole market wasn’t just going up.
2021-04-18 18:29:21,wallstreetbets,"**Cramer made a total of 651 buy recommendations over the course of the past 4 months. If you had invested in every single stock, he recommended and then pulled out the next day, the returns were a staggering 555%**

This of course simply means that he and his group front run and the gullible (lazy/sheep whatever you want to call it) viewers that buy  the ""I don't want to make friends I want to make YOU money stick.""  All that legal disclaimer stuff at the bottom of the screen, you know.

Disclaimer:  I haven't watched Ol  Jimbo  in years but a quick Google search of all the talking heads on CNBC can be quite the eye opener if you've never taken the time to do it you should.

Edit:  BTW Cramer isn't the first, he is just the latest in a long line of financial hucksters.  Google some old school classics like Dan Dorfman from USA today or R Foster Winans from the Wall Street Journal. Maria Bartiromo (the money honey) was married to Johnathon Steinberg, son of Saul Steinberg.  Yes THAT Saul Steinberg.   Saul was a bigtime ""greenmail"" corporate raider in the 80's.  Herb Greenberg used to work for a bigtime ""short"" boutique.  It goes on and on."

2021-04-18 18:41:00,wallstreetbets,Would be curious to see this analysis over other time periods (pre-2020). I’m not really impressed with calls made this year since the entire market is going up...
2021-04-18 18:41:27,wallstreetbets,The best strategy seems to buy Puts one month out on Kramer’s picks.
2021-04-18 18:41:36,wallstreetbets,One day returns are phenomenal. Basically a boomer pump and dump.
2021-04-18 18:42:15,wallstreetbets,Majority of his recommendations are BUY and we are in an insane bull market that lasted a decade. Not really a fair benchmark to compare it to a 50/50 coin toss.
2021-04-18 18:45:38,wallstreetbets,"“(Benchmark being 50% since anyone can pick a random stock and the probability of the stock going up is 50%).”

Gotta disagree with you there. Just because it can go up or down doesn’t mean the odds are an even 50%. Earnings reports, bankruptcy announcements, media hype, all could greatly influence one way or the other.

Besides, you forgot the stock could go sideways. So if we’re talking solely about direction odds, would it not have to be 1/3 1/3 1/3?"
2021-04-18 18:45:46,wallstreetbets,"I think this article (and the game theory concept of common knowledge) - https://www.epsilontheory.com/sheep-logic/

2021-04-18 19:41:56,wallstreetbets,"you have to provide some control to this analysis, like comparing the data against the overall performance of the market sector he's making guesses about, and what the stock was doing the moment he made the call, and since the 24 hour period is what you're looking at primarily, the 24 hour period before he made his call. my guess is he's picking stocks towards the end of an upswing in both 1. their market sector and 2. the stock itself. Like, it's pretty easy to pick a pharma company that just beat earnings during a market-wide pharma run. the issue is, as others here are pointing out, is when to time an exit on his pump-and-dumpedness."
2021-04-18 19:42:21,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer wears compression socks on his head.
2021-04-18 19:43:35,wallstreetbets,"This is awesome.  A few questions:

1.  What is ""till date""?  Is that just the returns until now?  What if he recommends a buy and a few months later recommends a sell?

2.  I assume that all the returns are annualized?

3.  Since his show comes on after the regular market close, 
but before the AH session.. what price do you assume that the stocks were bought/sold at?  The closing price on the day of his show seems unreasonable (because that's no longer available).  A more reasonable price might be the next trading day's open (which anyone can get with a MOO order), although then you might miss the P&D gains.  Buying AH is possible although poor liquidity makes it hard to figure out what price someone would have gotten.

4.  Do you ignore picks where he says to buy if you can get in under a certain price (I think he did that for Snowflake when they came public) or where he says to buy ""only if it comes down""?

This is seriously great analysis; thanks for doing it."

Now ask yourself how this would work for someone new? Those losses are someone paper handing in a month. Because they didn’t sell the next day, or they thought a longer hold wasn’t going to profit. 

I would love to see what that looks like in dollars generated from the short and the long plays. 

It’s easy to jump on into they hype, but by the time it’s hyped up, day traders are already in and out."

2021-04-18 16:38:51,wallstreetbets,Next day increases are the Cramer effect which is well documented. Folks with zero knowledge watch Cramer buy his picks next day. What your analysis does show is record Cramer’s picks wait a month for the excitement to die down and buy his picks....
2021-04-18 13:46:48,wallstreetbets,That's what this sub is becoming too. Or maybe it was always like this. Not 100% sure.

2021-04-18 15:56:01,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the analysis, but I would love a longer term view. I been around to know how Cramer works and without any stats, I am confident you would have lost more money than you made if you followed his recommendations. His one day returns are because people dive in (or out) the moment he makes a recommendation.  That is why I find that one month performance interesting because it means that by then, folks get out from the hype and actually lose money. Also, Cramer has “winners” by recommending the obvious. Yeah, Tesla, Amazon, Apple etc. when they been going on an uptrend. Where was he when GME was at $3. What was he saying when the market was crashing last year? Did he say to buy before or much after the market bottomed out. Heck, he should credit WSB since many of his good recommendations are coming from you beautiful people, but he fails to give that credit. 

TL;DR: Cramer sucks. You get better DD and advice in WSB or by yourself."
2021-04-18 16:41:11,wallstreetbets,How is this even legal and still on air?
2021-04-18 17:38:54,wallstreetbets,"That was my thoughts exactly. Surely a lot of people watch the show, so his recommendations, if followed by enough people, may end up increasing or decreasing the stock. 

Which could trigger people who don't watch, but see the trendlines, to make choices too. 

So yea, a sort of pump and dump ad lol."
2021-04-18 19:13:22,wallstreetbets,How is this not stock manipulation?
2021-04-18 18:33:34,wallstreetbets,Correct. He is a scumbag. Hedge funds love him on the sell position. Anyone buying a stock because of Kramer should drink bleach and donate their money.

2021-04-18 11:49:43,wallstreetbets,I think the difference is that Cramer is an on air financial advisor supported by a massive company; DFV is not. I agree with the part that DFV shouldn’t be sued though.

2021-04-18 12:59:57,wallstreetbets,I was going to say of course his one day buys go well. It’s a pump and dump. I’d be curious to see this say data day by day for the next 7 to 10 days.

2021-04-18 18:59:02,wallstreetbets,"The method is poor, but you are also wrong. Stocks aren't down by over 100%, cumulative gain percentages are. If you buy 10 sideways stocks, you have 0% gain. If each goes down by 50%, you've lost 50% of your total investment but the cumulative negative gain percentage is 500%. If one goes up 50% and the rest go down 50%, it's - 450%.

 It's definitely a weird way to measure it, but it also makes sense since each stock won't have the same price. 1% of 100 is a lot more than 1% of 1. So it would be a lot different if that was measured. 10% ROI on a $1 stock is not the same as 10% ROI on a $100 stock. Basically, you can't meaningfully add percentages like OP does and convert it to ROI."

2021-04-18 12:28:57,wallstreetbets,I can tell you for sure my company and all companies on mad money/the street do this.  And it always works.  Which is why they all do it.  I’m not totally sure there is anything illegal about that.  But I’m just a dumb 🦍
2021-04-18 15:43:10,wallstreetbets,How do any of you know that DFV was not paid to pump his dick to GameStop for months and months to create a frenzy? The Cramer hate here is retarded.
2021-04-18 14:20:00,wallstreetbets,Nah man they just advertise on his show for marketing specific purposes and has nothing to do with him boosting their stocks.
2021-04-18 11:56:22,wallstreetbets,"Ya, if u r holding a stock and he says buy, you sell the next day. He's basically a 24 hr pump guy. 

You need to buy at the moment he says buy and sell the next day. Buy a few minutes too late and sp already moved."

2021-04-18 14:20:44,wallstreetbets,Just short everything he says and hold for a month. You get in on the high and ride the tide low.

He makes recommendations at 6pm, so you should look at the day after, since the market is closed for retail investors."
2021-04-18 17:27:03,wallstreetbets,"Buy the next morning at open and sell by close. Either blindly buy all picks or use analysis to filter by highest probability. 

Buy puts set to expire in 1 month. Buy more shares at 1 month. 

Swing or position trade after that. 

If you played his picks that way every day/week/month, you’d probably average 10% per week. That’s a ***very*** rough estimate. 

Easier play is to short his buy picks and exit at 1 month. Not sure what the gains would be there. I don’t short stock. I’ll place bets a stock price will drop, but shorting is literally an attempt to *force* it down. It’s beyond fucked. Might as well kneecap the front desk receptionist."

2021-04-18 16:45:12,wallstreetbets,That doesn't mean that the people that pay him for the show aren't investing in those stocks. Or the hedge funds that know those people.
2021-04-18 12:18:19,wallstreetbets,"He stated what he was buying, disclosed his position, and presented DD and a strongly worded encouragement to DYOR. He and a thousand other YouTube stock channels are doing nothing different from one another. If he'd lost his investment, no one would be calling for him to be sued.

If someone says: ""Buy this stock. It's GOING to go UP."" That's misleading. If someone says, ""I bought this stock because, based on the information here, I believe it's going to go up,"" and you copy their investment, it might create a feedback loop, or it might not. If you think DFV manipulated the stock with his paltry 100k shares, versus the billions that were leveraged against the stock going up, you haven't been paying attention."

2021-04-18 13:29:15,wallstreetbets,Maybe a 5 day short on his buy calls. This would work.

2021-04-18 15:41:03,wallstreetbets,Your method is worthless.
2021-04-18 16:47:45,wallstreetbets,You should do an additional research based on his alertplus picks.

2021-04-18 11:51:35,wallstreetbets,"The random walk theory, does not actually apply to real world stock data though.

Take for instance the averages on the s&p 500:

The percentage of stock market days up from ‘96 – 2016 was 53.29%. The percentage of stock market days down was 46.71%.

So with using that data set you would see a 7ish percent return through any sort of random picking of stock.

I assume Kramer's pics are heavily weighted in s&p 500 stocks."
2021-04-18 11:58:10,wallstreetbets,"I'll be back after I pretend to research and think about this more.

2021-04-18 16:08:20,wallstreetbets,FOMO and pump and dump go hand in hand imo. The best way to dump is to when the price starts eeking out it’s potential you make everyone else think it’s only like halfway there. Then sell off as it rises a little more til some other catch on and break the rise because they dump fast and hard. Idk that’s how merchant clans did it back in the day on RuneScape and that’s where I attended university at sooo don’t listen to my retarded ass I’m just here for the frosties.

2021-04-18 16:43:33,wallstreetbets,"Or do nothing the day he says buy a stock. Then after the stock jumps on price, buy puts against it. Sell to close the puts, at a profit, after the stock drops again."
2021-04-18 13:07:48,wallstreetbets,"Except the graphs OP posted shows it wasn’t just 24 hour holds that were profitable.

Edit: apparently, however, OP just added up the percentages of the 600+ stocks, instead of writing the averages in the post"
2021-04-18 13:11:02,wallstreetbets,"But you have to have the stock first. What are the odds you're just minding your business holding a stock he says to sell, and you're paying attention to him every day until your one stock gets mentioned?

I think the point is that you need to know which to buy before taking advice on selling."
2021-04-18 17:20:33,wallstreetbets,"Cramer’s show airs after market close. You ain’t buying shit the minute he says “buy”. 

His picks are up ***by close of market the next day***. That means you could buy at open and sell by close and be up 54% of the time. 600+ picks with a 54% win rate and 555% cumulative gain comes around to around 1.5% per win. If you just buy whatever he says to buy, you’re looking at 0.8% average per stock. There’s no “minutes too late”. 

49% of picks are still up 1 week later. They don’t dip until after that. 1 month later everything is negative. However, ***50%+ of his picks have made a cumulative gain of 400%+ year to date***. That means long holds will keep gaining. 

Literally the opposite of a 24 hour pump guy. Nobody should ever listen to you about anything because you can’t fucking read."

2021-04-18 17:22:28,wallstreetbets,"Market manipulation requires some element of deceit. If he lies about what he’s doing or fails to disclose that he’s being paid to promote certain stocks (if he is) that’s manipulation. If he simply says “I like the stock”, it’s not.

Bruh. It’s taxed as income. Your logic and everyone else saying they don’t wanna make more money because you pay more in taxes is not retarded. It’s just plain dumb. The only way you pay more in taxes is (here’s the kicker) IF YOU ARE MAKING MONEY and you wouldn’t ever pay more in taxes than the highest income tax rate so 37% (under normal conditions not talking about wash sales and other goofy shit that is preventable). And again, short term gains are taxed as income. So let’s call apples apples. Short term gains and income from a job are equal (aside from one having taxes taken out throughout the year) so based on that logic would you also refuse a raise from your employer with the excuse BuT tHeN iLl PaY mOrE iN tAxEs!!! No. You wouldn’t refuse that raise. So get that garbage illogical excuse out of here, especially at WallStreetBETS of all places."

There's sentiment that DFV is guilty of the same thing, but there's no ""DFV Effect"" (or at least there wasn't when all of this started; there almost certainly will be now, and he'll need to tread lightly in how he handles his channel going forward). But if Cramer was in charge of his positions, and knowingly pumped one of them only to sell, he'd be looking at an SEC investigation for sure."

2021-04-18 14:41:48,wallstreetbets,Except only if you can get them at the previous day price. The pop is from previous day close to next day close. If the stock opens way up you could lose a bunch of money and Cramer would still be credited with a win by this metric.

Random Walk theory doesn't say that stocks go up 50% of the time. Random walk theory says today's movement cannot be predicted(or guessed in a financially benefitial way) based on yesterday's performance. There are obvious caveats(such as volatility clustering) but the foundations of random walk theory absolutely do apply."
2021-04-18 17:10:49,wallstreetbets,"Except Cramer is not chosing a day, he's choosing a stock. So I think the benchmark should be whether Cramer's pick performed better or worse than the market over the same time period. Especially if our period is longer than a day."
2021-04-18 17:19:31,wallstreetbets,"Agree with this. Also, timing of the overall macro economic fluctuations probably has more to do with buying any stock. For example, majority of stocks went up between 2002 and 2008, or 20010 and 2019, or March 2020 until now, so it's not really a 50/50 up or down, it's that majority of s&p500 stocks went up if they were recommended during those times, and majority of stocks went down when recommended during an overall market correction. 

The true analysis would be to narrow the recommendations down to just those in the s&p500, and of all 500 hundred stocks on any given day, did the one Cramer recommended go higher of lower than the s&p500 average over the next day/month/year?"

If I work-extra and get paid more, you pay marginal taxes on that extra money and you are still well-off.

Trading -- You have good years and bad years.

Let's say you make +$50,000 one year and -$40,000 the next year. You should be up +$10,000, right?

No.

The Year you made $50,000, you only make $30,000 and the year you lose $40,000 (you only get to write off $3000 of taxes owed from some other income), let's give you the benefit of the doubt and you take advantage of $3000 tax write off, So you only lost $37,000

But, net-net you still are -$7000 from these two years.

OTOH, if you a buy-and-hold S&P, you are ahead by $10,000.

Taxes absolutely matters in trading. So, you have to make up for the $17,000 difference with your skill. But, 99.99% don't beat the market"

If you make more money you'll be taxed on more money. Pretty sure that's how percentages work, not to mention what happens when that raise bumps you into a higher tax bracket.

I agree with what you're saying though, I just found it ironically funny that you say earning a higher income won't mean higher taxes."
2021-04-18 13:31:12,wallstreetbets,"You can't determine what is and isn't manipulation of a security just by the success one has after talking about it. 

Dfv bought months ago. As in, when it was worth less than $10. Back then he didn't have the subscribers he did now, and even if he did, nobody believed him because it took until January for people to start buying gamestonk. Hell, I'd argue most of the 10 million people on this sub haven't watched a single one of his youtube videos (for reference, I  haven't) and for that fact, this sub only had somewhere around 3 million users before January. 

The only difference between what dfv has done and the DDs that get posted here on a daily basis is that dfv got it right. 

If I posted a DD on ASO before it's earnings report and it's rise to $30, would that have been manipulation? See where the fallacy lives now?"

At the time when DFV/RoaringKitty was establishing his positions, he was doing so on his own, and posting his YOLOs for what they were: Here's what *I'm* doing with *my* money. Let's see what happens.

He wasn't working with insider information, he was working with the information he'd gathered from chart-watching. Go look at his socialblade to watch the user-follow trend from April 2020 when his investment began until January 2021 when it exploded. He was unknown outside of his niche communities. He had less than 20k subs until December of 2020, long after securing the vast majority of his positions. There *was* no ""DFV Effect."" 

That said, if he did the same thing tomorrow, I might be inclined to completely agree with you. But I just can't by looking what's happening now versus when DFV began placing his positions."

It isn't really the past performance that is dictating future movement. It's the fact that you have underlying companies that are growing at a steady pace.

The S and P 500 is also not a zero-sum game. You don't have to have a loser to have a winner. If you don't even have to have money going into the system in order to have an increase in growth, or vice versa.

Anyway you cut it on average, you are going to get about a 7% upward return on the S&P 500. It is not a 50/50 on the day. This has been true for its history. There's basically no way at this point you could balance its statistics. If it were to average out in a 50/50, it would take an incredible amount of data contrary to its history.

2021-04-18 12:48:54,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations, can't be mad at that.  All shares tho?"
2021-04-18 17:05:53,wallstreetbets,BB will jump sooner than later.  ADT should also be jumping.  Google purchased 6% of ADT and will roll out NEST / ADT products very soon.

2021-04-18 17:32:00,wallstreetbets,What catalyst does BB have? I should probably not be a lazy fuck and research.
2021-04-18 18:22:03,wallstreetbets,I bought a bunch of BB $11 6/18 calls and my arms are getting heavy. Clicked for some confirmation bias but found only confusion. =/

2021-04-18 15:37:46,wallstreetbets,21% diversity?  That's retarded.

2021-04-18 16:59:45,wallstreetbets,Take this from a financial Analyst but whenever u see green in your portfolio it means you are not doing good
2021-04-18 17:20:55,wallstreetbets,Well that’s fucking impressive.
2021-04-18 17:30:59,wallstreetbets,Blackberry is another one of those meme stocks that actually has a really good CEO. but still doesnt relate to this at all...

2021-04-18 17:35:38,wallstreetbets,Godspeed retard!
2021-04-18 17:36:43,wallstreetbets,No definitely not doing it right... definitely on the wrong forum... total return is definitely the wrong color...
2021-04-18 17:48:50,wallstreetbets,I see no connection between the screenshot and BB. It is about TSLA...
2021-04-18 18:18:18,wallstreetbets,I assume your phone is a blackberry?!

Now that the other two theater places closed for sure"
2021-04-18 19:02:00,wallstreetbets,Doing it right would have been to put some actual money in TESLA before it went up.
2021-04-18 19:02:13,wallstreetbets,I had tesla and bb did  me no justice
2021-04-18 19:03:37,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-18 19:04:50,wallstreetbets,Also I'm buy some condor options

2021-04-18 10:28:44,wallstreetbets,"Those certainly are impressive gains....

But do you ever kick yourself for not buying options? 

Imagine if you had placed a proper bet, on something that trades in an exchange, on Wall Street...  Then you could find a subreddit of like minded individuals and share it with them!

That would be cool.

2021-04-18 13:10:52,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is the next Tesla.

Enjoy throwing your money at BB though I suppose. You done good til now, but comparing the product roadmap of BB and Tesla makes me question your sanity."
2021-04-18 13:04:21,wallstreetbets,I'm down on the $BB let's go. It's been a while since I've seen anyone make a call that doesn't seem like a repetitive bagholder trying to get out of their positions on WSB

2021-04-18 10:43:27,wallstreetbets,Lmao blackberry ain’t shit
2021-04-18 11:43:58,wallstreetbets,Blackberry is not the next tesla the fact alone that Nikola Tesla practically invented modern use of electricity and was never credited for it until now where his name belongs to the richest man on earth is no coincidence fate was destined to give Nikola Tesla his time in the sun I feel like it's only after the deed has been done you get the light while your in it you can't even tell your making history and that your going to be as big as you are(if you do indeed make it big)I think that goes for alot of people.
2021-04-18 19:04:22,wallstreetbets,Let's all just buy AMC and guarantee it's gonna make money this week. I'm buying 300 hundred shares in my 3 accounts each
2021-04-18 19:12:33,wallstreetbets,Blackberry needs to do more to change that phone image though. They really are taking hold with their new tech though. This stonk is seriously undervalued.
2021-04-18 14:53:54,wallstreetbets,Accurate
2021-04-18 18:51:59,wallstreetbets,Blackberry is the next Wendy’s
2021-04-18 12:04:52,wallstreetbets,"I think the OP is saying ""look at how much Tesla went up from the time I got in it"" and back door brag about the money made.

I dont know, just guessing.

Also, I am bullish on BB which is why I clicked this thread. Current position 1400 shares my PT 16$ before EOY."

I'm quite sure on this one."
2021-04-18 16:37:08,wallstreetbets,That's a very decent PPS. I've bought with some of my monthly alotted play money every dip and am just now getting under $10.
2021-04-18 10:34:26,wallstreetbets,"Thanks dude! I think BlackBerry really is the next Tesla. If it could trend here, on top of the new business model that’s transitioning to AI technology for self driving cars... that would be huge.

2021-04-18 14:58:45,wallstreetbets,That’s what I’m saying! It’s gonna pop anyways but if we can get it trending here as well then it’ll be something huge. Still gotta buy more shares myself 🤑
2021-04-18 13:20:02,wallstreetbets,Trying to average down too. Average purchase price for me is $12.59. Long term I think we’ll be super solid 👊

2021-04-18 15:09:14,wallstreetbets,Time to get your cost basis down? Get another 400 and you’ll be chillin in no time I’m sure
2021-04-18 13:08:23,wallstreetbets,"OP is most likely referring to the fact $BB is working on the AI for self driving cars and has a huge potential to benefit from current market speculation on Tesla as a self driving car company. And yes, sir, I am high as giraffe nips right now."

2021-04-18 17:15:05,wallstreetbets,Interesting! I’ll have to check out ADT a bit more
2021-04-18 13:44:37,wallstreetbets,I’m not sure I understand. Could you elaborate? WSB is for? And r/investing is for?
2021-04-18 13:49:22,wallstreetbets,Average purchase price?
2021-04-18 17:55:55,wallstreetbets,Do your research. You’ll see...
2021-04-18 11:56:40,wallstreetbets,In that case... I hope everyone thinks I’m super uncool & I get bullied by the world 🤑

2021-04-18 12:04:21,wallstreetbets,Exactly! Something ironic on that point is the company Nikola NKLA also makes cars. Poor Nikola Tesla is being used by capitalists. Think he’d care? Maybe his descendants will get a cut from both companies in the long term 🤷‍♂️
2021-04-18 11:52:26,wallstreetbets,I know that but I'm saying because Tesla the inventor never got his time to shine it is due now therefore the company Tesla is DESTINED to succeed assuming elon doesn't fuck it up.

2021-04-18 18:34:02,wallstreetbets,They think that they are still making cellphones and losing market share there 🙃
2021-04-18 18:16:24,wallstreetbets,"Well, I'm not a financial advisor, but here's my thoughts.

Their recent earnings didn't make the market go wow, but that was because (as they openly said) they were in the middle of selling some pieces of their massive patent portfolio that don't relate to their primary business focus. By the next quarter earning I would expect that to be completed, which will result in a massive cash influx and when that happens the market should react appropriately. Frankly, with all of the deals they've made over the past year I think a positive earnings report is all the catalyst that's needed for the stock to grow substantially (I hope to double)."
2021-04-18 11:37:19,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t be a bad decision. My average cost is $12 and I’m still not mad about it. Probably gonna buy a decent amount more before it hits $15.

2021-04-18 14:56:37,wallstreetbets,"You killed my father, prepare to die."
2021-04-18 13:14:44,wallstreetbets,Fuck you Estaban!
2021-04-18 16:56:56,wallstreetbets,Not too shabby
2021-04-18 19:20:49,wallstreetbets,It’s .74 for a 15c 1/21/22 now
2021-04-18 15:46:12,wallstreetbets,The $5 and $10 2023
2021-04-18 15:11:13,wallstreetbets,Lmaoooo
2021-04-18 15:04:39,wallstreetbets,"That makes sense. I also assumed investing even relatively long term, is also betting and that WSB was a place to show off large returns/losses. What’s the classification of a bet? How much? What time frame? How you gathered the money for the bet/investment? I’d like clarification on all of these"
2021-04-18 15:14:01,wallstreetbets,Not too bad
2021-04-18 18:18:01,wallstreetbets,Lemme know what you think
2021-04-18 15:20:16,wallstreetbets,🤨
2021-04-18 10:36:38,wallstreetbets,Ahhh nothing like a little envy. Appreciate the transparency lol. What’s your take on BlackBerry being the next GME or Tesla? I’ve been hearing it on cyber podcasts & seeing it floating around here
2021-04-18 15:02:44,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-18 14:17:11,wallstreetbets,I don't think the dude's mad. Pretty sure he's just a mod doing mod things.
2021-04-18 12:00:21,wallstreetbets,I agree; at the moment. I think many will be surprised in the future. Tesla hasn’t scaled as much as their actual value has. It’s the way of the world and the market now man.
2021-04-18 12:36:20,wallstreetbets,"wait , you mean you weren't comparing BB shares to Nikola Tesla but in fact were comparing Tesla the company and its gains? Now Im confused. Am I in the right sub?"
2021-04-18 12:06:55,wallstreetbets,"What about Nikola NKLA? They’re not doing so hot. In fact, I’m down like 40% on them. I also thought the name alone would inspire a spike in the price, but apparently it doesn’t. I think this disproves your theory."
2021-04-18 12:25:30,wallstreetbets,"The thing about him was that he was absolutely brilliant as an inventor, but absolute garbage as a businessman. He had people taking advantage of him from the start and never learned to control the path he was on. It's unfortunate and he deserved better, but it's not a shock."
2021-04-18 15:25:39,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-18 16:43:41,wallstreetbets,"I personally don’t with BB for the fact that I think they are extremely undervalued and oversold. If you’re okay with letting your shares go though then yes that is the way. I’m in for the long term, at least 3-5 years so I’m just sitting in this position. Once more money clears I will probably double down on my position"
2021-04-18 17:07:12,wallstreetbets,I do because I plan to hold mine for awhile. I don’t go too far out though. Just 2-3 weeks
2021-04-18 17:33:21,wallstreetbets,are you retarded or what? what dont you understand about that?
2021-04-18 12:40:21,wallstreetbets,Im in at $8.40 and Im buying more tomorrow morning. I also have a few September calls $10 strikes..
2021-04-18 12:32:47,wallstreetbets,"FYI, see my pinned post on my profile for why I am in there on BB with you."

2021-04-18 15:02:36,wallstreetbets,"If you truly believe blackberry is the next tesla, you would sell all your tesla and buy blackberry. Much longer runway than tesla for gains."
2021-04-18 12:36:26,wallstreetbets,Lol 42 :(
2021-04-18 18:20:50,wallstreetbets,You’d think OP would be balls deep in it telling everyone else to buy
2021-04-18 18:10:33,wallstreetbets,"That’s basically what Cuban suggested when he was here. Find a company we all believe in with a solid foundation and stick with it. Too many other distractions right now though. The reason GME worked is because everyone stayed focused and dedicated to it (of course paired with the shorting / squeeze). Imagine what could happen if we all got behind a company with solid fundamentals too. I’m a big believer in WWE for that reason. Their financials are solid and by utilizing their financials for analysis, it shows that it’s significantly undervalued. It has perfect meme momentum potential too to drive it and keep attention. I do think BB will probably move first though"
2021-04-18 18:19:48,wallstreetbets,"See, that’s where you outline your DD in short... 🤷‍♂️"

Buy and hold sun.dial and let me know how holding is ezpz and not at all a gamble. This sub is for putting in money and getting money out and posting your wins or losses. This guy won. You want options only? Try r/options"
2021-04-18 14:21:34,wallstreetbets,"He's a mod? And he's putting down a 14 bagger that required some serious diamond hands since TSLA was less than $50? Like damn, most people here have never even seen a gain of 4 digit %, stocks or options

What is this sub coming to"
2021-04-18 13:34:07,wallstreetbets,Umm... I’m not sure you are. BlackBerry BB is the next Tesla TSLA in the financial market. Is that what you were looking for or nah?
2021-04-18 13:11:19,wallstreetbets,"> but it’s not a shock

I get it lol"
2021-04-18 16:05:39,wallstreetbets,You think BB is going to $30?
2021-04-18 13:37:32,wallstreetbets,I respect it
2021-04-18 15:49:28,wallstreetbets,375 Shares at 18.95.. Buy it people and push it up the charts
2021-04-18 13:42:48,wallstreetbets,Good time to buy I suppose 😁
2021-04-18 15:12:08,wallstreetbets,Not a bad idea
2021-04-18 12:45:22,wallstreetbets,Well if he sells his TSLA he can buy a LOT of BB

2021-04-18 16:16:07,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, disregard that whole last message. I thought I was replying to a different comment and didn’t double check what post I was replying to. My January strikes are 10c. They’ve definitely depreciated a lot in value though because I think I bought these in mid February."
2021-04-18 15:46:57,wallstreetbets,even just using the money from 1 tsla could get ur avg bb cost to like 10.5
2021-04-18 16:25:07,wallstreetbets,"If you want my 2c, OP, you should do what giraffe says. Not that TSLA isn't going to have a runup, but that the share difference you can obtain going mostly BB, even 8k worth is 1k shares.

Don't listen to what these clowns say. Buying 1k shares and selling 10monthly covered calls is bullish and one of the more stable approaches you can have to long-term wealth development. Collecting premium if the price stays down to add to your shares. If the price goes up, you sell at a profit and collect premium. The ONLY way you lose money on the underlying shares is if the company bankrupts or never recovers to the point where covered calls < loss on underlying."
2021-04-18 16:26:04,wallstreetbets,You can turn it into a calculated yolo and buy 10/12/15c 2022/2023 leaps. That's my plan this week. There's no way this isn't trading for at least $20 by EOY and $60 by 2023.
2021-04-18 12:54:11,wallstreetbets,"Thats why I'm frowning and laughing.

If he seriously thought this was the next tesla, he would roll his profits into it and sell covered calls tbh, like most long term bulls would.

It seems like a newbie who got in on tsla hype"
2021-04-18 19:10:08,wallstreetbets,Worth a look at the two recent DDs here
2021-04-18 19:23:29,wallstreetbets,I just came
2021-04-18 15:39:22,wallstreetbets,"Read the about and see the part about stocks

Then look up stock gains posts that still exist in WSB

The sad state this place has become after GME."
2021-04-18 14:33:45,wallstreetbets,Shares gains are still allowed in WSB. This isn't new. Some people have posted about becoming millionaires through shares-only trading.
2021-04-18 16:54:25,wallstreetbets,That’s actually a really good idea. I might up your 1 to 8 and then sit back to enjoy the ride 🌊🏄‍♂️
2021-04-18 16:59:59,wallstreetbets,Good recommendations. I think I’ll go for 500 shares when the market opens tomorrow.

2021-04-18 19:15:15,wallstreetbets,I was shocked by how cheap the 10c 1/21/22’s are.
2021-04-18 15:19:12,wallstreetbets,Selling covered calls is neutral to bearish . If there's a huge run up you'll miss out on a big portion of it.
2021-04-18 19:24:45,wallstreetbets,Gotcha. They are definitely enticing prices.
2021-04-18 15:46:08,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-18 14:53:00,wallstreetbets,"Yes, that's why it wasn't removed...

Shareholders will still be mocked though, and that's certainly nothing new."
2021-04-18 17:12:48,wallstreetbets,I would. And sell CC weekly or biweekly to make some side money on it
2021-04-18 19:17:51,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Cant see how it isn't free money.
2021-04-18 15:31:47,wallstreetbets,"Selling covered calls is bullish to neutral. Missing out doesn't mean bearish. 

You make money on the calls and the stock if it does a run-up.

EDIT: Like, in what world would be buying the underlying asset of a company *bearish*. That's the most direct way to support them."
2021-04-18 15:51:58,wallstreetbets,"Not *all about shares*. My point is shares are a gamble, too. I don't see the difficulty in understanding that. Hedging against loss has never not been a thing here. Spreads and shit have made or lost money just fine.

*You could've made more if you bought options* is the same as *You could've made more if you threw your life savings into it*

There's gambling and then there's being stupid. This sub isn't r/dumbassbets . He made money by making a smart bet."
2021-04-18 17:18:52,wallstreetbets,CC?
2021-04-18 17:11:52,wallstreetbets,"Yup. I feel like the run won’t be for a little while yet. This isn’t the meme crap, it’s actually a legit rise. So while I wait, I sell short exp CCs while still monitoring it closely in case I need to buy them back quickly."
2021-04-18 18:10:56,wallstreetbets,Covered calls
2021-04-18 18:32:28,wallstreetbets,"If you wait for IV jumps and sell leaps, you can collect collect back quickly for 30% or so and if it doesn't get the opportunity, you made a ton on premiums + underlying."
2021-04-18 19:11:14,wallstreetbets,Leaps just make me a little nervous for stocks that I really believe in. I guess I could always buy them back though

The ATT comparison is apt, ATT should be at least 30% higher given that HBOMAX has yet to be priced in at all yet, but it's still stuck in a rut just barely above and below $30."

2021-04-18 15:55:32,wallstreetbets,"Op, why did you choose 17c instead of 15c? I'm new to options. Wouldn't 15c be more likely ITM and if it hits 17 make you more money?"
2021-04-18 19:41:03,wallstreetbets,Half a billion usd in income last year is pretty decent for a company that has a market cap of 6 billion.

2021-04-18 14:48:09,wallstreetbets,Keep in mind the buybacks will continue till Nov 2021 and as of Feb. that was around 8.5 million shares they won't have to pay dividends on since they are treasury shares.

2021-04-18 16:07:32,wallstreetbets,Tbh just less capital at the moment. If I’m gonna yolo want to accumulate more contracts and I’m bullish. But if you can buy the $15 and have the $$$$ to do so then ya it def makes sense

2021-04-18 13:25:03,wallstreetbets,"Tell me which other telco company is yelling to investors that they are ""focusing on ABC""... AI, Big Data and Cloud Services (or some similar cutting edge, for a telco, mission statement).

You're not understanding that KT already has brand reputation/respect of Google/Microsoft/etc. in Korea and the capability to expand like them. You look at ATT or Verizon in the United States and think robotics? Cloud services? Education platforms? You think of a Verizon AI service bot giving you room service at your favorite hotel? Definitely not, but KT is positioning themselves, not just in Korea, but in SE Asia as a major player for these industries and more (content distribution, content IP, energy, healthcare, hospitality, etc.).

Look at Korean tech adoption rates and you'll see it's very high- they are already testing so much stuff we could only dream of in USA. Besides that, they said they are going to focus on acquisitions, too... so if they are smart they can capitalize on that like Softbank, Yahoo (alibaba position), etc."
2021-04-18 10:15:21,wallstreetbets,Yep - majority of my account is small caps that got obliterated by the shorts over the last month
2021-04-18 11:32:33,wallstreetbets,Right - the options are super cheap. Even if the news is bad in May you still have 2 months to recover before expiry. From what I can tell they are similar to the US version of ATT or Verizon. I have a stock screener I use to find them ;)
2021-04-18 14:11:13,wallstreetbets,"Three as an example:

\- NTT have a whole arm for big data, named NTT Data that focuses on your ABC.

\- Deutsche Telekom offer an edge compute solution, basically encompassing your ABC. ([https://www.t-systems.com/de/de/events-messen/performantes-datenmanagement-mit-big-data](https://www.t-systems.com/de/de/events-messen/performantes-datenmanagement-mit-big-data))

\- PCCW have Infinitum. Encompasses Cloud, AI, and Data. ([https://www.pccwsolutions.com/site/en/infinitum/infinitum](https://www.pccwsolutions.com/site/en/infinitum/infinitum))

I'm not saying KT are small, but these guys are huge and have global connectivity so multinational corps would be able to home all of their services with the same provider. TBH, all of the providers look like they're trying to monetize the edge now.

I'm not trying to argue the value of the play - this could still be and probably will be a good play, I'm just trying to point out that there will be global competition for KT in offering those services."

2021-04-18 18:42:47,wallstreetbets,I appreciate your response and looked briefly into all those. I don't think those companies can compare to KT's ambition to enter new industries and transform to a digital platform company.

2021-04-18 09:47:11,wallstreetbets,"I was almost hoping to see PLTR in there. got greedy when she hit 25$ Tuesday, thought it was only up from there, kept the calls, now instead of 140% gains that turned to 100% loss more fun than a scratch-off tho lol"
2021-04-18 14:48:00,wallstreetbets,"Me too, despite my best efforts. I guess it comes with the territory."
2021-04-18 10:00:44,wallstreetbets,Please explain to me your thought process as to how CRM was going to get anywhere near your strike by that date.
2021-04-18 09:03:12,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I’m not sure where the market is going up... all I see is red, except in the indexes."
2021-04-18 10:17:52,wallstreetbets,Your loses are mostly guaranteed when you buy options out-of-the-money that far.There should be no surprise here.
2021-04-18 09:35:33,wallstreetbets,"Buying calls or puts have been always hit and miss for me. But selling puts whenever good names drop is close to 99% success for me, sold puts atleast 50+ times and have never been assigned.

I was selling puts on names which im ready to hold - AMD,NKE, MSFT,WMT,AMZN, INTC ,BABA to name a few."
2021-04-18 08:52:34,wallstreetbets,Market movement has nothing to do with options. Success in options are purely based on the correctness of your speculation. You can lose money on a stock that doubles if you thought it would triple.
2021-04-18 09:16:09,wallstreetbets,"I’ve crawled my way back from many losses, roughly 10k being the most. It’s not a good sight but there is money to made every day in the battlefield and even with some of the stupid comments on here. But if you can’t watch the market all day every day, then I do not suggest weekly options as a viable strategy to generate wealth. Go ATM a few months out and cut losses at your desired risk, mine is 15-25% loss. If I’m positive a few a weeks ahead then I’ll sell and use profit to buy shares. I won’t be a millionaire anytime soon but I also won’t be broke either. 

Yes, options trading can be a casino but only if you treat it like one."
2021-04-18 09:20:28,wallstreetbets,"What the fuck are those strikes!?

Please explain, 100C on AMD? What???"
2021-04-18 13:03:49,wallstreetbets,If it makes you feel better the idiots that manage my pension plan actually managed to lose money throughout 2020.
2021-04-18 08:34:52,wallstreetbets,That’s 100% how it goes. I’m heading for a hard mental breakdown on Tuesday when sndl doesn’t go up on 4/20
2021-04-18 08:55:13,wallstreetbets,Fwiw the markets' are at an all time high a lot.
2021-04-18 09:37:53,wallstreetbets,Portfolio taking a 30% cut... I'd be crying if I wasn't already laughing at how everything is 💲✔️except the dumpster🗑️🔥 fire I hold. Btw I hold $QS 🤡
2021-04-18 09:37:25,wallstreetbets,Are you me? Lost 3000 Friday on expired calld
2021-04-18 10:14:16,wallstreetbets,Spreading out and diversifying your losses. Good retard.
2021-04-18 10:14:58,wallstreetbets,Fcel gang
2021-04-18 09:57:52,wallstreetbets,Markets are all time high but I’m down 60% with fucking $BB.
2021-04-18 10:40:39,wallstreetbets,"Fun fact: you don’t have to hold options to expiry. In fact, if your thesis remains the same, you can and should probably roll your OTM long calls about 21 days to expiry to avoid the steepest time decay. If you like the stock, stay in the trade, but just in a more option-efficient manner! That said, if you want to just be a degenerate and gamble on weeklies, go right ahead lol"
2021-04-18 11:03:46,wallstreetbets,That’s a great example of so called wealth redistribution. When dumb money goes to smart money. Good job!
2021-04-18 12:23:14,wallstreetbets,Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
2021-04-18 10:09:15,wallstreetbets,Why didn't you buy SPY calls instead of retarded calls?
2021-04-18 08:49:56,wallstreetbets,"I have amd call expiry this Friday 85 C so.. most likely I am gonna lose money too. 
Let’s see,"
2021-04-18 10:03:51,wallstreetbets,Why let them expire? Cut your losers quickly. Theta decay ramps up hard closer to expiration
2021-04-18 09:28:01,wallstreetbets,3200$ is postable?
2021-04-18 09:56:10,wallstreetbets,My spy 400c was a week too early

2021-04-18 09:37:43,wallstreetbets,Buy TSLA and hold! That’s all you need to do
2021-04-18 09:26:54,wallstreetbets,"Volatility has also contracted a lot in the last while. It’s been a bad time over the last while to be a buyer, but a great time as a seller."
2021-04-18 10:01:26,wallstreetbets,We are definitely spinning the whole: “buy low sell high” thing on its head.
2021-04-18 10:29:00,wallstreetbets,Now I know and will only trade faang stocks when spy does a meteor dunk.
2021-04-18 11:11:23,wallstreetbets,I bought month out ITM SPY calls.  Don't worry. This will crash the market for sure!
2021-04-18 11:19:03,wallstreetbets,Here's how to take screenshots on most platforms: https://screenshot.help/
2021-04-18 14:25:17,wallstreetbets,Just play SPY and make a 50/50 game.
2021-04-18 15:20:43,wallstreetbets,"Yo, did anyone else hear about the New Jersey deli listed on the stock market? They did 35k in sales last year, valuation on the market is over 100 mil lol. Must make a mean sandwich. Can't mention the ticker or I'll get banned"
2021-04-18 10:18:55,wallstreetbets,They are shorting small cap growth stocks like crazy. So no wonder
2021-04-18 10:18:45,wallstreetbets,"You're not very good at futures trading, are you?"
2021-04-18 10:46:17,wallstreetbets,"buying OTM calls on boomer stocks like Nike, FedEx, FCEL and Salesforce that literally have no volatility?!

This is the way."
2021-04-18 09:16:29,wallstreetbets,I was up almost 10% 2 weeks ago overall. Now I'm only up about 1.5% overall
2021-04-18 10:09:55,wallstreetbets,You are not alone. I am in same boat
2021-04-18 10:21:24,wallstreetbets,Epic! Good work sir 😆😆😆
2021-04-18 10:25:52,wallstreetbets,All time high my ass. Was there a time warp and we are back in January? Fucking fake news!
2021-04-18 10:28:36,wallstreetbets,And here we go...
2021-04-18 10:30:46,wallstreetbets,Sounds about right
2021-04-18 10:39:14,wallstreetbets,"Eh, i lost 10k"
2021-04-18 10:46:02,wallstreetbets,My portfolio dropped from 250k to 85k since February while we are at ATH 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
2021-04-18 11:08:21,wallstreetbets,"I do around 30-40% of my portfolio in SPY and then I have a large chunk in the EV sector (without TSLA, as that’s now in the S&P). I use about 15-20% in options to try and increase my liquid capital. Most individuals have been bleeding money, while the past few months have been red for me it hasn’t been anything major due to my hedging."
2021-04-18 11:19:04,wallstreetbets,Congrats. This is the way tiger.
2021-04-18 11:20:52,wallstreetbets,AMD is probably the easiest call.
2021-04-18 11:47:08,wallstreetbets,AMD $100 strike lol. you belong here.
2021-04-18 11:57:32,wallstreetbets,"Indices were the betting instrument for record high margin, acting as gamma pins to psychological levels exceeding 4K s & p.. under the hood, whole system is unraveling.. bond spikes to 2% (again, that psychological #) were absolutely getting a 10% pullback.. if it continues it’s descent we have an undoing of reflation trade and deflationary environment.. hereby dragging indices down with if, whichever way we go, just a matter of when.. This message is brought to you by a man 100x levered $10M short SPY on 405-415 spy strikes"
2021-04-18 12:11:42,wallstreetbets,"AMD has never be in the three digits domain, and you bet not only on it reaches $100, but to just break even you need to it go above $107. Good luck on that."
2021-04-18 12:13:23,wallstreetbets,"Your mistake with AMD was going for 4/16 calls while earnings date is 4/27. Now imagine if AMD starts to rally next week as we approach ER?

Try not to go for very short maturities next time unless you have catalysts included in the life of your options (and even then, don't go for weeklies or 1M maturities)."
2021-04-18 12:33:46,wallstreetbets,"I lost money on near ITM calls too but my max loss was outrageous OTM calls. AMD 120c 3/19 bought in feb, PLTR 40c 5/21 bought in Feb."
2021-04-18 13:12:19,wallstreetbets,Yeah I had AMD 95c I bought back in feb. I was sure they would print but nope
2021-04-18 13:20:56,wallstreetbets,My growth portfolio has been red since the start of the year but my safe bets (extremely popular companies) portfolio is up fat (like 20% since I bought in last month). I have $50 in that portfolio. Now it is $65
2021-04-18 13:37:52,wallstreetbets,Just yolo otm 0dte SPY calls at open and you’ll be back on track
2021-04-18 14:23:51,wallstreetbets,AMD💯
2021-04-18 15:47:16,wallstreetbets,yikes AMD.
2021-04-18 16:25:24,wallstreetbets,"$100 AMD calls expiring April? You’re too optimistic, my friend. Or just really bad at timing."
2021-04-18 16:40:47,wallstreetbets,"Those AMD calls alone would seem to indicate that your brain is the smoothest substance known to exist

Keep up the good work!"
2021-04-18 17:40:00,wallstreetbets,"I got out of AMD. Idk what the hot fuck is going on there but Jesus, what a mess"
2021-04-18 17:59:04,wallstreetbets,"Don't buy AMD calls. \*edit -  OTM calls.

&#x200B;

try these for sideways moving stock:

* Short Straddle.
* Short Strangle.
* Long Call Calendar Spread.
* Long Put Calendar Spread.
* Iron Butterfly."
2021-04-18 18:08:54,wallstreetbets,"It's not timing the market, it's time in the market"
2021-04-18 19:51:52,wallstreetbets,"I also regret not selling my AMD calls on April 9th, but I still have a few weeks to go, at least before they expire."
2021-04-18 10:02:18,wallstreetbets,"Being retarded had its consequences.. just buy GME... and if u want to diversify, buy AMC"
2021-04-18 10:22:22,wallstreetbets,"Bless your heart!

 (a Southern US expression sometimes meaning: what an idiot you are 😉)

Stay strong. You’re safe here. We may laugh at you a little but we’ve all done the same."
2021-04-18 09:13:35,wallstreetbets,"Why I don’t do options trading I invest and hold, no offense to you I’m sure you’ve done well but I play with what I have."
2021-04-18 09:48:57,wallstreetbets,Every loss is an investment in your personal home education. Eventually you will get it back as long as your still learning.
2021-04-18 11:20:59,wallstreetbets,You needed AMD calls that expire after earnings come out this month. Preferably purchased when the stock was trading around $75. I bought the $90 leaps the past month. Hoping for a blowout ER.
2021-04-18 10:06:26,wallstreetbets,No GME in sight
2021-04-18 08:36:12,wallstreetbets,Damn i'm down -22% on  XL! They shorted It to the fucking ground and beyond

2021-04-18 10:35:52,wallstreetbets,Maybe you should pivot your strategy to one that makes money.
2021-04-18 10:36:04,wallstreetbets,Just means we're gonna kill it when the market is down. Dont forget your uno reverse card bitches
2021-04-18 10:37:59,wallstreetbets,Buy high sell low.

2021-04-18 10:43:48,wallstreetbets,I have been storing my money mostly in Coins and cash I took a hit in February and have just been waiting for what I like to finish selling off.
2021-04-18 10:47:04,wallstreetbets,Do we know if the market is still down because of the blown up hf. Lots of good stocks simply are not performing.
2021-04-18 10:47:05,wallstreetbets,Lol I relate to this

2021-04-18 10:55:33,wallstreetbets,I also see your XL positions and know the same pain. Though I gained when it was PIC.
2021-04-18 10:56:03,wallstreetbets,"I can tell you if the market is going up or down, but I’m not even going to try to do that AND say when it’s going to do so"
2021-04-18 10:58:17,wallstreetbets,It's the shorts. They're buying and selling stocks at the same price to keep the price from moving up and then they buy a lot (or cover shorts) get everyone hyped up and dump everything. Hits stop loss triggers and people pull out because of fear. They're also doing it to prevent options from being ITM. What I've been doing is getting puts on stocks that I see the pattern. They're going to bring it down I might as well make money on it.
2021-04-18 10:58:50,wallstreetbets,when you know that loss is coming your sphincter tightens up and it hurts more.
2021-04-18 10:59:41,wallstreetbets,"That because when you buy options, the odds are stacked against you. Options inheritly descrease in value bc of time decay. Notice the only green PL you have is a short call"
2021-04-18 11:00:36,wallstreetbets,That’s because you’re retarded.
2021-04-18 11:00:56,wallstreetbets,And you can even take a screenshot on your computer. GG
2021-04-18 11:02:58,wallstreetbets,All my stocks have gone down?!! Bout ready to say FUCK it
2021-04-18 11:09:53,wallstreetbets,"Your not alone. Didn’t something like $50B in Options expire worthless on Friday? When he was in office, TRUMP only tweeted bad news on China trade deal right before OpEx, only to make great progress the following Monday. This is an old game. The markets are rigged. Call writers own OpEx. Shitadel operates with impunity."
2021-04-18 11:18:33,wallstreetbets,"Bruh, all your strike prices are at or beyond ATH for each of those companies. Not even taking your BE point into consideration wtf were you expecting?"

2021-04-18 11:21:24,wallstreetbets,"Same, I'm down 58% overall on my portfolio, where is this bullish market I'm hearing so much about?"

2021-04-18 11:28:00,wallstreetbets,Some of us are better losers than others
2021-04-18 11:29:33,wallstreetbets,Should’ve just bought and held GME shares retard.
2021-04-18 11:31:08,wallstreetbets,Wierd it's almost like 95% of options expire worthless... Hmm..
2021-04-18 11:31:50,wallstreetbets,Maybe options are just not something you should focus on... a covered call with margin bought shares idk
2021-04-18 11:31:52,wallstreetbets,"Short term OTM options can bankrupt you.  Yes, a stock can move a ton in a short time, but if there was a good amount of information as to why, the price would reflect that.

In terms of earnings.  Much of this is factored in from people in the know, or a run-up to earnings.  This happened with NVIDIA this past summer when their earnings were great but the stock was stationary.  Another factor is stock manipulation from hedge funds and large funds.  They control the articles written about a stock and sway opinion even if you are trying to block it out, and their timed articles on important days should be another thing investigated besides their short selling.

Most of my big gainers have been year out call options on companies that were on the low end of their 52 week price.

Another thing that works is finding companies who are coming out with new products that are a few months away and take a gamble on year out options.  This works best if it is a small company with cheap OTM options."

\*Lesson for the day. There are winning options and losing options. Don't let them all be losing options. Cut your loses short. Let your profits ride.  Don't follow the option to 0 cause you still hold the winning lottery ticket. Cash out and move over to the next slot machine and pull the lever"

2021-04-18 12:03:38,wallstreetbets,"Don't know what your overall strategy is, but, if a simple call/put is so pricey that your portfolio takes a real hit if it expires at $0, then you need to either (1) buy a spread, which dramatically reduces the cost and/or (2) be ready to sell earlier if it's not going your way, because it'll at least have some time value.

I had a long call on TSM that would've expired as worthless on Friday. My prediction about TSM was simply wrong. But it had been a spread, mitigating my loss, and I jumped out of it Tuesday, so I could still recover some of the value.

As an exercise, go back and at least see when you should've jumped out of each of those, keeping in mind that you don't know the future, but you can see when things aren't really unfolding as you predicted.

2021-04-18 12:23:37,wallstreetbets,I would buy when stock is red and the call is in the money then ride that out looks like your trying to do that here but your prices are way off. So any drop in the stock will send those option values closer to 0

2021-04-18 12:47:07,wallstreetbets,"It's as if funds KNOW where the most pain is going to be and they somehow manage to trade either behind the scenes or openly to force the price to be to the penny. Now we all know places like RH and WeBull have records of what price hurts, and here is what they do:

Player 1 is looking to sell 100,000 shares. Player 2 is looking to BUY 100,000 shares. Most of the time, they do it in house and don't report it. They keep the vig between the two, and make about $150. If they want the price to go up and hurt the puts, they report some of the buys causing it to go up, and the sells they swap in a dark pool with other exchanges, or they take those sells and hang on to them without reporting them for 24 hours. They have enough cash to wait and deal with the swing. Then they can take all the sells, package them with shorts, and report them the next morning, causing it to crash. Plus, Melvin/RH can ALSO buy, knowing the stock is going up, and then tomorrow morning, sell theirs on the market making a profit, and then reporting all those other sales from yesterday, causing a giant sell off. Point is, if you are the middleman between the money and the market, you can hold the data and reporting for a period of time, handle trades internally, and manipulate like crazy."

I'm hoping for them to go up this week and I'll sell. I have held through big gains (50% plus) to only sell at a loss days or a week later. Fucking sucks.

Since you have the capital to be approved for naked options, that means you have the capital to afford ITM calls...

Sure, there’s less wow factor (going from $0.50 to $50 for a whopping 9,900% gain), however you will accomplish two things:

-Lower chance of being OTM (and thus worthless) at expiry

-higher absolute price increases with each increase in the underlying."

Not sure about AMD and FCEL, but with FDX ~~and NKE~~, going ITM would've worked out better although I know that's not in the spirit of WSB.

EDIT: looking a little deeper at those tickers, I think ITM call options bought at least a month ago would've only worked for FDX. AMD and NKE would be better off with longer dated options/leaps. FCEL - no clue."

2021-04-18 11:01:20,wallstreetbets,"If you are going to buy and hold, you can at least use cash secured puts to buy your stocks and then sell covered calls once you get the stock. Or if you are really worried about it being called away you can sell call credit spreads to hedge against decreases in the underlying value of your stock, or double down with put credit spreads if you are going to be riding the stock price up.  


Options can easily compliment a buy and hold strategy, just not way OTM calls that would require a new all time high to happen in order to make money lol. Those are frequently called lottery tickets for a reason lol."

\* Thank you to whoever used the Reddit Care Resources (self-harm report?) on me, I feel a ray of hope now! It's just a start, but I feel optimistic enough in this moment to hope that my future infected bottle fight wound death will be painless! BTW the message you get starts off like ""When you're in the middle of something painful, it may feel like you don't have a lot of options. But whatever you're going through, you deserve help and there are people who are here for you."" I hope that everyone who needs to know this, does.

2021-04-18 15:45:44,wallstreetbets,Why not both? I started trading two months ago and found out that best tool for beting is using high leverage. So IMO trading on different indices using x20 leverage or x5 leverage for boomer stocks is best risk/gain proposition there is. Also i dont need to spend days on DD. Nasdaq can move more than one percent a day and with x20 leverage that means more than 20% gain.

I thought another market crash was imminent due to the election hysteria and a resurgence in covid shutdowns.(mainly in Europe). So far I have missed out on approx. $120k in gains.

Now they're all falling back to fair prices for things that could go somewhere, but have yet to prove anything.

I saw an article that lumped them all together as priced for future profits, just a little too far out for comfort.  Guess they were right.

**I'll add that I jumped into FCEL before during and after all of this and was pleasantly surprised when they were linked to Hyundai's electric program.  I literally had zero knowledge of the stock, was just playing sentiment. I had July2021 12c bought when it was trading at 7 dollars.

Whether you find success or failure with options is in NO WAY tied to the market's movement, but it tied directly to your GUESS of what the market would do."

Disclaimer: I'm looking at picking up XL at $5-6

However, you're aware of the lawsuit Brager Eagel & Squire have against XL Fleets right?

A tldr: Lied about client base, lied about cost-benefit savings of their product, lack staff & supply chain to deliver on their promises.

Not sure how legitimate this is as they appear to have recurring business in this field, currently they've also filed a suit against AstraZeneca, not sure how they're going to deal with this given they have < 10 staff apparently.


>The complaint, filed on March 8, 2021, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that XL Fleet’s salespeople were pressured to inflate their sales pipelines to boost the Company’s reported sales and backlog; (2) that at least 18 of the 33 customers that XL featured were inactive and had not placed an order since 2019; (3) that XL’s technology had been materially overstated and offered only 5% to 10% of fleet savings; (4) that XL lacks the supply chain and engineers to roll out new products on the announced timelines; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

My bad it was only $210 million.

On top of this, Nardelli alienated shareholders. He was being paid enormous sums of money over a period of years when the performance of Home Depot’s stock was lackluster. During his tenure, Home Depot’s stock value dropped 8%, while Lowe’s shares soared some 180%.

“The pay package had a lot to do with it,” Henderson says of the shareholders’ unhappiness, noting that Nardelli’s cash salary, plus cash bonuses, totaled over $65 million from the time he joined Home Depot in December 2000 through 2005. “That is far in excess of any of his peers.” At the same time, Nardelli was given stock options, but they were not structured in a way that would link them with the company’s share price. “It didn’t appear he had great incentive to get the stock price higher,” Henderson notes. “The stock was down 8% between the time he joined and the time he left. People were just disgusted by that.”"

The only difference is that Dodd-Frank raised the bar on the minimum requirements to get a mortgage to stop banks from using swaps to justify giving mortgages to deadbeats. 

We’re just starting the process of getting over COVID and underemployment is a real issue. With low interest rates stifling economic growth, all we need is a catalyst to trigger mass defaults and we’re right back to 2007."

It’s a little more high-risk, high-reward.

If you’re not afraid to leave near people who aren’t 100% white there’s a ton of nice places around Boston.  People forget that the biggest winners in the Boston real-estate market have been in neighborhoods regular people wouldn’t touch like the South End.  East Boston is probably a uniquely good opportunity right now if you can find a place with a good commute to downtown."

Invest in yourself before real-estate. The quickest way to make money without starting with a bunch of it is by snagging a higher-paying job. Look into local community/tech schools. They usually have some type of 1-2 year program that will put you on the right track to a decent career. Even if it's not what you want to do forever it can jump start your earnings and if you keep your standard of living the same for a couple years you can accumulate a nice chunk of capital to pivot to something else."

2021-04-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"#NotBillHwang - Trading hedged at 21x leverage with limited upside/downside risk and over 258% return over the past 12mo (repost) Some people dug out my old posts and asked questions what have I been doing lately, so I thought of posting up update here. Still using risk-based margin portfolio, but moved to 20-26x leverage from 8-12x before. I still don't recommend ANYONE doing this, you have to have decent starting capital (I started with 109k) and allocate time (you cannot do this and have a day job that overlaps with the market trading hours).

My strategy is currently diversifying (bought into SpaceX and Stripe secondaries) and preparing to do an OTC direct listing in US and Canada. I believe it is important to have a long investment horizon, and mine is 5-10y at the moment.

Things that appeared to help:

1. develop and apply a strong understanding of macro-conditions
2. explore and become comfortable with the broker risk model
3. manage portfolio in real-time

These days I probably make only 3-5 trades in a regular session, with bursts of activity if rebalancing is needed or a rally/drop took place in one of my underlyings. Sharpe (1-year) is 1.67

I am still long ""misunderstood"" equities and short cash and volatility. And I owe a big thank you to Reddit for making me think about this in 2019. It's a nice journey.

There is no such thing as 21x leverage on IBKR, unless you are trading extremely low vol positions like deep in the money covered calls or box spreads, in which case your actual delta, ie your actual exposure, is basically zero, even though it LOOKS like you are taking huge risks. The opposite is when you take huge option bets in a cash account, it'll always show your leverage is under 1 even though in actuality you are jacked to the tits.

There is also no where to buy ""Stripe secondaries"" unless he is invested in one of the VC funds, which is possible, but directly in Stripe with $1m? LOL. They have one of the most anal transfer restrictions out of the all the hot startups, why do you think they are not on ANY pre IPO platforms?

2021-04-18 14:39:58,wallstreetbets,What makes it private then ?
2021-04-18 10:59:05,wallstreetbets,"My definitions of a 'retirement plan' and 'hedging against risk' are equal to having a ""side bet in XLM"" and ""buying shares of AAPL"" respectively. 
  
So you must be doing something right."
2021-04-18 17:19:58,wallstreetbets,Did you invest in PE for these or through one of these platforms like equityzen?
2021-04-18 10:21:53,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but the key differences are that float isn’t subject to margin call, and his insurance companies underwrite profitably, so the “margin interest” is effectively a negative rate."
2021-04-18 12:50:53,wallstreetbets,"I think he's legitimately a good investor but also if you look at the history from partnerships to the insurance company a ton of his personal wealth comes from using other people's money. So yeah, if that's who the quote is from, he's got to be referring to a very specific kind of margin investing where you can get margin called"
2021-04-18 09:58:05,wallstreetbets,Yup
2021-04-18 09:55:10,wallstreetbets,What do you mean? My $60  gonna in to a swift million 98 years from now
2021-04-18 07:34:12,wallstreetbets,lol
2021-04-18 09:35:08,wallstreetbets,You belong here after all. I was skeptical from your OP.
2021-04-18 14:35:53,wallstreetbets,Care to share how you lost it?
2021-04-18 11:33:32,wallstreetbets,Funny you understand this is irresponsible but this is exactly what the big boys do. “Hedge” then lever up. Except they don’t think it’s wrong since it’s mathematically correct. Just not practically. Insanity.
2021-04-18 13:07:30,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like a right ball ache, I'll stick to my cash account. Good luck xx"
2021-04-18 10:10:39,wallstreetbets,Do you know what scenarios they use as part of their stress tests?
2021-04-18 11:14:02,wallstreetbets,"*10 minutes later*

#""STOP RESISTING!!"""
2021-04-18 10:30:05,wallstreetbets,"Back in 2019 I posted some theses in WSB (mostly shorting junk bonds stuff). I used to have 3-4 plays a year and was pretty public about them (Palantir, SPACs, Nelnet) and getting feedback and debate is the best way to refine your plan.
Figured out how to 4-6x a long time ago. Doing it hedged and scaling (my stretch test was 28x I think) is different - you learn about liquidity and counterparty risk the hard way. No idea what others are doing, never cared. Some peeps appear to somehow find old posts and popup on chat, but I forget to login and answer so today just happened to be a good time 🤷🏻‍♂️"
2021-04-18 08:41:37,wallstreetbets,"this account since June 2019, in the markets since 2007"
2021-04-18 10:39:33,wallstreetbets,Actually a younger dude. I don’t know what he saw in me. Maybe it was out of pitty.
2021-04-18 10:18:10,wallstreetbets,Told my girlfriends husband I would break up with her if he didn't get me into SpaceX.
2021-04-18 10:38:17,wallstreetbets,"No, access liquidity. Nuance."
2021-04-18 12:39:20,wallstreetbets,What do you mean by this? They have holdings in spacex?

2021-04-18 13:31:53,wallstreetbets,"I mean, if you think that's bad, you really don't want to understand how our financial system works."
2021-04-18 12:16:13,wallstreetbets,"I saw the tesla position mentioned. So you are stock picking and then hedging with options. I used to trade 100x hedged while licensed but I wouldn't hold overnight.  Basically, retired now but I might get back into it if I can wake up early enough for the opening bell."

2021-04-18 17:41:25,wallstreetbets,I upvoted you
2021-04-18 09:29:33,wallstreetbets,"Ah yeah, that makes sense. 

Something to consider for sure, although I'm definitely gonna be waiting for an entry since I think VIX has room to run at least in the short to medium term given how crap liquidity in the overall market has been lately.

Thanks for answering :)"
2021-04-18 09:33:06,wallstreetbets,What percentage do you hedge in relation to your options. How does this help with the Vega? Are they constantly expiring hedges as you approach your strike date? This seems like it could go tits up fast.
2021-04-18 09:47:09,wallstreetbets,"Nah I'm in the same boat.   
Trying to figure this all out.   
You definitely seem like you haven a much better understanding of the markets than I do; but I'm learning...

I'm about where you were when you started as far as capital is concerned but I'm lacking on how to use it properly..
Where did you learn the ropes?"
2021-04-18 09:37:43,wallstreetbets,Can you explain in details layman style? Sounds very pro but I am an ape so don’t understand what you are saying.
2021-04-18 15:02:10,wallstreetbets,Risk Navigator is the name of the software component from Interactive Brokers’ interface this composite screenshot is from (TWS).

2021-04-18 10:11:38,wallstreetbets,Hi friend :)
2021-04-18 17:00:04,wallstreetbets,what broker offers it?
2021-04-18 14:35:23,wallstreetbets,Oh thank you. So I can't basically damn
2021-04-18 15:43:49,wallstreetbets,"Not looking for a rebuttal, but personally I have a hard time believing this thing can get to 1T market cap in the same ballparks of much more diversified companies like MSFT, APPL, AMZN.  So far I've just been making fun of people who's hopes are dashed any time it barely breaches $25."

2021-04-18 10:10:36,wallstreetbets,"The NASA deal is tiny in the big scheme of things, but the PR value huge, just like you described. Let’s see - there’s a lot of hassle to make these investments so you really have to see big returns to justify them."

2021-04-18 17:11:57,wallstreetbets,"If you can take 200k to 1mn it’s worth going direct. Smaller than that, pool with friends and go through a proxy.
There’s admin fee, management fee, broker fee and carry in many deals.
Plus the share price might be synthetic to cover other fees.
You want to get rid of as many as those as possible - I accept admin fee and carry only."
2021-04-18 19:15:51,wallstreetbets,Still a shit ton of money though
2021-04-18 15:23:30,wallstreetbets,Gotcha
2021-04-18 16:01:27,wallstreetbets,They aren't publicly traded.
2021-04-18 11:00:12,wallstreetbets,"That’s why I want to go public as well (small scale, at first) to reduce the liquidity pressure and access more capital in a simple way"
2021-04-18 17:22:01,wallstreetbets,Not through platforms. I invest alongside institutional investors - wealth managers on behalf of their clients for example. In Palantir I know anecdotally we had a George Soros fund on the same block.
2021-04-18 10:28:01,wallstreetbets,"Accurate, but the float is subject to needing to be paid out (which can also happen suddenly if a massive event happens at the same time as a market crash brought on by a disaster causing insurance loses). It’s mostly just really disingenuous to say Buffet doesn’t use margin, when he really just uses types of margin that most of us can’t get at"
2021-04-18 17:30:51,wallstreetbets,He can watch a stock go to $0.01 without being forced out of the trade for a loss. And he doesn't pay interest on his investments. But it would all be pointless if he didn't pick the best stocks year after year. I imagine he finds it all a little boring.
2021-04-18 13:30:05,wallstreetbets,I know why you're laughing and it's not for the reasons others are....
2021-04-18 10:01:23,wallstreetbets,"Nope, I have clear symptoms and coming here feels like going on vacation from my regular routine."
2021-04-18 14:46:57,wallstreetbets,"Early (before the first big spike) I wrote some short straddles (100 lot) at 55 or 75, few weeks out. It’s a bit of a blur but when it started moving up I rolled, then it was coming down and I closed a leg being greedy and before I closed the other it moved up. I could have rolled if not for the initial margin req constrain - got uncomfortable with the loss level and closed. Needless to say, had I not messed the original trade or let emotion have a say, it would have been manageable. I made a good chunk back with stock and options a few days later, and I am out now - but historically it’s my biggest single trade loss. On the other hand, I am happy for whoever bought my calls - I deserved what happened to me."
2021-04-18 11:38:20,wallstreetbets,"I just don’t suggest anyone does this. There’s secret sauce and elbow grease to it, but most people wouldn’t do the work anyway."
2021-04-18 10:12:11,wallstreetbets,"Some of the info is public (+/-30% spot price, +/-300% volatility change) but there are hidden factors (proprietary risk model) they won’t tell you (meaning a simple test using TIMS will not match IBKR margin requirements in edge cases)"
2021-04-18 18:44:55,wallstreetbets,"More like, sure why not, we give this to almost anyone. What's the worst that can happen? Cue market crash..."
2021-04-18 14:16:48,wallstreetbets,"I thought I was starting to understand trading, but I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about :/"
2021-04-18 09:48:52,wallstreetbets,Bandit in the 2008 crash or ruined?
2021-04-18 11:44:05,wallstreetbets,By 'access liquidity' do you mean 'have cash'?
2021-04-18 13:11:38,wallstreetbets,"Yes, 10% split with Fidelity"
2021-04-18 15:46:52,wallstreetbets, Yes.

2021-04-18 16:00:25,wallstreetbets,Big guys get bailed out. Retail gets bent over.
2021-04-18 14:58:59,wallstreetbets,"I think I know what you mean. I’d need a prime account for that. Too small for now. If you get back in the game or have time to share thoughts with plebs, I’d like to connect, time permitting"
2021-04-18 14:09:25,wallstreetbets,"If you could swap “full of shit” for “huge ego” you got my number. I’m out of fucks to give for a long time, not selling anything. People I do business with learn to appreciate the privilege."
2021-04-18 09:36:13,wallstreetbets,"Not sure what you mean by percentage to hedge - you might be thinking delta hedging.
I think in terms of risk - if you look at the chart, plotting SPX on the X axis and percentage changes from spot, the PnL can move drastically (there are two more curves to account for sensitivity to changes in volatility but they make little sense out of hours).
My hedges get rolled when needed, not expire."
2021-04-18 09:52:41,wallstreetbets,I am a practitioner first - so learn by doing. Collected a bunch of good people on WhatsApp as well. But primarily doing something every day gives you some advantage.
2021-04-18 09:41:45,wallstreetbets,"They’re just big words, nothing pro about it. We come from big apes. Think of a basic long/short portfolio (you offset some risk in long stocks by shorting others). Same here - only that instead of shorting stocks (I am not good at that, see Melvin) I am short something else - cash and volatility."
2021-04-18 15:41:20,wallstreetbets,"Oh the desktop version. And what does risk navigator do/show, ?"
2021-04-18 12:57:56,wallstreetbets,God I hope this comment chain works out and we get a report when this man is rich and single or broke and single.

2021-04-18 15:47:50,wallstreetbets,I went in at 6.05 and been following the company since 2018. There are some paths that could get them there. The “reset” conversation and the founders clout work well together. Let’s see.
2021-04-18 17:24:41,wallstreetbets,Just make sure you’re hedged... pretty volatile as long as “misunderstood”
2021-04-18 10:07:11,wallstreetbets,I own a carnival cape. Same thing.

2021-04-18 10:56:35,wallstreetbets,"SpaceX is my biggest desirable investment and probably will be for years. They are progressing at rates far faster than the competition and have not only massive ambition, but the ability to back that ambition up with action.

I only see SpaceX becoming a world dominator, and if that shit ever goes public (or my wallet ever gets lubed up enough for me to slide in privately) I am going to throw money at that company like my life depends on it."
2021-04-18 14:53:03,wallstreetbets,"OP, do you think Blue Origin (with existing advancement from SpaceX) will be a ‘neck and neck’ competitor in your horizon/after and whether it’s a decent move to hedge against the initial investment and also go long on Amazon’s space attempt?"
2021-04-18 11:29:08,wallstreetbets,... you trying to hire any college interns?
2021-04-18 17:24:36,wallstreetbets,Sorry to keep prying but are these thru individual relationships or through your bank/broker?  I only ask bc I’m trying to get access to some of these without having to commit 500k or more to a single PE/VC fund.
2021-04-18 10:15:14,wallstreetbets,Oh cool thanks for replying :)

2021-04-18 12:28:54,wallstreetbets,How much capital would you need to get involved in something like this? What's the process like? I know you said it's a headache but if you could do a short explanation I would appreciate it.
2021-04-18 12:46:12,wallstreetbets,What’s min buy?  I’m an accredited investor by definition.
2021-04-18 13:17:02,wallstreetbets,"You show me a paystub I come work for you. But forreal if it’s a hassle; how much is the buyin. I’m not a financial ape; but I do like space x and the things it represent. Now what are the laws in regarding such as if you were to collect funds from here from a bunch of apes into one giant deposit and then invest that through you in space x on our behalf? I am sure there will need to be some filings etc as now your taking private money and investing on our behalf but we are deciding where it goes (atm space x) payouts are based on percentage put in of course. Wouldn’t be to hard to create a private account only statement system showing x in and x out and percentages. Technically speaking it’s just a website that will allow accounts that have access to view the balance and payouts; database driven. I dunno the start of super stonk fund? Investing in growth of life and human kind and not the evil fund profiting off the backs of the working every day person

Because one would assume yes 1000.00 buyin is crap but if you got like 10k users that’s a lot of buying power; quantity works in numbers too i mean if the whole gme thing showed us anything."
2021-04-18 11:47:40,wallstreetbets,I’m interested. In learning about the process at least
2021-04-18 11:06:08,wallstreetbets,"I would love to but I am FAR too small time for that to be viable for me at the minute (as in they would laugh me off). One day if I come into a good amount of money I'd be all for it - if it went public though then I could buy in bit by bit and gradually build my position with smaller amounts, albeit at far higher prices (probably).

Thanks for the offer though, I appreciate it."
2021-04-18 11:50:18,wallstreetbets,"Y'know, grease the ole pig"
2021-04-18 17:29:17,wallstreetbets,"Thanks.  I have a meeting w JPM next week to try to get into IPOs they underwrite but I really prefer to be early stage.  I wanted to get into coinbase back in 2016 but had to wait until now, when it’s at a price Im not willing to pay for it.  All the major growth happens pre-ipo it seems, so it’s too bad for smaller investors"
2021-04-18 14:41:40,wallstreetbets,At least you know where to find me. 🙂

2021-04-18 15:06:22,wallstreetbets,There must be offers out there - in my experience 200k-1mn it’s worth going “direct” below that pool money with friends and use a proxy

2021-04-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CBOE VIX Options: Maybe Overdo for a Sharp Move Higher Hey, guys. I decided to bring out the ol' Excel to get some data on the SPY over the last 12-months to measure the money flow, and I found something super interesting.

Money flow is essentially the inflow and outflow of money coming into a particular company, asset class, or security. It's a good way of measuring market participation. Higher market participation in bullish times often takes equities to new highs, but in bearish times it becomes a drag on equity prices. When money flow oscillates in tighter intervals, we tend to see more spikes in volatility rather than when it oscillates slightly or not at all.

Let us take a lot at the SPY and the charts representing it. We have the price index, the total flows, the inflow(+) and outflow (-), and the net flow charts. Taking all of this information together, you may see where I come to the conclusion of why the market is overdue for a little more volatility, which means that VIX options are in play for the next few weeks most likely.

[This is the price index of the SPY on a per day basis over a 12-month period. We have reaching higher highs in the recent weeks while volatility has been dropping. This is a classic bearish sign for the market. Not to say that we will see a correction by any means, just a little bit more volatility, I think. Like I said, high volatility in a bull market is good. In a bear market, not so much.](https://preview.redd.it/hbfiz3fwcut61.png?width=2475&format=png&auto=webp&s=4910cea6eea6159d41c54f078e49d8e623051df6)

[This  is the total flows on a per day basis over the same period of time. As you can see, volatility dropped in the most recent weeks in comparison to those before and the SPY went up. Reiterating: it's a bearish signal based on historical measurements. But expecting volatility is not the same as saying I'm a bear. I'm just seeing perhaps more swings in the weeks to come to both the downside and the upside. If we're in bullish mindset, the price will trend up. If bears take over, hold on to your hats.](https://preview.redd.it/bwqkuld1dut61.png?width=2486&format=png&auto=webp&s=a093c106910abe22916074072cb7df322f8dff17)

[This is the inflow\/outflow chart over the same period of time. Notice the higher frequency on the left-side of the chart vs the right-side. This tells me that there is higher market activity as larger volumes of inflows and outflows are happening in tighter spreads, thus giving the \\""clustered\\"" effect. As we look towards the right-side of the graph, we see a lower frequency as inflow and outflow activity isn't so active and the spreads look \\""looser.\\"" The money flow frequency can change at any moment but just be aware that the frequency starts going higher because of an event that forces it. Often that event happens after a low frequency environment. We are currently in a low frequency environment.](https://preview.redd.it/gy3vyq0idut61.png?width=2466&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbca5977189fdc9e7e6e30d1d3e55396b6a19c85)

[This graph represents the total net flows per month. The peaks \(i.e. turning points\) show where the CBOE Volatility Index \(VIX\) has stabilized. Since the last spike in the VIX around late January\/early February, we haven't seen the VIX consolidate at a bottom. The data for April is only partially available because the month isn't complete, so do not take the line upward following the last turning point as a definite sign of stabilization. However, if we can assume that the final line going upward will average the current rate of return that is already there, then we may be due for a stabilization test soon.](https://preview.redd.it/v4e4xp2ceut61.png?width=2173&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d4c0a2c3b3b7ab1c7426e42db700438c644f425)

You can see the correlations between the VIX stabilization and the net flow peaks around the period by comparing the chart above with the one below.

https://preview.redd.it/oc2wlpcbfut61.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=f599b35562d2b4494e138b98de2358ea5de66052

Based on this argument, I think we may start seeing the VIX consolidate at around this level. We're in a low frequency environment, the perfect spot for when high frequency starts to kick in. After a test of stabilization, we either see a sharp move upwards or the continuation of a slow decay before it gets retested again. Are we at a place of consolidation, or are we quickly approaching one? I don't know for certain, but I like to follow the money.

&#x200B;

Edit: Title: meant to say ""overdue."" It's late."
2021-04-18 01:59:53,wallstreetbets,"Solid DD, I’ve been eyeing the VIX for a few other glaring reasons.  Thanks for the confirmation bias,  I’ll pick up some 20Cs for .20c 😉"
2021-04-18 02:40:42,wallstreetbets,"I have been waiting for VIX to hit $15, but it seems like a lot of investors are antsy. Bonds selloff recently raised cash for those who sold. Why? Banks offered huge bond sales to raise cash. Why? London did not hide that it intended to push gold spot price up last week, but the bond to gold trade to shift cash reserve positions is not appropriate for this recovery environment. Why? Was it to pad the value to take a little edge off of a coming massive fall? Warren Buffet exited bank positions leading into a recovery, which is another strange move to raise cash. Why?

All of this tells me that big money is preparing large cash positions to support future buys. A fair case for the banks is that they need to support higher housing costs for mortgages, but that doesn't feel right to me. Banks could draw more debt from FedRes, but they chose to raise cash through traditional means. Banks also traditionally sell gold and silver, preferably near the top to front run other big sellers. I expect this to happen, and with the debt competition between banks and investment firms, and due to the dynamics of recent sovereign challenges, I expect fierce gold sells to plunge gold spot price. All of this leads me to believe that coming is a major shift of investment capital out of commodity heavy exchanges and into storefront & webmarket exchanges.

My bet is that VIX is about to double, so FOMO is adding anxiety daily.

I am a novice individual investor who makes awful investment decisions that leads me to ruin, and I am not qualified to give advice about investments, finance, or anything."

2021-04-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What does today's San Felipe 250 mean for $RIDE short term? Who bought 4/23 puts last week?

For those following today's race in Baja in which Lordstown Motors entered a souped up version of their EV truck ""Endurance,"" hopefully you're already trying to figure out what to do with your positions Monday at open. For those who didn't follow the race,  despite what Lordstown released on Facebook and Twitter, it really can't be viewed as anything other than a disaster. 

The truck's battery gave out at mile 40, at which point the driver (who is apparently a janitor or security guard at LM) veered a mile off course so they could recharge. The truck sat not moving for around two hours before taking the wrong route to get back on course and finally deciding to just turn around and drive back to the start via the highway. 

Honestly, that's not the worst part.  Lordstown posted a video to Instagram showing the truck in action during the race.  It was *ahem* ...underwhelming. My 68 year old mother would have passed them on the shoulder in her 10 year old Chevy Malibu and flipped them the bird for driving like a bitch. One of the biggest concerns many have had about this truck is that having the motors in the wheel hubs versus mounted to the body would cause serious issues on bumpy terrain and lead to the motors being rendered inoperable when you hit a pothole. The video of them driving Miss Daisy though the Baja desert did not assuage these fears for me.  Perhaps it did for others. Perhaps I'm overreacting. 

I had hoped to see them go balls to the wall.  Announce their presence with aplomb and say ""Here we are, America! Come get yours off the line in September!"" At least then if it broke down (like literally 50% of the entrants in this race), you could at least say ""Hey, we went for it.  We've got some things to work on before next year's race, but the truck is still a winner."" Instead, they drove it like a 90 year old who is driving for the first time in their life five minutes after smoking their first fatty. And they still broke down 40 miles into the 250 mile race. Really disappointing. 

So, positions. 

200 shares @ 11.95 average that I expect to lose value as I will continue to hold long term. 

15 4/23C $13
25 4/23C $12
25 4/23C $10
10 4/23P $8 

The options were stupid and overly optimistic, but I bought them as lottery tickets hoping that Lordstown would push the truck to the limits today.  They didn't. 

My only source of hope right now is that this market makes no sense.  Maybe they'll shake this off and spike Monday. Should have joined the theta gang and sold some covered calls of my shares.

Edit: more embarrassment.  The other EV in the race,  lovingly nicknamed ""the shitbox,"" which is nothing more than an old 4runner mated with a damn Nissan Leaf is still going strong and on pace to finish under the time limit."

2021-04-18 04:33:22,wallstreetbets,"I think you’re overreacting on a couple things. 1) the video of them driving was at a decent speed? They were going over a severe bump. Didn’t look like they should send it flying. 2) they didn’t break down. The car was “running” (fans and some movement) for three hours before it started, and then the battery died at mile 40 (obviously a huge miscalculation on their part). Mechanically it didn’t break down. 
  
The concern is that this is a huge PR misstep. This shows that leaderships unwavering confidence does not mean the things they say are actually true."
2021-04-18 00:42:42,wallstreetbets,Yeah calls are probably dead but I still think this whole entrance into Baja racing was pretty ballsy. I just hope they have a solid manufacturing plan in place that is better than their race planning.
2021-04-18 00:47:02,wallstreetbets,"Lordstown performed as expected. A virgin team with an untested truck didn't finish and had technical and navigation issues. 

Anybody that follows this racing is not shocked. Anybody else is going to find exactly what they wanna see in the results. Tesla fans are going to say it's the end of hub motors and how a Tesla would have done better, ICE fans are going to claim that this proves EV is not an option, Lordstown fans are going to say it's the start of something great but have some teething issues to work through. Lordstown showed up, where was Tesla or the Hummer EV? So short term this only reinforces what they already believed.  Only thing that would have changed this is a win. 

Long term one race means even less.  I mean without Googling it where did the Ford Bronco R finish in the BAJA 1000 in 2019? It was a total disaster. And people are still excited and they still sell every one that they can build. 

Next short Score race is the Baja 400 in September, Best in the Desert has a few shorter races starting in August. If they enter those and DNF that's when you start to worry.

2021-04-18 18:18:05,wallstreetbets,"They rocked up. With something. That ran. It didn’t catch fire.

If you believed the hit piece put out on them, they didn’t even have that.   
I call spread 12.5 and 14 options 4/23 - also have some leaps - and don’t expect much other than the short term ones expiring worthless tbh.   


The leaps I’ll keep just in case."

2021-04-17 23:19:08,wallstreetbets,I want to know more about the shitbox
2021-04-17 22:37:06,wallstreetbets,Is the endurance not trying to capture the regular consumer truck market like f150 type?  Those don't need to go off roading at all.  Just hauling shit from Home Depot and back is good enough?  Idk is that their market?  I watched the CEO interview after the short report and I was like wtf did he really say that they didn't have real orders.  Lmao
2021-04-17 22:44:19,wallstreetbets,"This is such a bummer because much apes are thirsty for an EV stock that's not run by Elon... but one that has some drip.

Guess we'll all be waiting for the Rivian IPO?"
2021-04-18 09:38:41,wallstreetbets,"I'm with OP on this one. Given all the terrible publicity and seriously shake confidence in this company, I wanted to see their driver come out dressed like Mad Max and just floor their shitty little truck into the baja desert while screaming out the window. If it ends in a fireball and a pile of twisted wreckage, good; that would at least generate some excitement and allow them to give it a positive spin. Driving like an incontinent retiree and having the truck crap out at mile 40 does nothing to reverse the FUD around this truck and this stock.

2021-04-18 00:43:44,wallstreetbets,Thanks for posting this btw. I watched it on track leader and was curious how other people are viewing it.
2021-04-18 06:06:18,wallstreetbets,Ride keeps digging itself into a hole. This early in evs you have to trust management but I don’t see how anyone does it
2021-04-18 11:48:36,wallstreetbets,"Quit trying to panic people for cheapies, dipshit OP.  You know none of us that are still holding are selling, and that the more exposure we get, the more people can see the bear case is dead."
2021-04-17 22:50:48,wallstreetbets,I bought both. The put was so much cheaper than the call. But I guess see how the market reacts. Disappointed they didn’t do better. Had high hopes for this
2021-04-17 22:34:21,wallstreetbets,"Wait I was downvoted and told I didn't know anything for believing they might actually be a scam company and a pump and dump for bagholders. 🤔🤔🤔

You mean to tell me that the only ride you're getting with Lordstown Motors is the shaft???"
2021-04-18 13:38:32,wallstreetbets,"I'm just gonna leave this DD here for you. You probably aren't going to like what it has to say but it's brutally honest about the EV plays including RIDE.

2021-04-18 07:12:15,wallstreetbets,Sorry dudes but there's no way hub motors are gonna compete in a Baja race. This company's been already outed as a purveyor of smelly falsehoods. Why are you guys holding onto it?

2021-04-17 22:23:56,wallstreetbets,"Agreed.  I'm holding long term and I did mention that 50% of vehicles don't make it.  However,  don't give me all these fluff press releases leading up to the race about what a milestone it is to be entering such grueling race and then quit after 40 miles of driving like a retiree on a golf cart in Palm Beach."
2021-04-18 02:16:26,wallstreetbets,The truck could still prove to be a viable fleet truck as it was originally intended for
2021-04-17 22:35:58,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I can see the logic of that and of this - most companies play it safe and hide their failures. Fucking up publicly and going ""lol... okay, anyway..."" actually does paint a better picture than damage control. Hopefully $RIDE understands this and talks loudly about what went wrong and why. Be SpaceX detonating a rocket on the pad and then teaching everyone a little rocket science about what went wrong and how it'll be fixed next time."
2021-04-17 23:19:26,wallstreetbets,They partnered with brenthel to build the truck. Those guys build top notch Baja trucks. Seems like a great place to start and really sounds like they were serious. To do that and then not bring in a pro driver was a huge mistake.
2021-04-17 22:40:31,wallstreetbets,A golf cart has functioning motors and also doesn't catch on fire at 15 MPH. Likely would go further than 40 miles as well.

This was a PR stunt. Either it goes incredibly well for you, or incredibly poorly. There is no middle ground.

Just ""showing up"" is not an option.

Did you think you were selling Redbull in a bikini? Have you SEEN the trucks that race in that thing?

You're basically saying ""we can keep up."" Then keep the fuck up."
2021-04-18 14:45:27,wallstreetbets,The expectations of the company being a fraud are priced in. This didn't help.
2021-04-17 22:54:10,wallstreetbets,"It looks like it isn't there anymore. On Facebook, ""FishGistics"" has a video on their page of it.  Quite a few of the posts there are very critical of Lordstown's effort today."

The do have a vehicle, it did enter the race, and while it performed poorly, it is hard to put them in ""scam company"" territory at this point.

That doesn't mean they won't fail; however."
2021-04-17 22:57:24,wallstreetbets,I still hope longterm that they produce a solid truck.  It would be a win for US jobs and the overall market if they do.  Today was a loss for me though.
2021-04-18 11:15:52,wallstreetbets,"Eh, the hatchet piece written about them is from Hindenburg Research who is a dubious source who certainly has financial interest in RIDE stock declining.

2021-04-18 07:17:49,wallstreetbets,This point exactly. Before Tesla was anything other than a serb inventor who got cia'd. There was a company in Calgary Canada that sold conversion kits to turn your car electric. They had a Ford ranger kit that came complete with batteries and controller etc for 5grand usd. Once these ev companies emerged poof... the company doesn't exist anymore and I can't find any conversion kits online.
2021-04-17 22:18:43,wallstreetbets,Sorry I don’t really know cars. Why were hub motors not tested
2021-04-17 22:27:18,wallstreetbets,Offer to be their driver for next year!  Matt Damon can play you in the future movie.
2021-04-17 22:58:17,wallstreetbets,"*THIS*

More than half don't finish.  (I think it's closer to 33% finish)

If they didn't finish that would have been one thing if they really went all out and had a glorious failure.  This is also what we were expecting after the hype to the event.  (E.g. them really pushing the truck)

Instead, they ran super conservatively and STILL broke down. 

This right here is going to tank the stock.  Going ""balls to the walls"" from the start and breaking would have been a far different reaction, especially if they played it off correctly.  

And then of course, their post-failure responses have been crappy as well.  

Expect the stock to get the shit beat out of it on Monday.  

I do have some stock so I'm going to try and not look at it.  My calls are out until November so they have some time to recover.  

The absolute worst part is that Tony Stark built the other EV in a cave .... with scraps .... and it is going to finish.

2021-04-17 23:26:24,wallstreetbets,"Meh.... First time failures are not uncommon, everything is a learning curve. They entered, and they tried with an untested vehicle.

Remind me... How many rockets has Daddy Elon blown up so far? Or NASA in the 60's?"
2021-04-17 22:35:42,wallstreetbets,And they didn't test in those conditions why?
2021-04-18 07:10:15,wallstreetbets,"The problem though is that as soon as they do that, the hub motors will be destroyed"
2021-04-18 14:06:43,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the Iron Man reference was definitely fitting considering their only competition was some homebrew EV Truck using tech from a fucking Nissan Leaf.  (which is the absolutely **LAST** thing I would expect to work in the Baja 250......)

What an utter failure."
2021-04-17 23:33:16,wallstreetbets,"Sure, first time failures, and failure in general, is a reality of life. NASA still blew up a rocket in the 90s, too. 

But if you're trying to ""mass"" produce cars... Well then you should really have your prototype locked down and ready to go before figuring out how to make sales, which it definitely seems like sales are their focus.

Even if it was an issue with sitting on a tarmac before the race started (lol) what's going to happen to your everyday drivers when they're stuck waiting in traffic because of an accident?"
2021-04-17 22:36:26,wallstreetbets,That's exactly what shareholders should be asking them right now.

2021-04-17 23:42:15,wallstreetbets,"Last time I checked, they aren't mass producing cars yet.  These are ""test mules"" which are pre-production.  

I'm with you that I was expecting more than what we saw; however, there are other companies *cough* NKLA *cough* that have ZERO and even faked a truck by having it roll down a hill.  

That is a scam.

These guys (RIDE) could fail, but I am seeing them making good faith efforts to move forward.  

P.S.  Your user name checks out."
2021-04-18 01:05:53,wallstreetbets,It was a questionable decision to enter the race in the first place.  They are not manufacturing an off road truck. They chose to use an inexperienced driver.  If they had finished would the positive have outweighed the risk?

Point is unless it’s a massive conspiracy, it’s not a scam. Real humans go to work in a real factory and it’s fucking massive."
2021-04-18 01:10:45,wallstreetbets,I liked the decision.  But if you are going to enter the race...*race.* Show customers what you have. I didn't expect them to win or even finish.  I did expect them to drive the truck like they were trying to show what it is made of though. Don't drive like you're piloting the Mars Rover and still have the vehicle fail.
2021-04-18 02:03:26,wallstreetbets,"I am a bear on RIDE (closed my positions last week, so no financial interest in seeing them go down anymore) and I agree that entering this race was a very questionable move. If they did well, well it is a heavily customized truck that has little bearing on production. If it does poorly, as it did, it makes them look like clowns. I guess if it did well, you have an argument that in-wheel motors might work out, but still not sure the smartness of this move."
2021-04-18 01:03:17,wallstreetbets,"Bully for you.  However, at the speed *they* were driving over those bumps,  you could drink hot coffee."

2021-04-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLOV degenerates be careful Sigh... be careful CLOV degenerates. This high short interest stuff has already been debunked it looks like. The high short interest shown was a mistake by Factset and the short% of float is way way lower. Short interest is actually only about 35% of float, which is moderately high but not anywhere remotely close to the 145% being spread around.

1. Institutional shares like Vanguard that are counted in the post are freely tradable and are never deducted from a float calculation.
2. Clover’s publicly traded equity are Class A shares. Clover’s CEO only holds Class B shares. The screenshot shows that FactSet accidentally thought CEO Garipalli’s 83 million Class B shares were Class A shares. They were not, but because of the mistake FactSet subtracted them from the calculation of Class A float, which led to the mistakenly low number.

In other words, the screenshot of the “evidence” actually debunks this thesis.

There are about 109.8 million shares in the free float, and FactSet, Bloomberg, and Reuters are now all in agreement on that. But when FactSet subtracted 83 million from that by mistake it made it look like the float was only \~27 million (109.8 - 83) which made it look like the short interest as a % of float was massive.

FactSet corrected their numbers today. S3 Partners (which was cited in media and relied on FactSet) will likely correct next, then the handful of media articles that cited S3 (and indirectly FactSet) will probably correct as well.

There are actually a ton of shares available to short (30 million) according to IHS Markit, another short data provider. The cost to borrow is cheap at about 1.5-2%. None of this is consistent with a squeeze scenario.

Want to find high short interest names like everyone else but this is just not the one.

EDIT: S3 has now corrected their short interest based on the incorrect input from Factset, their SI% of float number has changed to 36.97% [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1384112959329247236](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1384112959329247236)

EDIT 2: IPO Edge release covers S3's change of short interest calculation over the weekend [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chamath-backed-clover-health-apparent-172941952.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chamath-backed-clover-health-apparent-172941952.html)"

2021-04-18 11:04:03,wallstreetbets,So you’re basically telling me to go all in with shares on Monday? Understood!
2021-04-18 07:40:53,wallstreetbets,"Buying 10k on Monday, thanks OP"
2021-04-18 00:12:12,wallstreetbets,"You had me at ""sigh"".  I'm in.  


3,000 shares."
2021-04-18 09:06:09,wallstreetbets,I picked up a few 5/21 $15 calls Friday morning for like $150. Plenty of upside possibility and not much downside.
2021-04-18 00:40:20,wallstreetbets,Simple question: did anyone from the CLOV DD post positions?
2021-04-17 22:29:50,wallstreetbets,"The amount of traffic CLOV is getting means I will be buying 75% in shares, 25% in like jan 2022 $15s. This is too early to be doing FDs, for everyone new."
2021-04-18 16:39:32,wallstreetbets,"Whoa, wait a min. The person that wrote this ""DD"" acct is only 2 months old. Son of a bitch, I'm in. Getting some shares and calls on monday."
2021-04-17 22:25:56,wallstreetbets,Errors were noted before after hours ended yet still up 2%.  This whole situation is so fishy.  Might chuck something at it out of fomo incase it has a bit of a run.
2021-04-17 23:56:10,wallstreetbets,I threw money at it cuz why not
2021-04-17 23:02:09,wallstreetbets,"I mean CLOV is underpriced from a fundamental level as well, so short squeeze or not, it’s a fine stock to buy."
2021-04-18 01:18:01,wallstreetbets,"Not everything is $GME I get it, theirs a lot of sentiment because of the crazy run. But isn’t it the point of this subreddit for all of us to make money? Clov is a legitimate company being implemented in 10 states and they’re hiring reputable members to its board of directors. This company is far from a scam. Let’s make money and squeeze these hedge funds"
2021-04-17 23:53:56,wallstreetbets,This will take off Monday.. I have been in and out of this stock for the last few months. It is making a similar move like Nordstrom post pandemic / summer.
2021-04-18 12:29:04,wallstreetbets,"Sorry. Don't post fake stuff 

35% isn't moderately high. It's exorbitantly high.

10% is moderately high SI. 20% is very high.

35% is massive."
2021-04-18 00:13:35,wallstreetbets,"Smells like some folks decided to let shorts/puts ride through the weekend and hoping it doesn't gap up on Monday. Even accepting that 35% is the correct number, that's more than enough for a short squeeze. The bigger danger for shorts is the massive gamma squeeze that's pending if this thing goes over $10. That option chain is incredibly loaded. Amc squeezed on less while tripling the number of outstanding shares. It's all about whether retard strength or FUD is greater in the short term."
2021-04-17 23:05:10,wallstreetbets,There’s a lot of strange stuff with zero hedge tweeting to the motley fool releasing an article for the bull case today.. also based on the sheer volume yesterday it’s safe to assume there has been another large volume of shorting happening... I’m thinking this thing definitely still has life in it.
2021-04-17 22:26:07,wallstreetbets,"The amount of “CLOV is a scam” posts I’m seeing in the past day or two makes me raise an eyebrow. Why are some people suddenly worrying about how much money internet strangers lose on a sub that revels in loss porn? Also, seeing a decent amount of anti-CLOV posts and comments on other stock related subs. 

I’m not advising that people bet the farm, but I tend to become suspicious when internet strangers all of a sudden care about other internet strangers losing money."
2021-04-18 07:54:55,wallstreetbets,I am in
2021-04-17 23:47:46,wallstreetbets,The only post/comments you’ve ever made over 82 days? 🤔
2021-04-18 14:19:49,wallstreetbets,"Once I saw an article say it was the “next GME squeeze” I bought putts when it was rising to nine. Watched it drop and bought $9 calls after I sold. Don’t know what I’m doing, just making a wallstreetbet 😅"
2021-04-18 19:05:23,wallstreetbets,Alright clov is the next squeeze guys.  Be on the watch tomm
2021-04-18 09:22:05,wallstreetbets,I think I will watch this from the sidelines and see who turned out to be right or wrong.
2021-04-18 01:36:18,wallstreetbets,$CLOV the fact that HedgeFunds has to lie and argue that CLOV isn’t heavily shorted shows how powerful we could be if we all work together! We coming! And we coming in HOT 🚀🚀🔥🔥
2021-04-18 02:32:23,wallstreetbets,All BS aside. I got a bot asking me to ask questions about $CLOV. That shit is real bro..this could be big!
2021-04-17 22:04:39,wallstreetbets,Interesting you have been on reddit 2 months. You have 3 karma and are posting DD telling people NOT to buy a stock. Seems kind of sus.
2021-04-17 21:55:20,wallstreetbets,Doesn't matter if the SI is 40% or 140% both are high. Marketcap is only 3 billion. With the amount of calls sold last week this stock is going to pop. Also S3 is still standing buy their short interest call. With the amount of interest in this stock people just have to buy and hold and shorters will have to pay.
2021-04-17 22:02:25,wallstreetbets,Just the sheer amount of people shit talking CLOV on WSB makes me think it will fly. ALWAYS inverse WSB sentiment.
2021-04-18 00:34:28,wallstreetbets,LFG clov it has been beaten down tooo much! It’s time for it to go up shorts had their fun now time to fuck em up!
2021-04-18 11:30:06,wallstreetbets,I am starting to feel some RKT vibes in here. There is probably money to be made here but many will FOMO near the top or wont sell when they should and will be left holding the bag.
2021-04-18 01:22:38,wallstreetbets,"OP's account has been created January this year, and all his posts are about convincing the crowd that CLOV's short squeeze is not happening. Bot account spotted.

2021-04-18 07:40:58,wallstreetbets,I've made some money from buying puts while it was peaking over $9 and I've got a cheap call/put spread for May.  This stock is going to be rebalancing a lot over the next few weeks.

2021-04-18 15:52:06,wallstreetbets,OPs account is bullshit
2021-04-18 16:38:15,wallstreetbets,We need better DD on this. Someone with more wrinkles that can figure out the true short interest.
2021-04-18 00:19:14,wallstreetbets,Threw a dozen shares at it. Maybe we get lucky.

The dude gives me wrong vibes."
2021-04-18 01:43:00,wallstreetbets,I’m seeing tons of new accounts pushing it so it’s super suspicious. Plus they’re now taking away our GME daily megathread? Lots of posts recently showing how people are being offered money to post non-GME DD for $100 a post. Anyone with a brain knows what’s happening here. Hold as always fellow apes.
2021-04-18 09:41:16,wallstreetbets,I hope people realize that no institution in their right minds wants to be the next Melvin. Although if you’re fully retarded enough to fomo into the “next big short squeeze” then you probably deserve to lose money lol
2021-04-18 08:56:34,wallstreetbets,"Anytime mainstream brainwashing media starts writing about “the next meme stock, the next Reditt short squeeze, the next GME,” it’s SHIELDS UP, RED ALERT!"
2021-04-18 11:44:20,wallstreetbets,"I think we’ve all learned a lot this weekend on CLOV. This post is solid. That being said I am in 120k per my YOLO post. If this gaps up on Monday, I think it will rip hard. If you look at level 2 options data there is a very high likelihood of a gamma squeeze. Some people are reporting higher SI around 40% after Friday’s activity too. Heavily shorted. Gamma squeeze. Ape force. Take me to the moon please"
2021-04-18 11:58:45,wallstreetbets,Even when you calculate the SI including Vivek's shares... after Friday's short storm .. the SI =115% 66 million shares shorted on Friday alone
2021-04-18 08:31:07,wallstreetbets,So they can just make up the short interest of a stock?? Bullish as fuh for my gameees
2021-04-18 09:26:02,wallstreetbets,It may not be the right info BUT it’s not a mistake.
2021-04-18 09:59:33,wallstreetbets,Best DD yet. Hats off to you dude. Looks like we have a $20 stock instead of a $100 stock. STILL A SQUEEZE.

CLOV is in legitimate trouble as a company.  It's impacted chamaths rreputation.  I dont own this but I do own sofi, shares and leaps, where I'm getting murdered because of the ownership and spac connection to CLOV.  

Keep in mind, two opposite opinions on a stock can be reasonable.  The new guys who don't have room in their brains for dissenting opinions can be suspicious of whatever they want but it amounts to ad hominem.

And he didn't say not to buy, just that this isn't the kind of candidate for a SS that some people are saying it is -- due to the propagation of incorrect SI figures."
2021-04-18 03:22:23,wallstreetbets,"Maybe I'm naïve, but everything doesn't have to be a conspiracy.  He, like /u/kokanuttt could really be trying to get people to avoid falling for the story pushed by the media.  There was a lot of misinformation on Friday.  Short interest is nowhere near 150%.  


I just think there are a lot of people that want the stock to go higher.  I bought since it closed near the resistance at $9 and have a stop loss set around $8.50."

2021-04-17 22:09:51,wallstreetbets,I see your point - just wondering what anyone would gain from telling peeps to not buy a stock?
2021-04-18 01:41:11,wallstreetbets,Amen brother! First gamma squeeze then short squeeze.
2021-04-17 23:08:58,wallstreetbets,S3 gets their short intrest data by factset. They are not standing by “their” call. FactSets has already changed the data.

2021-04-18 15:02:19,wallstreetbets,That is not short intrest. That is short VOLUME two completely different things and short volume is useless becuase 98% of the time MMs short stocks when the demand is going up to keep up the supply and immediately cover within a few seconds or even milliseconds. Also Vivek’s shares are not included in the 109m share float number. They never were.
2021-04-18 11:54:12,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty sure subtracting a number from the original twice instead of only once is definitely categorized as a mistake.

2021-04-18 16:30:13,wallstreetbets,"Man, not everything is FUD. It's true. The short interest was debunked. I didn't even need any DD's to tell me that. I started looking at as much info as I could after I saw some reports of 200% short interest and found that there was only one spot giving it that short interest percentage and float. it was inaccurate. Then you have all kinds of people buying all these calls and they're going to lose a ton of money. Shares is fine. The calls tho, Idk."

But the hedge fund shorts are in since 14 or 15.. they are holding and doubling down to keep this down. Especially bc this is a personal attack on chamath"
2021-04-18 03:53:35,wallstreetbets,"I have done some DD, the company acknowledges a failure to disclose a conflict of interest, there is an active class action against them that clover will probably lose, they only have enough cash flow for 7-10months of operation before any payout in respect to the class action comes out of their finances. Shareholder equity is very VERY negative (-90%)

This looks like a short all the way down company to me because they'll hit bankruptcy and shorters will get a 100% return.

What is wsb seeing that I'm not? What article have I missed? Buying and holding here looks like putting your head in the guillotine?

Vanguard purchase? That looks like collateral to loan shorters to drive it even further down, vanguard would be collecting fees, this looks like hedging to me."

2021-04-18 07:34:35,wallstreetbets,Are you saying he's lying about Op only having 3 comments? What exactly is he asking to be trusted with? He's not providing any type of DD.
2021-04-18 09:32:06,wallstreetbets,"That's a whataboutism.

If someone comes around saying a volcano is about to erupt and the town should evacuate based on data they've collected from various Facebook groups, then someone else says hey who are you again? You just show up here and tell us a volcano is about to erupt?

You don't go after the person asking who the doomsday prophet is, you look into the person claiming doom and gloom.

Same thing is going on here. OP's account is highly sus. It doesn't take a genius or someone with over 100k karma to point that out, so why would you trash someone for pointing out the obvious?"
2021-04-18 12:18:23,wallstreetbets,"Yeah man it's fine for you to feel that way.  A lot of serious investors agree with you on that.

For me, I won't touch it because I don't like that they're so dependent on the government, which is currently suing them.  But I will admit I am not fully up to date on that.  I just don't like it personally."

Which OP did not do, it should be noted.  He's trying to bring rationality to the discussion, and the responses are that he's sus, but nobody bothers to explain why he's wrong."

10% would be considered moderately high. 20% is very high.

This guy with a new account and 1 comment sure seems fishy when he is trying to make fake claims about 35% SI being only somewhat high.

2021-04-18 17:40:42,wallstreetbets,">Short volume is ultimately SI. Sure mm's short and cover.. but not in the millions. Or even half that. 

Almost every trade that you make goes through a Market Maker. If that market maker does not have a seller on the other side lined up, they will short the stock by selling it to you. Then, when a buyer comes along, they will cover by buying shares from the seller for just a little lower (maybe .005% lower) than what you sold it to them. That is how market making works. On the flip side if a seller came along with no respective buyer, the Market Maker will use their own funds to buy the shares and then sell back at slightly higher. That is how market making works. Apple has almost 17% of its daily volume as shorts. Does that mean Apple's short interest goes up by tens of millions of shares every day?? No it does not. Same thing goes here, sure a couple (maybe 5% max) of the shares that were shorted yesterday could have turned into actual shorts. Also keep in mind that almost every trade made by retail goes through a Market Maker and more than 80% of all trades are executed by algorithms.

Short Volume is NOT ultimately Short Intrest, in fact, those two things are hardly related and are hardly correlated. If you have any doubts look up short volume of other stocks such as $AAPL and any other blue chips and see how Short interest and short volume relate there: It is not how you think.

Here is a quote from Finra, the source of Short Interest and Short Volume,

>Some market participants mistakenly conclude that the bi-monthly short interest data is understated because the Daily File reflects short sale volume that is much larger than what is reported as short interest. However, short interest data reflects short positions held by market participants at a specific moment in time on two discrete days each month, while the Daily File reflects the aggregate volume of trades executed as short sales on each trade date. Therefore, while the two data sets are related (i.e., short sale volume may ultimately result in a reportable short interest position), they are not necessarily correlated.  
>  
>  
>  
>For example, if a firm sells short 1,000 shares of security ABCD, then purchases 1,000 shares of ABCD later the same day, the short sale volume in the Daily File will include the 1,000 shares that were sold short. Because the firm sold short and purchased an equivalent number of shares that day, it did not establish or accumulate a short position in ABCD; thus, its short sale has no impact on the reported short interest in ABCD.

I'm interested to see where you see the company acknowledged a failure to disclose a conflict of interest.  I read their response to the short sellers letter.  Didn't see any such acknowledgement."
2021-04-18 11:00:09,wallstreetbets,"Yes, the company that multiplied in value by 6 after he took it public.  I know this is a foreign concept to a lot of you, but the opposite side of paper hands is the part where you take profit.  I would say 6X your money in a matter of months is a pretty good price target and profit, especially considering what happened to the stock afterward.  If something is overvalued, if you can identify that, even if you are an initial investor, there is nothing wrong with selling a stock, that is the goal here and it seems like a solid investment plan.  A lot of people on this forum specifically would be wise to understand this very basic investing concept."

2021-04-18 11:45:42,wallstreetbets,"No buddy, it's pointing out that he's a hypocrite. 

A whataboutism refers to pointing to a third party, not accusing the same person of hypocrisy.

And considering his only argument/evidence was the accounts age, his argument can be dismissed by ""evidence"" with the same weight (i.e: his own account age)

Your volcano example isn't equivalent at all. Firstly, both of these guys just showed up and neither is more trustworthy than the other. More importantly, the first guy showed his reasoning while the second guy just goes around saying ""What if he has ulterior motives?! He just showed up!"". His entire argument is moot because he doesn't address the claim *at all* and his only appeal, trying to attack the person saying it, applies to him equally.

And I pointed out the obvious because that same guy has been all over the place making paranoid claims like this, this isn't the first one. So yeah, I would like to point out that this guy is a hypocrite just trying to stir up shit.

Edit: Also, Facebook groups? You are aware that his claim is and was verifiable, right? Where exactly do you get the idea that ""info from Facebook groups"" is a good analogy?"
2021-04-18 13:09:55,wallstreetbets,"Eh no worries man. I would never hold that against you. However, From the sHoRt rEpOrt "" Department of Justice (DOJ), which is investigating at least 12 issues ranging from kickbacks to marketing practices to undisclosed third-party deals, according to a Civil Investigative Demand (similar to a subpoena) we obtained."" To begin with investigations either lead to charges or they don't. Even if they do they may not be criminal. That's just the gov being the middle man, it is expected. Same shit happened with Aphria when Health Canada was investigating the quality of their product. 

The other thing that part similar to a subopena is a loaded statement. Why word it like that? A subopena is a fucking subopena, To cause FUD. The report is poorly written IMO. Combine this with the fact that they are ramping up hiring despite it I feel more confident in it.

EDIT:
The response is worth a read to and far better than the short report IMO. A CEO isn't going to make statements to perpetuate a scam. That will get you fucked by the SEC and DOJ."

2021-04-18 05:01:51,wallstreetbets,"Disclaimer: This is not financial advise, I'm a random on the internet feeling more bearish than bullish on this stock, seeking to understand why wsb is bullish.

Here: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521029637/d66346dex991.htm

>1. Did Chamath and/or Clover know about the ongoing DOJ investigation? If so, why was it concealed from investors?

>Chamath and Clover were fully aware of the DOJ inquiry.

>To be clear, Clover does not believe it is, or has been, in violation of any rules or regulations related to the inquiry.

>We went through both an IPO and de-SPAC due diligence process, and this subject received extensive focus and attention. Consistent with the views of Clover’s outside counsel, Social Capital’s outside counsel, and independently retained outside counsel of third parties, including IPO underwriters’ counsel, we concluded that the fact of DOJ’s request for information was not material and was not required to be specifically disclosed in our SEC filings.


Per best practice if it's a question as part of an IPO you disclose it to prevent this exact issue coming up. If courts find that it needed to be disclosed clover will lose a class action, which will impact their operating capital, they do not have much and frankly do not have many resources to contest this as the firm bringing the case is legitimate and not a small shop.


Another issue is regarding revenue income sources of clover and the ownership of Seek Insurance.

>5. Clover’s subsidiary, Seek Insurance, claims on its website “We don’t work for insurance companies. We work for you” despite literally being owned by Clover, an insurance company. What is your response?

>While Seek is an affiliate, as we said, it operates separately from Clover, with its own financing and its own goals, which are to provide neutral, objective advice to Medicare eligibles and to empower, educate and assist them.

If inadequate seperation is found (extremely likely, seek has falsely presented itself and is 33-66% owned and controlled by clover) clover will potentially lose one of its better long-term exposure and recruitment methods (13.5% of seek insurance transactions wind up with clover).

Lastly there is some potential funny business with B&H and the DOJ is investigating illegal kickbacks, this shit if true sinks companies.


>6. How much has Clover paid B&H Assurance, the undisclosed outside brokerage firm run by Hiram Bermudez (its Head of Sales) since inception?

>Clover has paid approximately $160k directly to B&H since 2017.

>7. What portion of Clover’s business has been referred by B&H Assurance since inception? How many members?

>Approximately 8,200 of our current members were referred by B&H Assurance to Clover.

Sections 8 & 9 seem extremely dodgy to me, this needed full disclosure at IPO imho and should never have been a thing or question in a formal enquiry.

This reads very much like he said she said, my takeaway is that it's an artifact of kickbacks and/or an attempt to hide a conflicting relationship thinly veiled by a ""how dare you suggest that"" defence.

There are some further revenue discrepancies and product uptake concerns in section 12, the public statement is ""92% of onboarded physicians use our kit"" is shit. Section 12 discloses actual use of their software is 22% of physicians. That's a 5th of the uptake than previously disclosed. Ignoring their damage control number (22% of physicians its intended for use are live) the actual factual number is 4% of their staff are live on the platform. This undermines the shit out of section 11 where they state they don't upcode as the platform isn't meant for upcoding. Upcoding been another item they're been investigated for doing.


Tldr: They look dodgy as fuck, their financials could very well take a massive hit due to real and valid litigation and ROE is rediculously bad for them as even a short term pick. 

36% short is high but I don't think there will be much of a squeeze as I don't believe they're a viable business with this much bullshit lined up against them.

I also think this time the shorts are hedged properly, to use GME as an example that was 140% short, this is only 36%. And vanguard owns 18% of it, that's 50% of the current short volume they can loan for fees to short sellers to reduce exposure.

If vanguard affiliates own short positions they've already covered 50% of their positions.

Yes there is potential but I think the rocket will blow up on the platform or fizzle."

2021-04-18 13:26:20,wallstreetbets,"I think the major implication from the report was that Chamath had to have known about the investigation before the SPAC merger as he was doing his own due diligence, but never disclosed it to investors.  Without that report the issue wouldn't have come to light.  And if there are charges that come from the investigation, it will be a big deal.

I will say that I had a client go to prison for fraud, following a long DOJ investigation, for something similar to what is being alleged here.  Sometimes they're nothing, and sometimes they're something.  It should have been disclosed.

But I gotta admit, if it turns out to be nothing, what a buying opportunity this would be."

2021-04-18 05:56:04,wallstreetbets,"Assuming the companies response is valid, the DOJ question is null.  Are any class-action suits brought up by companies that don't have the resources to follow through?  Honestly, it's the most WS thing I've seen.  File a class action.  Lawyers make millions, shareholders get .001/shr.  


The issue with Seek seems like a non-issue to me.  They received 13% of the revenue generated by Seek.  If it were closer to 70%, yeah, that'd be a red flag.  But most of their business went to non-affiliated companies.  Hard to prove, IMO.  


The B&H seems the most likely to disappear.  And it seems you think so too since you didn't even include their response.  If nothing else, it would be a small fine and a slap.    


I'll look into their other revenue discrpeancies later.  In the short term, I think this goes higher.

Other than that.  I don't think you're quite a ""random on the internet"".  You got some cynical talents I don't have.  Despite my general bearish sentiment, I think every company is trying to do well.  You got a different take on things."

If Chelsea already owns stock shorting it down to shit isn't helpful to her, why would it happen if you don't think ""they"" wouldn't punish a clinton?

If she is looking at entering and the shorts were to make that more appealing we're already there as it's down 50%~ since IPO. Any purchases to rebound is just making more bag holders for her exit right?

In this hypothetical if the goal is to make the company successful, why is it been shorted?

A simple explanation is that it's a house of cards, Clinton as the insider knows this and they're shorting it because it will go bankrupt and they'll exit without needing to cover a single position.

1) We have a normal treadmill that I just took a look at and it has a solid bottom underneath that would have prevented the same kind of accident from happening.  Note that there's still potential for catching your face/fingers between the belt and plastic for damage which brings me to...

2) Where the fuck are the parents?  These aren't toys for kids, it's exercise equipment and can be very dangerous as we've just seen.

With that said, I think I'm going to sell off my PTON position, maybe buy some puts, until they decide to address this and I'm considering sending back the tread+ if they resist a safety recall since I'm still within 30 days."

2021-04-18 13:25:27,wallstreetbets,Bloomberg: PTON shares surge on news that their faulty treadmill design is only responsible for one death since launch
2021-04-18 01:38:54,wallstreetbets,"Still, the parents should've been watching them. Treadmills are not  intended to be used by children, let alone unsupervised."
2021-04-18 14:39:27,wallstreetbets,It has a safety key. 100% parents fault. It’s like if they left their Tesla on and unlocked in their garage and the kids end up putting it through the wall.
2021-04-18 17:48:03,wallstreetbets,Every other treadmill (including MUCH cheaper ones) already have a little guard that prevents this. They did this in the 80s after a bunch of these accidents got media attention. Apparently these guys didn't hire anyone that knows anything about treadmills to design this.
2021-04-18 03:20:39,wallstreetbets,Agreed
2021-04-18 07:52:46,wallstreetbets,No bonus for him!
2021-04-18 00:20:39,wallstreetbets,How tf u kno I was murrican?
2021-04-18 00:19:28,wallstreetbets,"Sure but if I was a papa to an absolute retard, I would take the opportunity to scold and teach my child instead of trying to take advantage of our absolutely shitfaced legal system.

Unless my kid dies or becomes vegetative. Then, fuck everyone else."
2021-04-18 19:15:37,wallstreetbets,"No, I'm morbidly obese. Why the fuck would you assume I am capable of using a treadmill?"
2021-04-18 15:49:38,wallstreetbets,"> apples to oranges

But you can still compare them."
2021-04-18 04:45:11,wallstreetbets,"It's not about being awesome or not. Buy it, keep it loaded with kids around, and when some kid starts playing with it, blame the manufacturer."
2021-04-18 04:44:01,wallstreetbets,"Yeah retard, go buy the dip on Monday when all assholes will be dumping stock. I'll be doing exactly that."
2021-04-18 08:46:00,wallstreetbets,Subscription model is where all the huge money is At !
2021-04-18 16:55:20,wallstreetbets,Don’t blow your load all at once. Split it up into chunks and average in over a week or so
2021-04-18 10:55:07,wallstreetbets,don't underestimate the status recognition of a top brand
2021-04-18 05:22:52,wallstreetbets,Jonestown had a better punchline.
2021-04-18 06:46:18,wallstreetbets,Thats so fcked up. Was not expecting to see that.
2021-04-18 05:55:28,wallstreetbets,Wow
2021-04-18 07:55:05,wallstreetbets,That kid died??
2021-04-18 12:44:36,wallstreetbets,"That.... is wow ....but um, I mean.... parents shouldn't leave their kids alone with a working treadmill in the same way parents should be extra cautious with kids if a swimming pool is nearby.

As a father of 2 young ones myself, I'd never leave my kids alone in a room with a pluged-in treadmill. And, IIRC, don't treadmills have some kind of ""key"" that has to be inserted before it can come  on? I'd take that key out of the room AND unplug it if I'm not there actively using it."
2021-04-17 21:49:49,wallstreetbets,A child actually died from this :( this kid got lucky the ball was there.
2021-04-17 21:41:35,wallstreetbets,Kid is a beast. He wormed his way out
2021-04-18 08:38:33,wallstreetbets,I thought this is the video about the kid dying. I couldnt watch it till the end. I rewatched it after seeing the comments here. Thank fucking God he didnt die
2021-04-18 00:10:17,wallstreetbets,Damnnn... so yea I guess time to short PTON monday...
2021-04-18 10:32:09,wallstreetbets,I think a couple of the cases had the children supervised (the parents were the ones using it) and the kid approached from behind and got pulled under
2021-04-18 00:11:50,wallstreetbets,Yea true... but def puts on PTON though.
2021-04-18 01:45:39,wallstreetbets,"Regardless, it's a potentially dangerous common household piece of heavy machinery. If they can do something to prevent/protect from this, they should. A child is a vulrenable individual, they don't deserve to die because of their careless or distracted parents."
2021-04-18 08:25:28,wallstreetbets,Of course it will. And they will get $50 million or whatever number from Peleton and the users who suffered a loss (injury) will get a few thousand if they are lucky.
2021-04-18 01:52:07,wallstreetbets,"You're also not meant to crash your car, but manufacturers still have a duty to install airbags in every car.

This design is negligent and it will be proven in court."
2021-04-18 02:17:21,wallstreetbets,">Unless my kid dies or becomes vegetative.  Then, fuck everyone else.

So.. kinda like what happened with this situation?"
2021-04-18 05:28:28,wallstreetbets,Sue them to the ground. Legal system is good for this.
2021-04-18 15:52:24,wallstreetbets,I can't tell if you're trying to be funny or if you're just dumb.
2021-04-18 04:47:27,wallstreetbets,Lmao sounds like you shouldn’t have a gun at all
2021-04-18 08:51:12,wallstreetbets,"If you can't reinvent the wheel, make it shiny and force them to pay to use it."
2021-04-18 18:31:21,wallstreetbets,This was actually really great advice. Thank you sir! 🦍🍌
2021-04-18 11:58:49,wallstreetbets,"Branding is primarily something that people show off, if it's  a product kept at home and hardly seen by others it's easily substituted"
2021-04-18 09:45:04,wallstreetbets,no different video
2021-04-18 18:54:58,wallstreetbets,"After reading about Mike Tyson’s daughter dying on a treadmill, I hid the key to mine. Also turned mine facing away from the wall so my girl can’t come up behind me without me seeing"
2021-04-18 15:42:17,wallstreetbets,Why doesn't the treadmill sense a jam in the rotation and shut off.  That poor kid.
2021-04-18 15:41:48,wallstreetbets,">those fuckers had the treadmill and the bike,  sucks to say but I know some of them personally. some of these old money given to them type of wealthy people dont give a shit about their kids"
2021-04-17 23:36:24,wallstreetbets,Not today satan!
2021-04-18 19:57:41,wallstreetbets,"How do we short the parents that leave their children unsupervised with working exercise equipment?

Edit: To clarify there are keys that prevent the equipment from working."
2021-04-18 10:37:12,wallstreetbets,"In that case, might be PTONs fault. But any injury relating to a child actually using a treadmill falls mostly on the parents IMO"
2021-04-18 02:05:45,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-18 06:29:48,wallstreetbets,"There's a safety key that's supposed to be ""removed and out of reach of children"" (< exact wording from the safety warning) when not in use.

 There literally is a safety feature for shit like this but from what I've seen, most people don't bother doing it."
2021-04-18 10:05:26,wallstreetbets,"True. And I’m not arguing in support of Peloton, because it should have a damn guard, But where’s the line? The treadmill can be dangerous but so can countless others household products to a toddler. Blaming products for shitty parents just promotes shitty parenting. 

That being said, buy the dip. It’s still a good company."
2021-04-18 01:59:56,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm not denying that peloton carries some responsibility. But so do the parents. Whether they will win in court or not is not what I'm stating
2021-04-18 13:20:08,wallstreetbets,"I dunno where you've been for the last decade but people show off on social media now

broadcasting that you're working out or fit is one thing but it's entirely another to broadcast that you're a part of some kind of fitness tribe

hashtags are social movements and social movements drive brand recognition, which drives sales"
2021-04-18 07:30:44,wallstreetbets,Ok thanos. Wanna start with yourself?
2021-04-18 09:44:23,wallstreetbets,Yeah how dare these children not read the service manual and securely attach the service key to their pullups
2021-04-18 15:48:01,wallstreetbets,">But where’s the line? 

The line is that treadmills have been around forever and Peloton designers were more retarded than the retards here for not creating a product with the same safety design that $100 tread mills have. 

IMO peloton can get fucked just like they fuck customers with their absurdly priced designer equipment."
2021-04-18 02:03:25,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough. Parents have the ultimate responsibility, of course. It's their kid. No arguments there."
2021-04-18 10:24:34,wallstreetbets,I think he means it’s on the parents to remove the key when they’re not using it.
2021-04-18 11:51:43,wallstreetbets,"The other guy is correct, nobody here is even remotely blaming the kids for not connecting the safety key, that's all in your interpretation.

I suspect you didn't actually finish reading my comment though, because nowhere in it did the part about attaching the key to yourself while in use actually come up."
2021-04-18 17:19:18,wallstreetbets,Ok
2021-04-18 11:48:23,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you're correct.

...I don't have any idea what the fuck that guy's thought process must have looked like to reach the conclusion that I'm blaming the kid."

2021-04-18 17:12:53,wallstreetbets,This is the quality content I paid for🦧👙
2021-04-18 10:05:46,wallstreetbets,AMC is 5.7b dollars in debt with a 15% interest rate on that debt I could see the company failing within the next couple years unless they could figure something out repay all that debt. You all might think I’m being a bay sayer but I don’t see a short squeeze happening they have over 400 million outstanding shares available. Pretty hard for a short squeeze to happen with that. Don’t get me wrong I got 10 shares just in case something happens but gme is the king of meme stocks amc is just the stock that gets you away from gme just my theory to the people owning hundreds of shares I hope it does you well.
2021-04-17 20:24:28,wallstreetbets,"No fair, you have more shares then me"

2021-04-18 07:29:04,wallstreetbets,You fucking dumbass. Wake up before it’s too late. AMC literally can go to 100 in nearly an instant as soon as one hedge gets margin called. Don’t be a hard headed fucker and miss out

2021-04-17 21:35:50,wallstreetbets,Troll kings can *obfuscate* at a moments notice. This one will probably let you do the electronic sliding dance technique.
2021-04-18 15:25:48,wallstreetbets,"My wish is $100, realistically this week $13++"
2021-04-18 08:27:18,wallstreetbets,"I'm not missing out, im on gme and not a retard, you are missing out by being on amc."
2021-04-18 13:22:36,wallstreetbets,😉
2021-04-18 10:04:00,wallstreetbets,Did you even watch the Interview with the CEO?
2021-04-18 09:36:36,wallstreetbets,I prefer the au naturale
2021-04-18 07:21:25,wallstreetbets,Abba what? Sir this is Wendy's not Stanford.
2021-04-18 09:33:49,wallstreetbets,"What the fuck is with this shit. Buy GME, buy AMC, who fuckin cares, by BOTH! They’ll both do well. Bitching and fighting over GME/ AMC when we’re all just trying to make some money here. *nowhere in the ballpark of being financial advice*"
2021-04-18 12:11:21,wallstreetbets,You mean the one where he said they wouldn’t dilute right this minute t at any time in the future? Yes I did and amc holders are atupid
2021-04-18 09:55:21,wallstreetbets,Apes together strong my fellow apes 🦧
2021-04-18 16:31:48,wallstreetbets,"Indeed!  I will say this though, if I had $140k in AMC that would only be because I have $500k in GME."
2021-04-18 10:19:42,wallstreetbets,YAAS! I like all short squeezes. Let’s go team!
2021-04-18 12:32:00,wallstreetbets,First of all you should wait for the share holders meeting when it comes to dilution and even if the vote passes there has been an official SEC filing about not diluting the stock any more in 2021. The CEO could dilute the stock tomorrow with 43mil shares outstanding from another vote but why should he do this while AMC is sitting pretty in the moment. I feel you are an GME ape but really no need to hate each other because both stock will moon. 🦍🦧
2021-04-18 12:38:19,wallstreetbets,Ima a me ape and I think amc is fucking stupid. It’s not a moon stock and I’ll bet 200 bucks to charity that it never breaks 35 by years end
2021-04-18 12:41:09,wallstreetbets,Even 35$ would be 700% gains for me. I will take it anyways. Good luck on your positions and stay positive my fellow ape.
2021-04-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,SPY 6/19 $420 LEAPs - bought for $0.69. 1100% Gain 
2021-04-17 23:20:54,wallstreetbets,If I bought 5 spy leaps The Great Depression part deux would begin tomorrow.
2021-04-17 20:38:33,wallstreetbets,Finally someone who gained from spy

2021-04-17 22:38:29,wallstreetbets,Good enough to screenshot....

2021-04-17 23:08:36,wallstreetbets,*type* **MARGIN**
2021-04-18 02:56:26,wallstreetbets,But the real profit was the Reddit rewards reaped by this post 😆
2021-04-18 05:32:59,wallstreetbets,What app do you use?
2021-04-17 20:39:27,wallstreetbets,Hope you are cashing this soon.  It is possible we go to $452 on a measured move but we are at very dangerous levels to be long much. Our schools just got shut down again. We are on Wave 3 up from the low and sometimes that wave can get truncated.
2021-04-17 20:17:07,wallstreetbets,How does this work? Cam somebody explain? Soryyyyy
2021-04-17 20:04:23,wallstreetbets,"Weird, I don't see the $420 strike for 2021-06-18 calls on Schwab.

Edit: Sorry I annoyed you by not being able to find the option you listed."

2021-04-17 23:21:58,wallstreetbets,Just an ape here.. what are LEAPs?
2021-04-17 23:38:09,wallstreetbets,"If you just put more money into them, would be grate! Nice call btw! 😎👍😭"
2021-04-18 01:30:31,wallstreetbets,"Nice, wish I did the same."
2021-04-18 04:15:49,wallstreetbets,"How long ago did you buy these?
I've started buying $500 calls for January.

Edit..
I read further down."
2021-04-18 04:21:56,wallstreetbets,Why doesn’t he have the all seeing eye award yet
2021-04-18 05:18:48,wallstreetbets,When you are up with options do you continue to hold until the expiration date or can you sale out of it anytime?
2021-04-18 05:23:28,wallstreetbets,You have gotten the picture by this point. Invest in something worth a damn like defi.
2021-04-18 06:16:29,wallstreetbets,Ya I’m pretty chapped I bought so much further out date wise. My gain was much less.
2021-04-18 07:57:11,wallstreetbets,Nice! I need a good swing like that! I'll use the gains to buy more AMC🚀🚀
2021-04-18 08:01:46,wallstreetbets,this guy is way too powerful

2021-04-18 10:41:32,wallstreetbets,"Dam, I wish I was you right now! 
Did you have protection in case the trade went south? 
Or were you YOLO'ing it?"
2021-04-18 11:08:54,wallstreetbets,Still intrinsically worth $0!
2021-04-18 11:30:25,wallstreetbets,This gives me hope for my 2022 500c
2021-04-18 11:42:00,wallstreetbets,Why not the 69 expiration? Lol
2021-04-18 11:57:13,wallstreetbets,Me proud 🦍
2021-04-18 12:08:07,wallstreetbets,How tf did you get that for .69?

2021-04-18 19:41:30,wallstreetbets,"I just have the two in my hands... oh wait, you meant the “stocks”?  I don’t have any either."
2021-04-17 20:15:43,wallstreetbets,Not gme?....not interested
2021-04-17 21:03:58,wallstreetbets,"These aren't leaps, but who's counting"
2021-04-17 22:08:40,wallstreetbets,"Maybe a dumb question, but he can sell contracts at anytime for profit or does have to buy the shares?"
2021-04-17 21:10:35,wallstreetbets,You probably thought of 4/19?
2021-04-18 10:33:35,wallstreetbets,What are LEAPS?
2021-04-18 10:19:57,wallstreetbets,Why don’t you do that? Take one for the team. Everyone else can get puts.
2021-04-17 20:50:42,wallstreetbets,Same. I wonder what would have happened if the May 212 puts I bought (2020) were May 412 calls 2021. I don't want to do the math. I had 80k in it. LMAO
2021-04-17 20:06:28,wallstreetbets,Let’s get shwiftyyy
2021-04-18 15:39:11,wallstreetbets,You mean aside from the 90% of Americans that have it in their 401k?

2021-04-18 05:27:07,wallstreetbets,Ive always heard if it’s worth taking a screenshot it’s worth selling
2021-04-17 22:36:58,wallstreetbets,I'd say what til 4/20 but that's because I'll be getting high as fuck that day while i cheer on my spy positions

2021-04-17 22:40:44,wallstreetbets,How many are you holding?
2021-04-17 21:00:48,wallstreetbets,"I almost bought that expiration, but I wanted to be sure it included april 20, 2021, so I went with June. my DD game is strong. fear me."
2021-04-17 20:56:34,wallstreetbets,No masks in schools here govenor and buisnesses cant mandate them either
2021-04-18 06:18:42,wallstreetbets,Where you at bro
2021-04-17 20:38:12,wallstreetbets,"Gambling. 292 days ago, OP looked at the latest options available and saw some going 0.69/contract with a $420 strike price and thought to himself “hurr durr, 420-69” and bought those options. He bet that the economy would be up 50% in less than half a year. 

His bet paid off."

Buying options with expirations far out in the future, ideally with high deltas (.7+) giving you similar returns to owning 100 shares of the underlying for (ideally) a lot less than actually going long 100 shares."
2021-04-18 08:26:24,wallstreetbets,I’ve got 1k shares of AMC. They’re currently underwater.
2021-04-18 11:31:23,wallstreetbets,Nope. I put in $350 and have been waiting.
2021-04-18 11:44:58,wallstreetbets,"The 6/9 expiration didn't exist when I bought these. At the time, this was the first expiration after 4/20/2021."
2021-04-17 20:17:39,wallstreetbets,I went all in on GME at $17 :)
2021-04-18 02:52:33,wallstreetbets,It literally is exactly that. Do you know what a LEAPS is?
2021-04-17 22:10:16,wallstreetbets,Yes. The contract itself can be traded.
2021-04-17 21:11:38,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, let's go with that."
2021-04-17 20:01:27,wallstreetbets,"Nice, great job dude!"

2021-04-18 04:19:01,wallstreetbets,"Ouch, fuck it, youll make 160k"
2021-04-17 20:18:38,wallstreetbets,Shit on the flooooooor!
2021-04-17 21:51:59,wallstreetbets,Opposite would be that they sold the calls. Rather than buying the calls
2021-04-18 00:06:31,wallstreetbets,"Haha you’re looking too far into my comment! It was satire, purposefully not supposed to make any sense cuz am ape on wsb 🦍🦍🦍"
2021-04-18 00:12:51,wallstreetbets,Thanks! It was a dumb bet. But it’s a dumb market. 🥳
2021-04-18 15:14:07,wallstreetbets,yeah honestly everyone thought the market was done with its bull run when spy dropped 20 points in like a second
2021-04-17 20:59:01,wallstreetbets,"I bought these on June 30, 2020. the bull market had been going for a while by then, but had been dipping recently."
2021-04-17 23:46:00,wallstreetbets,Yes but boasting about it is in bad taste. And the new mutant varient is killing people in their 20s and 30s. Lost a cousin that way.
2021-04-18 05:07:03,wallstreetbets,You bought these 10 months ago? What was spy trading at then?
2021-04-17 20:37:59,wallstreetbets,Just more proof you gotta meme yourself to win.
2021-04-17 22:32:16,wallstreetbets,Yes...this strategy...will adopt
2021-04-18 08:49:27,wallstreetbets,Clever DD
2021-04-17 21:11:52,wallstreetbets,"Why does everyone act like you gotta ride all the options together? I'd sell some to secure profits, then set trailing stop losses on most of the rest to protect profits."
2021-04-17 20:52:53,wallstreetbets,100% is it better to have ANY gains rather than turn towards straight up gambling territory. Don’t be greedy: higher return = WONDERFUL!!! But I too would rake in the promised profit!!

My area is seeing big problems with vaccinated people still getting infected. I have SPY PUTS that I bought on FRIDAY as they were super cheap and the $VIX put in a perfect bottoming pattern.  MAR puts too as that hotel stock is in big trouble. See what happens next. Very risky time to be long a market that has went up this much on hope alone.

2021-04-17 21:26:30,wallstreetbets,I got them literally before closing bell on Friday. That’s what I consider a “yolo” trade. I’m actually down too but I’m not worried because I basically bought past the theta. It’s just a tiny cheap swing trade.
2021-04-17 23:31:47,wallstreetbets,Yeah there’s no in app setting which is retarded
2021-04-18 02:49:54,wallstreetbets,Around here people do weeklies which is a fantastic way to lose your money in record time. LEAPS are generally considered months to years out. As far as selling 30-45 days is what I’ve heard to be when time decay really starts to set in and the contract rapidly loses value.
2021-04-18 06:11:02,wallstreetbets,Teach me
2021-04-18 09:42:25,wallstreetbets,Teach me2
2021-04-18 14:02:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, ""buying past theta"" is not a thing and doesn't mean anything. You may be a bit confused. Theta is essentially the time decay on your options price. I suggest you read up on the greeks because people trading options who don't even understand the greeks never ends well."
2021-04-18 10:43:40,wallstreetbets,What do you mean by bought past the theta?
2021-04-18 11:10:53,wallstreetbets,30-45 days before it expires? Thanks
2021-04-18 17:59:33,wallstreetbets,"You can totally buy past theta!

...just buy stock lol"
2021-04-18 15:02:06,wallstreetbets,The theta is below a dollar moron. You can’t lose fractional pennys on options. It’s at .0026... the analysis has the same break even whether I sold on Friday or Monday.
2021-04-18 15:12:01,wallstreetbets,"Yeah so I just had a little exchange with him regarding ""bought past theta"" and it turns out he's just a retard and thinks he has no theta left to lose on that option (which is entirely incorrect). So he's just a moron. Gg"
2021-04-18 10:50:49,wallstreetbets,"If you put it in an analysis tool you’ll see what I’m saying... it’s an option trader thing, you wouldn’t understand."

2021-04-18 18:01:50,wallstreetbets,"Lol that's true


Reminds me of some comment I read in here recently ""hey guys I found this new kind of options contract that has a delta of 1 and no expiration date!! Freaking crazy right??"""
2021-04-18 15:09:28,wallstreetbets,"Wow yeah so you actually are a retard. No buddy, I'm looking at it rn and the theta is -0.2924. You really need to read up on the greeks because you clearly have no clue wtf you're doing. Good luck."
2021-04-18 15:15:52,wallstreetbets,Thanks for clarifying
2021-04-18 10:52:20,wallstreetbets,I trade options regularly. I've just never seen that phrase before. What analysis tool do you suggest?

I use thinkorswim... but there’s free ones like option profit calculator. It’s just time consuming to put in all the data whereas ToS is just a right click and updates in real time."
2021-04-18 15:17:36,wallstreetbets,"Ok so then you understand when the theta is -.29 you lose 29 cents per day per share per options contract simply through the passage of time? So you didn't ""buy past theta"" when there is still theta left to lose. If you have 0 theta then it is expiration. What aren't you getting about this?"
2021-04-18 16:11:10,wallstreetbets,"""Theta decay is factored into the friday closing price, but it's offset with by an increase in the implied volatility. The market maker “prices in” weekend risk through a volatility adjustment, and does not allow the option to change in value over the weekend from theta."""
2021-04-18 16:18:33,wallstreetbets,"Oh, so you bought those options contracts AFTER market close on Friday? Nice, the rest of us normies can only trade options within market hours.

Edit: not to mention the actual loss of theta on expiration date itself. But yeah bro, u have no more theta left to lose. Gl with that"
2021-04-18 16:32:14,wallstreetbets,"No, read it again. Theta is priced in..."
2021-04-18 16:45:50,wallstreetbets,"... It's priced in, from Friday close to Monday open. Lol. Duh?"
2021-04-18 16:58:20,wallstreetbets,That is my point... I just worded it differently.

Up another $30K, decided to borrow more another $90K to buy more stocks, re-leverage back up like the strategy demands and post a quick update

Every post, I tell WSBs that this strategy still has excellent potential (smart-beta and stocks are still looking quite attractive). Every post, a smooth-brained idiot tells me smart-beta is dead, that this only makes money in bull markets (the last 220 years are not enough evidence apparently..), etc. And every time, I ignore them, follow the strategy (buying stocks if needed) and it continues to deliver.

Also, saw so much loss porn yesterday. Was a WSB lurker for years, used to be this site was about smart but risky DDs, and ballsy bets with good potential. Who can forget the legendary thesmd AMD updates from 2019? Now it's only about retards who lose money for a living with options they don't understand, and holding a stock just because they bought it higher and everyone else does too. It's not ""diamond hands"" dumbass, that's called ""sunk cost fallacy"".

If you've lost enough money to realize trading is like a casino, and want to make money again, WSB old-school style, well, this strategy STILL has plenty of potential to go."

So you use 100k of your money and 100k loan. You invest 40% in etf‘s, 40% in spy puts and 20% remains in cash just in case you get a margin call. Your profit is the arbitrage between the etf and spy performance as i understood.

At the end max profit, max tax reduction for US people with minimizing the risk.

But this requires that the selected stocks and the spy puts do have a negative correlation, when these changes too much, then you would have to reposition"

2021-04-18 04:14:33,wallstreetbets,"Was one of your \~10 original upvoters. Always look forward to the updates. Keep letting your portfolio construction and chosen leverage speak for themselves.

I never understand why people on here who roll 10-100x leverage in weeklies, week after week until they blow up, always get so scared of something like this or a simple Boglehead Hedgefundie 3x risk-parity strategy.

Maybe the future will be good to you, maybe not, but the amount of ignorant fear every time you post is strange (too much leverage! beta decay!).  There was that one guy a few months back who really lit into you who had some valid points from the perspective of large-money management, but compared to what others here are doing.... 

They'd pretty much all be better served just picking some factors, leveraging somewhere between 1 and 4 times adjusted according to volatility and bands, and otherwise rebalancing once a year, and never looking at a chart."

2021-04-17 21:07:47,wallstreetbets,It literally can’t go tits up?
2021-04-17 22:02:37,wallstreetbets,"It looks like I actually use a similar strategy: Heavy leverage (50% of unleveraged portfolio value), all the margin money invested in boring, diversified stocks and indexes.  Unlevered money in whatever shit I actually want.

As long as the levered money makes more than interest (2.5%), it's free money.  As long as I'm far from my maintenance value, margin call risk is very low."

2021-04-18 05:01:43,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for all the info , really looking forward for the in depth guide!
Quick question: some of the tickers in your portfolio have relatively low trading volume, have you experienced liquidity issues? Especially when needing to de leverage"
2021-04-18 09:21:24,wallstreetbets,"Seems it would be smarter/easier to use a risk parity strategy using leveraged funds like UPRO/TMF at a chosen ratio. Much easier to manage, no margin required. Takes a strong stomach for the drawdowns. Lots of debate on optimal ratio of UPRO:TMF. Requires periodic rebalance which also has much debate to optimal rebalance windows (weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc).  

Best part is it does not require a large initial investment. Use monthly contributions to help rebalance. Funds do the leverage. 

Another option would be something like PDSLX which manages the entire portforlio (at admittedly higher cost). 

Obligatory, not financial advice."
2021-04-18 10:19:06,wallstreetbets,"Some questions, hopefully I am not too late to this post:

1) If you are selling equities to keep leverage from going over 2.2, won't that cause inefficiencies where you have both cash and debt (thru the short SPX boxes)? Or do you also buy back boxes when selling equities after a drop to reduce your cash balance?

2) Is there any reason to prefer larger spreads on the short boxes vs buying more short boxes (or the other way around)? Or does it make no difference? Some of your spreads are quite large, but I would imagine shorter spreads and more short boxes would allow you to buy/sell options that have greater volume?

3) Do you always buy the boxes with expiration dates out as far as possible? If so, why not earlier dates to get better borrowing rates?

4) What happens at the expiration date? Can you just let the box expire, or do you have to buy it back?

5) Are you worried about IBKR selling legs from the short box and causing your portfolio to implode?

6) What are the criteria that would cause you to reduce or entirely remove leverage? Specifically, if rates were higher, you had no income, or you hit some portfolio size would you delever? Or would you continue the strategy in any of those scenarios?"
2021-04-18 10:51:45,wallstreetbets,"Nice one. But I have to ask, it looks like the top 4 holdings (VBR, VFMF, FNDC, FNDF) were underperforming the Nasdaq and SP500 in the longer term.

2. If you can get tighter spreads with more, shorter boxes, do that!

4. Just let it expire. It's all cash-settled.
5. I've heard about that, not really.
6. Leverage is a function of the equity risk premium (stock return minus borrowing rate) and long-term volatility. If my borrowing rates went substantially up as you say, then I would leverage less. Or if stocks, say, doubled in price. I don't take income or portfolio size into account though."

2021-04-17 23:30:18,wallstreetbets,"> Kelly Criterion

I thought the Kelley Criterion had more to do with fixed odds like flipping a coin. The stock market is not a fixed odds, we know over time it continues to grow, with various dips along the way. For example let's compare SPY and SPXL a 3x leveraged SPY, and SPUU a 2x leveraged SPY. The ETF comparison tool I use only goes to 5 years so I can't really see ""bad times"" in it but there have been some ups and downs. In down times the 3x dropped a bit more than the 2x but there is no comparison in the end. 3x leverage is better than 2x leverage. So I presume 6x would be better than 3x. :)

I meant more for the average investor. It is a much easier leveraged portfolio to understand and execute. 

PDSLX theoretically would perform better in a rising rate environment as they use corporate bonds rather than treasuries. Course, also doesn't mean it would outperform against your portfolio. Especially considering costs."
2021-04-18 13:09:48,wallstreetbets,"Thanks. Appreciate the info and am looking forward to the comprehensive guide!

On the box spreads: given that having X times larger spread vs X more short boxes are mathematically equivalent, I have a suspicion it should not make any difference because the market maker algorithms should see them as equivalent. I don't know for sure though. It might be possible to test this by slowing walking down limit orders with different spreads and seeing if they get filled at the same borrowing rate.

On borrowing costs: one could argue that because you are borrowing at close to the risk-free rate, the expected return on your borrowed equities should always be the equity risk premium. And if the equity risk premium and equity volatility are independent to the borrowing rate, then the borrowing cost should not affect the strategy. It sounds like you do not buy this argument if you would leverage less if borrowing costs went up? I'm not sure I buy it."

2021-04-18 13:23:28,wallstreetbets,"If you believe the equity risk premium is constant, then yes youre correct! And in historical backtest, that’s what I essentially assume since I used 2:1 leverage regardless of the TBill rate. In the real world, I like to keep tabs on my expectation of equity returns and TBills. When the equity risk premium appears abnormally large (either because stocks are really cheap, or risk free rate has gone down substantially, or both like in March2020) or abnormally low (like it would’ve been the case in 2000 when rates were near 4% and equity forward returns looked to be basically as large as that), then I change the amount of leverage somewhat. Again, it’s not a requirement to do this, just something I think is logical to do a bit of."
2021-04-18 10:48:38,wallstreetbets,"If I thought timing the market worked, I would add that! And since you do, then I encourage you to leverage based on technical indicators."
2021-04-17 23:07:54,wallstreetbets,"I think he did. Reading quickly through the comments, his idea is basically just holding a diversified portfolio and amplify the returns by borrowing money so that you have a x2 leverage.

I think the same could be done without borrowing money. Sufficiently deep ITM leaps can provide you with a similar leverage without theta-raping you and you can build your portfolio around them.

EDIT: not sure if similar tax-wise though."
2021-04-18 01:58:18,wallstreetbets,"What else do you need explained? Seriously, if you don't understand:  
1) Open a portfolio margin account.

2) Fund it.

3) Buy twice as much in stocks as you could with your cash (i.e., use margin to leverage 2:1).

4) Borrow more to buy more when leverage drops and vice-versa, to maintain leverage at around 2:1.  
If that, combined with literal screenshots of my portfolios, are not enough of an explanation, then this probably isn't a strategy you should use."

2021-04-18 07:56:32,wallstreetbets,"There's a good paper about deleveraging when the spy is below its 200dma because volatility tends to be much higher when that happens (volatility and leverage are natural enemies) .  The resulting risk adjusted returns are 0retty great.   Also I've been thinking to maintain an allocation to other asset classes like bonds,  realestate ,  etc. To avoid massive drawdowns. 

How long have you been running this type of portfolio?   Leveraged equities only will blow up eventually, or at least suffer a huge drawdown, even if diversified.   I do agree though that 2:1 is the upper limit of optimal leverage"
2021-04-18 14:27:51,wallstreetbets,"Cool

2021-04-18 10:53:30,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I think I've seen the paper you're referring too. To the extent 200dma is a strong volatility **leading** indicator, then I think it's fine if you use it.

There are literally joke Due diligence posted on here with more effort. 


I literally said ""the very basics of advanced"" and ""she"" now says I don't know advanced tactics...

And really, if she isn't giving you more detail, then she literally actually only understands the VERY BASICS of what she's doing.

Look, I'm a fucking asshole myself, not pretending I'm not. I'm just not going to half ass explain something that can bankrupt you if you don't get it. I'm not sadistic. The reason this type of stuff isn't pushed on you, is because anyone who masters it shuts the FUCK UP ABOUT IT. I have no incentive to thoroughly explain it without you paying me. I'm better off taking the money available to me in my circle, creating a sophisticated portfolio, manage money for those around me, and make money. 


Here's the major red flag:
If you EVER see a person posting their returns, and they annualized them, when they don't have even one year of trading on the account under their strategy, that person is not a sophisticated trader. No sophisticated trader will post their under one year results bragging. There's a REASON the results look so good right now. The way this is being portrayed to you is EXTRMELY misleading as to the long term results, as well as how this will need to be managed. I would never show you this stuff myself without showing you a 5 year track record. Massive redflag again here? No explanation of reg T vs portfolio margin, no real thorough explanation of how you'll keep and manage the leverage as the portfolio increases or decrease, etc. 

Look, you can use leverage, that's not my issue. I'm fucking leveraged out. The explanation is pathetic at best though, and this isn't a ""revolutionary"" strategy. It's just barely understanding the advanced basics."
2021-04-18 03:00:22,wallstreetbets,"I don't disagree with sounding condescending although I hope you can see that if people have actual questions or want help, I will either answer directly or let them know where to look for the answer. I only patronize those with irrelevant or rude comments, such as those telling me how I'm an idiot, stupid, this is just as easy as just leveraging in a bull market, doing a terrible job explaining, and so on. I guess in my mind, if the sole purpose of a comment is to offend, I'll just offend back.

I’d rate the advice you gave the same rating I would to people who call trading ladders a “risk free strategy.” Seriously, one of the first things I had to learn about trading and investing was doing the inverse of what you said. I hold through profitability, especially with high alpha, high risk option plays(when I pay pennies for a reasonable x10-20 expectation). Imagine trading options and selling out after a 25% loss which is a 2% intraday swing. In short, never let your losses dictate the price you sell your options or shares at."

2021-04-17 22:07:02,wallstreetbets,"Lmao clearly you’ve never actually invested with leverage. I’m recommending people keep leverage under control and de-lever if losses accrue, a vital part of any leveraged strategy. Doing the opposite, as you suggest, is exactly how you can get wiped out and lose it all."
2021-04-18 14:58:22,wallstreetbets,"Ok I think there's a small communication error from my part. In my mind, there is a big difference between:  
1) What I called ""trend-following"": Using a moving average like dma200 to decide when to fully exit my position and delever, and go back in.

2) Managed futures (aka time-series momentum): Using a composite of various lookback windows to determine a trend, then sizing a long/short position based on expected volatility and adding it as a diversifying alternative to your portfolio of stocks.  


However, I just realized AQR calls managed-future ""trend following"" as well, which I thought was the colloquial term for DMA, technical strategies.  


Ok regardless, I don't hold much hope for the first one (which you suggested). It would be really tax-inefficient, plus inconsistent with the Kelly Criterion. No matter how bad the trend, I never expect a negative equity risk premium, so I'd never exit the market.  
However, some amount of it is reasonable. So either decreasing leverage somewhat based on a trend, or adding a small position in a dedicated managed futures fund on top of my portfolio, is much more reasonable. So it's a matter of degree. I have some confidence in managed-futures a la AQR, but nowhere near enough as an actual timing model to sell everything like DMA200 suggests.  


OTOH, cross-sectional momentum? I feel pretty good about adding as much as I can to my stocks. So regardless of my leverage or bear/bull market, I always want the trendiest stocks."

I recently tried to figure out how to use the insanely low interest rate on a home loan to finance some of my share purchases. Unfortunately the tax man in Australia let’s you gamble away on realestate and offset your cost against regular income but not do the same with shares. This is an interesting alternative albeit a bit more risky due to the shorter timeframes of your box spreads compared to a multi year fixed home loan.

[US Weekly Box Office Grosses \($\) - Source: Bloomberg 4\/17\/21](https://preview.redd.it/tu8r6jo3rst61.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d0fced0cbc3ace032915b3d860fe811bead118f)

I know you Apes have been waiting to hit the big screen! Well Warner Bros. ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" has infused new life into the jungle and a struggling US box office in 2020, prompting an upward revision in 2Q estimates across Wall Street. Yet it's too soon to draw conclusions. Film delays and ""day-and-date,"" or studios streaming movies on the same day as their theatrical release, are risks.

***1)  ""Godzilla vs Kong"" to Top Box Office Again***

It's is expected to top box-office charts for a third consecutive weekend with an estimated $8.7 million, bringing gross receipts to $82.6 million, according to Box Office Pro. California's ArcLight shut down last week, Regal's staggered reopening will continue, so the lack of new films this week should pull total receipts 25-30% lower, based on Box Office Pro estimates. ArcLight and Regal should give AMC an edge going into final spring months and even the early months of the summer when Box Office blockbusters usually get released.

[US Box Office Projections for April 16 - Source: Bloomberg 4\/17\/21](https://preview.redd.it/bf44qo0oust61.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c44c55b0aa8766766dca657d4030366f74594ae4)

***2) US Vaccine Available To All in 2Q; Theatres Also Gets Shot in Arm With Reopenings***

With cinemas only gradually reopening, 1Q21's box office totaled just under $240 million, an 87% plunge from the $1.83 billion in 1Q20. While that's not totally surprising, 2Q results will be much better, given the success of ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" even with only 55% of cinemas open. As Regal & AMC reopens more of its theaters in April, 2Q box office may hit $650 million, based on Box Office pro's projections, despite Disney's decision to release highly anticipated summer movies ""Cruella"" and ""Black Widow"" on its Disney+ service at the same time as they're available in theaters. Warner's ""Mortal Kombat"" will be out on April 16.

***3)  'Godzilla vs. Kong' Monstrous Open Roars Box Office Back to Life Around the World***

Following a strong international open, Warner Bros. ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" U.S. release had high expectations leading into the long Easter weekend. Those receipts, coming in slightly above the $13.5 million [the studio initially reported](https://variety.com/2021/film/news/box-office-godzilla-vs-kong-nobody-1234948900/) on Sunday, propel the film’s overall tally to $70 million. After two weeks of release, “[Godzilla vs. Kong](https://variety.com/t/godzilla-vs-kong/)” already ranks as the highest-grossing movie of the pandemic era, surpassing Christoper Nolan’s puzzling sci-fi thriller “Tenet,” which ended its theatrical run with $58.4 million.  (Source: Variety Magazine / Variety.com).  This as a step in the right direction leading into the summer blockbuster period as hybrid day-and-date release strategies aren't deterring fans from the theatrical experience. As more vaccines are distributed and theater capacity restrictions are relaxed, expect continued higher box-office receipts.

***4)  AMC Re-Opens California Cinema To Kick-Off Summer Early***

In a small step toward recovery in the global film industry, AMC, the largest theater operator in the world, announced the reopening of 54 of its California locations in March. Disney’s “Raya and the Last Dragon” is projected to take the weekend’s top spot, while Roadside Attraction’s “The Courier” are other notable new films releasing this weekend. (Source: Bloomberg 4/17/21)

***5) Wall Street ""Hate-Love"" Relationship***

Wall Street analysts absolutely HATED the stock in 2020. From May 2020 to March 2021 there wasn't a single BUY rating. B. Riley analyst Eric Wold was the FIRST to put a BUY rating on AMC since the pandemic. On Friday he said that the CEO’s comments on the share authorization should be interpreted as good news on AMC’s cash position for the year.

On Wednesday, Aron told YouTube host Trey Collins in an interview on “Trey’s Trades”: “We hereby pledge at AMC that if the shareholders approve this authorization for 500 million new shares to be issued we will not use one of those 500 million shares in calendar year 2021. Not one. Not one.”

Aron also said AMC still has authorization to issue 43 million shares “that we could use if we wish to raise some cash, if we decide that’s a good idea. We have made no decisions yet. We are thinking about it, but we haven’t made any decisions yet.” Excerpts of the interview were [disclosed in a securities filing ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000110465921050489/tm2113075d1_defa14a.htm)dated Thursday.

Over the past year Wall Street analysts still keeps a fairly high rating on the stock,

&#x200B;

***5) AMC Lightens Up Debt Like GME***

Like all companies, going into the pandemic highly levered (with tons of debt) wasn't a good idea, which is not surprising that so many hedge funds went after GME and AMC. GME recently announced that they are going to be debt free and AMC also lightened up their load this year when various PE firms like Silver Lake and Mudrick coverted their convertible notes into equity.

[AMC's debt in coming years is low and at a very low interest rate \(sub 3&#37;\), with the majority of its callable debt maturing in 2026. The company is now generating cash flow again which will easily have plenty of runway to get them through 2021 and to 2026. They should have no liquidity issues this year so as long as theatres continue to re-open. \(Source: Bloomberg 4\/17\/21\)](https://preview.redd.it/o6kgwc4f9ut61.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b8df16a0de21a46980107df20eeb7e1e4df7387)

***6) SHORT INTEREST BACK UP***

Almost at 100% utilization, and 93.92MM shares short interest, next week will be interesting. Borrowing rates have also jumped back up this week. For those who are hoping for a gamma squeeze or short squeeze, I'm sure there are tons of you already reading other DDs and watching YouTube videos so I don't need to explain here. We're all here to make money. I'll be honest, I did a YOLO bet using AMC Call Options on the first pump up to $20 in late Jan and paperhanded and took gainz on the ride up. Now that the stock has pulled back to a decent level, this time I'm using shares, as there is just way too much market manipulation going on in the weekly options expirations with the market makers. This week, I saw tons of tutes coming in buying big blocks (100,000 to 1,000,000 share blocks) of AMC throughout the week, and I started accumulating from the high $8 range. Will continue to watch the MaxPain and options activity in coming days and weeks and play the trading range in addition to HOLDing shares.

2021-04-18 12:13:37,wallstreetbets,.....a legit amc DD?... i must be dreaming.
2021-04-18 10:47:27,wallstreetbets,Didn't read any of the DD but bullish af! MORTAL COMBAT!!!!!
2021-04-18 15:26:11,wallstreetbets,I have an AMC $2.5 6/18 call I bought for $110. Held through $19.90. I didn't hear no bell.

2021-04-17 22:20:27,wallstreetbets,"Sadly, those are bad numbers if you look back far enough. The recovery to more theatre visits and the return to pre-covid losses for AMC are far out.  They promise not to sell more stock this year.. They want more shares issued as they start unloading in January.  Just trade it. Not an investment, not even close."
2021-04-18 12:04:19,wallstreetbets,"#1) The Movies are still a great place to go on a 1st date, unless you’re the kind of person that’s ok with giving strangers on Bumble your home address so that you can stream movies together and hope he/she is not a serial killer. 2) Don’t give me this “you shouldn’t be dating in a pandemic” bullshit cuz ya’ll gonna die single. Covid is NOT going away. As a human race we fucked it up early in the covid game by not quarantining soon enough and properly, so get over it, covid is here to stay. 3) Going to a movie theatre has been a tradition for over 100 years now. I don’t think anyone’s stupid comments on here are going to change that tradition. AMC will be the only chain to survive as Arclight and Pacific theatres are already calling it quits! You can thank WSB and all of our efforts for helping AMC survive! 🎥🍿❤️"

2021-04-18 14:55:20,wallstreetbets,Im going balls deep about inch n half on monday open with amc.
2021-04-17 21:09:43,wallstreetbets,"I think the real question here is what's your cost basis on those shares?  If it's 15, you're fucked, if it's 4, you're golden.  The real bet you're making isn't that AMC all of a sudden has good fundamentals or a better business model, it's that 1) retail will push up the stock on general good feeling from reopening, 2) there will be a short squeeze, or 3) now that the Paramount decision has been overturned, one of the big streamers (probably Amazon) will buy AMC and you'll get a premium for your shares.

All of those are fine bets to make, and it's your money, but this DD just pretends like AMC the company is somehow better, and it's really not, plus it's been heavily diluted from pre-pandemic yet is trading at pre-pandemic prices.  I don't dislike the stock enough to to buy puts on it, but I also definitely don't like it enough to buy shares or calls on it."
2021-04-17 22:33:57,wallstreetbets,"Phebes, Thanks.  People want to see movies.  They have cash flow to service the debt.   
 Streaming by the studios will not eliminate the theatrical release.  I presume that's the only reason why the gay bear analysts have PT of 1.00."

2021-04-17 21:22:48,wallstreetbets,"It confuses me that people think the world will reopen this summer, that will only prolong the virus and let it keep on mutating. 

And why would anyone spend money to go see a move with a bunch of random annoying strangers laughing at unfunny things and reacting at things that are non reaction worthy. And it's expensive as he'll when you can watch the same move in the comfort of your home."

2021-04-18 15:05:35,wallstreetbets,What's going to stop AMC from issuing more shares and watering down the price again and again and again? They have shown that's what they want to do. Pissed off owner of way too much AMC garbage ... Should have bought fucking gme
2021-04-17 21:34:38,wallstreetbets,Chamath backed the apes by buying GME during the first Gamestop squeeze and also attacked RH for limiting trades. Since then the shorts have attacked him. Apes should pay it forward and pick up a share of $CLOV on Monday.

They have just acquired even more small chain theaters in california and the CEO has purchased 200,000 shares himself this month. That’s a bet that he can increase value in the company. Adam Aron is a great CEO who turned Vail Resorts from 2 mountains and a few hotels to the 2nd largest ski operation in North America. BULLISH."

Simple. People want to go back out and enjoy time
Outside of their place. No changes needed to be made, I guess just a pandemic sadly to
Make people recognize they’d rather go blow money outside of their home with family and friends . The experience just simply doesn’t compare."
2021-04-18 15:46:50,wallstreetbets,Every time they diluted the stock price went up after. It is not like they use it just for shits and giggles all at once. They use it to acquire companies or reduce debt...

2021-04-18 04:59:17,wallstreetbets,"Maybe the push to ""get back out there"" is worth something? Idk"

2021-04-18 05:00:44,wallstreetbets,I'm confused. Is there a monthly cost or are the movies free?

I was at my pool yesterday and it was like sausage fest full of dudes all desperately looking at the few girls in bikinis👙 .

I was just out with my girlfriends for dinner and they were like ""we haven't been out in ages, when we can we go out again? Tomorrow?"". Human behavior will ensure that the movie theatres will be packed once again. The gay bear analysts all collude with the gay bear hedge funds. Once we get a few more gay bear analysts to turn straight, that will be the sign that the stock will be going up up up. Cash is king and AMC are in a much better place today than they were 6-12 months ago when the sky was falling and all the doors were shut."
2021-04-18 05:10:21,wallstreetbets,"Maybe 4X+ dilution of a stock that traded at like $7.50 pre-COVID... Simple math says 7.5/4=1.875... Well $1.88 is the share price it would need to be today to be where it was pre-COVID. Add on to that, likely less people going to theaters for the next couple of years (especially older people or people with other health conditions) not sure how you turn around this goose."

2021-04-18 11:43:11,wallstreetbets,It’s $23.99 a month for the A-List membership but that’s how much it costs to watch ONE movie these days anyway.

2021-04-18 16:56:08,wallstreetbets,"Hmm definitely not baked in. The only thing baked in was 25-30 % capacity in locations .

By end of summer nation should be half vaccinated which should help places break the 50% capacity threshold and help raise entertainment/social meet up locations (restaurants, movies and shopping)

Edit : also a lot of places across the US are in tier slates communities that restricts the amount that go into places . That restricts your sales. Plus a lot of people are still not comfortable until they been vaccinated or they hear herd immunity is amongst us. I know some of my family who haven’t gone out because of this thought process. My mom just got vaccinated and finally feels safe to go out. As time goes on the bottle neck will get wider and wider and there will no longer be one. 

Things will be back to a normal feeling soon. No way this is baked in"
2021-04-18 17:45:38,wallstreetbets,Whats your argument anyway. Gamestop was falling too before covid and we all know why. That says nothing about the company.

2021-04-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Explanation of the $CLOV 10k and Calculating Short Interest by hand Edit: I seem to be getting downvoted a lot, yet not a single person has replied criticizing my math and the numbers....

TL;DR: The real short interest is 35.1% and the data provider which first reported 140% has changed it back to this number. Also, I apologize in advance for disrupting the echo chamber.

Over the last two days many people all over every social media platform have been in debate as to what $CLOV's real float count is and what the real short interest as a % of the Float is. I am here to explain what went wrong in FactSet's calculations (which have now been fixed BTW: [source](https://imgur.com/gallery/HocOE0G)) and to calculate the float by hand using information and data provided in $CLOV's 10k to confirm the validity. Feel free to criticize any of the data presented.

Here are some facts that are not being widely disputed for reference:

* There are 145,345,832 Class A shares outstanding -[source](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521102551/d89571d10k.htm)
* The CEO owns 0 Class A shares -[source](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521102551/d89571d10k.htm)
* There are 38,504,281 Shares Short as of March 31st 2021- source: FactSet can't provide link but it seems as though this figure is not being disputed.

What is being disputed specifically is the number of shares that are part of the publicly traded float:

Yesterday FactSet reported that float was \~26.3M shares down from what they were reporting 2 days ago at \~109.8M shares. FactSet had subtracted 83.5M shares from the float making the denominator in the SI/Float equation plummet causing the short interest% to skyrocket to 140%+. FactSet incorrectly made this subtraction. **The CEO's shares were NEVER part of FactSet's calculated Float to begin with.** FactSet's float had always consisted of tradable Class A shares, yet it subtracted the CEO's Class B shares from the float. My guess is that someone challenged the data provided by FactSet and an analyst at FactSet changed the number according to the challenge but did not spend the time to properly verify the validity of the data they were changing. Now the number has been changed back to 109M shares float.

&#x200B;

Now for the 10k:

&#x200B;

[10K color coded](https://preview.redd.it/asn64bf8hst61.jpg?width=1708&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e98280fa82eb00501fdaa8e5d10d811a678b65f0)

This 10k is very easily misinterpreted without looking at the subscripts at the bottom. There is so much overlap when it comes to shares owned. Reading the subscript #3 at the bottom we can see that **Chamath's 30M shares are overlapped with the 20M and 10M shares owned by SCH Sponser III LLC and ChaChaCha SPAC C LLC** respectively. This means that the shares owned by SCH Sponsor III LLC + the shares owned by ChaChaCha SPAC C LLC + the shares owned by Chamath's = 30,500,000.

Further, Entities affiliated with Ian Osborne also own 25,500,000 Class A shares. As we above, 20,500,000 of those shares are from SHC Sponsor III LLC **which are already included in Chamath's 30,500,000 Class A shares.** This leaves an extra 5M shares owned by Ian Osborne that are not related to entities owned by Chamath.

Therefore, there are 30,500,000 + 5,000,000 = 35,500,000 Class A shares owned by Insiders and locked up. **The rest, 145,345,832 - 35,500,000 =  109,845,832, are part of the Float.**

Taking the #of shares short and dividing by the Float that we calculated gives us:

(38,504,281 /  109,845,832) \* 100 = **35.05301958 % of float being shorted.**

Now to clear up some more misconceptions:

[Vanguard's 26,185,529 Class A shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000110465921049151/tv0001-cloverhealthinvestmen.htm) are completely tradable and not locked up whatsoever and therefore, are still part of the float.

*Processing img qxzqcfeajst61...*

It is clear from a close reading of the 10k that there are many things wrong with the data here:

1. Vanguard should not be considered as part of the Class A Lockup shares since they can freely trade AND lend shares. Therefore, those 26,185,529 shares **should not** be subtracted from the shares outstanding.
2. The creator of this table failed to realize that Chamath's 30M shares are the same as SCH Sponsor III and ChaChaCha SPAC C's shares and mistakenly subtracts them from the shares outstanding twice. Further, 20M of Ian Osborne's shares are wrongly being subtracted as well since they are overlapped with SCH Sponsor III."

Shares trading multiples of their float in a day is not too abnormal of an occurrence. But the high short volume as you pointed out could mean that since March 31st (from which the latest shares short # is reflective of) the Short Interest could have gone up. But it would not have gone up by 89M shares. A vast majority of those 89M shares that were shorted were likely immediately covered. Market Makers regularly do this to keep up with buying demand and then immediately cover when they get the chance. Apple's short volume for example is around 17%."

2021-04-18 10:24:36,wallstreetbets,That's not how gamma squeezes work. Options are hedged when written by institutions. So it needs to have either a wild swing upwards for fresh calls to be written or some unusual options activity to start a gamma squeeze.
2021-04-18 17:07:52,wallstreetbets,"Here is my reason I think mortgage companies are a terrible investment right now.  At least for the long term. 

Hyper inflation is coming, it’s actually already here.  I think in the next few years, we see inflation similar to post WWI Germany (ok, maybe not THAT bad).  

And who stands to get the most fucked from this?  A mortgage company.  Why?  Fixed rate mortgages. 

When one dollar today, is worth 10 dollars in a few years.  Your 2500 dollar a month fixed rate mortgage is gonna seem like 250 dollars. They’re going to be stuck making pre-inflation profits.  Also, when a 2 bedroom house is worth 1 mil post inflation, not many people will be buying houses. 

In fact, the best move you can make to prepare for hyperinflation is to borrow as much money as possible (ie. a mortgage) at a fixed rate before the inflation occurs. In a few years time, those payments will seem like tiddlywinks, and you’ll be able to pay off your debt easily. 

If hyperinflation occurs, and I truly believe it’s coming, we will see mortgage companies going out of business left and right."

2021-04-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Extremely thorough CLOV recent action DD I’m going to go back a little bit in time and tell you how CLOV was directly related to GME squeeze.
So when GME was squeezing two very influential people have backed the squeeze and caused it to squeeze even more. Those two people were Elon Musk and Chamath Palihapitiya. Both partners in previous endeavors and friends. 
GME squeeze hurt short seller Hindenburg so much that they have lost 40% of their account that week. 
CLOV is backed by Chamath Palihapitiya. Hindenburg, in order to retaliate at Chamath for causing them huge losses, published a short seller report for CLOV few days after Chamath tweeted about GME. Short seller report had very little base, yet that caused the stock to drop and also SEC had to initiate an investigation due to the claims. 
Since then stock got beaten down to less than IPO prices. What does that mean? It means that it was moved not so much by true owners of the stock, but mostly by short sellers. That will play in nicely in the squeeze because short sellers always have to close out, but if stock is still held by their true purchasers it means that there are even less shares available for active trading. 



Enough of history. Retail following:

Since GME endeavor Chamath PAlihapitiya joined the club of “retail gods”.... he is one of the poster babies for retail movement on hurting short sellers. His previous partnerships with Elon Musk furthers retail following so now not only we have GME crowd supporting Chamath, but also Tesla crowd. Both of those stocks were some of the most successful trades in history. 



Friday’s Hindenburg’s fright with CLOV:

On Friday CLOV has opened with 148% short interest and after this was noticed by retail the squeeze has started. The volume topped 250M shares traded (10x average daily volume and 5x its previous heaviest volume day). (Ill get in to more technicals later, but needed to mention this to push the narrative).
Hindenburg saw the action and protecting their possible short position tweeted that FactSet has misleading short interest data about CLOV not including CEOs clad B shares in the float. 
FactSet came back to Hindenburg’s allegations with a reply that CEOs type B shares are classified as not tradable and are not included in the float. And once again confirmed that stock is 148% short.
This further angered retail traders and a lot of chatter online has started how Hindenburg is trying to manipulate this stock with lies and deceit. 
A lot of people didn’t catch on on Friday but through the night and this afternoon Reddit and stock twits seem to have exploded about it, videos are popping up on YouTube. A lot of traction is being created over the weekend for a sweet Monday open. 



Technicals:
*CLOV free float is 109mil 
*CLOV shares outstanding are 406mil
*78% of CLOV shares are owed by insiders and are still locked up. Insiders are only allowed to sell if stock hits $30 and stays above $30 for 90 days 
*institutional ownership of CLOV is at 48%

*the volume on Friday was 249mil shares which only represents 61% turn over for shares outstanding, but if you take locked up shares out of consideration, true turn over was actually 228%, meaning every share available to trade was bought and sold at least twice on Friday. 

A lot of people that bought on Friday (including NEXT financial group that bought 21,400 shares) will not likely be actively trading this week meaning available shares short term will continue on decreasing.

In my speculation out of 109 mil free float Only around 35% of shares will be available to trade this week. Here is how I got to this number: 
-institutions owe 48% of stock and they are not likely to trade short term fluctuations, but giving it a benefit of doubt let’s say that institutions that will hold account only to 30% of float. Now we only have 70% of float left to trade....
-let’s assume that investors that owe CLOV long term account for 20% of the float. A lot of them don’t check stocks daily or sometimes even weekly. Let’s assume that half of them even won’t notice what is happening this week. At this point we only have 50% of float left to trade. 
-the rest of the free float is being traded by scalpers/ day traders, swing traders and “diamond handers”. This is a very educated group and unless scalping or pattern trading will understand that we are in the middle of the squeeze and hold. I believe this group will contribute to another 15% of float being unavailable, assuming half of them will be trading fluctuations and half holding. 
So my conclusion is: only 35% of available shares will be circulating next week being sold and bought over and over again. That’s only 38mil shares not being stuck in someone’s account semi permanently. Some more liquidity will be provided short term by other shorters flocking in, but I won’t take them in consideration because they too have to close out at some point. 

Fallowing all this speculative, yet very carefully vetted math let’s calculate the demand for the shares, just to close short positions
-148% of the free float is shorted, meaning 161mil shares will be in demand just to close out short positions. Since we already established that there will be only 38mil shares freely circulating in the market each short share will only have 0.24 shares. So looks like there are 4 times less shares than demand to close short positions! Throw in some buying activity to that math and you have a number closer to 10:1. 

Following all of that the question is how far the stock can go during this particular squeeze? Well the answer is: it’s mathematically impossible to calculate. Although there are some indicators of what people can expect. Smaller the float, the bigger the short interest and the heavier the volume the further it can go. In this particular instance we have the combination of all three factors. Even if it’s impossible to predict exactly what price short squeeze will hit, it’s possible to trade short squeeze well using technical indicators and trade management. Monitoring volume, daily short interest and days to cover should be adequate. To know when short squeeze is ending I monitor same indicators that made me spot the short squeeze to start with, but in reverse. Meaning volume will start to tapper off, short percentage decrease and the upwards momentum will start to whilt. I also watch out for extremely sudden, needle like falls (trailing stop loss domino effect). 

I hope the read was interesting and I haven’t lost you half way through. 

I won’t go into any CLOV fundamentals or any of that good stuff cause I think we already established that everything is in order there. It is also completely irrelevant in a mathematical squeeze."

Kenny G makes lots of money selling option contracts that expire worthless. Kenny needs more money and is now pushing a new meme stock ""next gme"" so that apes buy YOLO call options.

? source?"
2021-04-18 11:16:17,wallstreetbets,"> Yeah guess who owns a portion of the portfolio and is going to benefit from this...CITADEL. 

They'll pretty much own any meme stock with a call/put imbalance, they are market makers and they need to delta hedge the calls they sold. In that respect they don't really own the upside fully, but give it to the call buyers for a fee (= they make money no matter what *usually*). Since their hedge position can become big, they need to report it through the official channels. They'll also be a huge driver of share buys in a potential gamma squeeze, where it could move so quickly that they might actually lose money."

In like the very beginning of February last year I took my $4k I had saved up and saw people making shit loads here so I ballsed up and learned how to start trading options. In my first big trade I made $1300 off of SPCE in the golden days. Little while later, the market began crashing on feb 21st. News about coronavirus came out saying it has a high chance of spreading to America. Wsb was chaos, it was clear this drop was not the end. It only took me about 3 hours to realize that pure spy puts were the move. Made $18k off of it, more money than I’ve ever had in my whole life. I could pay off my student loans right then and there. Instead of doing the smart thing and taking some profits, I decided to stop reading posts from wsb and trade on my own. Within like a week the puts I had got wrecked and it was clear they would expire worthless. Slowly I watched that money burn up into nothing. 

But god damn was it fun as fuck, my favorite day was when I woke up and saw I was up $10k within the first 10 minutes of the market being open. I went to my class chipper as fuck, felt like I had a 10 foot cock."

The new ones always have lots of insider shares that can’t sell in the beginning. After she’s broken in she won’t be a close anything. But for this year, ok, technically.

At this point, just short the whole market. Because why not, the market itself might just be a dIsTrAcTiOn from GME since I'm pretty sure Citadel is beta-positive.

2021-04-18 13:15:36,wallstreetbets,"The original SI number that everyone was touting around on Friday was 149%. HUGE difference between 149% and 35%. Also here is a list of the highest short interest stocks as of last reporting period:

[https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest)

**There are 9 more stocks with higher short interest than $CLOV right now**. 

>You realize anything over 10% is considered abnormally high

Well obviously ""abnormally high"" is subjective but to put into perspective:

[https://imgur.com/gallery/axKmPA7](https://imgur.com/gallery/axKmPA7)

648 out of the 8037 stocks (8%) on FinViz's screener have a short interest of greater than 10%. And 27 out of the 8037 stocks (.3%) have a SI of over 30%. 

The conclusion here is that 35% SI on a stock is **more than a daily occurrence**. A GameStop like squeeze here is very very unlikely or else we would see 10+ stocks squeeze at those magnitudes daily."
2021-04-18 01:28:58,wallstreetbets,Would be better off just buying more GME.

2021-04-18 17:23:31,wallstreetbets,"No, the point of the feint is that it cannot and will not squeeze because the short interest simply isn't there in the quantity that you're thinking it is. It will *look* like a squeeze is happening if FOMO occurs from people who don't do their own research, but all you'll end up with is a worthless bag at the end of it.

2021-04-18 01:37:50,wallstreetbets,"The amount of shares or the cost per share doesn’t matter as much as the total invested and the percentage gained. 

For example you could have 100 shares for a $160 cost total that gains by 190% but it’ll still be less than the one share @160 that gains by 200% or more percent"
2021-04-18 01:36:25,wallstreetbets,"It's a bad stock to short.... NOW! But when most of the shorting was happening (to bury the company into the ground), covid was happening, they were in debt, and had poor guidance. All of a sudden Ryan Cohen steps into the picture. Deepfuckingvalue sees the....well....deepfuckingvalue and goes all in. Now the shorts are stuck. They want out but retail knows what happening. I strongly suggest checking out some DD. It's fascinating, and at the very least, I've learned more about the market in 4 months than I did years prior."
2021-04-18 16:14:59,wallstreetbets,"There are squeezes every single day in the stock market. Every single day. In a bull market, the stocks are squeezing 100-300%.

A few months ago, there were 300% runners everyday. This doesn't happen without shorts getting squeezed when the price breaks resistance. They get nervous and start covering causing the price to go up and the old supply zone becoming a new demand zone.

Recently, the daily top gainers have only been 20-30% so the risk/reward for shorts is much lower and they hold their position longer without covering. This die to depressed volume market wide. Algos aren't buying small caps or hyper growth stocks so it's too easy to pull the rug. Remember, algos make up 80 -90% of the trading volume and when those algos are turned off, volume dies.

In the current market, especially for small caps and hyper growth stocks(the stocks most susceptible to short squeezes), the bears have no fear. So not only are they shorting at resistance, theh are doubling down at support.

This will eventually turn on them. Stocks don't go down forever. Again, when your top gainers are 10% to 30% with the top gainers of the day only being 20-30%, shorts have absolutely nothing to fear. The risk/reward is out of whack. Whereas in a typical market with 6-12 top gainers over 30%, shorts don't know what one will squeeze to 300%.

Eventually, the algos will get turned back on and the volume, especially in the premarket where it has been abysmal lately,  will turn the 20-30% gainers into 100-300% and shorts who short without consideration for risk/reward will get squeezed."

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-tom-brady-of-asset-management-people-love-to-hate-cathie-wood-but-her-funds-get-results-11617371226](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-tom-brady-of-asset-management-people-love-to-hate-cathie-wood-but-her-funds-get-results-11617371226)

CFRA thinks ARKK (ARK Innovation ETF) has a high likelihood of outperforming its global equities ETF category in the next nine months based on our multi-faceted ratings approach,” they said, concluding, “stick with this top performing ARK ETF.”

Cathie Wood founded ARK in 2014 and has been in charge since then.

It’s also somewhat unusual for being an active, fully transparent manager of ETFs.

&#x200B;

Cathie Wood runs 7 different ETF's (of AT LEAST 1 year in existence) and they all have gone up from 177% to 391% in the last 16 months or from January 1,2020 to present.

Only included stocks (ETF's) with 1 or more years history. Did NOT include the ARKX fund or Ark Space Exploration & Innovation ETF since it is less than 1 month old, with a March 30,2021 inception date.

Hard to believe but the results AND charts speak for themselves .

&#x200B;

Even if you took out the March 2020 LOW prices and went with January 2020 or February 2020 highs (high share prices BEFORE the Covid19 or coronavirus stock market crash of March 2020),the results are nevertheless extremely impressive.

&#x200B;

High performance over one performance may be attributed to luck by SOME investors but when you consistently have greater than 20% yearly returns over 7 different stocks (or ETF's),then that is WORLD CLASS stock market skill. You are doing something RIGHT.

Cathie Wood is a genuinely extraordinary and extremely aggressive stock picker and analyst. No doubt about that. Her far above average results speak volumes about her skills and abilities.

&#x200B;

Extremely transparent stock picker who shockingly reports her various ETF's investments on a DAILY basis. Not monthly or weekly.

Love the transparency. Very, very unusual.

Let's look at her track record : Specializing in actively managed ETF's that focus on ""INNOVATION"" is obviously her success or stock market secret.

&#x200B;

All prices from March 2020 to February 2021.How the charts look like over the long-term for this extraordinary ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) or ARK Innovation ETF :

April 1,2021 : If Your Mutual Fund Becomes an ETF, Here’s Why : Ark Investment Management’s Cathie Wood brought attention to the category with her slate of actively managed funds that were among the best performing U.S. ETFs in 2020.

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/if-your-mutual-fund-becomes-an-etf-heres-why/2021/04/01/937c43be-92af-11eb-aadc-af78701a30ca\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/if-your-mutual-fund-becomes-an-etf-heres-why/2021/04/01/937c43be-92af-11eb-aadc-af78701a30ca_story.html)

&#x200B;

What’s the difference between a mutual fund and an ETF?

In both mutual funds and ETFs, investors are effectively pooling cash to buy assets by buying shares in the fund. However, mutual funds can only be purchased at the end of each trading day, while ETFs can be bought and sold INTRADAY.

Mutual funds tend to have higher minimum investment requirements and often charge higher fees.

""For most investors, ETFs are more tax efficient, as their structure allows them to minimize capital gains"".

Although both come in actively-managed and passive forms, the majority of ETFs track indexes, while mutual funds are more commonly actively run by an investment manager.

&#x200B;

Cathie Wood : Worth $250 million as of October 13,2020 : Truly self-made and EXTREMELY successful.

&#x200B;

Cathie Wood certainly is a disruptor. Lots of gutsy and extremely unusual stock market moves . An early investor of Twilio Inc, Square Inc., Spotify Technology S.A. stock and Shopify Inc.

&#x200B;

Let's leave with the immortal words of John Templeton :

&#x200B;

“It is impossible to produce SUPERIOR performance unless you do SOMETHING DIFFERENT from the majority.”

Sir John Templeton : In 1954, he entered the mutual fund market and created the Templeton Growth Fund, which averaged growth over 15% per year for 38 years.

2021-04-17 20:29:08,wallstreetbets,I'm still in ARK cause I don't mind bagholding for a while and its not money I need right now. However SPY is at 420 and her funds are way off their ATH's. It doesn't inspire much confidence. What's gonna happen once SPY inevitably corrects again. ARK hasn't gone up with the market the past 2 months. But its sure as hell gone down with it.

Every year you have hundreds of fund managers making risky bets on high beta gambles. A few of them pay off big time. A few of those make subsequent successful bets etc. Eventually, you're left with Cathie. That *someone* would fall into this role was a statistically guaranteed with the long bull run. Happens to be ""Jesus take the wheel"" Cathie.

Unfortunately, the fact that she is *not* finding alpha at all is about to become painfully obvious over the next year or two. In fact, her returns are likely below median when risk adjusted."

She has been very successful recently, but all her gains happened during an overall market expansion.  Peter Lynch managed Fidelity's Magellan Fund and had a cult following 30 years ago.  Lynch did great during the 1980s expansion, then his returns flattened and he quietly retired in 1990.  Cathie Wood will hit a wall soon enough, just like Lynch did, or she may be taken down by one large miscalculation.  Either way, no one ever stays on top for long, life just does not work that way."

Her general thesis is correct but it doesn't look like she as any idea what she's doing on a technical basis. Her recent tsla buys (and sells) are a good example of this. She likes TSLA. At the beginning of the correction TSLA dipped she bought some more immediately. TSLA continued to decline, she bought more. TSLA continued to decline until the NASDAQ fully corrected to 10%. (this was the right time to buy) She never bought more after the second purchase. She got scared.  Market resumed upwards. TSLA increases. TSLA continues to go up. Biden announces infrastructure plan which would greatly benefit TSLA. She sells TSLA stock. She's buying stuff for the future so they are generally good calls but some of her moves clearly show she is inexperienced with trading."

2021-04-18 00:06:43,wallstreetbets,"I see this point a lot but I think it gets exaggerated.  I only buy ARKK though so idk shit about their other funds though.

ARKK is:

24.4% mega cap

47.3% large cap

25% mid cap

and only 3% small cap

Granted their fund is so big that their holdings in some of the smaller mid caps amount to like 10% of these companies.  But for the bulk of their holdings I doubt there’s much of a feedback loop.  Again at least for the K fund.  It might be very valid criticism for the G, F, W, and whatever else mama is running."

You're a pretty terrible analyst if all you do is look at the prices going up and decide it's good (which is what the OP post is). Analyst my arse. 

The stocks ARK invests in are often small and illiquid. What drives the price of stocks? The transacting parties! ARK are in many cases a dominant transacting party. 

Inflows to their ETFs are self-reinforcing. They get the money, they must invest it and it goes toward purchasing the small stocks. This drives up the price of the small illiquid stocks. Boom! ARK funds have outperformed!"

2021-04-17 21:37:28,wallstreetbets,"Which is why they don't hold only their highest conviction stocks, they actively manage and trade around that fact, so they have liquidity available during corrective periods and load up on their high conviction stocks. During bull periods they rotate gains out of those high conviction stocks (that do stellar) to ""diversify"" into the aforementioned. They will harvest tax losses as appropriate and beneficial, as well."
2021-04-18 05:02:02,wallstreetbets,I hate on Aunt Cathie.  I don't give a fuck for her overpriced outlandish price targets of her disrupting disruptors disrupting every industry.  Shes peddling snake oil for the masses.
2021-04-18 08:37:08,wallstreetbets,I heard she spirit writes all of her investment thesis
2021-04-17 20:29:24,wallstreetbets,Etfs have rules about weighting and so on of course. She owns shit tons of tesla and has for a very very long time.
2021-04-18 01:31:58,wallstreetbets,"The fact that you need to compare ARK to a triple leveraged ETF to find similar gains is peak WSB. 

ARK is a high risk ETF but it’s not even comparable to the amount of risk TQQQ is."

The ones selling and causing this constant up and down between $22 and $25, if i'm not horribly wrong are, for the most part, insiders finally (and rigthly so) taking advantage of being able to sell the shares they accumulated pre DPO."

2021-04-18 08:42:52,wallstreetbets,i think someone bought tesla at 850
2021-04-17 23:19:20,wallstreetbets,This. Don't believe every headline you read.
2021-04-17 21:06:50,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-18 01:53:50,wallstreetbets,It's pretty comparable in risk-adjusted return.  But QLD (2x QQQ) is a better comparison for sure as the absolute risk and return are right around where ARKK is.
2021-04-18 10:58:41,wallstreetbets,The chart above shows fairly similar volatility and superior gains for TQQQ. Given some of her recent moves with the fund I'd personally be more comfortable with the TQQQ risk going forward. Your mileage may vary.
2021-04-17 23:38:17,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-18 10:51:46,wallstreetbets,I imagine she would be flattered by this complement.
2021-04-18 10:55:19,wallstreetbets,"I know is a joke, but I don’t think the new treatments can “revert” aging, just stop it, thought."
2021-04-18 19:31:07,wallstreetbets,obviously why do you think I'm here :P
2021-04-18 16:38:17,wallstreetbets,"Those are indexes, you dumb ass."
2021-04-17 21:43:40,wallstreetbets,"Two things. One, they cannot hold more than 10% of any holding in any ETF. They sell Tesla as appropriate, and buy as appropriate. Ultimately they continue to accumulate more shares in absolute terms, while the funds AUM will continue to rise, even if it's a balancing act. This leaves them plenty of dry powder to ensure they can always load up on any dips, and is why they effectively maintain a \~10% holding of Tesla in every portfolio it's admitted to.  


Secondly, their strategy for trading around market rotations and corrections. They load up on high-conviction stocks during bear markets when those stocks are down. They sell out of lower-conviction, ""mature"" stocks to fund this. During secular rotations and corrections they load up on the aforementioned ""mature"" stocks, to provide dry powder for rotations. They trade around these facts, including harvesting tax losses from the sales of the their ""not high conviction"" cash-like holdings.   


That said, Cathie has made it clear they think Coinbase has significant growth potential. They're not selling TSLA to buy COIN. They're selling TSLA because they're required to. If anything, they sold SQ to buy COIN (which is a much fairer comparison, obviously). Cathie has also made it very clear Tesla is their highest conviction holding, period. Don't read into daily trading reports/put words into peoples mouths things that directly contradict their own public statements. Coin is not juicier than Tesla, in Cathie's opinion, until and unless she actually says as much.  


They keep cash on hand because they're actively managed and have to, y'know, trade shit daily."
2021-04-18 14:20:58,wallstreetbets,You were proved wrong and still stuck to your guns. Amazing. Please look into how these funds are managed. I’m tired of reading this same stupid argument you’re making from 10 different people a day.

2021-04-18 06:14:40,wallstreetbets,"I am subbed to their daily trade letter

She sold less etf% of TSLA in ARKK than she bought during the feb/march correction

It's like she bought ~1.5% of ARKK in TSLA during feb/march drawdown, but only sold ~0.75% the past few days

Oh and if you look back further they bought back about the same % that they sold at the highs in january

You should prob get their newsletter that way you can actually analyse their trades. They obviously don't get everything right but they buy on dips and sell on rips AND actively manage their portfolio and they're a big fund now so it's much harder for them i bet to remain nimble like that"
2021-04-18 15:21:53,wallstreetbets,I’m not sure what axe you’ve got to grind here. Tesla is weighted ~10% in their funds. It grew beyond that. She trimmed it back to 10% it’s not an argument that’s literally what is going on. There are no lines to read between

And now we’re being splintered and essentially barred from commiserating about it on good ol’ WSB. Feels like such a sad and awkward ending to chilling with all you apes on here.

2021-04-18 12:12:35,wallstreetbets,Legit. The reason I left r/wallstreetbets after many years of fun.
2021-04-18 12:13:01,wallstreetbets,We like the stock why single it out ? I don’t make post saying how tired I am of hearing about “ AMC” or any other stock I just scroll past it .
2021-04-18 16:12:51,wallstreetbets,haha i didnt realize..... 8 million fucking people here cause of gme and now all of a sudden its what have you done for me lately..... fuck whoever runs this thing
2021-04-18 06:05:42,wallstreetbets,I doubt all 8 million stuck around
2021-04-18 03:17:19,wallstreetbets,It’s probably because the cult-like behavior surrounding GME doesn’t actually fit the sub.
2021-04-18 08:15:35,wallstreetbets,Yeah. anyone who thinks otherwise is truly retarded. After their blatant mod coup there is no way you can think otherwise

2021-04-18 01:21:38,wallstreetbets,Mods fucked up. Now every thread is a gme thread.

Maybe even leading to having to shut it down 🤷‍♂️"
2021-04-18 00:03:08,wallstreetbets,I heard someone say who gives a shit because this is supposed to be an anonymous message board.  If I told you to jump of a bridge do you think it is a good idea to do it?  Make a decision for yourself... not everything on the internet is truth.

2021-04-18 13:00:49,wallstreetbets,I follow u/NrdRage for actual DD's now. He offers weekly posts beyond the 3 usual tickers repeated on blast through this sub.
2021-04-18 12:23:18,wallstreetbets,"Because it's completely dominated this sub. And anyone who doesn't belong to the existing GME cult is getting downvoted into oblivion. It's choking out and suppressing actually helpful content. This stock is currently too highly valued to play. When I bought it in January for around $30, there was a potential for a short squeeze. It's dead now. So just let it go. There are other opportunities out there."
2021-04-18 02:43:32,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes you just gotta read between the lines. Clearly there is an outside factor, perhaps even an influence."

I can respect people’s opinions and decisions but this is Wallstreetbets and GME is shaping up to be the ballsiest, most historical bet ever put on Wall Street by retail investors.

It will be the only reason WSB will be known in 50 years and they’re removing the daily thread?"
2021-04-18 03:23:56,wallstreetbets,And there are 2 other subs for GME
2021-04-18 06:55:32,wallstreetbets,I joined in the midst of the GME and even I think majority of the folks don’t belong here!
2021-04-18 16:58:31,wallstreetbets,I have no stake in the game I just lurk here because I like seeing people lose money. And all the GME discussiosn literally have a religious fundamentalist feel behind it. Takes away the fun.

2021-04-18 02:30:27,wallstreetbets,No as it it wouldnt make sense to ban it

2021-04-18 16:07:52,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you, lol. But at the same time, I can understand them. They felt like the sub was turning into GMESTREETBETS."
2021-04-18 10:23:09,wallstreetbets,Which happens to align with DFV's final update post. I think shit's about to pop and they don't want to be again accused of market manipulation. Manipulation is only for hedge funds.

2021-04-18 16:17:33,wallstreetbets,"I get that, but it's not the first sub to undergo a significant change due to a sudden influx of new members. Mods have to learn to keep both members happy, allowing what the new members like without destroying the sub's roots. There was a ton of GME stuff because like 80% + users joined it for GME. I still see plenty of posts about other stocks though and deleting the GME Megathread is going to turn the rest of the sub into GMEstreetbets even moreso."
2021-04-18 16:51:25,wallstreetbets,"Still makes no sense. They still accept GME flood, but they remove the daily thread - which will invite to more GME flood. Doesn't feel a very smart strategy for me. I would have suggest the inverse, delete low effort GME posts and contain everything related in one single daily (weekly?) thread."

2021-04-18 09:24:47,wallstreetbets,keep picking up those bags friend
2021-04-18 09:28:02,wallstreetbets,Calling me friend doesn’t make me one. I’m sure your desperate for some
2021-04-18 09:54:02,wallstreetbets,just make sure you keep posting so i can keep track of the money you're losing based on the other wsb posters' extensive DD.
2021-04-18 09:59:09,wallstreetbets,"Again completely non sensical bullshit with absolutely zero relevance to anything said previously. At least try a bit harder if you’re that intent on trolling. 

Imagine the highlight of your life being an online troll and even completely utterly sucking at that."
2021-04-18 10:26:36,wallstreetbets,you're so brain-dead that you can't even follow the conversation we've been having?
2021-04-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Tbh I only trust retards. 
2021-04-17 20:26:40,wallstreetbets,This also applies to r/malefashionadvice
2021-04-18 01:25:57,wallstreetbets,The dudes on the left what you to throw money at dogde
2021-04-17 20:03:45,wallstreetbets,"Wizards know stuff and they wear capes with cool hats. Never trust a man in tight pants, his nuts can't breathe properly and neither can his thought process."
2021-04-17 20:04:56,wallstreetbets,You are definitely a retard for posting this as a video
2021-04-17 20:06:57,wallstreetbets,I don't think anybody believes they get advice from anybody who looks like they were privileged and born on Wall Street. Somebody from Wall Street wouldn't be supporting or leading any campaign against their kind.
2021-04-17 20:07:01,wallstreetbets,"So is this confirmation that the wizard of mad gains is actually real!?

I also see frodo diamond hands in the background his quest to hold that which paper hands can not was legendary."
2021-04-17 20:07:32,wallstreetbets,I mean... the guys on the left are tryharding and might be broke. The ones on the right either have lambos or do blowies underneath the bridge. I’ll take advice from weird lambo guy (could be a future dfv) over bridge blowies guy or tryhard corporate suit any day...
2021-04-17 20:07:39,wallstreetbets,A magician named Gob
2021-04-17 20:07:48,wallstreetbets,"Left side looks like a groom and his groomsmen, right side looks like fans at a Magic the gathering convention.

2021-04-17 20:14:26,wallstreetbets,I’ll be dressing like the ones on the left when this happens
2021-04-17 20:17:58,wallstreetbets,Lol no one here thinks the others look like the guys on the left.
2021-04-17 20:18:19,wallstreetbets,"Illusion, Michael."
2021-04-17 20:22:26,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-04-17 20:24:16,wallstreetbets,"What’s up with the main mega thread? Everyone is just at each other’s throat.

Don’t know why they would shut down a thread where everyone was partying and talking about who they would help out if/when GME squeezes....

2021-04-17 20:25:39,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure I see DumbledoreRothIRA there on the right
2021-04-17 20:25:47,wallstreetbets,Look into the future Merlin I need to yolo my life savings.
2021-04-17 20:27:54,wallstreetbets,I think it’s actually worse than the picture on the right.
2021-04-17 20:31:30,wallstreetbets,Nobody mistakes this group of retards for the guys in suits.  I'm guessing most don't make it out of their pajamas
2021-04-17 20:31:59,wallstreetbets,ILLUSION
2021-04-17 20:32:44,wallstreetbets,"To be honest, I do take the group on the right more seriously."
2021-04-17 20:35:22,wallstreetbets,Who are those men on the right?
2021-04-17 20:36:56,wallstreetbets,I’m autistic trust me
2021-04-17 20:39:16,wallstreetbets,I don’t even want to know what the women look like then.
2021-04-17 20:39:37,wallstreetbets,Retards unite!
2021-04-17 20:41:43,wallstreetbets,"I mean, thinking about what happened in 2008, those on the right seem more stable and trustworthy. But what do I know, I'm just an ape"
2021-04-17 20:42:26,wallstreetbets,"Can I finally comment in here?

Edit:omfg I’m honored. Just been trying to say.....APES STRONG TOGETHER!!!"
2021-04-17 20:44:15,wallstreetbets,Wait. You mean I'm not getting advice from some guy and his 4 best men?
2021-04-17 20:44:33,wallstreetbets,Y’all aren’t nearly as cool as the dudes on the right in that photo.
2021-04-17 20:46:56,wallstreetbets,Especially these days... the people on here now are so new and think they know more than the people doing this for 10 years. This sub is dead.
2021-04-17 20:47:03,wallstreetbets,Is that Libertarian presidential candidate Vermin Supreme??
2021-04-17 20:49:00,wallstreetbets,Fucking weebs

2021-04-17 20:56:41,wallstreetbets,I can say with great confidence the people on the left are retarded as well
2021-04-17 20:57:46,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure no one thought they were dealing with the left side pic....I mean, this is Reddit"
2021-04-17 21:03:14,wallstreetbets,Let me guess. Is DFV the wizard?

2021-04-17 21:18:26,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a Chili's.
2021-04-17 21:18:48,wallstreetbets,Can someone photoshop a hag witch on to the right as a representative for the women of WSB like myself
2021-04-17 21:20:50,wallstreetbets,And they all have a lot more money than me.
2021-04-17 21:24:43,wallstreetbets,I bet if I mentioned a game of quidditch they'd cum in their pants
2021-04-17 21:33:20,wallstreetbets,Guys on the right are usually the ones making the guys on the left look smart in the first place
2021-04-17 21:34:06,wallstreetbets,"Those people on the right do appear to be well-dressed and, relatively competent.  You're giving this sub too much credit."
2021-04-17 21:39:36,wallstreetbets,I wouldn’t have it any other way.
2021-04-17 21:42:13,wallstreetbets,This is literally god tier content

2021-04-17 22:30:42,wallstreetbets,Not sure I trust some bros at a wedding party either.
2021-04-17 22:32:51,wallstreetbets,"Anyone who ""dresses for success"" can't be trusted."

2021-04-17 22:51:35,wallstreetbets,I don't know. That wizard looks like he knows what he is talking about. And there is no way his wife has a boyfriend.
2021-04-17 22:52:38,wallstreetbets,Gamers are the next alphas
2021-04-17 22:52:46,wallstreetbets,This post was most definitely made by a fellow retard

2021-04-17 23:17:13,wallstreetbets,I'd honestly rather get advice from the right... The ones on the left look like absolute tools who obviously dont know how to wear suits
2021-04-17 23:20:15,wallstreetbets,As a business student I can confirm business people are the least trustworthy people you’ll ever meet (generally speaking).
2021-04-17 23:22:19,wallstreetbets,We are a fucking business man
2021-04-17 23:30:54,wallstreetbets,I’d take advice from a roaring kitty with a red bandana over a fucking suit any day.
2021-04-17 23:36:44,wallstreetbets,Kept zooming and it won’t.. just to realized it’s in video format. 😂
2021-04-17 23:53:23,wallstreetbets,"Inaccurate.

There would be way more dudes in wizard costumes if it accurately represented WSB"
2021-04-17 23:55:36,wallstreetbets,Would explain a lot tbh
2021-04-17 23:58:20,wallstreetbets,I thought we were apes.
2021-04-18 00:04:06,wallstreetbets,"Those gentlemen on the left look shifty AF!  
I wouldn't buy a pencil sharpener from them."

2021-04-18 01:10:48,wallstreetbets,I may be new to this subreddit because of gme but as a female and mom to somebody on the spectrum ya’ll need to do better.
2021-04-18 01:39:35,wallstreetbets,"I'd trust the dudes on the right more based on looks alone. The guys on the left look self-centered - they'd likely take my money and laugh at how dumb I was to trust them with it. On the other hand, the guys on the right look like they'd invest my money just like they would their own and then invite me to LARP with them or something.

Apes who LARP together MOON together - or something."
2021-04-18 01:41:59,wallstreetbets,"The joke is all the losing plays come from the guys on the left and all the profitable plays come from the guys on the right. Why? Because it is in the favor of the guys on the left to see you lose money, and it is in the favor of the guys on the right to see you make money."
2021-04-18 02:18:17,wallstreetbets,It’s failed me every time so far!
2021-04-18 02:35:44,wallstreetbets,Are the meatheads on the left supposed to be respectable stock analysts or something? They look like they’re about to go to a footy end of season award show and get shitfaced on rum and cokes.
2021-04-18 02:45:05,wallstreetbets,I'd rather take advice from the guys in the right!!!

2021-04-18 07:00:52,wallstreetbets,Tbh the best political debate happens in gaming forums. Politician can learn a thing or two from WoW players.

2021-04-18 19:49:55,wallstreetbets,where's the cat?
2021-04-18 19:51:02,wallstreetbets,Imagine being a wealthy retail trader and not even owning a wizard robe appropriate for dress occasions.

2021-04-17 21:19:29,wallstreetbets,"It's a gif. Open in browser, pinch and zoom. Bacon reader sucks at opening anything but jpeg."
2021-04-17 21:45:32,wallstreetbets,Had this on another thread. OP was as bewildered as the rest of us. You can see the scrub bar going 90 down the bottom on Reddit Sync on the front page. Looks fine in the thread but comes up as a gif in the bottom corner.
2021-04-17 21:48:05,wallstreetbets,It’s the most wsb thing ever to make this a video not a picture.
2021-04-17 21:54:20,wallstreetbets,The real questions are in the comments.
2021-04-17 22:19:48,wallstreetbets,What do you expect from a retarded ape

2021-04-18 10:52:29,wallstreetbets," So how can you tell the difference?
That would be the real point to make here for someone new like me.

I have an idea, why don't they put a list of who is a veteran in the redit group on the group rules page or something like that?   Would that be a goid idea?  Then at least you would be able to tell who was here before all the GME hype attracted so many new people..."

But they get the refunds AFTER the school gets paid completely for tuition and fees and housing (if living on campus) for the year.

Regardless, talk about fucking stupid. He has to pay that money back at a (likely) high interest %. He'd be better off just returning any excess towards his loans."

2021-04-17 20:09:25,wallstreetbets,I bought some at 8.75 and while I was researching it jumped hard. I did catch it on the way up like a big dumb monkey but I don’t care. I could’ve sold at 10 and didn’t because this is a 20 dollar play for sure. We’re looking at a gamma squeeze for sure and if it goes up to 20 shorts will go running no doubt

2021-04-18 01:55:00,wallstreetbets,"How was it ""exactly"" the moment GME was about to moon? The cult kept saying that every week. 50k or 100k extra shares by DFV are not contributing anything to the momentum. At this point just consider any piece of news about any ticker as suspicious, because every week you're expecting GME to ""squeeze"".

Compare the rhetoric of those bagholders with the crazy shit QAnon is saying and all the ""signs"" they're seeing. Yeah, pretty much the same."

2021-04-17 20:18:18,wallstreetbets,I think it is artificially suppressed by shorts for sure. The true float size is 108 million and not 145 million. Certainly not 405 million as most of those are non tradeable class b shares. So that works in the short squeeze favor dramatically. I think this is an easy $20 stock. Analysts have it as a minimum $13.25 stock. If this gets enough traction it is going to crush the shorts. I say best opportunity I’ve seen since GME hands down
2021-04-17 21:29:31,wallstreetbets,smells like shorts are going to get squeezed to 15-20 minimum. maybe as high as 30
2021-04-18 11:03:16,wallstreetbets,The best way is as GME taught us: 50% shares 50% may calls
2021-04-18 06:34:04,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-18 14:25:09,wallstreetbets,Yea. AH gave me a lot of conviction as well as finally sorting out all this data. 108 million shares outstanding. 40 million short as of mid day Friday. Quite possibly higher now with all the volume. If this blows past the 10 resistance I think we are looking at $15 easy. Maybe as high as 30-40
2021-04-18 10:34:06,wallstreetbets,I think it's a shit company and the Hindenburg research made more sense than it should. But yeah will still buy at <$7.5.

GME in two months ain't gone beat that if it goes well..."
2021-04-18 11:12:37,wallstreetbets,I think GME is just a long play now. It’s settled. Depends if you want to try and make some tendies on momentum. This has a lot of traction
2021-04-18 09:05:09,wallstreetbets,"Well, thats just wrong."

2021-04-17 23:56:22,wallstreetbets,"If you’re speaking on the DOJ inquiry I could see how that might present questions if you’re not educated in how healthcare insurance companies operate or the strict regulations. Speaking from experience (owning multiple pharmacies) I can tell you DOJ inquiries happen frequently when doing large scale business because healthcare experiences more fraud than any other sector. Especially when it comes to Medicare. 

I would suggest as with any stock do your due diligence. I’m sure just like the rest of us you will determine this is a growing company with strong revenues to support along with a great team of executives. The technology is disruptive and going to be a major attribute to the cms direct contracting model."
2021-04-18 00:04:03,wallstreetbets,"The SEC inquiry is officially a fraud inquiry.  Thar’s why I called it that.  That’s what it is.  The DOJ inquiry itself is not a big deal, agreed.  Failing to mention, perhaps intentionally, is the larger concern, and what has the SEC attention, hence their label of it being a fraud investigation.  

As I said, I don’t think its a major deal in and of itself.  However, it is not uncommon for a small issue being an indication of a sloppy due diligence before release.  Not suggesting it should rule out investing, but it should be part of the consideration."
2021-04-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Low effort COHU DD Cohu makes backend testing equipment for semiconductors. Cohu is the global leader in handlers with a share of 55% of the market. Their testing business continues to take market share from larger competitors, qorvo and skyworks. 

How does the business work? Cohu makes capital equipment for testing semi’s. They have two businesses, selling capital equipment to other firms, and offering testing to companies that want to outsource that process. 

We all know that there is a global semiconductor shortage, which is a strong catalyst. But the real catalyst is increasing volume. The number of semiconductors per phone is increasing. With 5g devices, there are nearly twice as many chips per phone as compared to 4g. This means twice as much testing. Additionally, with the move to electric vehicles, the automotive testing segment is growing rapidly. Cars that used to have only a few chips, are now crammed full of them. This trend of increasing chip volume is true for PC’s, phones, electric vehicles, self driving vehicles, IOT, cloud computing, and ai development. All of these growing industries have one thing in common, the need for lots of semiconductors to continue driving innovation. 

Financially cohu is a very attractive stock, even having nearly tripled in the past year. With a nice 42% profit margin and growing revenues, the company is still fairly priced. Ttm gross profit is 271 million, compared to their market cap of 2.3 billion. This is a market cap/profit ratio of 8.48. (So if you bought the whole company you’d make your principle back in 8.5 years and be able to sell for 100% profit assuming no change in valuation)."
2021-04-18 01:07:58,wallstreetbets,"I worked in the semi industry and can attest this, so far the main challenge for COHU is to remain relevant in the current 5G upgrade cycle, they have fierce competition from other players and their technology is behind, the one thing that works great for them is that 5G's rollout is delayed compared to the initial expectations and they are shameless when it comes to pursue a deal."
2021-04-18 02:28:09,wallstreetbets,"This company is not tied to the same massive movements like the developers.  $TECH is a reagent provider and grows as the industry grows.

2021-04-18 11:11:15,wallstreetbets,"I work for a school in Asia where Roblox is insanely popular and a lot of my students spend money in the game religiously. These kids have a stellar education and are also learning how to code from 6 years old.

If any place in the world would be clamoring to use Roblox as an educational tool then it would be here, but it just won't happen. It's a nice bit of padding to talk up the educational benefits of the game but in all honesty I don't think that'll amount to any additional interest or value in the stock. 

Gaming just isn't used in the classroom like that, at any level, and change happens very slowly in education. Steam Pedagogy is a non-starter I'm afraid, at least for the foreseeable.

I'm not saying this stock won't do well. I'm just saying it won't be for that reason."
2021-04-18 18:13:27,wallstreetbets,"Roblox is the only game/app that my 12, now 13 yo, daughter truly got addicted to, and I mean that in a bad, bad way. IMO p2w is f’ing lame but for her was like crack. Anecdotally I’m hearing the same from other parents. I gotta think parents’ willingness to spend cash on f’ing Robucks is gonna hit a wall sooner or later. First time ever unauthorized charges showed up on our cards (linked to ApplePay) from Jan to mid March. Never had spend problems with her before Roblox. 

Thankfully I was able to get refunds for those charges and literally bought 2 GME with the refunds, for real.  

She also blew whatever cash she had in her CashApp account. The only thing she didn’t do was sell her 2 AMC and she bought via CashApp on her 2nd attempt on that day when trading was halted, god bless WSB for teaching her to hold (seriously I’m not making that up)

As for the educational component of Roblox with schools I’m skeptical. But I’m also very biased so will watch with interest. 

All that said I was still seriously considering RBLX dpo long at 40-45 but it was way overvalued IMO and at this point I’m not touching it. 

Ahh, thanks for letting me rant. I feel much better now. :-)"

2021-04-17 21:06:08,wallstreetbets,"Depends on preferences.

If you only play games that are 10/10 graphics pc busters then sure.

Personally i like the cartoony aesthetic and the gameplay is smooth and solid with a clear cut progression system.

Have you looked at Garipalli’s previous business in making for profit hospital and what a mess that was?  And how much he profited out of that and never reinvested in hospital?  Old equipment, people paid poorly but he bought a mansion.

Clover is not about making health care affordable — it is about him making money."

I kinda think its more probable that 100000s of apes invent some conspiracy theories because they are overly invested in GME to keep it alive, than any of the complicated alternatives they throw around being true. A common and shared conspiracy theory is that hEdGe fUnDs hide in the derivative markets so that they don't have to report SI. Even if that were the case (and I doubt it, since this creates and ARB opportunity with cheap borrows), the media isn't wrong for reporting that SI is currently low for GME. And by the same metric CLOV is over shorted."

2021-04-18 01:08:11,wallstreetbets,"Basically what the other comment said. 100 warrants would be similar to buying an $11.50c (usually) LEAP. They are callable by the issuer typically if the stock averages above a certain price for so many days, so just keep that in mind."
2021-04-18 05:52:42,wallstreetbets,Clovw is the warrants ticker
2021-04-18 09:36:23,wallstreetbets,"They more or less trade like European options, but they can usually also be redeemed early. This makes it somewhat interesting for a squeeze as well. Its usually something like the stock needs to be above $20 dollar for 20 trading days or similar, then the warrants can be redeemed early (i.e. you can buy stock at $11.5). If the probability of an early redemption moves up, the warrant price will move closer to stock price - $11.5."
2021-04-17 23:14:47,wallstreetbets,You do realize a drop from 9 to 7 (-2$) is percentage wise the same as a drop from 150 to 116 (-34$).

2021-04-18 10:42:41,wallstreetbets,"Clover is pretty objectively undervalued at $9.00 given its current revenue. 

It has serious institutional backing, SPACs are easy to criticize. Clover isn’t the right one, and shouldn’t be mentioned along with frauds like Nikola. It’s dishonest.

2021-04-18 10:52:32,wallstreetbets,I didnt mean clov in particular. I was mocking the new crowd chanting fuck short sellers like they are some evil entity.  But without them doing research and what they're good at grandpa will have his retirement blown up when they stick all their money in something like nikola which is a fraud.
2021-04-18 13:30:07,wallstreetbets,I thought superducks was also criticising the activist element of the post — that mean shorties are trying to take away affordable healthcare for all — when clover is not about that — the company is not doing Medicaid as there is not enough money to be made off the poor.

After that they’re probably back on their feet again and making profit. BUT the reason why the share price won’t go to $15 for example is, that they needed money in the pandemic. That’s why they diluted 90 BILLION shares.. that’s right! The price dropped because there are so many shares available now.

YES THE VALUE OF AN ASSET DOESNT CHANGE JUST BECAUSE THE VALUE OF THE USD CHANGED. Just because the value of a currency has changed it doesnt mean the value of an asset has changed. It just means that the quantity of currency you need to procure has changed for you to get the same amount of value from the exact same asset. Yes you're right that the market will correct the value lose of the usd but just in QUANTITY not in value. A piece of land stays a piece of land, a stock stays a stock. Ofc i am assuming that there wont be heavy change of supply and demand just viewing the inflation isolated. But there wouldnt be a heavy change and supply and demand anyways. Now lets take this example : 1 Piece of Bread costs 1$. The FED decides some Simbabwe monkey shit and prints more Money (Money printing isnt really what causes hyperInflation, Its the liquidity of the central bank that actually causes hyperinflation and not being able to deffend the currency on the forex market, hit me up if you want some reference). Now 1 Piece of Bread costs 2$. Did the value of the bread change? No it did not! THIS IS NOT A CRASH UP in the sense you mean it. Its like calling 1 Centimetre, 10 milimetre. Just the reference has changed( yes european here with a good school system who had economics in highschool).
Anyways live long and proper monkey brain. Too much hate out there. Maybe shouldnt have called you monkey brain but i hope you learnt something and dont use stupid language like ""crash up"".

B:makes a wrongful/idiotic statement to A
C:corrects B which doesnt even need to be related to A

I think you dont even really realize what a hyperinflation really is about. You wont think about investing into the stock market, you will fight for the last piece of bread you find on the ground, therefore your first comment was also very stupid to begin with, Op never said buying puts in hope for a hyperinflation he just said puts dec 2022, maybe he just thought of a market crash. I dont think i am smart and i know that i am. You, on the other hand, are just retarded.

The set up is too public and the retail interest has never been so rampant, ever.  Correct me if I’m wrong about the retail interest part, I’d be curious to know what stock has captivated the market in a larger way than GME.

With trading now at the fingertips of the every day “investor” I believe we are entering a new age of how things get done. The straw that breaks the camels back will be GME."

2021-04-17 22:40:39,wallstreetbets,"My thesis actually conflicts with yours. My thesis is that they are trying to collapse tech and increase oil stocks by shorting bonds. The correlation has been there since April and maybe longer. My thesis is that the government wants to see inflation and the stock market go up steadily, but now they have to wait for a jump due to the people shorting bonds.    

Personally, I would point at Ken Griffin’s history with bonds and the deep understand of how bonds effect stocks. Followed by a deep look into their institutional holdings(specifically citadel) in cyclicals and deep history of shorting stocks. By using a few billion dollars to short bonds, it would be possibly to profit trillions by shorting tech and buying cyclicals."

He literally defaulted into the role because the previous CEO ""BK"" was kicked out, due to a ""consensual relationship with an employee"", which probably was true, but in reality he was kicked out for fucking up 10nm so bad.  Intel did a CEO search for months, and at the time couldn't find anyone they wanted for the job.  Murthy Redunchintala wanted the position, but the Board did not want him to have it.  So Bob defaulted in.  He never was a tech visionary and I think he was just maintaining the ship while the company tried in vain to sort itself out with other hires."

This is for reduced capacity and reduced hours 9-7 vs 8-midnight. The Grand Californian is charging $800/nt for a room that you can beat at an Embassy Suites.  The Mouse is going to the moon.

2021-04-18 06:36:39,wallstreetbets,DIS is a buy and hold but WSB are looking for a 10X in the next month.
2021-04-17 23:00:35,wallstreetbets,"You optimism is misplaced and you seriously miss the negatives.. Disney is massively overvalued.
    
1. Parks revenue decreased 99% in 2nd quarter of 2020.   3 of 6 open about 50% of the population will NOT get that stupid vaccine that has a 99.97% survival rate for those under 50.
    
2. Disney cruises closed until November I believe. Meaning many Disney resorts will flounder.
    
3. Disney Star Wars is massively underperforming, Galaxy's Edge is a flop, actually caused attendance to drop!
    
4. Disney hotel and resorts under booked. Mostly locals going to parks.  Limited capacity. Scaled back 50th anniversary celebration.
Many new rides delayed, 2 new SW hotels scaled down.
    
5. Disney+ is no longer a threat to Netflix. Netflix used to consider Dis+ #3 but now dropped them to 5... According to Netflix internal analysis its 1) Netflix, 2)Amazon 3) Hulu 4)Hbomax 5) Disney+ 6) Tubi.
    
6. ESPN has had millions of subscribers cancel due to leftist woke politics.

    
 Those vaccines are having difficulty, delays, recalls, high mortality than all vaccines for the past 10 yrs.. There is still massive restrictions on travel, Disney cruises still shutdown until November. The 2 Star Wars hotels will be catastrophic flops like GE, extremely overpriced, limited appeal, limited pool of people that can afford once let alone repeat.     
     
 Galaxy Edge has massively underperformed, had constant ride breakdowns, boring.. Got lots of backlash for omitting the OT and PT.   Kathleen Kennedy has been a disaster to the SW IP... Just when Mandalorian was rebuilding the fandom, KK nukes Mandalorian by firing Gina Carano, ignoring OT actors, insulting half the country by pushing divisive politics... lucasfilm employees has numerous social media fiascos. The official SW channel cant post anywhere without being downvoted to oblivion. The High Republic is a flop.    
    
KK announced a huge slate of SW projects but she has a history of firing directors and doesnt understand SW at all and only uses it as a vanity project to push her ideology.     
        
 Mandalorian the show that broke the Disney+ servers with Luke Skywalkers return by firing Gina Carano,  caused a 2 year delay in The Mandalorian  and has lost tens of thousands of subscribers or much more. So many quit that Disney+ will not giving  updates anymore.. The backlash caused Wandavision to nosedive and Falcon and Wintersoldier to massively underperform to due to pushing SJWand BLM politics into it.. The MCU is becoming the M-She-U.and they hired political people who dont know comics, the characters or Marvel. Marvel comics is dying, they current writers insult and have driven off much of the fandom. We should be in a Silver Age renaissance of comics, instead comics are driving people away looking for fictional twitter/tumblr crowd who arent fans and dont buy the product.
Marvel Studios now blamed Lucasfilm for the underperforming.
    
  The people in charge constantly push politics. The female exec doesnt want to use the Xmen label anymore, one of the most icon brands since it's not inclusive. That type of mentality runs through Disney now. Another female exec is openly refusing to produce shows for "" white, Christian, trash"" even if well written, want to make shows to lecture not entertain. 
    
ABC has few hit shows and the few okay shows are aging.
    
Disney has created possibly a new rival in Tubi, flush with cash, its acquiring lots of IPs and making original programming. Meanwhile Disney is saddled with debt from acquisitions, civic, etc. Lots of bad publicity with Milan, HK and concentration camps.
     
Almost all their injuries are self inflicted. 
    
MCU stage 4, Black Panther 2 lost its star, Brie Larson is not popular, Eternals would have flopped if released. 
    
Read up on PiratesandPrincesses.net and watch Overlord DVD on youtube to get the other side and inside scoop. Disney is maybe worth $60 right now.."
2021-04-17 20:15:12,wallstreetbets,Shit my kid can’t even talk and I’m itching to go to Disney lol.
2021-04-17 20:17:56,wallstreetbets," people have changed their ways. the pandemic has made people less reliant on travel to fulfill their escapism needs. The hunkering down for + year has changed the attitudes of typical consumer. I don't know how much of an effect it will have, but it Is rael."

2021-04-17 23:36:42,wallstreetbets,No calls???
2021-04-17 23:35:38,wallstreetbets,"Dis should be at all time highs given the success of Disney plus and should be higher than $187 right now. Looking at ath pre covid at around $151 in Nov 2019 to $187 today, suggests to me that DIS is undervalued now. I love the move into Hulu and I think this gets ignored. As cable continues to decline, Hulu will rise along with the rest of streaming.  My own semi retarded calculation on dis value comes to a fair market value of 400b right now."

2021-04-18 19:16:41,wallstreetbets,Making around 200USD a week. My average is 11. It’s not much but I was in for the long run and this pays the bills just sitting there. Not that I actually need the money so it just goes in to buy more share to average down my position.

2021-04-17 20:05:52,wallstreetbets,That's right
2021-04-18 10:46:33,wallstreetbets,"Tricky and risky to do in a TFSA investing vehicle. If you take a loss you lose your contribution room forever. Also you're only allowed to add $6000/year or your total contribution room since inception. , So depending on his other investments he may be maxed out already and can't average down. This is why I use my TFSA for robo ETF investing and just use a cash account for speculations."
2021-04-18 17:44:22,wallstreetbets,"Yeah TFSAs are really risky to yolo on. If your yolo goes good? Badfuckingass, continue growing that sucker tax free for years to come with an insane balance. 

Blow your yolo and have a massive loss? Your TFSA room is gone and you only get 6k more room a year to use. Bye Felicia"

2021-04-18 14:35:55,wallstreetbets,"If his call option strike is higher than the buyout price, then his options become worthless"
2021-04-18 14:40:46,wallstreetbets,"That I understand but if the price rises those options are worth more, can't he just sell them?  Not hold till expiry.  The person above said buyout price at 20% premium possibility.  If that scenario plays out wouldn't all his calls be worth more than what he purchased them at?"
2021-04-18 14:42:55,wallstreetbets,"The current stock price is ~$40, a 20% premium is a $48 buyout price. His lowest call option strike is $55, meaning that any call option above $48 becomes worthless, because if the acquisition goes through, it will never go above $48"
2021-04-18 14:48:48,wallstreetbets,Those are almost 2 year leaps man.  He can just sell the option right?  He doesn't need to hold them.  Assuming there are buyers.
2021-04-18 14:51:04,wallstreetbets,"Yep, he can sell the options, but the option price will be worthless like I said due to a ceiling on the share price based on that example. To add, time (theta) doesn’t matter anymore, because the delta will never get there.

I’m not saying there will be a buyout or making any suggestion, just calling out what would happen in that example."
2021-04-18 15:04:06,wallstreetbets,Yeah I agree about the 48 price cap in the hypothetical scenario of a buyout and it won't move until after the deal goes through like what's happening with NUAN.  If a rumour or deal of a buyout causes a spike in price I would immediately attempt up sell all these calls.  I don't know if there will be buyers but I would attempt to sell them.  The price in the options chain should be up in the price movement?  Or is that not how it works?
2021-04-18 15:20:52,wallstreetbets,"If rumors of a buyout then yes options price will spike, but once the buyout price is known then any option strike above buyout price will be chopped"

2021-04-17 20:13:01,wallstreetbets,"I don't do otr anymore. I work local and am home every night. My gig involves delivering to construction sites. It's a mud and gravel lot and often the address isn't on a gps. 

Good luck automating that!

As for layover pay they required you to be idle for 48 hours before they paid you for the last 24. 20 years ago layover pay was 40 $ a day. And you can bet if the dispatcher was paying attention I'd get a dispatch to pick up a load 2 days later during the 47th hour. Happened all the time. When I worked for Swift I had to write down everything's that I did and was supposed to get paid for. They would ""forget"" to pay for things on every paycheck. Pack of fucking thieves.

Trucking companies advertise about how many new jobs are going to be needed but in reality most of those openings are from high turnover rate. In OTR drivers are just a piece of meat behind the wheel. They've bolstered their numbers by hiring more immigrants. These are folks who often are used to being treated like shit.

I think most carriers are perfectly fine with laying off their drivers and going fully automated.

Back in 99, CFI laid off all it's owner operators without notice. The next day they offered to rehire them without health insurance. 

I'll never drive otr again. 2000 was the last year I did it."
2021-04-17 22:46:11,wallstreetbets,"Few years ago I saw mention of driverless Long Haul rigs that pulled up to Hubs for a driver to get into the truck for ""Last Mile"" somewhere. If they are paying them Cut Rate for short trips who knows what the future might look like."
2021-04-18 00:23:42,wallstreetbets,"Hell even if they're paying them well, the company would still come out ahead because each driver would be effectively moving 10x as many trucks."

2021-04-18 11:15:32,wallstreetbets,"Stream schedules, if your content is good and you're not growing it's because you don't stream in regular intervals so you leech the viewers you already have over time.  I haven't streamed in ages myself but had a decent number of followers and regular viewers mostly from c++/asm dev streams (mostly around ludum dare), and picked up a weirdly large (though not massive) following at one point doing random challenge streams in games.  I did it long enough to see though that when you keep a schedule you gain pretty easily but once you go off you start dropping fairly quickly as well.

&#x200B;

Oh and interact/talk, even if nobody's watching, describe what you're doing or something, people don't hang around in streams where the streamer is silent."

2021-04-17 20:49:50,wallstreetbets,This smells like WALL STREET gonna sell some calls and they going to be $0.00 at some point. This just does not feel right with a PUT / CALL 0.20 ratio.  GME was not this imbalanced when it took off. Six weeks under $9 .. MaxPain is $10 ... The volume of trade last week was enormous and the stock only rose 7.4% and stayed under the resistance shown for weeks? You are going to need a lot of luck I believe. This is much different than when GME took off. Back then people were not fully invested and looking for the next awesome thing.
2021-04-18 02:01:38,wallstreetbets,Good enough to screenshot good enough to sell..  Hope premarket Monday doesn't hurt these beauties

2021-04-18 07:39:31,wallstreetbets,"GME was not a sound business prior to the shorting (and still isn't yet). It made sense to short it in all honesty. It was a stale B&M store with barely any digital presence save for an archaic website, and was known for its garbage customer service, and crappy business tactics. The only reason the GME squeeze was successful was due to the significant amount of shorting.

I'm not saying they are the same company anymore. They are restructuring significantly now to position themselves as a business that can function in the digital age, but if they don't change things (like they are planning on doing) they are doomed to fail."

2021-04-18 14:39:27,wallstreetbets,"Sure because no one in their right mind believes it’s going back to 350 or 480. So you take your 30 mil rather than watch 2/3rds of it evaporate.

Odds are he will sell covered calls to the retard crew here and milk them for awhile and sell out before the share holder meeting.

That’s why it’s a final update, because the minute he sells retards here will be out for blood, and his real identity is out there.

Think a little. No ones going to leave 20m on the table"
2021-04-18 14:41:32,wallstreetbets,"No, why don’t you think a little. He had every opportunity to cash out 40 mil less than a month ago, and you think he’s going to spend another 7m at $154 to sell at $160? God I hope you spend some time in the gym getting healthy, because if you’re this dumb, and ugly, fuck."
2021-04-18 14:54:24,wallstreetbets,"Oh I’ve thought about it plenty, and I am sure he has a lawyer advising him.
He’s also the guy that admitted to liking the price at 40$something to Congress, so probably in a pretty tough position. 
And he’s kinda the face of this thing along with a bunch of other daily posters in SS. 
And I think when retail traders take their inevitable ridiculous loss here, they’re going to go screaming and crying to social media. 
I also think if it was me and I was sitting on what is it 36 or 38 million with shares and cash I’d be willing to eat a little (while earning some back via CC) to make it look good and insulate myself from the coming storm.

You notice he hasn’t done a DD video in a long long time right. You think that’s out of choice or because he spoke with the SEC?

2021-04-18 06:21:38,wallstreetbets,"Where does that 65% figure come from? 

https://news.gamestop.com/stock-information/institutional-ownership

Over 70% institutional from just the top holder figures on their website, which aren't present day, but they surely haven't changed *that* much. 13% is RC's company, roughly 30% seems to be index fund custodians (some might be active management within those companies), and roughly 30% seems to be private equity funds.

2021-04-18 19:40:55,wallstreetbets,"I now have GME shares with 4 different brokers.

I plan to sell them with each broker (leaving 1 share in each account), in 10% lots for each 10% rise or fall in price AFTER they do something to meaningfully impact my free exercise (most likely prevent access to the platform through ""maintenance""). 

I expect all my brokers to fail and have to restrict trading at some point, the later the better obviously. 

I would like to maintain 101 shares in one brokerage to sell covered calls, and sufficient cash to sell cash secured puts for the months to come when I expect IV to be over 1000%."
2021-04-18 19:44:53,wallstreetbets,Wow. Nice. Are you confident in price per share hitting $10million+

They had a fight where a 180 lbs karate dude fought a 500 lbs sumo wrestler. Lol i think the karate dude won too iirc because he landed a lucky blow and broke the sumo guy's nose.  They also used to have insane hair pulling and fish hooking. Still remember too when Sen. John McCain tried to ban it because it was 'pit fighting'.

2021-04-17 20:47:59,wallstreetbets,"My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year-old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet.  

My father would womanize, he would drink. He would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes, he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament.  

My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring, we’d make meat helmets.

When I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds – pretty standard, really. At the age of twelve, I received my first scribe.  

At the age of fourteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. At the age of 18, I went off to evil medical school. At the age of 25, I took up tap dancing. I wanted to be a quadruple threat — an actor, dancer…

2021-04-18 08:58:23,wallstreetbets,"Long term forecast DD: 2 possible outcomes.

1. We are not in a bubble, in which case markets slowly continue making ATH as they have done for the past few decades.

2. We are in a bubble. Then we're only at the start of one. Why? There has been no exponential, year on year growth as it was the case in 1996-1999 yet. And that is despite the 25% of all money ever printed in the past 365 days. We have growth, yes, but not exponential growth and this is probably the biggest sign as to why we're not in the middle or towards the end of the bubble. It's why even Burry and Buffet are massively long instead of short. There won't be a massive crash for years to come, but there will of course be small pullbacks.

This weekend DD has been brought to you by a proud bag holder of SPCE at 35 average."

2021-04-18 15:02:53,wallstreetbets,"**How much $25k invested in SPY in March 2020 is worth today?**

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On March 23 the price of **SPY 6/18/21 $320** strike leap calls was **2.50**. Lets say we used $25k to buy 100 contracts and hold until expiration.

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the last price of **98.00** which gives us a total value of:

#$980,000

No TA and no DD needed. Invest in a boring index **on a dip** and you can secure your retirement.

My personal take on my own investments : 

1) \~ 60 % long-term low cost ETF’s ( one S&P, one Growth, one Hi Tech/Innovative Tech )

2) \~ 20 - 25 % dividend stocks  ( PPL, PRU, MAIN, BNS, DUK, BCE et al ) - for constant new 

investable money by incoming dividends

 3) \~ 15 - 20%   speculative higher risk/reward stocks ( BLOK, RBLX , COIN )

 4)  Many of you will not like this , but I do not employ margin, options , futures or any  other

forms of leverage in my accounts as I have seen it backfire horribly  way too often on way 

too many people.

In a bear market leverage can destroy you, and do so very quickly.

I may be one of the older members , the ones often made fun of,  but I sincerely love the

The driver then skips half the course by mistake and “gets lost in the desert.” Upon returning to the correct part of the course, they begin driving backwards which would’ve put other drivers in danger if not for the fact that they were already in dead last. Oh and then they dropped out of the race.

Nothing is a surefire bet, but so much positive news for Disney all centered around the end of April plus their earnings 2 weeks into May. 

Get your calls in and I hope I, and whoever follows suit makes money. 

They should be worth double  NFLX as we go through reopening. D+ is the strongest competitor to NFLX as a must have, and their parks and other recreational stuff does double digits billions in rev. So this reopening is much needed and should be reflected in their price.

In @ Apr 30th 190c. Last week action has been very positive. So unless the markets dump, money is there to be made.

2. Go to the gym. You don’t have to be OptionsAndTren, but nobody is physically attracted to overweight basement dwellers.

3. Be hygienic.

4. Get really good at that hobby because you enjoy the hobby. Mastery of a hobby builds confidence.

5. Find women with similar interests to your own, or who admire your new confidence and give you a shot.

6. Stop focusing so much on getting a GF and more on having a good time. Desperation is stinky.

2021-04-18 12:50:14,wallstreetbets,"Maxing out with SPY is a good choice. Yields historically are I think around 15% yearly on average (until the bull market stops obviously). You could also try high yield dividend stocks with good IVs so that you could both cash in those dividends and sell OTM weekly cc's on them. Go to r/investing and r/options if you want to learn about those things though, this isn't a WSB thing."

If indeed the float math works out and lots of A shares hold on.  The squeeze is on.

My take: I'm buying a small number of shares.  It's a beaten down stock so the downside risk doesn't seem that big.  IV is high so I won't get fucked by theta like with options.

This seems like one of those ""small risk, if it doesn't pan out just sell.""  Like tails small loss, but if the squeeze happens you print."

When one of them gets bought at a high premium, it invites a new look at their valuations and promotes a re rating of the whole sector or at least sub sector (

ie when someoen buys an oncology biotech at 30% premium, many of the viables ones jump because it strongly suggests that a detailed review of the market for oncology has led to this valuation)"

They were the first to cut and run on Archegos, all while RUNNING the VIAC share offering. They were dumping Archegos before anyone else while also making money off of facilitating the VIAC share offering. They didn't pretend to be slick. They minimized losses, got paid to do it, and screwed their competition."

2021-04-18 11:58:45,wallstreetbets,"I don't know anyone can know when the dip has dipped and I don't have day trade capabilities so I'll just say what I'm going to say but understand this is all theory and I'm leaning on other people here for the experience.  ( i too have sold early and lost much profitable opportunity, bu also I have sold early and kept losses, so I try not to focus on ""what could have happened."" ) 

My thought process is here say you buy in at 100 and put a trailing stop -20.   So if it moves up to 150 and then bounces back to 130 and stops you out for a profit.  When would you buy in and know that the ""dip has dipped"".  There's not an exact recipe but I would imagine when it has turned around started going back up, say it hit 90, then ran back to 100, that might be your re-buy in with a stop loss of say, -20 again.   

So maybe it's not realistic, but to me, on paper, it sounds well.  I hope to be able to test it one day."

2021-04-17 22:54:01,wallstreetbets,That’s my logic. Dude owes me years of support he never gave me. He can keep paying hoping for reconciliation but I think at this point he knows it isn’t happening. It’s never life changing money either so if it stops idgaf but it’s my own way of slightly getting even.
2021-04-17 22:55:06,wallstreetbets,Good luck!
2021-04-17 23:08:39,wallstreetbets,"Just, be wary. If you're not discounting reconciling at some point you could damage the chances of that if he has an ulterior motive at the moment. I don't know your situation, but it might be worth finding out *why* he's sent that large an amount if it's abnormal."

2021-04-17 20:44:39,wallstreetbets,Why would you come in and decide what should happen with WSB when you didn’t fucking know it existed 3 months ago.  Most of us lurked for months to learn the culture before contributing to the community (over a year ago).  The problem with you self proclaimed 🦍 is that you expect the 2 million OGs to assimilate to YOU.  While you district our linguistics and culture.

2021-04-18 13:23:15,wallstreetbets,"“Cool with it” isn’t the same as keeping a cool head about it. If unpinned stayed and megathread goes we all know what would happen...they’d rush here and/or scream injustice. You remember how bad it got for everyone last time they tried.

So I *want* unpinned, but understand why we can’t have it. I still personally think it has its place and I hope we can prove it out in the future again but who knows - at least we can still use this thread for a long time. I also think we can’t stay here during market hours next week. The daily is going to be too important."

2021-04-18 01:59:09,wallstreetbets,"This stock is the financial equivalent of a ruined orgasm. I bought a little before it took off to $40 and then bought again after it crashed because $40 still seemed low given just how sound their business is. Ever since I've been averaging down both by buying more and selling calls. I still don't have a while lot, just a couple LEAPS and about 125 shares, but it's enough for a ticket on this bandwagon. Plus my basis is so low at this point it could do nothing and I'd still come out ahead.

IMO earnings might be the catalyst since as OP said every time they catch any volume the stock takes off like an actual rocket and volatility is always juicier around earnings. I've noticed as we've crept closer to May it's gotten more and more unstable."

""*On April 16th, 2021 gave ""Seekingalpha"" the True of Scorpion Capital after stocks of QS were falling down with 13%. You can read it:*

*""QuantumScape said it stood by its data, describing Scorpion as a financially-incentivized short seller"" that was looking to ""short a stock, follow with a negative 'report,' make money on their short position, and quickly cover to lock in their gains.""*

*In a word: it turned the true out. Scorpion Capital did spread fake, false news about QS, they accused of QS with ""lie"" but they are lying in order to make money by spreading bad news, pulling the stock price down because they did short-selling. Scorpion Capital plays with unfair and even vile means. The ""hyenas"" of the financial profession.

But remember this short report says that VW only received powerpoint slides, whereas the news release says they actually tested the battery in labs in Germany. Both cannot be true and yet the short report is completely silent as to this news release. Also the short report does not give any detail about who these employees are or when they left. To me it comes more across as Scorpion Capital getting some ex-employees to say the most extreme things about the company so they can put that down on paper and cover themselves legally when the company or the SEC comes after them."

2021-04-18 08:45:02,wallstreetbets,"I didnt mean to trigger you guys but it doesn't take a genius to see the difference between a dying market and a growing market. All you told me right now is that they paid off their debt and theyre not going to go bankrupt anymore. While nndm has over a $billion in cash for the purpose of acquiring other companies to speed up r&d and production.
I'm not going to talk much about nndm because that's not the purpose of this post but all video games are becoming digital which means gamestop has to somehow sell something other than games. Every gamestop that I have ever been to has displayed scummy business practices to take advantage of their customers. Unless GME has a fundamental change in how they conduct business and decides to sell the customer an experience i.e. local gaming events, retro games, collectibles, merch. Then there's no reason people(gamers) are going to have a reason to shop there which means the business will die. 
Obviously none of this is relevant if your just investing in short term but I think I should have prefaced all of this with saying it doesn't make sense to invest in gme long term at this price.
Honestly I would like to hear an opinion from a longterm investor of gme and why they're investing in gme and what kind of future they see for gme and if they think its a good time to invest in gme or to just hold for a year. The only people I've been seeing talk about buying gme are short interest or related to screwing over hedgefunders which isn't really long term"

Before you say anything, yes I'm aware blackberry doesn't deal with phones anymore and that they're a iot company.

2021-04-18 10:12:14,wallstreetbets,"You’re going off public sentiment as well w NNDM. Public sentiment brings volume and I made a lot of money day trading BB during the spike, so my losses don’t actually reflect the reality of the situation. Harnessing public sentiment can be profitable.

As for revenue growth. I do use it to base my investments..once again, BB’s forward guidance in their statement said that they’re expecting 11-30% revenue growth across their various sectors. They have BB Ivy coming next year which will lead to an increase in perceived value and I think it’s absolutely undervalued trading at 4x revenue. Their competitors trade 40x revenue, so once their public image shifts, I expect growth. I’ve mentioned before but I plan to hold these to 2030 because of their pivot info software and IVY, I see them at 70B market cap easily one day."
