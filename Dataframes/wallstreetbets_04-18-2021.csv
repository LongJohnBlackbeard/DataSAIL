2021-04-18 18:26:07,wallstreetbets,It was almost all....Too Simple.
2021-04-18 18:20:10,wallstreetbets,Thank god you were here to crack the case. You‚Äôve single handedly uncovered a conspiracy to create a public company and rob investors blind. Good job.
2021-04-18 19:30:44,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I'm not looking forward to a future where human drivers have skill fade and can't cope in an emergency because of lack of practice driving.  My back up camera gets mud on it frequently enough that I'm skeptical about all these sensors working consistently well to reduce the average accident rate."
2021-04-18 19:29:20,wallstreetbets,So Cathie Wood and Co. made a mistake purchasing all those shares.
2021-04-18 18:24:29,wallstreetbets,Im waiting on [Plus.Ai](https://Plus.Ai) to announce its Spac Merger.  They seem to be pretty legit.
2021-04-18 18:34:02,wallstreetbets,"I disagree. I'm a truck driver and have been following them for a long time. AF is the future and they're the best bet. Here's a [Reuters Article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-tusimple-investment-idUSKCN1V51EU) from back in 2019. Amazon, UPS, Budweiser, US Express and others are invested. They've been testing their trucks on their routes."
2021-04-18 18:49:13,wallstreetbets,Tusimple is legit. They have contracts to retrofit other trucks for other companies. You think these big truck companies wouldn‚Äôt do DD on weather this company is legit?
2021-04-18 18:52:25,wallstreetbets,"Their ""partners"" haven't been testing their trucks, their only current customers have outsourced freight routes to them, nobody is using their trucks.

Amazon, UPS, etc. have all ""pre-ordered"" trucks... for a $500 deposit.

TuSimple hasn't even made a single truck."
2021-04-18 19:22:04,wallstreetbets,"Might be the future, but OP is calling this company out quite accurately."
2021-04-18 19:11:26,wallstreetbets,"There's a dozen other self driving truck companies. Ike (acquired by Softbank's Nuro), Embark, Plus.ai , etc. This isn't a solved problem, clearly shown with Tusimple burning 128m w/ 1.8 in total revenues. They're no where worth 8b."
2021-04-18 18:59:00,wallstreetbets,Tell the goev people
2021-04-18 19:07:16,wallstreetbets,"The ""contracts"" are $500 pre-orders for 2024, they haven't built a single truck."
2021-04-18 19:24:02,wallstreetbets,DD doesn‚Äôt solve the immediate tech limitations OP accurately described. Unless they have better tech than space aliens they can‚Äôt do 1000 meter anything.....
2021-04-18 19:13:48,wallstreetbets,"Hi OP, just poke one of us if you get caught again"
2021-04-18 19:42:27,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the effort into this, and I have just one main question without getting too too far into the weeds:

Ok, SPY is up 48% YTD.  So if I had $100k a year ago and leveraged 2:1, I could‚Äôve bought $200k of SPY.  At a 48% return, I would‚Äôve made $96,000, or a 96% annual return on my initial $100k.  Compared to your 108% annualized return, this isn‚Äôt too far off.

My question - how is your strategy that much different from ‚Äúleverage at 2:1 into some good index funds‚Äù?

I am just a retard asking retarded questions, so I may have totally missed something, but please help me understand the best you can üôè"
2021-04-18 19:57:09,wallstreetbets,"Well written. Based on your logic, smart beta seems to be your guiding factor. What is your reasoning behind this?"
2021-04-18 19:37:09,wallstreetbets,isnt pin risk still an issue with any box trading?
2021-04-18 19:14:04,wallstreetbets,!wsbgold
2021-04-18 19:49:09,wallstreetbets,"SPY is not up 48% YTD, I think you just meant 1 year return? It‚Äôs not that different in theory, you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm just much more optimistic about a global portfolio of smart beta over just SPY. VFMF for in strange is up 65% for the past year, so a substantial part of my returns have been from the ETFs themselves, not just the leverage. That‚Äôs why SPY is up 35% over the period I show above, while I‚Äôm up 90% (much more than just twice). Not a dumb question at all!"
2021-04-18 19:59:47,wallstreetbets,"Value quality and momentum show up in basically every asset class, in every country, for as long as we have data (very pervasive and statistically significant). I fully agree with the intuition behind what they should continue and the diversification benefits. So it‚Äôs a big part of my approach"
2021-04-18 19:39:01,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an issue at all with European options like SPX right? They just get cash-settled based on their strike price and the underlying index value at the moment they expire.
2021-04-18 19:15:05,wallstreetbets,Ur da man zjz!
2021-04-18 19:41:19,wallstreetbets,"haha, i guess not. was wondering why anyone would want those other than favorable tax treatment now i have a valid use case. :)"

2021-04-18 18:10:06,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm going to wait till it hits $100 and THEN panic buy, my wife‚Äôs boyfriend wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way."

2021-04-18 17:51:38,wallstreetbets,"Ok the data adds up.
I'm still riding out the gme/amc train. If this still in the 7-10$ ratio by end of next week I'm in since I'm waiting for my paycheck rn"
2021-04-18 16:48:28,wallstreetbets,Buy a little $CLOV just in case it turns into a mini-$GME. Nothing to lose
2021-04-18 18:18:09,wallstreetbets,$CLOV to $50
2021-04-18 18:19:23,wallstreetbets,Fuck it. Threw a few hundred into it. Lesgooo
2021-04-18 18:04:48,wallstreetbets,Had some money in my WeBull account so I‚Äôm in for 5 shares. Babyüíéüëê here we go!
2021-04-18 17:53:15,wallstreetbets,"$CLOV is easily going north of $10 and back to $12-15 territory without the short factor, the short factor just makes it another possible AMC where it can go triple what it is today, this whole short interest just put it on the map as the possible next meme stock

&#x200B;

I do have position in CLOV but I got in after it crashed on Friday from the corrected numbers"
2021-04-18 16:41:40,wallstreetbets,Got 10 shares at 7.5 on Friday as a fluke before the media and WSB hopped on. I‚Äôll hold for a bit see what happens. Was already up 30% in one day which was interesting to watch.
2021-04-18 17:55:57,wallstreetbets,I made some cash off it Friday right before the market closed and again in the after-hours. If people like it and are willing to spend their hard-earned cash on it then so be it. I'm buying more on Monday.
2021-04-18 16:59:01,wallstreetbets,Go half shares and have 5/21 calls. Take our GME lessons and apply it here. I‚Äôm in for 120k. 100k in shares and 20 in calls. Gonna buy more calls tomorrow because gamma squeeze is important here. Thank you for the DD
2021-04-18 17:15:40,wallstreetbets,Honestly tho it's so far off its highs and its been shorted to death... feels pretty obvious at 9 dollars
2021-04-18 16:56:34,wallstreetbets,"still holding 400 shares at $13, near the merger.

I would like this to be $69 by EOY"

2021-04-18 17:19:56,wallstreetbets,"After egregiously shorting it back down after the Vanguard 18% buy, I knew shorts had just gotten over their head. They ALWAYS dump it down on good news, it's such a basic mind-fuck; if your stock doesn't survive good news then it must be toast right?"
2021-04-18 16:43:45,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm a believer. Hoping to buy more tomorrow.
2021-04-18 18:26:21,wallstreetbets,"I was holding some CLOV anyway and bought a little more on Friday during the run up. Shortsellers trying to put any company who is not entirely fraudulent out of business is worth punishing. And making money while doing it, why not?"
2021-04-18 18:29:05,wallstreetbets,Anyone no where I can buy $CLOV in Ireland? Seems to be quite hard to find
2021-04-18 17:38:09,wallstreetbets,Also let‚Äôs get this out there: this is a 3B market cap. We can stomp these shorts SO easily. By comparison RKT was 24 billion

2021-04-18 17:46:16,wallstreetbets,Anything preceded with ‚Äúno bullshit‚Äù is an insta-buy in my book üëçüèΩ
2021-04-18 18:50:08,wallstreetbets,"Here is my one and only concern regarding this (i profited Friday and left some in over weekend for possible squeeze) the short share borrow rate is insanely low and there are millions of lendable short shares. I‚Äôm slightly confused on how all of the numbers add up. Most squeezed I have witnessed get close to zero shorts available and usually have a high borrow rate. If the float is shorted in the 100s or even the 30s, why is the borrow rate so low? Does not make sense. Maybe someone smarter than me can explain."
2021-04-18 18:36:12,wallstreetbets,"We aren‚Äôt here to ‚Äúfight back against the hedgies...‚Äù or any similar kind of political movement.  This is a sub of degenerates who try to get rich fast by making outlandish bets.

2021-04-18 18:08:17,wallstreetbets,"Omg thank you!!!! I was posting about this on friday on gme mega thread and immediately people were bashing on me saying i was trying to distract from gme... I was not distracting i was simply saying hello we need to look at this its important due to the same gme squeeze effect. Im so glad this is cleared up. So i say to fight back, chamath is on our side and a good person. Clov is a good stock and doesn't deserve to be shorted so massively and under priced. I saw it at 148% Friday. Screw these shorters lets not let them win and save clov. I like the stock to! $CLOV to $100!"
2021-04-18 17:56:18,wallstreetbets,I wonder if this was part of those stocks they were trying to pay people to push recently because of the sec money to cover by April 22nd

https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2018/04/14/fatal-collision-i-476/

2021-04-18 17:40:18,wallstreetbets,"The goal is never going to be to create a perfect autopilot system with 100% safety & a 0% crash  rate - it is to make a system that performs better than human beings. If right now the average accident & fatal accident statistics were, hypothetically, 1 of every 75,000 trips in an automobile resulted in a crash with injury and 1 out of every 250,000 resulted in a crash involving loss of life, and an autopilot system was created that would reduce the number of accidents from 1:75000 to 1:300000 and the number of fatal accidents from 1:250000 to 1:1000000, wouldn‚Äôt that be a good thing? It would result in 3/4 crashes being avoided and 3/4 auto fatalities being avoided, which you would think would be good.

I don‚Äôt think America is ready yet culturally to accept that though. It makes perfect sense but people‚Äôs jimmies get rustled straight into orbit over this kind of thing. We readily accept when a driver makes an error and kills his passengers, as well as those of another vehicle, and call them tragic and terrible, but few would stop driving altogether or attempt to ban all drivers from traveling altogether due to the inherent safety risks. But when it‚Äôs an autonomous driving vehicle involved in an accident, in my opinion, most people are not able to digest that information and accept it as the inevitable reality of having self driving vehicles on the road alongside traditional automobiles is that there will be crashes and deaths. Hopefully as time progresses and more and more vehicles gain this technology and more drivers become familiar and competent with it, we will see a lot less horrific deaths in car crashes on our roadways every year."

It's been many years ago, but IIRC contact with the barrier and/or the subsequent steep angle caused the rear seat to unlatch and flap open, and during the airborne moments he went (head-first) over the top of the drivers seat and through the rear seat opening. Injured but survived. I don't recall the car model...possibly an early 1980s Honda Accord?"

2021-04-18 18:43:33,wallstreetbets,I'm not saying its easy to happen. I'm saying it's possible. And it makes more sense to me than going from 0 to 60 from driveway to end of street somehow driving from the backseat.

Put us all on autopilot for all I care and let it be controlled somehow."
2021-04-18 16:34:15,wallstreetbets,This would make any statistician cringe so hard. The sampling bias here is so offensive. It's not even attempting to argue/support the tech in good faith.

Even now the car can't exactly make you drive the steering wheel.. It keeps driving while the annoying alarm goes off. Once you do it enough times it will block you from using autopilot for a while."

2021-04-18 17:29:17,wallstreetbets,"Knowing that an asymmetric weight on the wheel tricks the hand sensor is common enough knowledge, I think. It's not even Tesla specific; it can work on other cars that don't have capacitive sensing for hands."

2021-04-18 17:24:10,wallstreetbets,"As an engineer I'll tell you that when it first seems like you're already there you're usually only 80% of the way there, and 80% of the time and effort is spent on that last 20%

If indeed it seems like you're about to crash ""frequently"" then there's a long way to go.

Let's be real here, they're making volunteers risk their health to train a neural network, which often requires thousands and thousands of iterations to get right."
2021-04-18 18:11:12,wallstreetbets,Reading this far in the comments I have deduced that wedging an orange in the steering wheel and (possibly) strapping a weight into the seatbelt seem like plausible bypasses for safety checks.

2021-04-18 19:19:06,wallstreetbets,"Theoretically they could have a minimum weight, say 35kg/77lbs. Now who wants to load that sort of weight in and out of a driver's seat?"
2021-04-18 19:22:09,wallstreetbets,That won't stop media from painting the blame on Tesla.

2021-04-18 17:24:13,wallstreetbets,"It's not called driverless. Find me one piece of official Tesla literature that refers to the autopilot product as driverless.

Just because the public names a concept inappropriately, doesn't mean it makes it that. I could call a woodchipper a sex doll. I can't sue PowerKing when I stick my dick in it."
2021-04-18 18:03:24,wallstreetbets,"This video is 3 years old at this point. To keep FSD engaged now, you have to actually give a nudge to the steering wheel, not just apply pressure."

2021-04-18 17:38:23,wallstreetbets,"Most cars nowadays have weight sensors on the seats (that are linked to seatbelt sirens), surely Teslas have the same feature incorporated into their cars??"

2021-04-18 18:13:27,wallstreetbets,">Let's be real here, they're making volunteers risk their health to train a neural network 

Worse, they're making volunteers risk the life and health of everyone around them who didn't volunteer but might get hit anyway.

I like Tesla overall but they are making a serious mistake by rolling out Autopilot like this."
2021-04-18 18:04:15,wallstreetbets,This guy in the video must have really good confidence in the autopilot haha. He's not even looking at the road.  He's looking at the dash and down.
2021-04-18 19:26:15,wallstreetbets,"People go out of their ways to bypass stuff like this all the time, there are other ways of bypassing sensors like a load cell such as a clamp or if you have no warranty, you can even do a simple circuit and hook up a bypass toggle switch."
2021-04-18 18:25:59,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't it also slow the car to a stop if the weight sensor on the driver seat disengages? I don't have a Tesla, but I thought that was the case"
2021-04-18 19:39:46,wallstreetbets,"This.  It's also why the FSD is basically worthless.  You have to jiggle the damn wheel every 30 seconds or it starts flipping out.  It's easier to just control the vehicle, takes less engagement than remembering to perform some unnatural movement on a straightaway.

&#x200B;

I used to take an old pipe clamp and tighten it around the wheel.  Not because my hands weren't on it, but because I don't iron grip steering wheels and it was constantly barking at me to grip it tighter.  Then they added the jiggle requirement and I was out."
2021-04-18 19:41:11,wallstreetbets,I mean you guys keep repeating this but it‚Äôs clear they still did it somehow. Unless the cops put the drivers body in the back seat because Texas loves oil
2021-04-18 19:51:29,wallstreetbets,"2 pound ankle weight is all you need, strap it to the 9pm position and it's as good as hands on the wheels as far as the car is concerned."
2021-04-18 17:46:53,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, those *should* disable autopilot / FSD betas nowadays (they didn't in the past), and are harder to bypass. But you *can* bypass them, and fuck you if you do.

The wheel bypass is somewhat legit IMO since torque sensing sucks balls and requires constant just-enough but not too much wiggling even with your hands on the wheel."
2021-04-18 17:45:12,wallstreetbets,Most vehicles only have it for occupants. It assumes the driver is in the seat since the vehicle had to be shifted out of park and into drive.

2021-04-18 17:51:43,wallstreetbets,That's the tricky part
2021-04-18 19:34:34,wallstreetbets,"True, I did that to my ride on mower. But it took effort to do that. The Tesla self driving fails are low effort and opportunistic in nature.

The other thing is, actually going to the effort of doing something like that shows a dedication to circumventing safety devices where as sticking an orange in the steering wheel is pure fucking laziness on the part of the manufacturer."
2021-04-18 19:37:40,wallstreetbets,"Geez, how hard is this.  A severed hobo hand packing-taped to the steering wheel and the limbless torso in the seat should do the trick. You don't even need the whole thing."

2021-04-18 17:52:32,wallstreetbets,"I agree. Anyone stupid enough to even want to be a passenger in their own car deserves smiting before they kill innocent people...

2021-04-18 19:55:38,wallstreetbets,My 2015 Honda will display a warning if a backpack like that is in the passenger seat as it assumes based on the weight it might be a kid and disables the air bags.  I would assume the Tesla would also require at least 70 lbs or so.

My negative thoughts are mainly regarding just trying to make sure I feel like I'm using my advantages to the fullest extent and that I'm just not floating through life.

No, unless investors are nuts, it won't impact shit since there's no liability for Tesla (thus nothing to discount from the SP) and headlines do mention that there was no driver. The autopilot (not even FSD) was designed as a driver-**assist** feature and Tesla explicitly tells you that you need an attentive driver on the driver's seat with both hands on the wheel. This is just your usual TSLA FUD pushed by the üåàüêª TSLAQ cult.

Do you blame automakers when a drunk driver dies in a car accident? It's worse because in this case those retards didn't even have a driver on the driver's seat."

18 ‚ÄúBring them here to me,‚Äù he said. 19 And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five tendies and the two quarters and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the tendies. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. 20 They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of tendies that were left over. 21 The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, besides women and children."

When it started to come up in like December iirc it started gaining a bit more attention around here, and everyone got in on the party when it actually got past like $20. Over a very short period of time, it went up to like 50, then 70, then 100, then it actually got to 420 lol. That's when the play ended, pretty much. However a bunch of newbies came in here and saw what was going on and also saw all the literal bs that was being posted to hype up the stock (I was pretty proud of a ""DD"" I posted that asserted that the stock had the potential to reach $36,000~). These newbies got in late, got stuck with bags, and never left. They tried to change the culture of the board into something that I would describe as antithetical to what it was before. 

I think a lot of people on wsb before then would love to work at a hedge fund, and in some ways admired the people that did. Now you have people making cringey comments about ""hedgepigs"" and misunderstanding the dynamics of the market at fundamental level but still getting upvotes because it confirms the newbie bias. The people who correct them get downvoted because of the same confirmation bias, and it leads to the board becoming a completely different vibe than it was before."

Also, they have far more brick and mortar retail exposure than PYPL and SQ which is why their growth slowed during Covid.  Curtail of live sporting event severely cut their sports betting revenue too.

An interesting comparison for brick and mortar payment processing would be Visa and Mastercard who, unlike Paysafe, both reported a severe contraction in revenue last year due to Covid.

\-- Visa: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%)

\-- Mastercard: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%)

The combined EV/EBITDA multiples of these two payment processors with negative revenue growth would put Paysafe‚Äôs share price at $25

2021-04-18 14:22:35,wallstreetbets,Thanks for your answer
2021-04-18 15:43:55,wallstreetbets,"But isn't the profit available to reinvest is the **net** profit (aka net income) though, not the gross? The net is what is left after paying for all costs incurred by the company (which you stated, so I'm not sure why you aren't using it). Using your mindset from the post of ""How many years to recoup the cost of buying the entire company"", the net profit is what you could put in your own pocket to make back your money.

Net income (or rather, net income per share) is also the metric used to calculate P/E ratio, which means that your value of 10.8 in the top post is incorrect. PSFE had a per share profit of -$1.01 for the most recent quarter, which means they have a P/E ratio of (price/share) / (income/share) = $13.59/-$1.01 = **-**13.5.

By the way, Paysafe has had increasingly negative net profits since 2018. However, a main driver of that appears to be depreciation of assets, impairments, etc. Revenue and EBIT (except for COVID) are increasing every year, so profits could well become positive soon enough as those negatives drop off the sheets.

For reference, here are [Paysafe's SEC filings](https://ir.paysafe.com/regulatory-filings/all-sec-filings). I used the financial statements from the most recent filing, which is Item 8 of form 20-F."

2021-04-18 18:24:52,wallstreetbets,"I don't think RBC is suddenly a $33.75 stock, but the volume also indicates something weird. There wasn't a single trade AH Thursday/PM Friday, Friday was a low volume day (which isn't crazy - it's a low volume stock), but then you get a 4:01/2pm dump, of like 30% of the total daily volume that indicates OTC trading being reported to the ticker then. It also jumps it by a dollar to an ATH. Then we see absolutely no trades until 4:29 when about 10k goes through at that price, then absolutely nothing until 5pm when a little goes through close to the original close, then at 5:14pm we have a decent sized chunk go through, and then finally 2 of that weird 448 block that's causing all the consternation paired weirdly with a 3 share trade at a normal price.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ry/after-hours-trades](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ry/after-hours-trades)

TD? No trades after 4:02 until a large block goes through at 5:07 then a final one at? You guessed it - 5:14 - [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/td/after-hours-trades](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/td/after-hours-trades)

BMO breaks the pattern a little, just has absolutely nothing past 4:02 - [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bmo/after-hours-trades](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bmo/after-hours-trades)

CIBC? back to it - very little past 4:02 (literally 6 shares, could easily be retail) until a huge block is traded at 5:07, then a final amount at? 5:14 [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/cm/after-hours-trades](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/cm/after-hours-trades)

Bell Canada tied in too, same pattern - huge amount reported at 4:00/01 as evidence of OTC block trades, a big sale at 5:07pm, a smaller sale at 5:14pm then nothing. [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bce/after-hours-trades](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bce/after-hours-trades)

Block trades on ToS - [https://imgur.com/gallery/V3o7bce](https://imgur.com/gallery/V3o7bce)

AH volume as a % of total volume - Fidelity, GS, MS, CS, Citi, WF, BoA, Deutsche all between 0.22%-5.42%

BMO - 24.14%  
BNS - 24.14%  
CM - 51.51%  
TD - 47.41%  
RY - around 25%

Now a lot of those trades are at 4:00/01 so they were probably OTC trades made during the day, but in CM/TD someone traded a ton at 5:07pm. And then everything goes radio silent after 5:14pm except for that weird 448 $33.75 ""glitch"" in RY. Meanwhile every American bank stock, CS, UBS, Barclays, Santander, etc keep having normal low volume trading up to 8pm. I don't think Canadian banks are going bankrupt or we'll be able to buy RY at $33.75 Monday, but is it possible someone who invested in all these got hit with a margin call & had positions liquidated Friday? Could it just be someone moving assets around?

Add ENB, BAM, TRP, CP, BCE, MFC, CNQ, SU to the list. Huge trades that either happen at 4:01 or were OTC block trades reported then, huge blocks sold at 4:44 or 5:07, someone closing out smaller positions at 5:14 & like no other AH activity.

tl;dr I don't think RBC is in trouble, but I'm pretty sure someone was liquidated (or at the least someone wanted to get the fuck out of a ton of positions real quick)."

What I believe happened is someone had a bunch of put options they exercised. Since they sold to someone in afterhours, the bid/ask spread likely got skewed where the bid placement was something like 30.00-500, 34.00-10, 34.25-1k ‚Äî‚Äî sell 95.00-100, 100.00-10, 115.00-20k. You will often see this happen with low volume mid and low cap stocks. I have made comments before about how aftermarket options exercising is a game that destroys lives and the reason I don‚Äôt trade spreads(as well as early exercise risk). It is literally about tricking people and their algos into selling a position based on bid/ask spread and when the stocks are dumped in order to take advantage of a lack of bid/ask spreads. Imagine making 20k in a weekend, now imagine doing it on a daily basis because you have the computers and the money to monitor everything(think market makers).

So at the beginning of the covid crises, the Federal Reserve temporarily changed some of the rules for Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) to incentivize banks to continue to lend in an uncertain economy. This allowed the banks to take on a *bit* more risk in order to keep the economy afloat. 

This rule change expired last month and given that we are in a frothy bull market, you can imagine JPM‚Äôs asset ratio has changed quite a bit in the last year. Selling bonds is a good way to balance TLAC requirements, particularly when interest rates are the lowest they‚Äôve been in a very long time."

The answers is Canada's big banks have an oligopoly and because of this competition is severely limited. 
They take advantage of this and take advantage of Canadians. 
Almost all.CDN banks have invested heavily outside of Canada to great effect. TD Ameritrade doesn't charge cimmission but the CDN version does.

Wealth Simple, apart from being bare bones, still makes money on the spread so you will pay more for your trade it just won‚Äôt be in fees, and they also charge extra money on exchange fees. In addition, Wealth Simple is not a money maker, it‚Äôs a loss leader. Meaning they are purposefully losing money to gain client share before starting to charge, which you can expect some sort of fee structure in the near future. It‚Äôs business 101 hombre.

2021-04-18 14:21:53,wallstreetbets,"There is truth in this comment response but also misinformation.

A little over a year ago, $CLF produced zero steel as they were only a mining company. The vast majority of ""dilution"" being mentioned is primarily from acquiring $AKS and $MT's USA assets over the last year to become the largest HRC steel producer in North America. This occurs with most acquisitions... for example, $AKS shareholders would be pissed if they didn't get $CLF shares when they were acquired.

Thus comparisons against historic pricing for $CLF by itself are indeed very flawed. One would need to include $AKS and the portion of $MT's USA assets as part of any historical analysis. But ""dilution"" by itself isn't an answer as the company is now three companies in one. This is why $CLF's revenue is expected to be 1,000% higher this year than the previous year.

At present, $CLF's [guidance](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Cleveland-Cliffs+%28CLF%29+sees+Q1+2021+adjusted+EBITDA+of+approximately+%24500+million/18197647.html) for the year has the company earning EBITDA profit of 40% of its current market cap this year alone. What kind of valuation one wants to give the company is indeed up for debate. Note that guidance is based on 2021 HRC pricing average of $975 and future contracts currently have that average at around \~$1250.

For a chart on how the HRC steel production landscape has changed in the USA, [see this image](https://stocktwits.com/saycheese/message/306429904)."
2021-04-18 15:02:30,wallstreetbets,"Yeah if OP thinks the company is going to hit all time high valuation then that would mean a market cap of just under 15 billion. It currently has a market cap of 9 billion at 18 dollars per share. That would mean a peak share price of 28 dollars. 

I've got clf shares at 13.80 average cost .. may look to add some more"
2021-04-18 13:18:48,wallstreetbets,"I'm looking more at their recent acquisitions of MT usa. 
And also the ""share dilution"" you speak of was a vote to issue the RIGHT to issue those shares. They did not actually dilute the shares.

2021-04-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I analyzed all 700+ buy and sell recommendations made by Jim Cramer in 2021. Here are the results. **Preamble:** Jim Cramer is definitely a controversial figure. While argument can be made on whether he is on the side of retail investors or not, what I really wanted to know was how his stock picks are performing. Surprisingly, there were no trackers for the performance of Cramer‚Äôs pick in his program (his program is Mad Money, for those who are not familiar). 

**Where the data is from:** [here](https://madmoney.thestreet.com/screener/index.cfm). All the 19,201 stock picks made by Cramer are listed here. His stock picks are updated here daily. While Cramer mentions a lot of stocks in his program, I only considered the stocks that Cramer specifically recommended that you should buy or sell. (I have ignored the stocks where Cramer says he likes/dislikes the stock since I felt that it‚Äôs a vague statement and cannot be considered as a buy/sell recommendation). 

**Analysis:** There were 725 buy/sell recommendations made by Cramer in 2021. Out of this, 651 were Buy and 74 were Sell. For both sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods. 

a. One Day

b. One Week 

c. One Month

d. Price Change till date 

I also checked what percentage of Cramer‚Äôs calls were right across different time periods. 

**Results:**

 Cramer made a total of 651 buy recommendations over the course of the past 4 months. If you had invested in every single stock, he recommended and then pulled out the next day, the returns were a staggering 555%. He was also right on 58.9% of the calls he made (Benchmark being 50% since anyone can pick a random stock and the probability of the stock going up is 50%). The weekly performance returns are also a respectable 42% but he was barely touching 50% in the percentage of right picks. One month from his recommendations, the stock return is an abysmal -223% and he was wrong more than he was right on his calls. The returns till date are also phenomenal with 446% return and Cramer being right a whopping 63.6% in his stock picks.

Cramer‚Äôs sell recommendations performed better than his buy recommendations across different time periods. This stat is particularly commendable since we were in a predominantly bull market across the last 4 months. 57.5% of the stocks he recommended as a sell dropped in price the next day with a cumulative return of -118.9%. This trend is observed across the time period with returns for the sell recommendations being negative. The only statistic that is working against Cramer‚Äôs sell recommendation is the percentage of right picks till date being only 42%. But still the cumulative return for all the stocks was -206%. Please note that Cramer made only 74 sell recommendations against a whopping 651 buy recommendations during the same period of time. 

**Limitations of the analysis**

The above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, Cramer has made a total of 19K recommendations in his program. I have only analyzed his 2021 recommendations. The site which provides the data is extremely limited in terms of how we can access the data. Also, currently the data is pulled from street.com which was earlier owned by Cramer. They update the data everyday after the show, but I could not verify if they go back and change the calls down the line (very unlikely with it being a large business). Also, for the return calculations, I have only used the closing price of the stock across the time periods. The returns can theoretically be higher if you consider the intra-day highs and lows. 

**Conclusion** 

No matter how we feel about Cramer, the one-day returns on both his buy and sell recommendations have been phenomenal. I started the analysis thinking that the returns would be mediocre at best as there were no trackers actively tracking the returns from his calls. But the data points otherwise. It seems that there is a lot of scope for short term plays based on Cramer‚Äôs recommendation. Let me know what you think!

2021-04-18 16:31:38,wallstreetbets,"OP: I've fixed your spreadsheet comparing Jim Cramer to the market. In a massive bull market like the one we're in, it's insanely easy to pick stonks that go up. Because to some degree, all stocks move with the market.

Instead of using gains as an indicator, you should be using the general market (Any S&P 500 index works, I used SPY, but easy to change if you have another preference).

It is interesting in the short term (1-day) Cramer beats the market. But this is likely a self-fulfilling prophecy as people buy what he recommends, driving the price up.

I also replaced your ""cumulative % gains"" with a median. Since Cumulative gains don't mean shit. If I buy 3 stocks, and they all go up 10%, I made 10%, not 30%. However Median (or middle point), takes the middle performing stock. So you know 50% of stocks did better than that number, while 50% did worst.

Therefore, the dude is mediocre for short term plays, and sub par for <30. Someone else said 30 dte puts on all of Cramer's picks, and that sounds about right. Long term plays? Sure? It's hard to recommend that, especially when SPY and QQQ are extremely hot."
2021-04-18 18:46:24,wallstreetbets,"Hi there! Love the analysis. My main concern with the 1-day return is that the ""price at recommendation"" is the closing price a couple hours before the show actually airs. So the 1-day returns might be much less because a trader probably can't actually purchase at the price listed. For instance, looking at BAC (recommended April 15th 2021), the 1 day change is listed as 1.06%. If I'm understanding correctly, this is calculated as 100\*(39.15-38.74)/38.74 (because April 16th market close was $39.15, and April 15th market close was $38.74).

But the show actually happens after market close (6pm eastern time). Looking in Yahoo Finance, I see that there was a spike in after-hours price for BAC, during the time period that mad money airs:  


April 15th, 6:25pm - $38.82

April 15th, 6:50pm - $39.03

&#x200B;

To be fair, this is a period of 25 minutes, so maybe traders with after-hours-trading enabled would be able to lock in a decent price somewhere within this time span (I'm not sure if the recommendation was made closer to 6:25pm or 6:50pm). But if the 6:50pm price is representative of the price a trader could get after the stock is recommended on the show, the 1.06% 1-day return goes down to 0.3% (100\*(39.15-39.03)/39.03).

&#x200B;

Of course, this is just one example, but this could be a big drag on the shorter timespans (like 1-day). This probably wouldn't affect the longer timespans much though."

Cramer's Mad Money airs at 6:00 EDT when I assume he made his buy recommendation. Next day 4-16 it opened at 338.90. It would not have been possible to buy at Cramer's price on the 16 th at the open."

2021-04-18 12:20:58,wallstreetbets,Feel bad about this post. You should.
2021-04-18 12:23:53,wallstreetbets,Cramer is üí© who else agree?

You buy little box.

You open little box.

Nothing inside little box."
2021-04-18 12:25:39,wallstreetbets,"It looks a lot like pump and dump... I mean, when he says ""buy"" he doesn't say ""buy for one day"" ... 

It could also be not intended, or the Cramer effect, but I guess that's it. Also, as pointed out in other comments, if he does his predictions at evening so the orders can only be done AH or PM, it means that most of the trades are only available to ""certain"" actors. 

It would be Indeed interesting to check the comparison of the first day based on opening price Vs closing price, to check whether that 500+% is really ""real"" for the retail traders too"
2021-04-18 12:26:13,wallstreetbets,Cramer recommends after hours so next day performance is not the best way. He can recommend buy/sell based on AH performance or earnings results. The next day performance should be close/open not previous close.
2021-04-18 12:34:41,wallstreetbets,"He was yellin at Adam Aron to sell 100-200 million shares, like 2 weeks later Adam Aron said he doesnt need to sell much shares now. At max 40m gets him through this year and the 500 million share dilution that Jimmy tried to push on viewers was all FUD created by Jimmy. Dont like Jim, blatantly tried to influence AMC and GME aswell as TSLA."
2021-04-18 12:35:08,wallstreetbets,What you are describing is pump and dump.
2021-04-18 12:38:46,wallstreetbets,"Is there any way to remove or somehow address recommendations that have been contradictory?  For instance, having PLUG and SPWR on the show and recommending Buy, and within a month saying both are bad."

2021-04-18 12:59:29,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt know diddly, but seeing how he talked about his ‚Äúhedge fund‚Äù days is enough for me to recognize this guy is bad news to the little guys."
2021-04-18 13:00:44,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn‚Äôt you agree that in a bull market it‚Äôs probably a 60/40 that the stock goes up though, rather than a 50/50?"
2021-04-18 13:01:19,wallstreetbets,You literally just proved Crammer only does pump and dumps. Thank you.
2021-04-18 13:03:46,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs almost like he‚Äôs being told which stocks to pick. Crazy.

2021-04-18 13:06:33,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll have to study this but it sounds like he pumps the stock initially for shorters. Price goes up,
Shorters move in, price goes down"
2021-04-18 13:06:59,wallstreetbets,"All of Cramer‚Äôs buy recommendations are 3-4 months behind the market.

He‚Äôs very consistent actually. Every thesis he pushes is 110% priced in. Just in time for a pullback."
2021-04-18 13:10:28,wallstreetbets,How is his portfolio looking. I mean he must be making millions if he can drop/raise prices of stocks for the next day.
2021-04-18 13:11:43,wallstreetbets,No shit the one day returns skyrocket the demand outweighs the supply hence price sky rockets
2021-04-18 13:12:06,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer waves goodbye to his pee when he flushes the toilet.

2021-04-18 13:17:36,wallstreetbets,"When you say cumulative return, do you mean you added all the percentage up?  Like, if I invested the same amout in all 651 buy recommendations I would make 0.847% in gains, or are you saying if I invested the same amount in all 651 recommendations I would make 552%.

One is so impressive it's impossible to believe, the other is believable, and not terribly impressive.

Edit: I see from the spreadsheet you summed the percentages. Percentages don't work that way."
2021-04-18 13:25:51,wallstreetbets,"I am curious to see what the return would be if you constrained the study to small cap stocks, as he would presumably have more influence over the direction of a stock in this case. I would expect to see higher highs and lower lows, which could be an interesting play. 

Since his program runs AH, it could be a play to buy one month puts following his buy recommendations, and perhaps the returns could be greater if you only considered smaller cap stocks."
2021-04-18 13:26:05,wallstreetbets,Gonna stick to buying the index then.
2021-04-18 13:31:20,wallstreetbets,How the crap does something go down 223% in a month.  Is it negative or something?
2021-04-18 13:32:37,wallstreetbets,"It would be nice to run the same analysis month, by month, against the DJIA or SP500."

Unless you are able to trade after hours then I assume you would try to buy open and sell before close of that day?"
2021-04-18 13:41:36,wallstreetbets,CNBC is pure scum - every analyst is guilty of market manipulation.
2021-04-18 13:46:11,wallstreetbets,"I strongly disagree with the part where you state picking the right stock 50% of the time is the benchmark. Yes, you have two possible outcomes, up or down. No, that does not mean 50% chance of guessing the correct outcome.

If you guess a stock will go up while 70% of the market is doing well, your odds were above 50%. If you pick a stock to go up while the rest of the market is crashing, your odds were below 50%."
2021-04-18 13:50:26,wallstreetbets,"I honestly think Jim Cramer is great. I don‚Äôt follow his advice, but he has rational for the stocks that he brings up. He changes his mind, like all of us, but I think Mad Money is a fun show and his opinion is based in reality, rather than YouTube investors who say SNDL is going to 20$! Based on no fundamentals lol"
2021-04-18 13:52:07,wallstreetbets,"Very fun post to read, thank you."
2021-04-18 13:57:18,wallstreetbets,"It is probably the same as what happens with Elon, Elon speaks and the people listen. He has directly impacted prices with a harmless tweet more than once.

Cramer is so mainstream that he speaks and people buy/sell accordingly which impacts the price. Almost a self fulfilling prophesy. Does that have any probability?"
2021-04-18 13:58:13,wallstreetbets,Did you at the initial signals price before or after he made his statement?
2021-04-18 14:00:32,wallstreetbets,"Either 

a) when he talks, people listen and they buy. 

b) he knows what the hedge funds are buying up before the market opens or the previous day.

2021-04-18 14:07:47,wallstreetbets,"Why are you looking at the summed return? Needs to be an average.

What does it look like vs the index?"
2021-04-18 14:08:14,wallstreetbets,Half a year when everything is threw the roof? My 5 year old could predict it when people are telling him what they want. Look at whole career and in the biggest moment of his career when he knew about the situation looked right in the camera and said don‚Äôt take out of Bears S. Lost any respect for him after that.

2021-04-18 14:10:12,wallstreetbets,Cramer aka the biggest hedgie pump and dump scammo in history
2021-04-18 14:11:17,wallstreetbets,Cant manipulate a market if he kept ‚Äúguessing‚Äù wrong
2021-04-18 14:15:34,wallstreetbets,But wouldn‚Äôt merely having a public platform and telling people to do something make them do it and make you correct? Everyone Sell the price is going down! Ok! We sold! The price goes down. So being public is the only reason he was ever accurate.
2021-04-18 14:17:01,wallstreetbets,"The data to me just confirms that he's setting up pump and dumps. A lot of people are watching him and listening to him, so if he makes a stock pick, a lot of people will Fomo in or panic sell the next day which has that effect on the stock price. Then hedgies are dumping within a week and after hedgies are done dumping, retailers start dumping as well."
2021-04-18 14:20:23,wallstreetbets,Any chance you could do this analysis where it starts 1-2 days from the recommendation so we could see post Cramer P&D?
2021-04-18 14:23:04,wallstreetbets,"How much of that one-day rise do you think was due to him pumping the stock on his show?

Does that pattern sound like this?

**Day:** Excitement Buy

**Week:** Paper Hands 

**Month:** Buyer's Remorse

**Til:** Second Wave Climb (Buying the Dip)"
2021-04-18 14:23:38,wallstreetbets,"Cramer is the king of the pump and subsequent dump. Not surprising. He picks solid companies most of the time and we‚Äôre in a bull market, that should be skewing the metrics"
2021-04-18 14:24:28,wallstreetbets,I really liked his book
2021-04-18 14:27:36,wallstreetbets,"What I‚Äôm getting from this is , if you can‚Äôt time the one day buy suggestion , wait one month to buy and you should get decent returns in another month or 2"
2021-04-18 14:33:37,wallstreetbets,Imagine making money in a bull market. Crazy shit.
2021-04-18 14:37:05,wallstreetbets,"Shouldn't the benchmark for ""% right picks"" be above 50%? We've been in an insane Bull market for a while now, anyone can guess a fortune 500 company and have a pretty good chance of making money. 

500%+ daily returns is pretty insane but that's just Cramer pumping and dumping boomers.

If you asked me he's doing just as good as anyone on his longs and that's because wallstreet is a casino and he isn't the house as much as any of us."
2021-04-18 14:37:41,wallstreetbets,I would recommend looking at REGI. THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE TERRIFIC.  THIS IS 4x stock.
2021-04-18 14:38:27,wallstreetbets,He's gonna fucking love this post won't he. Of course the things he pick goes up the day after. Bullshit that this isn't considered market manipulation but DFV gets into problems. Also Cramer can easily be bought by the HFs. Duck this guy.
2021-04-18 14:40:00,wallstreetbets,"Cranmer is the original pump and dump pusher.

All stocks successful are memes."
2021-04-18 14:40:13,wallstreetbets,"Great analysis but what the fuck is ""till date""?!  That's not even a thing."
2021-04-18 14:42:38,wallstreetbets,Slightly false premise to say the baseline is 50% chance of going up when picked at random since we are in a 12 year bull
2021-04-18 14:43:30,wallstreetbets,"Random walk theory does not apply to S&P 500 data on any time scale.

You will get bias to increasing numbers at about the 7% annualized rate.

If you don't care about that rate, or you compensate for it, it applies, but otherwise, it doesn't follow random walk. The next day is not a 50/50."
2021-04-18 14:46:50,wallstreetbets,This just seems like pump and dump. One day returns mean nothing.
2021-04-18 14:46:57,wallstreetbets,Only way to go lambo is to Hold
2021-04-18 14:48:07,wallstreetbets,"This one-day return is kinda pointless since it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. Enough people listen to what he says and buys to move the market, even if by a small amount.

Instead of doing the average return, you should do the median return. Since unless you listen to everything he recommends and buys it all, you won't get the average return. But the median return gives you a better idea if you buy a random pick he made.

The fact he's made +700 calls this year and we're in a bull market (an amazingly bull market), doesn't really surprise me that it's up. Really you should compare his picks to the S&P500. It's easy to make money, but it's not so easy to beat the market. Also, it's hard to see if the trends hold."
2021-04-18 14:48:11,wallstreetbets,"Why are you showing cumulative returns (I assume the sum of all stock movements), rather than an average effect over the time period."
2021-04-18 14:51:23,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt hate the guy, but one thing I never liked about Cramer was how big of a hypocrite he can be when he talks about certain stocks. He can loath them, caress them, talk about how golden they are. Then give it a week and he trashes on them and kicks them to them to the curb"
2021-04-18 14:51:30,wallstreetbets,"He's on his side, seems to me day traders and fund analysts stand to benefit the most from his performance."
2021-04-18 14:52:10,wallstreetbets,"I feel like 2020 was such an insane year for stocks across all spectrums, so I can‚Äôt really buy too much into this. I would love to see more years though"
2021-04-18 14:53:20,wallstreetbets,There is no way to tell if the movement would have been the same without his recommendation.
2021-04-18 14:54:04,wallstreetbets,This does sort of read as a Cramer recommendation on it's own is market manipulation.  Especially since they are only good investments for the day he recommended them.
2021-04-18 14:55:12,wallstreetbets,"This actually made me want to start listening to Cramer, with all the doubts from everyone, I haven‚Äôt. But I don‚Äôt have much money right now, and I‚Äôm not a complete moron, so you don‚Äôt gotta worry about me buying his recommendations. I don‚Äôt have regular cable, how do I watch his show?"
2021-04-18 15:02:42,wallstreetbets,"It doesn‚Äôt surprise me that these are the results given the following that Cramer has.  However, I would opine that he already has a position in everything he recommends on his show, probably closing that position the next morning in pre-market during the buying frenzy as his followers all jump in."
2021-04-18 15:03:16,wallstreetbets,"Great DD. Conclusion: Cramer creates more bag holders than anyone else.

Intentionally or not, one thing is for sure: if anyone else had a record like that they wouldn't be on TV for very long. Some HF must have their hand up his rear end that makes him squawk when they need to liquidate."
2021-04-18 15:07:43,wallstreetbets,">Benchmark being 50% since anyone can pick a random stock and the probability of the stock going up is 50%

lol.  No.  Most stocks go up.  Especially the types of companies that Cramer recommends.  Its not 50/50.  The benchmark is typically the S&P500.  That is what you need to beat in order to be ""successful"".

Otherwise, what this says is that Cramer is a hype machine.  The dude mentions a stock on his show and it skyrockets the next day."
2021-04-18 15:09:11,wallstreetbets,The fact that these picks go red after a.month only proves that Cramer is good at pumping and dumping stocks.
2021-04-18 15:10:09,wallstreetbets,"I remember tracking his recommendations years ago to see how they did a couple of months later and concluded that I might as well flip a coin.

Anyone with a big following can make stocks they recommend go up almost immediately, why do you think ARK shows their daily trades? They say it's to be transparent. I say it's to pump those stocks.

Even random traders on Twitter can pump certain stocks just by mentioning it if they have a big enough following.  

Also keep in mind that over the past few months, the market has been sky rocketing, even crap penny stocks have gone insane.

He gives out so many recommendations that it's basically like those trading gurus. Recommend a bunch of stocks and brag about the ones that actually go up and never talk about the ones that went down."
2021-04-18 15:10:56,wallstreetbets,"Yes, this is called a pump and dump."
2021-04-18 15:12:16,wallstreetbets,Cramers ugly wife doodled this obviously
2021-04-18 15:14:34,wallstreetbets,Where do people follow his recommendations?   Twitter?   I find his videos too annoying you watch is there a summary somewhere of daily recommendations?
2021-04-18 15:14:53,wallstreetbets,Found Cramer‚Äôs burner account
2021-04-18 15:15:01,wallstreetbets,"Millions of viewers react to what he‚Äôs says.  That‚Äôs not the same as being a good stock forecaster. Besides that, I despise the corporate media. I don‚Äôt even watch tv anymore."

2021-04-18 15:23:21,wallstreetbets,"Well well well, look who's an expert at paperhanding. Figures."
2021-04-18 15:23:35,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs easy to influence the price of a stock when you have a large audience of people trading on your recommendation. The better analysis would be to compare his buy/sell recommendations to the trading activity of his charitable trust that he is always talking about. If he recommended something as a buy and it shot up 500% the next day was his trust selling at a huge profit? Also if he recommended something as a sell and it dumped 80% the next day was he then swooping in and buying cheap?
2021-04-18 15:24:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeahhhhh I have always wondered how his show is not seen as illegal since it 100% influences investing patterns. People call in and say ""I bought this because you said to"" etc. But somehow talking about stocks on reddit was cause for a hearing?"

2021-04-18 15:29:39,wallstreetbets,Nice analysis! What the hell is ‚ÄúTill Date‚Äù though? Hold until a specific date??
2021-04-18 15:31:19,wallstreetbets,The benchmark isn‚Äôt 50% in a bull market stocks will go up more often than down. To create an actual benchmark you need to look at what the entire market did in that period did 50% of the stocks go up or 75% of them? If it‚Äôs greater than Cramers percentage of right picks then he may have made money but he is still a donut who just got lucky
2021-04-18 15:31:48,wallstreetbets,that to me sounds like market manipulation
2021-04-18 15:33:11,wallstreetbets,The one way this is flawed is we are in a massive bull market. If a literal ape threw shit at a chart he would probably have similar results
2021-04-18 15:42:59,wallstreetbets,This analysis doesn't say anything. One day returns in any random selectoon in a bull market woild have gone up. The 4 month returns again mean nothing in a bull market because all stocks have gone up. What is the alpha of his selectoon ie excess return over bench mark?
2021-04-18 15:44:52,wallstreetbets,Anybody trying to glean a trend from the last year bull market doesn‚Äôt really understand statistics.
2021-04-18 15:45:15,wallstreetbets,"So I understand your analysis, are you measuring buying it the day of his show, and then selling it the next day?"
2021-04-18 15:46:56,wallstreetbets,All this is just noise.  You have to really search and try to find solid stock at a discount.  In the end I feel like I‚Äôm just gambling my money.

2021-04-18 15:56:21,wallstreetbets,What this really shows is that he‚Äôs a pump and dumper
2021-04-18 15:58:14,wallstreetbets,He's right in the short term because people buy on his recommendations.
2021-04-18 16:02:35,wallstreetbets,"under your limitations, you should have also said that the market is impacted by his recommendations."
2021-04-18 16:08:18,wallstreetbets,"I mean yeah his one day returns are like a pump n dump, but returns till date of 446% are still pretty nice, isnt it?"
2021-04-18 16:09:10,wallstreetbets,How exactly does one have less than -100% returns on a buy recommendation?
2021-04-18 16:09:27,wallstreetbets,Was Bear Stearns on the list? Cant seem to find it.
2021-04-18 16:11:26,wallstreetbets,One day returns=self fulfilling prophecy
2021-04-18 16:13:11,wallstreetbets,Thanks for all the work. But FUCK CRAMER. If that fool was on fire i wouldnt pee on him to help him. That POS is one of them. He wont help us hes there to talk shit about stocks the HFs are shorting.
2021-04-18 16:13:38,wallstreetbets,"His long terms buys have gone up
His long term sales have gone down.

On the large sample size This clearly just shows the markets been gradually going up in general rather than any clever picks"
2021-04-18 16:20:18,wallstreetbets,Ok so his calls last one day. So that means buy JMIA Monday. He said he didn‚Äôt like it and you should dump it on Friday. It dropped $2. Calls on Monday morning will print based on this analysis.
2021-04-18 16:23:32,wallstreetbets,"\>No matter how we feel about Cramer, the one-day returns on both his buy and sell recommendations have been phenomenal.

a big part of it has to be the fact that he says it on air, and people react to it."

You recommend, audience buy, price goes up.


To really test something like this you would have to have predictions in a vacuum/unknown without influence.


Basically we should all watch Jim Cramer every day, speedclick the buybutton on recommendations and sell at a profit predetermined. 


Sounds like a plan? %)"

2021-04-18 16:35:49,wallstreetbets,"Why would you assume that there's a 50/50 chance a stock goes up or down? Historically, stocks are much more likely to increase 

Also the fact that his one day returns are orders of magnitude better than his one month returns shows that either these stocks were already strongly trending in that direction leading to his call, or his recommendation leads to a stock being pumped/dumped, but it corrects itself

It actually seems like the best strategy is waiting a couple days and then doing the opposite of what he suggests"
2021-04-18 16:36:48,wallstreetbets,"So, he is basically great but generates pump and dumps by himself?"
2021-04-18 16:37:48,wallstreetbets,"Boomers and almost boomers listen to cramer religiously. Obviously next day results reflect that. Try doing the same thing for the first year his show aired, when he wasn't popular yet."
2021-04-18 16:40:47,wallstreetbets,I don't watch Cramer and therefore don't heed his advise but wasn't he accused of pumping up some stocks so he made money on them a few years back. He has no credibility with me.
2021-04-18 16:45:29,wallstreetbets,"So buy that day, sell the next, and use the profits to short for 1 mo, then buy again?"

2021-04-18 16:50:49,wallstreetbets,"Interesting. 

Question? Given the average return is 0.9% would the commission and more importantly the spread negate a lot of the 500% plus gain given the small average gain?"
2021-04-18 16:51:49,wallstreetbets,"I'm missing something here: how can the return be -223%? Even if his picks went to 0, wouldn't the return be at worst -100%? Or are you adding up the returns from all picks?"
2021-04-18 16:57:51,wallstreetbets,Your analysis assumes you can buy at the closing price the day BEFORE he recommended it which makes your analysts basically retarded.

2021-04-18 17:50:39,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for putting this together. A very important correction that needs to be made is that the 1-day return is not 555%, but rather 0.90%, as per your spreadsheet. This is how much people would have made if they bought in all recommendations at close price (which is not possible). The best strategy is most certainly to short all the stocks at the next closing for the -0.51% in a month (not -223%). It doesn't seem that interesting tbh."

Because he is telling you to buy stocks which his institutional buddies bought sometime ago. And would be selling soon.

2021-04-18 18:07:39,wallstreetbets,"Not sure anyone has mentioned this yet, but the ""cumulative return"" calculation appears to be wrong  u/nobjos. The time period of investing in each stock overlaps with the other stocks that were mentioned that day (they are parallel investments), but the cumulative return calculation assumes that they are serial investments on different days. Thanks for the analysis though, the 24hr turnaround would still make a ton of money, just not 500% in 3.5 months...more like around 80% (just take the number of days the market has been open this year and multiply by 0.9%)."

2021-04-18 18:22:25,wallstreetbets,I pretty much do the opposite every time he says something.  He often changes what he previously said before.  He was telling people to buy amazon after there last earnings when it was in the 3400‚Äôs those people are still down.  He was telling people DOCU was a post Covid winner at the end of 2020 and now he said it‚Äôs too hot when it was hotter before on a buy.  His 500 ticker and above club tanked hard immediately.  He was recommending SNOW at 300 but says it needs to come down now.  The thing that drives me nuts is that he switches around what he says all the time. He hates PLTR but has loved CRM and SNOW.  Think about all the high flying spacs he reccommended and now is basically against all spacs. NGA XL RMO CCIV.

Or, to put it differently, his pump&dump schemes work phenomenal. How do you distinguish panic sales _caused_ by his recommendations from what the stock would have done without his recommendation for example? This is not science."
2021-04-18 18:27:54,wallstreetbets,"So is this based on the price right before the show or the close price the day before.  And again the one day price at what point are you taking the price, one day after the show or the price point at opening next day?"

This of course simply means that he and his group front run and the gullible (lazy/sheep whatever you want to call it) viewers that buy  the ""I don't want to make friends I want to make YOU money stick.""  All that legal disclaimer stuff at the bottom of the screen, you know.

Disclaimer:  I haven't watched Ol  Jimbo  in years but a quick Google search of all the talking heads on CNBC can be quite the eye opener if you've never taken the time to do it you should.

Edit:  BTW Cramer isn't the first, he is just the latest in a long line of financial hucksters.  Google some old school classics like Dan Dorfman from USA today or R Foster Winans from the Wall Street Journal. Maria Bartiromo (the money honey) was married to Johnathon Steinberg, son of Saul Steinberg.  Yes THAT Saul Steinberg.   Saul was a bigtime ""greenmail"" corporate raider in the 80's.  Herb Greenberg used to work for a bigtime ""short"" boutique.  It goes on and on."

2021-04-18 18:42:15,wallstreetbets,Majority of his recommendations are BUY and we are in an insane bull market that lasted a decade. Not really a fair benchmark to compare it to a 50/50 coin toss.
2021-04-18 18:45:38,wallstreetbets,"‚Äú(Benchmark being 50% since anyone can pick a random stock and the probability of the stock going up is 50%).‚Äù

Gotta disagree with you there. Just because it can go up or down doesn‚Äôt mean the odds are an even 50%. Earnings reports, bankruptcy announcements, media hype, all could greatly influence one way or the other.

Besides, you forgot the stock could go sideways. So if we‚Äôre talking solely about direction odds, would it not have to be 1/3 1/3 1/3?"
2021-04-18 18:45:46,wallstreetbets,"I think this article (and the game theory concept of common knowledge) - https://www.epsilontheory.com/sheep-logic/

2021-04-18 19:41:56,wallstreetbets,"you have to provide some control to this analysis, like comparing the data against the overall performance of the market sector he's making guesses about, and what the stock was doing the moment he made the call, and since the 24 hour period is what you're looking at primarily, the 24 hour period before he made his call. my guess is he's picking stocks towards the end of an upswing in both 1. their market sector and 2. the stock itself. Like, it's pretty easy to pick a pharma company that just beat earnings during a market-wide pharma run. the issue is, as others here are pointing out, is when to time an exit on his pump-and-dumpedness."
2021-04-18 19:42:21,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer wears compression socks on his head.
2021-04-18 19:43:35,wallstreetbets,"This is awesome.  A few questions:

1.  What is ""till date""?  Is that just the returns until now?  What if he recommends a buy and a few months later recommends a sell?

2.  I assume that all the returns are annualized?

3.  Since his show comes on after the regular market close, 
but before the AH session.. what price do you assume that the stocks were bought/sold at?  The closing price on the day of his show seems unreasonable (because that's no longer available).  A more reasonable price might be the next trading day's open (which anyone can get with a MOO order), although then you might miss the P&D gains.  Buying AH is possible although poor liquidity makes it hard to figure out what price someone would have gotten.

4.  Do you ignore picks where he says to buy if you can get in under a certain price (I think he did that for Snowflake when they came public) or where he says to buy ""only if it comes down""?

This is seriously great analysis; thanks for doing it."

Now ask yourself how this would work for someone new? Those losses are someone paper handing in a month. Because they didn‚Äôt sell the next day, or they thought a longer hold wasn‚Äôt going to profit.

2021-04-18 15:56:01,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the analysis, but I would love a longer term view. I been around to know how Cramer works and without any stats, I am confident you would have lost more money than you made if you followed his recommendations. His one day returns are because people dive in (or out) the moment he makes a recommendation.  That is why I find that one month performance interesting because it means that by then, folks get out from the hype and actually lose money. Also, Cramer has ‚Äúwinners‚Äù by recommending the obvious. Yeah, Tesla, Amazon, Apple etc. when they been going on an uptrend. Where was he when GME was at $3. What was he saying when the market was crashing last year? Did he say to buy before or much after the market bottomed out. Heck, he should credit WSB since many of his good recommendations are coming from you beautiful people, but he fails to give that credit. 

TL;DR: Cramer sucks. You get better DD and advice in WSB or by yourself."
2021-04-18 16:41:11,wallstreetbets,How is this even legal and still on air?
2021-04-18 17:38:54,wallstreetbets,"That was my thoughts exactly. Surely a lot of people watch the show, so his recommendations, if followed by enough people, may end up increasing or decreasing the stock. 

Which could trigger people who don't watch, but see the trendlines, to make choices too. 

So yea, a sort of pump and dump ad lol."
2021-04-18 19:13:22,wallstreetbets,How is this not stock manipulation?
2021-04-18 18:33:34,wallstreetbets,Correct. He is a scumbag. Hedge funds love him on the sell position. Anyone buying a stock because of Kramer should drink bleach and donate their money.

2021-04-18 11:49:43,wallstreetbets,I think the difference is that Cramer is an on air financial advisor supported by a massive company; DFV is not. I agree with the part that DFV shouldn‚Äôt be sued though.

2021-04-18 18:59:02,wallstreetbets,"The method is poor, but you are also wrong. Stocks aren't down by over 100%, cumulative gain percentages are. If you buy 10 sideways stocks, you have 0% gain. If each goes down by 50%, you've lost 50% of your total investment but the cumulative negative gain percentage is 500%. If one goes up 50% and the rest go down 50%, it's - 450%.

 It's definitely a weird way to measure it, but it also makes sense since each stock won't have the same price. 1% of 100 is a lot more than 1% of 1. So it would be a lot different if that was measured. 10% ROI on a $1 stock is not the same as 10% ROI on a $100 stock. Basically, you can't meaningfully add percentages like OP does and convert it to ROI."

2021-04-18 11:45:06,wallstreetbets,"Actually for short term like a day, any random stock IS 50/50 up or down FOR THE DAY. 
I don‚Äôt care how educated your guess is.
Just like a football game, any given Sunday.

And I think it‚Äôs a version of the ‚Äúobserver effect‚Äù that gives Cramer his short term edge."
2021-04-18 11:40:19,wallstreetbets,He just needs more cocaine
2021-04-18 16:40:36,wallstreetbets,"This is a really misleading analysis actually.  Cramer generally makes his recommendations after market close but this backtest is taking the price at market close.

Anyone can beat the market if you regularly offer them yesterday's closing price today."
2021-04-18 11:32:15,wallstreetbets,"True. I mean when you are making more than 200 recommendations a month, you can guess how much DD must have gone into each one. The idea here that I wanted to check is if he is big enough to move the market."
2021-04-18 11:42:54,wallstreetbets,i would say he minced words more with tsla so he could always be right
2021-04-18 11:34:46,wallstreetbets,He was fucking dead wrong on Bear Sterns too
2021-04-18 13:46:50,wallstreetbets,Cramer changed his opinion on Tesla way before it rocketed. He was talking Tesla up in December of 2019 and had great things to say about it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a believer‚Äù
2021-04-18 11:59:59,wallstreetbets,Isn‚Äôt he paid to say shit? So when the Hedgies are against GME Cramer is naturally on their side. Money talks
2021-04-18 12:01:28,wallstreetbets,"Yeah great analysis OP, no comparison to a randomly selected batch of stonks."
2021-04-18 13:09:45,wallstreetbets,"Except he still very much outperformed the market, and his sell recommendations were also successful."
2021-04-18 17:38:48,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for giving me some hope. I can‚Äôt believe the lack of comments pointing this out. 

He‚Äôs summing the gains and losses. So if you have two stocks losing 50% each, he says it‚Äôs a cumulative loss of 100% on those two stocks."
2021-04-18 16:36:52,wallstreetbets,I wonder the same and I also wonder how a 555% return on the one day time frame is possible
2021-04-18 13:36:56,wallstreetbets,came here to say this.
2021-04-18 13:51:57,wallstreetbets,"OPs words were to the effect: If Cramer said buy on the 15th night he took the closing price from the 15th day and compared it to the closing price on the 16th day.

So, if you wanted the 555% you would purchase the stock on opening of the 16th and sell it at the close of the 16th."
2021-04-18 12:04:29,wallstreetbets,Get a room
2021-04-18 13:45:37,wallstreetbets,"I would argue until Tesla got over $400 it was an incredibly risky investment.  Forget all the tech genius stuff, its hard to make cars for reasons unrelated to intelligence.  

Hell, the company was only weeks away from insolvency when they built a production line out of spare parts in a parking lot tent city.  That is a huge risk proposition.  Hats off to Musk, but anyone who doubted Tesla before $400 ended up wrong, but they weren‚Äôt being foolish."
2021-04-18 13:10:02,wallstreetbets,"Fundamentally speaking, Tesla is and was never a good investment. There is nothing wrong with a fund manager being wrong on tesla. Tesla is a revolutionary success story."
2021-04-18 11:28:44,wallstreetbets,Doesn‚Äôt matter how he is right... If I can make money off it.

2021-04-18 13:17:38,wallstreetbets,"Depends on what the sample is and what the variance is, past performance can absolutely give you an indication of what the future will hold. If someone got 100/100 picks right, that didn‚Äôt happen purely by chance, they are clearly skillful. 

You would have to do the math to see if these results are statistically significant."

2021-04-18 15:13:54,wallstreetbets,"When I was a lurker *in bulgaria* it seemed like it was there, much less prevalent though. 

The ones who jumped on during GME you could argue were just FOMOing. And I would bet there‚Äôs a big cross over on the FOMO-ers and pump and dump chasers venn diagram"
2021-04-18 16:07:37,wallstreetbets,"A few years ago there wasn't as much P&D noise here.  There were a few standouts like MU and AMD where there was some of it, but mostly it was just screenshots of people losing or making money, or finding some loophole to exploit (box spread arb guy, infinite leverage, personal risk tolerance guy, etc.).  Honestly I find the state of the sub kind of sad.  Every day you have to filter through so much meaningless garbage about the same tired meme stocks to find anything interesting."
2021-04-18 16:41:14,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs almost as shitty as stocktwats now
2021-04-18 18:43:03,wallstreetbets,Thank you for this.
2021-04-18 16:16:43,wallstreetbets,"> His one day returns are because people dive in (or out) the moment he makes a recommendation.

What's wrong with that? If you make money nearly every day from his picks and then get out, what's the issue? That sounds like a winning strategy to me, but it sounds like you're poopooing it.

Buy. Take profit. Sell. Move to the next.

Holding until you lose is retarded."
2021-04-18 17:18:38,wallstreetbets,"\>you get better DD from WSB  
sure and then lose anyway  
you may as well do the pump and dump"
2021-04-18 18:50:40,wallstreetbets,Because it's legal
2021-04-18 11:37:12,wallstreetbets,More like multiple specific stocks
2021-04-18 12:19:38,wallstreetbets,"Pretty simple, someone rich tells him to say ""sell ABC"", people sell, price dips, rich guy cashes in on puts and buys ABC low, price goes up, cashes in on calls, and that's how you make money lol"
2021-04-18 12:07:42,wallstreetbets,"That's kinda his whole mo.

Paid by large firms to pump so they can dump after."
2021-04-18 12:08:01,wallstreetbets,"He must and does release full disclosure. If he didn‚Äôt, he would be put in jail"
2021-04-18 15:42:51,wallstreetbets,no but he'll tell you he holds the stocks in his chartiable trust lmao
2021-04-18 13:43:39,wallstreetbets,"He literally interviews thousands of company‚Äôs, it is not specific and he is actually pretty impartial overall, often saying I don‚Äôt endorse this company."
2021-04-18 15:34:24,wallstreetbets,"There is a video out there of him explaining how to manipulate the markets for stocks hes losing money on, including making fake news, and sharing it to news companies and using large capital to move the markets around. Hes obviously moving it on his behalf."
2021-04-18 12:28:57,wallstreetbets,I can tell you for sure my company and all companies on mad money/the street do this.  And it always works.  Which is why they all do it.  I‚Äôm not totally sure there is anything illegal about that.  But I‚Äôm just a dumb ü¶ç
2021-04-18 15:43:10,wallstreetbets,How do any of you know that DFV was not paid to pump his dick to GameStop for months and months to create a frenzy? The Cramer hate here is retarded.
2021-04-18 14:20:00,wallstreetbets,Nah man they just advertise on his show for marketing specific purposes and has nothing to do with him boosting their stocks.
2021-04-18 11:56:22,wallstreetbets,"Ya, if u r holding a stock and he says buy, you sell the next day. He's basically a 24 hr pump guy. 

You need to buy at the moment he says buy and sell the next day. Buy a few minutes too late and sp already moved."
2021-04-18 12:09:01,wallstreetbets,Liking or hating someone should never influence investments
2021-04-18 14:20:44,wallstreetbets,Just short everything he says and hold for a month. You get in on the high and ride the tide low.
2021-04-18 14:35:31,wallstreetbets,"1 guy with a huge viewership says ""buy.""

His boomer viewers buy - price goes up.

2021-04-18 12:20:08,wallstreetbets,"When did you get the price, the day after he recommends buy, or the day of?

He makes recommendations at 6pm, so you should look at the day after, since the market is closed for retail investors."
2021-04-18 17:27:03,wallstreetbets,"Buy the next morning at open and sell by close. Either blindly buy all picks or use analysis to filter by highest probability. 

Buy puts set to expire in 1 month. Buy more shares at 1 month. 

Swing or position trade after that. 

If you played his picks that way every day/week/month, you‚Äôd probably average 10% per week. That‚Äôs a ***very*** rough estimate. 

Easier play is to short his buy picks and exit at 1 month. Not sure what the gains would be there. I don‚Äôt short stock. I‚Äôll place bets a stock price will drop, but shorting is literally an attempt to *force* it down. It‚Äôs beyond fucked. Might as well kneecap the front desk receptionist."

2021-04-18 15:04:36,wallstreetbets,"Sure, buy Puts on anything he recommends."
2021-04-18 15:33:38,wallstreetbets,"What buy and sell price are you using for the one day returns though? $5 says by the time you buy after he says something, you‚Äôre the one providing returns to someone else."
2021-04-18 15:43:51,wallstreetbets,"I'm bout to smack you with a rolled up newspaper. Yes, you can buy for an increased price the next day most likely and then long-term hold. Congrats, you're investing with extra steps."
2021-04-18 19:59:37,wallstreetbets,I didn't...... loved the show though to
2021-04-18 16:45:12,wallstreetbets,That doesn't mean that the people that pay him for the show aren't investing in those stocks. Or the hedge funds that know those people.
2021-04-18 12:18:19,wallstreetbets,"He stated what he was buying, disclosed his position, and presented DD and a strongly worded encouragement to DYOR. He and a thousand other YouTube stock channels are doing nothing different from one another. If he'd lost his investment, no one would be calling for him to be sued.

If someone says: ""Buy this stock. It's GOING to go UP."" That's misleading. If someone says, ""I bought this stock because, based on the information here, I believe it's going to go up,"" and you copy their investment, it might create a feedback loop, or it might not. If you think DFV manipulated the stock with his paltry 100k shares, versus the billions that were leveraged against the stock going up, you haven't been paying attention."
2021-04-18 12:17:39,wallstreetbets,"A) he is being sued. 
B) take my downvote."
2021-04-18 12:31:06,wallstreetbets,"Fairly certain that Cramer's investments are in a trust which he does not manage, similar to how presidents manage their wealth during their tenure."
2021-04-18 13:39:30,wallstreetbets,Like the pelosi buying millions in tesla right before that energy/green bill was signed
2021-04-18 13:43:15,wallstreetbets,I mean McAfee got arrested because he wasn‚Äôt telling people he had a position in the crypto currencies he recommended right?
2021-04-18 17:19:47,wallstreetbets,"I believe Cramer only controls a trust and he isn‚Äôt allowed to buy or sell a stock for 3 days if he has been mentioned in the show. 

His personal investments are limited just like everyone else on CNBC. I think they are only allowed to own mutual funds or something. 

Point is there are already rules to prevent abusing this type of thing."
2021-04-18 18:04:16,wallstreetbets,He legally can't own stocks
2021-04-18 12:45:29,wallstreetbets,Exactly
2021-04-18 18:47:38,wallstreetbets,Any public figure will be good at telling you what is going up after their endorsement. You can‚Äôt really analyze it without that caveat. It‚Äôs no different than the Buffett or Wood effect short term.
2021-04-18 12:59:12,wallstreetbets,"Look at the first trade of the day, not pre market.  Not sure how to get the data, personally If you use your data , I think it is flawed because everyone is trying to get in for a ‚Äúpop‚Äù and short term trade. But a lot of work in your part"
2021-04-18 13:19:33,wallstreetbets,">Cramer made the recommendation on15th night. I will compare the stock prices of the 15th close vs the 16th close

So... in other words, if we buy before he makes the recommendation, then we get to see big returns?"
2021-04-18 17:10:47,wallstreetbets,"Your data is heavily skewed, an investor wouldn‚Äôt get these returns because he is getting in at open price, not previous close"
2021-04-18 13:21:52,wallstreetbets,Would a safer move be to short his recommended stocks the day after they jump?
2021-04-18 12:47:00,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough, now I know what to yolo at 9:30 AM"
2021-04-18 13:29:15,wallstreetbets,Maybe a 5 day short on his buy calls. This would work.
2021-04-18 12:41:49,wallstreetbets,"What time does he have that show, after hours? How would you play these? Buy the open sell the close the next day for the daily play?"
2021-04-18 17:09:09,wallstreetbets,Can you do open to close on the day after the recommendation?
2021-04-18 15:41:03,wallstreetbets,Your method is worthless.
2021-04-18 16:47:45,wallstreetbets,You should do an additional research based on his alertplus picks.
2021-04-18 15:06:28,wallstreetbets,The full WSB package
2021-04-18 11:51:35,wallstreetbets,"The random walk theory, does not actually apply to real world stock data though.

Take for instance the averages on the s&p 500:

The percentage of stock market days up from ‚Äò96 ‚Äì 2016 was 53.29%. The percentage of stock market days down was 46.71%.

So with using that data set you would see a 7ish percent return through any sort of random picking of stock.

I assume Kramer's pics are heavily weighted in s&p 500 stocks."
2021-04-18 11:58:10,wallstreetbets,"I'll be back after I pretend to research and think about this more. I was just thinking you would benchmark to the number of stocks that went up the day of his pick so you can compare to just buying the ""average stock"" like an index (on average, maybe 53%? Not that it matters whatever. Im retarded anyway.).)."

2021-04-18 11:52:17,wallstreetbets,Any more and he will blow out a coronary
2021-04-18 11:44:53,wallstreetbets,Wait is Bear Stress not fine? He said they were fine last I checked.
2021-04-18 14:41:56,wallstreetbets,"He is paid but not by a hedge fund, no."
2021-04-18 17:09:23,wallstreetbets,Atreyu\_n\_Falcor\_BFF's favorite movie is about a kid reading a giant book but he couldn't even make it to the halfway point of the post.
2021-04-18 13:56:09,wallstreetbets,Except you're not going to get that 555% since it will OPEN at the gap up already.  You need to buy _on the 15th_ to get that.  Bad math
2021-04-18 14:50:10,wallstreetbets,"Hels, delet this"
2021-04-18 13:18:43,wallstreetbets,"I get that. But when he then says ""I've liked tesla all along"" it gets irritating."
2021-04-18 11:34:30,wallstreetbets,"Right, this might be a strategy. Buy very short term on a stock he reccomends then sell next day and possibly even short it until next month when it tanks."
2021-04-18 12:06:04,wallstreetbets,"You cant make money off it because by the time youve got in, you lost your edge. OPs stats are wrong because theyre not based on the first trade after his recommendation. Its also assuming you can get in first."
2021-04-18 12:26:19,wallstreetbets,"The issue is, you can't. Ops data was comparing previous day close to Cramer day close. Cramer tells you what you should have bought Yesterday."
2021-04-18 17:22:42,wallstreetbets,You would have a lot of child support.
2021-04-18 12:35:21,wallstreetbets,"Yea but those percentages are not alternating days. They are mostly up for a long time, then mostly down for a short time. That is where the market is ""going up"" 75% of the time. If the days were alternating there would be no crashes and it would not be going up as nearly as fast."
2021-04-18 15:41:26,wallstreetbets,Cool! Nice work!

2021-04-18 17:57:37,wallstreetbets,Don't forget that with GME WSB jumped up multiple millions of people. So the ability for a popular stock on WSB to get pumped just from WSB members increased significantly too.
2021-04-18 15:42:01,wallstreetbets,Yeah I hear you. Thanks for your perspective!
2021-04-18 16:08:44,wallstreetbets,When i was a young lurker in Bulgaria...

2021-04-18 16:08:20,wallstreetbets,FOMO and pump and dump go hand in hand imo. The best way to dump is to when the price starts eeking out it‚Äôs potential you make everyone else think it‚Äôs only like halfway there. Then sell off as it rises a little more til some other catch on and break the rise because they dump fast and hard. Idk that‚Äôs how merchant clans did it back in the day on RuneScape and that‚Äôs where I attended university at sooo don‚Äôt listen to my retarded ass I‚Äôm just here for the frosties.
2021-04-18 18:09:14,wallstreetbets,"Amen, been lurking stay since TSLA and MSFT calls it's changed a lot since then"
2021-04-18 17:08:33,wallstreetbets,The trick is to buy the stock right before Cramer starts talking about it.
2021-04-18 17:20:48,wallstreetbets,"The way these scammers operate is by building credibly long term via offering small wins over an extended time frame, wins that would probably would have got anyway since they are so obvious like Tesla etc... but when big event comes around is when they do the fliparoo and pull the rug from out under you and the loss is so big, all the small wins are negligible but you don‚Äôt know until it‚Äôs too late because you‚Äôve developed a habit of trust."
2021-04-18 18:12:17,wallstreetbets,The thing is Cramer makes these buy recommendations so HFs can unload their losers
2021-04-18 16:32:37,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm all for making money. If you can make money off a Cramer, go for it. Long term though, you will lose more than you make with him."

2021-04-18 12:56:25,wallstreetbets,Yeah I guess he‚Äôs the real FD
2021-04-18 17:36:22,wallstreetbets,DFV had two viewers of his livestream when he first talked about his position in GME. Two. No one was paying him to sway two people lol. Hundreds of thousands of people watch Cramer - it's a totally different ball game.
2021-04-18 16:43:33,wallstreetbets,"Or do nothing the day he says buy a stock. Then after the stock jumps on price, buy puts against it. Sell to close the puts, at a profit, after the stock drops again."
2021-04-18 13:07:48,wallstreetbets,"Except the graphs OP posted shows it wasn‚Äôt just 24 hour holds that were profitable.

Edit: apparently, however, OP just added up the percentages of the 600+ stocks, instead of writing the averages in the post"
2021-04-18 13:11:02,wallstreetbets,"But you have to have the stock first. What are the odds you're just minding your business holding a stock he says to sell, and you're paying attention to him every day until your one stock gets mentioned?

I think the point is that you need to know which to buy before taking advice on selling."
2021-04-18 17:20:33,wallstreetbets,"Cramer‚Äôs show airs after market close. You ain‚Äôt buying shit the minute he says ‚Äúbuy‚Äù. 

His picks are up ***by close of market the next day***. That means you could buy at open and sell by close and be up 54% of the time. 600+ picks with a 54% win rate and 555% cumulative gain comes around to around 1.5% per win. If you just buy whatever he says to buy, you‚Äôre looking at 0.8% average per stock. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúminutes too late‚Äù. 

49% of picks are still up 1 week later. They don‚Äôt dip until after that. 1 month later everything is negative. However, ***50%+ of his picks have made a cumulative gain of 400%+ year to date***. That means long holds will keep gaining. 

Literally the opposite of a 24 hour pump guy. Nobody should ever listen to you about anything because you can‚Äôt fucking read."

Bruh. It‚Äôs taxed as income. Your logic and everyone else saying they don‚Äôt wanna make more money because you pay more in taxes is not retarded. It‚Äôs just plain dumb. The only way you pay more in taxes is (here‚Äôs the kicker) IF YOU ARE MAKING MONEY and you wouldn‚Äôt ever pay more in taxes than the highest income tax rate so 37% (under normal conditions not talking about wash sales and other goofy shit that is preventable). And again, short term gains are taxed as income. So let‚Äôs call apples apples. Short term gains and income from a job are equal (aside from one having taxes taken out throughout the year) so based on that logic would you also refuse a raise from your employer with the excuse BuT tHeN iLl PaY mOrE iN tAxEs!!! No. You wouldn‚Äôt refuse that raise. So get that garbage illogical excuse out of here, especially at WallStreetBETS of all places."

2021-04-18 17:19:31,wallstreetbets,"Agree with this. Also, timing of the overall macro economic fluctuations probably has more to do with buying any stock. For example, majority of stocks went up between 2002 and 2008, or 20010 and 2019, or March 2020 until now, so it's not really a 50/50 up or down, it's that majority of s&p500 stocks went up if they were recommended during those times, and majority of stocks went down when recommended during an overall market correction. 

The true analysis would be to narrow the recommendations down to just those in the s&p500, and of all 500 hundred stocks on any given day, did the one Cramer recommended go higher of lower than the s&p500 average over the next day/month/year?"

2021-04-18 14:11:29,wallstreetbets,"Working and Day-Trading is completely different.

If I work-extra and get paid more, you pay marginal taxes on that extra money and you are still well-off.

Trading -- You have good years and bad years.

Let's say you make +$50,000 one year and -$40,000 the next year. You should be up +$10,000, right?

No.

The Year you made $50,000, you only make $30,000 and the year you lose $40,000 (you only get to write off $3000 of taxes owed from some other income), let's give you the benefit of the doubt and you take advantage of $3000 tax write off, So you only lost $37,000

But, net-net you still are -$7000 from these two years.

OTOH, if you a buy-and-hold S&P, you are ahead by $10,000.

Taxes absolutely matters in trading. So, you have to make up for the $17,000 difference with your skill. But, 99.99% don't beat the market"
2021-04-18 12:20:03,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs taxed as unearned income aka it‚Äôs a pretty low rate
2021-04-18 14:38:59,wallstreetbets,Tell that to the German finance minister. Since this year you can actually be taxed at more than 100% on options/futures/cfds.
2021-04-18 15:48:38,wallstreetbets,Yeah man. If you think about it short term gains are better than our 9-5s because no FICA taxes. It‚Äôs like working two jobs for the price of one. Such an understated bonus if you ask me.
2021-04-18 13:14:04,wallstreetbets,">BuT tHeN iLl PaY mOrE iN tAxEs!!! No. You wouldn‚Äôt.

On what planet does this make sense?

If you make more money you'll be taxed on more money. Pretty sure that's how percentages work, not to mention what happens when that raise bumps you into a higher tax bracket.

I agree with what you're saying though, I just found it ironically funny that you say earning a higher income won't mean higher taxes."
2021-04-18 13:31:12,wallstreetbets,"You can't determine what is and isn't manipulation of a security just by the success one has after talking about it. 

Dfv bought months ago. As in, when it was worth less than $10. Back then he didn't have the subscribers he did now, and even if he did, nobody believed him because it took until January for people to start buying gamestonk. Hell, I'd argue most of the 10 million people on this sub haven't watched a single one of his youtube videos (for reference, I  haven't) and for that fact, this sub only had somewhere around 3 million users before January. 

The only difference between what dfv has done and the DDs that get posted here on a daily basis is that dfv got it right. 

If I posted a DD on ASO before it's earnings report and it's rise to $30, would that have been manipulation? See where the fallacy lives now?"
2021-04-18 13:47:52,wallstreetbets,"Cramer has a known effect on the market. It's realistic to believe that he doesn't manage his own positions because to do so would be blatant manipulation and it would cost him everything. 

At the time when DFV/RoaringKitty was establishing his positions, he was doing so on his own, and posting his YOLOs for what they were: Here's what *I'm* doing with *my* money. Let's see what happens.

He wasn't working with insider information, he was working with the information he'd gathered from chart-watching. Go look at his socialblade to watch the user-follow trend from April 2020 when his investment began until January 2021 when it exploded. He was unknown outside of his niche communities. He had less than 20k subs until December of 2020, long after securing the vast majority of his positions. There *was* no ""DFV Effect."" 

That said, if he did the same thing tomorrow, I might be inclined to completely agree with you. But I just can't by looking what's happening now versus when DFV began placing his positions."

It isn't really the past performance that is dictating future movement. It's the fact that you have underlying companies that are growing at a steady pace.

The S and P 500 is also not a zero-sum game. You don't have to have a loser to have a winner. If you don't even have to have money going into the system in order to have an increase in growth, or vice versa.

Anyway you cut it on average, you are going to get about a 7% upward return on the S&P 500. It is not a 50/50 on the day. This has been true for its history. There's basically no way at this point you could balance its statistics. If it were to average out in a 50/50, it would take an incredible amount of data contrary to its history.

2021-04-18 19:45:35,wallstreetbets,No fica taxes aka lower than working a regularly job
2021-04-18 14:18:59,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but even in context, I could've quoted the whole thing and still doesn't make sense lol. Paid more? Taxed more.

Now if you wanted unrelated comparison, there are people who refuse raises because it takes them out of government assistance thresholds, but I would still never say you don't pay more taxes when you earn more money, tax loopholes aside.

It's still really odd that you would throw that little ""more pay ‚â† more taxes"" point in there, no matter how ya slice it."

Besides nowadays you just serve a non profit or get book deals where people buy millions of books then donate them to pay you back. Rather they just run stuff themselves and not hide it behind obscure layers."

2021-04-18 14:46:19,wallstreetbets,"Stocks regularly pop overnight. 

Over the last 20 years if you bought the indexes at close and sold at open you'd have ~400% returns. If you bought at open and sold at close you'd have ~0% returns. If you can get the stock at the price Cramer recommends the stock, looks like it is a good deal. But you can't.

Also, even if it does go to zero, that does not mean that it will have 50% up days and 50% down days. War, natural disaster, disease, societal collapse, vast political change. Any of these could bring that SPX to zero in a matter of days, weeks, months. If any of that happens we would not have this magical 50/50 return set.

We are not dealing with a zero sum game and a closed system that is fair. You can't rely on things evening out. They don't even out to zero."

2021-04-18 13:39:55,wallstreetbets,This is why it‚Äôs important to have a long time horizon. All of our growth names might be down 30-50% this quarter but Tesla had a similar draw down and was flat for years before taking off

Their recent earnings didn't make the market go wow, but that was because (as they openly said) they were in the middle of selling some pieces of their massive patent portfolio that don't relate to their primary business focus. By the next quarter earning I would expect that to be completed, which will result in a massive cash influx and when that happens the market should react appropriately. Frankly, with all of the deals they've made over the past year I think a positive earnings report is all the catalyst that's needed for the stock to grow substantially (I hope to double)."

Don't listen to what these clowns say. Buying 1k shares and selling 10monthly covered calls is bullish and one of the more stable approaches you can have to long-term wealth development. Collecting premium if the price stays down to add to your shares. If the price goes up, you sell at a profit and collect premium. The ONLY way you lose money on the underlying shares is if the company bankrupts or never recovers to the point where covered calls < loss on underlying."

&#x200B;

Next update - I plan highlight all the industries KT is involved in and update everyone on the most recent news, since most of it comes out in just korean. Absolute beast in the making, here's a preview of the post structure (could take me a LONG time to really get it out) that I'm working through via a mind map - [https://miro.com/app/board/o9J\_lLS1JWc=/](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)"
2021-04-18 15:14:02,wallstreetbets,I've had this in my long-term for a while üî• buying under $10 was a steal. Steady long term growth love it
2021-04-18 09:57:45,wallstreetbets,"Looks like long term support at $11.75, short term support at $11.12.

Long term trend down.  Next resistance $13.30."
2021-04-18 12:42:54,wallstreetbets,How is this oversold? The chart is telling me overbought instead...
2021-04-18 15:55:32,wallstreetbets,"Op, why did you choose 17c instead of 15c? I'm new to options. Wouldn't 15c be more likely ITM and if it hits 17 make you more money?"
2021-04-18 19:41:03,wallstreetbets,Half a billion usd in income last year is pretty decent for a company that has a market cap of 6 billion.
2021-04-18 09:54:28,wallstreetbets,Positions or ban
2021-04-18 11:17:07,wallstreetbets,What's the catalyst for July though?
2021-04-18 14:44:44,wallstreetbets,Very solid foundation for value that is catapulting into growth.
2021-04-18 14:48:09,wallstreetbets,Keep in mind the buybacks will continue till Nov 2021 and as of Feb. that was around 8.5 million shares they won't have to pay dividends on since they are treasury shares.
2021-04-18 19:18:40,wallstreetbets,already crossed TLVX you‚Äôre not expecting pb?
2021-04-18 15:28:22,wallstreetbets,Hey you cannot say ‚ÄúI like the stock‚Äù for this ticker! That phrase belongs to one stock only and I think we all know which one it is üñïüíéüëê
2021-04-18 12:05:12,wallstreetbets,"I read thru their Annual and Quarterly reports and they are changing into a ‚Äúdigico‚Äù (digital company). They‚Äôre moving away from just providing 5g/broadband. 

I‚Äôm curious as to when that DD was posted. The last 6 months seem bullish to me"
2021-04-18 17:30:49,wallstreetbets,I made some money on that DD.
2021-04-18 09:49:39,wallstreetbets,Haha ya - I love me some technical analysis!
2021-04-18 14:02:50,wallstreetbets,"Glad to see someone agrees with me! Sorry if calls get more expensive. My original concern was it being a foreign company but good to know there is some general consensus here. I read thru everything on Stocktwits last night and this company really has good PR after PR. 

Hoping ER crushes in two weeks and I have time to load up on calls beforehand!"
2021-04-18 11:28:43,wallstreetbets,"At first I was like, this is the dumbest idea ever.  But $15c's are looking REAL cheap."
2021-04-18 12:54:13,wallstreetbets,"Definitely not oversold, but it is undervalued. The real estate alone is worth a significant part of their $6 billion in market cap. If you consider the actual businesses, it's insanely undervalued."
2021-04-18 16:07:32,wallstreetbets,Tbh just less capital at the moment. If I‚Äôm gonna yolo want to accumulate more contracts and I‚Äôm bullish. But if you can buy the $15 and have the $$$$ to do so then ya it def makes sense
2021-04-18 19:50:44,wallstreetbets,"The farther OTM they are , the harder they hit"
2021-04-18 09:58:03,wallstreetbets,Will update Monday once I have them. Small caps have murdered my account...need some free funds first - also wanting to make sure it actually dips into the channel before I buy
2021-04-18 11:22:03,wallstreetbets,There isn't one - it's so you don't get Theta fucked. ER is risky and even if good it could drop the week after (sell the news) and then have it rocket.
2021-04-18 19:48:56,wallstreetbets,No I am - fill the gap first then moon
2021-04-18 16:19:33,wallstreetbets,"Hey retard, have a downdoot because I like to do it."
2021-04-18 12:52:31,wallstreetbets,"Problem is that every big telco is doing the same, including most of the Tier 1 providers. I could be wrong though!"
2021-04-18 10:12:50,wallstreetbets,Do you trade volatile stocks at all?
2021-04-18 14:41:23,wallstreetbets,"The words over bought and oversold our technical terms. The words undervalue and overvalued our personal opinions. 

If it‚Äôs showing that it‚Äôs  bought and sold normally than that is the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù that the market currently give sit"
2021-04-18 11:27:53,wallstreetbets,On second thought god damn those options are cheap... How'd you find this lol.  Maybe $15c's are actually worth it.  Basically 10 bucks per contract?  This stock is HELLA stable though.
2021-04-18 11:23:18,wallstreetbets,What if the news is terrible?
2021-04-18 13:25:03,wallstreetbets,"Tell me which other telco company is yelling to investors that they are ""focusing on ABC""... AI, Big Data and Cloud Services (or some similar cutting edge, for a telco, mission statement).

You're not understanding that KT already has brand reputation/respect of Google/Microsoft/etc. in Korea and the capability to expand like them. You look at ATT or Verizon in the United States and think robotics? Cloud services? Education platforms? You think of a Verizon AI service bot giving you room service at your favorite hotel? Definitely not, but KT is positioning themselves, not just in Korea, but in SE Asia as a major player for these industries and more (content distribution, content IP, energy, healthcare, hospitality, etc.).

Look at Korean tech adoption rates and you'll see it's very high- they are already testing so much stuff we could only dream of in USA. Besides that, they said they are going to focus on acquisitions, too... so if they are smart they can capitalize on that like Softbank, Yahoo (alibaba position), etc."
2021-04-18 10:15:21,wallstreetbets,Yep - majority of my account is small caps that got obliterated by the shorts over the last month
2021-04-18 11:32:33,wallstreetbets,Right - the options are super cheap. Even if the news is bad in May you still have 2 months to recover before expiry. From what I can tell they are similar to the US version of ATT or Verizon. I have a stock screener I use to find them ;)
2021-04-18 14:11:13,wallstreetbets,"Three as an example:

\- NTT have a whole arm for big data, named NTT Data that focuses on your ABC.

\- Deutsche Telekom offer an edge compute solution, basically encompassing your ABC. ([https://www.t-systems.com/de/de/events-messen/performantes-datenmanagement-mit-big-data](https://www.t-systems.com/de/de/events-messen/performantes-datenmanagement-mit-big-data))

\- PCCW have Infinitum. Encompasses Cloud, AI, and Data. ([https://www.pccwsolutions.com/site/en/infinitum/infinitum](https://www.pccwsolutions.com/site/en/infinitum/infinitum))

I'm not saying KT are small, but these guys are huge and have global connectivity so multinational corps would be able to home all of their services with the same provider. TBH, all of the providers look like they're trying to monetize the edge now.

I'm not trying to argue the value of the play - this could still be and probably will be a good play, I'm just trying to point out that there will be global competition for KT in offering those services."
2021-04-18 10:17:58,wallstreetbets,So that's why you're being safe lol...my accounts keep getting obliterated but unlike you I havent learned my lesson lol its like an addiction
2021-04-18 11:55:00,wallstreetbets,Just did a review order and the exchange / commissions seem insane though.
2021-04-18 18:42:47,wallstreetbets,I appreciate your response and looked briefly into all those. I don't think those companies can compare to KT's ambition to enter new industries and transform to a digital platform company.
2021-04-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Markets are at all time highs and I still managed to lose 3200 on Friday in expired Calls with more losses upcoming Friday. 
2021-04-18 10:11:19,wallstreetbets,Options explained: you have the OPTION to lose your money very quickly or you have the OPTION to lose it almost immediately.
2021-04-18 10:14:44,wallstreetbets,Im very confused why anyone would ride a 100 AMD call to expiration.
2021-04-18 10:12:47,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs why I only invest in gas station dick pill companies
2021-04-18 08:52:18,wallstreetbets,"My portfolio is all red, too. You are in it with a lot of people. Just enjoy your weekend and worry later."
2021-04-18 08:42:39,wallstreetbets,"The market is green but most people's positions are red because the top companies within the S&P 500 are carrying the whole market on their backs.


Edit: holy blowup Batman. Probably my most upvoted comment across all my reddit accounts. Lol. Thanks for the awards as well, but please, use that money towards HODL'ing your favorite meme stocks/crypto coins instead of on me. #ToTheMoon!"
2021-04-18 08:30:40,wallstreetbets,"options - even when you‚Äôre right, you‚Äôre wrong"
2021-04-18 09:18:51,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations sir, you might be taking losses, but you will be recognized as a certified retard in this wonderful community. This is the way"
2021-04-18 09:47:11,wallstreetbets,"I was almost hoping to see PLTR in there. got greedy when she hit 25$ Tuesday, thought it was only up from there, kept the calls, now instead of 140% gains that turned to 100% loss more fun than a scratch-off tho lol"
2021-04-18 14:48:00,wallstreetbets,"Me too, despite my best efforts. I guess it comes with the territory."
2021-04-18 10:00:44,wallstreetbets,Please explain to me your thought process as to how CRM was going to get anywhere near your strike by that date.
2021-04-18 09:03:12,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I‚Äôm not sure where the market is going up... all I see is red, except in the indexes."
2021-04-18 10:17:52,wallstreetbets,Your loses are mostly guaranteed when you buy options out-of-the-money that far.There should be no surprise here.
2021-04-18 09:35:33,wallstreetbets,"Buying calls or puts have been always hit and miss for me. But selling puts whenever good names drop is close to 99% success for me, sold puts atleast 50+ times and have never been assigned.

I was selling puts on names which im ready to hold - AMD,NKE, MSFT,WMT,AMZN, INTC ,BABA to name a few."
2021-04-18 08:52:34,wallstreetbets,Market movement has nothing to do with options. Success in options are purely based on the correctness of your speculation. You can lose money on a stock that doubles if you thought it would triple.
2021-04-18 09:16:09,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve crawled my way back from many losses, roughly 10k being the most. It‚Äôs not a good sight but there is money to made every day in the battlefield and even with some of the stupid comments on here. But if you can‚Äôt watch the market all day every day, then I do not suggest weekly options as a viable strategy to generate wealth. Go ATM a few months out and cut losses at your desired risk, mine is 15-25% loss. If I‚Äôm positive a few a weeks ahead then I‚Äôll sell and use profit to buy shares. I won‚Äôt be a millionaire anytime soon but I also won‚Äôt be broke either. 

Yes, options trading can be a casino but only if you treat it like one."
2021-04-18 09:20:28,wallstreetbets,"What the fuck are those strikes!?

Please explain, 100C on AMD? What???"
2021-04-18 13:03:49,wallstreetbets,If it makes you feel better the idiots that manage my pension plan actually managed to lose money throughout 2020.
2021-04-18 08:34:52,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs 100% how it goes. I‚Äôm heading for a hard mental breakdown on Tuesday when sndl doesn‚Äôt go up on 4/20
2021-04-18 08:55:13,wallstreetbets,Fwiw the markets' are at an all time high a lot.
2021-04-18 09:37:53,wallstreetbets,Portfolio taking a 30% cut... I'd be crying if I wasn't already laughing at how everything is üí≤‚úîÔ∏èexcept the dumpsterüóëÔ∏èüî• fire I hold. Btw I hold $QS ü§°
2021-04-18 09:37:25,wallstreetbets,Are you me? Lost 3000 Friday on expired calld
2021-04-18 10:14:16,wallstreetbets,Spreading out and diversifying your losses. Good retard.
2021-04-18 10:14:58,wallstreetbets,Fcel gang
2021-04-18 09:57:52,wallstreetbets,Markets are all time high but I‚Äôm down 60% with fucking $BB.
2021-04-18 10:40:39,wallstreetbets,"Fun fact: you don‚Äôt have to hold options to expiry. In fact, if your thesis remains the same, you can and should probably roll your OTM long calls about 21 days to expiry to avoid the steepest time decay. If you like the stock, stay in the trade, but just in a more option-efficient manner! That said, if you want to just be a degenerate and gamble on weeklies, go right ahead lol"
2021-04-18 11:03:46,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs a great example of so called wealth redistribution. When dumb money goes to smart money. Good job!
2021-04-18 12:23:14,wallstreetbets,Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
2021-04-18 10:09:15,wallstreetbets,Why didn't you buy SPY calls instead of retarded calls?
2021-04-18 08:49:56,wallstreetbets,"I have amd call expiry this Friday 85 C so.. most likely I am gonna lose money too. 
Let‚Äôs see,"
2021-04-18 10:03:51,wallstreetbets,Why let them expire? Cut your losers quickly. Theta decay ramps up hard closer to expiration
2021-04-18 09:28:01,wallstreetbets,3200$ is postable?
2021-04-18 09:56:10,wallstreetbets,My spy 400c was a week too early
2021-04-18 10:19:19,wallstreetbets,Buy indexes leave it alone
2021-04-18 09:35:59,wallstreetbets,Man so much red for so much green ... weird af... ape no get it
2021-04-18 09:37:43,wallstreetbets,Buy TSLA and hold! That‚Äôs all you need to do
2021-04-18 09:26:54,wallstreetbets,"Volatility has also contracted a lot in the last while. It‚Äôs been a bad time over the last while to be a buyer, but a great time as a seller."
2021-04-18 10:01:26,wallstreetbets,We are definitely spinning the whole: ‚Äúbuy low sell high‚Äù thing on its head.
2021-04-18 10:29:00,wallstreetbets,Now I know and will only trade faang stocks when spy does a meteor dunk.
2021-04-18 11:11:23,wallstreetbets,I bought month out ITM SPY calls.  Don't worry. This will crash the market for sure!
2021-04-18 11:19:03,wallstreetbets,Here's how to take screenshots on most platforms: https://screenshot.help/
2021-04-18 14:25:17,wallstreetbets,Just play SPY and make a 50/50 game.
2021-04-18 15:20:43,wallstreetbets,"Yo, did anyone else hear about the New Jersey deli listed on the stock market? They did 35k in sales last year, valuation on the market is over 100 mil lol. Must make a mean sandwich. Can't mention the ticker or I'll get banned"
2021-04-18 10:18:55,wallstreetbets,They are shorting small cap growth stocks like crazy. So no wonder
2021-04-18 10:18:45,wallstreetbets,"You're not very good at futures trading, are you?"
2021-04-18 10:46:17,wallstreetbets,"buying OTM calls on boomer stocks like Nike, FedEx, FCEL and Salesforce that literally have no volatility?!

This is the way."
2021-04-18 09:16:29,wallstreetbets,I was up almost 10% 2 weeks ago overall. Now I'm only up about 1.5% overall
2021-04-18 10:09:55,wallstreetbets,You are not alone. I am in same boat
2021-04-18 10:21:24,wallstreetbets,Epic! Good work sir üòÜüòÜüòÜ
2021-04-18 10:25:52,wallstreetbets,All time high my ass. Was there a time warp and we are back in January? Fucking fake news!
2021-04-18 10:28:36,wallstreetbets,And here we go...
2021-04-18 10:30:46,wallstreetbets,Sounds about right
2021-04-18 10:39:14,wallstreetbets,"Eh, i lost 10k"
2021-04-18 10:46:02,wallstreetbets,My portfolio dropped from 250k to 85k since February while we are at ATH ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
2021-04-18 11:08:21,wallstreetbets,"I do around 30-40% of my portfolio in SPY and then I have a large chunk in the EV sector (without TSLA, as that‚Äôs now in the S&P). I use about 15-20% in options to try and increase my liquid capital. Most individuals have been bleeding money, while the past few months have been red for me it hasn‚Äôt been anything major due to my hedging."
2021-04-18 11:19:04,wallstreetbets,Congrats. This is the way tiger.
2021-04-18 11:20:52,wallstreetbets,AMD is probably the easiest call.
2021-04-18 11:47:08,wallstreetbets,AMD $100 strike lol. you belong here.
2021-04-18 11:57:32,wallstreetbets,"Indices were the betting instrument for record high margin, acting as gamma pins to psychological levels exceeding 4K s & p.. under the hood, whole system is unraveling.. bond spikes to 2% (again, that psychological #) were absolutely getting a 10% pullback.. if it continues it‚Äôs descent we have an undoing of reflation trade and deflationary environment.. hereby dragging indices down with if, whichever way we go, just a matter of when.. This message is brought to you by a man 100x levered $10M short SPY on 405-415 spy strikes"
2021-04-18 12:11:42,wallstreetbets,"AMD has never be in the three digits domain, and you bet not only on it reaches $100, but to just break even you need to it go above $107. Good luck on that."
2021-04-18 12:13:23,wallstreetbets,"Your mistake with AMD was going for 4/16 calls while earnings date is 4/27. Now imagine if AMD starts to rally next week as we approach ER?

Try not to go for very short maturities next time unless you have catalysts included in the life of your options (and even then, don't go for weeklies or 1M maturities)."
2021-04-18 12:33:46,wallstreetbets,"I lost money on near ITM calls too but my max loss was outrageous OTM calls. AMD 120c 3/19 bought in feb, PLTR 40c 5/21 bought in Feb."
2021-04-18 13:12:19,wallstreetbets,Yeah I had AMD 95c I bought back in feb. I was sure they would print but nope
2021-04-18 13:20:56,wallstreetbets,My growth portfolio has been red since the start of the year but my safe bets (extremely popular companies) portfolio is up fat (like 20% since I bought in last month). I have $50 in that portfolio. Now it is $65
2021-04-18 13:37:52,wallstreetbets,Just yolo otm 0dte SPY calls at open and you‚Äôll be back on track
2021-04-18 14:23:51,wallstreetbets,AMDüíØ
2021-04-18 15:47:16,wallstreetbets,yikes AMD.
2021-04-18 16:25:24,wallstreetbets,"$100 AMD calls expiring April? You‚Äôre too optimistic, my friend. Or just really bad at timing."
2021-04-18 16:40:47,wallstreetbets,"Those AMD calls alone would seem to indicate that your brain is the smoothest substance known to exist

Keep up the good work!"
2021-04-18 17:40:00,wallstreetbets,"I got out of AMD. Idk what the hot fuck is going on there but Jesus, what a mess"
2021-04-18 17:59:04,wallstreetbets,"Don't buy AMD calls. \*edit -  OTM calls.

2021-04-18 09:48:57,wallstreetbets,Every loss is an investment in your personal home education. Eventually you will get it back as long as your still learning.
2021-04-18 11:20:59,wallstreetbets,You needed AMD calls that expire after earnings come out this month. Preferably purchased when the stock was trading around $75. I bought the $90 leaps the past month. Hoping for a blowout ER.
2021-04-18 10:06:26,wallstreetbets,No GME in sight

2021-04-18 10:58:17,wallstreetbets,It's the shorts. They're buying and selling stocks at the same price to keep the price from moving up and then they buy a lot (or cover shorts) get everyone hyped up and dump everything. Hits stop loss triggers and people pull out because of fear. They're also doing it to prevent options from being ITM. What I've been doing is getting puts on stocks that I see the pattern. They're going to bring it down I might as well make money on it.
2021-04-18 10:58:50,wallstreetbets,when you know that loss is coming your sphincter tightens up and it hurts more.

2021-04-18 11:31:52,wallstreetbets,"Short term OTM options can bankrupt you.  Yes, a stock can move a ton in a short time, but if there was a good amount of information as to why, the price would reflect that.

In terms of earnings.  Much of this is factored in from people in the know, or a run-up to earnings.  This happened with NVIDIA this past summer when their earnings were great but the stock was stationary.  Another factor is stock manipulation from hedge funds and large funds.  They control the articles written about a stock and sway opinion even if you are trying to block it out, and their timed articles on important days should be another thing investigated besides their short selling.

Most of my big gainers have been year out call options on companies that were on the low end of their 52 week price.

Another thing that works is finding companies who are coming out with new products that are a few months away and take a gamble on year out options.  This works best if it is a small company with cheap OTM options."

2021-04-18 12:03:38,wallstreetbets,"Don't know what your overall strategy is, but, if a simple call/put is so pricey that your portfolio takes a real hit if it expires at $0, then you need to either (1) buy a spread, which dramatically reduces the cost and/or (2) be ready to sell earlier if it's not going your way, because it'll at least have some time value.

I had a long call on TSM that would've expired as worthless on Friday. My prediction about TSM was simply wrong. But it had been a spread, mitigating my loss, and I jumped out of it Tuesday, so I could still recover some of the value.

As an exercise, go back and at least see when you should've jumped out of each of those, keeping in mind that you don't know the future, but you can see when things aren't really unfolding as you predicted. There's no ""right"" answer here, it's whatever is appropriate for your portfolio / strategy / risk/reward balancing."

2021-04-18 12:47:07,wallstreetbets,"It's as if funds KNOW where the most pain is going to be and they somehow manage to trade either behind the scenes or openly to force the price to be to the penny. Now we all know places like RH and WeBull have records of what price hurts, and here is what they do:

Player 1 is looking to sell 100,000 shares. Player 2 is looking to BUY 100,000 shares. Most of the time, they do it in house and don't report it. They keep the vig between the two, and make about $150. If they want the price to go up and hurt the puts, they report some of the buys causing it to go up, and the sells they swap in a dark pool with other exchanges, or they take those sells and hang on to them without reporting them for 24 hours. They have enough cash to wait and deal with the swing. Then they can take all the sells, package them with shorts, and report them the next morning, causing it to crash. Plus, Melvin/RH can ALSO buy, knowing the stock is going up, and then tomorrow morning, sell theirs on the market making a profit, and then reporting all those other sales from yesterday, causing a giant sell off. Point is, if you are the middleman between the money and the market, you can hold the data and reporting for a period of time, handle trades internally, and manipulate like crazy."

2021-04-18 15:53:25,wallstreetbets,"Hello.

Since you have the capital to be approved for naked options, that means you have the capital to afford ITM calls...

Sure, there‚Äôs less wow factor (going from $0.50 to $50 for a whopping 9,900% gain), however you will accomplish two things:

-Lower chance of being OTM (and thus worthless) at expiry

-higher absolute price increases with each increase in the underlying."
2021-04-18 15:53:25,wallstreetbets,You are not alone if that makes you feel better.

Not sure about AMD and FCEL, but with FDX ~~and NKE~~, going ITM would've worked out better although I know that's not in the spirit of WSB.

EDIT: looking a little deeper at those tickers, I think ITM call options bought at least a month ago would've only worked for FDX. AMD and NKE would be better off with longer dated options/leaps. FCEL - no clue."

2021-04-18 11:01:20,wallstreetbets,"If you are going to buy and hold, you can at least use cash secured puts to buy your stocks and then sell covered calls once you get the stock. Or if you are really worried about it being called away you can sell call credit spreads to hedge against decreases in the underlying value of your stock, or double down with put credit spreads if you are going to be riding the stock price up.  


Options can easily compliment a buy and hold strategy, just not way OTM calls that would require a new all time high to happen in order to make money lol. Those are frequently called lottery tickets for a reason lol."

\* Thank you to whoever used the Reddit Care Resources (self-harm report?) on me, I feel a ray of hope now! It's just a start, but I feel optimistic enough in this moment to hope that my future infected bottle fight wound death will be painless! BTW the message you get starts off like ""When you're in the middle of something painful, it may feel like you don't have a lot of options. But whatever you're going through, you deserve help and there are people who are here for you."" I hope that everyone who needs to know this, does. There are always options, and remember what Jesus wrote on his myspace: the best options in life don't expire worthless."

2021-04-18 15:45:44,wallstreetbets,Why not both? I started trading two months ago and found out that best tool for beting is using high leverage. So IMO trading on different indices using x20 leverage or x5 leverage for boomer stocks is best risk/gain proposition there is. Also i dont need to spend days on DD. Nasdaq can move more than one percent a day and with x20 leverage that means more than 20% gain.
2021-04-18 16:07:16,wallstreetbets,He's not a boomer. At all.

I thought another market crash was imminent due to the election hysteria and a resurgence in covid shutdowns.(mainly in Europe). So far I have missed out on approx. $120k in gains. I regret not listening to conventional wisdom. On the positive side of things I wound up here and have been motivated to learn more about stocks and the market in general. Not all bad."

2021-04-18 10:28:02,wallstreetbets,"Agreed.

Housing market will crash I think


I bought my home in Feb 2020, it's now worth 100k more in less then a year and frankly my town isn't the best in central New Jersey lol"
2021-04-18 11:38:42,wallstreetbets,"I think the interest rate going up a fraction of a percent won‚Äôt have an effect. The costs associated with building a home are the biggest factor in not being able to deliver the supply needed to stabilize home pricing. 
Interest rates are historically low. It‚Äôs important to understand how crazy cheap money is relative to 10+ years ago."
2021-04-18 11:34:57,wallstreetbets,There is a pretty large number of people that would be pretty thrilled if there was a housing market crash.

Edit:  Built up a 40,000 share position in HD during the decade of the late 90's to 2007/8  when fucking Bob (ex GE manager) Nardelli was running it. For ten years the thing didn't do shit.  I finally got back to even in the low $40's and sold it all.  Now?  40,000 X $300 = $12 million not counting dividends.

Edit 2:  And of course they paid him $250 million to leave HD for Chrysler which he promptly ran into the ground too."

Disclaimer: I'm looking at picking up XL at $5-6

However, you're aware of the lawsuit Brager Eagel & Squire have against XL Fleets right?

A tldr: Lied about client base, lied about cost-benefit savings of their product, lack staff & supply chain to deliver on their promises.

Not sure how legitimate this is as they appear to have recurring business in this field, currently they've also filed a suit against AstraZeneca, not sure how they're going to deal with this given they have < 10 staff apparently.


>The complaint, filed on March 8, 2021, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company‚Äôs business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that XL Fleet‚Äôs salespeople were pressured to inflate their sales pipelines to boost the Company‚Äôs reported sales and backlog; (2) that at least 18 of the 33 customers that XL featured were inactive and had not placed an order since 2019; (3) that XL‚Äôs technology had been materially overstated and offered only 5% to 10% of fleet savings; (4) that XL lacks the supply chain and engineers to roll out new products on the announced timelines; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, defendants‚Äô positive statements about the Company‚Äôs business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Invest in yourself before real-estate. The quickest way to make money without starting with a bunch of it is by snagging a higher-paying job. Look into local community/tech schools. They usually have some type of 1-2 year program that will put you on the right track to a decent career. Even if it's not what you want to do forever it can jump start your earnings and if you keep your standard of living the same for a couple years you can accumulate a nice chunk of capital to pivot to something else."

Still using risk-based margin portfolio, but moved to 20-26x leverage from 8-12x before. I still don't recommend ANYONE doing this, you have to have decent starting capital (I started with 109k) and allocate time (you cannot do this and have a day job that overlaps with the market trading hours).

My strategy is currently diversifying (bought into SpaceX and Stripe secondaries) and preparing to do an OTC direct listing in US and Canada. I believe it is important to have a long investment horizon, and mine is 5-10y at the moment.

Things that appeared to help:

1. develop and apply a strong understanding of macro-conditions
2. explore and become comfortable with the broker risk model
3. manage portfolio in real-time

These days I probably make only 3-5 trades in a regular session, with bursts of activity if rebalancing is needed or a rally/drop took place in one of my underlyings. Sharpe (1-year) is 1.67

I am still long ""misunderstood"" equities and short cash and volatility. And I owe a big thank you to Reddit for making me think about this in 2019. It's a nice journey.

2021-04-18 13:09:17,wallstreetbets,"I'm here late enough that even if you answer truthfully no one will notice, but...

Is this Elon?"
2021-04-18 09:52:48,wallstreetbets,What platform/site do you use to buy spacex
2021-04-18 13:25:09,wallstreetbets,21x margin? That some high personal risk tolerance
2021-04-18 16:14:15,wallstreetbets,"Feeling real good about my returns NOT using 21x leverage based on this, lol"
2021-04-18 19:12:52,wallstreetbets,26x leverage? You‚Äôve surpassed u/controlthenarrative‚Äôs personal risk tolerance by 1!
2021-04-18 08:26:01,wallstreetbets,"and they should.. I enjoy the high IV environment we are trading in and have a good understanding of the federal policies going into 2024, but ultimately the volatility could calm down and I want to get exposure into what is coming down the line (space, digital currency, life sciences)"
2021-04-18 09:58:38,wallstreetbets,More like the right connections. My friends invested through me.

2021-04-18 09:28:26,wallstreetbets,"Buffet uses a ton of margin, he just calls it float from his insurance company"
2021-04-18 07:30:05,wallstreetbets,"more like ""rich investors don't need it"""
2021-04-18 08:24:18,wallstreetbets,my thoughts exactly
2021-04-18 09:17:31,wallstreetbets,I actually lost some 300k on $GME (my mistake though nobody else to blame)
2021-04-18 08:57:53,wallstreetbets,"TIMS margin is a function of perceived risk. If you ‚Äúreduce‚Äù risk (aka hedge) within the stress test conditions used by the broker and the OCC, you can borrow more hence leverage up."
2021-04-18 09:11:08,wallstreetbets, Me walking into the bank: ‚ÄúI would like 21x money please.‚Äù
2021-04-18 09:59:19,wallstreetbets,My words exactly at every market open lol
2021-04-18 10:19:51,wallstreetbets,"Out of curiosity, what brought ***you*** here (as in wsb)? I've seen an interesting uptick in the amount of people on PM leveraged 8-24x out.

Maybe I was too busy laughing at mattress memes pre-gme im/explosion to notice, but I'm used to people blowing up accounts ""the old fashioned way"" of 4x-ing their $43k into $0."

No, you peasant."
2021-04-18 09:59:03,wallstreetbets,He had to blow some old dude to get them
2021-04-18 08:16:37,wallstreetbets,"I too, would like to know this"

2021-04-18 09:37:52,wallstreetbets,Will sure do but fact is I have been doing this for a good while so you‚Äôre better keeping an eye on the obituaries as well in case dying of old age happens first.
2021-04-18 11:04:28,wallstreetbets,"I was talking about this with a friend that underwrites loans for real estate debt funds.  The big consequence of 2007-2008 was very tight regulation on traditional banks, stress-testing, reserve requirements, etc. to prevent it happening again.

This is why there has been an explosion of debt funds, family offices, etc. that are way less regulated and subject to FAR greater risk.  Combine that with, currently indefinite faucet of easy money on full strength, and you have your next crisis my friends.


Retail whales and even some small-time 200-300k retail investors are becoming highly levered.  It won't be as bad as 2007-2008 but this is still going to fucking hurt."
2021-04-18 11:45:02,wallstreetbets,It's only 20x leverage? How bad could it be?
2021-04-18 10:36:48,wallstreetbets,Portfolio components got answered earlier ($TSLA is largest). I sell a lot of options for hedging. I am holding overnight and have contracts expiring as far as 2022 at the moment.

2021-04-18 13:47:13,wallstreetbets,"Yup I‚Äôm a fraud lol

Edit: came back to like your comment above. Healthy doubt and looking for ulterior motive are signs of critical thinking."

I personally don't do it (there's an old Buffet quote about leverage I don't want to try to recall exactly) but anybody would give me 30 if I asked."
2021-04-18 09:01:12,wallstreetbets,"Good question - I am short vol along the term, so weighted vega works for me. Apologies for being bad at explaining this - think of it simplistically that I am more inclined to collect premium from selling options than pay it, hence ‚Äúshort vol‚Äù but it is nuanced by the weighted vega aspect of it (think calendars if you start researching it)"
2021-04-18 09:42:17,wallstreetbets,If you mean old and wreckless you are getting there with little chance of failure
2021-04-18 13:30:04,wallstreetbets,Good enough for me
2021-04-18 14:17:03,wallstreetbets,"Risk tolerance, ability to tolerate pain, conviction. You are right, psychology is very important. I don‚Äôt know anyone else doing this but haven‚Äôt exactly been spending any amount of time asking around either. I cannot be the outlier lasting so long, more likely I am still emotional enough to come and answer questions here (I realised after a while that my ego trips are now choices of different destinations than social media)."
2021-04-18 08:24:05,wallstreetbets,"not sure what you mean by 80/20. I deal with all the positions around an underlying (say $TSLA, my fav trade) as a single super-position (long stock and long/short puts and calls). The ""hedge"" is in the response curve of the super-position to changes in the underlying price and implied volatility."

2021-04-18 14:42:18,wallstreetbets,"Hm... H.8 and Daily Treasury Statement are a good start. Go for the source and work your way to conclusions from first principles, not others‚Äô opinions. 
Get in touch with active traders and participate in discussions at the right level (broker risk model is boring, unlike YOLOs)"
2021-04-18 09:09:37,wallstreetbets,Will you teach me your best strategy to bankrupt my account using margin? The wife is about to take half in the divorce so I might as well yolo to 2x or 0.

2021-04-18 11:43:46,wallstreetbets,Well all these irresponsible people who leverage their money not knowing what they are doing sure have friends who invite them to spend some of that high risk money by diversifying to other investments lol

2021-04-18 14:54:15,wallstreetbets,One of my favourite quotes from the movie
2021-04-18 15:11:27,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt know much about that
What I was thinking of doing was just list on the OTC markets"
2021-04-18 15:19:25,wallstreetbets,50-60 in 2022 maybe
2021-04-18 17:16:26,wallstreetbets,"Haha I consider myself a noob - started trading options seriosuly in 2019, does not feel that far back. Protect your capital, avoid unexpected margin calls. Profits and losses mean little to me, most important is to stay in the game. Not sure if that helps, but I believe it is the most important thing at this time."
2021-04-18 14:27:11,wallstreetbets,"Nope, but I learned a lot from him. True story, was short $TSLA until May 2020 and losing a bit of money on that. Switched sides, been doing ‚Äúbetter‚Äù since lol"
2021-04-18 14:25:10,wallstreetbets,"21x leverage. Pay attention. It‚Äôs just a number. But yes, my margin requirements are low - not because of ‚Äúmagical‚Äù leverage but because of risk offsetting (hedging or balancing positions)"
2021-04-18 16:43:16,wallstreetbets,"See some comments here... leverage is not risk. Happy to hear you have good results.
You can think that in CPM the margin requirements are the ‚Äúprice‚Äù of risk (the metaphor works for a snapshot image of risk within stress test limits, you are still responsible for long tail)"
2021-04-18 08:30:20,wallstreetbets,I drove down Crenshaw and saw the SpaceX HQ. Same thing.
2021-04-18 10:41:22,wallstreetbets,Are you old enough to remember when Pan Am tried space tourism in the 60s?
2021-04-18 10:10:13,wallstreetbets,I think I just heard SpaceX just got a contract to take us back to the moon? Is that true / is that a reason why you got into them?
2021-04-18 15:25:27,wallstreetbets,"Can you recommend resources in learning how to find/understand fed policies, and get that macro understanding of the market?"

2021-04-18 16:42:58,wallstreetbets,"What‚Äôs a minimum investment look like for ‚Äúfriends that invest through connections‚Äù type scenarios?

This is purely to paint a picture of what type of money I need to be investing if I‚Äôm ever in the position. I ask minimum amount, primarily to gauge where I‚Äôm at in relation to the bar."
2021-04-18 15:03:57,wallstreetbets,"Nope, that‚Äôs ‚Äúbuying power‚Äù calculated by the broker at 15% Margin Requirements (would probably apply to $SPY or $TLT but not much else). Excess liq is around 1mn"
2021-04-18 14:39:24,wallstreetbets,"Ya I remembered what I read about a capital limit to invest in spacex before I zoomed in, this guy gets it on for sure."
2021-04-18 14:39:58,wallstreetbets,What makes it private then ?
2021-04-18 10:59:05,wallstreetbets,"My definitions of a 'retirement plan' and 'hedging against risk' are equal to having a ""side bet in XLM"" and ""buying shares of AAPL"" respectively. 
  
So you must be doing something right."
2021-04-18 17:19:58,wallstreetbets,Did you invest in PE for these or through one of these platforms like equityzen?
2021-04-18 10:21:53,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but the key differences are that float isn‚Äôt subject to margin call, and his insurance companies underwrite profitably, so the ‚Äúmargin interest‚Äù is effectively a negative rate."
2021-04-18 12:50:53,wallstreetbets,"I think he's legitimately a good investor but also if you look at the history from partnerships to the insurance company a ton of his personal wealth comes from using other people's money. So yeah, if that's who the quote is from, he's got to be referring to a very specific kind of margin investing where you can get margin called"
2021-04-18 09:58:05,wallstreetbets,Yup

2021-04-18 14:35:53,wallstreetbets,Care to share how you lost it?
2021-04-18 11:33:32,wallstreetbets,Funny you understand this is irresponsible but this is exactly what the big boys do. ‚ÄúHedge‚Äù then lever up. Except they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wrong since it‚Äôs mathematically correct. Just not practically. Insanity.

2021-04-18 10:30:05,wallstreetbets,"Back in 2019 I posted some theses in WSB (mostly shorting junk bonds stuff). I used to have 3-4 plays a year and was pretty public about them (Palantir, SPACs, Nelnet) and getting feedback and debate is the best way to refine your plan.
Figured out how to 4-6x a long time ago. Doing it hedged and scaling (my stretch test was 28x I think) is different - you learn about liquidity and counterparty risk the hard way.

2021-04-18 12:16:13,wallstreetbets,"I saw the tesla position mentioned. So you are stock picking and then hedging with options. I used to trade 100x hedged while licensed but I wouldn't hold overnight.  Basically, retired now but I might get back into it if I can wake up early enough for the opening bell."

2021-04-18 09:29:33,wallstreetbets,"Ah yeah, that makes sense. 

Something to consider for sure, although I'm definitely gonna be waiting for an entry since I think VIX has room to run at least in the short to medium term given how crap liquidity in the overall market has been lately.

Thanks for answering :)"
2021-04-18 09:33:06,wallstreetbets,What percentage do you hedge in relation to your options. How does this help with the Vega? Are they constantly expiring hedges as you approach your strike date? This seems like it could go tits up fast.
2021-04-18 09:47:09,wallstreetbets,"Nah I'm in the same boat.   
Trying to figure this all out.   
You definitely seem like you haven a much better understanding of the markets than I do; but I'm learning...

I'm about where you were when you started as far as capital is concerned but I'm lacking on how to use it properly..
Where did you learn the ropes?"
2021-04-18 09:37:43,wallstreetbets,Can you explain in details layman style? Sounds very pro but I am an ape so don‚Äôt understand what you are saying.

2021-04-18 17:00:04,wallstreetbets,what broker offers it?
2021-04-18 14:35:23,wallstreetbets,Oh thank you. So I can't basically damn
2021-04-18 15:43:49,wallstreetbets,"Not looking for a rebuttal, but personally I have a hard time believing this thing can get to 1T market cap in the same ballparks of much more diversified companies like MSFT, APPL, AMZN.

2021-04-18 10:10:36,wallstreetbets,"The NASA deal is tiny in the big scheme of things, but the PR value huge, just like you described. Let‚Äôs see - there‚Äôs a lot of hassle to make these investments so you really have to see big returns to justify them."

2021-04-18 17:22:01,wallstreetbets,Not through platforms. I invest alongside institutional investors - wealth managers on behalf of their clients for example. In Palantir I know anecdotally we had a George Soros fund on the same block.
2021-04-18 10:28:01,wallstreetbets,"Accurate, but the float is subject to needing to be paid out (which can also happen suddenly if a massive event happens at the same time as a market crash brought on by a disaster causing insurance loses). It‚Äôs mostly just really disingenuous to say Buffet doesn‚Äôt use margin, when he really just uses types of margin that most of us can‚Äôt get at"
2021-04-18 17:30:51,wallstreetbets,He can watch a stock go to $0.01 without being forced out of the trade for a loss. And he doesn't pay interest on his investments. But it would all be pointless if he didn't pick the best stocks year after year. I imagine he finds it all a little boring.
2021-04-18 13:30:05,wallstreetbets,I know why you're laughing and it's not for the reasons others are....
2021-04-18 10:01:23,wallstreetbets,"Nope, I have clear symptoms and coming here feels like going on vacation from my regular routine."
2021-04-18 14:46:57,wallstreetbets,"Early (before the first big spike) I wrote some short straddles (100 lot) at 55 or 75, few weeks out. It‚Äôs a bit of a blur but when it started moving up I rolled, then it was coming down and I closed a leg being greedy and before I closed the other it moved up. I could have rolled if not for the initial margin req constrain - got uncomfortable with the loss level and closed. Needless to say, had I not messed the original trade or let emotion have a say, it would have been manageable. I made a good chunk back with stock and options a few days later, and I am out now - but historically it‚Äôs my biggest single trade loss. On the other hand, I am happy for whoever bought my calls - I deserved what happened to me."
2021-04-18 11:38:20,wallstreetbets,"I just don‚Äôt suggest anyone does this. There‚Äôs secret sauce and elbow grease to it, but most people wouldn‚Äôt do the work anyway."
2021-04-18 10:12:11,wallstreetbets,"Some of the info is public (+/-30% spot price, +/-300% volatility change) but there are hidden factors (proprietary risk model) they won‚Äôt tell you (meaning a simple test using TIMS will not match IBKR margin requirements in edge cases)"

2021-04-18 09:36:13,wallstreetbets,"Not sure what you mean by percentage to hedge - you might be thinking delta hedging.
I think in terms of risk - if you look at the chart, plotting SPX on the X axis and percentage changes from spot, the PnL can move drastically (there are two more curves to account for sensitivity to changes in volatility but they make little sense out of hours).
My hedges get rolled when needed, not expire."
2021-04-18 09:52:41,wallstreetbets,I am a practitioner first - so learn by doing. Collected a bunch of good people on WhatsApp as well. But primarily doing something every day gives you some advantage.

Same here - only that instead of shorting stocks (I am not good at that, see Melvin) I am short something else - cash and volatility."

2021-04-18 12:28:54,wallstreetbets,How much capital would you need to get involved in something like this? What's the process like? I know you said it's a headache but if you could do a short explanation I would appreciate it.
2021-04-18 12:46:12,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs min buy?  I‚Äôm an accredited investor by definition.
2021-04-18 13:17:02,wallstreetbets,"You show me a paystub I come work for you. But forreal if it‚Äôs a hassle; how much is the buyin. I‚Äôm not a financial ape; but I do like space x and the things it represent. Now what are the laws in regarding such as if you were to collect funds from here from a bunch of apes into one giant deposit and then invest that through you in space x on our behalf? I am sure there will need to be some filings etc as now your taking private money and investing on our behalf but we are deciding where it goes (atm space x) payouts are based on percentage put in of course. Wouldn‚Äôt be to hard to create a private account only statement system showing x in and x out and percentages. Technically speaking it‚Äôs just a website that will allow accounts that have access to view the balance and payouts; database driven. I dunno the start of super stonk fund? Investing in growth of life and human kind and not the evil fund profiting off the backs of the working every day person

Because one would assume yes 1000.00 buyin is crap but if you got like 10k users that‚Äôs a lot of buying power; quantity works in numbers too i mean if the whole gme thing showed us anything."
2021-04-18 11:47:40,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm interested. In learning about the process at least
2021-04-18 11:06:08,wallstreetbets,"I would love to but I am FAR too small time for that to be viable for me at the minute (as in they would laugh me off).

2021-04-18 14:49:22,wallstreetbets,"IB doesn't give out margins like this, and definitely NOT 21x. I don't give a fuck if you are on portfolio margin or not. The only way to get this number is to game the leverage number, which doesn't capture delta, just notionals, meaning at the end of the day your leverage means jack shit if your delta is tiny. 

Show us your positions so we can all see how full of shit you are. I'm expecting a bunch of delta neutral positions / fully hedged positions"

2021-04-18 17:49:08,wallstreetbets,"True - being able to commit and transfer promptly makes these hard. You need to do due diligence BEFORE the block appears, on both the seller and the company."

2021-04-18 13:10:32,wallstreetbets,"You have to be an accredited or qualified investor to participate in all these secondary markets. It's not for the poors. Mostly because chances of losing all your money is insanely high, and a lot gets eaten up by fees to begin with. Additionally, min investment is usually 100k and more often 500k."
2021-04-18 14:51:38,wallstreetbets,I showed you a portfolio response curve and told you what to google to understand it lol
2021-04-18 17:52:36,wallstreetbets,Yeah I‚Äôm holding about 40k cash in my brokerage position and have several positions I can liquidate quickly if the opportunity for spaceX pops up again. Although given the recent share prices on the private exchanges 50k won‚Äôt even get you 150 shares
2021-04-18 14:25:03,wallstreetbets,"I'm accredited by definition, but haven't ever bothered to look into any benefits it would get me in terms of investing.  I looked online and it's not like you get a certificate saying you're accredited, rather the fund you're trying to invest in has to do the due diligence themselves that you're not some poor and can deal with the increased risk.  

Is this right?  So say i wanted to invest in SpaceX, I just go up to some fund and be like ""yo, I got $500k wanna drop, take my word for it or look at my statements, can you let me in?"""
2021-04-18 15:00:49,wallstreetbets,"Ya keep pretending to be not full of shit telling me to google big words doesn't mean jack shit to what you are claiming. 

""Bro you are just not getting it""

What does your portfolio response curve show? It shows that you are hedged. That's it, doesn't show your true leverage. You can buy straddles and it'll look like this.

Your actual leverage isn't anywhere close to 21."

2021-04-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CBOE VIX Options: Maybe Overdo for a Sharp Move Higher Hey, guys. I decided to bring out the ol' Excel to get some data on the SPY over the last 12-months to measure the money flow, and I found something super interesting.

Money flow is essentially the inflow and outflow of money coming into a particular company, asset class, or security. It's a good way of measuring market participation. Higher market participation in bullish times often takes equities to new highs, but in bearish times it becomes a drag on equity prices. When money flow oscillates in tighter intervals, we tend to see more spikes in volatility rather than when it oscillates slightly or not at all.

Let us take a lot at the SPY and the charts representing it. We have the price index, the total flows, the inflow(+) and outflow (-), and the net flow charts. Taking all of this information together, you may see where I come to the conclusion of why the market is overdue for a little more volatility, which means that VIX options are in play for the next few weeks most likely.

[This is the price index of the SPY on a per day basis over a 12-month period. We have reaching higher highs in the recent weeks while volatility has been dropping. This is a classic bearish sign for the market. Not to say that we will see a correction by any means, just a little bit more volatility, I think. Like I said, high volatility in a bull market is good. In a bear market, not so much.](https://preview.redd.it/hbfiz3fwcut61.png?width=2475&format=png&auto=webp&s=4910cea6eea6159d41c54f078e49d8e623051df6)

[This  is the total flows on a per day basis over the same period of time. As you can see, volatility dropped in the most recent weeks in comparison to those before and the SPY went up. Reiterating: it's a bearish signal based on historical measurements. But expecting volatility is not the same as saying I'm a bear. I'm just seeing perhaps more swings in the weeks to come to both the downside and the upside. If we're in bullish mindset, the price will trend up. If bears take over, hold on to your hats.](https://preview.redd.it/bwqkuld1dut61.png?width=2486&format=png&auto=webp&s=a093c106910abe22916074072cb7df322f8dff17)

[This is the inflow\/outflow chart over the same period of time. Notice the higher frequency on the left-side of the chart vs the right-side. This tells me that there is higher market activity as larger volumes of inflows and outflows are happening in tighter spreads, thus giving the \\""clustered\\"" effect. As we look towards the right-side of the graph, we see a lower frequency as inflow and outflow activity isn't so active and the spreads look \\""looser.\\"" The money flow frequency can change at any moment but just be aware that the frequency starts going higher because of an event that forces it. Often that event happens after a low frequency environment. We are currently in a low frequency environment.](https://preview.redd.it/gy3vyq0idut61.png?width=2466&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbca5977189fdc9e7e6e30d1d3e55396b6a19c85)

[This graph represents the total net flows per month. The peaks \(i.e. turning points\) show where the CBOE Volatility Index \(VIX\) has stabilized. Since the last spike in the VIX around late January\/early February, we haven't seen the VIX consolidate at a bottom. The data for April is only partially available because the month isn't complete, so do not take the line upward following the last turning point as a definite sign of stabilization. However, if we can assume that the final line going upward will average the current rate of return that is already there, then we may be due for a stabilization test soon.](https://preview.redd.it/v4e4xp2ceut61.png?width=2173&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d4c0a2c3b3b7ab1c7426e42db700438c644f425)

You can see the correlations between the VIX stabilization and the net flow peaks around the period by comparing the chart above with the one below.

https://preview.redd.it/oc2wlpcbfut61.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=f599b35562d2b4494e138b98de2358ea5de66052

Based on this argument, I think we may start seeing the VIX consolidate at around this level. We're in a low frequency environment, the perfect spot for when high frequency starts to kick in. After a test of stabilization, we either see a sharp move upwards or the continuation of a slow decay before it gets retested again. Are we at a place of consolidation, or are we quickly approaching one? I don't know for certain, but I like to follow the money.

&#x200B;

Edit: Title: meant to say ""overdue."" It's late."
2021-04-18 01:59:53,wallstreetbets,"Solid DD, I‚Äôve been eyeing the VIX for a few other glaring reasons.  Thanks for the confirmation bias,  I‚Äôll pick up some 20Cs for .20c üòâ"
2021-04-18 02:40:42,wallstreetbets,"I have been waiting for VIX to hit $15, but it seems like a lot of investors are antsy. Bonds selloff recently raised cash for those who sold. Why? Banks offered huge bond sales to raise cash. Why? London did not hide that it intended to push gold spot price up last week, but the bond to gold trade to shift cash reserve positions is not appropriate for this recovery environment. Why? Was it to pad the value to take a little edge off of a coming massive fall? Warren Buffet exited bank positions leading into a recovery, which is another strange move to raise cash. Why?

All of this tells me that big money is preparing large cash positions to support future buys. A fair case for the banks is that they need to support higher housing costs for mortgages, but that doesn't feel right to me. Banks could draw more debt from FedRes, but they chose to raise cash through traditional means. Banks also traditionally sell gold and silver, preferably near the top to front run other big sellers. I expect this to happen, and with the debt competition between banks and investment firms, and due to the dynamics of recent sovereign challenges, I expect fierce gold sells to plunge gold spot price. All of this leads me to believe that coming is a major shift of investment capital out of commodity heavy exchanges and into storefront & webmarket exchanges.

My bet is that VIX is about to double, so FOMO is adding anxiety daily.

I am a novice individual investor who makes awful investment decisions that leads me to ruin, and I am not qualified to give advice about investments, finance, or anything."

2021-04-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What does today's San Felipe 250 mean for $RIDE short term? Who bought 4/23 puts last week?

For those following today's race in Baja in which Lordstown Motors entered a souped up version of their EV truck ""Endurance,"" hopefully you're already trying to figure out what to do with your positions Monday at open. For those who didn't follow the race,  despite what Lordstown released on Facebook and Twitter, it really can't be viewed as anything other than a disaster. 

The truck's battery gave out at mile 40, at which point the driver (who is apparently a janitor or security guard at LM) veered a mile off course so they could recharge. The truck sat not moving for around two hours before taking the wrong route to get back on course and finally deciding to just turn around and drive back to the start via the highway. 

Honestly, that's not the worst part.  Lordstown posted a video to Instagram showing the truck in action during the race.  It was *ahem* ...underwhelming. My 68 year old mother would have passed them on the shoulder in her 10 year old Chevy Malibu and flipped them the bird for driving like a bitch. One of the biggest concerns many have had about this truck is that having the motors in the wheel hubs versus mounted to the body would cause serious issues on bumpy terrain and lead to the motors being rendered inoperable when you hit a pothole. The video of them driving Miss Daisy though the Baja desert did not assuage these fears for me.  Perhaps it did for others. Perhaps I'm overreacting. 

I had hoped to see them go balls to the wall.  Announce their presence with aplomb and say ""Here we are, America! Come get yours off the line in September!"" At least then if it broke down (like literally 50% of the entrants in this race), you could at least say ""Hey, we went for it.  We've got some things to work on before next year's race, but the truck is still a winner."" Instead, they drove it like a 90 year old who is driving for the first time in their life five minutes after smoking their first fatty. And they still broke down 40 miles into the 250 mile race. Really disappointing. 

So, positions. 

200 shares @ 11.95 average that I expect to lose value as I will continue to hold long term. 

15 4/23C $13
25 4/23C $12
25 4/23C $10
10 4/23P $8 

The options were stupid and overly optimistic, but I bought them as lottery tickets hoping that Lordstown would push the truck to the limits today.  They didn't. 

My only source of hope right now is that this market makes no sense.  Maybe they'll shake this off and spike Monday. Should have joined the theta gang and sold some covered calls of my shares.

Edit: more embarrassment.  The other EV in the race,  lovingly nicknamed ""the shitbox,"" which is nothing more than an old 4runner mated with a damn Nissan Leaf is still going strong and on pace to finish under the time limit."
2021-04-17 22:13:14,wallstreetbets,Curious to thoughts as well. I followed this heavily and hate management‚Äôs response. They did say hub motors performed well today. But who knows at this point.
2021-04-17 22:21:18,wallstreetbets,"More than half of purpose built vehicles in this race don't finish. I sort of doubt they'll close the doors.

Would have been an incredible catalyst if they had finished tho"
2021-04-18 10:06:20,wallstreetbets,This is exactly why I bought LEAPs for Jan23 and holding like it's stock. Gonna buy the dip too and average down on same calls. Maybe give them my engineering services on a discount for stock options. I'll be greedy this time while you're fearful and we'll see how it turns out.

Saw what I wanted to see. Not surprised that the battery was drained at mile 40. Driving through sand takes a great amount of energy. I'm still riding with Lordstown.

Buying the dip ‚úÖ holding to September or beyond.

Edited out some opinions that I don't hold anymore. I believe that their reasoning for pulling out of the race was justified. Bullish for the next few months."
2021-04-18 04:33:22,wallstreetbets,"I think you‚Äôre overreacting on a couple things. 1) the video of them driving was at a decent speed? They were going over a severe bump. Didn‚Äôt look like they should send it flying. 2) they didn‚Äôt break down. The car was ‚Äúrunning‚Äù (fans and some movement) for three hours before it started, and then the battery died at mile 40 (obviously a huge miscalculation on their part). Mechanically it didn‚Äôt break down. 
  
The concern is that this is a huge PR misstep. This shows that leaderships unwavering confidence does not mean the things they say are actually true."
2021-04-18 00:42:42,wallstreetbets,Yeah calls are probably dead but I still think this whole entrance into Baja racing was pretty ballsy. I just hope they have a solid manufacturing plan in place that is better than their race planning.
2021-04-18 00:47:02,wallstreetbets,"Lordstown performed as expected. A virgin team with an untested truck didn't finish and had technical and navigation issues. 

Anybody that follows this racing is not shocked. Anybody else is going to find exactly what they wanna see in the results. Tesla fans are going to say it's the end of hub motors and how a Tesla would have done better, ICE fans are going to claim that this proves EV is not an option, Lordstown fans are going to say it's the start of something great but have some teething issues to work through. Lordstown showed up, where was Tesla or the Hummer EV? So short term this only reinforces what they already believed.  Only thing that would have changed this is a win. 

Long term one race means even less.  I mean without Googling it where did the Ford Bronco R finish in the BAJA 1000 in 2019? It was a total disaster. And people are still excited and they still sell every one that they can build. 

Next short Score race is the Baja 400 in September, Best in the Desert has a few shorter races starting in August. If they enter those and DNF that's when you start to worry.

If it ends in a fireball and a pile of twisted wreckage, good; that would at least generate some excitement and allow them to give it a positive spin.

2021-04-17 23:19:26,wallstreetbets,They partnered with brenthel to build the truck. Those guys build top notch Baja trucks. Seems like a great place to start and really sounds like they were serious. To do that and then not bring in a pro driver was a huge mistake.

There was a company in Calgary Canada that sold conversion kits to turn your car electric. They had a Ford ranger kit that came complete with batteries and controller etc for 5grand usd. Once these ev companies emerged poof... the company doesn't exist anymore and I can't find any conversion kits online.

2021-04-17 22:58:17,wallstreetbets,"*THIS*

More than half don't finish.  (I think it's closer to 33% finish)

If they didn't finish that would have been one thing if they really went all out and had a glorious failure.  This is also what we were expecting after the hype to the event.  (E.g. them really pushing the truck)

Instead, they ran super conservatively and STILL broke down. 

This right here is going to tank the stock.  Going ""balls to the walls"" from the start and breaking would have been a far different reaction, especially if they played it off correctly.  

And then of course, their post-failure responses have been crappy as well.  

Expect the stock to get the shit beat out of it on Monday.  

I do have some stock so I'm going to try and not look at it.  My calls are out until November so they have some time to recover.  

The absolute worst part is that Tony Stark built the other EV in a cave .... with scraps .... and it is going to finish.

Remind me... How many rockets has Daddy Elon blown up so far? Or NASA in the 60's?"

What an utter failure."
2021-04-17 23:33:16,wallstreetbets,"Sure, first time failures, and failure in general, is a reality of life. NASA still blew up a rocket in the 90s, too. 

But if you're trying to ""mass"" produce cars... Well then you should really have your prototype locked down and ready to go before figuring out how to make sales, which it definitely seems like sales are their focus.

Even if it was an issue with sitting on a tarmac before the race started (lol) what's going to happen to your everyday drivers when they're stuck waiting in traffic because of an accident?"

I'm with you that I was expecting more than what we saw; however, there are other companies *cough* NKLA *cough* that have ZERO and even faked a truck by having it roll down a hill.  

That is a scam.

These guys (RIDE) could fail, but I am seeing them making good faith efforts to move forward.  

P.S.  Your user name checks out."
2021-04-18 01:05:53,wallstreetbets,It was a questionable decision to enter the race in the first place.  They are not manufacturing an off road truck. They chose to use an inexperienced driver.  If they had finished would the positive have outweighed the risk?

Point is unless it‚Äôs a massive conspiracy, it‚Äôs not a scam. Real humans go to work in a real factory and it‚Äôs fucking massive."
2021-04-18 01:10:45,wallstreetbets,I liked the decision.  But if you are going to enter the race...*race.* Show customers what you have. I didn't expect them to win or even finish.  I did expect them to drive the truck like they were trying to show what it is made of though. Don't drive like you're piloting the Mars Rover and still have the vehicle fail.
2021-04-18 02:03:26,wallstreetbets,"I am a bear on RIDE (closed my positions last week, so no financial interest in seeing them go down anymore) and I agree that entering this race was a very questionable move. If they did well, well it is a heavily customized truck that has little bearing on production. If it does poorly, as it did, it makes them look like clowns. I guess if it did well, you have an argument that in-wheel motors might work out, but still not sure the smartness of this move."

2021-04-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLOV degenerates be careful Sigh... be careful CLOV degenerates. This high short interest stuff has already been debunked it looks like. The high short interest shown was a mistake by Factset and the short% of float is way way lower. Short interest is actually only about 35% of float, which is moderately high but not anywhere remotely close to the 145% being spread around.

1. Institutional shares like Vanguard that are counted in the post are freely tradable and are never deducted from a float calculation.
2. Clover‚Äôs publicly traded equity are Class A shares. Clover‚Äôs CEO only holds Class B shares. The screenshot shows that FactSet accidentally thought CEO Garipalli‚Äôs 83 million Class B shares were Class A shares. They were not, but because of the mistake FactSet subtracted them from the calculation of Class A float, which led to the mistakenly low number.

In other words, the screenshot of the ‚Äúevidence‚Äù actually debunks this thesis.

There are about 109.8 million shares in the free float, and FactSet, Bloomberg, and Reuters are now all in agreement on that. But when FactSet subtracted 83 million from that by mistake it made it look like the float was only \~27 million (109.8 - 83) which made it look like the short interest as a % of float was massive.

FactSet corrected their numbers today. S3 Partners (which was cited in media and relied on FactSet) will likely correct next, then the handful of media articles that cited S3 (and indirectly FactSet) will probably correct as well.

There are actually a ton of shares available to short (30 million) according to IHS Markit, another short data provider. The cost to borrow is cheap at about 1.5-2%. None of this is consistent with a squeeze scenario.

Want to find high short interest names like everyone else but this is just not the one.

EDIT: S3 has now corrected their short interest based on the incorrect input from Factset, their SI% of float number has changed to 36.97% [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1384112959329247236](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1384112959329247236)

EDIT 2: IPO Edge release covers S3's change of short interest calculation over the weekend [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chamath-backed-clover-health-apparent-172941952.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chamath-backed-clover-health-apparent-172941952.html)"

Even accepting that 35% is the correct number, that's more than enough for a short squeeze. The bigger danger for shorts is the massive gamma squeeze that's pending if this thing goes over $10. That option chain is incredibly loaded. Amc squeezed on less while tripling the number of outstanding shares. It's all about whether retard strength or FUD is greater in the short term."

CLOV is in legitimate trouble as a company.  It's impacted chamaths rreputation.  I dont own this but I do own sofi, shares and leaps, where I'm getting murdered because of the ownership and spac connection to CLOV.  

Keep in mind, two opposite opinions on a stock can be reasonable.  The new guys who don't have room in their brains for dissenting opinions can be suspicious of whatever they want but it amounts to ad hominem.  Do you disagree with the content or do you dislike that he is being critical of your thesis?

2021-04-18 15:02:19,wallstreetbets,That is not short intrest. That is short VOLUME two completely different things and short volume is useless becuase 98% of the time MMs short stocks when the demand is going up to keep up the supply and immediately cover within a few seconds or even milliseconds. Also Vivek‚Äôs shares are not included in the 109m share float number. They never were.

2021-04-18 17:40:42,wallstreetbets,">Short volume is ultimately SI. Sure mm's short and cover.. but not in the millions. Or even half that. 

Almost every trade that you make goes through a Market Maker. If that market maker does not have a seller on the other side lined up, they will short the stock by selling it to you. Then, when a buyer comes along, they will cover by buying shares from the seller for just a little lower (maybe .005% lower) than what you sold it to them. That is how market making works. On the flip side if a seller came along with no respective buyer, the Market Maker will use their own funds to buy the shares and then sell back at slightly higher. That is how market making works. Apple has almost 17% of its daily volume as shorts. Does that mean Apple's short interest goes up by tens of millions of shares every day?? No it does not. Same thing goes here, sure a couple (maybe 5% max) of the shares that were shorted yesterday could have turned into actual shorts. Also keep in mind that almost every trade made by retail goes through a Market Maker and more than 80% of all trades are executed by algorithms.

Short Volume is NOT ultimately Short Intrest, in fact, those two things are hardly related and are hardly correlated. If you have any doubts look up short volume of other stocks such as $AAPL and any other blue chips and see how Short interest and short volume relate there: It is not how you think.

Here is a quote from Finra, the source of Short Interest and Short Volume,

>Some market participants mistakenly conclude that the bi-monthly short interest data is understated because the Daily File reflects short sale volume that is much larger than what is reported as short interest. However, short interest data reflects short positions held by market participants at a specific moment in time on two discrete days each month, while the Daily File reflects the aggregate volume of trades executed as short sales on each trade date. Therefore, while the two data sets are related (i.e., short sale volume may ultimately result in a reportable short interest position), they are not necessarily correlated.  
>  
>  
>  
>For example, if a firm sells short 1,000 shares of security ABCD, then purchases 1,000 shares of ABCD later the same day, the short sale volume in the Daily File will include the 1,000 shares that were sold short. Because the firm sold short and purchased an equivalent number of shares that day, it did not establish or accumulate a short position in ABCD; thus, its short sale has no impact on the reported short interest in ABCD.

2021-04-18 11:45:42,wallstreetbets,"No buddy, it's pointing out that he's a hypocrite. 

A whataboutism refers to pointing to a third party, not accusing the same person of hypocrisy.

And considering his only argument/evidence was the accounts age, his argument can be dismissed by ""evidence"" with the same weight (i.e: his own account age)

Your volcano example isn't equivalent at all. Firstly, both of these guys just showed up and neither is more trustworthy than the other. More importantly, the first guy showed his reasoning while the second guy just goes around saying ""What if he has ulterior motives?! He just showed up!"". His entire argument is moot because he doesn't address the claim *at all* and his only appeal, trying to attack the person saying it, applies to him equally.

2021-04-18 13:09:55,wallstreetbets,"Eh no worries man. I would never hold that against you. However, From the sHoRt rEpOrt "" Department of Justice (DOJ), which is investigating at least 12 issues ranging from kickbacks to marketing practices to undisclosed third-party deals, according to a Civil Investigative Demand (similar to a subpoena) we obtained."" To begin with investigations either lead to charges or they don't. Even if they do they may not be criminal. That's just the gov being the middle man, it is expected. Same shit happened with Aphria when Health Canada was investigating the quality of their product. 

The other thing that part similar to a subopena is a loaded statement. Why word it like that? A subopena is a fucking subopena, To cause FUD. The report is poorly written IMO. Combine this with the fact that they are ramping up hiring despite it I feel more confident in it.

EDIT:
The response is worth a read to and far better than the short report IMO. A CEO isn't going to make statements to perpetuate a scam. That will get you fucked by the SEC and DOJ."

2021-04-18 05:01:51,wallstreetbets,"Disclaimer: This is not financial advise, I'm a random on the internet feeling more bearish than bullish on this stock, seeking to understand why wsb is bullish.

Here: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521029637/d66346dex991.htm

>1. Did Chamath and/or Clover know about the ongoing DOJ investigation? If so, why was it concealed from investors?

>Chamath and Clover were fully aware of the DOJ inquiry.

>To be clear, Clover does not believe it is, or has been, in violation of any rules or regulations related to the inquiry.

>We went through both an IPO and¬†de-SPAC¬†due diligence process, and this subject received extensive focus and attention. Consistent with the views of Clover‚Äôs outside counsel, Social Capital‚Äôs outside counsel, and independently retained outside counsel of third parties, including IPO underwriters‚Äô counsel, we concluded that the fact of DOJ‚Äôs request for information was not material and was not required to be specifically disclosed in our SEC filings.


Per best practice if it's a question as part of an IPO you disclose it to prevent this exact issue coming up. If courts find that it needed to be disclosed clover will lose a class action, which will impact their operating capital, they do not have much and frankly do not have many resources to contest this as the firm bringing the case is legitimate and not a small shop.


Another issue is regarding revenue income sources of clover and the ownership of Seek Insurance.

>5. Clover‚Äôs subsidiary, Seek Insurance, claims on its website ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt work for insurance companies. We work for you‚Äù despite literally being owned by Clover, an insurance company. What is your response?

>While Seek is an affiliate, as we said, it operates separately from Clover, with its own financing and its own goals, which are to provide neutral, objective advice to Medicare eligibles and to empower, educate and assist them.

If inadequate seperation is found (extremely likely, seek has falsely presented itself and is 33-66% owned and controlled by clover) clover will potentially lose one of its better long-term exposure and recruitment methods (13.5% of seek insurance transactions wind up with clover).

Lastly there is some potential funny business with B&H and the DOJ is investigating illegal kickbacks, this shit if true sinks companies.


>6. How much has Clover paid B&H Assurance, the undisclosed outside brokerage firm run by Hiram Bermudez (its Head of Sales) since inception?

>Clover has paid approximately $160k directly to B&H since 2017.

>7. What portion of Clover‚Äôs business has been referred by B&H Assurance since inception? How many members?

>Approximately 8,200 of our current members were referred by B&H Assurance to Clover.

Sections 8 & 9 seem extremely dodgy to me, this needed full disclosure at IPO imho and should never have been a thing or question in a formal enquiry.

This reads very much like he said she said, my takeaway is that it's an artifact of kickbacks and/or an attempt to hide a conflicting relationship thinly veiled by a ""how dare you suggest that"" defence.

There are some further revenue discrepancies and product uptake concerns in section 12, the public statement is ""92% of onboarded physicians use our kit"" is shit. Section 12 discloses actual use of their software is 22% of physicians. That's a 5th of the uptake than previously disclosed. Ignoring their damage control number (22% of physicians its intended for use are live) the actual factual number is 4% of their staff are live on the platform. This undermines the shit out of section 11 where they state they don't upcode as the platform isn't meant for upcoding. Upcoding been another item they're been investigated for doing.


Tldr: They look dodgy as fuck, their financials could very well take a massive hit due to real and valid litigation and ROE is rediculously bad for them as even a short term pick. 

36% short is high but I don't think there will be much of a squeeze as I don't believe they're a viable business with this much bullshit lined up against them.

I also think this time the shorts are hedged properly, to use GME as an example that was 140% short, this is only 36%. And vanguard owns 18% of it, that's 50% of the current short volume they can loan for fees to short sellers to reduce exposure.

If vanguard affiliates own short positions they've already covered 50% of their positions.

Yes there is potential but I think the rocket will blow up on the platform or fizzle."

2021-04-18 13:26:20,wallstreetbets,"I think the major implication from the report was that Chamath had to have known about the investigation before the SPAC merger as he was doing his own due diligence, but never disclosed it to investors.  Without that report the issue wouldn't have come to light.  And if there are charges that come from the investigation, it will be a big deal.

I will say that I had a client go to prison for fraud, following a long DOJ investigation, for something similar to what is being alleged here.  Sometimes they're nothing, and sometimes they're something.  It should have been disclosed.

But I gotta admit, if it turns out to be nothing, what a buying opportunity this would be."

2021-04-18 05:56:04,wallstreetbets,"Assuming the companies response is valid, the DOJ question is null.  Are any class-action suits brought up by companies that don't have the resources to follow through?  Honestly, it's the most WS thing I've seen.  File a class action.  Lawyers make millions, shareholders get .001/shr.  


The issue with Seek seems like a non-issue to me.  They received 13% of the revenue generated by Seek.  If it were closer to 70%, yeah, that'd be a red flag.  But most of their business went to non-affiliated companies.  Hard to prove, IMO.  


The B&H seems the most likely to disappear.  And it seems you think so too since you didn't even include their response.  If nothing else, it would be a small fine and a slap.    


I'll look into their other revenue discrpeancies later.  In the short term, I think this goes higher.

Other than that.  I don't think you're quite a ""random on the internet"".  You got some cynical talents I don't have.  Despite my general bearish sentiment, I think every company is trying to do well.  You got a different take on things."

If Chelsea already owns stock shorting it down to shit isn't helpful to her, why would it happen if you don't think ""they"" wouldn't punish a clinton?

If she is looking at entering and the shorts were to make that more appealing we're already there as it's down 50%~ since IPO. Any purchases to rebound is just making more bag holders for her exit right?

In this hypothetical if the goal is to make the company successful, why is it been shorted?

A simple explanation is that it's a house of cards, Clinton as the insider knows this and they're shorting it because it will go bankrupt and they'll exit without needing to cover a single position.

Once again, this particular post is all wild speculation not tangible or financial advice."

I have a lot of clients who purchased a peloton during the pandemic. I think once people get into the habit of not going to the gym they wont go back. For people that have kids and jobs saving even a few minutes each day is a big deal. Also many of my clients have been vaccinated and still wont eat inside let alone work out in a gym. Until case numbers drop off a cliff I would buy the dip."

TL;DW: There isn't a bottom guard on Peloton treadmills unlike some other treadmills, thus children can get stuck under those treadmills much more easily than other treadmills."
2021-04-18 17:43:04,wallstreetbets,They lack a belt guard or end cap  that have been standard on treadmills for decades for exactly this reason. That's why the CSPB is lighting them up so much. They ignored an existing safety standard that was already put in place because of accidents exactly like this. So now we are having treadmill accidents that we had in the 80s all over again cause these guys don't know what they are doing.

Some wanker in design signed off on this in the knowledge it was a risk, I expect a company this large had more than one person raise concerns. I'm guessing it was for aesthetics more than cost, which makes it even worse.

What's so hard putting a guard there? Even a safety trip switch located underneath, when it detects something dragged under (though some damage would be done by then)."

2021-04-18 12:32:00,wallstreetbets,First of all you should wait for the share holders meeting when it comes to dilution and even if the vote passes there has been an official SEC filing about not diluting the stock any more in 2021. The CEO could dilute the stock tomorrow with 43mil shares outstanding from another vote but why should he do this while AMC is sitting pretty in the moment. I feel you are an GME ape but really no need to hate each other because both stock will moon. ü¶çü¶ß
2021-04-18 12:38:19,wallstreetbets,Ima a me ape and I think amc is fucking stupid. It‚Äôs not a moon stock and I‚Äôll bet 200 bucks to charity that it never breaks 35 by years end
2021-04-18 12:41:09,wallstreetbets,Even 35$ would be 700% gains for me. I will take it anyways. Good luck on your positions and stay positive my fellow ape.
2021-04-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,SPY 6/19 $420 LEAPs - bought for $0.69. 1100% Gain

2021-04-17 20:39:27,wallstreetbets,Hope you are cashing this soon.  It is possible we go to $452 on a measured move but we are at very dangerous levels to be long much. Our schools just got shut down again. We are on Wave 3 up from the low and sometimes that wave can get truncated.

2021-04-18 06:16:29,wallstreetbets,Ya I‚Äôm pretty chapped I bought so much further out date wise. My gain was much less.

MAR puts too as that hotel stock is in big trouble. See what happens next. Very risky time to be long a market that has went up this much on hope alone.

Pcr test is bullshit.  Casedemic doesn't matter.  Also if the dems don't have this crap cleaned up in 2 years people will be pissed.  They'll make some 2 year olds wear a mask and that's about it.  Michigan is getting railed right now. After it drips though them and the rest of places that need to get infected it will be mostly over.  It's never going away.  People don't give a crap anymore.

2021-04-17 21:26:30,wallstreetbets,I got them literally before closing bell on Friday. That‚Äôs what I consider a ‚Äúyolo‚Äù trade. I‚Äôm actually down too but I‚Äôm not worried because I basically bought past the theta. It‚Äôs just a tiny cheap swing trade.
2021-04-17 23:31:47,wallstreetbets,Yeah there‚Äôs no in app setting which is retarded
2021-04-18 02:49:54,wallstreetbets,Around here people do weeklies which is a fantastic way to lose your money in record time. LEAPS are generally considered months to years out. As far as selling 30-45 days is what I‚Äôve heard to be when time decay really starts to set in and the contract rapidly loses value.
2021-04-18 06:11:02,wallstreetbets,Teach me
2021-04-18 09:42:25,wallstreetbets,Teach me2
2021-04-18 14:02:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, ""buying past theta"" is not a thing and doesn't mean anything. You may be a bit confused. Theta is essentially the time decay on your options price. I suggest you read up on the greeks because people trading options who don't even understand the greeks never ends well."
2021-04-18 10:43:40,wallstreetbets,What do you mean by bought past the theta?
2021-04-18 11:10:53,wallstreetbets,30-45 days before it expires? Thanks
2021-04-18 17:59:33,wallstreetbets,"You can totally buy past theta!

...just buy stock lol"
2021-04-18 15:02:06,wallstreetbets,The theta is below a dollar moron. You can‚Äôt lose fractional pennys on options. It‚Äôs at .0026... the analysis has the same break even whether I sold on Friday or Monday.
2021-04-18 15:12:01,wallstreetbets,"Yeah so I just had a little exchange with him regarding ""bought past theta"" and it turns out he's just a retard and thinks he has no theta left to lose on that option (which is entirely incorrect). So he's just a moron. Gg"
2021-04-18 10:50:49,wallstreetbets,"If you put it in an analysis tool you‚Äôll see what I‚Äôm saying... it‚Äôs an option trader thing, you wouldn‚Äôt understand."
2021-04-18 13:56:43,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some variation to that, but if I recall correctly that‚Äôs roughly what Adam from InTheMoney said in one of his vids.

2021-04-18 15:09:28,wallstreetbets,"Wow yeah so you actually are a retard. No buddy, I'm looking at it rn and the theta is -0.2924. You really need to read up on the greeks because you clearly have no clue wtf you're doing. Good luck."
2021-04-18 15:15:52,wallstreetbets,Thanks for clarifying
2021-04-18 10:52:20,wallstreetbets,I trade options regularly. I've just never seen that phrase before. What analysis tool do you suggest?
2021-04-18 15:14:38,wallstreetbets,I understand the Greeks my guy... Vega and the IV even Rho the most useless Greek. It‚Äôs not that complex. Quit thinking you have a big brain.
2021-04-18 10:55:37,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it‚Äôs not hard to trade options... it‚Äôs click of a button on a phone app. Anyone with half a brain cell left can do it... I use thinkorswim... but there‚Äôs free ones like option profit calculator. It‚Äôs just time consuming to put in all the data whereas ToS is just a right click and updates in real time."
2021-04-18 15:17:36,wallstreetbets,"Ok so then you understand when the theta is -.29 you lose 29 cents per day per share per options contract simply through the passage of time? So you didn't ""buy past theta"" when there is still theta left to lose. If you have 0 theta then it is expiration. What aren't you getting about this?"
2021-04-18 16:11:10,wallstreetbets,"""Theta decay is factored into the friday closing price, but it's offset with by an increase in the implied volatility. The market maker ‚Äúprices in‚Äù weekend risk through a volatility adjustment, and does not allow the option to change in value over the weekend from theta."""
2021-04-18 16:18:33,wallstreetbets,"Oh, so you bought those options contracts AFTER market close on Friday? Nice, the rest of us normies can only trade options within market hours.

Edit: not to mention the actual loss of theta on expiration date itself. But yeah bro, u have no more theta left to lose. Gl with that"
2021-04-18 16:32:14,wallstreetbets,"No, read it again. Theta is priced in..."
2021-04-18 16:45:50,wallstreetbets,"... It's priced in, from Friday close to Monday open. Lol. Duh?"

Every post, I tell WSBs that this strategy still has excellent potential (smart-beta and stocks are still looking quite attractive). Every post, a smooth-brained idiot tells me smart-beta is dead, that this only makes money in bull markets (the last 220 years are not enough evidence apparently..), etc. And every time, I ignore them, follow the strategy (buying stocks if needed) and it continues to deliver.

Also, saw so much loss porn yesterday. Was a WSB lurker for years, used to be this site was about smart but risky DDs, and ballsy bets with good potential. Who can forget the legendary thesmd AMD updates from 2019? Now it's only about retards who lose money for a living with options they don't understand, and holding a stock just because they bought it higher and everyone else does too. It's not ""diamond hands"" dumbass, that's called ""sunk cost fallacy"".

If you've lost enough money to realize trading is like a casino, and want to make money again, WSB old-school style, well, this strategy STILL has plenty of potential to go."

So you use 100k of your money and 100k loan. You invest 40% in etf‚Äòs, 40% in spy puts and 20% remains in cash just in case you get a margin call. Your profit is the arbitrage between the etf and spy performance as i understood.

At the end max profit, max tax reduction for US people with minimizing the risk.

But this requires that the selected stocks and the spy puts do have a negative correlation, when these changes too much, then you would have to reposition"

I never understand why people on here who roll 10-100x leverage in weeklies, week after week until they blow up, always get so scared of something like this or a simple Boglehead Hedgefundie 3x risk-parity strategy.

Maybe the future will be good to you, maybe not, but the amount of ignorant fear every time you post is strange (too much leverage! beta decay!).  There was that one guy a few months back who really lit into you who had some valid points from the perspective of large-money management, but compared to what others here are doing.... 

They'd pretty much all be better served just picking some factors, leveraging somewhere between 1 and 4 times adjusted according to volatility and bands, and otherwise rebalancing once a year, and never looking at a chart."

2021-04-17 22:02:37,wallstreetbets,"It looks like I actually use a similar strategy: Heavy leverage (50% of unleveraged portfolio value), all the margin money invested in boring, diversified stocks and indexes.  Unlevered money in whatever shit I actually want.

As long as the levered money makes more than interest (2.5%), it's free money.  As long as I'm far from my maintenance value, margin call risk is very low."

Quick question: some of the tickers in your portfolio have relatively low trading volume, have you experienced liquidity issues? Especially when needing to de leverage"
2021-04-18 09:21:24,wallstreetbets,"Seems it would be smarter/easier to use a risk parity strategy using leveraged funds like UPRO/TMF at a chosen ratio. Much easier to manage, no margin required. Takes a strong stomach for the drawdowns. Lots of debate on optimal ratio of UPRO:TMF. Requires periodic rebalance which also has much debate to optimal rebalance windows (weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc).  

Best part is it does not require a large initial investment. Use monthly contributions to help rebalance. Funds do the leverage. 

Another option would be something like PDSLX which manages the entire portforlio (at admittedly higher cost). 

Obligatory, not financial advice."
2021-04-18 10:19:06,wallstreetbets,"Some questions, hopefully I am not too late to this post:

1) If you are selling equities to keep leverage from going over 2.2, won't that cause inefficiencies where you have both cash and debt (thru the short SPX boxes)? Or do you also buy back boxes when selling equities after a drop to reduce your cash balance?

2) Is there any reason to prefer larger spreads on the short boxes vs buying more short boxes (or the other way around)? Or does it make no difference? Some of your spreads are quite large, but I would imagine shorter spreads and more short boxes would allow you to buy/sell options that have greater volume?

3) Do you always buy the boxes with expiration dates out as far as possible? If so, why not earlier dates to get better borrowing rates?

4) What happens at the expiration date? Can you just let the box expire, or do you have to buy it back?

5) Are you worried about IBKR selling legs from the short box and causing your portfolio to implode?

6) What are the criteria that would cause you to reduce or entirely remove leverage? Specifically, if rates were higher, you had no income, or you hit some portfolio size would you delever? Or would you continue the strategy in any of those scenarios?"
2021-04-18 10:51:45,wallstreetbets,"Nice one. But I have to ask, it looks like the top 4 holdings (VBR, VFMF, FNDC, FNDF) were underperforming the Nasdaq and SP500 in the longer term.

I thought the Kelley Criterion had more to do with fixed odds like flipping a coin. The stock market is not a fixed odds, we know over time it continues to grow, with various dips along the way. For example let's compare SPY and SPXL a 3x leveraged SPY, and SPUU a 2x leveraged SPY. The ETF comparison tool I use only goes to 5 years so I can't really see ""bad times"" in it but there have been some ups and downs. In down times the 3x dropped a bit more than the 2x but there is no comparison in the end. 3x leverage is better than 2x leverage. So I presume 6x would be better than 3x. :)

PDSLX theoretically would perform better in a rising rate environment as they use corporate bonds rather than treasuries. Course, also doesn't mean it would outperform against your portfolio. Especially considering costs."
2021-04-18 13:09:48,wallstreetbets,"Thanks. Appreciate the info and am looking forward to the comprehensive guide!

On the box spreads: given that having X times larger spread vs X more short boxes are mathematically equivalent, I have a suspicion it should not make any difference because the market maker algorithms should see them as equivalent. I don't know for sure though. It might be possible to test this by slowing walking down limit orders with different spreads and seeing if they get filled at the same borrowing rate.

On borrowing costs: one could argue that because you are borrowing at close to the risk-free rate, the expected return on your borrowed equities should always be the equity risk premium. And if the equity risk premium and equity volatility are independent to the borrowing rate, then the borrowing cost should not affect the strategy. It sounds like you do not buy this argument if you would leverage less if borrowing costs went up? I'm not sure I buy it."

When the equity risk premium appears abnormally large (either because stocks are really cheap, or risk free rate has gone down substantially, or both like in March2020) or abnormally low (like it would‚Äôve been the case in 2000 when rates were near 4% and equity forward returns looked to be basically as large as that), then I change the amount of leverage somewhat.

I think the same could be done without borrowing money. Sufficiently deep ITM leaps can provide you with a similar leverage without theta-raping you and you can build your portfolio around them.

EDIT: not sure if similar tax-wise though."

1) Open a portfolio margin account.

4) Borrow more to buy more when leverage drops and vice-versa, to maintain leverage at around 2:1.

Edit: just saw below post on box spreads....will read more into it"
2021-04-18 14:25:56,wallstreetbets,Is that different from regular margin?   Or an ibkr specific term ?

2021-04-17 21:18:25,wallstreetbets,"The price I paid for something doesn‚Äôt dictate the price I sell something at. The price I sell something at is based on my expectations of a stock to a specific price by a specific time and the value of the option when it hits that price. How often have you seen the markets dip 1-2% in the am only to watch it recover and gain 3% in the same day? Those kind of swings happen on a more macro scale more often than your family members celebrate their birthdays.    

Also, I am a hedged trader. Value means relatively little to me as I make money when the stocks go up or down, but lose money when the stocks I buy stay neutral."
2021-04-18 14:25:26,wallstreetbets,There was a pdf u linked entitled nikhil.pdf Ithink ... it was on optimal leverage?
2021-04-18 07:56:32,wallstreetbets,"There's a good paper about deleveraging when the spy is below its 200dma because volatility tends to be much higher when that happens (volatility and leverage are natural enemies) .  The resulting risk adjusted returns are 0retty great.   Also I've been thinking to maintain an allocation to other asset classes like bonds,  realestate ,  etc. To avoid massive drawdowns. 

How long have you been running this type of portfolio?   Leveraged equities only will blow up eventually, or at least suffer a huge drawdown, even if diversified.   I do agree though that 2:1 is the upper limit of optimal leverage"
2021-04-18 14:27:51,wallstreetbets,"Cool 

I think there's plenty of evidence trend following works in terms of avoiding major drawdowns, the issue isthat  you often miss the bounce back and don't see market beating returns until a full market cycle is complete"
2021-04-18 14:29:31,wallstreetbets,"The keys to leveraged investing imo are 1) low cost of capital , 2) minimizing volatility drag, and 3) avoiding the big drawdowns.  Handle the downside,  let the upside take care of itself"
2021-04-18 14:43:20,wallstreetbets,"Just curious, what was your original starting amount invested?"
2021-04-18 01:59:05,wallstreetbets,"LEAPs will have higher borrowing costs due to the downside protection. Plus they're less liquid, offered in fewer relevant ETFs, and much less tax efficient."

2021-04-17 23:15:22,wallstreetbets,Dude used 8x leverage on 3x leveraged ETFs (so 24x leverage). That kind of ludicrously stupid usage of leverage really gives leveraged portfolios in general a horrible reputation.

The theory is solid although they apply it to a specific time period. They get a different answer as the Kelly Criterion for stocks, but that's because of the data they use."
2021-04-18 10:53:30,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I think I've seen the paper you're referring too. To the extent 200dma is a strong volatility **leading** indicator, then I think it's fine if you use it. I don't use it because I don't see much of a theoretical reason for why that should be the case. But maybe one day, I'll put together a spreadsheet with historical 200dma offset from VIX, and just see if regressing one on the other is statistically significant. That would be the first step towards convincing myself there's something to it."
2021-04-18 14:32:06,wallstreetbets,"I totally agree with you that there's decent evidence for trend following. But it doesn't carry enough economic intuition for me to feel confident about it continuing. Cross-sectional momentum, OTOH, has much more statistical evidence and some pretty good intuition, so I do use that. Again, it comes down to your personaly beliefs, therre's no right answer here."
2021-04-18 14:35:11,wallstreetbets,"Again, if that's your beliefs, that's totally fine, I don't disagree. We all have to look at the evidence and economic intuition and decide for ourselves. I'm only challenging your statement of ""she **needs** to include bonds and risk management like dma200"". I don't think that's true, that's all."
2021-04-18 15:01:02,wallstreetbets,I started with like $5K at Vanguard years ago buying dumb index funds but I didn't start leveraging until I had $200K. I would've started sooner had I known what I know now.
2021-04-18 03:37:37,wallstreetbets,"Will post a guide tomorrow, where I address this. Stay tuned!"
2021-04-18 13:20:01,wallstreetbets,"First, look how much I have to type just to kind of explain this shittily(because I am not actually giving away anything here)If I actually explain this(which I don't because I never want to be fucking dfv'd with people trying to find ways you didn't abide by your employment contract), it would be pages long. There are literally joke Due diligence posted on here with more effort. 


I literally said ""the very basics of advanced"" and ""she"" now says I don't know advanced tactics...

And really, if she isn't giving you more detail, then she literally actually only understands the VERY BASICS of what she's doing.

Look, I'm a fucking asshole myself, not pretending I'm not. I'm just not going to half ass explain something that can bankrupt you if you don't get it. I'm not sadistic. The reason this type of stuff isn't pushed on you, is because anyone who masters it shuts the FUCK UP ABOUT IT. I have no incentive to thoroughly explain it without you paying me. I'm better off taking the money available to me in my circle, creating a sophisticated portfolio, manage money for those around me, and make money. 


Here's the major red flag:
If you EVER see a person posting their returns, and they annualized them, when they don't have even one year of trading on the account under their strategy, that person is not a sophisticated trader. No sophisticated trader will post their under one year results bragging. There's a REASON the results look so good right now. The way this is being portrayed to you is EXTRMELY misleading as to the long term results, as well as how this will need to be managed. I would never show you this stuff myself without showing you a 5 year track record. Massive redflag again here? No explanation of reg T vs portfolio margin, no real thorough explanation of how you'll keep and manage the leverage as the portfolio increases or decrease, etc. 

Look, you can use leverage, that's not my issue. I'm fucking leveraged out. The explanation is pathetic at best though, and this isn't a ""revolutionary"" strategy. It's just barely understanding the advanced basics."
2021-04-18 03:00:22,wallstreetbets,"I don't disagree with sounding condescending although I hope you can see that if people have actual questions or want help, I will either answer directly or let them know where to look for the answer. I only patronize those with irrelevant or rude comments, such as those telling me how I'm an idiot, stupid, this is just as easy as just leveraging in a bull market, doing a terrible job explaining, and so on. I guess in my mind, if the sole purpose of a comment is to offend, I'll just offend back.  
I probably should just ignore it though."
2021-04-18 07:59:18,wallstreetbets,Lmao
2021-04-17 21:42:39,wallstreetbets,"Think about all the noobs that are listening to your advice who don‚Äôt understand how to look at short interest, apr to loan out your shares, implied volatility, insider buying/selling and other stuff. They would be in for a world of hurt because they don‚Äôt understand that the market moves up and down. I‚Äôd rate the advice you gave the same rating I would to people who call trading ladders a ‚Äúrisk free strategy.‚Äù Seriously, one of the first things I had to learn about trading and investing was doing the inverse of what you said. I hold through profitability, especially with high alpha, high risk option plays(when I pay pennies for a reasonable x10-20 expectation). Imagine trading options and selling out after a 25% loss which is a 2% intraday swing. In short, never let your losses dictate the price you sell your options or shares at."
2021-04-18 14:37:09,wallstreetbets,Cool thks
2021-04-18 14:24:18,wallstreetbets,Sounds good... just from what I've seen a leveraged equities only portfolio gets crushed periodically even withonly  2x leverage.  Having leveraged equities + some bond or safety allocation seems to be a better portfolio solution overall.   And using some kind of risk management like 200dma seems to work even better.   Just my 2 cents I'm not sure how long you've been running this strat.  Last real bear market was in 08...
2021-04-18 14:39:16,wallstreetbets,If anything it seems trend  / absolute momentum has an even stronger statistical basis than x sectional:  https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Journal-Article/A-Century-of-Evidence-on-Trend-Following-Investing
2021-04-18 14:39:44,wallstreetbets,Both are legit approaches though
2021-04-18 14:41:14,wallstreetbets,"Ok true you don't need it,  I personally think it adds value though.  It'll become apparent whenever the next real bear market is..."
2021-04-18 15:15:33,wallstreetbets,"So you turned $5K into over $700,000? Can you point me to what resources you used to learn?"
2021-04-18 04:26:39,wallstreetbets,"Been waiting for that, I might start that portfolio with 200k and see what‚Äôs what !"
2021-04-18 11:44:36,wallstreetbets,"Ya I think if you ignore rude people on the internet you'll get a lot farther.

There will always be rude people no matter what your opinion. But the one thing everyone hates is a perceived ""holier than thou"" attitude.

If you believe in what you are doing the haters don't matter and aren't worth acknowledging outside of empirical rebuttals."
2021-04-17 22:07:02,wallstreetbets,"Lmao clearly you‚Äôve never actually invested with leverage. I‚Äôm recommending people keep leverage under control and de-lever if losses accrue, a vital part of any leveraged strategy. Doing the opposite, as you suggest, is exactly how you can get wiped out and lose it all."
2021-04-18 14:58:22,wallstreetbets,"Ok I think there's a small communication error from my part. In my mind, there is a big difference between:  
1) What I called ""trend-following"": Using a moving average like dma200 to decide when to fully exit my position and delever, and go back in.

2) Managed futures (aka time-series momentum): Using a composite of various lookback windows to determine a trend, then sizing a long/short position based on expected volatility and adding it as a diversifying alternative to your portfolio of stocks.  


However, I just realized AQR calls managed-future ""trend following"" as well, which I thought was the colloquial term for DMA, technical strategies.  


Ok regardless, I don't hold much hope for the first one (which you suggested). It would be really tax-inefficient, plus inconsistent with the Kelly Criterion. No matter how bad the trend, I never expect a negative equity risk premium, so I'd never exit the market.  
However, some amount of it is reasonable. So either decreasing leverage somewhat based on a trend, or adding a small position in a dedicated managed futures fund on top of my portfolio, is much more reasonable. So it's a matter of degree. I have some confidence in managed-futures a la AQR, but nowhere near enough as an actual timing model to sell everything like DMA200 suggests.  


OTOH, cross-sectional momentum? I feel pretty good about adding as much as I can to my stocks. So regardless of my leverage or bear/bull market, I always want the trendiest stocks."
2021-04-18 14:59:50,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough, obviously for my sake I hope you're wrong, and obviously for your sake, I hope you're right haha."
2021-04-18 15:25:51,wallstreetbets,"Oh no, that's not what I meant. I have contributed plenty of money to this account from saving.

2021-04-17 22:20:15,wallstreetbets,"Investing with leverage? Please explain... I trade predominantly options, and I find a hedge for my positions that meet my expectations for profitability. Buying more when it is going down is how you average down and increase your long profits."
2021-04-18 02:19:04,wallstreetbets,Yep I am a moron and totally get what you are saying. I recently tried to figure out how to use the insanely low interest rate on a home loan to finance some of my share purchases. Unfortunately the tax man in Australia let‚Äôs you gamble away on realestate and offset your cost against regular income but not do the same with shares. This is an interesting alternative albeit a bit more risky due to the shorter timeframes of your box spreads compared to a multi year fixed home loan.
2021-04-18 16:38:33,wallstreetbets,Do you lever down during drawdowns?   I assume you've back tested this strategy over a few market cycles

2021-04-18 16:51:24,wallstreetbets,"I just sell to maintain leverage at around 2:1, or maybe a bit higher, during drawdowns. During great Bull markets like now, I let leverage drop a bit below 2x as well. So a bit of contrarian market timing in that sense I suppose."

This is a place where all memes are either ultra wsb niche specific zeitgeist atm or for attempting to influence the greater market simply through the virtue of your own ability to create sharable, autistically-insensitive media content.

Please comment and UPVOTE if you like what you see and I'll post more depending on what you all want to see this summer!! I finally got enough karma to post on WSB so let's GO!!!

[US Weekly Box Office Grosses \($\) - Source: Bloomberg 4\/17\/21](https://preview.redd.it/tu8r6jo3rst61.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d0fced0cbc3ace032915b3d860fe811bead118f)

I know you Apes have been waiting to hit the big screen! Well Warner Bros. ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" has infused new life into the jungle and a struggling US box office in 2020, prompting an upward revision in 2Q estimates across Wall Street. Yet it's too soon to draw conclusions. Film delays and ""day-and-date,"" or studios streaming movies on the same day as their theatrical release, are risks.

***1)  ""Godzilla vs Kong"" to Top Box Office Again***

It's is expected to top box-office charts for a third consecutive weekend with an estimated $8.7 million, bringing gross receipts to $82.6 million, according to Box Office Pro. California's ArcLight shut down last week, Regal's staggered reopening will continue, so the lack of new films this week should pull total receipts 25-30% lower, based on Box Office Pro estimates. ArcLight and Regal should give AMC an edge going into final spring months and even the early months of the summer when Box Office blockbusters usually get released.

***2) US Vaccine Available To All in 2Q; Theatres Also Gets Shot in Arm With Reopenings***

With cinemas only gradually reopening, 1Q21's box office totaled just under $240 million, an 87% plunge from the $1.83 billion in 1Q20. While that's not totally surprising, 2Q results will be much better, given the success of ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" even with only 55% of cinemas open. As Regal & AMC reopens more of its theaters in April, 2Q box office may hit $650 million, based on Box Office pro's projections, despite Disney's decision to release highly anticipated summer movies ""Cruella"" and ""Black Widow"" on its Disney+ service at the same time as they're available in theaters. Warner's ""Mortal Kombat"" will be out on April 16.

***3)  'Godzilla vs. Kong' Monstrous Open Roars Box Office Back to Life Around the World***

Following a strong international open, Warner Bros. ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" U.S. release had high expectations leading into the long Easter weekend. Those receipts, coming in slightly above the $13.5 million [the studio initially reported](https://variety.com/2021/film/news/box-office-godzilla-vs-kong-nobody-1234948900/) on Sunday, propel the film‚Äôs overall tally to $70 million. After two weeks of release, ‚Äú[Godzilla vs. Kong](https://variety.com/t/godzilla-vs-kong/)‚Äù already ranks as the highest-grossing movie of the pandemic era, surpassing Christoper Nolan‚Äôs puzzling sci-fi thriller ‚ÄúTenet,‚Äù which ended its theatrical run with $58.4 million.  (Source: Variety Magazine / Variety.com).  This as a step in the right direction leading into the summer blockbuster period as hybrid day-and-date release strategies aren't deterring fans from the theatrical experience. As more vaccines are distributed and theater capacity restrictions are relaxed, expect continued higher box-office receipts.

***4)  AMC Re-Opens California Cinema To Kick-Off Summer Early***

In a small step toward recovery in the global film industry, AMC, the largest theater operator in the world, announced the reopening of 54 of its California locations in March. Disney‚Äôs ‚ÄúRaya and the Last Dragon‚Äù is projected to take the weekend‚Äôs top spot, while Roadside Attraction‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Courier‚Äù are other notable new films releasing this weekend. (Source: Bloomberg 4/17/21)

***5) Wall Street ""Hate-Love"" Relationship***

Wall Street analysts absolutely HATED the stock in 2020. From May 2020 to March 2021 there wasn't a single BUY rating. B. Riley analyst Eric Wold was the FIRST to put a BUY rating on AMC since the pandemic. On Friday he said that the CEO‚Äôs comments on the share authorization should be interpreted as good news on AMC‚Äôs cash position for the year.

On Wednesday, Aron told YouTube host Trey Collins in an interview on ‚ÄúTrey‚Äôs Trades‚Äù: ‚ÄúWe hereby pledge at AMC that if the shareholders approve this authorization for 500 million new shares to be issued we will not use one of those 500 million shares in calendar year 2021. Not one. Not one.‚Äù

Aron also said AMC still has authorization to issue 43 million shares ‚Äúthat we could use if we wish to raise some cash, if we decide that‚Äôs a good idea. We have made no decisions yet. We are thinking about it, but we haven‚Äôt made any decisions yet.‚Äù Excerpts of the interview were [disclosed in a securities filing ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000110465921050489/tm2113075d1_defa14a.htm)dated Thursday.

Over the past year Wall Street analysts still keeps a fairly high rating on the stock,

&#x200B;

***5) AMC Lightens Up Debt Like GME***

Like all companies, going into the pandemic highly levered (with tons of debt) wasn't a good idea, which is not surprising that so many hedge funds went after GME and AMC. GME recently announced that they are going to be debt free and AMC also lightened up their load this year when various PE firms like Silver Lake and Mudrick coverted their convertible notes into equity.

[AMC's debt in coming years is low and at a very low interest rate \(sub 3&#37;\), with the majority of its callable debt maturing in 2026. The company is now generating cash flow again which will easily have plenty of runway to get them through 2021 and to 2026. They should have no liquidity issues this year so as long as theatres continue to re-open. \(Source: Bloomberg 4\/17\/21\)](https://preview.redd.it/o6kgwc4f9ut61.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b8df16a0de21a46980107df20eeb7e1e4df7387)

***6) SHORT INTEREST BACK UP***

Almost at 100% utilization, and 93.92MM shares short interest, next week will be interesting. Borrowing rates have also jumped back up this week. For those who are hoping for a gamma squeeze or short squeeze, I'm sure there are tons of you already reading other DDs and watching YouTube videos so I don't need to explain here. We're all here to make money. I'll be honest, I did a YOLO bet using AMC Call Options on the first pump up to $20 in late Jan and paperhanded and took gainz on the ride up. Now that the stock has pulled back to a decent level, this time I'm using shares, as there is just way too much market manipulation going on in the weekly options expirations with the market makers. This week, I saw tons of tutes coming in buying big blocks (100,000 to 1,000,000 share blocks) of AMC throughout the week, and I started accumulating from the high $8 range. Will continue to watch the MaxPain and options activity in coming days and weeks and play the trading range in addition to HOLDing shares.

2021-04-17 21:09:43,wallstreetbets,"I think the real question here is what's your cost basis on those shares?  If it's 15, you're fucked, if it's 4, you're golden.  The real bet you're making isn't that AMC all of a sudden has good fundamentals or a better business model, it's that 1) retail will push up the stock on general good feeling from reopening, 2) there will be a short squeeze, or 3) now that the Paramount decision has been overturned, one of the big streamers (probably Amazon) will buy AMC and you'll get a premium for your shares.

All of those are fine bets to make, and it's your money, but this DD just pretends like AMC the company is somehow better, and it's really not, plus it's been heavily diluted from pre-pandemic yet is trading at pre-pandemic prices.  I don't dislike the stock enough to to buy puts on it, but I also definitely don't like it enough to buy shares or calls on it."

Edit : also a lot of places across the US are in tier slates communities that restricts the amount that go into places . That restricts your sales. Plus a lot of people are still not comfortable until they been vaccinated or they hear herd immunity is amongst us. I know some of my family who haven‚Äôt gone out because of this thought process.

2021-04-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Explanation of the $CLOV 10k and Calculating Short Interest by hand Edit: I seem to be getting downvoted a lot, yet not a single person has replied criticizing my math and the numbers....

TL;DR: The real short interest is 35.1% and the data provider which first reported 140% has changed it back to this number. Also, I apologize in advance for disrupting the echo chamber.

Over the last two days many people all over every social media platform have been in debate as to what $CLOV's real float count is and what the real short interest as a % of the Float is. I am here to explain what went wrong in FactSet's calculations (which have now been fixed BTW: [source](https://imgur.com/gallery/HocOE0G)) and to calculate the float by hand using information and data provided in $CLOV's 10k to confirm the validity. Feel free to criticize any of the data presented.

Here are some facts that are not being widely disputed for reference:

* There are 145,345,832 Class A shares outstanding -[source](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521102551/d89571d10k.htm)
* The CEO owns 0 Class A shares -[source](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521102551/d89571d10k.htm)
* There are 38,504,281 Shares Short as of March 31st 2021- source: FactSet can't provide link but it seems as though this figure is not being disputed.

What is being disputed specifically is the number of shares that are part of the publicly traded float:

Yesterday FactSet reported that float was \~26.3M shares down from what they were reporting 2 days ago at \~109.8M shares. FactSet had subtracted 83.5M shares from the float making the denominator in the SI/Float equation plummet causing the short interest% to skyrocket to 140%+. FactSet incorrectly made this subtraction. **The CEO's shares were NEVER part of FactSet's calculated Float to begin with.** FactSet's float had always consisted of tradable Class A shares, yet it subtracted the CEO's Class B shares from the float. My guess is that someone challenged the data provided by FactSet and an analyst at FactSet changed the number according to the challenge but did not spend the time to properly verify the validity of the data they were changing. Now the number has been changed back to 109M shares float.

&#x200B;

Now for the 10k:

&#x200B;

[10K color coded](https://preview.redd.it/asn64bf8hst61.jpg?width=1708&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e98280fa82eb00501fdaa8e5d10d811a678b65f0)

This 10k is very easily misinterpreted without looking at the subscripts at the bottom. There is so much overlap when it comes to shares owned. Reading the subscript #3 at the bottom we can see that **Chamath's 30M shares are overlapped with the 20M and 10M shares owned by SCH Sponser III LLC and ChaChaCha SPAC C LLC** respectively. This means that the shares owned by SCH Sponsor III LLC + the shares owned by ChaChaCha SPAC C LLC + the shares owned by Chamath's = 30,500,000.

Further, Entities affiliated with Ian Osborne also own 25,500,000 Class A shares. As we above, 20,500,000 of those shares are from SHC Sponsor III LLC **which are already included in Chamath's 30,500,000 Class A shares.** This leaves an extra 5M shares owned by Ian Osborne that are not related to entities owned by Chamath.

Therefore, there are 30,500,000 + 5,000,000 = 35,500,000 Class A shares owned by Insiders and locked up. **The rest, 145,345,832 - 35,500,000 =  109,845,832, are part of the Float.**

Taking the #of shares short and dividing by the Float that we calculated gives us:

(38,504,281 /  109,845,832) \* 100 = **35.05301958 % of float being shorted.**

Now to clear up some more misconceptions:

[Vanguard's 26,185,529 Class A shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000110465921049151/tv0001-cloverhealthinvestmen.htm) are completely tradable and not locked up whatsoever and therefore, are still part of the float.

*Processing img qxzqcfeajst61...*

It is clear from a close reading of the 10k that there are many things wrong with the data here:

1. Vanguard should not be considered as part of the Class A Lockup shares since they can freely trade AND lend shares. Therefore, those 26,185,529 shares **should not** be subtracted from the shares outstanding.
2. The creator of this table failed to realize that Chamath's 30M shares are the same as SCH Sponsor III and ChaChaCha SPAC C's shares and mistakenly subtracts them from the shares outstanding twice. Further, 20M of Ian Osborne's shares are wrongly being subtracted as well since they are overlapped with SCH Sponsor III."

2021-04-17 22:27:53,wallstreetbets,"Well the number of shares that traded hands on Friday was around 250M, so the short to volume ratio is \~36%. Shares trading multiples of their float in a day is not too abnormal of an occurrence. But the high short volume as you pointed out could mean that since March 31st (from which the latest shares short # is reflective of) the Short Interest could have gone up. But it would not have gone up by 89M shares. A vast majority of those 89M shares that were shorted were likely immediately covered. Market Makers regularly do this to keep up with buying demand and then immediately cover when they get the chance. Apple's short volume for example is around 17%."

2021-04-18 10:24:36,wallstreetbets,That's not how gamma squeezes work. Options are hedged when written by institutions. So it needs to have either a wild swing upwards for fresh calls to be written or some unusual options activity to start a gamma squeeze.
2021-04-18 17:07:52,wallstreetbets,"Here is my reason I think mortgage companies are a terrible investment right now.  At least for the long term. 

Hyper inflation is coming, it‚Äôs actually already here.  I think in the next few years, we see inflation similar to post WWI Germany (ok, maybe not THAT bad).  

And who stands to get the most fucked from this?  A mortgage company.  Why?  Fixed rate mortgages. 

When one dollar today, is worth 10 dollars in a few years.  Your 2500 dollar a month fixed rate mortgage is gonna seem like 250 dollars. They‚Äôre going to be stuck making pre-inflation profits.  Also, when a 2 bedroom house is worth 1 mil post inflation, not many people will be buying houses. 

In fact, the best move you can make to prepare for hyperinflation is to borrow as much money as possible (ie. a mortgage) at a fixed rate before the inflation occurs. In a few years time, those payments will seem like tiddlywinks, and you‚Äôll be able to pay off your debt easily. 

If hyperinflation occurs, and I truly believe it‚Äôs coming, we will see mortgage companies going out of business left and right."

2021-04-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Extremely thorough CLOV recent action DD I‚Äôm going to go back a little bit in time and tell you how CLOV was directly related to GME squeeze.
So when GME was squeezing two very influential people have backed the squeeze and caused it to squeeze even more. Those two people were Elon Musk and Chamath Palihapitiya. Both partners in previous endeavors and friends. 
GME squeeze hurt short seller Hindenburg so much that they have lost 40% of their account that week. 
CLOV is backed by Chamath Palihapitiya. Hindenburg, in order to retaliate at Chamath for causing them huge losses, published a short seller report for CLOV few days after Chamath tweeted about GME. Short seller report had very little base, yet that caused the stock to drop and also SEC had to initiate an investigation due to the claims. 
Since then stock got beaten down to less than IPO prices. What does that mean? It means that it was moved not so much by true owners of the stock, but mostly by short sellers. That will play in nicely in the squeeze because short sellers always have to close out, but if stock is still held by their true purchasers it means that there are even less shares available for active trading. 



Enough of history. Retail following:

Since GME endeavor Chamath PAlihapitiya joined the club of ‚Äúretail gods‚Äù.... he is one of the poster babies for retail movement on hurting short sellers. His previous partnerships with Elon Musk furthers retail following so now not only we have GME crowd supporting Chamath, but also Tesla crowd. Both of those stocks were some of the most successful trades in history. 



Friday‚Äôs Hindenburg‚Äôs fright with CLOV:

On Friday CLOV has opened with 148% short interest and after this was noticed by retail the squeeze has started. The volume topped 250M shares traded (10x average daily volume and 5x its previous heaviest volume day). (Ill get in to more technicals later, but needed to mention this to push the narrative).
Hindenburg saw the action and protecting their possible short position tweeted that FactSet has misleading short interest data about CLOV not including CEOs clad B shares in the float. 
FactSet came back to Hindenburg‚Äôs allegations with a reply that CEOs type B shares are classified as not tradable and are not included in the float. And once again confirmed that stock is 148% short.
This further angered retail traders and a lot of chatter online has started how Hindenburg is trying to manipulate this stock with lies and deceit. 
A lot of people didn‚Äôt catch on on Friday but through the night and this afternoon Reddit and stock twits seem to have exploded about it, videos are popping up on YouTube. A lot of traction is being created over the weekend for a sweet Monday open. 



Technicals:
*CLOV free float is 109mil 
*CLOV shares outstanding are 406mil
*78% of CLOV shares are owed by insiders and are still locked up. Insiders are only allowed to sell if stock hits $30 and stays above $30 for 90 days 
*institutional ownership of CLOV is at 48%

*the volume on Friday was 249mil shares which only represents 61% turn over for shares outstanding, but if you take locked up shares out of consideration, true turn over was actually 228%, meaning every share available to trade was bought and sold at least twice on Friday. 

A lot of people that bought on Friday (including NEXT financial group that bought 21,400 shares) will not likely be actively trading this week meaning available shares short term will continue on decreasing.

In my speculation out of 109 mil free float Only around 35% of shares will be available to trade this week. Here is how I got to this number: 
-institutions owe 48% of stock and they are not likely to trade short term fluctuations, but giving it a benefit of doubt let‚Äôs say that institutions that will hold account only to 30% of float. Now we only have 70% of float left to trade....
-let‚Äôs assume that investors that owe CLOV long term account for 20% of the float. A lot of them don‚Äôt check stocks daily or sometimes even weekly. Let‚Äôs assume that half of them even won‚Äôt notice what is happening this week. At this point we only have 50% of float left to trade. 
-the rest of the free float is being traded by scalpers/ day traders, swing traders and ‚Äúdiamond handers‚Äù. This is a very educated group and unless scalping or pattern trading will understand that we are in the middle of the squeeze and hold. I believe this group will contribute to another 15% of float being unavailable, assuming half of them will be trading fluctuations and half holding. 
So my conclusion is: only 35% of available shares will be circulating next week being sold and bought over and over again. That‚Äôs only 38mil shares not being stuck in someone‚Äôs account semi permanently. Some more liquidity will be provided short term by other shorters flocking in, but I won‚Äôt take them in consideration because they too have to close out at some point. 

Fallowing all this speculative, yet very carefully vetted math let‚Äôs calculate the demand for the shares, just to close short positions
-148% of the free float is shorted, meaning 161mil shares will be in demand just to close out short positions. Since we already established that there will be only 38mil shares freely circulating in the market each short share will only have 0.24 shares. So looks like there are 4 times less shares than demand to close short positions! Throw in some buying activity to that math and you have a number closer to 10:1. 

Following all of that the question is how far the stock can go during this particular squeeze? Well the answer is: it‚Äôs mathematically impossible to calculate. Although there are some indicators of what people can expect. Smaller the float, the bigger the short interest and the heavier the volume the further it can go. In this particular instance we have the combination of all three factors. Even if it‚Äôs impossible to predict exactly what price short squeeze will hit, it‚Äôs possible to trade short squeeze well using technical indicators and trade management. Monitoring volume, daily short interest and days to cover should be adequate. To know when short squeeze is ending I monitor same indicators that made me spot the short squeeze to start with, but in reverse. Meaning volume will start to tapper off, short percentage decrease and the upwards momentum will start to whilt. I also watch out for extremely sudden, needle like falls (trailing stop loss domino effect). 

I hope the read was interesting and I haven‚Äôt lost you half way through. 

I won‚Äôt go into any CLOV fundamentals or any of that good stuff cause I think we already established that everything is in order there. It is also completely irrelevant in a mathematical squeeze."

They'll pretty much own any meme stock with a call/put imbalance, they are market makers and they need to delta hedge the calls they sold. In that respect they don't really own the upside fully, but give it to the call buyers for a fee (= they make money no matter what *usually*). Since their hedge position can become big, they need to report it through the official channels.

2021-04-18 05:04:24,wallstreetbets,"Dude that was the best time of my life. 

In like the very beginning of February last year I took my $4k I had saved up and saw people making shit loads here so I ballsed up and learned how to start trading options. In my first big trade I made $1300 off of SPCE in the golden days. Little while later, the market began crashing on feb 21st. News about coronavirus came out saying it has a high chance of spreading to America. Wsb was chaos, it was clear this drop was not the end. It only took me about 3 hours to realize that pure spy puts were the move. Made $18k off of it, more money than I‚Äôve ever had in my whole life. I could pay off my student loans right then and there. Instead of doing the smart thing and taking some profits, I decided to stop reading posts from wsb and trade on my own. Within like a week the puts I had got wrecked and it was clear they would expire worthless. Slowly I watched that money burn up into nothing. 

But god damn was it fun as fuck, my favorite day was when I woke up and saw I was up $10k within the first 10 minutes of the market being open. I went to my class chipper as fuck, felt like I had a 10 foot cock."

At this point, just short the whole market. Because why not, the market itself might just be a dIsTrAcTiOn from GME since I'm pretty sure Citadel is beta-positive.

It's just sad that something that started as a great squeeze is turning into QAnon-level conspiracy shit and brigading, with apes suffering from stock-oneitis shitting on anything non-GME, pathetically upvoting among themselves even if comments like the one I'm replying to are entirely nuts."

2021-04-18 13:15:36,wallstreetbets,"The original SI number that everyone was touting around on Friday was 149%. HUGE difference between 149% and 35%. Also here is a list of the highest short interest stocks as of last reporting period:

[https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest)

**There are 9 more stocks with higher short interest than $CLOV right now**. 

>You realize anything over 10% is considered abnormally high

Well obviously ""abnormally high"" is subjective but to put into perspective:

[https://imgur.com/gallery/axKmPA7](https://imgur.com/gallery/axKmPA7)

648 out of the 8037 stocks (8%) on FinViz's screener have a short interest of greater than 10%. And 27 out of the 8037 stocks (.3%) have a SI of over 30%. 

The conclusion here is that 35% SI on a stock is **more than a daily occurrence**. A GameStop like squeeze here is very very unlikely or else we would see 10+ stocks squeeze at those magnitudes daily."
2021-04-18 01:28:58,wallstreetbets,Would be better off just buying more GME.

2021-04-18 17:23:31,wallstreetbets,"No, the point of the feint is that it cannot and will not squeeze because the short interest simply isn't there in the quantity that you're thinking it is. It will *look* like a squeeze is happening if FOMO occurs from people who don't do their own research, but all you'll end up with is a worthless bag at the end of it.

It's fascinating, and at the very least, I've learned more about the market in 4 months than I did years prior."
2021-04-18 16:14:59,wallstreetbets,"There are squeezes every single day in the stock market. Every single day. In a bull market, the stocks are squeezing 100-300%.

A few months ago, there were 300% runners everyday. This doesn't happen without shorts getting squeezed when the price breaks resistance. They get nervous and start covering causing the price to go up and the old supply zone becoming a new demand zone.

Recently, the daily top gainers have only been 20-30% so the risk/reward for shorts is much lower and they hold their position longer without covering. This die to depressed volume market wide. Algos aren't buying small caps or hyper growth stocks so it's too easy to pull the rug. Remember, algos make up 80 -90% of the trading volume and when those algos are turned off, volume dies.

In the current market, especially for small caps and hyper growth stocks(the stocks most susceptible to short squeezes), the bears have no fear. So not only are they shorting at resistance, theh are doubling down at support.

This will eventually turn on them. Stocks don't go down forever. Again, when your top gainers are 10% to 30% with the top gainers of the day only being 20-30%, shorts have absolutely nothing to fear. The risk/reward is out of whack. Whereas in a typical market with 6-12 top gainers over 30%, shorts don't know what one will squeeze to 300%.

Eventually, the algos will get turned back on and the volume, especially in the premarket where it has been abysmal lately,  will turn the 20-30% gainers into 100-300% and shorts who short without consideration for risk/reward will get squeezed."

2021-04-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Tom Brady of asset management ? People love to hate Cathie Wood but her funds get results. Some thoughts from an analyst who takes a quantitative approach. [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-tom-brady-of-asset-management-people-love-to-hate-cathie-wood-but-her-funds-get-results-11617371226](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-tom-brady-of-asset-management-people-love-to-hate-cathie-wood-but-her-funds-get-results-11617371226)

CFRA thinks ARKK (ARK Innovation ETF) has a high likelihood of outperforming its global equities ETF category in the next nine months based on our multi-faceted ratings approach,‚Äù they said, concluding, ‚Äústick with this top performing ARK ETF.‚Äù

Cathie Wood founded ARK in 2014 and has been in charge since then.

It‚Äôs also somewhat unusual for being an active, fully transparent manager of ETFs.

&#x200B;

Cathie Wood runs 7 different ETF's (of AT LEAST 1 year in existence) and they all have gone up from 177% to 391% in the last 16 months or from January 1,2020 to present.

Only included stocks (ETF's) with 1 or more years history. Did NOT include the ARKX fund or Ark Space Exploration & Innovation ETF since it is less than 1 month old, with a March 30,2021 inception date.

Hard to believe but the results AND charts speak for themselves .

&#x200B;

Even if you took out the March 2020 LOW prices and went with January 2020 or February 2020 highs (high share prices BEFORE the Covid19 or coronavirus stock market crash of March 2020),the results are nevertheless extremely impressive.

&#x200B;

High performance over one performance may be attributed to luck by SOME investors but when you consistently have greater than 20% yearly returns over 7 different stocks (or ETF's),then that is WORLD CLASS stock market skill. You are doing something RIGHT.

Cathie Wood is a genuinely extraordinary and extremely aggressive stock picker and analyst. No doubt about that. Her far above average results speak volumes about her skills and abilities.

&#x200B;

Extremely transparent stock picker who shockingly reports her various ETF's investments on a DAILY basis. Not monthly or weekly.

Love the transparency. Very, very unusual.

&#x200B;

April 1,2021 : If Your Mutual Fund Becomes an ETF, Here‚Äôs Why : Ark Investment Management‚Äôs Cathie Wood brought attention to the category with her slate of actively managed funds that were among the best performing U.S. ETFs in 2020.

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/if-your-mutual-fund-becomes-an-etf-heres-why/2021/04/01/937c43be-92af-11eb-aadc-af78701a30ca\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/if-your-mutual-fund-becomes-an-etf-heres-why/2021/04/01/937c43be-92af-11eb-aadc-af78701a30ca_story.html)

&#x200B;

What‚Äôs the difference between a mutual fund and an ETF?

In both mutual funds and ETFs, investors are effectively pooling cash to buy assets by buying shares in the fund. However, mutual funds can only be purchased at the end of each trading day, while ETFs can be bought and sold INTRADAY.

Mutual funds tend to have higher minimum investment requirements and often charge higher fees.

""For most investors, ETFs are more tax efficient, as their structure allows them to minimize capital gains"".

Although both come in actively-managed and passive forms, the majority of ETFs track indexes, while mutual funds are more commonly actively run by an investment manager.

&#x200B;

Cathie Wood : Worth $250 million as of October 13,2020 : Truly self-made and EXTREMELY successful.

&#x200B;

Cathie Wood certainly is a disruptor. Lots of gutsy and extremely unusual stock market moves . An early investor of Twilio Inc, Square Inc., Spotify Technology S.A. stock and Shopify Inc.

&#x200B;

Let's leave with the immortal words of John Templeton :

&#x200B;

‚ÄúIt is impossible to produce SUPERIOR performance unless you do SOMETHING DIFFERENT from the majority.‚Äù

Sir John Templeton : In 1954, he entered the mutual fund market and created the Templeton Growth Fund, which averaged growth over 15% per year for 38 years.

2021-04-17 20:29:08,wallstreetbets,I'm still in ARK cause I don't mind bagholding for a while and its not money I need right now. However SPY is at 420 and her funds are way off their ATH's. It doesn't inspire much confidence. What's gonna happen once SPY inevitably corrects again. ARK hasn't gone up with the market the past 2 months. But its sure as hell gone down with it.
2021-04-17 20:43:47,wallstreetbets,All I know is she bites her lower lip intermittently when she's talking and I think it's hot as fuck
2021-04-17 23:20:26,wallstreetbets,I only listened to her on a couple of interviews but she only invests in companies with good data and i think thats what sets her apart. Aren‚Äôt all her moves public too?
2021-04-18 07:23:02,wallstreetbets,"Only reason everything crashed on Madoff when it did is because he couldn‚Äôt raise enough money for another fund.

Hopefully all these new funds holding the same securities aren‚Äôt being used like that, I‚Äôve got more faith in her as a human than Madoff."
2021-04-17 22:30:09,wallstreetbets,"Cathie is a perfect example of survivorship bias. 

&#x200B;

Every year you have hundreds of fund managers making risky bets on high beta gambles. A few of them pay off big time. A few of those make subsequent successful bets etc. Eventually, you're left with Cathie. That *someone* would fall into this role was a statistically guaranteed with the long bull run. Happens to be ""Jesus take the wheel"" Cathie. 

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, the fact that she is *not* finding alpha at all is about to become painfully obvious over the next year or two. In fact, her returns are likely below median when risk adjusted."

2021-04-17 22:40:12,wallstreetbets,"Beware cults of personality including the current obsession with Cathie Wood.  She has been very successful recently, but all her gains happened during an overall market expansion.  Peter Lynch managed Fidelity's Magellan Fund and had a cult following 30 years ago.  Lynch did great during the 1980s expansion, then his returns flattened and he quietly retired in 1990.  Cathie Wood will hit a wall soon enough, just like Lynch did, or she may be taken down by one large miscalculation.  Either way, no one ever stays on top for long, life just does not work that way."

2021-04-18 19:13:26,wallstreetbets,I recently got into this for the first time a couple days ago based off a friends recommendation and some articles for backup. So naturally I like this DD. Thanks.
2021-04-18 09:00:46,wallstreetbets,"Cathie Wood is a good example of being penny foolish and pound wise. ( The opposite of penny wise and pound foolish). Her general thesis is correct but it doesn't look like she as any idea what she's doing on a technical basis. Her recent tsla buys (and sells) are a good example of this. She likes TSLA. At the beginning of the correction TSLA dipped she bought some more immediately. TSLA continued to decline, she bought more. TSLA continued to decline until the NASDAQ fully corrected to 10%. (this was the right time to buy) She never bought more after the second purchase. She got scared.  Market resumed upwards. TSLA increases. TSLA continues to go up. Biden announces infrastructure plan which would greatly benefit TSLA. She sells TSLA stock. She's buying stuff for the future so they are generally good calls but some of her moves clearly show she is inexperienced with trading."
2021-04-18 05:11:28,wallstreetbets,Her funds need more GME to be considered the GOAT. My portfolio however has 100% GME diversification so she can have 2nd place only.

2021-04-18 00:06:43,wallstreetbets,"I see this point a lot but I think it gets exaggerated.  I only buy ARKK though so idk shit about their other funds though.

ARKK is:

24.4% mega cap

47.3% large cap

25% mid cap

and only 3% small cap

Granted their fund is so big that their holdings in some of the smaller mid caps amount to like 10% of these companies.  But for the bulk of their holdings I doubt there‚Äôs much of a feedback loop.  Again at least for the K fund.  It might be very valid criticism for the G, F, W, and whatever else mama is running."
2021-04-17 21:40:51,wallstreetbets,"Agreed.   


You're a pretty terrible analyst if all you do is look at the prices going up and decide it's good (which is what the OP post is). Analyst my arse. 

The stocks ARK invests in are often small and illiquid. What drives the price of stocks? The transacting parties! ARK are in many cases a dominant transacting party. 

Inflows to their ETFs are self-reinforcing. They get the money, they must invest it and it goes toward purchasing the small stocks. This drives up the price of the small illiquid stocks. Boom! ARK funds have outperformed!"
2021-04-17 23:08:16,wallstreetbets,"This is why they stuck boring large caps in the space etf. They needed somewhere to stash excess capital.

They did the same thing in their other ETFs, there's large caps that have no business being there. They also increased the holdings to spread things out."

During bull periods they rotate gains out of those high conviction stocks (that do stellar) to ""diversify"" into the aforementioned. They will harvest tax losses as appropriate and beneficial, as well."

2021-04-18 01:53:50,wallstreetbets,It's pretty comparable in risk-adjusted return.  But QLD (2x QQQ) is a better comparison for sure as the absolute risk and return are right around where ARKK is.
2021-04-18 10:58:41,wallstreetbets,The chart above shows fairly similar volatility and superior gains for TQQQ. Given some of her recent moves with the fund I'd personally be more comfortable with the TQQQ risk going forward. Your mileage may vary.

2021-04-18 16:38:17,wallstreetbets,"Those are indexes, you dumb ass."
2021-04-17 21:43:40,wallstreetbets,"Two things. One, they cannot hold more than 10% of any holding in any ETF. They sell Tesla as appropriate, and buy as appropriate. Ultimately they continue to accumulate more shares in absolute terms, while the funds AUM will continue to rise, even if it's a balancing act. This leaves them plenty of dry powder to ensure they can always load up on any dips, and is why they effectively maintain a \~10% holding of Tesla in every portfolio it's admitted to.  


Secondly, their strategy for trading around market rotations and corrections. They load up on high-conviction stocks during bear markets when those stocks are down. They sell out of lower-conviction, ""mature"" stocks to fund this. During secular rotations and corrections they load up on the aforementioned ""mature"" stocks, to provide dry powder for rotations. They trade around these facts, including harvesting tax losses from the sales of the their ""not high conviction"" cash-like holdings.   


That said, Cathie has made it clear they think Coinbase has significant growth potential. They're not selling TSLA to buy COIN. They're selling TSLA because they're required to. If anything, they sold SQ to buy COIN (which is a much fairer comparison, obviously). Cathie has also made it very clear Tesla is their highest conviction holding, period. Don't read into daily trading reports/put words into peoples mouths things that directly contradict their own public statements. Coin is not juicier than Tesla, in Cathie's opinion, until and unless she actually says as much.  


They keep cash on hand because they're actively managed and have to, y'know, trade shit daily."
2021-04-18 14:20:58,wallstreetbets,You were proved wrong and still stuck to your guns. Amazing. Please look into how these funds are managed. I‚Äôm tired of reading this same stupid argument you‚Äôre making from 10 different people a day.

2021-04-18 06:14:40,wallstreetbets,"I am subbed to their daily trade letter

She sold less etf% of TSLA in ARKK than she bought during the feb/march correction

It's like she bought ~1.5% of ARKK in TSLA during feb/march drawdown, but only sold ~0.75% the past few days

Oh and if you look back further they bought back about the same % that they sold at the highs in january

You should prob get their newsletter that way you can actually analyse their trades. They obviously don't get everything right but they buy on dips and sell on rips AND actively manage their portfolio and they're a big fund now so it's much harder for them i bet to remain nimble like that"
2021-04-18 15:21:53,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm not sure what axe you‚Äôve got to grind here. Tesla is weighted ~10% in their funds. It grew beyond that. She trimmed it back to 10% it‚Äôs not an argument that‚Äôs literally what is going on. There are no lines to read between

Regardless, talk about fucking stupid. He has to pay that money back at a (likely) high interest %. He'd be better off just returning any excess towards his loans."

2021-04-18 11:35:21,wallstreetbets,Gme is not about to moon tho
2021-04-18 01:55:00,wallstreetbets,"How was it ""exactly"" the moment GME was about to moon? The cult kept saying that every week. 50k or 100k extra shares by DFV are not contributing anything to the momentum. At this point just consider any piece of news about any ticker as suspicious, because every week you're expecting GME to ""squeeze"".

Compare the rhetoric of those bagholders with the crazy shit QAnon is saying and all the ""signs"" they're seeing. Yeah, pretty much the same."
2021-04-18 12:21:38,wallstreetbets,"The short was already high, then Vanguard bought 18% and it got predictably shorted back down in 3 days. At that point they dug their own grave thinking they could get away with business as usual shorting."

2021-04-17 20:18:18,wallstreetbets,I think it is artificially suppressed by shorts for sure. The true float size is 108 million and not 145 million. Certainly not 405 million as most of those are non tradeable class b shares. So that works in the short squeeze favor dramatically. I think this is an easy $20 stock. Analysts have it as a minimum $13.25 stock. If this gets enough traction it is going to crush the shorts. I say best opportunity I‚Äôve seen since GME hands down
2021-04-17 21:29:31,wallstreetbets,smells like shorts are going to get squeezed to 15-20 minimum. maybe as high as 30
2021-04-18 11:03:16,wallstreetbets,The best way is as GME taught us: 50% shares 50% may calls
2021-04-18 06:34:04,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-18 14:25:09,wallstreetbets,Yea. AH gave me a lot of conviction as well as finally sorting out all this data. 108 million shares outstanding. 40 million short as of mid day Friday. Quite possibly higher now with all the volume. If this blows past the 10 resistance I think we are looking at $15 easy. Maybe as high as 30-40
2021-04-18 10:34:06,wallstreetbets,I think it's a shit company and the Hindenburg research made more sense than it should. But yeah will still buy at <$7.5.

GME in two months ain't gone beat that if it goes well..."
2021-04-18 11:12:37,wallstreetbets,I think GME is just a long play now. It‚Äôs settled. Depends if you want to try and make some tendies on momentum. This has a lot of traction
2021-04-18 09:05:09,wallstreetbets,"Well, thats just wrong."

2021-04-17 23:56:22,wallstreetbets,"If you‚Äôre speaking on the DOJ inquiry I could see how that might present questions if you‚Äôre not educated in how healthcare insurance companies operate or the strict regulations. Speaking from experience (owning multiple pharmacies) I can tell you DOJ inquiries happen frequently when doing large scale business because healthcare experiences more fraud than any other sector. Especially when it comes to Medicare. 

I would suggest as with any stock do your due diligence. I‚Äôm sure just like the rest of us you will determine this is a growing company with strong revenues to support along with a great team of executives. The technology is disruptive and going to be a major attribute to the cms direct contracting model."

Failing to mention, perhaps intentionally, is the larger concern, and what has the SEC attention, hence their label of it being a fraud investigation.  

As I said, I don‚Äôt think its a major deal in and of itself.  However, it is not uncommon for a small issue being an indication of a sloppy due diligence before release.  Not suggesting it should rule out investing, but it should be part of the consideration."

How does the business work? Cohu makes capital equipment for testing semi‚Äôs. They have two businesses, selling capital equipment to other firms, and offering testing to companies that want to outsource that process. 

We all know that there is a global semiconductor shortage, which is a strong catalyst. But the real catalyst is increasing volume. The number of semiconductors per phone is increasing. With 5g devices, there are nearly twice as many chips per phone as compared to 4g. This means twice as much testing. Additionally, with the move to electric vehicles, the automotive testing segment is growing rapidly. Cars that used to have only a few chips, are now crammed full of them. This trend of increasing chip volume is true for PC‚Äôs, phones, electric vehicles, self driving vehicles, IOT, cloud computing, and ai development. All of these growing industries have one thing in common, the need for lots of semiconductors to continue driving innovation. 

Financially cohu is a very attractive stock, even having nearly tripled in the past year. With a nice 42% profit margin and growing revenues, the company is still fairly priced. Ttm gross profit is 271 million, compared to their market cap of 2.3 billion. This is a market cap/profit ratio of 8.48. (So if you bought the whole company you‚Äôd make your principle back in 8.5 years and be able to sell for 100% profit assuming no change in valuation)."
2021-04-18 01:07:58,wallstreetbets,"I worked in the semi industry and can attest this, so far the main challenge for COHU is to remain relevant in the current 5G upgrade cycle, they have fierce competition from other players and their technology is behind, the one thing that works great for them is that 5G's rollout is delayed compared to the initial expectations and they are shameless when it comes to pursue a deal."
2021-04-18 02:28:09,wallstreetbets,"This company is not tied to the same massive movements like the developers.  $TECH is a reagent provider and grows as the industry grows.

2021-04-18 11:11:15,wallstreetbets,"I work for a school in Asia where Roblox is insanely popular and a lot of my students spend money in the game religiously. These kids have a stellar education and are also learning how to code from 6 years old.

If any place in the world would be clamoring to use Roblox as an educational tool then it would be here, but it just won't happen. It's a nice bit of padding to talk up the educational benefits of the game but in all honesty I don't think that'll amount to any additional interest or value in the stock. 

Gaming just isn't used in the classroom like that, at any level, and change happens very slowly in education. Steam Pedagogy is a non-starter I'm afraid, at least for the foreseeable.

I'm not saying this stock won't do well. I'm just saying it won't be for that reason."
2021-04-18 18:13:27,wallstreetbets,"Roblox is the only game/app that my 12, now 13 yo, daughter truly got addicted to, and I mean that in a bad, bad way. IMO p2w is f‚Äôing lame but for her was like crack. Anecdotally I‚Äôm hearing the same from other parents. I gotta think parents‚Äô willingness to spend cash on f‚Äôing Robucks is gonna hit a wall sooner or later. First time ever unauthorized charges showed up on our cards (linked to ApplePay) from Jan to mid March. Never had spend problems with her before Roblox. 

Thankfully I was able to get refunds for those charges and literally bought 2 GME with the refunds, for real.  

She also blew whatever cash she had in her CashApp account. The only thing she didn‚Äôt do was sell her 2 AMC and she bought via CashApp on her 2nd attempt on that day when trading was halted, god bless WSB for teaching her to hold (seriously I‚Äôm not making that up)

As for the educational component of Roblox with schools I‚Äôm skeptical. But I‚Äôm also very biased so will watch with interest. 

All that said I was still seriously considering RBLX dpo long at 40-45 but it was way overvalued IMO and at this point I‚Äôm not touching it. 

Ahh, thanks for letting me rant. I feel much better now. :-)"

2021-04-18 09:42:32,wallstreetbets,"GME short interest *is* currently low though, the borrow is ridiculously cheap as well. I kinda think its more probable that 100000s of apes invent some conspiracy theories because they are overly invested in GME to keep it alive, than any of the complicated alternatives they throw around being true. A common and shared conspiracy theory is that hEdGe fUnDs hide in the derivative markets so that they don't have to report SI. Even if that were the case (and I doubt it, since this creates and ARB opportunity with cheap borrows), the media isn't wrong for reporting that SI is currently low for GME. And by the same metric CLOV is over shorted."

2021-04-17 22:04:09,wallstreetbets,Warrants are like an option but 1/100th the size and issued by the corporation and usually don't expire for multiple years.
2021-04-18 01:08:11,wallstreetbets,"Basically what the other comment said. 100 warrants would be similar to buying an $11.50c (usually) LEAP. They are callable by the issuer typically if the stock averages above a certain price for so many days, so just keep that in mind."
2021-04-18 05:52:42,wallstreetbets,Clovw is the warrants ticker
2021-04-18 09:36:23,wallstreetbets,"They more or less trade like European options, but they can usually also be redeemed early. This makes it somewhat interesting for a squeeze as well. Its usually something like the stock needs to be above $20 dollar for 20 trading days or similar, then the warrants can be redeemed early (i.e. you can buy stock at $11.5). If the probability of an early redemption moves up, the warrant price will move closer to stock price - $11.5."
2021-04-17 23:14:47,wallstreetbets,You do realize a drop from 9 to 7 (-2$) is percentage wise the same as a drop from 150 to 116 (-34$).

YES THE VALUE OF AN ASSET DOESNT CHANGE JUST BECAUSE THE VALUE OF THE USD CHANGED. Just because the value of a currency has changed it doesnt mean the value of an asset has changed. It just means that the quantity of currency you need to procure has changed for you to get the same amount of value from the exact same asset. Yes you're right that the market will correct the value lose of the usd but just in QUANTITY not in value. A piece of land stays a piece of land, a stock stays a stock. Ofc i am assuming that there wont be heavy change of supply and demand just viewing the inflation isolated. But there wouldnt be a heavy change and supply and demand anyways. Now lets take this example : 1 Piece of Bread costs 1$. The FED decides some Simbabwe monkey shit and prints more Money (Money printing isnt really what causes hyperInflation, Its the liquidity of the central bank that actually causes hyperinflation and not being able to deffend the currency on the forex market, hit me up if you want some reference). Now 1 Piece of Bread costs 2$. Did the value of the bread change? No it did not! THIS IS NOT A CRASH UP in the sense you mean it. Its like calling 1 Centimetre, 10 milimetre. Just the reference has changed( yes european here with a good school system who had economics in highschool).
Anyways live long and proper monkey brain. Too much hate out there. Maybe shouldnt have called you monkey brain but i hope you learnt something and dont use stupid language like ""crash up"".

I think you dont even really realize what a hyperinflation really is about. You wont think about investing into the stock market, you will fight for the last piece of bread you find on the ground, therefore your first comment was also very stupid to begin with, Op never said buying puts in hope for a hyperinflation he just said puts dec 2022, maybe he just thought of a market crash.

The set up is too public and the retail interest has never been so rampant, ever.  Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong about the retail interest part, I‚Äôd be curious to know what stock has captivated the market in a larger way than GME.

2021-04-17 22:40:39,wallstreetbets,"My thesis actually conflicts with yours. My thesis is that they are trying to collapse tech and increase oil stocks by shorting bonds. The correlation has been there since April and maybe longer. My thesis is that the government wants to see inflation and the stock market go up steadily, but now they have to wait for a jump due to the people shorting bonds.    

Personally, I would point at Ken Griffin‚Äôs history with bonds and the deep understand of how bonds effect stocks. Followed by a deep look into their institutional holdings(specifically citadel) in cyclicals and deep history of shorting stocks. By using a few billion dollars to short bonds, it would be possibly to profit trillions by shorting tech and buying cyclicals."

He literally defaulted into the role because the previous CEO ""BK"" was kicked out, due to a ""consensual relationship with an employee"", which probably was true, but in reality he was kicked out for fucking up 10nm so bad.  Intel did a CEO search for months, and at the time couldn't find anyone they wanted for the job.  Murthy Redunchintala wanted the position, but the Board did not want him to have it.  So Bob defaulted in.  He never was a tech visionary and I think he was just maintaining the ship while the company tried in vain to sort itself out with other hires."

2021-04-18 06:36:39,wallstreetbets,DIS is a buy and hold but WSB are looking for a 10X in the next month.
2021-04-17 23:00:35,wallstreetbets,"You optimism is misplaced and you seriously miss the negatives.. Disney is massively overvalued.
    
1. Parks revenue decreased 99% in 2nd quarter of 2020.   3 of 6 open about 50% of the population will NOT get that stupid vaccine that has a 99.97% survival rate for those under 50.
    
2. Disney cruises closed until November I believe. Meaning many Disney resorts will flounder.
    
3. Disney Star Wars is massively underperforming, Galaxy's Edge is a flop, actually caused attendance to drop!
    
4. Disney hotel and resorts under booked. Mostly locals going to parks.  Limited capacity. Scaled back 50th anniversary celebration.
Many new rides delayed, 2 new SW hotels scaled down.
    
5. Disney+ is no longer a threat to Netflix. Netflix used to consider Dis+ #3 but now dropped them to 5... According to Netflix internal analysis its 1) Netflix, 2)Amazon 3) Hulu 4)Hbomax 5) Disney+ 6) Tubi.
    
6. ESPN has had millions of subscribers cancel due to leftist woke politics.

    
 Those vaccines are having difficulty, delays, recalls, high mortality than all vaccines for the past 10 yrs.. There is still massive restrictions on travel, Disney cruises still shutdown until November. The 2 Star Wars hotels will be catastrophic flops like GE, extremely overpriced, limited appeal, limited pool of people that can afford once let alone repeat.     
     
 Galaxy Edge has massively underperformed, had constant ride breakdowns, boring.. Got lots of backlash for omitting the OT and PT.   Kathleen Kennedy has been a disaster to the SW IP... Just when Mandalorian was rebuilding the fandom, KK nukes Mandalorian by firing Gina Carano, ignoring OT actors, insulting half the country by pushing divisive politics... lucasfilm employees has numerous social media fiascos. The official SW channel cant post anywhere without being downvoted to oblivion. The High Republic is a flop.    
    
KK announced a huge slate of SW projects but she has a history of firing directors and doesnt understand SW at all and only uses it as a vanity project to push her ideology.     
        
 Mandalorian the show that broke the Disney+ servers with Luke Skywalkers return by firing Gina Carano,  caused a 2 year delay in The Mandalorian  and has lost tens of thousands of subscribers or much more. So many quit that Disney+ will not giving  updates anymore.. The backlash caused Wandavision to nosedive and Falcon and Wintersoldier to massively underperform to due to pushing SJWand BLM politics into it.. The MCU is becoming the M-She-U.and they hired political people who dont know comics, the characters or Marvel. Marvel comics is dying, they current writers insult and have driven off much of the fandom. We should be in a Silver Age renaissance of comics, instead comics are driving people away looking for fictional twitter/tumblr crowd who arent fans and dont buy the product.
Marvel Studios now blamed Lucasfilm for the underperforming.
    
  The people in charge constantly push politics. The female exec doesnt want to use the Xmen label anymore, one of the most icon brands since it's not inclusive. That type of mentality runs through Disney now. Another female exec is openly refusing to produce shows for "" white, Christian, trash"" even if well written, want to make shows to lecture not entertain. 
    
ABC has few hit shows and the few okay shows are aging.
    
Disney has created possibly a new rival in Tubi, flush with cash, its acquiring lots of IPs and making original programming. Meanwhile Disney is saddled with debt from acquisitions, civic, etc. Lots of bad publicity with Milan, HK and concentration camps.
     
Almost all their injuries are self inflicted. 
    
MCU stage 4, Black Panther 2 lost its star, Brie Larson is not popular, Eternals would have flopped if released. 
    
Read up on PiratesandPrincesses.net and watch Overlord DVD on youtube to get the other side and inside scoop. Disney is maybe worth $60 right now.."
2021-04-17 20:15:12,wallstreetbets,Shit my kid can‚Äôt even talk and I‚Äôm itching to go to Disney lol.
2021-04-17 20:17:56,wallstreetbets," people have changed their ways. the pandemic has made people less reliant on travel to fulfill their escapism needs. The hunkering down for + year has changed the attitudes of typical consumer. I don't know how much of an effect it will have, but it Is rael."

2021-04-17 23:35:38,wallstreetbets,"Dis should be at all time highs given the success of Disney plus and should be higher than $187 right now. Looking at ath pre covid at around $151 in Nov 2019 to $187 today, suggests to me that DIS is undervalued now. I love the move into Hulu and I think this gets ignored. As cable continues to decline, Hulu will rise along with the rest of streaming.  My own semi retarded calculation on dis value comes to a fair market value of 400b right now."

2021-04-18 10:46:33,wallstreetbets,"Tricky and risky to do in a TFSA investing vehicle. If you take a loss you lose your contribution room forever. Also you're only allowed to add $6000/year or your total contribution room since inception. , So depending on his other investments he may be maxed out already and can't average down. This is why I use my TFSA for robo ETF investing and just use a cash account for speculations."
2021-04-18 17:44:22,wallstreetbets,"Yeah TFSAs are really risky to yolo on. If your yolo goes good? Badfuckingass, continue growing that sucker tax free for years to come with an insane balance.

2021-04-18 14:35:55,wallstreetbets,"If his call option strike is higher than the buyout price, then his options become worthless"
2021-04-18 14:40:46,wallstreetbets,"That I understand but if the price rises those options are worth more, can't he just sell them?  Not hold till expiry.  The person above said buyout price at 20% premium possibility.  If that scenario plays out wouldn't all his calls be worth more than what he purchased them at?"
2021-04-18 14:42:55,wallstreetbets,"The current stock price is ~$40, a 20% premium is a $48 buyout price. His lowest call option strike is $55, meaning that any call option above $48 becomes worthless, because if the acquisition goes through, it will never go above $48"
2021-04-18 14:48:48,wallstreetbets,Those are almost 2 year leaps man.  He can just sell the option right?  He doesn't need to hold them.  Assuming there are buyers.
2021-04-18 14:51:04,wallstreetbets,"Yep, he can sell the options, but the option price will be worthless like I said due to a ceiling on the share price based on that example. To add, time (theta) doesn‚Äôt matter anymore, because the delta will never get there.

I‚Äôm not saying there will be a buyout or making any suggestion, just calling out what would happen in that example."
2021-04-18 15:04:06,wallstreetbets,Yeah I agree about the 48 price cap in the hypothetical scenario of a buyout and it won't move until after the deal goes through like what's happening with NUAN.  If a rumour or deal of a buyout causes a spike in price I would immediately attempt up sell all these calls.  I don't know if there will be buyers but I would attempt to sell them.  The price in the options chain should be up in the price movement?  Or is that not how it works?
2021-04-18 15:20:52,wallstreetbets,"If rumors of a buyout then yes options price will spike, but once the buyout price is known then any option strike above buyout price will be chopped"

2021-04-17 20:13:01,wallstreetbets,"I don't do otr anymore. I work local and am home every night. My gig involves delivering to construction sites. It's a mud and gravel lot and often the address isn't on a gps. 

Good luck automating that!

As for layover pay they required you to be idle for 48 hours before they paid you for the last 24. 20 years ago layover pay was 40 $ a day. And you can bet if the dispatcher was paying attention I'd get a dispatch to pick up a load 2 days later during the 47th hour. Happened all the time. When I worked for Swift I had to write down everything's that I did and was supposed to get paid for. They would ""forget"" to pay for things on every paycheck. Pack of fucking thieves.

Trucking companies advertise about how many new jobs are going to be needed but in reality most of those openings are from high turnover rate. In OTR drivers are just a piece of meat behind the wheel. They've bolstered their numbers by hiring more immigrants. These are folks who often are used to being treated like shit.

I think most carriers are perfectly fine with laying off their drivers and going fully automated.

Back in 99, CFI laid off all it's owner operators without notice. The next day they offered to rehire them without health insurance. 

I'll never drive otr again. 2000 was the last year I did it."
2021-04-17 22:46:11,wallstreetbets,"Few years ago I saw mention of driverless Long Haul rigs that pulled up to Hubs for a driver to get into the truck for ""Last Mile"" somewhere. If they are paying them Cut Rate for short trips who knows what the future might look like."

2021-04-18 11:15:32,wallstreetbets,"Stream schedules, if your content is good and you're not growing it's because you don't stream in regular intervals so you leech the viewers you already have over time.  I haven't streamed in ages myself but had a decent number of followers and regular viewers mostly from c++/asm dev streams (mostly around ludum dare), and picked up a weirdly large (though not massive) following at one point doing random challenge streams in games.  I did it long enough to see though that when you keep a schedule you gain pretty easily but once you go off you start dropping fairly quickly as well.

&#x200B;

Oh and interact/talk, even if nobody's watching, describe what you're doing or something, people don't hang around in streams where the streamer is silent."

2021-04-17 20:49:50,wallstreetbets,This smells like WALL STREET gonna sell some calls and they going to be $0.00 at some point. This just does not feel right with a PUT / CALL 0.20 ratio.  GME was not this imbalanced when it took off. Six weeks under $9 .. MaxPain is $10 ... The volume of trade last week was enormous and the stock only rose 7.4% and stayed under the resistance shown for weeks? You are going to need a lot of luck I believe. This is much different than when GME took off. Back then people were not fully invested and looking for the next awesome thing.
2021-04-18 02:01:38,wallstreetbets,Good enough to screenshot good enough to sell..  Hope premarket Monday doesn't hurt these beauties

2021-04-18 07:39:31,wallstreetbets,"GME was not a sound business prior to the shorting (and still isn't yet). It made sense to short it in all honesty. It was a stale B&M store with barely any digital presence save for an archaic website, and was known for its garbage customer service, and crappy business tactics. The only reason the GME squeeze was successful was due to the significant amount of shorting.

I'm not saying they are the same company anymore. They are restructuring significantly now to position themselves as a business that can function in the digital age, but if they don't change things (like they are planning on doing) they are doomed to fail."

2021-04-18 14:39:27,wallstreetbets,"Sure because no one in their right mind believes it‚Äôs going back to 350 or 480. So you take your 30 mil rather than watch 2/3rds of it evaporate.

Odds are he will sell covered calls to the retard crew here and milk them for awhile and sell out before the share holder meeting.

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a final update, because the minute he sells retards here will be out for blood, and his real identity is out there.

Think a little. No ones going to leave 20m on the table"
2021-04-18 14:41:32,wallstreetbets,"No, why don‚Äôt you think a little. He had every opportunity to cash out 40 mil less than a month ago, and you think he‚Äôs going to spend another 7m at $154 to sell at $160? God I hope you spend some time in the gym getting healthy, because if you‚Äôre this dumb, and ugly, fuck."
2021-04-18 14:54:24,wallstreetbets,"Oh I‚Äôve thought about it plenty, and I am sure he has a lawyer advising him.
He‚Äôs also the guy that admitted to liking the price at 40$something to Congress, so probably in a pretty tough position. 
And he‚Äôs kinda the face of this thing along with a bunch of other daily posters in SS. 
And I think when retail traders take their inevitable ridiculous loss here, they‚Äôre going to go screaming and crying to social media. 
I also think if it was me and I was sitting on what is it 36 or 38 million with shares and cash I‚Äôd be willing to eat a little (while earning some back via CC) to make it look good and insulate myself from the coming storm.

You notice he hasn‚Äôt done a DD video in a long long time right. You think that‚Äôs out of choice or because he spoke with the SEC?

2021-04-18 06:21:38,wallstreetbets,"Where does that 65% figure come from? 

https://news.gamestop.com/stock-information/institutional-ownership

Over 70% institutional from just the top holder figures on their website, which aren't present day, but they surely haven't changed *that* much. 13% is RC's company, roughly 30% seems to be index fund custodians (some might be active management within those companies), and roughly 30% seems to be private equity funds.

I plan to sell them with each broker (leaving 1 share in each account), in 10% lots for each 10% rise or fall in price AFTER they do something to meaningfully impact my free exercise (most likely prevent access to the platform through ""maintenance""). 

I expect all my brokers to fail and have to restrict trading at some point, the later the better obviously. 

I would like to maintain 101 shares in one brokerage to sell covered calls, and sufficient cash to sell cash secured puts for the months to come when I expect IV to be over 1000%."

My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring, we‚Äôd make meat helmets.

1. We are not in a bubble, in which case markets slowly continue making ATH as they have done for the past few decades.

2. We are in a bubble. Then we're only at the start of one. Why? There has been no exponential, year on year growth as it was the case in 1996-1999 yet. And that is despite the 25% of all money ever printed in the past 365 days. We have growth, yes, but not exponential growth and this is probably the biggest sign as to why we're not in the middle or towards the end of the bubble. It's why even Burry and Buffet are massively long instead of short. There won't be a massive crash for years to come, but there will of course be small pullbacks.

2021-04-18 15:02:53,wallstreetbets,"**How much $25k invested in SPY in March 2020 is worth today?**

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On March 23 the price of **SPY 6/18/21 $320** strike leap calls was **2.50**. Lets say we used $25k to buy 100 contracts and hold until expiration.

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the last price of **98.00** which gives us a total value of:

#$980,000

No TA and no DD needed. Invest in a boring index **on a dip** and you can secure your retirement.

2) \~ 20 - 25 % dividend stocks  ( PPL, PRU, MAIN, BNS, DUK, BCE et al ) - for constant new 

investable money by incoming dividends

 3) \~ 15 - 20%   speculative higher risk/reward stocks ( BLOK, RBLX , COIN )

 4)  Many of you will not like this , but I do not employ margin, options , futures or any  other

forms of leverage in my accounts as I have seen it backfire horribly  way too often on way 

too many people.

In a bear market leverage can destroy you, and do so very quickly.

Nothing is a surefire bet, but so much positive news for Disney all centered around the end of April plus their earnings 2 weeks into May. 

Get your calls in and I hope I, and whoever follows suit makes money. 

They should be worth double  NFLX as we go through reopening. D+ is the strongest competitor to NFLX as a must have, and their parks and other recreational stuff does double digits billions in rev. So this reopening is much needed and should be reflected in their price.

In @ Apr 30th 190c. Last week action has been very positive. So unless the markets dump, money is there to be made.

5. Find women with similar interests to your own, or who admire your new confidence and give you a shot.

2021-04-18 11:31:42,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve been in LEAPS since around 6 bucks. Last couple months have been frustrating...stock stalled despite strong monthly sales and the bullish q1 pre-announcement. Market obviously worried about this fucking chip shortage. Medium term it‚Äôs a great play - focus on trucks, shedding shit geographies, bronco, mustang EV, strong CEO. Let‚Äôs hope they blow the doors off q1 and tell us what they‚Äôre doing about the chips."

You could also try high yield dividend stocks with good IVs so that you could both cash in those dividends and sell OTM weekly cc's on them. Go to r/investing and r/options if you want to learn about those things though, this isn't a WSB thing."

If indeed the float math works out and lots of A shares hold on.  The squeeze is on.

My take: I'm buying a small number of shares.  It's a beaten down stock so the downside risk doesn't seem that big.  IV is high so I won't get fucked by theta like with options.

This seems like one of those ""small risk, if it doesn't pan out just sell.""  Like tails small loss, but if the squeeze happens you print."

( i too have sold early and lost much profitable opportunity, bu also I have sold early and kept losses, so I try not to focus on ""what could have happened."" ) 

My thought process is here say you buy in at 100 and put a trailing stop -20.   So if it moves up to 150 and then bounces back to 130 and stops you out for a profit.  When would you buy in and know that the ""dip has dipped"".  There's not an exact recipe but I would imagine when it has turned around started going back up, say it hit 90, then ran back to 100, that might be your re-buy in with a stop loss of say, -20 again.   

So maybe it's not realistic, but to me, on paper, it sounds well.  I hope to be able to test it one day."

Plus my basis is so low at this point it could do nothing and I'd still come out ahead.

IMO earnings might be the catalyst since as OP said every time they catch any volume the stock takes off like an actual rocket and volatility is always juicier around earnings. I've noticed as we've crept closer to May it's gotten more and more unstable."

*In a word: it turned the true out. Scorpion Capital did spread fake, false news about QS, they accused of QS with ""lie"" but they are lying in order to make money by spreading bad news, pulling the stock price down because they did short-selling.

2021-04-17 20:59:31,wallstreetbets,Apple car most likely not even until 2025 :(
2021-04-18 17:50:50,wallstreetbets,Thanks üòÇ
2021-04-18 08:45:02,wallstreetbets,"I didnt mean to trigger you guys but it doesn't take a genius to see the difference between a dying market and a growing market. All you told me right now is that they paid off their debt and theyre not going to go bankrupt anymore. While nndm has over a $billion in cash for the purpose of acquiring other companies to speed up r&d and production.
I'm not going to talk much about nndm because that's not the purpose of this post but all video games are becoming digital which means gamestop has to somehow sell something other than games. Every gamestop that I have ever been to has displayed scummy business practices to take advantage of their customers. Unless GME has a fundamental change in how they conduct business and decides to sell the customer an experience i.e. local gaming events, retro games, collectibles, merch. Then there's no reason people(gamers) are going to have a reason to shop there which means the business will die. 
Obviously none of this is relevant if your just investing in short term but I think I should have prefaced all of this with saying it doesn't make sense to invest in gme long term at this price.
Honestly I would like to hear an opinion from a longterm investor of gme and why they're investing in gme and what kind of future they see for gme and if they think its a good time to invest in gme or to just hold for a year. The only people I've been seeing talk about buying gme are short interest or related to screwing over hedgefunders which isn't really long term"
2021-04-18 09:22:29,wallstreetbets,"You looked at my profile so I looked at yours and saw that you're invested in blackberry. Before you say anything, yes I'm aware blackberry doesn't deal with phones anymore and that they're a iot company. Honestly I'm not going get into why bb is a good or bad investment but it just confirms my suspicions that all you do is invest based off of public sentiment and try to find any dd to defend your investments.
But you want to talk about yoy revenue, you don't even use that to base your investments in the first place"
2021-04-18 10:23:17,wallstreetbets,"Obviously most people are playing the squeeze right now but with Cohen as board chairman, their business focus will shift to customer appreciation and building an experience. I think he will be able to create a turnaround play here, he‚Äôs got the right people on boarded for it and this whole thing has been enormous PR. Let‚Äôs see how the next few years go and time will tell who is right: 

His 2019 interview re chewy, worth a listen if you actually want to understand why people are going long:

2021-04-18 10:12:14,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre going off public sentiment as well w NNDM. Public sentiment brings volume and I made a lot of money day trading BB during the spike, so my losses don‚Äôt actually reflect the reality of the situation. Harnessing public sentiment can be profitable.

As for revenue growth. I do use it to base my investments..once again, BB‚Äôs forward guidance in their statement said that they‚Äôre expecting 11-30% revenue growth across their various sectors. They have BB Ivy coming next year which will lead to an increase in perceived value and I think it‚Äôs absolutely undervalued trading at 4x revenue. Their competitors trade 40x revenue, so once their public image shifts, I expect growth. I‚Äôve mentioned before but I plan to hold these to 2030 because of their pivot info software and IVY, I see them at 70B market cap easily one day."
2021-04-18 19:30:38,wallstreetbets,Oof
2021-04-18 11:14:04,wallstreetbets,I dont know about you guys ... but there was a truck - and it actually ran.  I am unexpectedly surprised.
2021-04-18 10:10:23,wallstreetbets,Oof
2021-04-18 01:36:44,wallstreetbets,40 fucking miles....
2021-04-17 22:36:26,wallstreetbets,What now that the baja thing was a disaster?
2021-04-18 07:15:54,wallstreetbets,"I have 10 shares of this, guess I'm holding lulz"
2021-04-17 20:05:37,wallstreetbets,Inverse this
2021-04-17 22:14:44,wallstreetbets,For anyone who has calls on this for the next 2 weeks look hard at what just happened. The car failed miserably in the San Felipe 250 at just 40 miles and wasted hours. I saw the accident that apparently delayed it or the battery charging. But it ain‚Äôt a good look at all for the stock. I got call for 4/30 with a strike of 10.50 so good luck to all.
2021-04-18 13:42:31,wallstreetbets,"Probably a bit of a drop tomorrow, followed by more steady dropping all week."
2021-04-18 10:11:48,wallstreetbets,Oof
2021-04-18 11:30:13,wallstreetbets,It hurts!!! I def expected more than 40 miles but then again it isn‚Äôt designed to be driving big ass tired like that. That would kill gas mileage too. It‚Äôs gonna hurt Monday
2021-04-17 21:52:58,wallstreetbets,"I agree. I have an obscene amount of SU call options. I think earnings and reopening trade are great catalysts for Canadian oil sands companies. With WTI Breakeven price around =~ $35 for them, these companies have been printing money left and right."
2021-04-17 22:29:15,wallstreetbets,"Oh yea, SU is great also and a guaranteed win. I only chose Cenovus because I believe it has a much higher return potential after the merger."
2021-04-18 02:16:46,wallstreetbets,Put some aside for them next year tax forms hah
2021-04-18 02:18:49,wallstreetbets,Stfu SEC! He‚Äôs insider celebrate the fucking gains jealous mofo
2021-04-18 15:12:11,wallstreetbets,"Once the 17% of shorts will cut their positions and buy them back it will skyrocket, but for the moment there is still a fucking selling pressure. 
I think we have to wait  for the Q1 results the next 6 of Mai to get new fundamentals, if they great enough and particularly Paramount + subscriptions, it could be a new start üöÄ"
2021-04-17 22:17:23,wallstreetbets,God you guys are so fkin awesome üòé
2021-04-17 22:34:17,wallstreetbets,I think one way to avoid DP for Europoors is also to buy GS2C (GME at Frankfurt) instead. Then you are on the more regulated market in Europe.
2021-04-17 22:38:27,wallstreetbets,You could buy GS2C (GME on Frankfurt exchange which is regulated) if you're Europoor.
2021-04-18 13:20:31,wallstreetbets,"Agree, direct to an exchange is better than through a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù default that probably goes to a DP"
2021-04-18 01:01:13,wallstreetbets,"This isn‚Äôt a short. It‚Äôs only the right to buy the 100  shares at the lower price, not the requirement to do so. There is a massive difference between buying a put option and shorting a stock."
2021-04-18 10:45:30,wallstreetbets,There‚Äôs so many other good stock picks. Sell and buy MGNI
2021-04-18 19:48:45,wallstreetbets,"That's amazing, I've been fighting back pains on and off for the past few years. Will be purchasing an entire new bed soon and thinking about giving firm a try for the first time ever. I need back support more than ever."
2021-04-18 17:55:26,wallstreetbets,Pray for us and join us
2021-04-18 10:47:35,wallstreetbets,"Yea, not gonna fix this...

People gotta chill with these expectations"
2021-04-18 02:15:35,wallstreetbets,"Not idiot, but you did have a shit ton on luck too my brew"
