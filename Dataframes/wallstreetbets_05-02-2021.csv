Yea.. the only people who really believe that are on the AMC cult sub. 

There is AMC talk here but its mostly negative. 

Also keep in mind mods remove a lot of stupid posts. Like ""amc to 100k"" or ""AMC is at 9.99 perfect time to buy"". 

AMC sentiment has been dying here since February."

2021-05-02 17:36:43,wallstreetbets,"Been since January, but it's a slow-roll.  Got to buy and hold and let it grow up before back to 2x again \*maybe\* by  EOY but certainly a 10x somewhere down the line.  NOK's 6G plans will be Big Momma in about 3-5 years.  Takes a while to raise monkey babies..if they don't get all freaky in the trees again and fall behind (down) like the last time.  Holding XXX.'s."

2021-05-02 17:27:28,wallstreetbets,"The growth potential as a Telecom Network Equipment Supplier is pretty limited. That’s the reason companies like Ericsson, Nokia, Nortel, Motorola could never make it big. They all need to grow out of Telecom cocoon and have more mainstream offerings. 

My point is you might be able to make some tendies, but it’s not gonna moon with present portfolio."
2021-05-02 19:01:10,wallstreetbets,This is what you get for follow the advice of paper portnoy you little fucker. Stop trying to get saved on a position that’s literally too retarded for even WSB. Have you even looked at the float or are you brain dead
2021-05-02 17:31:46,wallstreetbets,Never said it would...I simply said it is undervalued even at that price

2021-05-02 18:44:51,wallstreetbets,"Praying we make it before expiry so you get the W. I see it as very possible. Whole market trends down, she bucks the trend...whole market up, she consolidates while riding the wave. This feels like the quiet before the storm. Constantly and quietly setting HHs and HLs. This is a classic breakout prep pattern if she continues."

That indicates that if we rapid fire buying at the ask price after loaded up, it will go. With us providing support from loading up prior to coordinated attack, it will move easily just not fast at 1st, once it moves, trend chasers pick up slack, then there is institutional money that sees a turnaround, and finally all of the late bloomers that didn't get the memo or were waiting on sidelines. Please don't forget that we are worldwide as a unit. Many of our brothers and sisters in other countries are with us on this one I am sure"

2021-05-02 18:39:02,wallstreetbets,"I did not. Building larger position. Buying more on down days, less on up days. Triple down when I average down, 10 shares on up days. I'm still up and she hasn't finished yet. I see more room before it forms new base"
2021-05-02 18:34:24,wallstreetbets,Exactly. This is an easy layup. Most people saying otherwise haven't dove in deep enough.
2021-05-02 19:32:25,wallstreetbets,We will party on the moon together!
2021-05-02 19:36:17,wallstreetbets,Apps froze due to having ro clear shares thru clearing house on day 1 of pop. They thought most of us retreated. No one told them apes don't know what retreat means. I averaged down from 6+ down to 4.17. You can still avg down even now and lower the distance to the topside and multiplying your movement.
2021-05-02 18:10:10,wallstreetbets,I lost 50% on Nio in my sleep. Invested the remainder on a NOK dip to average down. I don't panic sell anymore. Panic buying is more fun and lucrative.  I eat their fear and consume the blood in the water. I am a BullShark in ape skin.
2021-05-02 18:06:41,wallstreetbets,Appreciate ur 3mos of support. We shall remember ur sacrifice.

2021-05-02 18:55:26,wallstreetbets,Will look into and figure good buy in if I can may just get a feeler to gauge it.
2021-05-02 19:00:06,wallstreetbets,"Not until you sell. You lost it when you bought the stock. Holding and averaging down are 2 different ways to see the topside with 2 different possible outcomes. But either way the only way to get the money back is to hold on until you're even or green, sell for a minimized loss, play with options,, or build faith in your stock and spread awareness. Don't fall victim to fuel. We will overcome this bullshit and overturn the opinions."

2021-05-02 18:49:52,wallstreetbets,Everyone's strategy is different. I buy what others fear because I believe in my decisions. But I am thankful for the hold. I average up too because I like the value and I love the stock

2021-05-02 17:54:59,wallstreetbets,The real estate itself might be a better money maker I'd suspect if done right. Pretty much infinite leverage if you're careful enough and get the right tenants and help.

2021-05-02 17:34:46,wallstreetbets,“You need to lay OFF the coffee!” - CJ
2021-05-02 19:25:17,wallstreetbets,"If you're poor you'll be lucky to buy one house let alone multiple. Clearly the OP has never bought a house because mortgages take months to process. And he isnt going to get jumbo loan for like 12 houses by when? He doesn't realize you take out A mortgage for the value of the house and nothing more, right? You don't just go in and say I want a 300,000 mortgage plus throw an extra 100k in with no collateral. LoL. 

And your debt to credit ratio is going to get fucked as well as debt to income ratio.

If you're ballin' enough to buy multiple houses it is far cheaper to just skip the houses and use your cash instead of buying money sinks (because closing costs, taxes, insurance, renting ,damages, general repairs)

If you're talking really long term with limited means that then calls for waiting to those ratios to settle and cdit score to settle and rental income reported on 2 years of tax returns to offset mortgage payment to free up that DTI ratio just to buy a second house. What's your timeframe, OP? 15 years?"

2021-05-02 18:15:23,wallstreetbets,None. Zero. Zilch. Absolutely none
2021-05-02 18:00:07,wallstreetbets,It is decidedly so
2021-05-02 19:21:53,wallstreetbets,You gotta take some risks to make money like Citadel did to get those nice tendies.
2021-05-02 17:51:13,wallstreetbets,I know theta gang and WSB dont get along sometimes but I feel like there is much to be gained through cooperation.
2021-05-02 17:42:41,wallstreetbets,dumber then Citadel?
2021-05-02 19:09:54,wallstreetbets,Yes I have family and friends who took advantage of this.  The housing boom despite a global pandemic has allowed people to essentially keep on borrowing for more mortages and loans.  By using the leverage to go all in by investing in a downside that can generate money through premiums I think this is legit.  Worst case scenario I use the premium to pay mortages and eventually housing market will recover enough for me to exit my position.
2021-05-02 17:36:35,wallstreetbets,yes but your using your leverage to essentially invest in your hedge as well.  So as long as you the housing/mortage market does not crash immediately your hedges will keep you float.  Plus since you have so many houses if you get margin called you ll have many houses to hide in.  You could also just naked short housing by borrowing fake houses as well instead of selling options at that is a proven way to make money (According to citadel) to increase your hedging.  Adding a Edit.  also since your paying more taxes you will be helping the economy recover!!
2021-05-02 18:51:03,wallstreetbets,Im bearish on human intelligence so really i cant agree with you
2021-05-02 19:16:36,wallstreetbets,Sorry I guess i was not clear but the initial mortgages you get are all covered by your initial investments and income so those mortgages themselves are safe assuming you dont lose your job/income.   The point of this post was similar to a poor man covered call you can use mortgages in a similar way to cover yourself to sell puts/calls.  Is this case if you sell your calls on a hedging position of your initial investment as long as the housing market does not crash near the beginning of opening your mortgages you can actually make profit leveraging much of your assets and capital no matter which way the market moves.  Since RKT is also a meme stock at the same time I believe this strategy will let you play the volatility in all directions with maximum exposure.  Also trust me Im not high on weed or coffee.
2021-05-02 19:18:06,wallstreetbets,Yes which is why I wanted to capitalize on this situation before it ends.  (I feel like it will some time within 5 years once more people realize how bad the situation is and start bailing) hence why go long/ sell options on things that tend to go opposite housing like gold.
2021-05-02 18:40:51,wallstreetbets,I was thinking the weed... maybe why sundial is out of stock on everything 😂
2021-05-02 17:35:36,wallstreetbets,Everyone be sure to go this spam accounts profile as well and downvote this POS into oblivion

2021-05-02 18:02:44,wallstreetbets,"You can do this with unsecured cash loans too, although in the real estate case what actual rich people do is rent the properties out while using them as asset collateral.

Also doing this with unsecured loans is **hilariously** stupid, but then again, so is OPs idea."
2021-05-02 18:57:43,wallstreetbets,_Bring out yer’ dead!_
2021-05-02 17:41:28,wallstreetbets,"I mean your right you need an sizable collateral investment (basically enough money to covered the loan deposit and some more to pay mortages).  This strategy will basically let you take your money as far as you can off of that initial investment, while also using the leverage to hedge yourself."
2021-05-02 17:44:03,wallstreetbets,I mean are you seeing the current housing market.  Its almost like 2008 there just letting people get mortgages using other mortgages as collateral during a global pandemic.....
2021-05-02 18:02:20,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a wendy's
2021-05-02 17:46:11,wallstreetbets,"Do you mean citadel the bajillion dollar money maker? Yes, vastly more dumb"
2021-05-02 17:44:29,wallstreetbets,"Lol, man, just go put your money into a managed fund at a broker and save yourself the headache. Like how do you even calculate everything to work out correctly"
2021-05-02 19:20:54,wallstreetbets,see if you were to hedge on this there are so many opportunities to make profit like i am doing so in this strategy.
2021-05-02 17:45:27,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-05-02 18:09:25,wallstreetbets,"I am a real estate investor. You need more than the down payment to get a mortgage. You also have to have income that supports the payment. A three year history of income actually. And then you need to have a debt to income ratio that is below 40%. So your plan only works if you rent out each house for  at least 25% over your cost, and more if you want to show income. And have a sizable income that’s been stable for several years"
2021-05-02 19:49:04,wallstreetbets,"I was a real estate investor in 2008 and I still am. Things are very different now. Back then you could do a stated income and be good to go. Just write whatever you wanted your income to be. That doesn’t fly nowadays. The lending standards are much tighter now. That being said, I still do just fine in today’s market and in 2008’s market. It’s just like the stock market: buy the dips, hold when it’s hot like today’s housing market."
2021-05-02 19:32:56,wallstreetbets,"I dont think you understood whom i was talking about when i said bearish. Im sorry, i feel like im just being insulting at this point and i dont like that. I wish you luck bud"
2021-05-02 19:11:32,wallstreetbets,Yes you are correct to get the initial mortgages you need some form of stable income.  Using this strategy will let you get the most out of your initial investment.
2021-05-02 17:15:16,wallstreetbets,Damn didn’t options come after the dpo/ipo? Wasn’t it already tanking at that point

2021-05-02 19:03:48,wallstreetbets,"Their fees are the same as the other major platforms like kraken. Obviously i'm assuming you're using coinbase pro. They both use a volume based price structure that starts at 0.5% fee per trade. They both go down as you increase volume, and they swap places at different amounts of volume. The thing that kills me for kraken is the overnight maker fee which charges you a fee for the length of time your trade is sitting there."

2021-05-02 17:08:13,wallstreetbets,Besides the possible moral issues. Do you even know if the wine is sought after or is it even good? I mean NK is not a traditional wine country and just because its are doesn't mean its good
2021-05-02 18:01:06,wallstreetbets,"Good luck,  you better have some big balls to do this. I live in a small town in China that use to have a company that did tours to North Korea. They also owned a small bar named DMZ, where they would sell beer and wine from North Korea. They would have to bring back (smuggle?!?) the beer and wine themselves to sell at the bar. Normal price for beer was $2.50. This all pretty much stopped when the bar shut down after one of their tour participants (a certain Otto Warmbier) got arrested and later sent back to the USA as a vegetable."

2021-05-02 16:53:06,wallstreetbets,This has serious potential.
2021-05-02 16:36:06,wallstreetbets," P.S. I don't see this directly benefiting Kaesong Koryo Insam or North Korea, they're not allowed to export their wine, nor are companies generally allowed to sell it. The only supply legally exportable is the supply obtained from the rice exchange, when South Korea sent food to NK to fight hunger, and asked for a roughly equal amount of value in return.

If anything it'd mainly benefit the South Koreans who received the wine, since they'd be able to sell it far above market value.

It's metaphorically akin to buying nazi memorabilia from a guy who went around killing and robbing nazis, at least closer to that than buying directly from the nazis."

It doesn't seem to have too much demand yet, but it'd be easy to market especially after the eventual fall of their government.

2021-05-02 18:06:51,wallstreetbets,"Yea it's value would be as a historical collectors item, I just think the existing precedent of the overvaluation of alcohol would cause it to increase in value more than lets say a pamphlet from the DPRK, since it could be sold to alcohol collectors instead of just general history nerds.

I'm not sure what the composition of the alcohol is, the company that sells it in Singapore also happens to be the worlds leading lizard repellent manufacturer, and specializes in insect repellents in general. They're not the same company that manufacturers the wine but it's still a questionable connection.

2021-05-02 18:32:10,wallstreetbets,"To call it wine is likely a mistranslation. Ginseng liquor is delicious. However, this will not likely have much demand outside of Asia / Asian communities, and you can easily get this kind of product at the DPRK restaurants in many Asian capital cities. It is not a unique product, as there are nearly identical ROK ginseng liquors (and similar Chinese ones, as well), but people in the region often pay a premium for DPRK food products; they have a kind of mythology to them both from the restrictedness, perceived low-tech and traditional farming/gathering methods, and perceived lack of industrialization and resultant lack of pollutants. The two big ones, from what I’ve heard, are seafood and ginseng."

However those costs/risks aside, at a large enough scale, I could see margins of 10x within a decade. I mean $500 for a 10 year old giant bottle of 30% NK alcohol is a good deal even if NK doesn't collapse by then. Contrast that to the expected value of Bitcoin or an aggressive index fund and it seems pretty lucrative.

Pretty risky but worth it IMO. I'm talking with a lawyer and supply chain dude in SK for advice, seriously considering it, it'd only cost me 1-2K to invest in a decent quantity, and I can resell them in the short term locally for 2x profit to scale my collection up.

If I'm lucky, I could see myself selling them for $10,000 a bottle in 25 years from now, which is a profit of 200x."

2021-05-02 17:21:05,wallstreetbets,"Prediction for next week:

Overbought as fuck indexes open red in futures

Stupid people panic sell their oversold as fuck growth stocks at market open, but it doesn’t drop more than a couple percent because so many paper hands have been shook out

Rotation into oversold growth stocks begin to occur as big money looks beyond the indexes and finds bargain stocks down more than 70% off their ATH

We get an inverse of last month. Where indexes bleed and growth stocks go up

Even after the bleeding is done, the indexes don’t drop more than 10% because this market doesn’t crash"

2021-05-02 16:29:25,wallstreetbets," 

I propose a general stop to using the phrase ""yolo"".

Investing is an art, sometimes a science, which is focused on the careful allocation of risk units in exchange for reward units. The smart investor understands that he is always taking some sort of risk, even in Treasury bonds. That intelligent investor has made a careful assessment of the expected return and has thought through the risk being ""worth it"".

The ""YOLO"" term undermines the central point of investing. While it is tautological that one only lives once, your capital may die a premature and permanent death. This ""roll the dice"" mentality is amateurish: I have never heard it in 15 years on Wall Street.

Investing can be exciting, and that can be a good thing. But simply searching for thrills is unwise. You can Bloomberg search for stocks with the highest implied volatility and flip coins on binary events and earnings announcements for a living, if you'd like. It doesn't lead to outsized returns.

Last year I made a very big bet on a biotech company called Celladon, earning over $20,0000,000 in my personal account. I was pleased but this was not a ""YOLO"" moment. I thought carefully about the embarrassment and ramifications of LOSING $20,000,000. I researched the situation for months until I felt comfortable I knew more about this company's drug than the company did. I was right and slept sound. No YOLO.

Becoming wealthy is difficult and requires immense patience. This ""yolo"" attitude discourages this perspective. Remember that the world's best fundamental (non-quantitative, non-insider trading) investors are making 15% returns (at best) in the current era. You will need a large starting capital base to become wealthy. Those investors are not simply in stodgy old-line stocks that prevent their returns from being large. They are appropriately (usually inappropriately, actually) measuring the tradeoff of risk units for return units and trying to make as much money as possible. No hedge fund manager would deny themselves a 100% year, but most do as the necessary risk to achieve that kind of return will subject a portfolio to disappearing.

I hope these thoughts are helpful as you pursue your investment careers.

============================================================================= 

Thanks Martin.

Given this is more of a trading sub and less of an investing one, your insights still apply pretty spot on with one notable exception (more on this at the end). The name of the game with trading is capital preservation, or else it's game-over or ""premature and permanent death"" as you put it.

For any given trade there is an expected pay off, and in order for that trade to be executed we need that expected pay off to have a positive value -- otherwise it's not even gambling, it's wasting money. The problem with earnings, or other binary events, is that traders have almost no way to define their risk (ie stops) due to gaps or liquidity issues. For any given trade, a person should understand what the probability of being right is, what the prices are for determining whether they were right or wrong (stops and limits). With those 3 pieces of data, you know whether your expected payoff is positive or negative. It could mean that you have a 1% chance of being right, but have payout odds of 200:1. Or maybe a trade has 60% chance of being right with a 1:1 payout odds. Either one of those trades is a good trade, even if a single instance of it loses money. Because in the long run, that same trade will yield some yachts.

Now the part i disagree with:

>This ""roll the dice"" mentality is amateurish: I have never heard it in 15 years on Wall Street.

I categorically disagree with this. I think it's disingenuous to think that professional traders on Wall Street don't treat this thing as a money making game. It may sound childish that people say they ""go all in"" texas hold 'em style on a given bet, but they're at least calling it how it is. JPM's ""London Whale"" may have said he was ""leveraging corporate assets"" or some fancy bullshit, but he was quite literally pushing out other gamblers at the poker table with his big stack, making money from *credit default swaps* \-- a leveraged hedging instrument! If that's not a casino, I don't know what is.

And as far as your $20 million investment, that was a true YOLO. I don't care what you chose to call it, or what percentage that represents of your capital, that was a ballsy-ass bet (albeit well researched, well thought out, well executed and with very positive expected payout).

Thanks for sharing."

2021-05-02 19:22:00,wallstreetbets,"this sounds horrible. remove all negativity. Talk about the value you bring to the company and say something like: ""I request x as my salary""."
2021-05-02 19:19:43,wallstreetbets,"This is good advice. If they aren't total shit bags, they would want you to be happy coming in. Just explain. Got nothing to lose"

2021-05-02 19:25:04,wallstreetbets,That is the most professional way of saying it. A lot of times you won't get to see the benefits till they send over the benefit before you sign the official papers. You are very much allowed to say that without looking bad.

The gamer claims that Garcia didn't want the gesture to be the subject of a money-making YouTube video. Martin adds that he ""genuinely [wanted] to get the girl a car."" 

Not defending one or the other but if you want to make an out of pure kindness and still trying to profit from it makes it not as a genuine gesture, also I would agree with you (and I still do to some degree) but it's not like the girl was completely unknown before knowing this guy. He probably promised her a life of glamour if she would come life with him in nyc, after a few months of living she was probably trying to collect on those promises"
2021-05-02 18:23:44,wallstreetbets,I mean honestly if I had that ass and was dating a millionaire I'd be expecting more than a corolla.

2021-05-02 17:24:44,wallstreetbets,I mean they are both public figures (if not a list) so they might as well be vague and polite.  It’s like when a CEO quits because a company is going down the shitter and says it’s to “spend more time with family”

I think the problem is not everyone is aware of these assholes who complain about women dressing too revealing while doing the news. I personally have never seen this complaint and as someone in my late twenties I personally would also assume that anyone complaining about that here would be met with pushback for judging the way a woman chooses to dress, given our current cultural climate. 

It sounds like you have a certain situation in mind and are assuming everyone is also aware of this situation so it’s confusing until we fill in the gaps."

2021-05-02 17:53:09,wallstreetbets,"Nah think it was the other way around. She wanted half the money he was making. She did increase his view count a lot but did nothing in developing or creating the content. He wouldn’t do it. Essentially she was completely in it for the money, which was pretty obvious from the start. He knew this and dumped her over it. Good on him. But to be fair he should have known this from the start given how they could barely even communicate at first so clearly wasn’t a connection on how well they got along lol."
2021-05-02 17:59:41,wallstreetbets,I mean wouldn’t the best solution be to start a YouTube channel of her own and then film her getting the car and then post that video on her channel? Maybe the relationship was just toxic?
2021-05-02 18:01:34,wallstreetbets,"At the same time though, if I wanted to give someone something, especially as expensive as a car, and knew I could make the money back by just making a YouTube video about it, I'd absolutely want to do that. If he didn't give her the car because of her refusal, it's a far less genuine offer, feels like the people who give away money in YouTube videos who do it knowing they'll make more than the money back, but I can't blame him for trying to capitalize on the situation he's in."

I hate to break it to you but they don’t hire MAJOR weather-women for their qualifications. She knows she looks good but she’s not being inappropriate."
2021-05-02 18:54:34,wallstreetbets,"She’s probably raking in serious dough from her looks. You expect her to just leave that money on the table to qualify as some ‘non-needy-more-to-her-than-her-looks’ ideal? 

Grow up.
This is the real world and she’s using what her mama gave her to live the life she wants. 

I’m no white knight and I sure as heck wouldn’t pay her or anyone else a dime for “exclusive content” but her using her body to get paid isn’t necessarily a judgment on her character. 

You might be right, but you’re making some massive assumptions based on how far she sticks her ass out for TV."
2021-05-02 19:59:40,wallstreetbets,">she'll be screachy and annoying as fuck with zero substance.

Well, she has a better education than you. She makes more money. She's better at presenting herself. And she does Charity work. Sounds like she's quite a bit higher on the ""relationship material""-scale than you."
2021-05-02 17:10:45,wallstreetbets,Can confirm
2021-05-02 16:23:26,wallstreetbets,I mean her last bf didn’t want to share any of his YouTube revenue so she’s gotta make her own money. If morons would pay me millions a month to see my naked ass I’d go hoe out on onlyfans too 😂
2021-05-02 17:14:02,wallstreetbets,Not everyone in sexwork is interested in the sugardaddy dynamic. Dropping your own income cause of someone you are dating is fairly naive either way.

And right now, I'm on a new streak of 2 days now since I've last watched porn and masturbated to it. It's fucking hard to restrain your body and mind from getting into that habit, but it's worth it.

It's honestly breathtaking how when you start avoiding watching porn and masturbating to it, you can see the severe effects of watching lots and lots of porn and reflect on the impact it has on your brain. You see a new life without porn."

2021-05-02 19:37:11,wallstreetbets,"Substitute ""trans woman"" for ""sex worker"" and tell me how anything you just said makes sense.  Most men absolutely do not want to date sex workers, just like most men don't want to date trans women.  Most men wouldn't want to date women who have like 200k in debt from a previous marriage either, nor would they want to date women with multiple kids with multiple former partners.

It has nothing to do with morality, just general preferences.  You're making it about morality just to virtue signal."

2021-05-02 19:29:56,wallstreetbets,"Yes but given their fundamental value has only significantly increased since 15.69 it is hard to coherently state that. They have grown a lot, people said the exact same thing about bitcoin and tesla a year ago. Literally. Not saying history will be replicated precisely with BNGO but to say you are out just because 'it's already grown a lot' is a fallacy of composition as you are only fixated on one aspect while completely oblivious to the whole entire rabbit hole of information that I have provided for you."
2021-05-02 17:01:30,wallstreetbets,That is a fine opinion. Just remember tesla and many other stocks even remotely having public interest once traded in similar ways. Also I think the 'financials' section of this DD may be illuminating for you.
2021-05-02 19:09:38,wallstreetbets,Care to elaborate?

A lot of people put their money into crypto to hedge Inflation/the Dollar (which is just plain stupid but who cares) that is capital that would have went into gold since inflation is winking at you. Thta may be a huge factor why Gold would be historically undervalued but isn’t actually in modern times because that missing part is allocated in crypto"

I know NK has tons of coal and gold deposits in the mountains, the South American countries have been giving Iran gold for oil they can use to dilute their crude enough for refining, China has been building up their gold reserves, and Russia has a bountiful amount of gold. If it’s going to go x5-10 from where it is now, I think that would be quite an extreme stretch. 50% might be considered more manageable over the next year or two."

2021-05-02 18:54:22,wallstreetbets,"And gold is? 

Gold made sense when it back fiat currency, that’s no longer the case. So my simplified scenario for you is this. 

You own billions in digital currency, you can walk across any boarder you want without anyone having a sniff. 

You own billions in gold, you need a army to guard it. You need a vault from here to space to store it, and god forbidden you wanna transport it..... the shit is heavy as tits.

2021-05-02 14:15:52,wallstreetbets,One would be a fool buying calls when the outs are super low from the deviation. Ya are going to cause the MM options to naked short and bring down the price of the shares. That’s what has been causing the share prices to not stabilize.

They provide liquidity and make money off it – all the while remaining market NEUTRAL. If a market maker has written calls, they won't double down and create a negative delta/bearish position by shorting the stock – they would buy the stock relative to the delta to remain delta neutral and hence hedged against price fluctuations. Market makers aren't the short sellers and bears."
2021-05-02 15:56:27,wallstreetbets,where can I read about outs and deviation brotha' ?
2021-05-02 17:11:20,wallstreetbets,"Basically, high volume of calls could result in a runup leading to the ER, provided the underlying value of the stock reaches ITM or NTM status, as market makers will buy the underlying stock to cover either the underlying stock value to cover the call or cover shorts before the price hikes beyond their short price. 🌈🐻case: if the underlying stock value decreases, we will likely not see this runnup, as there will be no need to cover the options, as they’ll be OTM.

Edit to add: The high call volume could very well be retail investors, in which case there would be very little volatility attached, as they are not utilizing the options as a hedging mechanisms."

2021-05-02 14:45:51,wallstreetbets,"""In securities markets, a market maker is a participant that provides trading services for investors, boosting liquidity in the market. Specifically, market makers will provide bids and offers for a security in addition to its market size. Market makers typically work for large brokerage houses who profit off of the difference between the bid and ask spread.""

""Market makers earn a profit through the spread between the securities bid and offer price. Because market makers bear the risk of covering a given security, which may drop in price, they are compensated for this risk of holding the assets. For example, consider an investor sees that Apple stock has a bid price of $50 and an ask price of $50.10. What this means is that the market maker bought the Apple shares for $50 and is selling them for $50.10, earning a profit of $0.10.""

2021-05-02 14:27:07,wallstreetbets,"Take what out, exactly?"
2021-05-02 16:27:10,wallstreetbets,The float is only 100M. You obviously don't know what you're talking about.
2021-05-02 16:49:17,wallstreetbets,Y
2021-05-02 16:06:07,wallstreetbets,You really don’t know how options work if you can’t distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic value

2021-05-02 15:33:49,wallstreetbets,So calls can be better than just buying whole shares?
2021-05-02 15:26:15,wallstreetbets,Excuse my ignorance but is the process of buying LEAPS just the extension of the timeframe? Or is there a specific way to do it
2021-05-02 14:47:41,wallstreetbets,To each their own. Best of luck.

2021-05-02 16:58:52,wallstreetbets,Your flow is 406.32M with a market cap of 4B. You are welcome.
2021-05-02 16:55:52,wallstreetbets,Yea you might want to do Some DD. It’s embarrassing to say the least.

2021-05-02 15:45:55,wallstreetbets,Better is subjective: greater profits or greater losses. All depends on your risk profile and stock outlook

2021-05-02 15:02:29,wallstreetbets,That is one thing to say when you're demonstrably wrong I guess lmao

2021-05-02 15:25:01,wallstreetbets,"yeah IXIC is reaching all-time high, it is not surprise it needs couples days or weeks of adjustment."
2021-05-02 18:56:13,wallstreetbets,Long month what day?
2021-05-02 14:55:30,wallstreetbets,Smart play. Just read the /NQ FUTURES chart and it seems it's going to head down south for a couple of days.
2021-05-02 16:17:21,wallstreetbets,IB has less wrinkles than the average ape and is displaying this spread weird. It’s a bear spread with long 320s and short 300s. So it’s risk $10k to make $100k if the price drops to 300
2021-05-02 14:48:03,wallstreetbets,Which is why this is a ballsy ass bull play.
2021-05-02 15:08:49,wallstreetbets,"""Sell in May and go away"" is a common quote / advice for markets, going back to when rich people went into summer break and sold of their stocks. Historically from 1950 to 2013, May's performed bad and until today May is a losing month ON AVERAGE. But since 2013 this seems to not be the case anymore (at least on S&P 500). This guys wants to make money by betting that the QQQ Indice is dropping (therefore he bought Puts on it) due to the common perception of May being a negative month."
2021-05-02 14:47:04,wallstreetbets,This is a yolo I have to see how it pans out.

2021-05-02 16:22:07,wallstreetbets,Totally agree
2021-05-02 17:01:51,wallstreetbets,Or why not SQQQ long?
2021-05-02 18:35:22,wallstreetbets,i jack off to that video at least once a week
2021-05-02 17:10:37,wallstreetbets,Ah didn't look carefully he's SHORT a bull spread.  Still retarded but less risky.
2021-05-02 14:53:10,wallstreetbets,Yep hope it works for him but I wouldn’t be surprised to see qqq go under 320 and see him blow his shit up
2021-05-02 15:44:12,wallstreetbets,"He has a short position in puts, not long."
2021-05-02 15:32:26,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-02 17:03:49,wallstreetbets,"Funny you mention it as I was doing the math and SQQQ calls were actually the ""best value"" for a projected 15% correction with current pricing. Compared to QQQ puts, TQQQ puts, and SQQQ calls. Be sure to value shop all three."
2021-05-02 17:21:24,wallstreetbets,"Yea, the IB interface is pretty bad. I happen to have a similar position but it shows up as a bear spread like it should"
2021-05-02 14:56:40,wallstreetbets,I actually think a sideways QQQ is a super reasonable prediction.  Obviously this is risky af but it is basically THE best way to make money if sideways is what happens.
2021-05-02 16:21:47,wallstreetbets,IB is dumb and the UI sucks. He is short a bull spread which is the same as being long a bear spread.
2021-05-02 17:00:22,wallstreetbets,I don't think so. He's short a bull spread.
2021-05-02 16:54:04,wallstreetbets,So it's a put credit spread right. Sold the 320 bought the 300
2021-05-02 17:26:19,wallstreetbets,"How do you compare these? Unless you project the 15% correction in a day, there is no direct way to compare a 15% drop in QQQ vs TQQQ and SQQQ. If the 15% drop occurs over several days, the drop/increase in TQQQ/SQQQ will depend on the path QQQ takes. eg with 3x daily 5% QQQ drops, TQQQ will decrease exposure to manage a constant daily leverage ratio and drop less than 45%. SQQ will increase more than 45%."
2021-05-02 18:05:18,wallstreetbets,"I love their execution and margin rates but their interface, especially spreads are god fucking awful.

Can you even trade spreads outside of their platform?  Like on a simple browser?"
2021-05-02 15:04:02,wallstreetbets,"***Past results is not indicative of future performance.***

May is going to surprise to the upside blowing away all short sellers. Set up your remindme and you'll see that I made the right call"
2021-05-02 15:04:58,wallstreetbets,Iron condors would be better for sideways wouldn’t they?
2021-05-02 17:13:28,wallstreetbets,Oh damn sorry my bad. Thought he was doing a short put spread based on what I could see in the screen. Thanks for the explanation!
2021-05-02 17:45:35,wallstreetbets,I agree the rate of decline will impact the analysis. For my analysis I looked at recent historic price data for all 3 to take relative points during a 10% and 20% correction.
2021-05-02 19:46:47,wallstreetbets,Yes you can. It's easy actually.

2021-05-02 16:33:28,wallstreetbets,"Good luck, I don't think its gonna pay out though. All the upcoming vaccine sales have been priced into the share price considering so many countries have publicly prepaid for them.

2021-05-02 16:33:38,wallstreetbets,because they give out the extra money in the form of dividends to shareholders.
2021-05-02 18:37:29,wallstreetbets,"You have 4.4% under your couch? Cash that in and buy more stock. 

Seriously, do you people not understand how dividend stocks work? PFE stock doesn’t grow because they’re paying out an above average dividend to their shareholders quarterly. The growth isn’t in the share price, it’s in the dividend growth. The stock stays stagnant because any growth is passed on as dividends. Still a much better investment than a saving account"
2021-05-02 13:16:58,wallstreetbets,"Why did you pick July, and not a longer date? PFE barely moved."

2021-05-02 16:55:19,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-02 16:55:02,wallstreetbets,Support for pfizer regarding the vaccine has mostly been accounted for since months and months before mass distribution started in January. If it's going to grow at any point in the next year it will either be consolidating/acquiring other biotechs with covid cures/vaxes or something else they do. Hence why ocgn might not go anywhere much faster either (and they're late to market).
2021-05-02 17:48:45,wallstreetbets,"Pfizer priced their vaccine significantly lower than Moderna, so no"
2021-05-02 13:22:16,wallstreetbets,Because of volume. Later dated options weren’t traded as much. Also this is a short term play. I’ll gonna yolo back into $coin after this.
2021-05-02 15:30:40,wallstreetbets,"I’m very long on BioNTech. Pfizer would have had nothing without them, and if they successfully pivot their mRNA technology into personalised cancer vaccines; they’ll change the world as we know it forever."

2021-05-02 18:30:23,wallstreetbets,"Still 4.4% (.39 cent per share) dividend last time I checked... up 2.6% and that’s even after spinning off viatris. 

Not only is it still a dividend stock, it’s a pretty good one if you ask me"
2021-05-02 15:11:49,wallstreetbets,Is it really a YOLO if you can afford to lose it all and then do it again?? Skeptic.

2021-05-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC Earnings Play UWMC Earnings are coming May 10 [Source](https://www.reddit.com/user/hardyrekshin/draft/6a5199a6-ab5c-11eb-a969-1238ed4de42d)  


The last time UWMC announced earnings was February 2. Back then, the IV was \~100% (Chart Below)

https://preview.redd.it/we9ni67u8qw61.png?width=1114&format=png&auto=webp&s=f698a5cec4403c859879b027a2d242420fbbd39f

As we approach earnings announcement, the IV should increase to \~100% again.  Now Vega--the greek that measures stock jiggle--for 05/21 9C is about 0.007. Multiply Vega by expected increase in IV (0.007 \* 25 = 0.175). So the option price is expected to increase by 0.175 in the run up to earnings.  Current price is 0.33 at the moment. Potential 53% return.   


Positions: None, market's closed. Buying on Monday.   


TL;DR:   


1. Buy 05/21 9C now
2. Sell 05/21 9C May 10 or risk getting IV crushed.

A financial opinion, not financial advice."
2021-05-02 17:14:23,wallstreetbets,You could buy $7.5s and be in a better spot. Far less likely to lose it all.
2021-05-02 12:00:58,wallstreetbets,I got 2000 shares my throbbing member is tingling with anticipation
2021-05-02 12:49:32,wallstreetbets,Ah yes the roulette table of stocks. The earnings play
2021-05-02 12:34:58,wallstreetbets,"I'm not hating on this thread but;
Why are people so positive about this company.  I keep seeing plays posted for the last month and all of has done is bleed. What convinced you now is the time it turns around other than earnings?"
2021-05-02 15:53:27,wallstreetbets,"I did this with NIO last week. However, the stock declined ahead of earnings below my strike so that helped. Dumped it on someone else near the end of the day Thursday. Cha ching."
2021-05-02 16:06:39,wallstreetbets,"I like the play, earnings just bothers me to hold through now a days"
2021-05-02 19:14:00,wallstreetbets,There is 20k+ $15k calls for 5/21 expiry  & over 50k $10 which to me says that MM sitting on tidy profits from ride down & already hedged well

2021-05-02 12:19:17,wallstreetbets,"Good luck, although I think earnings are going to be a NOK-style blowout, with a good chance for a big special dividend. Either way this is a good time to get in"
2021-05-02 14:14:10,wallstreetbets,This stock makes absolutely no sense to me.
2021-05-02 13:56:47,wallstreetbets,I have a 100 5/21 9c that I managed to get for .2 because I bought them at the absolute bottom. They were up over 100% last week but I held out hoping for more.
2021-05-02 13:16:45,wallstreetbets,if it was this easy we'd all be rich.  If you want to go just off the greeks then why not also factor in theta decay which is much more predictive than the assumed IV?  And ofcourse a continued downtrend of the underlying stock can still blow away any IV increase and make these a losing bet.
2021-05-02 13:36:24,wallstreetbets,"Hot damn your right! 

I was planning on buying more shares on Monday if it opens at $8.12 or lower but maybe I'll split the difference and buy some calls as well"

2021-05-02 12:55:07,wallstreetbets,You all should be thankful you got it above 8. Now let's all imagine the real estate market is even more favorable two years from now. That's what it's going to take to push this back into double digits

2021-05-02 14:42:20,wallstreetbets,Is this financial advice?
2021-05-02 17:16:54,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. Definitely has a less risky payoff.  


You could also do the 05/21 10C Vega is 0.004. 25 point increase in IV means increase of 0.10/share. For the turbo Apes only."
2021-05-02 12:35:19,wallstreetbets,"He talks about options pricing *only*. He never said anything about the stock movement, but just that volatility will make the options contracts more valuable.

The stock could plummet, but volatility could still make call contracts worth more if it volatility skyrocketed."
2021-05-02 16:10:28,wallstreetbets,"on a real state stock. before summer starts. on the [shittiest* real state market since 2009](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n394cl/uwmc_earnings_play/gwqafr7/). ""it can't go tits up?""

however, *knowing* how these things usually go, i was already planning to (try to) cash in the increase in volatility exactly as OP suggests.

*poor wording choice, elaborated on linked comment."
2021-05-02 12:47:03,wallstreetbets,Earnings and then possible russel 2k inclusion
2021-05-02 12:49:56,wallstreetbets,Lots of bag holders desperate for anything
2021-05-02 17:32:14,wallstreetbets,It's an options trading play. OP is saying to scoop and dump them before earnings to get that sweet IV.
2021-05-02 13:01:16,wallstreetbets,The housing market is crazy right now and these guys are one of the more active players
2021-05-02 13:15:01,wallstreetbets,"Its went up 1$ over the last week... It's not still bleeding...the last few days it's been consolidating alittle but we will def have some movement this week leading up to ER. If you bought at $10 then yeah I could understand your feelings of ""all it does is bleed"" even though that's false but I have over 6100 shares in the low 7s I'm making $$$."
2021-05-02 15:36:06,wallstreetbets,"I think for those who think there's gonna be a squeeze is overriding the GME squeeze train as if everything is going to be squeeze. They are the ones caught bagholding. I have UWMC because I believe in the fundamentals of the company. If it trades above $9 by earnings, great. If not, that's okay, because this company will only grow from this point on. I don't see any foreseeable risks to this company."
2021-05-02 13:39:07,wallstreetbets,I'm largely indifferent to the company. The price doesn't need to go up for me (better if it does). The volatility needs to go up.
2021-05-02 14:14:16,wallstreetbets,"Lots of desperate bag holders ready to drop their shares and cause a drop at earnings is what I'm hearing. As someone who is long $UWMC I'm not as worried at what it will do at earnings as compared to a year or two from now. Will it spike and remain higher at earnings? Probably not, but I sure as fuck hope so 🤷‍♂️. What I can say though is that UWM is the #2 residential mortgage loan lender behind $RKT, and as of December UWM held a 34% market share. UWM provides it's loans through third party brokers which can further increase their market share over time through increased exposure, as opposed to $RKT which has a direct to consumer approach. (Don't get me wrong, I'm also long $RKT and not hating on their business model). UWM and RKT have both implemented millions in recent years in technology to increase the ease of use to their services and streamline their processes. UWM holds an operating margin of 72% currently and a profit margin of 67% so they have plenty of free cash flow on hand. Median analyst price targets for the next year are at $11/share.

Will $UWMC be added to the Russell 2000 inclusion list this time around? Who knows? Most people seem to think this is the case, but they also thought the same thing last time.

Regardless, the single digit P/E boasted by UWM and RKT is very attractive to me currently and shows lots of room for upside in the future."
2021-05-02 14:28:50,wallstreetbets,I think maybe because it's so beat up from when it was a $10 spac (GHIV)... and it has been heavily shorted
2021-05-02 13:09:14,wallstreetbets,"Not only is the housing market crazy, speculation of market crash increases demand for land, good for the stock."
2021-05-02 13:17:44,wallstreetbets,Home sales have been down since January.  No real reason for this to fly on Q1 earnings.
2021-05-02 12:41:50,wallstreetbets,Look at Vaxart ticker Vxrt. Its squeezing and up 17% on friday
2021-05-02 12:22:03,wallstreetbets,Plan is to sell before earnings. Maybe keep 1/4 of my position (house money)
2021-05-02 15:39:08,wallstreetbets,Are you near the research triangle?

2021-05-02 18:15:33,wallstreetbets,I’m biased to the $7.5s. Mostly because I have 1000 contracts.
2021-05-02 12:57:16,wallstreetbets,"Stock will not plummet it’s only up from here 🚀 stock will 3x this year, while paying a 5% dividend if you get in now."
2021-05-02 18:13:19,wallstreetbets,"How is it the shittiest real estate market? Everyone and their dog has a crap ton of equity, thanks to the unprecedented wave of buyers and no inventory. Refinances are through the roof in the current environment too."
2021-05-02 13:32:20,wallstreetbets,Wasn't it supposed to be included like a month ago?
2021-05-02 13:26:39,wallstreetbets,Yup.  I got burned a few months back by a thread just like this. Never again on this one
2021-05-02 14:16:39,wallstreetbets,"Bag holder here and I agree!  
Although I think long term most under $11 will be fine."
2021-05-02 16:05:22,wallstreetbets,"housing market isn't crazy *per se* but it's about to be due to pent up energy (and a bunch of other factors...). uwmc is a fantastic play for those who are willing to hold, so it's not quite in the spirit of wsb. i do find annoying that these mfs are used to someone mentioning a stock and it blowing up the next day, without accounting for the fact that it's happened a relatively small percentage of times—probably due to the recency bias of meme stonks"
2021-05-02 13:29:01,wallstreetbets,"If you have 6100 shares in the low 7s you timed the dip literally PERFECTLY. And literally bought all at once. Very few people are lucky enough to have done that.

And yes that was pure luck. It was in the “low 7’s” for about 5 mins looking at the charts"
2021-05-02 13:58:14,wallstreetbets,"No, sorry. This stock has been bleeding for 3 months. [just look at the trend.](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Aho7rUTKpjyYRZiM6)

Yes all it does is bleed. It goes up and then continues again. Please don't hold bags. 😅
A short term bump is nothing. It's done this exact thing like 5 times this year."
2021-05-02 13:25:07,wallstreetbets,A market crash does not mean this.
2021-05-02 14:50:26,wallstreetbets,Do you live under a rock? My goodness at least do a google search before you make comments like that
2021-05-02 13:13:52,wallstreetbets,Nah I’m good
2021-05-02 12:54:34,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
2021-05-02 12:55:45,wallstreetbets,Ocgn too
2021-05-02 12:42:28,wallstreetbets,"I will see how it plays for rkt. If the stock crash after the earnings, then I will sell my uwmc before the earnings. IF rkt earnings is a  blow out and the stock rise more, then I'll keep my uwmc shares"
2021-05-02 12:36:25,wallstreetbets,I think people are just reading the title and not reading the part where this is a volatility play...
2021-05-02 16:25:47,wallstreetbets,like 90% of earnings reports plummet the stock. I would sell by may 10th
2021-05-02 13:11:54,wallstreetbets,Real estate is showing signs of slowing down tho
2021-05-02 19:33:49,wallstreetbets,"My opinion.   


Real estate market is bonkers because of the foreclosure and eviction moratorium. Houses that would otherwise been foreclosed on or have tenants evicted are not joining the supply pool.   


Once the foreclosure and eviction moratoriums are lifted, expect a temporary dip in housing prices. I'm building out a cash pile to take advantage."
2021-05-02 18:23:56,wallstreetbets,"anecdotal and ""actual"" evidence. i bought a house in southern california which closed on sep 16th, 2020. a handful of friends have done the same over the past few months. we're all engineers so we like to study shit, plus i've been talking to real state agents, looking at redfin/zillow data, etc... my assessment? volume is low and prices are bonkers due to it. for instance, second homes are selling for the price of main residences in places like Big Bear, CA (a small, seasonal town) due to work from home and such.

anyway. it's an opinion, but an informed one at that.

interest rates are good, but you'd be surprised that due to the weird economics as a result of the pandemic, refinances aren't as ""through the roof"" as they oughta. 

i don't work in real state, so all of this is second-hand information at best.

edit: my bet is that uwmc's Q3 ER will moon the stock at least compared to whatever the fuck they report this month"
2021-05-02 17:29:29,wallstreetbets,They didn't qualify due to SPAC at the time. That time is no longer an issue and the share count available should be good now
2021-05-02 13:55:40,wallstreetbets,when is the russel uplisting?
2021-05-02 16:27:12,wallstreetbets,"Me too.. scaled out of my entire position except for 6x 5/21 $9c. This play sucked. Financials look killer, smashing earnings every quarter, disruptive concept, and here we are at $8. Fucking $8. People say “oh it’s a long hold $20 EoY” but why the fuck wouldn’t the share price reflect that now as opposed to a year from now?"
2021-05-02 17:28:51,wallstreetbets,We all have to suffer through their crying because they picked the absolute peak to jump in lmao
2021-05-02 14:13:13,wallstreetbets,I started at $12 and avg down to 8.50  I like the stock... patience my friends.
2021-05-02 15:46:23,wallstreetbets,It was in the low 7s for a few days. You obviously don't know what your talking about. I'd love to see you post your position since your a uwmc guru.
2021-05-02 14:17:44,wallstreetbets,I bought at 10 originally and was able to average down to 8.00 and am making money now.
2021-05-02 13:32:09,wallstreetbets,Actually I didn't time it perfectly. After I bought in it continued to dip all the way down to 7.18... I did buy in a few large chunks so by the time it had dipped to 7.18 I was already all in. I do agree my position is much better then most that are in... But to say that all the stock does is bleed isn't true. Look at the run up to the last ER. This ER will do the same. Now what happens after ER is a different story. But that's for most stocks. They all dip after ER.
2021-05-02 13:38:27,wallstreetbets,"$7.40 price average. From what I read, I believed the absolute non-transient floor was $7.20, which turned out to just about be the case. Luck of the draw. Not a long hold for me though. This stock goes up and down like clockwork in the manner of RKT."
2021-05-02 15:48:22,wallstreetbets,Look at my posts. Ive posted my position multiple times on uwmcshareholders reddit page
2021-05-02 15:12:29,wallstreetbets,I averaged down to ~$8.  That $1 increase was very welcome for my 1750 shares.
2021-05-02 15:10:19,wallstreetbets,"> It's done this exact thing like 5 times this year.

Which is exactly what the OP is describing, to be fair, a short term IV play to basically make someone else hold the bags anyways, seems risky."
2021-05-02 14:01:08,wallstreetbets,A short term bump of 3 -4 dollars is nothing? What are you smoking man lol im gonna make 15-20k on this stock. And I'll bring you the p and l screenshot. I'm already up 4k.
2021-05-02 13:31:05,wallstreetbets,Speculation of one does.
2021-05-02 16:28:08,wallstreetbets,"The number of homes for sale in March of 2021 was half the number of homes on the market in March of 2020.  What about that says booming home sales and new mortgages?

2021-05-02 19:01:40,wallstreetbets,"I do work in a real estate related field and know several people in the mortgage industry (MLO and UW) who have been so busy over the last 12-18 months, they don’t know which way is up. 

I’ve owned my current house since 2013 in Colorado. Did no cost refinances on it twice in 2020 to lower the rate, with same broker, the second time around it went to $RKT due to an unbeatable rate. 

Zillow is notoriously useless, Redfin is better IMHO as a data source. I also believe we might be seeing a sprinkle of inflation fears. I completely agree volume of available listings is low, but there is no shortage of qualified and willing buyers. As a result, with values having gone up significantly in most markets, refinance transactions have increased significantly."
2021-05-02 17:43:33,wallstreetbets,"Because the smart people know that real estate, and the economy, are not going to maintain the current level of silliness.  Once rates go up and/or people start losing ""stimmies""/jobs, sales are going to drop a lot."

2021-05-02 15:37:43,wallstreetbets,"While I agree that people are willing to pay 10+% on their bids, that’s not exactly what the issue is. The underlying issue is that less supply is hitting the market, and people are willing to pay absurd amounts over market value driving demand sky high. Increasing demand does not drive supply, and a slowing housing market in today’s market is not an issue of demand but one of supply."

2021-05-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLOV EARNINGS ON MAY 17 2021 🍀🏖️ Firstly, mods are 🌈🐻

But more importantly, CLOV is currently priced under $10. I'm hearing many people claim it will be more than double this come the next earnings report on May 17th.

For some quick background - CLOV, or Clover Health Investments, is a healthcare technology company that has been on the rise for quite some time now. They've been increasing their member count substantially and each member has pulled in more profit for the company as time moves forward.

Right now I think that the company is OVERWHELMINGLY UNDERVALUED.

This is not just a 'potential meme' stock, but it is definitely a long-term growth stock with investors in mind.

Right now the company is approaching $10 per share with a prior peak at ~$17.07 back in December, and a low of around ~$7.29 in March (for reference).

The stock appears to hang around the $10 mark generally, but search traffic has been increasing (checked using google trends) and I'm hearing a lot of talk with the next earnings report. Combine this with a higher volatility, this leads me to believe CLOV might be my lucky stock of choice that will bring me to paradise 🏖️

I'm trying to start a mini-discussion here of the potential of CLOV as both a long-term and short-term investment. I think I like the stonk 🍀🍀🍀🍀

Again this is not investing advice, just things I've picked up on in the last few days.

EDIT: I found this on r/CLOV, worth a read through - https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/n36aha/stats_for_04022021_clov_is_trending_some_analysis/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share"

2021-05-02 11:15:46,wallstreetbets,CLOV expanding to other states. Replacing other providers quickly. Almost behind Humana plan. Already beaten down. Crawling from the bottom and this time because of money. They are making millions already. Finance consolidation and we got ourselves a unicorn. Insiders are all over the place. Locked shares for CEO and a potential squeeze. Shorting at these levels is totally risky and with upcoming earnings. This will blow.
2021-05-02 12:25:32,wallstreetbets,Bought a couple $15 calls. And a few $7.50 puts as well lol. Never know how it's going to go with WSB stocks.
2021-05-02 15:31:49,wallstreetbets,CLOV has a good chance at a gamma squeeze. And I don't even know what the hell that is. I just heard that from another 🦍 or 🐍. But let's all buy it Monday 💰💰💰💰
2021-05-02 11:02:45,wallstreetbets,"“The stock appears to hang around the $10 mark generally...”

It went public via a SPAC. Pre-merger, the SPAC traded at $10 per share (as do 99% of all SPACs), so that explains why it had hanged around the $10 mark. This means absolutely nothing in terms of valuation or long-term stock pricing."
2021-05-02 15:15:35,wallstreetbets,SPACs like CLOV usually hold up very well during corrections and chamath is a brilliant investor. I'm okay letting CLOV go sideways another few months then let's load up on far OTM calls and short squeeze the shit out of it XD

2021-05-02 09:22:04,wallstreetbets,Clover Health is a managed care network. They provide Medicare replacement plans and preferred network insurance through partnerships with Healthcare institutions. There are dozens of managed care networks nationally. An example in the southeast is Oscar. This isn't anything revolutionary but Clover is 100% one of the strongest and most rapidly growing.
2021-05-02 10:56:13,wallstreetbets,"CLOV is not undervalued currently. They have terrible margins and high cash burn.

However, this is likely due to claims increasing due to covid, not mismanagement or issues with their business model.

This months earnings could be a turning point in how the company is valued, which would increase share price. The earnings have to show a better margin though."

I think it's obvious in the comments of this post itself.

Regardless how stupid, controversial, good, or bad your plan is - always follow yourself first. There's a reason not everyone here will have their delicious tendies. They follow others too much and because of it they hold themselves back. Filter out the noise and make your own decision! Don't risk more than what you can handle."

Look past the superficial BS"
2021-05-02 09:21:11,wallstreetbets,"So not a good investment? Like mvis isn't good clov isn't good, amc isn't good are we going all in on gme or am I buying supershorts on Monday?"
2021-05-02 13:33:37,wallstreetbets,"Companies like Apple, Facebook, Google etcetera always have pending lawsuits.

I'm not comparing CLOV to any of these giants, I'm just saying that sometimes lawsuits have no effect on the price of the company's stock."

2021-05-02 12:57:35,wallstreetbets,The best way to get burned badly out of ignorance is to ask a bunch of random retarded strangers on the internet to define your position for you.  Do some research.  Learn.  Understand what you're doing.  Don't be lazy or stupid or both.

2021-05-02 14:35:13,wallstreetbets,I recommend you learn more about options before trading them.
2021-05-02 16:50:29,wallstreetbets,Ok but how about now
2021-05-02 14:35:04,wallstreetbets,Goddammit 😭😂
2021-05-02 10:42:56,wallstreetbets,FWIW I think this stock has serious potential beyond meme status. But your post would be strengthened by linking to sources to bolster the argument that earnings will be a catalyst.

2021-05-02 16:31:28,wallstreetbets,"Well, nobody can give you 100%! We have a lot of DDs confirming this thesis! He just doesn't wanna waste people's time recapping here again!

2021-05-02 11:15:39,wallstreetbets,Damn I feel that
2021-05-02 14:37:41,wallstreetbets,So casinos are safer bets for you? I thought this *was* a casino this whole time!

2021-05-02 15:39:39,wallstreetbets,Love that
2021-05-02 14:22:31,wallstreetbets,Or you can play columns for 65% chance for 50% gains. That's what I do. Usually works out well.

2021-05-02 11:10:52,wallstreetbets,"No. The stock price issued for a SPAC (in this case, the $10) has absolutely nothing to do with short term stock price. What affects the short term and long term pricing of a stock is valuation. The SPAC existed before merging with CLOV and the trust that was used to merge with CLOV was based on $10 per share times the number of shares issued in that trust.

Look, I actually own a ton of options on CLOV so I’d love for it to pop. But, it’s disingenuous for you to say it averaged $10 over its lifetime when the majority of its lifetime was as a SPAC issued at $10 per share."
2021-05-02 16:13:27,wallstreetbets,Hope you have like 12p. You would likely need earnings to be atrocious to get CLOV low enough for any puts to print.
2021-05-02 10:56:52,wallstreetbets,I am very fond of this casino. Great food
2021-05-02 16:51:20,wallstreetbets,15 before earnings is very optimistic imo. For the sake of my shares and calls i hope so.
2021-05-02 12:02:35,wallstreetbets,We thinking May 21st calls?
2021-05-02 13:12:21,wallstreetbets,"Because IV crush can be your friend as well as your enemy. Already in the green from the huge volume alone. I don't expect it to hit the strike unless a squeeze happens, for me it doesn't need to."
2021-05-02 16:36:18,wallstreetbets,Bro you just don't know who to trust these days. I picked up 2 $10 may 21 calls the other week though. Could have cashed out with 30% gain but I think it can go higher this week.
2021-05-02 13:34:01,wallstreetbets,"Fuck, you belong here."
2021-05-02 15:02:48,wallstreetbets,"I mean I guess, but it sounds like a lot of real stuff if you read it."

2021-05-02 17:20:47,wallstreetbets,Wtf are you talking about? They are insanely expensive.
2021-05-02 19:55:06,wallstreetbets,"While that may be true his thought process whatever the fuck it was to think ""Yeah. This is it. \*post\*"" is 100% the reason I am getting puts"

2021-05-02 11:12:41,wallstreetbets,I’m in all those tickers minus amc. Took those profits and rolled them into GME long on mvis and relatively small 100 share position and 6 calls for clov I like losing money everywhere
2021-05-02 12:54:51,wallstreetbets,"These are all terrible investments. If you want to trade them because of momentum fine. But there is simply too much money supply for these to be investments. When the fed removes seven trillion from their balance sheet and stops backing the junk bond market, MSB’s, repo’s et cetera liquidity will dry up and the stocks you mention are going to take the biggest hit based on current valuations and access to captial."
2021-05-02 15:56:46,wallstreetbets,Maniac lol
2021-05-02 09:59:42,wallstreetbets,To play it safe just go all in on GME Monday morning.

Personally I’m staying away from CLOV because every time something gets popular on WSB it’s usually time to dump it"
2021-05-02 14:59:05,wallstreetbets,"I can't believe how different the GME crowd is to the real autists in WSB......it's not a compliment this time. 

The man is telling you there is nothing in the article to make you a believer of CLOV and it's just OPs opinion and you get pissed because he points that out.


People need to open up their fuckin eyes up

Good luck with your investing hazardmade"
2021-05-02 14:40:59,wallstreetbets,There are quite a few thorough DDs on CLOV. Also a number of positive articles from other sources pointing to a large rise in the stock.

2021-05-02 09:45:52,wallstreetbets,I guess I'm more focused on the member count as they increased by the thousands and so did the value of each member by another thousand or so. Leads me to believe that CEO must be doing something right at the very least 🙂

2021-05-02 10:28:51,wallstreetbets,"My evidence is: price is prior to anticipated earnings report on the 17th, member count and income per member increased by the thousands, and it is historically low than the average - therefore undervalued.

I'm making the bet that because of those aspects, this stock is undervalued significantly 🙂"

2021-05-02 15:52:07,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. I hoped that a large volume of trade would occur around earnings and 30 calls were very cheap being so far OTM so it didn't take much for things to start going my way.

2021-05-02 10:46:27,wallstreetbets,"You’re wrong about historically low. Look at the whole chart, it’s only been public for about a year. Most of that time has been spent at 10$, so that evidence....isn’t evidence.

Earnings alone doesn’t mean anything, are you expecting good guidance? Earnings beat? What are the earnings projections? Earnings being soon alone is barely a catalyst, especially if you’re talking options and IV crush (imho). Plenty of share prices barely move over earnings.  

You just say their member count went up....but by what? Saying it went up for a relatively new company is meaningless.

I know you didn’t post this as DD, but you can’t say you have ‘evidence’ and then talk about what you just did....that’s not evidence and not a convincing reason to be bullish"
2021-05-02 11:04:20,wallstreetbets,"“Idk if it’s undervalued or not, but I do know OP hasn’t made a convincing argument.”

Yup, lack of evidence isn’t evidence of lack of value, which I already said. 

Lack of evidence is evidence of the lack of a convincing argument though"

2021-05-02 16:36:36,wallstreetbets,Ok no tendies for you next week 😠😠
2021-05-02 10:13:44,wallstreetbets,Lmfao obv joking. I'm in well under $10 before their anticipated earnings report. Solid investment overall.
2021-05-02 10:15:10,wallstreetbets,I think you missed the obvious joke 🐻
2021-05-02 15:24:41,wallstreetbets,my guy!
2021-05-02 11:03:53,wallstreetbets,"It could, but I think if it doesn't surpass $10 it'll hover around $8 instead until we get closer to earnings. I think Monday either serves as a great indication to the potential of the stock OR an opportunity to catch in at lower prices. Some say Monday is 'the day', but ofc that's just the hype. Realistically prices should rise closer to earnings but hey, who knows."
2021-05-02 14:38:11,wallstreetbets,"Now this is gentleman's fight, good luck to you too, even if I'm betting against you. 

🍻"
2021-05-02 16:16:49,wallstreetbets,"Ah, very interesting. I didn’t know it was possible to play options like this but you’re right. If I were to buy high IV contracts, I’d have to be paying someone the higher premium. Good call"
2021-05-02 10:18:18,wallstreetbets,"So anything said on here is bullshit? Dude there's gold or no one would be here, you just have to figure out what's shit and gold. And yes when someone takes the OP and tears it down and explains another angle, yes I'm going to question and try to learn.

I'll get off here and do my DD for hours but, like I said I'm not a pro, I don't know all the terms, I don't know as much as most so I get a feel and go off, does this sound right or wrong and try to invest thustly.

You suggest I just miss the boats go to college or take a class on this shit or something? Learned a lot just from being here and will continue to do such.

You gatekeeping cause ppl ask questions and shit man what a waste of your time, you got anything to contribute to clove discussion? Just from your responses you soj d like a sour fuckin grape."

2021-05-02 10:23:39,wallstreetbets,I know right next thing you know this guy will want me to sell my shares of Phillip Morris International.  Sure probably 200 million Indonesians and chinese are gonna get lung cancer in the next 50 years but man they love the product and I love the stock.
2021-05-02 10:44:59,wallstreetbets,All depends on the ticker in question. I’m not in on CLOV yet but it’s giving off the exact same feel in here that MVIS did before its run. I doubted MVIS for the same reasons you just stated. Sentiment can be more reliable than anything else if you can manage to read it right.
2021-05-02 16:37:25,wallstreetbets,"U Seen any gains posts, BRO?"
2021-05-02 17:38:12,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I usually have to agree with that assessment. The wave hits, and once it does there usually ain't gonna be another one."
2021-05-02 18:23:23,wallstreetbets,"Not true you dotard.
I bought at 400"
2021-05-02 10:55:35,wallstreetbets,It actually has only been public since Jan 2021. It was a spac. I’m sure you know how spacs work but it is false to say Clov has been public for a year. FYI
2021-05-02 10:52:31,wallstreetbets,"Legit I don't care about convincing others. This post was to get more of an idea for myself and to maybe help others put it on their radar.

Btw it was by like a couple thousand if you really must find out by me specifically, but it takes two minutes for you to do a Google search to find out. It's also on their last earnings report. Either way if you decide to hop aboard, I wish you luck! 🥳"
2021-05-02 14:07:51,wallstreetbets,"The reason that it is staying at $10 and will continue to stay at $10 is because the company that underwrote the shares in the offering sold short contracts on a few million shares in case when it IPO'd it tanked. What they are doing now since the internet got a hold of it, is selling their remaining shares to keep the price below 10 so they don't loose out on those contracts. So basically until they run out of ammo this shit is going sideways, it might breakout but it's not gonna stay there. 

I could look all this up again and get all the terminology and company names and make this sound nicer but that's the gist of it. I don't want to waste anymore time on this company.

The reason I know any of this is because I had a guy in my stock group chat bring it up when it was a SPAC a while ago, I hated the guy so much so I wanted find anything I could on this company to talk shit because that's all he did.  It wasn't hard just looked at the website I think. But yeah fuck CLOV. Do your own DD."
2021-05-02 17:37:06,wallstreetbets,"I do not think he/she was presenting evidence.  It's just a food for the thought. He/she have done more than enough already by sharing the infos. I really think everyone of us have to do our own digging before investing a dime. You can come back and share with us your findings,  if you cares as well."

2021-05-02 10:31:56,wallstreetbets,"this isn’t the place to learn to invest, I’m not gatekeeping I’m trying to save you money. 

Your question was basically “what should I invest in, tell me which meme stock to buy guys” so yeah....that’s a stupid question to ask in this sub."
2021-05-02 10:25:32,wallstreetbets,"I think it's definitely worth your time to do DD. Realistically (like anything) there's no telling where this will go. I personally think the earning reports on the 17th are going to be solid, but truthfully nobody knows yet. I think $10 is very undervalued at this point in time, so I made sure I picked up shares before the report and anticipation. People are starting to talk about clove and it's increasing - that I can confirm. Consider this more so a potential for early adopters to this stock before it becomes mainstream (if it even does). Hence the point of wallstreet'bets'. I wish you luck! 😎😎"

But once the whole page is that symbol, it's about a day to get out. The FOMO kicks in right at that point and it can only go down from there."
2021-05-02 13:47:22,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, fundamentals and financials can be amazing, but if the sentiment isn't their the price isn't either."

2021-05-02 19:36:56,wallstreetbets,"Congrats ALL you truly RETARDS. You have succeeded in bullying me about me still being on RH, to the point where I now hate this group, all you retards and the movement itself. You are deplorable, idiots that bully people for having their own opinion & way of doing things. Congrats! I will be selling my shares, taking my smaller than hoped for profits, just to hopefully screw you fucking retards a little in the process. 
I was happy being a part of this group, until I was attacked to no end. Fuck off and I hope you all enjoyed bullying someone for no good reason. This is EXACTLY why I fucking HATE people now, you all suck ass. Fuck off!
Happy to take my profits and stick it all into ETH, at least my money will grow by the day and I won’t get bullied for where I buy or store my ETH (no, it’s not RH, assholes!) FUCK OFF AGAIN!"

2021-05-02 04:29:46,wallstreetbets,You should've given me that money instead. At least that way it won't go straight to Vlad & Kenny's pockets. I would've used it to buy GME shares.
2021-05-02 05:13:20,wallstreetbets,Just wasting your money away lol
2021-05-02 07:48:35,wallstreetbets,Gme options are for retards. Buy the stock dammit
2021-05-02 07:04:41,wallstreetbets,"Monkey does two things wrong with GME, it trades it on RH and buys options vs shares. This is what stops monkey to become an ape."
2021-05-02 03:54:52,wallstreetbets,This isnt a bad move
2021-05-02 03:14:49,wallstreetbets,Give up on GME !
2021-05-02 03:16:22,wallstreetbets,"Gme is too expensive now, why y’all still chasing it 🤦🏻‍♂️ buy idk any other stock that’s not that expensive to get a decent return"
2021-05-02 03:20:11,wallstreetbets,"Buy shares for hype stocks guys! It’s to risky. Game stop holds no value but hype, only ride when it’s up treading and sell and get out after you lock in some gain"

2021-05-02 04:02:53,wallstreetbets,I don’t see what’s wrong with option if expiration is far out and you plan on exercising the calls.
2021-05-02 08:58:48,wallstreetbets,Wow. Shoulda just bought shares. This is why WSB sub sucks. They only allow people to post if they are going to lose money on GME
2021-05-02 09:29:48,wallstreetbets,Buy shares not options. When are people going to learn this lesson for GME
2021-05-02 10:59:11,wallstreetbets,"I will pray for you, despite being an atheist. Because this sure is not smart. You just enriched citadel/blackrock who are selling these options Just buy shares next time."
2021-05-02 17:55:46,wallstreetbets,forgive me for asking but I'm a newbie to all this. What app are you using to buy and hold stocks?
2021-05-02 04:18:52,wallstreetbets,Everything this is why even retards like me. Buy shares. Hope. You made quadtrillios
2021-05-02 06:12:59,wallstreetbets,BUY Silver
2021-05-02 06:53:23,wallstreetbets,"I'm invested in GME via etoro but I'm worried if it does moon they wont payout. Is this a possibility?
What is the best way to by NASDAQ shares from the UK?"
2021-05-02 07:12:32,wallstreetbets,"Wow, this is not only very risky and might not have a real impact to the price unless it went ITM and you exercise. I tip my hat but I'll stick to my actual shares."
2021-05-02 11:18:25,wallstreetbets,"Institutions are hoping to drop it near $30-$45 this week. Watch out and play against it. They only have one day left to short squeeze their floating shares to make back their money. Tomorrow, will be their Rollercoaster. February vibes...."
2021-05-02 11:39:14,wallstreetbets,"I want to put money in the bag, but I don't have much and I am afraid of losing it, do you think you can help me?"
2021-05-02 12:25:17,wallstreetbets,You got balls man. Just buy shares and hold how we apes are doing it 🙌💎🙌
2021-05-02 13:12:28,wallstreetbets,"Maybe I'm just a stupid ape, but why buy options? If you like the stock, buy it. You'll make more money that way."
2021-05-02 13:17:29,wallstreetbets,Shares > options. What could go wrong? You could possibly be feeding hedges fund your money options aren’t helping shares are the play here
2021-05-02 16:01:20,wallstreetbets,Can someone please explain this? I like to learn how does this work please
2021-05-02 16:15:05,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-02 16:27:23,wallstreetbets,Why bother buying shares when there's enough of these morons out purchasing options ....each one of those defeats the purpose of each buy at ask...
2021-05-02 18:44:35,wallstreetbets,Well considering that you're on RH.  Everything can go wrong and you would 100% deserve it

2021-05-02 09:08:41,wallstreetbets,"Unbelievable. Extreme prices. That 197,5 call is absolutely the worst thing I ever seen. Even when it pops, the 177,5 is way much cheaper. It’s just sad because the only reason is that people can not afford the 177,5, what started the rise of the 197,5. These people do not know anything about options. Even when it’s a gamble and it’s a yolo, it is the most stupid option to buy i ever saw in my life."
2021-05-02 09:24:19,wallstreetbets,Stop using robinhood

Price for this call, TDA “ .11 - .08” , Robinhood “ .20-.05”. Rope you on the .05 then charge you .15 and keep the difference.

Edit: not a RH user, going off what others told me. I was incorrect, you are able to set options limit prices. My mistake. Spreads are still insane. Wouldn’t count on them not turning off sell/buy buttons when the crap hits the fans. Just my option though."

While GME is so far removed from fundamentals, with the chart looks, this play actually makes sense to me.

It's a bit risky for my blood but sideways = low IV = lower premiums = more contracts = potentially massive gains.

Hopefully it works out.

I've been burned playing GME options so I can relate to the abusive relationship comment but..

MVIS is probably not going to be a great play for at least a few months. OCGN is doing great now but once India gets a handle on their spike, it's gonna come back down."

2021-05-02 09:29:34,wallstreetbets,"That’s not totally true. RH has just replied to me via email about selling GME positions without consent. Below is their reply. Basically, unless your account is on margin, and it falls below the maintenance amount, you are safe & good. RH will not be selling shares without consent, unless you owe them money for your positions. 


 
Thank you for following up.

We will only sell you out of a position if you leave an account deficit uncovered.
 
 Several things can cause you to have an account deficit including:
Transfer reversals
Fees 
Early assignment on options spreads
Your portfolio value falling below margin maintenance requirements
Having an account deficit does not necessarily mean that you are in a margin call, but you may not be able to open new positions until the deficit is covered. 
 
You can resolve an account deficit by depositing funds or closing positions.
 
For more information on account deficits, please check out our Help Center."

It does idiot. 

If everyone was thinking like this no vote would matter. 

Not only it does matter for a normal election like the US presidential where it would count as only 1 vote/160 000 000 votes but it would matter even more here since your weight would be around 95/25 000 000 of the float (or retail). 

As a matter of fact it's 608 times more than your US presidential vote. In other words imagine 608 persons not voting. 

Lots of counties (and thus states) were lost for less than that in the last  US election."

2021-05-02 16:27:38,wallstreetbets,If it plays out he will be prompted to assistant manager  if not demoted to fry cook.. cash register is already emptied into his RobinHood account so no point in working it anymore
2021-05-02 18:12:55,wallstreetbets,Only tendies he’s seeing are being stuffed into a take out bag.
2021-05-02 18:33:54,wallstreetbets,"I've stopped following GME but I'm guessing the IV is still incredibly high and priced into the options pricing?

It was actually insane how much people were selling heavily OTM calls for at the peak."
2021-05-02 16:49:33,wallstreetbets,Good energy. Cheers mate
2021-05-02 19:48:31,wallstreetbets,"Some of us bought on RH BEFORE they did the AH move of restricting buying. Yes, my 43 shares are still there. But only because Fidelity’s transfer wouldn’t work, after 6 tries I gave up. I’m not on margin with RH, cash only. So, I have nothing for them to close my positions out for. Via email they have said they will not close positions unless it’s a margin account that falls below the maintenance amount, which does not apply to me. I’m good. Nonetheless, assholes here have bullied me about it to the point I’m going to sell my 43 shares tomorrow and put it all into ETH. At least I don’t get beat up, bullied and called names for where I buy & store my ETH from that community. Thanks WSB for being absolute dicks & assholes to a newbie. Much appreciated at this fragile time in my life. Fuckers! I hate peoples, you all suck."

2021-05-02 16:05:14,wallstreetbets,Damn loch Ness monsta!!!
2021-05-02 13:29:29,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. But at that point, why not just buy the shares?  Although this does aid in max pain for a hopeful gamma squeeze.

Edit: just rubbed 2 brain cells together and this won't help anyway with a gamma squeeze because it's on RH, and they like their CFDs."

2021-05-02 12:06:53,wallstreetbets,"Only that they sell at 3pm at market regardless of your limit price and they 100 percent take the spread. I had options expiring at 1.50 on amc, they literally were exactly at break even point and were not moving at all 1.49 to 1.51 all day. They sold them at 1.33. My fault for not knowing they force sell at 3 but nonetheless they took advantage."
2021-05-02 11:16:44,wallstreetbets,Wife uses RH. Approved for lvl 2. No option to limit buy options.
2021-05-02 13:03:39,wallstreetbets,">I have a few friends that way overpaid for some contracts without understanding what’s going on.

Sounds like exactly the kinds of people who should be buying options. Have they considered taking out a second mortgage on their homes for an epic YOLO?"
2021-05-02 11:28:35,wallstreetbets,As said below. Wife uses RH and lvl 2 approved. There is no option to buy options with limits. I use TDA and I also show her even the stock spread differences but she prefers the easy to use.
2021-05-02 15:22:41,wallstreetbets,"I know options of about everyone I know who trade in options. Everyone of them said the same about RH.

2021-05-02 11:04:58,wallstreetbets,"RH literally sold my shares during the initial fiasco. They sold 9 shares at $135 (it was profit but still). I’m on a margin account, yes, but the margin was cleared. I should have owned those shares because I had them for over a week at that point."
2021-05-02 17:36:51,wallstreetbets,Just stop. I'm a one and done person when it comes to fucking with my money.
2021-05-02 04:35:13,wallstreetbets,"It was a joke. Morons keep posting Robinhood screen caps of their GME positions. I'll take the downvotes though, it's funnier this way."

2021-05-02 10:44:14,wallstreetbets,Is it a pain in the ass to do? I've been wanting to consolidate everything into my TD account.
2021-05-02 08:49:29,wallstreetbets,Vanguard is great. Very trusted and offer outstanding customer service. Their UX/UI isn’t the best but their apps are improving in that area.
2021-05-02 09:45:38,wallstreetbets,"Vanguard has a dated UI, but the company is solid. Been around forever and I believe one of the largest institutions. My personal IRA is with them. Wouldn't say trade with them or anything though."

2021-05-02 04:43:08,wallstreetbets,"Yeah same. I bought the calls since I'm unwilling to sell my shares, but for me realizing at this point I could've had ~20 more shares for my expired calls hurts. I also feel, since we know they pay for order flow, it's not too far fetched to guess they could know who *can* afford to exercise their calls."
2021-05-02 16:00:24,wallstreetbets,"Had 500% profits around that time that I didn’t take, let them expire worthless."
2021-05-02 16:06:14,wallstreetbets,That IV crush and theta decay will destroy you on a stock like this. The volatility baked into these options prices all but ensures they will expire worthless

2021-05-02 04:11:40,wallstreetbets,They can... until they need to buy them. Otherwise they just pay you the difference if you profit and sell or give you back less if you sold at a loss. It's basically paper trading with a house keeping track with your money as collateral.

2021-05-02 03:58:07,wallstreetbets,Yep. People don’t seem to realize that until the DTCC passes their plethora of rules that GME will probably be trading sideways.

2021-05-02 09:37:34,wallstreetbets,Wow WSB doesn’t allow you talk about “other” currencies. Regardless RH still stand by “we never did / will refuse people the option to sell”. Que in “other” currencies.
2021-05-02 09:53:53,wallstreetbets,When did they sell shares not bought on margin?
2021-05-02 11:23:18,wallstreetbets,I don’t use RH I use a real broker but RH didn’t sell anyone’s shares that didn’t get margin called. Jeez you people are clueless.
2021-05-02 09:41:28,wallstreetbets,"My email response by them in writing would hold up in a court of law (if needed), so it’s better than a pinky promise. Had Fidelity’s app worked properly, I would’ve transferred. It didn’t, and I’m not willing to risk my shares being held in limbo while a transfer takes place. 
I’m not a RH fan, but I’m not stressing over BS conjecture crap from Reddit army on what they THINK RH MIGHT do."
2021-05-02 17:16:15,wallstreetbets,That’s why you turn off margin account completely...
2021-05-02 17:41:59,wallstreetbets,"Sure, maybe learn how to trade then."

2021-05-02 19:39:21,wallstreetbets,"Damn, lol. Right over my head 🤣"
2021-05-02 04:56:50,wallstreetbets,Because most these contracts are just helping citadel delay the squeeze longer. And they can and are manipulating the price any way so most dont fall ITM

2021-05-02 14:05:03,wallstreetbets,The TD thinkorswim app is great on mobile.
2021-05-02 16:01:15,wallstreetbets,They announced that they're building a proper mobile app since the influx of new accounts transfering over largely trades using an app. Pretty much anything is better than what we have currently.
2021-05-02 11:18:35,wallstreetbets,"Literally just finished rh to fidelity transfer yesterday. 25 shares, started transfer Thursday night. Turns out all my shares on rh were on margin. Fuck em, get out now! P.s. the new fidelity ui is pretty good."
2021-05-02 14:17:48,wallstreetbets,They're A/B testing an updated UI. It serves me the old one but my wife gets the new one. It's a huge improvement.
2021-05-02 09:45:56,wallstreetbets,*day trade
2021-05-02 14:18:09,wallstreetbets,Because the DTCC basically forced them to. Most other brokers did similar.
2021-05-02 05:51:30,wallstreetbets,So what you're telling us is slowly turning into your dad? Welcome home.
2021-05-02 14:45:38,wallstreetbets,"You can sell them at whatever delta you'd like to but the general feeling is that the delta represents the chance the option ends up ITM and the shares get called away so .15 delta = 15% chance your shares will get called away and it didn't sound like this guy wants to actually lose his shares so I figured that was a good suggestion for him.

When I sell CCs I generally try to sell in the .30-.40 delta range for a better premium but I'd be ok with my shares getting called away."
2021-05-02 14:17:02,wallstreetbets,So this guy can snipe your shares obviously
2021-05-02 14:29:56,wallstreetbets,"The idea would be a low chance of filling but still high enough to get a semi decent premium.

Personally I’d be wanting to sell higher delta calls (for higher premiums) but also I have no interest in owning GME so ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)"
2021-05-02 11:26:56,wallstreetbets,Uh *this* is fucking stupid. MMs mostly hedge with shares. They sure as fuck don’t sell $175 calls then buy $180s to “cap their losses.” They cap their losses by being delta neutral as soon as they sell an option.
2021-05-02 03:55:44,wallstreetbets,I prefer videos. I’m a visual learner.

2021-05-02 06:29:06,wallstreetbets,"Jesus, this was a joke that floated around WSB playing off the idea that ""everybody loses money here so RH could actually just keep the difference"", that's not really a thing on the broker that don't explicitly say otherwise. 

RH absolutely buys the shares, or how else do you think the sudden DTCC collateral requirement increase back in January hit them in the first place?

Or we can just make this much simpler: proof?"
2021-05-02 07:16:51,wallstreetbets,Dude. Stop reading paranoid idiots on super stonk. You are woefully misinformed.
2021-05-02 04:29:55,wallstreetbets,So what happens if the moas happens in that scenario?
2021-05-02 07:00:30,wallstreetbets,"If this was really happening, this would be like reverse casino. Since stocks go up on the long term, the edge is on the retail investor's side and all these ""paper trading"" brokers would just go bust in a few months/year depending on the market's momentum.

2021-05-02 04:27:34,wallstreetbets,Damn so they are actually betting that most people will buy high and sell low 😂

2021-05-02 13:39:14,wallstreetbets,"RH, among others, don't actually purchase the stock once you've ""bought"" it.  They allocate money that is reflective of the ""current"" price.  This is called 'contract for difference', or CFDs. So since it's not actually bought, it's not registered.

I'm presuming this is the same for options, but I can be totally wrong this and hope someone corrects me if I am."
2021-05-02 13:25:13,wallstreetbets,We shall soon find out.
2021-05-02 13:56:26,wallstreetbets,"I don't blame you, my fault for waiting but there is no valid explanation for that price. It was way out of the bid and ask range. It was the you are screwed so we are taking some extra money.   It wasn't a huge amount but still irritating"
2021-05-02 11:31:06,wallstreetbets,Can you post a pic of that? Been through the app looking for one. Can’t find it. But only used it a handful of times. Brain to smooth for RH maybe. No problems setting up swings on TDA through.
2021-05-02 14:42:31,wallstreetbets,"In the traditional sense, as in ""poems will be written about this."" Mostly raunchy limericks."
2021-05-02 17:14:41,wallstreetbets,"For real. People get margin called and suddenly they’re like “REEEEE RH SOLD MY SHARES WITHOUT MY CONSENT!!!!!”

2021-05-02 10:06:07,wallstreetbets,"Lol what are you gonna sue them for? That you could have sold at the PEAK? You signed their disclaimer, they reserve the right to sell any of your assets for your protection during periods of volatility. And you signed it with your social security info, it was for sure you. They can remove the buy and sell button as well."
2021-05-02 11:48:24,wallstreetbets,"Were you under a rock when they fucked a lot of people over during the GME explosion by restricting trading etc?

Goddamn there really are suckers out there."
2021-05-02 18:52:36,wallstreetbets,My normal ass fidelity account says I'm doing just fine. I can also move my gains into my other accounts no fees no fucking problem. Learned my lesson.

2021-05-02 06:24:43,wallstreetbets,"You do realize that Citadel the MM and Citadel the HF are different companies right? Even if you wanted to argue and managed to prove that they like to help each other out, they don't share financial books so this still isn't giving money to the Citadel that took over the GME short positions.

Not to mention, these aren't exactly outrageously OTM or anything, so he's creating far more upwards pressure on the price than somebody who spent this money on shares would have. Don't confuse the ""Don't buy $800 OTM calls, that's stupid!"" mantra with ""don't ever buy options"" because the delta you have with ATM (or close to the money) options combined with the 100x leverage means this creates a bigger impact on demand than shares do."
2021-05-02 15:42:27,wallstreetbets,"Ah gotcha, never really knew what Delta signified.  That’s a good breakdown, thank you."
2021-05-02 14:49:36,wallstreetbets,Lol but no. If I gain a 100 share position on GME it would be because I got them through a CSP.
2021-05-02 06:00:47,wallstreetbets,but you read words with your eyes

2021-05-02 04:30:57,wallstreetbets,They halt trading like they did back in January's gamma. Liquidity issue indeed.
2021-05-02 12:24:07,wallstreetbets,Not really. They don't lose money. They just hold your money to generate interest and make money on order flow and information provided to citadel on your trades.

2021-05-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I think the market will see a 30-50% correction by September I'm not going to give you a wall of text that you will probably skim through, instead I'd like to show you 4 graphs that I've studied at length which I feel depict my thesis in shortest amount of time then provide brief explanations

**Thesis-** The stock market is at an unsustainable high valuation and when tracking historical times of similar booms we see a sharp pullback in the years following a squeeze of like magnitude. High speculation coupled with total uncertainty in rate tapering timing will lead to a 30+% correction in the summer of 2021. Retail spending will be at ATH, supply shortages will be at ATH, and inflation levels will spike to 2009-2010 levels.

**Graph #1 - Bank Of America Global Research Sell Side Indicator**\*(this charts buy and sell signals based on 15year averages)\*

[Currently we are less than one point from a sell indication(blue line nearing red line). In history, corrections occur directly following a sell signal call.](https://preview.redd.it/ydij4ihjfmw61.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=f611bea4713da9a7257ba2708dd8a0e9b595960e)

**Graph #2 - VIX/VXV**\*( the VIX is a real-time market index representing the market’s expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days, the lesser know VXV measures implied volatility three months out. One way to look at fear/greed is to use the VIX divided by the VXV: VIX/VXV ratio )\*

[The current VIX/VXV ratio sits at 0.754. When the rate is about this low, vertical blue lines, returns for the S&P500 are often less than stellar. Namely, in 2012 the S&P500 lost 10-14% eventually. In 2015 the index stalled almost a year, adding a mere 3.5%, only to lose nearly 15%. Similarly, in 2016, albeit the pullback was shallow (-5%). In 2017 there were several <0.75 readings, and the market ignored those, gaining almost 20% since the first reading in August 2020 but losing at least 6% since the last <0.75 reading from December 2020. Besides, less low readings, like in 2018 and 2019, can still lead to 20% losses.](https://preview.redd.it/wt3l6uw7imw61.png?width=1553&format=png&auto=webp&s=10d9ec18390ed9a56dfd4908687db964456e330f)

**Graph #3 - Fibonacci Retracement** *(Fibonacci retracement levels are horizontal lines that indicate the possible locations of support and resistance levels. It shows how much of a prior move the price has retraced. The direction of the previous trend is likely to continue. However, the price of the asset usually retraces to one of the ratios listed above before that happens. )*

[The white lines are the resistance levels at 8 month intervals. The 5th sequence of the cycle usually results in the further move to the downside. Following this trend, the 5th wave would happen between july and september 2021.](https://preview.redd.it/u2kxm0abjmw61.png?width=1427&format=png&auto=webp&s=f99b4385974681a7d962fa060f3789f94808a0ef)

**Graph #4- VIX Bollinger Bands** *( Bollinger Bands are curves drawn in and around the price structure usually consisting of a moving average (the middle band), an upper band, and a lower band that answer the question as to whether prices are high or low on a relative basis.* *The narrow bands suggest a period of low volatility. Widening bands suggest an increase in volatility often associated with a trending market environment )*

[In the graph, we see the VIX(Tracks options volatility) at two time periods: 2008 Recession & Present Day. In 2008 we saw the VIX fall through 2009 and into early 2010 as the economy was bailed out. Bollinger bands leveled out at peak separation from top and bottom bands which led to a market sell off shortly after, further lengthening the economic recovery. Following this trend we are in the same cycle as post 2008 recovery, with the markets speculation growing towards a potential catalyst in the form of an interest, tax or wage rate hike.](https://preview.redd.it/mgqaw23ckmw61.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6f3bb372d06e78930b81efa8e1f2ba5067f546f)

**CONCLUSION**: History shows us there is cycles to our financial nature as human beings, analysis shows us the cycle end is nearing. Overvaluation, abundance of cash, and supply restrictions will ultimately lead to a correction in anticipation of coming inflation.

**PREDICTIONS** Federal reserve begins slowing asset purchasing in June and overvalued mid and small cap stocks will sell off to offset heavy weighted holdings( lowers taxes with realized losses), by July 4th news reports on lay offs from material shortages will begin, July and August will be red, and September-December will be a recovery back to 200 day moving averages.

2021-05-02 13:01:22,wallstreetbets,"I am suspicious of all this talk of a stock market drop in Sept ...wall street is always 2 steps ahead.

I mean if you hear the stock market is going to go up a little or be flat for another month or two and then crash in September what will you do? I for one sell much earlier.

The dip, if it is happening will happen in the next 3 - 10 weeks, not September. And by the way, the most poor performing sectors of the past few months and weeks are the ones that will fly."

2021-05-02 03:32:15,wallstreetbets,"Good time to mention all the quantitive easing the world has done (especially the US)? I mean, y’all printed like, 40% of the dollars in existence in the last 12 months which obviously isn’t good for managing future inflation. However, wouldn’t that also mean that extreme valuations aren’t really that high because the dollar is quickly becoming worth less and less? 

I mean, if Apple is worth $2T and that seems high to you, could it not just be that it now takes $2T to be worth c.$1.5T pre-pandemic? From overseas is kinda seems like it’s priced in. 

I suppose the counter argument could be that a LOT of the stimulus went into the market and is tied up. But that would also mean taking profits and crashing the market while also leading to greater cash in circulation, worsening inflation of day-to-day goods, or having inflated valuations and not seeing hyperinflation in the real world

2021-05-02 04:12:18,wallstreetbets,"So this is interesting in theory.  Some flaws though:

&#x200B;

1:  That would represent a historic collapse of the markets in a time which there is more money flowing into the markets than ever

&#x200B;

2:  It also ignores the fact that the IB's have been TRYING to crash the market for 2 months now, but retail has been holding them off at the pass (look at the outflow from IB's - they've been selling like mad, but it keeps getting bought up)

&#x200B;

3:   And it pains me to say it, because this acknowledges the market is currently completely broken, but technicals and oscillators on a market wide level presently don't work because of how much manipulation is going on.

&#x200B;

4:  It ignores the fact that the Fed is willing to print any amount of your great-great-great-grandchildrens' money to keep this economy propped up.

&#x200B;

What you're going to see is a channeled market, not a crashed on."
2021-05-02 04:32:08,wallstreetbets,"Markets can remain retarded longer than autists can remain solvent - just look at that massive spike above the “sell side indicator” in 99-01. It obviously corrected (violently.) 

Cycles of fear and greed are real and fear happens at a much faster rate... all in all nice DD."
2021-05-02 06:29:37,wallstreetbets,All my stocks keep going down for the last months. Youre trying to tell me the market correction hasnt even happened yet?
2021-05-02 06:45:18,wallstreetbets,Small cap and mid cap have already sold off in Feb.
2021-05-02 13:47:17,wallstreetbets,50%? It didn't happen during covid. But I wish I happens so that I can buy some stocks on my shopping list.
2021-05-02 15:26:59,wallstreetbets,"The reason the market will crash/correct is the FED will **begin talkin**g about tapering asset purchases.  My guess is this messaging will begin before the next FOMC meeting in the middle of June.  Once the FED takes the punch bowl away, the party will end.  Better know where the exits are when this happens.  It will be fast and furious.

I'm reducing my margin positions now."
2021-05-02 12:46:54,wallstreetbets,All my stocks have already corrected 50%.  If they go another 50% they will all be zero.
2021-05-02 10:35:36,wallstreetbets,"SPY 350 is -16% dummy

-50% would be lower than the lowest Covid lows"
2021-05-02 13:36:53,wallstreetbets,"For people that expect a crash, answer this question:

Where are people who sell stocks putting their money? You can’t put them in bonds, you can’t put them in savings accounts due to low interest, and you won’t keep it as cash due to inflation risk.

There is no alternative, and won’t be this summer either. 10-20% correction is possible, especially if people de-lever / sell stocks to fund purchases, but a 30%+ drop is exceedingly unlikely."
2021-05-02 05:40:29,wallstreetbets,"The thing for me is every market participant is in.

Every man and his dog is investing in stocks / crypto/ real estate etc.

Look at the volumes, the big players are not buying anymore at these inflated prices.

Once retail stop buying there is nobody left to push the prices higher. 
Then the selling begins.

Just be ready, know what puts to buy on the way down (companies with the highest PE) and calls / stocks on the way up (good companies like apple / visa / Google etc ) 

When will it happen? Nobody knows, could be 2021, 2022 or even 2023 but it’s coming."
2021-05-02 08:20:27,wallstreetbets,"I think it's going to be an invisible crash based on literally no DD.

If the value is the dollar is halved, but the stock market stays flat, we've effectively crashed by 50% but retail investors didn't realize it."
2021-05-02 11:51:33,wallstreetbets,I've setup my long term portfolio for an expected 10% correction within the next 4 months so I hope you end up being correct.

2021-05-02 04:22:12,wallstreetbets,"You are right, market will see a correction later in the year(probably not in the summer) but the reasons are not because markets are overvalued. Market will correct due to a reason which is as of now currently unknown. Remember that markets always require a reason to correct, it doesn't matter what the reason is. The reason isn't important but the behaviour of the correction is far more important.

 I personally do not think the correction will be more than 20-25% so you can pretty forget about a big sized one because markets will never give you another such big opportunity to buy stocks at cheap prices because markets are not stupid. You will get cheaper prices, but not the prices you may still be satisfied with

. Yes anything can happen in markets but I'm gonna go out on a limb and say its almost literally impossible for correction to be 40-50% range unless some country starts a war with usa or something or some huge volcano erupts and kills half of united states or some crazy shit like that."

2021-05-02 03:15:11,wallstreetbets,"As long as the market has FED support, there is no fear of correction. The rate of upside growth may slow, but there is no chance of correction in the current environment.  Additional taxes means more incoming stimulus which will help the market."

2021-05-02 10:46:39,wallstreetbets,"A 30-50% crash?  That'd be worse than the 1929 crash during a period of time when GDP is booming.  

I will say, however, that I do worry about a Japanese style correction due to interest rate hikes though. We are so uncannily similar to Japan during its heydays of its asset bubble it isn't even funny.  Stocks and real estate are way overvalued at the moment.  A lot of pain will come once those rate hikes hit."
2021-05-02 10:08:07,wallstreetbets,Maby a cyber attack will do so. But No I dont think so. This market with QEI will blow off in a couple of years. Then AI will do some magic shit with currencies and a crash will never happen again.
2021-05-02 12:27:57,wallstreetbets,If everything crashes this summer I'll shit in my hand and throw it at you
2021-05-02 13:16:32,wallstreetbets,I think the spike in everyday people investing is going to throw this off.

2021-05-02 04:37:20,wallstreetbets,"Love this. But confirms my bias, so I have to be careful.

You know what’s interesting to me is how everyone says that being long is the contrarian play. Just because everyone comes on fancy CNBC shows and says they think the market should go lower

No, look motherfucker, if the market keeps going up that means being short is the contrarian play. Not to mention, short interest is at all time lows. [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/short-interest-near-record-lows-traders-warn-on-short-squeeze-traps.html) And as you’ve astutely pointed out, VIX is low. Speculation is insane, hubris, comfort at all time high. Poots are cheap. 

Personal position: PTON 07/16 50p and 60p

Some guy on Twitter in response to negative comments on a peloton Bloomberg video: “haha little do they know, they’ll probably own one in 12-18 months.” 🤦‍♂️ look you arrogant prick, that Facebook guy only said that because he knew that Facebook was a world changing social network product. And was completely free."

2021-05-02 03:32:36,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure we have been hearing about ""correction"" since the past year and a half. You are not supposed to time the correction, you are supposed to make enough money before the correction happens, so that when it does, it doesn't matter.


At this rate, the gme squeeze will happen faster than any market correction, and people been talking about gme squeeze happening every week since January"
2021-05-02 12:35:36,wallstreetbets,PLTR will go to $0 if we have another correction lmao

2021-05-02 13:45:27,wallstreetbets,"You'll see corrections. Crashes are a thing of the past. What I want to say is that most crashes involve Wallstreet gambling. They aren't organic events. An organic market event is 9/11 happening or the Covid crash. The uncertainty causes the crash, because of possible extreme circumstances of the event. 

We have no such events now and won't soon, the fed won't let anything fail and we will even see a big infrastructure bill. Corrections are unlikely. Plus we had a Nasdaq correction on a bunch of stuff."
2021-05-02 13:49:22,wallstreetbets,I thought by september we have short squeezed the entire market
2021-05-02 14:14:09,wallstreetbets,Yepyep. Fosho..aye say less my ninja. Dis here ...DISdewhey.
2021-05-02 14:29:25,wallstreetbets,"Ya I don't l like the term correction.  It insinuates something is wrong.  The only times we seen those kinds of moves down are when things get messed up bad.  It takes a major event.  Last one? Start of covid.  Before that? The 2008 crisis.

&#x200B;

You get smaller moves from policy changes,  The market should always in general grow not shrink.  Because the economy is gradually growing.  Hence the market with it.  50% isn't a correction,  It means something catastrophic has happened to trigger it."
2021-05-02 14:39:29,wallstreetbets,"It seems everyone is saying the same thing, Sept go brrrr."

2021-05-02 15:23:18,wallstreetbets,I believe OP because I’ve come to understand the fluidity IMO of a 5/15/25 market correlation of Gold/stocks/real estate.  Replace gold with Bitcoin now.  Seems to me the rich move money in this period.  When I see buy gold on tv now I think to do the opposite.  I may be wrong but WTH do I know.  Maybe we can say - “it’s too big to pop!”
2021-05-02 15:41:14,wallstreetbets,"We also have to take into account that while history is key, we have never really had such behemoths before. 

Im not making any judgements on your post but I have been hearing for like 4 years now that we are in a bubble and the recession is coming the stock market is gonna crash. 

All its done is grow.  I think wealth is currently so centralized that it essentially stabilizes the system. I think I heard 80% of stocks is owned by 20% of people. When it goes down they usually just buy more stocks. 

I think something is gonna have to happen to cause a mass sell off and I just dont know what that could be."
2021-05-02 15:51:04,wallstreetbets,Bruh 30%- 50% is not a correction

Questions:  How many market crash warning signs aren't currently present?   How many warning signs are typically present on a given day?    How much more likely is a 20% correction than the melt down? This is like the Hyperinflation folks,  let's see 10% annualized inflation before we talk about 10% a month before we talk about 10% a day.  Sorry for all the questions but one more, if I give you 100 chips to bet how many would up put on this outcome?"

2021-05-02 18:44:05,wallstreetbets,"let me dumb this down for you apes. The stock market isnt magic math, is emotional stupidity. What people will pay for shit is 100% based on how they feel. everyone is excited now that the world should be going back to not covid fucking everywhere. Excited means willing to pay more. Eventually things will feel normal and reality sets in that you still have to grind to stay alive. That makes people sad. Sad means willing to pay less. Everything else is just trying to trick people into being happy when they should be sad."

2021-05-02 18:54:36,wallstreetbets,"I’ve found this to be the most educational post yet. I partially agree and have had the same projection for about 3 months now. Where I disagree is the extension of the correction being down in the 50% range. I do think a 30% correction is quite possible but I tend to look at the market cycle in a broader sense and i think we may be about at the end of the initial growth part of the greater market cycle. A correction likely will follow but mid cycle will commence following the correction. The Fed, as far as i know, is still arguing the case for transitory inflation and they are still indicating that they will hold their current position but reserve the right to adjust to a sustained inflation in the unlikely event that occurs. I’ve recently braised for fragility.  The market has been frothy for quite some time but companies with strong cash flow and good fundamental valuations who are signaling they will help prop their shares up through buybacks, raised dividends,  and/or repurchasing of their shares, who aren’t as subject to strains in supply as others, and have been around for ages should still perform as they normally do during corrections.  One can always go long the vix too."
2021-05-02 03:38:05,wallstreetbets,I believe the S&P will reach 4600 by September and it will be all downhill by Q4. The big money are only going to buy the transitory inflation bullshit for so long

2021-05-02 10:25:42,wallstreetbets,"Hard to have 30-50% crash when interest rate is 0%, on top of the fear of hyper inflation. 

Assuming you are selling all your investment, where would you put your money? Holding cash is obviously a horrible ideas, 40% of USD was printed in the last 15 months. 

Imo, not only is the stock market going up, properties, cryptos, gold, various commodities are also going up, looks like everyone is trying to hedge against inflation. 

Not an expert though :D"
2021-05-02 10:59:18,wallstreetbets,Show positions or gtfo
2021-05-02 11:06:13,wallstreetbets,"Also: everyone please remember, this should not change your investing strategy but rather be a cause for adjustments versus a complete change. 

I believe that a bearish period is coming, similar to you but I also think that the Dow will end up reaching about 35-36k before that starts happening. 
That being said, it won’t be affecting every industry so there will still be hidden gems, regardless of a bull or bear market. 

Based on past 10 year Dow Jones view looks to be:

Ceiling is absolute max of 38k
Floor is very pessimistically, 27k

Used MACD, RSI, Money Flor Index, Williams, Volume from past 10 years on Dow. 

I am not a financial advisor but I did buy OCGN at .25, Glu at 6-7, GT at 7.31 BUT Canopy at 34, Cisco at 52, AT&T at 35.04 so I both hit and miss. 

My goal is 1-to make fewest mistakes, NOT to avoid them completely, 2-hold long term and buy dips in my personally vetted industries and companies, 3-not frequently sell unless it is markedly overvalued. 

Currently sitting at 24.54% return since 2017/18 with lows hitting -8% and highs of 30% return over my entire account of over 20+ individual stocks, 3 ETFs and 1 mutual fund, to balance my portfolio and hedge some of my bigger risks. 


Be your own financial advisor and never let someone else swing your decision. Use their opinion to bolster your situation and reduce the mistakes in your own investments. Best of luck everyone!"
2021-05-02 12:29:33,wallstreetbets,We see posts like these every week and it hasn't happened yet. Biden has grown the GDP by a record amount and most of the world is still on lockdown. This means it will grow even more. Bullish for at least 5 more years.
2021-05-02 13:33:18,wallstreetbets,You mean a correction of 30-50% increase to where it’s supposed to be right ?

2021-05-02 16:20:03,wallstreetbets,"Anyone can be correct in their thesis and I might be wrong. However, everyone seems to forget that in an inflationary setting, stock prices inflate as well..... I think the current market valuations are a symptom of this. The only catalyst I see occurring that could bring stocks back down is when earnings report fail to meet their growth targets. At the moment with record breaking reports the market has justified the valuations. Once those reverse, the market will too. A broad sell off I believe is highly unlikely, as some sectors will retain high growth rates. For instance, big cap department stores like Costco and Home Depot / Lowe’s. 

In regards to VIX, I would consider it to be very safe levels... take a look at what the average was two years ago, we are not so far off...

Remember folks, timing the correction is very rare."
2021-05-02 16:25:08,wallstreetbets,"Past performance is not an indication of future returns.

we have just dumped 6 trillion into the economy. I wonder if the rules have been changed or moved because of the unusual amount of currency injected. So, perhaps valuations in the past may have also had to contend with a shortage of capital while this time its awash in cash.

Or not. its difficult to establish trust with me when I sense someone is predicting the future as a sure thing."

2021-05-02 11:52:20,wallstreetbets,"Completely agree. 
Higher taxes on the rich = less Job growth.
Rates going up = slows down growth.
Inflation will trigger more savings and less spending.
Widespread speculation and borrowing on margins is very bad. 
The best thing to do is to understand that the assets you own are inflated and you can sell until the market crashes, then buy them up again. 
Obviously, only buy high cash flowing assets with good drivers."

2021-05-02 04:27:42,wallstreetbets,highly likely
2021-05-02 04:29:56,wallstreetbets,"Here’s a case against: Given the 1.6% GDP Growth in Q1 2021 and the fact that the risk-free rates are under 2%, we’re likely in for the grande finale of the greatest bull market in history. The single best predictor of the stock market is the fed model and if the US GDP actually grows 6.5% while risk free rates stay around 2% we will likely see a SPY $700 end of Q1 2022. 

The major risk that all of the big players are evaluating right now is inflation. We’ve seen a lot of companies like P&G coming out recently talking about an increase in prices. Amazon recently purchased enough inventory to max out their warehouses. The market is up and down now because everyone is evaluating whether this is transitory or not. If this increase in prices is proven to last only 1-2 months, you’ll see the market run up at a rate we’ve never seen before. SPY $700 is a realistic target if this happens."
2021-05-02 04:31:24,wallstreetbets,"I think it may come sooner due to the spread of mutated variants of COVID from India. It has yet to hit us but it’s only a matter of time, many that flees from India will carry that variant.

But, we also have the money printers ready that will prop up the market. The money printed will go into the stock market again. That’s why we see inflation in the stock market, but not that much inflation in terms of CPI/ common goods."

If we are seeing unprecedented inflation in US dollar value, than the recent uptick in there markets IS the correction in valuation.

I'm other words, consider that a stock currently trading at $150, that was $100 at beginning of 2020 could have no increase in cost given 50% increase in inflation over that time.

If this hyper inflation exists, owning ANYTHING, but cash, is a good move.

SOOO, if you think the market will correct, ander it is inflated beyond the inflation of the currency, don't sorry idly by with cash on the sidelines waiting to buy the dip, and don't lock your cash in an interest bearing account that will underperform inflation growth.

TLDR; OP is likely correct that correction is coming, but don't get caught holding ""depreciating"" cash either..."

I’ve had to build more DCFs in the last 4 months than normal and I noticed that almost every single time, the perpetuity growth model was fucking necrotic compared to current prices & the valuations reached using EV/EBITDA & EV/Sales multiples based on current levels. 

The second discount rates start going back up, these valuations are in for a rude awakening — but even before that, if you’re not incorporating a hike in interest rates for 5 or 10 year DCFs or multiples contracting back to historical levels, your shit’s probably overvalued."

2021-05-02 16:49:44,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-05-02 16:51:20,wallstreetbets,My bet is we don't see a massive correction like what we saw last year until S&P hits 7000+.  Bond yields are still ridiculously low and this creates a risk on appetite because big $$$ has no where else to go except equities.  It might be risky  but you can still probably get 10% in 10 years compared to 1.6% from a 10 year note.  IMO we keep this trend until bond yields spike way up.

2021-05-02 17:02:30,wallstreetbets,"Smooth brian analysis, magical charts and harry potter spell sequences.  No mention of the increase in the M1 and inflation for hard assets which is driver number one of the increase in prices.  Remember people just cuz your stocks are going up doesn't mean your getting wealthier, if your not beating the M1 then your losing real value.  Driver number 2, The fed has stated is does not intend to slow purchasing of any assets.  Its more likely that as bond yield's near 3+% that they will increase purchases as a yield control measure which will drive stocks even higher. Though I do see growth moving sideways for a while until this happens.  Were in a bull market and the money printers are at full speed, mathematically we are in a debt cycle and austerity is not an option.  Neither is taxing the rich since we would never be able to get enough to make a meaningful impact in the national debt."
2021-05-02 17:02:32,wallstreetbets,"Which market? Dow, S&P, or NAS. I would doubt either of those markets corrects that much but the NAS has a really good chance of a 10-15 percent correction starting in the next week or two."

June fed presser will be: “we’re certainly trending in the right direction but until the economy maintains this level of robustness for a considerable amount of time it’s too early to talk about tapering.”

Then September will be: “okay media, we finally are going to mention that we’re considering tapering to gauge the market reaction. The market is a little child so anything less than a 5% drop is just a healthy tantrum and buying opportunity.”

I’m not willing to even venture a guess at this point when tapering will happen. $10 trillion balance sheet go brrrrrr."

2021-05-02 18:25:41,wallstreetbets,VIX at $50???? Seems like an aggressive call considering some type of catalyst would been needed for a short term sell off. I envision small sells offs over time as earnings and revenue never will justify current valuations. We've seen some of that over the last two weeks. Where companies crushed earnings but the stock dropped anyways.
2021-05-02 18:26:21,wallstreetbets,"50% isn't a correction. It's a full blown recession. Coming out of the man made covid recession means the market will hold it's value, and keep rising, until people on mass start doing something stupid that will tank the entire economy, or new technology destroys too many jobs in too short a time frame. Until something like that comes along, I'm staying put."

What's the chance the next spin will come up black?

Right - 50/50.   The past events have nothing to do with the next event.   This is why technical analysis is bunk.

2021-05-02 08:21:37,wallstreetbets,"A quote believed to be from Ralph Wagoner, as recalled by William Bernstein:

> ""He likens the market to an excitable dog on a very long leash in New York City, darting randomly in every direction. The dog's owner is walking from Columbus Circle, through Central Park, to the Metropolitan Museum. At any one moment, there is no predicting which way the pooch will lurch. But in the long run, you know he's heading northeast at an average speed of three miles per hour. What is astonishing is that almost all of the market players, big and small, seem to have their eye on the dog, and not the owner.""

It’s an argument in favour of index investing. The only way that loses is if capitalism ends, which hasn’t happened in hundreds of years, never mind the last 100."

An unprecedented recovery has already been priced in, hence the extraordinarily optimistic valuations. The market is maintaining these high valuations because of fed purchasing and historic (like 1928) amounts of cheap margin. A trigger like fed purchasing tapering off or say the collapse of commercial MBSs à la 2008 (just as fraudulent BTW) or business loan backed securities/bonds taking a dump would create a cascade of margin calls bringing valuations back to reality. 

The alternative of course is that valuations are real, because the dollar has devalued and we're stumbling into inflation/stagflation, an idea supported by skyrocketing commodities prices. However, a  bubble near the pop looks and feels a lot like inflation. Only time will tell, just keep riding the bull wave and dont forget to hedge."

Https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm

Look at that in desktop view.  Excess mortality is plunging.  Covid 19 killed by in large a bunch of old people who were going to die anyways within the next few years.   You won't hardly even be able to tell we had a pandemic in 20 years.

Everyone went stupid and we blew the economy for basically nothing.  We murdered the elderly with stupid cloth mask recommendation when they had no business going out.  We had no control over a highly contagious respiratory disease.  And now we got the number 1 antivaxxer in the country double masking up and causing vaccine hesitancy which will kill more people.

2021-05-02 14:58:34,wallstreetbets,"1). Markets crash when money thrown into it is at or near all time highs. The more removed we are from fundamentals of valuation the greater the reversion to the mean.

2). IBs aren’t trying to crash the market and Retail isn’t doing dick, this belief is the final stage of retardation that this casino market will endure. Shit is being bought up by passive indexes that are structured to just buy the same stocks regardless of valuation for retirement funds. The rest I assume, is getting bought up by some desperate firms that are in an Archegos/bill Hwang scenario. Which leads to the next bullet.

3). Record levels of margin debt as a percentage to S&P 500 will solve this manipulation especially now with the SLR exemption gone, taxes due second week of may, reopening, yields crushing upwards and inflation destroying growth and speculative stocks.

4). The fed printer bro magic I believe is largely a con narrative started to get more money to the craps table of the stock market. It’s perfect cover to justify the conditions being seen since last year and make a little sense when you start considering the amount of options gaming, swaps and leverage used in this market.

People (and by that I mean the media) really aren’t putting enough spotlight on Archegos, greensil, and the potential liquidity crisis of GME."

It seems our government is artificially keeping the bond market from crashing by buying back bonds.

If inflation sky rockets our government will have no choice but to increase rates even though Powell keeps saying they won’t.

People were not using masks or social distancing, and the country's officials decided to export a mass majority of their vaccines. The reason India is suffering right now is not necessarily due to stronger variants, it's just that they had their guard down. It's an interesting listen if you have the time.  

However, I share your pessimism and I too believe we are headed for a market correction. Your first sentence is everything that I am concerned about as well, and when the economy turns ugly, things will be catastrophic.

That being said, every day I drive by a new boarded up business.

2021-05-02 05:26:09,wallstreetbets,Other pandemics didn’t have vaccines so soon. But out of control places like India and Brazil are the real threat due to mutations breeding there
2021-05-02 09:04:48,wallstreetbets,"Does new technology never get taken into account for this instances? The vaccines were created in less than a year. They are developed using new technology called mRNA that can adapt to changes in the virus. Sure there might need to be boosters but if more people get vaccinated then there shouldn’t be a massive lock down again.

Obviously it’s more of an issue to get people vaccinated as everyone is hesitant to get it. This is still much different than pandemics from a 100 years ago. Just curious why everyone keeps going doomsday on this all the time. If we react to everything like we did hundreds of years ago we might as well go back to the Stone Age correct?"
2021-05-02 10:42:38,wallstreetbets,Influenza was before and after the 1918 pandemic. The pandemic was birthed in the trenches.
2021-05-02 12:22:02,wallstreetbets,"So tech goes to the moon again, and the reopening companies tank, with a overall net natural impact. Basically a reverse of the trend from Feb and March. We know how and who benefits from lockdowns etc. today that we did not in March 2020."
2021-05-02 05:17:56,wallstreetbets,"I’m with you bro. Another variant can easily take us back to March 2020! Looking at the data, most recent all three variants ( South African, Brazilian & Indian) are found in UK & EUROPE. So far vaccines are holding the ground! No upswing. UK is doing much better reported 6 deaths yesterday & the economy is in full throttle. But we can’t be sure yet Covid is over, this m***f**** changes in every few months!"
2021-05-02 13:18:07,wallstreetbets,Uh you realize the vaccines work against the Indian variant right? Oh of course not becuase you're a dumbass doomer farming karma here.
2021-05-02 06:52:39,wallstreetbets,"no, it’s still very much an if."
2021-05-02 11:45:51,wallstreetbets,"Most people aren't vaccinated in India but otherwise yes variants could derail us.

Over time viruses typically mutate towards less deadly but we could still get screwed short term"
2021-05-02 13:01:27,wallstreetbets,"It took two days to make the first vaccine by morderna, they already have varient vaccine boosters in testing.

It'll be a long road but it's not gonna get as bad as it was last year unless it becomes more deadly which isn't likely (but still possible)"
2021-05-02 14:28:31,wallstreetbets,"So like 2020, another 15% downturn for a month or so follow by 8 months worth of unprecedented bullrun?"
2021-05-02 04:15:01,wallstreetbets,"For now, Tesla is mostly cars. Maybe its a fantastic robotics/AI/energy company as well, but all of that has already been priced into the current valuation. 
If everything magically falls into place for them in the next 3 years they will be at fair value. All it takes is one missed step and the sentiment will turn just as quick as it came."
2021-05-02 03:53:51,wallstreetbets,"My apologies, you have better understanding than me! Best of luck"
2021-05-02 11:00:12,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is a car company whose non-fucky revenues (a GAAP metric meaning revenue before crypto, tax credits and casino winnings) is down 2% quarter over quarter and they trade at 1000 p/e. Valued at the same as the entire sector put together lol - they had a really bad ER, and IMO Elon just holds crypto so he can synthesize an earnings beat whenever he wants by selling some."
2021-05-02 11:05:46,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think the big money sees crypto the way you think. The GBTC premium is still almost -20%, they’ve suspended creation, started buying back shares and nothing is moving it. That market will crash harder than any other just as it moved in sync with equities last year."
2021-05-02 08:58:39,wallstreetbets,"The way I see it, if I continue to DCA into US stocks I’m going to win over the long run (assuming my own currency retains relative strength). Little worried about my current positions, but hopefully the price growth will outpace the FX impact 🤔"
2021-05-02 10:54:47,wallstreetbets,I’d argue it will. It needs to keep the same value vs goods and services. It doesn’t matter about other currencies imo. Can’t print apples like you print money.

Asked when the Fed would taper, Powell would not give any calendar date for a shift in policy — saying it would depend on the state of the economy.

The Fed has said it won’t taper the size of the purchases until it has seen “substantial further progress” on its goals of maximum employment and stable 2% average inflation. It has said it would not raise interest rates until the economy is back to full employment, inflation has reached 2% and is on track to be moderately above 2% for some time."

2021-05-02 04:29:43,wallstreetbets,"2001 was a targeted correction that only significantly affected one sector.

2008 was a broad correction that could not be solved by QE - only completely wiping out debt could have stopped that.

Our problem right now is neither debt (well, I mean...it is, but nobody believes it) nor sector-specific froth."
2021-05-02 09:13:32,wallstreetbets,They did stop the 08 crash.  They just turned on the QE late.  As soon as they did we got the decade bull run.  This time they started the QE much faster hence the faster turn around.
2021-05-02 12:10:15,wallstreetbets,"We're in an entirely new stage of monetary policy from the Fed, 2001 and 2008 aren't applicable in this environment due to the endless QE and balance sheet expansion"

No TA would've accurately predicted the March Covid Crash and Recovery without having a million false Bail signals in  every month of every year prior.

There's not much point thinking about the reason as reasons do not really matter, its how the markets react to the reason that matters. Also its possible that the reasons may only become evident after the correction has ended and market is recovering or towards the end of the correction. So people will just keep speculating over the reasons during the correction."

I'm positioned to do well in growth or decline, but can't grow as well in heavy growth and won't recover as much in heavy decline. So for me something like a 10-15% correction is ideal. But if the market doesn't decline and continues to do well I still benefit just not as much as if I didn't have hedges in place. I lose if the market trades flat through Sept."

Usable land is a great asset to hold in an economic crisis or hyperinflation. What happens when that land demand declines, say with a shift in interest rates or people trying to cash out of the bubble? To compound this, some are also saying there is a bubble caused by home values in flood zones not being properly adjusted for increasing flood damage risk as the climate changes: https://time.com/5953380/climate-housing-crisis/. I could definitely be wrong, my perspective isn't well-cited, I'm trying to put the pieces together, and I dunno how this bubble I believe exists will impact the rest of the market. I definitely have no intention in buying property until what I'm seeing pops. I see a lot of reasons why homes are not worth what they are selling for at the moment. I see problems both in expectations of emergence from the pandemic being dashed by more bad news and the hit that could take on the market if the fabled ""re-opening"" is delayed. I see problems in what happens after we actually do emerge from the pandemic and as the federal reserve shifts fire, maybe raises interest rates, and the focus shifts away from the coronavirus and sentiments become more dominated by other more problematic issues in our financial system that have kind of festered.

My thinking is that just because there is an obvious culpable human element  to their coronavirus resurgence (that is certainly not unique to India by any stretch) does not mean there are not multiple variables at play. I think we would be very unwise to dismiss the idea of variants and mutations (that we already know exist and are dangerous exacerbating) coronavirus resurgences. Attributing a second wave to demonstrable human error is very easy, but attributing it to more dangerous strains of the virus requires more time, data, and research efforts and resources. The truth of the matter is the truth of the matter, whatever that may be. Part of getting to that truth is recognizing our collective biases due to imperfect availability of information. We need to holistically assess our known unknowns as well as our unknown unknowns when we’re looking at this. 

Thousands in India are dying, overwhelming their medical infrastructure. Their bodies are being burned. If there are specific more dangerous strains playing a significant factor in India, do we really think the necessary data for that determination has been collected, cleaned, and properly analyzed. Maybe if this was small outbreaks in Germany or Japan, but this is India, with India’s healthcare system, and it is an absolutely staggering number of cases. 

I’d strongly advise against any strong optimism about where humanity is at with coronavirus at the moment, and assuming the global economy will be back at 100% and fully open by July is uhh… well, I don’t think that will be the case."

Definately. But it also gotten worse in other aspects. World Population was around 2 billion. There wasnt even 1% of todays air travel going on (if even) and how fast all those variants like the brazilian, uk variations spread around the globe etc.

You just also dont include human behaviour into your equation. How many wont get vaccinated, how many dont even want to wear masks and how many still believe this is all a hoax for global domination.

The sad thing is, many deaths in India could be easily prevented if not for the collapse of the HCS and lack of oxygen, because the sheer amount of infected.

And this goes for every country. Im not really worried about more deadly but more countagious and even if its mild symptoms that need treatment, the problem becomes ""need treatment"".

2021-05-02 05:00:52,wallstreetbets,"But now you're trying to time the market. If you get in on that +5% and it turns out to be a bounce before a 30% correction, you're sol. If you waited for the correction, saving up capital for a bigger buy-in, you've missed out on the gains leading up to the correction that would have offset your loss. If you didn't buy in at +5% because your expecting a 30%-50% correction that isn't coming, you've just missed out on all the best days.

2021-05-02 05:37:48,wallstreetbets,"Its only been 5 months, but I'm a comp sci grad student (but originally engineer so I'm less experienced at in terms of years coding) so I didn't have to start from scratch learning to code which was nice.  Overall I found the process mostly fun, a bit dissapointing because you have high hopes thinking there is so much cash to exploit with all the up and down volatility, and at times super frustrating when you're script hits some weird market order flaw is stuck in a loop trying to sell for 5 hours.

Its been great investment in terms of improving my coding, and forced me to look at the market at all sorts of different time frames to really give me a better sense of awareness of where a market is at any point in time (e.g. I was trying to buy/sell on an hourly basis, but learned the hard way how you can be looking for a 0.5% gain when you are in the middle of an overbought 2 day run that is about to drop 4%)

I just used python which is very user friendly and can do just about anything.  My cousin who does market making for a living gave me the great advice of ""the skills you learn trying to algotrade will probably outweigh the money you make"".  but, I've definitely improved drastically in the last 5 months so hopefully I can continue to improve the bots, implement some machine learning techniques to pick out better strats, look into Stocks and use a wider array of parameters to make neural networks (with cryptos you're kinda limited to trends, volume, and a little bit of sentiment analysis maybe)

So yeah, def go for it if you're curious and have the free time.  It'll improve you're coding and you're trading skills simultaneously.  Make all sorts of custom graphs that let you see the market in ways others can't is one of my favorite tools to start.  Def Backtest every technical trading strat you can think of, and prepare to be dissapointed, gives a good does of reality with all these scam trading gurus popping up."

Same people probably said two years ago that ""The CCP won't take over Hong Kong. It just wouldn't make any sense.""  


Currently, about 328k new Bitcoins are mined a year. At a little over $60k each, that's roughly $20 billion in value. China isn't spending the energy of a medium-size country (not to mention the mining infrastructure) mining it just to clear a few billion a year. I guarantee you they have something much bigger in mind. I expect it began with the recent release of their e-yuan, which I'm sure they'd just love to cram down the world's throat as the dominant digital currency. Crypto stands in the way of that happening."

I could be mistaken, but how I heard it, they were basically pissing away the energy of a smallish to medium-sized country anyway, due to poor balancing of the power grid.

I think the main problem standing in the way of a 51% attack on Bitcoin is that it would be blatantly obvious who's behind it, and therefore very obvious who people should target if they want to get the system working properly again. Maybe in the worst case they could break the system and keep it down long enough to cause significant problems. There's no possible world in which that leads to the rise of e-yuan.

2021-05-02 11:17:19,wallstreetbets,Here’s where you’re dead wrong. In Oregon for example you can collect $300 per week in federal unemployment. Then you can collect 300 and state unemployment. You can also earn money up to that $300 without losing any benefits. So that means you can make up to $900 per week. That equals over $22 Per hour. Then you can qualify if you’re a business for a PPP loan that could get you somewhere Upwards of tens of thousands Because the PPP is based on gross profits not net. Then there are other programs. So your real wage could be somewhere equal to over 30 or more dollars an hour.
2021-05-02 15:52:45,wallstreetbets,Stimmy checks and unemployment are inflated. There's people in this thread making $60k without holding down a job. Why is the government (us) paying for that when they can just get a job and be productive?

2021-05-02 07:28:05,wallstreetbets,"Yes, most people with even a little bit of reasoning skills have had it figured out for awhile. Since you've increased wages and have been able to fill positions as a result, it seems that you have figured it out too, but are pretending(?) there's no correlation between wage and a willingness to work for a company for some weird reason. Or maybe you're just kinda dumb, I don't know! But I'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt.

Again, why should they be competing against the government paying people to stay home in the first place? Unemployment should be enough to ensure people don't starve to death, it should not be enough to tempt people to not work as long as possible.

The cost of labor is just supply/demand, but when the government massively fucks the supply and the demand goes way up how are normal businesses supposed to compete when you have the largest monopoly in the world fucking with shit?"

>Then why should the govt provide PPP assistance?

I never said they should. They also shouldn't shut down businesses either though.

> If you cannot pay more than govt unemployment, maybe your business chops are not that great or you don't know how to run a business.

People on unemployment in my area are making more than I am with an MS and a technical scientific job. They're making way more than my wife is as a teacher. Why do they need to be paying out so much? Are school districts supposed to just give up and shut down because they're not paying teachers enough in your opinion?  

Basically, why is the government paying people to stay home and live comfortably? The point of unemployment is to keep people from starving while they find another job, not to keep them unemployed indefinitely."

2021-05-01 23:28:46,wallstreetbets,"A month out on the option chain. For example, today is May 1st. So Monday at open I would go look at PLTR price, Lets say its $24. So, if I wanted to take advantage of the premium while locking in a lower price, I would go look at the June 4th puts on PLTR. June 4 2021 $24 Puts are trading around $225/contract right now.

So if you sold a Cash Secured Put at $24 for June 4th, and it gets exercised by the holder, you would have effectively bought 100 shares for $21.75 (24-2.25). Then, you can do the exact same thing again, but with calls, because now you own the shares. 

The goal is not to constantly have your options get exercised, but to collect premium. Selling puts in general tho is a solid way to start a position in a stock, assuming they're cash secured.

But their growth outlook for the next few years is just not that exciting so when people say “why are they undervalued vs SQ?” the answer is that the company is predicting 10% annual rev growth which is not anywhere near what other highly valued fintechs are putting up. The biggest overhang is that it’s a SPAC and Blackstone and CVC will almost certainly monetize some of their stakes through a secondary before year end. Before that happens and lockups expire institutional investors are going to stay wary thus any near term rally will likely sell off.

I think the optimism here comes from the continued hope for legalized online gambling.  Using a YOY revenue growth from 2019 to 2020 is not what most investors are paying for. 2020 saw lot of sports have shortened seasons and it really is just the beginning of online sports betting."

2021-05-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLOV volume price analysis   

Hi fellow traders, this is my first time posting on WSB and wanted to share with you some TA using volume price analysis on CLOV. I got interested in CLOV recently and having profited a lot on GME (bought in shares and options in November). I felt this was my next big bet.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2sx4id9ldlw61.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fabd25308652e8c12e834d7e4f17b77e160b430

First of all on the weekly chart, I see signs of the market maker buying during the bear market in this stock that lasted from January to March. At #1, we have a hammer candle with a deep lower wick on very high volume which signals that the market maker is trying to stop the downfall and failed. The stock pursued its fall and reached the buying climax by the market maker in March. I can see this with the high volume and deep lower wick. Having retraced a significant amount since its ATH, the market needed to test this level to see if all the sellers were out of the market. The $7 retest was successful on low volume as we can see with the small doji that printed on the chart in april. The retest was above the ATL signaling strength. The next 4 candles have higher highs, higher lows and very very high volume. The long upper wicks signal that insiders are trying to push the price down but are incapable of breaking the trend because the buying pressure is intense.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w4oo9rdmdlw61.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=11d7e1ed18232b575526ec194f840d47fddaa3f4

On the daily chart, we see the buying climax with the white hammer having a deep lower wick that coincided with the general market bottoming out in March. #2 was an attempt to breakout on high volume but was unsuccessful; the market retreated on falling volume, which is bullish. #3 is a very interesting candle: the stock tried to breakout again but was pushed violently to the downside below $9 on insane volume. Insiders were very desperate to push this stock down. #4 was the breakout on again very high volume. Insiders were trying to push the stock down again but failed! The following candles saw a test of the commitment of the sellers (test of supply) and there was none! Instead, we saw the stock trending lower of declining volume, which is very bullish (this is where I pulled the trigger and got a fill at $9.42 once the stock started climbing again). It didn’t take long for the stock to rise again on high volume, only to be suppressed once again. The battle isn’t over with the bears, but the signals that the bulls are starting to take over are there when you look at price and volume. At the second to last candle we see a bearish candle called the dark cloud cover: it signals a short term downtrend. As we see with the last candle (inverted hammer), the volume is declining once again as sellers are not in the market. This could signal the end of this short-term downtrend, but we need more price action to confirm this. There is a case for a short squeeze in this stock, though I don’t believe it will squeeze like GME since the percentage of the float shorted is nowhere near what GME was. Clearing the $14 mark on high volume is very important to see this stock soar to the ATH of $17.50 and beyond. The last candles on the chart signal a bumpy ride ahead; the bears will not give up easily but when they do, this bet will be a very rewarding one.

P.S.: Don’t take my word for it and do your own DD.

2021-05-01 23:52:09,wallstreetbets,"Glad to read some good TA. If you draw trend lines starting with upward move on 4/8 its clearly still within its channel despite volatility. Will be looking for support along the 10MA on Monday with a high volume move above Fridays high. Hopefully will see low volume tight consolidation around the $14 range with possible shake out below trend line, followed by a high volume bounce and move above the pivot. Other considerations: lots of overhead supply due to 65% draw down, 35% short float and WSB gang. Its behaving surprising well so far given all those factors, should be interesting."

2021-05-01 20:05:34,wallstreetbets,The options market is betting on a massive rise in price in the coming months. The volume in may calls is crazy high compared to puts. I just bought June contracts for added safety. Too many times I bought OTM contracts that expired worthless and then the stocks rallies as predicted. It’s frustrating to be right and still loose money. God speed for your calls!
2021-05-02 01:43:21,wallstreetbets,Why do you apes get CALLS that expire so soon? Doesnt theta start eating it up? Is this a short term play?
2021-05-02 01:25:52,wallstreetbets,O short shares? Shittt can you provide a source?
2021-05-01 22:58:23,wallstreetbets,Im in on puts at 7.50 after earnings. I think Im going to hit there then buy shares. There will be massive pressure to sell off and a lot of players will bite. Just my 2c
2021-05-01 23:56:39,wallstreetbets,"The call put ratio is pretty high. Big money is betting that it goes up earnings, but still see it as too risky to buy shares."

2021-05-02 09:59:36,wallstreetbets,"Lol look at nostradamus up here.  Congrats you sucessfully predicted what most meme stocks do.  Rocket one day pull back and hopefully rocket more.

I'm betting its not done going up.  Maybe I'm wrong hopefully I'm right but thats about as much of a prediction of you getting yours right on a day when the entire market was bleeding."
2021-05-02 02:33:06,wallstreetbets,"What’s your prediction for this stock next week then, and why? How did you foresee 9.80?"
2021-05-02 03:13:04,wallstreetbets,"Not everything is a success or failure based on a days + or -. 

Nice calling the price but there is no reason this can’t head north in the lead up to earnings in less than two weeks"
2021-05-02 10:29:16,wallstreetbets,"I’m very happy to see bears are still present in this stock. This means there is still a lot of upside potential  from bears being converted into bulls.

2021-05-01 23:52:29,wallstreetbets,What do you mean roll over your positions?  Cash out your may options and buy June options?
2021-05-01 23:49:07,wallstreetbets,you do realize most people pick their options based on the fact everyone else is piling into them so going by high volume only means they suckered a million other people into it. If you're piling into the option that has the vast majority of the volume you can rest assured you're about to get fucked over by the MM

2021-05-02 07:03:18,wallstreetbets,The price has to be above 30 for 90 consecutive days. So even above 30 you have time. Not likely the CEO/Founder sells anyway.

That being said, if their earnings are worse, I am dumping in a heartbeat and will look at it again in 6 months."

We're just people who know when you guys go full retard and pile all your money in thinking you're going to the moon, that we can just get a piece of the inevitable rugpull that takes it all back.

You fucking idiots don't get that the IB's are on to you and are buying into the stock WITH you and then using those bought shares to take it all back and grab your money later.  You retartedly believe that you're ""squeezing the shorts"", too stupid to understand you're just giving them more comfortable sorry short positions each time."
2021-05-01 22:05:47,wallstreetbets,"Ok got it. Maybe a novice question but For my info - But why would the MM try to push the price lower at this level , he thinks that the price is too high?"

They’ve failed to meet their growth estimates since they arrived in the industry as well as expansions. Its a mess of a company all around, would anyone even know the ticker/company if it werent for the famous SPAC lord Chamath who is all for the retail crowd but has been in hiding for the past 3-4 months as everything got clobbered? Dont get me wrong the stock can run given a short squeeze but the company is without a doubt terrible. We've seen this before so guess we'll see if it gains any serious traction"

2021-05-02 14:00:28,wallstreetbets,Yeah run up then may 17 earnings..dump.. expires worthless may 21 😭
2021-05-02 19:46:31,wallstreetbets,"I think it seems to have strong enough earnings in a segment that seems to still have a lot of legs left. There seems to be strong earnings in the sporting goods segment and it’s at a more modest valuation than Dick’s. 

So I think it has enough support at this level to be moderately bullish. I’ve done pretty well the past few months with a moderate bullish strategy of having long positions combined with covered calls and writing naked puts. 

So on up days, I :(1) sell calls against my long positions; or (2) close some long positions if it’s waaay up. 

On down days, I write puts. or if it’s way down, I close my covered calls at a profit or buy more stock long. 

You seem to know far more about technical analysis of volume and price changes, and I was wondering if there are similar signs of market makers testing support levels, or insiders pushing the stock price around on ASO. ASO seems to almost always have a very rapid spike or drop each day even if it doesn’t end up moving much overall. Seems unusual. (To me
It seems like there is more going on than some “efficient market” simply moving the stock in concert with more broad fundamentals.)

I know there is some WSB chatter on ASO too. So I don’t know how that factors into the stock price."
2021-05-02 00:05:04,wallstreetbets,"Yes, ideally before theta decay starts to bite too hard."

2021-05-01 23:36:28,wallstreetbets,"Don't consider yourself a bad holder until the price craters because of genuinely bad news. Something like the tech isn't actually ready or as good as they are claiming... The sharp rise and fall are just market shenanigans, the fundamentals are still there.

I've got no such ambition.  I've got a profit goal of 50% in mind and once its there im out.  If it doesnt go there by earnings i'm out.  I have no long term ambitions at this moment for clover in general too much about it is unknown.  But a short term gamble eh fuck it why not.  I got legit shit to fall back on that is financing this anyhow.  I'm a realist i'd be happy exiting at 12.  Got 10C 5/21 calls and 80 shares at 9.53.  Worse comes to worse i lose a good amount on the options hopefully not all of it and maybe take a hit on the shares.  But i don't think hitting 12 in the next week is unrealistic that's all i'm looking for i'd rather not roll the dice on earnings."

2021-05-02 11:40:46,wallstreetbets,When in the day do we scalp puts ? Is it RSI based?
2021-05-01 23:15:49,wallstreetbets,"The purpose of prolonging the accumulation phase is to be able to buy the stock cheaper before starting a campaign and moving it higher. Usually, big players cannot fill up in a few days since their buying power would influence the price too greatly. Also, Wyckoff’s law of cause and effect explains that building the cause is a very important part of any campaign to markup the price. As discretionary operators, we will never know. What we do know is that Wyckoff’s first law of supply and demand is signaling every test of supply has demonstrated seller’s are not in this market."
2021-05-01 22:23:16,wallstreetbets,So they can buy more? So their shorts/puts print more?
2021-05-02 10:24:57,wallstreetbets,You are right that past fundamentals are weak. Remember that markets are forward looking and trading solely on past news is a good way to always miss the home runs.

2021-05-02 18:43:02,wallstreetbets,"My guess is that the stock will peak a day or two after earning's report, then drop, then climb back up at the end of May, then drop again and will float around 12-14 dollar mark there after. If people want to buy in, now is the time and it's not too late. I'm a retard though, so who knows honestly."
2021-05-02 07:50:52,wallstreetbets,"After earnings. Will take a loss, but no point holding. If they can't improve premium to claim margins as covid improves, they have problems."

2021-05-02 00:46:00,wallstreetbets,"As someone who missed the recent rocket launch on MVIS and has been wanting to jump in for the past few days, any idea on how low it will go until it bounces up again? I agree the fundamentals are still there and is easily worth $20+ a share. I'm predicting (and hoping) it'll drop down to around $12-$13 a share so I can buy in, but not sure. Any ideas?"
2021-05-01 21:51:47,wallstreetbets,As of 4/16. The updated data will be interesting and I’d bet based on the action we’ve seen it will be higher on the next SI data report

The only reason you don't like him is because he's telling you you're wrong.

Saying, ""Nuh uh!!"", Is hardly a cogent debating strategy let alone a segway to talk about the fundamentals.

If you can't bother to ask civil and reasoned questions you have no right to expect anything more."
2021-05-02 19:27:09,wallstreetbets,"Yes I always go my own road, make my own strategy. I just like knowing how other people do it.

2021-05-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Everything looks upside let us wait and see Timeframes matter when it comes to analysis and possible outcomes. What do I mean by timeframes? I’ll use Gold to explain, but this applies to all markets with the caveat that each analyst, trader, or investor has their own definitions of what these timeframes are. It’s not an exact science, but this will explain the concept of timeframes.

Very Short-Term: The next move in Gold over the next 24-72 hours. The imminent outlook.

Short-Term: A forecast for up to the next several days, weeks, or even a few months.

Medium-Term: A few months up to a year.

Long-Term: Expectations for the next year and beyond.

For example, I have been a  bull  in precious metals and miners since I started buying them last year . My expectations for Gold long-term are for a ‘minimum’ price of $3,000in the next few years and far higher after that. I have similar expectations 80 usd  silver and  the miners, where I expect even greater percentage gains. Call me a Goldbug , whatever. It’s a badge of honour, in my opinion, but it’s safe to say that I’m extremely bullish long-term.
Does this mean I can’t be bearish short- or medium-term? Of course not. Nothing goes up in a straight line, and as we’ve seen since the bottom in march 2020 , we’ve had some huge reversals in Gold during that time.

When I was thinking n July 2020 that we would get a massive pullback beginning in August for multiple reasons, I was bearish medium-term (i.e., for the next few months from August onwards),  However, I’m clearly bullish long-term. So am I a bear or a bull? I’m clearly a Gold bull who was bearish in the medium term. This is called being objective, which my own  process enables me to be. I focus on the data and try to eliminate my  emotion from my analysis; emotion is the curse of many who trade and invest in this sector. Sentiment is one of the most powerful tools in precious metals, because so many are so passionate about Gold and Silver that they let their emotions get the better of them at or near peaks and troughs, typically a sign that the market is about to turn the other way.
Of course, the same can be said in the opposite direction.

When everyone is bearish and markets are extreme oversold, it’s time to look up. In this case, I’m bullish short-term, medium-term, and long-term. But even then, I’ll point out the “risks” in the very short-term because, as I said, nothing goes up in a straight line. Does this mean I’m bearish? Obviously not. I’m simply stating that there is a risk that Gold falls in the next few hours or days before heading higher again. Why do I say “risk”? Because no one knows for sure where these markets are headed, especially in the very short-term. A risk is not a forecast, it’s a warning. In this case, it means don’t get shaken out if we do get a short-term pullback. Such reversals are a gift, because they provide greater fuel for the next leg higher.
Lastly, I am not a day trader. I’m an   investor. 

investor waits patiently for major turns in the market and then takes positions either long or short that will be held for several weeks or months before the next major peak or troughs occur, such as those in August 2020, and a month ago. I consider such a trading strategy far more profitable with a higher degree of success than trying to play the micro moves on a daily basis, but to each their own. Whereas the investments I made in physical  Silver and lesser amount gold  .

The point being that I can be bearish short- and medium-term but bullish long-term. In my opinion, this means I’m a bull who can be objective. Timeframes matter when it comes to analysis, and the best analysts, traders, and investors can switch from bullish to bearish and back again based on the data. With that out of the way, what does the data say for metals  here?
Gold 
 Straight off the bat: I am expecting new record highs in Gold this year.
1800 is acting as resistance following a >$120 rally off the lows. Until that breaks and Gold closes above 1800, the “risk” of a lower low remains. 
SILVER

I am expecting new highs in Silver this year. 50 usd even more my imho .
All guns are blazing in Silver. Its MACD Line has turned positive. The RSI continues to rise off its extreme oversold low of 30. It has broken its downtrend since the peak on February 1. But it has now run into resistance at its prior high of 26.74 back on March . It’s clearly reasonable to expect a pullback from here to 26 or 25.60 before heading higher .

CONCLUSION
Timeframes matter. In the very short-term, I expect to see some daily pullbacks across the sector. But unless we see key support levels broken on the downside, this just provides one last opportunity to get long for new highs this year."
2021-05-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Correlation between Short Sale Interest and Aurora Cannabis ACB Stock Price🥦🔥🚀🌝 There is a short squeeze incoming for Aurora Cannabis ACB in the next two weeks. This stock is shit. This stock is so shit, it’s rated as one of MarketBeat’s worst stocks to invest in. This is why people are often shorting. Attached is a link to MarketWatch’s report of short sale/interest history since last November.

[Aurora Cannabis ACB Short Sale Data](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/ACB/short-interest/)

Date - $ACB Underlying - Total Shares Sold Short

11/30/20 - $11.68 - 36,540,000

12/15/20 - $10.21 - 36,540,000

12/31/20 - $8.31 - 36,540,000

01/15/21 - $12.04 - 33,220,000

01/29/21 - $11.15 - 25,890,000

02/12/21 - $12.48 - 19,200,000

02/26/21 - $10.52 - 20,230,000

03/15/21 - $11.14 - 26,690,000

03/31/21 - $9.31 - 27,840,000

04/15/21 - $7.79 - 36,420,000

Aurora Cannabis is extremely volatile in those data points from November and December. As short interest approaches 40,000,000, the underlying stock price jumps upward. When approaching 40,000,000, there is difficulty covering shorts. You will notice when Aurora Cannabis has a massive price spike, the short interest drops rapidly from the point near 40,000,000.

In periods of low volume, bulls are holding and 🌈 🐻 are in extreme anxiety with the upcoming earnings report release. Those high price points in November and December came on from shorts placed at lower price points, subsequently pushing the price into those $10+ scenarios when unable to cover.

On the trading day of Friday April 30th, the volume was extremely low at 3.42M shares traded. People are quietly asking around to borrow ACB shares at major interest rates for shorts which make it unprofitable (60-70% instead of the traditional 5-20%).

With 36,420,000 shorts and an earnings report coming on 05/13 after-hours, Aurora Cannabis ACB is going to rise from $8.85 to over $10 by Friday, May 7th. On Monday, May 10th, volatility city is coming. The price will instantly jump all over the fucking place.

I bought tons of ACB $12c 05/21. I plan to sell between 05/11-05/14. Unusual options activity highlighted ACB $9c 05/21 on Barcharts. After I sell the Calls, I will switch to out-of-the-money Puts set to expire in June with all my profits.

I know tons of you are common stock bag holders. Let’s get your money back with options. I don’t care if you get rich on calls or puts. They’re both going to work when the stock has a bi-polar episode in the month of May.

May the tendies be with you.

this is a POS company, over the years, their SP dropped lower than your 120 y/o grampa's wrinkle ball sack and did a reserve split to keep their balls on Nasdaq without getting chopped off. fucked shareholders hard with their incompetence. i dumped a total of 90K to average down during the last spike and got out with breakeven, thank fuck! 

I hope no one is going to buy into this POS, at least not in shares. take your money and gamble elsewhere. AMC, GME, whatever, at least you know you are investing in a good company with goods odds. fuck $ACB."

I'm half tempted to sell on Monday regardless and pay off some fancy bags I'm holding on some other not so great bets. Cheers for posting!
2021-05-01 23:29:14,wallstreetbets,"So from what I understand (smooth brain still learning about calls and puts) you buy the $12c for 05/21, which is essentially buying them at $12 a share, expecting them to be far greater than that? and you have to sell your calls by the 21st, or they expire and you are only out of money from the premium you paid for the calls?  


Why buy at $12c and not something closer to the current price, if you think it will go up? is it to cover potential loss/cheaper premium?"
2021-05-02 02:12:36,wallstreetbets,lol I love how your declare it will go to over $10 by Friday as fact.  If anything this stock is more likely to have a price decline in the run up to its earnings date as people bail out from fears of yet another disappointing ER

It would have to be a lot, because the short interest is only a fraction of what GMEs was.

2021-05-02 01:40:03,wallstreetbets,"The problem for VG is that SpaceX will be able to undercut their suborbital tourism prices with orbital prices when Starship comes along. If even half what Musk projects about that vehicle pans out then it will rip the guts out of the entire industry. If they start getting their prototypes back soon and can thus increase their flight rate, they might be able to put humans on it as soon as next year."

2021-05-02 08:27:29,wallstreetbets,I just dislike investing in company whose two primary competitors are run by Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. This is like trying to play a video game on the ultra high difficulty setting that only unlocks after you’ve already beaten it.

2021-05-02 17:40:58,wallstreetbets,"It's actually the other way around.  Virgin Orbit is the orbital launch company that got spun out from Virgin Galactic, and VO actually reached orbit for the first time on their most recent launch attempt (LauncherOne with a NASA payload).  LauncherOne is a small-payload launcher (400kg to low earth orbit) which is air-launched like a missile from under the wing of a Boeing 747.

They are two completely separate companies now.  SPCE has no stake in Virgin Orbit.

Hypersonic flight is crazy difficult.  As someone who understands the aerodynamics and propulsion behind hypersonic flight, I'm not confident SPCE will actually fly a manned hypersonic vehicle anytime soon (10+ years)."

2021-05-02 05:54:47,wallstreetbets,"It’s true that the mission of SpaceX is to reach Mars; but in the process of that they will make a launch system that will undercut all the competition. The media hostility to Musk and the fact SpaceX feels little need for active PR means that there isn’t a wide appreciation as to the extend Starship will just blow apart the industry. It will be the IBM PC, or the iPhone, or the Model T. It will just change everything.

SpaceX will be using it to go to Mars, but they will also be making it available to any users who will pay. A space tourism company that isn’t shackled to legacy hardware - like Axiom or Space Adventures - will be able to purchase Starship flights to offer vastly superior services as significantly lower prices than both VG and BO."
2021-05-02 13:23:33,wallstreetbets,"Not yet they'll be public in July. They're doing it through a SPAC so if that's your cup of tea you can find the ticker and stuff on their subreddit but I can't post the company here cause of rules.

2021-05-02 01:53:16,wallstreetbets,"SpaceX is a wonderful company which will never go public which makes me sad. Rocket Labs is the next best thing with solid revenue, lots of government contracts, a self-sustaining business model, and top shelf leadership who stand by the company not just in rocketry but in full space logistical enterprise.

2021-05-02 01:52:45,wallstreetbets,I'd have shit myself when they landed the rocket back on the barge. SpaceX has had plenty of explosions and they will have plenty more. I'm sure many people will die trying to get to Mars. And I'm sure there will be thousands lined up to take that risk.

VG made the same mistake as the Shuttle program in that people have to be on board every flight. This pits safety against the objective of rapidly iterating and then ramping up launch rate. Whichever direction you go in then, you lose. SpaceX, Blue Origin and Rocketlab can all fire off as many rockets as they need to get their systems working efficiently without worrying about killing someone."

Not like death, but long enough for him to have a mental breakdown and with that breakdown comes a full epiphany on human compassion. When he returns a year later he realizes he needs to stop destroying small business and actually treat his employees like civilized humans."
2021-05-02 10:21:41,wallstreetbets,"You hit on the important part - regulatory authorities.  Most of your destinations are wholly government owned for the next 20-30 years.  They will not allow tourism at a moon station any time soon.  Long term, sure- but you're not jumping in a SPACEX flight to New London Mars anytime soon.  VG is positioned for an arguably niche market that will exist for 20-30 years and burn out afterward when space travel is as common as intercontinental travel by plane was back in the 1920s.  


PS - suborbital will also provide a window to faster terrestrial travel, e.g. NY to London in 1.5 hours if development goes that way.  Fits with Virgins other tourism assets."

2021-05-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Defending QuantumScape **Opportunity:** There's a case to be made about $QS. A company whose actually trying to do some good by creating an EV battery that is smaller, more efficient and creates less waste than current available technology. The EV battery market is expected to reach 67 billion dollars by 2025. QS is a high risk high reward proposition that has recently suffered a short attack from a hedge fund with a bad reputation for releasing over exaggerated claims to tank stocks.

[https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/electric-vehicle-battery-market-100188347.html](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/electric-vehicle-battery-market-100188347.html)

**Short Attack:** The short attack was accompanied by a long report with ""battery experts"" and former employees. Most of these claims surrounded issues with the battery technology itself. In reading the report, I don't see anything beyond typical problems that a company creating new technology would face (nothing that the average investor wouldn't already know). The report goes on and on slamming the CEO and the company for various actions and statements. On a personal note, reading through it made me sick. How is it that this is not market manipulation? The report spreads fear and tanks the stock right as they take a huge short interest.

[https://wccftech.com/a-short-seller-claims-that-quantumscape-qs-shared-only-nice-powerpoint-slides-with-volkswagen-vw-even-though-the-solid-state-battery-cells-were-tested-in-volkswagens-own/](https://wccftech.com/a-short-seller-claims-that-quantumscape-qs-shared-only-nice-powerpoint-slides-with-volkswagen-vw-even-though-the-solid-state-battery-cells-were-tested-in-volkswagens-own/)

**QS Reply:** The CEO has replied by stating they strongly believe in their technology, although they can't release any specifics (proprietary technology) they stand behind their work. Honestly, I don't think they have anything to prove at the moment. The company indeed won't generate revenue for another couple of years but they have never claimed to be able to. They have an investor in Bill gates and VW - who has tested the batteries in their own lab and chose to continue their investment.

**From VW:** “We are pleased to report that the QuantumScape cells met the technical milestones in our labs in Germany that we had previously agreed upon,” said Frank Blome, head of the Volkswagen Group’s Center of Excellence Battery Cell. “Achievement of this milestone is an important step for QuantumScape, and we look forward to receiving and testing subsequent generations of cells to get solid-state technology into series production.”

**Potential Catalyst:**

1. Biden proposes a 174 billion dollar investment into the EV space as part of his 2.25 trillion dollar infrastructure plan. The money will go to incentives for individuals to move into the EV space along with investing in future technology.

[https://www.greenbiz.com/article/key-things-know-about-bidens-ev-infrastructure-plan](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/key-things-know-about-bidens-ev-infrastructure-plan)

2) The company reports earnings 5/11 - (last earnings report saw a spike in stock price over 30%)

**TL:DR:** I see a company with huge upside, market expectation 67 billion by 2025, Bill gates is smarter than me, hedge funds are greedy, go to the moon while making a difference in the planet.

***Revenue Model***

***…***

Their membership acquisition is highly seasonal, with January being the highest enrollment month as a result of Medicare’s annual election period at the end of the year. Their members generally enroll for a full calendar year, creating a highly predictable revenue stream for that year and meaningful opportunities for them to re-enroll members for years to come.

***Member Enrollment***

Their revenue growth rate and long-term profitability are affected by their ability to increase their number of members, which requires that they both continue to enroll new members in their MA plans and retain existing members. Their membership expanded from **42,592** as of December 31, 2019, to **58,056** as of December 31, 2020\*\*, an increase of 15,464 members\*\*, primarily under Medicare’s annual election period process.

***Market Coverage***

They are focused on driving membership growth through geographic and market share expansion and are allocating resources and taking strategic actions to increase Their share in existing markets and enter into new markets. As a result, their revenue, growth rate and long-term profitability are also affected by their ability to achieve both objectives. **As of December 31, 2020**, they **offered plans in 34 MA markets across seven states** with **8% market** **share** of the individual, non-special needs plans (“non-SNP”) MA enrollees in these markets. **They have launched in 74 additional MA markets, expanding their footprint by an additional state, in 2021.**

**Total MA Market Growth 2021 YTD vs 2020:** **From 34 to 108 MA markets - 217% YOY Growth**

**MACHINE LEARNING IS THE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY**

They are singularly focused on creating great, sustainable healthcare to improve every life. They have centered Their strategy on building and deploying technology that they believe **will enable them to solve a significant data problem while avoiding the limitations of legacy approaches**. Currently, as a next-generation Medicare Advantage insurer, they leverage their flagship software platform, the Clover Assistant, to provide America’s seniors with PPO and HMO plans that are the obvious choice for Medicare-eligible consumers.

They call Their plans “Obvious” because they believe they are highly affordable—offering most of Their members the lowest average out-of-pocket costs for primary care physician co-pays, specialist co-pays, drug deductibles and drug costs in their markets—and provide wide network access and the same cost-sharing (co-pays and deductibles) for physicians who are in- and out-of-network. **By empowering physicians with data-driven, personalized insights at the point of care through their software platform, they believe they can improve clinical decision-making and viably offer these “Obvious” plans at scale, through an asset-light approach. They reach a broad array of consumers, including traditionally underserved populations.**

They drive adoption and use of the Clover Assistant across their network of primary care physicians (“PCPs”) by focusing on continuously improving its user-centric design, highly actionable and real-time clinical content, enhanced and rapid payment for Clover Assistant visits and simple onboarding.

As of December 31, 2020, over 2,400 PCPs had contracted to use the Clover Assistant to manage Their members’ care. High PCP engagement with the Clover Assistant enables real-time, data-driven decision-making for Their members at the point of care and drives rapid software iteration\*\*: the more that physicians use the Clover Assistant, the more it learns\*\* and furthers the precision of personalized data-driven recommendations. **They combine their payor data with physician-generated data and use this powerful closed feedback loop to continuously tune their clinical rules and machine learning models**, as well as to select and prioritize future software capabilities.

**The use and continuous improvement of the Clover Assistant has resulted in not only improved clinical decision-making but also strong plan performance.** The platform also facilitates identifying and engaging with their most at-risk members for their clinical programs designed to provide additional targeted care support, which is designed to further drive better plan performance. Taken together, they believe these enhancements will allow them to return a material portion of their savings to members through their “Obvious” plans and to continuously lower their members’ out-of-pocket costs and provide them with market-leading benefits.

My Position:  Long

I like the fundamental play.  The 39M shares short + 330,000 May21 Calls open with the Monday, May 17th Earnings Date for the company are just icing on the cake for potential upside.

&#x200B;

**ADDITIONAL NOTE:  Clover has moved up their release of earnings to Monday morning at 8:30am EST on May 17th.  330,000+ call options are open with a May 21st expiration.  Rarely do companies release negative earnings on a Monday morning.**

2021-05-01 22:54:39,wallstreetbets,"Why do you guys insist on pouring your hard work and time into non-established, non-profitable and uncertain stocks rather than companies whose business models consistently generate profit and have already proven themselves to be a successful operation with room for growth?

CLOV, MVIS and RKT always start as meme stocks that shoot up in price because of social momentum, short interest, etc., and then every time the stock goes back down people start talking about how good of a company they are, how much potential and growth they have, how undiscovered and revolutionary their technology is etc. and trick themselves that their initial investment was actually in good faith rather than a gamble. 

Be honest. Not one person on this subreddit in the past 2 weeks invested in CLOV because they ""have revolutionary AI technology"". They bought the shares and options because they literally just want to gamble on a momentum play and now you're all sitting here trying to make each other feel better by writing up disingenuous ""DD"" like this. Why don't you guys put your efforts towards researching more promising stocks? Why must it always be a giant go-big or go-home Hail Mary?

2021-05-02 09:03:07,wallstreetbets,"I understand the case being made that CLOV has upside potential, but I am concerned over some of the Risk Factors,

1. They mentioned that most of the revenue comes from 2 major metropolitan areas that are known for government intervention (New Jersey). This is concerning because any bad policy change can drastically affect them
2. CLOV states that they plan on incurring more expenses, and loses to continue. I am concerned this is indicative of future stock price falling.

I have not entered a position on CLOV, but I would like to understand more based on the feedback in this channel. I know CLOV has been promoted as a ""MEME"" stock, but the medicare technology seems promising."

The short squeeze potential from 40% of the free float being short is just a bonus, I wouldn’t have gone in hard if I didn’t think it was a legitimate long term healthcare play. If it squeezes then that’s a nice bonus, if it doesn’t then it’s a great long term hold. That’s why you see so many whale sized positions in CLOV, the downside risk is minimal."

2021-05-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Just what is going on with Vaxart? Up to date with VXRT and why I am betting this stock will potentially climb to higher highs (at least 2x). Edit 4: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vaxart-reports-first-quarter-2021-120000965.html

""Vaxart ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale debt securities of $177.3 million, compared to $126.9 million as of December 31, 2020.""

""Vaxart reported a net loss of $16.0 million for the first quarter of 2021""

""Research and development expenses were $10.1 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $1.5 million for the first quarter of 2020. The increase was mainly due to manufacturing and clinical trial expenses related to the COVID-19 and norovirus vaccine candidates."" (more money for their R and D is good news).

- Honestly, their financials don't look that bad to me. Their net loss is -16 million. However, they sold their atm offerings which led them to have healthy cash (over 177 million). Of course their taking some losses right now, it's called an investment for their oral pill and lab studies/permits. 

Let's look at where they're at in terms of vaccine development.

Source: https://investors.vaxart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-data-vaxart-oral-covid-19-vaccine-phase-i-study-suggests

1. Oral Covid Vaccine
-""Our vaccine’s immune response appears very different that that seen from the leading injectables(i.e. Pfizer, MRNA): mucosal antibodies rather than serum antibodies, and more potent T-cell responses... For our first oral COVID-19 vaccine candidate, we believe that these differences in immunogenicity profile may have a benefit in cross-reactive protection.”

-""Phase I study data was compared to T-cell responses from volunteers subsequently vaccinated with the Moderna or Pfizer mRNA vaccine, indicating the mRNA vaccines induced fewer T-cell responses."" (T-Cells are the ones that either stimulate B Cells to produce antibodies or help fight infected cells).

-""“CD8+ T-cells produced by our vaccine can recognize and are capable of destroying cells infected with the virus, including in the mucosa"".

-*** ""Vaxart’s vaccine candidate triggered specific IgA antibodies in the mucosa. These mucosal IgA responses appeared to be cross-reactive against other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1, MERS, and the endemic common cold viruses 229E, NL63, HKU1, and OC43"". (The T-cells were able to stimulate the B Cells to produce the mucosal antibodies...)


Prediction: Founder and CSO of Vaxart is presenting tommorow to the World Vaccine of Congress at 5 PM EST. Perhaps we will Dr. Sean Tucker talk more in-depth of their phase 1 clinical trial. 

Bear: What I don't like is that Phase II is delayed till the third quarter/mid-year. I'll update how bearish this is. Because short-term is everything at the stock market.



Edit 3: stock tanked today. Out of nowhere, vaxart released their financials this morning even tho their earnings were not till 5/11. Obviously they incurred a lot of costs due to their research. But also they are delaying their trial phase 2 due to manufacturing issues in their Baltimore plant. All this research.. at what cost…

Edit 2: 2 key dates. This Monday and Tuesday. 
Monday at 12 PM EST - will present updated antibody results (could still be 0 antibodies found) ! from their phase 1 trial (if 0 then stock will crumble else stock will rocket). and position how important T-cells are in vaccines (this is their strength in numbers). 

Tuesday at 5 PM EST - Chief Scientific Officer of Vaxart, Dr. Sean Thomas will present to the world vaccine of congress day 1(!) bullish about it being on day 1,  about holding the needles. They got a pill. 

I do not expect there to be any drastic rug pull on Monday due to their upcoming presentation on Tuesday. 

Edit 1: This post gained some traction. I just want to say this is a straight-up gamble. A: A classic pump and dump by the ceo to raise funds for their research/lab. Or B: They actually have updated results from their phase 1 trial that is promising. Stock is up 100% since last week. The two events/catalysts I listed are priced in. 

However, will we see another >= 50% run-up this week? What factors can contribute to another >50% run-up? 

Answer: We see a disgusting report/results from their phase 1 trial and how their oral covid pill matched up with other competitors in their T-Cell response. Their antibodies results, they're not really showing off. So I would be wary on their antibodies numbers. It is also antibodies from mucosal, which I think is different than the immune system. But from here we see:

 source: [https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1213](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1213) \- mucusal immunity paper 

The mucosal immune system three main functions are to 1) protect the mucous membranes against airbone microbes. 2) to prevent uptake of antigens from aribone matter and 3) prevent development of harmful immune response to these antigens if they reach to the body interior (i.e. past the mucuous system and into the cardiac system, lungs, stomach, digestive/ immune system)."

2021-05-02 03:25:41,wallstreetbets,"Couple of things to add I didn't see in your DD (Or i missed reading)

2021-05-02 01:23:40,wallstreetbets,"The global pandemic - once in a lifetime opportunity for Vaxart’s tech for the following reasons: 
1) benefits of temperature stable tablets for global distribution - we never had this magnitude of a virus problem in our lifetime. If we dont vaccinate a significant part of the world population, covid will continue to mutate and evade vaccine immunity - much like how bacteria mutate to evade antibiotics but viruses mutate even faster. So a pill is needed to distribute faster and literally vaccinate everyone within a short time frame is required to get ahead of the covid variants - otherwise we will only chase.

2) compressed vaccine development timeline due to the urgency in global need. Politicians and regulators have never backed vaccine development this fast. 

3) Public awareness and recognition of need of a vaccine platform for future response to pandemic threats. 

4) Environmental awareness and Green approach - waste from syringes, needles, gloves, etc will mount and cause environmental problems which are not being talked about by main media as it can appear as “anti vax”. 

5) Literally coronavirus vaccine market was created out of nothing from this pandemic and likely a recurring market/sales. 

Vaxart’s technology, if successful, will change the vaccine landscape and break our traditional association of needle with vaccines since the smallpox era.

Also once vaxart’s tech is proven to work through covid opportunity, it has a pipeline applications from norovirus to flu to any other mucosal/respiratory viruses. It can also be used to treat virus-related cancers such as HPV. 20billion is a conservative mid-term (1-2yrs) valuation; depending on execution this company could become a big pharma in the next 5-10 years."

1) stakeholders: until June 2020, Armstice, a hedge fund, controlled the company owning the majority of shares, and took 2 board seats. It was basically ran like a startup and likely was geared towards the hedge fund’s exit strategy. That is no longer an issue, that hedge fund exited their position and gave up 2 board seats which we filled one recently. 

2) CEO changed last year, and executive additions. Not to mention all the scientist hires. etc. More manpower, fresh energy, and company executions and operations have been very responsive so far. 

3) funding: prior to 2020, the company was just like the many penny biotechs out there where they dilute shareholders significantly to raise cash just to last the next year, etc. Barely getting by. 
However since the price run up from pennies to now dollars, the cash raise barely dilute shareholders. They are sitting on about 180mil as of end of Q1 this year. The company can focus on science and growth now, and not worry about stock sales at massive discounts just to survive."

2021-05-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Cohu; the plug for your favorite semiconductor companies What if I told you that Qualcomm, Intel, Skyworks, Texas Instruments, Samsung, and Analog devices all had something in common in their supply chain? They all buy their testing capital equipment from Cohu. 

Cohu offers a few different products. All of them are within the market of testing computer chips. Why is this market important? Well on the customer end, imagine if you spent 2500$ on a laptop and the intel chip inside didn't work. You'd return it to BestBuy, who would return it to HP, who would return it to Intel. A long and expensive chain of returns for a nonfunctional product. This issue can also be more than just an inconvenience. What if you bought a self driving tesla and one of the chips in the sensors didn't work? What if a Boeing airbus had some faulty chips in the navigation system? In short, it's very important that the semi manufacturers know that their product is working when they send it out. 

**Bullish trends**

1. Semiconductor volume is increasing in the following industries, **mobile phones** (5g needs 2x the chips), **Computing**, **Automotive** (electric and self driving need exponentially more chips than cars of the past), **Cloud computing** (basically a warehouse of semiconductors) **AI** (not sure how this works, but it's going to need computer chips). Here's my main argument: ***Each of those markets is rapidly growing, and at the same time chip volume is rising in each of those markets***. This creates a sort of exponential effect for the semiconductor chain. Not only is there a strong catalyst from increasing volume in existing markets (phones, pcs), but we also see rapidly growing new markets that also have high density. (cloud, auto). This is very bullish for the entire semi supply chain.  But the key feature that benefits testing in particular, is increasing complexity of chips. A more complex chip requires more complex testing, which demands a higher premium. 
2. Semiconductor shortage. We all know demand for computer chips is very high. And supply has just about run out. This means that prices for semiconductors should increase due to scarcity. This is great news for Cohu, as it leaves more margin to charge for testing. If you were ford would you pay a premium on chips in order to produce your vehicles?
3. Increasing chip complexity, on smaller wafers, demands a higher price for testing. AMAT recently noted on April 6th analyst day that capital intensity (% revenue spent on capital equipment) is returning to the 2000 highs of 16%. This increased capital intensity seems especially true when we consider the global chip shortage. Intel and Tsm are opening new fabs in the last couple months. These factories are going to require a shit-ton of capital equipment. For example TSMC announced they'll be spending $100 billion over the next 3 years on capital equipment, as their fabs have been running at 100% for months and still can't keep up with demand.
4. Trend of strong growth. Cohu has shown strong growth in the last year. In Q1 2020, revenue was $138.9 million, and gross margin was 41.7%. Q1 2021 revenue was just reported at $225.1 million, and gross margin was 45.6%. This is annual revenue growth of 62%, and margin growth of 9%. Business outlook in only getting better as the semiconductor shortage worsens, and demand continues to grow across sectors.
5. Very high accounts receivable. Accounts receivable is up 30% annually to 197 million$. Recurring customers represent 48% of Cohu's revenue, so this is a very strong sign in my opinion. 

**Bearish trends**

1. The company is on a huge downturn in the last few trading days due to announcing 42-45% gross margin for Q2 instead of 45%+, like Q1. This is on increased revenue of 234-250 million forecasted for Q2. A decrease in GM on growing revenue is never a great sign. The reason for this change is that much of the forecasted growth is in the automotive segment, which is lower margin than other segments I mentioned in the last section. Essentially the chips in cars aren't as complicated as the chips in PCs or phones, so they are less expensive, and therefore have a lower margin for testing. I will point out that the firm is likely to generate more gross margin dollars next quarter than this quarter, albeit on lower gm %. (.43x240=$103.2 gm, vs this last quarter 225x.456=$102.6gm). 
2. Recent stock offering. Cohu sold 4,950,000 shares at 41$ at the start of march. This diluted the shares available, but raised $202 million for the firm. They used this to pay off debt, and fund future growth. 
3. strong competition. Cohu's main competitors are advantest, and teradyne. These are two large global firms that have significantly more financial resources than Cohu. Cohu does have some advantages over these strong competitors, it's the global leader in Radio frequency power amplifier. RF amplifiers are a key component in mobile phones, and are increasing in volume with the 5g rollout. (more chips per phone, and more complexity) Essentially Cohu is in the dominant position in this growing market. Cohu is also the leader in automotive handling. (handling is a process where chips are moved into the testing device, then sorted based on results).

**Fundamental analysis**

I use a ratio similar to p/e. I use gross margin/market cap. (If I was buying the whole company, I'd want to know how much profit I'm purchasing).

Cohu annual gm=$316,000,000. Cohu market cap=$1,925,000,000

$316 million/$1925 million=6.09

This is a very attractive price/gm ratio. Lets compare it to some other companies ratios. 

Cohu-6.09

aapl-19.12

amzn-18

ter-11.3

advantest-7.19

swks-17.9

If cohu were trading at the same multiplier as it's large cap competitor, Teradyne, the stock price would nearly double.

Taking a look at the balance sheet, Cohu is in a much better position today than 1 year ago. They have $290 million of cash, almost double from a year ago. They also have significantly lower long term debt. \~$200 million today versus \~$300 million a year ago. 

&#x200B;

**Technical analysis**

[Cohu 1 year chart](https://preview.redd.it/pav84wurgjw61.png?width=1504&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d65ce5a266334b6f1c8a9cd3fb344509441451e)

As we can see from the 1 year chart above, Cohu seems to find support around the $40 mark for the past 6 months. Currently it's chillin out on the support line, so this indicates to me that it's a good time to purchase cohu, as I love buying dips. We can also see it's found resistance at around $50, having tested that line 3-4 times since the start of the year. I cannot say with certainty that it will break this resistance line, but I do expect it to at least check this number again some time in the next 2-3 months. My expected range for this stock in the next 3 months is between $50 and $65, which leaves room for some nice profit if one were to buy at $40. 

In conclusion, cohu is a small cap in an extremely hot market. It's got some big competitors, but it holds certain key advantages over them. The financial position of the company is really good currently, and it's growth should continue for the foreseeable future. It's strongest catalyst is that semiconductor density is increasing in existing markets, and new markets are emerging with high density, which has the potential to create enormous growth. For this reason, I think COHU is a great choice. (Even if you disagree on Cohu, you will want to have some semiconductors in your portfolio for the next few years).

**$130 calls on September 17 🚀 🚀 🚀**

**Expectation: Acquisition by Google.**

I discuss how to think about Fastly as an investment to folks who have reasoned that investing in cloud compute and networking is a good idea but may not necessarily understand how or why it’s a good idea. We focus on basic networking and the consequences of “serverless” computing; an architecture that has gained popularity in recent years.

I’ve written about Cloudflare before in May 2020, on an account called u/codingprofessor, before taking DD writing more seriously. I claimed that Cloudflare would blow past $60 dollars and was critically undervalued due to COVID economics, their current position in web security, and serverless computing. I still view that Cloudflare and Fastly can both reach 40B+ marketcaps by 2023.

# Purpose

To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts can outpace Wall Street analysts at places like Morningstar or The Motley Fool. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that often gets filtered out.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation or cooperation. Here are some recent DDs:

# Cloudflare vs. Fastly

**- TL;DR Fastly makes stuff faster, Cloudflare is more general purpose. They can be used together.**

[Support](https://preview.redd.it/8nw4s6mlojw61.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&s=0060e02dd4363ce7e7cc4cf3b59b3438603b9bc7)

This is a common question that is asked by investors interested in the cloud computing space from both novices and experts alike. In my view, the comparison isn’t very useful and usually illustrates some misunderstanding between the two product spaces. Fastly is focused on real-time services and acts as an optimizing layer for existing network providers. Cloudflare is a general network competitor. You can use both, and most do.

&#x200B;

[General purpose needs](https://preview.redd.it/8g9lk7uhwjw61.png?width=2314&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdaadd144aa9a0b64a37a3c05a6f236c965fefb6)

In a crude sense, Fastly focuses on convenience akin to the services provided by Costco, while players like Akamai or Cloudflare focus on the convenience brought to you by gas stations or companies like Walmart. It’s not to say that one is better than the other, because it's not. They just solve different problems with completely different approaches. You may not go to Costco as often as you do Walmart, but when you go to Costco, you're picking up and utilizing a lot more.

This explains why Fastly takes the approach to generally co-operate with other service providers and is able to provide a range of services for things like Snapchat storage, Spotify network meshes, Google Cloud services, and other real-time demands from the tech industry.

&#x200B;

>""While a convenience store is generally closer to a person's home, it has a limited set of items for sale. If the person drives a few more miles to the supermarket, they could get all of their groceries in one trip. In this case, convenience stores represent the approach taken by the legacy CDN's with many local POPs and the supermarkets represent Fastly's approach with fewer, larger ones.""

&#x200B;

Cloudflare has ambitions to compete with the likes of companies like Amazon and attempts to be a general purpose solution for networking on the internet - it wants to make the internet more accessible, safer, and fair. Fastly seeks to solve specific problems on the internet. So in a nutshell, one is a general solution and the other is a specialized solution.

An example of specialized needs provided by Fastly is like Reddit’s execution of the r/place experiment in 2017 - which allowed millions of users to collaborate and draw an image together pixel by pixel with rules and regulations in real-time.

[Real-time collaboration services meets art and communtiy.](https://i.redd.it/2kf4qnoorjw61.gif)

This is only one example of many. The way I like to frame it is by viewing real-time and collaborative services as a relatively new economic need, and thus a product like Fastly has a high demand from organizations that excel with these kinds of services. You may see associations with Fastly from places like Spotify, Ticketmaster, or The New York Times - all of which have specific needs or demands when it comes to content delivery and network management.

[world-class research](https://preview.redd.it/m9muspwsrjw61.png?width=1594&format=png&auto=webp&s=72b18b1b49ed8aed906a2b9936beb1e29a5479a1)

A big advantage that Fastly has in this regard is the fact that they often build their network with the intention of being world-class from top to bottom, from the code they write to the metals that build their points of presence. They are effectively able to choose their destiny as a product versus having to race the horses in competition. They research, experiment, and execute on the boundary of networking, making it a superb way to play the serverless and networking industry from a long point of view.

The result of this approach means higher quality servers and less need to rely on the number of PoPs used.  This ultimately means that Fastly spends less on building and maintaining servers while being an order of magnitude faster at the same time. They are efficient and provide value per the dollar spent on their network from customers and internal alike.

&#x200B;

[the capex equation](https://preview.redd.it/s9n1xm5zrjw61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=65e97432b694a884e1445db1793377e0f3eefa8c)

Cloudflare's team of course counters this by saying that speed is not nearly as important as Cloudflare's ability to be compliant to global requirements. This is completely nonsense if you consider that in the long-term, Fastly's general approach is to solve specific problems rather than to function as a general purpose network.

The compliance debate is a bogus marketing attempt when Fastly's speeds, in the microseconds, is exponentially faster than Cloudflare's serverless implementation that sits in the milliseconds range. This is frankly an example of how Matt Prince is warmer to investors and plays a stronger marketing game than Artur Bergman, who seemingly could not care to impress Wall Street funds and plays for the long-term.

[Matt Prince's Hierarchy of Developer's Needs](https://preview.redd.it/9afefjyasjw61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=af129b27bf734c74c0d8a039341ff03b126af5c1)

Why does this distinction matter? Well what of the requirements where networking speed and response times are critical, like hospital communications, stock market crashes, wildfires, or other problems unique to the challenges of running a network?

>The way to think about this is, what do you pay for, right? I mean if you -- and where are these moments that are valuable. When Tiger Wood walks down with the 18th green the Masters and God willing he is able to do that again, that matters, that moment matters. Everyone is going to tweet about it, and everyone wants to see it, the company that is in charge of that cares desperately about that content. When you send a gift across the Internet, like it's not monetized in the same way, it's not as valued.. So where we have seen the value is in content that is highly valuable to customers and their end consumer, where they're willing to pay for it and the quality, and the security and the scale of that deeply matters. And we have always focused our work on that type of content. There's plenty of content that just scrapes by and is low commodity. Every month, they want a lower price. That's a different market from our perspective, and we're not in it."" - Fastly CEO

# Understanding Content Delivery

**- TL;DR You have data, you cut the data into smaller pieces, send it across a network, and rebuild those pieces somewhere else.**

[The global cache](https://preview.redd.it/a92mp9wesjw61.png?width=951&format=png&auto=webp&s=c98e66b61a7b13f89a4556399c8264a038bb16ac)

It’s helpful to understand the 7  steps that protocols take as they travel across and through a network around the world. This model is known as the OSI model and it’s not necessarily the end-all-be-all model that governs the internet; but it is a useful framework to understand at a glance.

There are many complexities that go behind these protocols and they are the subject of intense debate or research. At the same time, many of these steps follow a similar process - translate or transform the data that’s received and sent.

&#x200B;

[Edge computing, an extension of the cloud.](https://preview.redd.it/r5k1yknbyjw61.png?width=472&format=png&auto=webp&s=60bbe4420f4025c8c791d62c569453ce82a8a8b0)

For example, the web browser translates the data into machine bytecode in a similar way that a networking router will need to translate information into a stream of 0 and 1 signals. This may not make too much sense yet, but just remember that it’s just a series of translations and preparations of data into different segments so that it could be read and understood by other pieces of hardware.

3. **Session Layer:** A communication session is initiated. A network communication is initiated, with various receivers at some set of defined internet address routes.
4. **Transportation Layer:** The data is further segmented and prepared for transportation.
5. **Network Layer:** Once the data has reached this stage, the segments are converted to packets.
6. **Data Link Layer:** The data is sliced into frames and delivered to the physical layer.
7. **Physical Layer:** The frames are converted into a bitstream of 0s and 1s as a way to represent that final stage of data representation, which are signals that along a physical medium like a cable.

&#x200B;

As the data reaches its destination, it goes through the 7 layer process again in the opposite direction, where the data is received at the physical layer and concludes at the application layer (the person who you sent an Zoom call to). There’s a reason that the network use trucks or mail deliveries as ways to compare the process as it can be strikingly similar at times.

What are the complexities related to delivering a letter, a box of clothes, or a Home Depot truck full of metals and wood? So that’s the essence behind content-delivery networks - preparing information and delivering it with optimal paths.

It’s worth taking some time to ponder and think about this. They may be words or ideas that you’ve heard - routers, bitstreams, addresses, and so on. What is the difference between collecting a Pinterest pin, playing a Spotify stream, or setting up a Zoom call without a video? How do we utilize location data when it comes to COVID containment efforts? What are the consequences of correcting a news article, fact checking a social media post, or reconciling the differences in video game connections in a game like Call of Duty?

With this developing model in mind, consider again how Cloudflare is particularly invested in the overall health of a network, while Fastly is primarily concerned with pushing the network further. They seek to solve different platforms, while having obvious overlaps at the same time.

# Serverless Compute - The Event Driven Network

**TL;DR Serverless allows software engineers to spend more time building products.**

[The event driven network](https://preview.redd.it/lhez9rq6tjw61.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb377d7a5f2c3d3995c4c56ec0a5b925a860e0f7)

What serverless architecture accomplishes is that it adds programmability and portability to the cloud clusters and the network. There are two major benefits to serverless computing:

1. It grants developers access to complex functions out of the box.

For example, if a developer wants to create a lightning fast application where taking an image of a crop plant returns some analysis about the health of the crop or warning signs that the crop image is showing, a serverless ""function-as-a-service"" can provide that capacity for a developer.

https://preview.redd.it/bm6jwodptjw61.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=29a9e9552a1f3874b8932e5baaabe5bf91c8fccd

That image is stored with the provider to improve the quality of future recommendations and output as well. Given that the image taker is likely situated in a rural area, edge computing like this allows the application to complete this process much faster than communicating to a central server that is in a much farther location.

&#x200B;

[Functions as a service](https://preview.redd.it/1trzui6ctjw61.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=5501fee8d2a9a8e2e5bce681a6b86d6f48e69da3)

2. It allows developers to spend more time working on application code rather than infrastructure tosupport it.

Imagine that a product that benefits off real-time services and events has particular problems handling the amount of traffic that reaches their servers. A perfect example of this are the server failures of Rob-in-the-hood during spikes of activity or Reddit's own ability to handle surges of logins, registrations, and activity after events like GME's stock market explosion. Other historical problems were things like World of Warcraft's expansion releases, where servers were effectively ""on fire"" and required round-the-clock support.

Edge computing effectively offloads some of these problems from central servers by making the network more programmable and effective. If an application I wrote suddenly has to manage 1,000,000 users, a serverless architecture allows for intelligent ""autoscaling"" - which means that services like Fastly will handle those problems for me. This ultimately results in a metered pay-as-you-go system.

&#x200B;

[The network as a utility](https://preview.redd.it/hq7l51wwtjw61.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1f88e8d28b452a5bf0a7d0c560e22e8b2ba0f7a)

The combination of these two benefits is pretty powerful, allowing a developer to essentially start up an idea from application to deployment at a much faster pace. I believe this should equip a reader with the ability to imagine the opportunity behind edge and serverless computing. Here are some simple questions I like to think about:

&#x200B;

[we've all been there.](https://preview.redd.it/ydk0hfx7ujw61.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c506b4d99dfd7e7f512f9d304f5c1e8f53e52e9)

\- Can we improve the customer experience of swiping a card in a store or other network based currencies?

\- How do we improve the security of individual network-connected devices?

\- Are we able to improve the response times of emergency technologies like hospital or firefight dispatching?

\- Are we able to better measure online engagement and create new interactive experiences?

\- Will online video games require servers bounded by location?

\- Would we be able to change camera angles when watching a sports stream?

\- Can we improve the quality of industrial automation or logistics?

\- Are we able to extend programmability to ""node"" based products like windmill farms or electric vehicle charging stations?

&#x200B;

[ 🚀](https://preview.redd.it/5otn5vekvjw61.png?width=2230&format=png&auto=webp&s=14201da0292e3f895dc829239999889d0af43add)

Some of these questions are asked by Fastly themselves, as they list the following subjects of interest in their S-1:

1. **API acceleration**. Accelerate and secure critical API responses at the edge for delightful application experiences, such as instant hotel lookup based on location and real-time inventory updates between retail stores and their online storefronts;
2. **IoT**. Process and secure data from connected devices at the edge for instant results for time-sensitive applications;
3. **Cloud migration**. Seamlessly migrate from data center to cloud, hybrid or multi-cloud environments, enabling the customer to take advantage of the functionality and cost savings of one or more cloud providers
4. **Enabling redactedchain (block)**. Cache and accelerate individual transactions on the redactedchain (block) in real time.

# Conclusion

TL;DR Investing in some form of serverless computing is a good idea.

You may have noticed that I did not discuss financials. This is mostly because these details do not nearly weigh as much as the general understanding of the product, which is content-delivery and serverless computing. In my view, the economic consequence of these architectures far outweighs any other metric that could measure the future value of a company like Fastly. Most of my DD writing follows this principal; I'm far more focused on economic consequences and incentives of an industry player rather than data-points that can be fixed in time like a recent earnings or financial report. Those things need to just check out."

2021-05-01 22:26:46,wallstreetbets,"So, I can see that OP has done research and seems to know a good bit about what they are talking about. 

My key problem is that your basis for this being a solid pick is a google acquisition (however in one of your imagines you have google competing with fastly) 

Why would google (who has their own platform) consider buying out fastly? 

You explain why both fastly and cloudfare are important but you (from the bit I read) don't go specifically into why google would buy them out. 

This is much like making the jump to say Amazon is going to buy out every super market because they are doing contactless check out. Could they? Probably, but that's a misunderstanding of the point of their tech. (They aren't necessarily interested in physical super markets, they're interested in a non contact tech, that can detect thief so that they can offer this service to other stores. Remember how amazon already has a delivery service that does food as well?)

AWS has Route53 and Cloudfront and have been taking lots of marketshare from cloudflare of late.  I can anecdotally confirm from my tech peers.  Also many large companies prefer one vendor and AWS is also cheaper to boot.

As you know Managers/Execs aren't often tech-savvy and many wouldn't even understand the benefits of Fastly and simply go with AWS.  I do like Fastly and will probably pick some up but i'm not sure how they will do in a tech downturn combined with competitive pressure from the gorillas.  Thoughts?"

&#x200B;

Fastly is definitely the cheaper option but still by no means a bargain. 291MM revenue with 7.25B market cap. They grow revenue slightly slower and have worse gross margins..

For the record, this is one of the more technical DDs I'll have to write."
2021-05-02 02:23:29,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn’t say nobody uses it.

AWS pushes it heavily on clients and serverless experience appears frequently in software job ads as a requirement.

I agree on a tech level it doesn’t solve some of the problems it says it solves and introduces over complexities of its own so I have used serverless sparingly.

As a service provider though I would say it makes perfect business sense. You can more efficiently utilise your hardware resources so not sat idle 99% of the time, you couple the customer to integrating with other services you sell I.e. api gateway, blob storage etc so get vendor lock-in in everything but name. This is why the big three cloud provides are pushing it so hard.

Cloudfront serverless option seems more feature complete right now. It has KV (data storage) and durable workers, again a data storage option and scheduled events.

Reading fastly’s docs they do not have any data storage or scheduling functionality yet and these would be very big requirements for it to really take off as a serverless platform. Likewise Fastly is very early in the supported languages.

As a CDN fastly looks to have the edge. As a general purpose platform today for CDN and serverless Cloudflare looks to be ahead feature wise."
2021-05-02 14:40:30,wallstreetbets,"You are very wrong in assuming no one uses it. 50% of my conversations with large scale enterprises and lower have indicated that they are moving more of their work loads into severless environments like fargate.

2021-05-02 06:33:24,wallstreetbets,"> * Incredibly expensive

Sure, if you use it wrong. There's contexts in which it's dramatically cheaper. Cloud services as a whole tend to be dramatically price inelastic, because efficiency gains are stacked up against folks making a ton of money. We have an average small-company AWS bill, around 80k a month. If my team focused on it and cared, we could happily drop that to 10k/mo by self hosting things. Doing so would mean adding another 3-4 SREs at 200k+. 

> Terrible spin up times

is a design consideration that's top of mind for anyone implementing it. Warming, or design, solve. 

> Messy disjointed code base

What? Yes, I wouldn't necessarily call every platform a full candidate. If you're architecting your platform around trends and not...you know, what you actually need, it'll sprawl. 

> High probability of vender lock in

I see you're unfamiliar with hosted services as a whole. Nearly everything AWS or GCP does as a hosted service encourages lock in. That is a) a reasonably good case for profitability, and b) the status quo for both platforms, which is why both are so obviously losing money hand over fist. 

 > Networking is an absolute disaster

This sounds like a personal problem? Primary serverless services use the networking of their native platforms. I guess if you have trouble implementing GCP/AWS networking, but....how is that at all hard? 

> Non adaptability

Not even sure what you mean with that last one."

Read this article and tell me that BB is not smack bang in the middle of this. 

1) Auto companies increasingly focused on software to optimize car performance and deliver on demand services. This is the way things are going and this trend towards a connected “smart” car is only accelerating. 

2) Safety and security are key when it comes to introducing software into vehicles. And this shit is super complex so no reasonable Auto OEM (except maybe TSLA) will try to develop a proprietary in house software solution at significant cost. 

3) Luckily there is also a superb off the shelf solution to OEM’s available in the form of QNX and IVY. BB quietly worked on this over the past years without getting any attention and now BB is the de facto leader in automotive software solutions with safety and security a key competence of the firm. 

4) Now its time to monetize all that hard work. BB already has 23/25 of the global auto OEMs signed up as customers so we will begin to see these partnerships translate into sales. In the next 5 years most if not all new cars will have some kind of BB software embedded inside.

2021-05-01 23:24:47,wallstreetbets,"Good job doing some homework and applying what you learned.  


Selling cash-secured put was great in February and early March. IV fading out now. GME IV relatively high compared to other stocks, but not compared to its own January - February history.  


PLBY has very similar IV with more frequent down strike days for selling CSPs."
2021-05-02 02:42:42,wallstreetbets,how does this even work 🤔
2021-05-02 03:15:02,wallstreetbets,"Congrats and fuck you. Now roll the gains into going long.

Worst case, you get an awesome loss porn post.

Win/win"
2021-05-01 20:45:42,wallstreetbets,Are you waiting at expiration for the full premium or do you stop after 50% profit? In other words what's the exit strategy? Put/call credit spread?
2021-05-01 23:03:55,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-02 01:59:11,wallstreetbets,Don’t forget to order a side of AMC
2021-05-02 02:33:33,wallstreetbets,"I made about 135K writing CC on GME the past 2 months (I started selling after the FEB pop), but stopped the past two weeks.  
Ever since the IV dropped significantly, I can't justify risking the upside for a relatively small amount of premiums."

2021-05-01 20:23:01,wallstreetbets,With a gamble like that you are bound to win!
2021-05-01 20:38:13,wallstreetbets,If I make $100k of these GME stocks. I’m sucking my own cock!
2021-05-02 14:31:31,wallstreetbets,That’s what you get for selling PUTS on GME!  Deserved it.
2021-05-02 03:47:41,wallstreetbets,"I had my first covered call get exercised and called away on Friday. I was a bit aggressive selling it near the money and unfortunately did so right before GME had a nice spike from $155 to $185+. Oh well, I still received close to $1,000 in premium."
2021-05-01 23:42:18,wallstreetbets,"The drop in IV has definitely been unfortunate. Like you said, still high compared to most other stocks, but a far cry from the glory days of February and March. Call premium is still decent if you catch a good upswing and sell close to the money, around $2k if you go 2 weeks out. I might sell a 11/15 $125 call this week for shits and grins. I'll either get blown up if GME stays high or goes higher, or I'll get some disgusting premium and it'll settle just below $125 in the next 6 months."
2021-05-01 21:07:11,wallstreetbets,"Generally I have been buying to close at 50%+ profit. I let my covered call this past week go to expiration and call my shares away because the premium was a bit weak and I wanted to get every last penny. My strategy is running a covered strangle. Sell covered calls on one end, sell cash secured puts on the other. My biggest win was a $180C and a $170P that I opened a few weeks back. GME closed that Friday at something like $178. Made like 8k total between the two."
2021-05-02 03:49:56,wallstreetbets,"Ehhh I've made about $2,000 on AMC. I sell some puts on it here and there, but don't have much love for it."
2021-05-02 18:17:33,wallstreetbets,"Biggest one-day move since early March was, what, 50%? Sell at or around that and you're still getting a hundred or two bucks per contract."
2021-05-02 17:32:18,wallstreetbets,Ooooof. Sell covered calls to get some premium and lower your cost basis.
2021-05-01 20:15:48,wallstreetbets,I think that's good advice but hope it goes higher. Cheapest CC I sold was at 260. Not as high a premium but I don't really want to lose my shares
2021-05-01 20:10:18,wallstreetbets,"Just had my first call exercise yesterday as it ended in the money. Normally I am rolling out for a credit on what theta has already earned me for profit. I don't mind getting the 100 shares called away, I'll just buy some more when GME has a bit of a dip"

2021-05-01 20:55:35,wallstreetbets,"This is confusing. You're calling op an ape, yet saying he's going to miss the squeeze.

2021-05-01 20:14:33,wallstreetbets,You sure are stupid - even for a GME fella
2021-05-01 20:10:43,wallstreetbets,dude
2021-05-02 13:05:23,wallstreetbets,15 other dumbasses who don’t understand simple math upvoted this stupid comments as well
2021-05-01 22:58:44,wallstreetbets,Sadly that only works if you got the 15k for it
2021-05-01 23:45:37,wallstreetbets,I have so much to learn
2021-05-02 03:01:28,wallstreetbets,How do you do that? What is that?
2021-05-01 20:01:02,wallstreetbets,I have 300 GME shares at Merill Edge but I don’t know how to play with options. I will stick to Buy and Hold that is all I know. Good luck to u OP 👍
2021-05-02 13:40:47,wallstreetbets,The reward would have been much more than 65k if he just bought long and held.
2021-05-02 03:59:46,wallstreetbets,Wow. And of course you locked in those share profits from the spike as well. Cant wait to save up a few more bucks so I can have an effective theta gang strat.
2021-05-01 22:14:26,wallstreetbets,Thank you my good sir
2021-05-02 12:27:36,wallstreetbets,Quick question. I just had my shares called away on Friday too and was wondering if you plan to just buy another 100 shares outright on a down day or will you be doing weekly itm/otm CSP?
2021-05-01 23:55:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I have no idea how to read it TBH. I thought you had 11000 shares, and were selling cc and naked puts like a true yolo retard.

During Jan Feb, I made over 320k selling naked puts and used those premium to buy more GME, those were the best 2 months of my trading career...so far."

2021-05-01 23:10:41,wallstreetbets,"Do you have $15,000+ to park in cash to actually *secure* the put option at a $150 strike? If not, you can't."
2021-05-02 16:13:30,wallstreetbets,"You take $15,000 and then write a promise (contract) to someone that you'd buy 100 shares of GME for $150 each up to a certain day. They hand you some cash (the premium) and then walk away. 

If GME stays above $150/share then you're fine. Contract expires, your money is secure and you've gained the premium. Cool.

If GME tanks below $150/share then that contract's getting exercised and you're going to be buying 100 shares of GME at $150 each regardless of what it's trading at in the larger market."
2021-05-01 22:28:14,wallstreetbets,70k made off 90k is good. Like seriously you are dumber than retard
2021-05-01 20:12:55,wallstreetbets,"My bigger fear is that it skyrockets but just f for a day or two and I get my shares called away. Otherwise, I would sell all in covered calls but I keep 2/3 just in the clear each week and then regret it when the week ends and I left so much on the table. Constant balancing act"
2021-05-01 23:00:47,wallstreetbets,"There's so many institutions owning this stock now that any big move is brought right back. Volume has gotten crazy low though lately, but still it hasn't moved much."
2021-05-02 17:39:48,wallstreetbets,"I'm on the fence myself, haven't decided either way. Part of me wants to sell an aggressively-priced CSP to hopefully get some shares on discount, but then I have to wait all week to see if I actually get the shares."

2021-05-02 04:28:41,wallstreetbets,Your previous comment suggests other wise. And all the money you made? That means you sold at some point. Not diamond handed if you sold.
2021-05-01 20:19:26,wallstreetbets,"The only thing you're right about is that GME is not a $12B company. They're worth a lot more than that. You will see. Even if you don't believe any of the Citadel shenanigans, there are officially 12 million shares short that need to be covered and the price keeps going up.

If you're putting money behind your opinion that GME is going back to $40... I can't wait to see you lose your shirt."
2021-05-02 12:06:46,wallstreetbets,I'll have to keep that in mind!
2021-05-01 20:08:21,wallstreetbets,What is sell?
2021-05-01 22:26:06,wallstreetbets,u/actuarythrowaway445 I think I’m a bit more skeptical than the typical GME ape but the moment DFV bought another 50k shares at ~$150 each that completely buttressed my faith in the stock at that price point as a floor for the near to mid-term.
2021-05-01 23:33:04,wallstreetbets,Do you actually think gme is undervalued?
2021-05-01 21:21:07,wallstreetbets,"That is a way to like the stonk probably not the way, but it is a way"
2021-05-01 20:45:32,wallstreetbets,"The price goes up and down daily and shorts move in and out daily. There is no law that says once you setup a short position you can't close it 5 minutes later when the price moves $0.25 or doesn't move at all.

While I believe it's a $40 based on fundamentals I have puts setup so if the stock dips to $120 some time between now and Oct I profit, and while I wait for that to play out, I'm making weekly profit selling covered calls on shares I own. I'm planning on getting more shares soon to sell more covered calls because that is clearly where the smart money is on this."
2021-05-01 20:20:30,wallstreetbets,"Only selling CC, not the stock. Been holding it since December. Bought @ 15.45"
2021-05-01 22:39:30,wallstreetbets,"How do you know he hasn't sold since then?  Copying an investor only works when you can time your trades exactly to theirs.

Also, even the most brilliant investors make mistakes.  You should make decisions based on your own reasoning."
2021-05-02 02:16:42,wallstreetbets,"Oh yes, certainly. 

* payed off their dept
* sitting on about $700 million
* has a solid revenue ($8Bn - 10$Bn/ year)
* huge brand value (most talked about company)
* increasing TAM (gaming and eSports)
* customer base ready for online purchases
* online retail transition already happening

Last but certainly not least:

* SOLID board of directory with legit superstars poached from $AMZN, Google and Chewy (including Ryan Cohen, of course)

All the above for a $11Bn market cap. My 100% based on logic evaluation sits around $35Bn now. NOT including any squeeze."
2021-05-01 22:57:33,wallstreetbets,No theres also risk it does squeeze while his calls are out and he loses out on whatever it goes to for say 220 a share.
2021-05-01 21:50:30,wallstreetbets,Eat my dingus
2021-05-01 21:26:06,wallstreetbets,Similar! And with the premiums collected I've been able to add a few more shares.

2021-05-01 22:43:03,wallstreetbets,"Doesn’t matter what I think about the stock. All that matters is what I think other people think about the stock. And what I think is that other people think it’s important that DFV bought at $150. If you think pure fundamental analysis sans technical or sentimental analysis is still a viable way to play stocks these days, I wish you the best."
2021-05-02 04:14:27,wallstreetbets,"Superstars that came over to this brick and mortar shit show only to be paid in stock, no less...  the same people that surely said to themselves “Self, you gotten this far in life making reckless and dangerous decision...  this seems like an extremely illogical choice... and I like it!”"
2021-05-02 09:44:44,wallstreetbets,"lol I can't tell if your trolling or serious. 

they had 8b in revenue in 2019. Look at future expectations for revenue( around 5b). Why would you value a mature brick and mortar retailer based on revenue? You don't even mention earnings per share)but at least you might get positive earnings/share in 2024!

11bn market cap for brick and mortar retail for an industry that is being digitized and will eventually make discs close to obsolete. GME has no brand value-being the ""most talked about"" company is irrelevant. 

You just randomly spewed off some opinions and then concluded that the company should be worth 3x what its currently priced. Show me how you got to 35b valuation."
2021-05-01 22:52:33,wallstreetbets,First time options seller here too and have had some modest gains and it's a lot of fun! Gme high iv has made me super greedy and spoiled 🤑 keep us posted if you find anymore high iv stocks! Congrats on your success!
2021-05-02 11:28:15,wallstreetbets,The hands are diamond with this one 🤣🦧🦍
2021-05-01 22:45:08,wallstreetbets,"If you read my other comments I don't think it's just fundamentals.

This chain started with my comment that ""no one else will sell"" may be flawed for a number of reasons.  Every inflated asset in history has people believing that ""everyone else think it's going to be valuable so it is valuable.""  This looks different, but it isn't.  History doesn't repeat exactly but it sure fucking rhymes."
2021-05-02 07:57:10,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I think they came over because of someone they've worked with and believe in. And if he doesn't become CEO in the next year, I'd be damned surprised.

If that guy gets named CEO, then this stock will be considered a value at $250. Just my 0.02"
2021-05-02 13:30:56,wallstreetbets,"Not trolling - was trying to be very clear 🙂 main reasons for my positivity is that I believe in the future of the company, based on the facts already given.

Not speaking of earnings, as they are lacking... Obviously. 
I'm not investing my money in brick and mortar 2019 GameStop; I'm investing in eSport-venue and prime gaming hub 2022 GameStop."
2021-05-01 23:38:46,wallstreetbets,"Of course some people will sell, but if you just glance at this board you can see that waaaay more people than normal will hold.  This situation isn’t your average situation, like with other stocks."
2021-05-01 23:48:53,wallstreetbets,"They will hold until they won't.  Retail won't move this stock ultimately anyway.  It will be the large whales, CC writers, and institutions that move this stock.

It's helpful to them that lots of retail wants to hold.  

In any case it isn't unreasonable to sell CC's on this belief but IMO chances are it will pop at some point and most retail will be too late after the drop to sell.  Godspeed and good luck though, no one can predict exactly when that will happen."
2021-05-02 00:58:42,wallstreetbets,"Retail looks to BE the largest whale, gtfo w the FUD."
2021-05-02 01:24:01,wallstreetbets,"Ehh public data says institutional holders have way more shares but you know what... but believe what you want.

Best of luck to you."
2021-05-01 22:21:56,wallstreetbets,Verb sounds drunk
2021-05-02 10:31:20,wallstreetbets,There are synthetic shares that get created over the course of trading for liquidity purposes by the market makers and then there are real voting shares. Retail by and large own real voting shares. On a day to day basis there’s no diff but when events happen they do make a diff. Don’t worry about it.
2021-05-02 12:59:45,wallstreetbets,I think we need more drones following Citadel employee houses tbh.

2021-05-02 16:35:06,wallstreetbets,"Part of what shot them to $40 was announcing a dividend after earnings, so it was a combination of shorts covering and a FOMO runup.  The price eventually went back down to the 20-24 range it was stuck at prior to the runup."

Im predicting they notch down to $75-$80. Best case scenario is now in the past for them and they are left with what they capitalized on during covid, and tbh they dropped the ball. Sure they grew user base when they were essentially everyones only option for a workout, but most fo those users weren't able to work out in their usual setting and were always planning to be temporary Peletoners until they could get back to normal. Now that they can, PTON stock is fucked. They should have capitalized on the reopening also and finally got an out of home concept in play, or something to give them some longevity."

However,  the online imaginary numbers we all have, God knows where that goes. Another thought. When my dad was in his 30s (he is 60 now) some whack job ""boomer"" use to tell him ""you best get into gold while you can"". Dad, laughed, as did everyone else bc  it was just a metal of ancient days gone by such as the gold rush, and there's absolutely no way it will be worth buying... so, no one did. That man who suggested this also use to dig through the dumpsters at the AFB and take out scrap gold wire. Long story short... that mans son is friggin loaded.  He is dead but still, bc he had a hunch, and bought ""worthless metal"" instead of buying trusts & bonds (the winners back then) he quadrupled his money. A) metal will continue to go up... slowly but ALWAYS goes up with the dollar where as the dollar may not. B) sometimes nutcase bear boomers are right C) GME is not always the answer.

2021-05-02 09:01:59,wallstreetbets,Take a look at the DD on this reddit about a month ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbx510/slv_is_a_complete_scam_its_a_scalp_trade_set_up/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
2021-05-01 21:06:19,wallstreetbets,"It's the day of a raid. The squeeze will come when it comes, brought about by sustained buying pressure. Or you could say it is ongoing"
2021-05-01 23:18:22,wallstreetbets,There was DD on this about 2 months ago talking about JPM and paper silver funds were artificially keeping prices suppressed even as the guy who owns all the silver mines was basically about to engage in a Scrooge McDuck simulation with silver.
2021-05-02 05:48:11,wallstreetbets,"Exactly... so buy it low, store it. It may dip but eventually it'll go up higher. Thats metals"
2021-05-02 19:51:17,wallstreetbets,Unless you own PSLV
2021-05-02 10:23:23,wallstreetbets,"Incorrect. Only ""Authorized Particpants,"" e.g. JP Morgan,  can withdraw from SLV."
2021-05-02 08:39:35,wallstreetbets,SLV takes that physical silver and then issues hundreds of sell orders against each unit. It is sketch paper short garbage.
2021-05-01 21:07:10,wallstreetbets,"""backed"""
2021-05-02 14:50:34,wallstreetbets,"People are downvoting because there is no trust that SLV isnt a paper shuffling scam, and buying it gives more ammo for the market riggers to hold the price down. Look at who's behind SLV. PSLV is a closed fund with reputable men behind the company. SLV changed their perspectus the day after the last silver squeeze to basically give them an 'out' if there is a shortage in physical, SLV might crash and all holders would no longer have exposure to silver, and the cash value ""may diverge significantly from the spot price"" of silver"
2021-05-02 16:03:28,wallstreetbets,"u/ogpine0325 The silver backing SLV is probably there but there’s no clue as to how many times it has been rehypothecated. Yes you can theoretically redeem 50k shares, but have you tried?"
2021-05-02 12:18:45,wallstreetbets,PSLV is
2021-05-02 19:53:57,wallstreetbets,So you are long silver only not gold as well?
2021-05-02 13:42:54,wallstreetbets,Wack what the heck 🤣
2021-05-02 11:58:03,wallstreetbets,"Interesting. Wonder if it had to do with taste, since gold is softer and more likely to be ingested than aluminum"
2021-05-02 11:59:16,wallstreetbets,"Uh what? I’ve been WSB for a few years, in GME since Nov, (about $14). And yeah, i ain’t fucking touching silver because it’s an equal sum currency and it ain’t that scarce."
2021-05-01 21:33:24,wallstreetbets,The real question:  **HOW** is raid day...
2021-05-01 23:20:43,wallstreetbets,Its when UBRS is open to all
2021-05-02 14:45:53,wallstreetbets,Remind me in 2 years when biden is still president how the My pillow guy and Rudy “the vampire crook” Giuliani convinced people 6 months after an election that there was still voter fraud against one of the most unpopular presidents in US history 😀🤣
2021-05-02 13:19:32,wallstreetbets,You don’t seem to understand the simple behavior of supply and demand or your just trolling. Because right now commodities are cheap so when they go up like everything other sector has holding them will be profitable.
2021-05-01 20:58:31,wallstreetbets,Aloe? Does aloe have silver in it?
2021-05-02 13:56:14,wallstreetbets,Bruh...Check my user history going back 6 yrs on reddit talking about silver. Been stacking way longer than that even. Before anyone ever heard of meme stocks. Bag-holder 🙄
2021-05-02 13:56:28,wallstreetbets,That’s so metal
2021-05-01 21:10:05,wallstreetbets,"Well the fund managers hold physical silver in their vaults and its up for grabs by investors with 50,000 shares or more so... Yes by definition it is ""backed"" by silver. Never said it was 100% backed. Just that it was. That's what I get for saying something legit in this sub full of morons."
2021-05-02 14:03:53,wallstreetbets,"No, it was because aluminum was more rare than gold in those days."
2021-05-02 14:01:38,wallstreetbets,"I didnt ask you to either so wtf you on some im important look at me comment shit for? Dont buy, buy,... I dont care"
2021-05-02 00:20:50,wallstreetbets,Why is raid day?
2021-05-02 16:48:35,wallstreetbets,Watch and see. It starts this month. This isnt just Q and politics. This is Christian prophecy.
2021-05-01 21:01:30,wallstreetbets,If your doctor prescribes you Aloe for a severe burn you’ll have a strong malpractice case on your hands.
2021-05-02 02:02:03,wallstreetbets,The fund managers hold the silver then short the shit out of it. It's a scalp trade.
2021-05-01 21:26:20,wallstreetbets,PSLV is 100% backed by silver. There is no good reason to buy slv over pslv unless you want to fuck with options
2021-05-02 15:22:37,wallstreetbets,"I think I read something like they own the silver that is used to back the stock already, just in a different storage, so instead of buying more they just move silver between storages. Thus buying SLV doesn’t increase market pressures. Don’t have a source though so that might be wrong."
2021-05-02 14:54:17,wallstreetbets,Checks out.
2021-05-02 14:52:18,wallstreetbets,"You made a dumb ass statement, I refuted it. It’s a public forum retard."

2021-05-01 21:08:56,wallstreetbets,K whats the most effective burn cream then?
2021-05-01 21:28:39,wallstreetbets,"Point to where I said SLV would be a better investment. The original commenter said SLV was paper silver, which objectively is not the case."
2021-05-02 15:20:31,wallstreetbets,It’s weird to think about. Now we toss it in the trash like it’s nothing.
2021-05-01 21:11:02,wallstreetbets,Silver sulfadiazine
2021-05-02 02:02:20,wallstreetbets,It is paper.
2021-05-02 10:10:08,wallstreetbets,It is objectively the case when they sell the same piece of silver hundreds of times. Which they’ve objectively done. And that’s why they were objectively fined nearly a BILLION DOLLARS for it. You objectively didn’t read the DD or you would know this. That’s why you’re being downvoted into oblivion. So stop defending SLV. It’s nothing but a lie. Objectively.
2021-05-02 16:25:13,wallstreetbets,Lol right! Not so scarce anymore with modern technology though.
2021-05-02 08:52:16,wallstreetbets,"No longer used for 2nd degree burns. but still widely used for 3rd degree burns. “There is insufficient evidence to establish whether silver-containing dressings or topical agents promote wound healing or prevent wound infection"".[7] Other reviews of the evidence have also concluded, ""[the] quality of the trials was limited"". is not recommended for most burns due to altered wound appearance and the frequency of required dressing changes.

Sounds like outdated medicine to me but this is just a quick look into that product but its not looking good."
2021-05-02 02:10:23,wallstreetbets,No. It's not fucking paper. And I've already explained why.
2021-05-02 11:11:03,wallstreetbets,"“Silver sulfadiazine cream is used to prevent and treat wound infections in patients with second- and third-degree burns. Patients with severe burns or burns over a large area of the body must be treated in a hospital. Silver sulfadiazine is an antibiotic. It works by killing the bacteria or preventing its growth.”

Not sure what quack website you pulled yours from. Mine is from the Mayo Clinic. https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/silver-sulfadiazine-topical-route/proper-use/drg-20068819?p=1"
2021-05-02 08:43:38,wallstreetbets,There's approx. 200 times the amount of paper to silver in SLV.
2021-05-02 04:01:09,wallstreetbets,It is paper when they turn around and short futures. People buying SLV are getting robbed.
2021-05-02 12:51:19,wallstreetbets,"I am not a burn doctor nor do I have first-hand knowledge about treating 2nd or 3rd degree burns. However, claiming silver is better than aloe is a faulty statement. Aloe has been used for thousands of years to treat burns and other inflammation.

Sources saying SSD ( Silver sulfadiazine) shows the same or inferior results compared to aloe or other creams are plentiful with studies performed as recently as late 2020. There are studies done by the Mayoclinic itself, American Burn Association, the director of the International Drug Information Center, etc. that all support this claim. If you think silver is a wise investment then you should at least know counter-arguments to its value rather than dismissing them as wrong without research.

Source (with multiple sources used for information and related studies at the bottom) 
https://www.drugtopics.com/view/reevaluating-the-use-of-silver-sulfadiazine-cream-in-the-management-of-burns

You will find the same info on the wikipedia for SSD with links to studies supporting the claim. If you have any studies refuting those claims then those would be worth looking into.

If you have a link to how much SSD is purchased/used per year that would be a quick way to understand its current usage."

2021-05-01 22:04:48,wallstreetbets,"A 1 minute google, brings me to  **Nano Dimension** (NASDAQ:[**NNDM**](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/nndm-stock-quote/)), an Israeli 3D technology firm with just $400,000 in revenue in its last quarter, has raised over $1.4 billion in the past six months. The company seems to be in the business of raising cash through equity offerings. Now the market has caught on and its cash-raising business could be over for NNDM stock.    
 So, in a weird sort of twist, NNDM has become a de facto SPAC, with only the shell of an underlying tech business. This is because cash is its major asset."
2021-05-01 21:25:02,wallstreetbets,"500 shares - $8.32 average

Selling covered calls and collecting premiums.

3x May 21 $10, 2x June 18 $10

Queen Cathie is never wrong. Not worried about the offerings. This company has enough cash to weather any storm and crush M&A and R&D. Hoping the wsb crew hops aboard. Gonna be very fun squeezing these shorts."
2021-05-01 20:29:49,wallstreetbets,"So this company did $4M in revenue in 2020 and has had numerous stock offerings (dilution) this year?  Seems like a real winner......

248M shares outstanding X 7.37/share = $1.8B valuation on $4 M in revenue???

Oh and that recent acquisition?  Appears that both companies have some of the same board members.  That makes it a little sketchy."
2021-05-01 21:28:40,wallstreetbets,"God no, don't let WSB hype this stock up. I will say the company isn't ""burning cash"". It's got enough for many years."
2021-05-01 21:42:47,wallstreetbets,Great analysis! 7.40 seems like a buy

2021-05-02 18:37:23,wallstreetbets,Yessssss let's send it.
2021-05-02 18:56:10,wallstreetbets,"I used to be a huge fan of Cathy and ARK....she is smart but her stock picks I have been questioning in this market.  This year is going to be quite different than last year in regards to the stock market.  Inflation, increased interest rates, etc.... not sure we will see confidence come back. Shorts and hedge funds are heavy and every time stocks pop they sell off.  Even good earnings are selling off.  Techs, small caps, mid caps all struggling. Owned NNDM  at $3 and rode it up to $17 and like an idiot didnt sell all of it.   Just sold it at $8 last week and now going to sit on the side lines.  ARK adding NNDM WKHS SPCE AQB PLTR and SKLZ  all getting  crushed.  Just my opinion on speculative stocks now .    Looks like $6.60 incoming, where I may add back.  Also in addition,  calling an article from Investors place is really sad.   Not sure. I know anyone who read that crap...  They nothing but click and bait articles.  Its like quoting bullish You Tube videos!  Hahaha. Good luck"
2021-05-02 12:37:09,wallstreetbets,I'm flabbergasted everyone thinks this is a good short term hold. If you know anything about additive manufacturing you know 3d printed electronics are far down the line as far as maturity. I went to a Wohlers associates investors dinner and they plugged anything laser powder bed fusion. Hint hint velo3d. Aerospace and medical are the hot AM applications. Applications drive the value creation in AM. Follow the money.
2021-05-02 01:38:50,wallstreetbets,Problem is they used that cash from the offerings to acquire a company that was owned by a board members sister......I don’t like the stonk
2021-05-01 20:40:55,wallstreetbets,You saw what happened in March with the last earnings? I’m not saying it’ll happen again but honestly I think terrible earnings numbers are expected and may be priced in. Who knows...guess we will know after earnings.
2021-05-01 21:31:11,wallstreetbets,They have more acquisitions incoming.

2021-05-02 14:16:04,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the input - As I had posted, I gave a few ""short term"" catalysts, just events that are happening soon that curious investors should at least take note of. Other then that, It's not like the company will fly to some sky-high valuation anytime soon. I am slightly bullish short term, as I did state a position I had include May calls. Other than that, I'm long on the company. I think as they continue to acquire other companies, their current valuation will almost be considered ""undervalued"", so I do believe this is a good buy-in price. For anyone who does follow Cathie Wood, she invests long term. Not short term."
2021-05-02 03:13:34,wallstreetbets,Thats not necessarily a bad thing as long as the sister is competent.

2021-05-01 21:42:02,wallstreetbets,Good ones or most likely bad ones (like the current e xample)
2021-05-02 18:07:39,wallstreetbets,"He said it in an AMA, I think actually on this subreddit. It would take me a minute to find it"
2021-05-02 08:33:11,wallstreetbets,"Because the company isn't generating profit / revenue relative to its size, however that's using the traditional valuation method. Look at big techs like tesla and other unicorns, did traditional valuation methods work?"
2021-05-02 14:33:00,wallstreetbets,"I mean sure it's decent but there's hundreds of other good stock plays. Cathies got better ones to follow just cause she bought them doesn't mean it's a sure thing. Despite having a 3d printing etf I don't think she's an expert on the topic just bullish on the industry as a whole. I kinda agree with the mindset of betting on the industry leaders if you're long. The electronic 3d printing subsector is tiny right now. Sure there's a lot of potential but if you're gonna be timing the market ride the wave with what's hot. What's hot in 3d printing is metals metals metals right now. Desktop metal just bought Envision tech and they're stock price got hammered lately. That would be a miles better play than NNDM. NNDM really got lucky being a meme stock/short squeeze whatever happened and they did good capitalizing on it. If that didn't happen they woulda been on the struggle bus for a long time. Their only customers rn are universities because the only thing this is good for is research. It's not gonna scale till at least 2030 bet. So if you're going long be prepared to wait and have an exit strategy because if it spikes it's not gonna be a plateau. Like I said sure they can be revolutionary but being too early you miss out on so many other things. I'm not touching NNDM with a 10 foot pool because most people sorely misunderstand 3d printing and don't know the first thing about it or the industry. 

For instance people say GE is a boomer stock but little do they know GE additive is pretty damn good tech which they leverage for the LEAP fuel nozzle. They don't have competition because of that and people are never gonna stop buying their engines especially because of American protectionism. Like I said applications are the value creator in AM. 3d printed electronics don't create any value right now and won't for YEARS. About acquisitions the TAM for microfabrication is pretty small too and still in research phase. Trust me I know. I tried to mass produce micro-orings via 3d printing and it's goddamn difficult and near impossible at this stage. Go ahead and invest in them but don't bet the farm. Good luck. It could work out for you but it's not my cup of tea."
2021-05-01 22:02:30,wallstreetbets,I think now that SPAC prices are decreasing they might get better and/or more acquisitions.
2021-05-02 05:29:32,wallstreetbets,Bunch of retards think everything is squeezable. Just like apes learning a new vocab applying it everywhere.

2021-05-02 11:57:38,wallstreetbets,"I think valuations are a tricky way to price a stock. Yes, the company has a 2bil valuation for almost no sales, but this is because they are looking to the future. If they prove to be successful, as you mentioned Tesla, then a higher valuation isn’t out of the question."
2021-05-02 07:36:49,wallstreetbets,When you’ve got a hammer...
2021-05-02 12:08:21,wallstreetbets,"Yup, in Asia we call these companies as those who ""sell their dreams"". The difference here is it's not just selling dreams, they are actually taking steps and materialising them. Which then makes it difficult to understand why has it been shorted. One could argue its undergoing massive institutional accumulation, which we will know when the funds holding data are updated."
2021-05-01 20:42:04,wallstreetbets,"Sure, sure, and these guys always tell you the truth at the time. He says no more offerings now but if they need more money in a few months, he can say “circumstances have changed”"
2021-05-02 12:21:37,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. I believe if I saw correctly in Q4 2020, Nano Dimension had big institutional buys (before it peaked). Not sure about Q1 this year. Also, when they did their offerings they were direct offerings. So big money got shares cheap (at the time). Curious if they sold by now. Earnings will improve once they acquire a big company, I can’t wait to see when and who. Then people will wonder why the shorts were so confident..."

2021-05-02 00:48:43,wallstreetbets,I thought MVIS was dead after bad earnings ? Or are all the mentions about MVIS from people bag holding??
2021-05-02 18:53:57,wallstreetbets,"As someone who tripple bagged with MVIS calls after WSB sentiment was hyped AF about an April press release with details of their new lidar solution, and then double bagged with CLOV calls after everyone posting DD and talking about The Whitehouse's upcoming announcement of the The American Families Plan, I disagree with you based on empirical evidence."
2021-05-02 12:43:12,wallstreetbets,"My thoughts exactly. These seem to be lagging indicators that the play is already made. My theory is its because people are forking discords and subreddits about plays, and don't come to WSB to talk about them until they need people to hold their bags."
2021-05-01 20:10:25,wallstreetbets,I think most of those mentions would have been people talking about their losses or gains. There was definitely DD here before it climbed.

2021-05-01 21:40:56,wallstreetbets,"remind you when what? GME tanks and I lose $5000 out of the ~65k that I made on it? lmfao get a grip. 

but yeah, bet its higher in 2 months and that's why I still have 50 shares in at ~100/per cost basis. this will be a fun conversation."
2021-05-02 04:20:46,wallstreetbets,"Shorts didn't cover. It's not really QAnon conspiracy, it's as simple as HF would lie and take ~~a fine~~ the cost of business as they have many times before."
2021-05-02 06:59:21,wallstreetbets,"All data points to less shares shorted. 

People thinking there will be a 'name your price' event are deranged. If this was the case another HF could pour in a ton of money into gme to wipeout other HF who are shorting gme"
2021-05-02 10:51:23,wallstreetbets,"Could, but how much would they need to dump into it? When would the shorts get margin called? Nobody knows that. Wouldn't it be cheaper and smarter for them to just wait too, since they know apes and other longs are holding? Why would they take such a huge risk when at any point upon getting close to margin call anyone who is long could sell, taking profits, pull the rug out from under them and fuck them over when all they need to do is buy and hold?"
2021-05-02 11:02:19,wallstreetbets,"IF it's as shorted as you people think it is, it would be very easy for some rival HF to drive up the price and make it even more expensive for them to hold and thus forcing shorts to cover faster and cause a squeeze. 

Look how much Hwang drove up price of Viac and Disc for 'proof of concept.' 

The fact that a HF isn't doing this makes me believe y'all are completely wrong about short squeeze potential and the numbers of like 20% short are correct. 

I don't know how much GME should be worth, but I think there wont be another squeeze."
2021-05-02 11:53:06,wallstreetbets,"But if they're lying about the si and willing to take the fine instead of the alternative, the rival HFs wouldn't know how much they need to spend to drive it up because they don't know what the ""real"" si. I don't see a HF taking such a huge risk when they can simply hold as well. Viac and Disc have 10x the float size and don't have the ape factor either. Could be a reason why certain HFs may have felt the need to take things into their own hands with those stocks and not GME. Who knows though"
2021-05-02 13:13:16,wallstreetbets,"Reread what you just wrote lol.

This is on the same level as QAnon shit."
2021-05-02 13:18:02,wallstreetbets,"How? Citadel has been hit with 58 measely fines in the past for illegal activity, including falsely reporting. Why is it so farfetched to think they would lie about it again and longs would prefer to hold and wait them out rather than spend a ton of money trying to force a squeeze? Especially when everyone else could very well sell for profit before margin call even happens and fuck them over."
2021-05-02 13:28:43,wallstreetbets,"The shorts covered buddy, and it’s not citadel that reports SI.

Every single point of data shows shorts covered, some when the fucking stock 20x’d in a week on massive volume, which was the craziest short squeeze in all of history.

You have to make up this retarded narrative with no evidence to back it up in order for your theory to make any sense. That is literally Q’anon, and citadel getting fined for doing shady shit is not evidence of anything.

Is it possible? Maybe there’s a one in a trillion chance...but people who were dumb enough to listen to objectively wrong DD were probably gonna lose their money in the market anyways."
2021-05-02 13:40:32,wallstreetbets,"It's not really a narrative or in depth QAnon conspiracy though. Just the idea that shorts didn't completely cover. It *is* Citadel that reports their short position, as well as every other shorting hedge fund, and FINRA releases the total report. If the shorting hedge funds would rather lie and take a negligible fine than suffer a squeeze (again, something Citadel has been guilty of and fined for in the past) FINRA would unknowingly be releasing false numbers. Appreciate the counter argument though. Not in too deep so willing to wait it out and see what happens."

2021-05-02 07:11:15,wallstreetbets,"Obviously anecdotal, but I used to go a lot. At least once a month. The movie theaters opened back up in August, so about 9 months now and I've only been once. Part of that is simply because there really hasn't been good movies out but I don't see movie theaters ever recovering. I think with new releases being available at home 9 times out of 10 people will stay home. Not every time, sometimes you'll want a night out, but most times. 

I think if there was really any hope in recovery, we would at the very least have seen a spike of built up demand after reopening but it's been dead for 9 months..."

The expertise in hydrogen storage and distribution will certainly be valuable once airports and ports start requiring hydrogen terminals, but I believe that that will be at least 5 years out for ports and at least 15 for airports (since Airbus isn't planning on building a hydrogen-powered airplane beforehand).

2021-05-01 20:15:40,wallstreetbets,"That's true, but the chip shortage has slowed their market share growth. The fear with AMD is that this shortage will give Intel the appropriate headroom to mount an offensive without losing as much ground as they probably should have. Thats the reason for the short, by the time AMD is able to actually take advantage of their market position, Intel could have a real response ready to take Epyc and Ryzen in core count, price and performance. Not to mention Intel's relationship with OEMs and system integrators is still light years ahead of AMD. 

 Intel in 2017 expected AMD to improve 5 to 10% each generation...they weren't expecting AMD to be knocking on their door in 3 years with 15 to 20% gains per generation. They were caught flatfooted and realized they had to stop acting like a monopoly and take AMD seriously

It's going to be fucking awesome to be in the PC Gamer in 2 years, it just sucks eggs right now."
2021-05-02 01:33:56,wallstreetbets,"No problem. I wish I would have looked more into this before I learned the hard way.

Just to elaborate a bit. Higher IV (volatility) means a higher premium for options aka it will cost more, usually when a stock is mooning. Sometimes when you buy a call or put and the stock is starting to settle, the IV will drop which will decrease the value of your contracts even if they are in the money. So a high IV means you will need a much higher rise or fall to be profitable.

The inverse is true sometimes too. Options with low IV can sometimes be profitable if a stock moons suddenly, even if they arent in the money."

As governments are pushing regulations for desulphurisation, more hydrogen is required. Even if petrol cars go nowhere, hydrogen will pull a lot more revenue. On the off-chance that hydrogen fuel cells are closer than we think, their revenue will increase quite a bit. Even if they don't though, it won't affect APDs ability to grow their revenue numbers"

2021-05-02 11:17:32,wallstreetbets,"I try not to do my own independent research rather than use what they offer up, because it may not always print the full picture. Sales of their atmospheric gases constituted about 46% of sales, while hydrogen, syngas and related products constituted about 20%. They don't mention what the remaining 30% of gas sales are, but it could be gases like Helium and Xenon, which they produce. The research I used on the hydrogen generation market was this paper:
https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/hydrogen-generation-market

https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/industrial-gases-market

Another good paper on the industrial gases market, which focuses on atmospheric gases. Some points worth noting are the use of atmospheric gases in solar, compound semiconductors. These gases substantially reduce manufacturing costs. I think there's a big market for APD, and Linde as well, that's still essentially untapped, and far from reliant on hydrogen for transportation."

2021-05-01 23:58:00,wallstreetbets,"Mobileye (which services like 13 of the top manufacturers) owned by Intel has promised robo taxi's in 2022 as of their earnings call last week. Obviously geofenced, and in limited areas, but it seems promising considering Tesla originally used mobileye, and the alleged reason for the breakup was that Intel was not comfortable with how quick and careless Tesla was pushing FSD, and didnt want to associate mobileye with any deaths, which of course Tesla ended up killing some people with their own solution.

Also I am extremely skeptical that Tesla is able to keep its marketing promise of model 3 and other vehicles having level 5 capable hardware. I guarantee there will be a class action lawsuit over this when FSD officially launches (years, they will keep it in beta for as long as possible) and Tesla starts using more and better cameras in their vehicles.

Uber exited the space to nobodies surprise.

Waymo is in the same territory as Mobileye, but who are the actual customers? Again, Mobileye owns the majority of the autonomous car market, then you have a handful of companies like Tesla doing their own thing, so unless Google contracts out a manufacturer to make their Waymo cars, where is the tech going? Are they just using it to either collect data or sell the trained NN? AFAIK the only information ever given was back in 2019 when the CEO of Waymo said ""we made agreement with American Axle & Manufacturing Inc. to lease a factory in Detroit, where it will integrate its self-driving systems onto vehicles provided by *Fiat Chrysler* Automobiles and *Jaguar.*"" Basically retrofitting the shittiest cars on the market, that does not seem like a good business plan."
2021-05-02 09:16:28,wallstreetbets,"Great job man, appreciate it. You seem to know what you are talking about.

I have a feeling Tesla recognized they are not ahead of the competition anymore. Now they try went for the moonshot by removing Radar (ifrc: Musk said something like ""it is hard to combine both sensors. Especially if they send contradicting signals). Competitors seem already have figured out how to integrate multiple sensors. To fix that, Tesla took the shortcut and just removed Radar, so they don't have to bother with the integration of 2 sensors anymore and hope the can solve the vision only approach."
2021-05-02 13:56:48,wallstreetbets,Another Tesla bear and I don’t even know how to read. Lol.
2021-05-02 01:00:55,wallstreetbets,I noticed you said LiDAR doesnt hurt the eyes much... But it does hurt the eyes. When the parts degrade over time it will be shooting a high frequency laser into anyone near bys eyes. Burning through their retina. Especially when OEMs source cheap parts from China to keep costs down to compete with Tesla. Basically Big Auto will have to buy an extra LiDAR adding to costs while having a less efficient battery that also weighs more and cant go as far...
2021-05-02 05:55:19,wallstreetbets,"I think self driving is doomed. Even if the software was perfect, there will still be an inevitable crash from time to time. A bad luck streak of 3 self driving crashes in the same week will get all kinds of media attention and unite the whole world in anti-self-driving fervor, regardless of whatever statistics or data says about it being safer. Then the whole world will delight in beating the piss out of this supposed-smarty-pants-they-never-really-trusted-anyways-hes-a-billionaire-he's-not-one-of-us Elon Musk. RIP Tesla"
2021-05-02 11:51:03,wallstreetbets,"Thanks this is really helpful! Sorry for the ignorant question but one thing I don’t understand is the mapping issue. As you noted there’s a few different approaches to AI and the car “seeing” and making decisions, I don’t fully understand the tech but I kind of get it. What I don’t get as far as TRUE “self driving” or robotaxis is what these companies are doing to improve satellite positioning technology and road mapping. I never hear of big improvements on this. Is their positioning technology vastly superior to what we have in our phones or car systems for instance? Current phone and car GPS technology frequently doesn’t accurately place the user, or has the user mistakenly on the wrong / parallel road. What is the plan for dealing with closed roads, etc?"

2021-05-02 08:39:20,wallstreetbets,Might be true. But one day we will realize that self driving is simply safer than 95% of human driving in cars. Sometimes we are so fucking blind and tend to blow things out of proportions.
2021-05-02 11:56:13,wallstreetbets,I don’t think it’s doomed I just think the timeline is wildly different than proponents believe. 10 years? 20 years? 30? I think it’s quite possible. Tons of money will be burned before that.
2021-05-02 15:46:45,wallstreetbets,"HD map contains info that we do not have on Google map. This includes lane boundaries and road elevation, for example. It just increases the reliability of positioning and also useful for anomaly detection. Without HD map the car still works and can detect lanes, for example Waymo cars can follow police/construction instructions.

Completely without map the car can stay and drive on road, just doesn’t know how to get from A to B."
2021-05-02 13:53:07,wallstreetbets,"I don't know about Dojo. If it would be something groundbreaking, they already would have anounnced more specifics.

2021-05-02 15:55:13,wallstreetbets,"Ok makes sense. I mean I figured the mapping tech wasn’t the same as google maps but I just hear relatively little about that aspect vs perception / AI decision making aspects. I just googled though and see that Elon “criticized HD mapping.” So what’s TSLA’s solution to these issues?

And I get the car can technically “stay on the road” without a map but for true self driving it needs super capable mapping technology right?"

2021-05-02 16:00:50,wallstreetbets,Tesla uses semantic maps as far as I know. Maybe Tesla’s Dojo is their answer to auto labeling the road info without need a team to create map labels? I don’t know for sure.
2021-05-01 20:27:30,wallstreetbets,That’s their publicly available software. I thought their in-house only stuff was a bit further ahead but obviously not up to standard for wide scale use. I do think Waymo has the potential. Cruise is so specialised and the cars are ridiculous I don’t think they are consumer viable with their current strategy. Interesting times all the same!

2021-05-02 18:28:09,wallstreetbets,"I see your point but I don't think you can directly attribute the inflation to money printing in isolation as one of the biggest reasons for inflation right now is simply the by-product of an inefficient supply chain.

When the world fully opens up again, I expect competition to increase and supply to increase and any perceived inflation to go back to somewhat normal. You have to realize most money that's spent goes to corporations and corporations don't spend money at %'s even close to that of your every day consumer. Think about the massive cash reserves held by big companies."

There are about 120 million families in the US (Many who live in multi gen), and about 140 million homes.

In the US you can get investment property with a 20 year term, 30 year if it's residential."
2021-05-01 21:45:50,wallstreetbets,Avoid residential though
2021-05-02 01:45:41,wallstreetbets,"If I had to guess, I’d say the feds will eventually raise rates through the roof to curb hyperinflation. The housing market will crash hard. If interest rates are anything like the 70’s, loans will be highly undesirable but cash buyers will be able to scoop up great real estate deals."
2021-05-02 04:01:40,wallstreetbets,"I guess the case I'm talking about is that interest rates rise, property values tank cause all of a sudden people can't afford their big mortgages and are all trying to get out of it so they can downsize/rent. In that case you would be in high debt, negative equity and as soon as your fixed term ends you'd have to realise that negative equity or try to pay potentially that unaffordable interest.

That's what would happen if interest rates rise and you over leverage. Fixed term would only delay the inevitable.

So I see the gamble with inflation being, will they let inflation run? Or will they raise interest rates to curb it?

In the first case you want to over extend yourself in real estate debt, in the second you really wouldn't."
2021-05-02 06:51:45,wallstreetbets,"The first part of that though is that inflation rises.

Inflation has been tame for a very long time. If you expect that to change, a $100,000 debt today is going to feel like a much smaller amount after said bout of inflation.

This is assuming we see wage increases as well."

2021-05-02 15:58:45,wallstreetbets,"These sanctimonious boomers opining about “retail taking risks” and shit really irritate me. 

Like mother fucker we aren’t at the same level. If you’re in your 60s and not a complete retard you’ve probably got some wealth built up. It’s super fucking easy to build wealth slowly but surely by investing in good shit and compounding your gains.

Chad, the 22 year old burrito artist with 500 bucks in the market hoping to make enough to pay his student loans off isn’t gonna make life changing money with 500 in wmt shares. 

We’re all out here trying to claw our way out of poverty by striking it rich on growth stocks and options. There’s high risk/reward potential there, and we know it.

It’s so GODDAMN infuriating to listen to these bumble fucks smugly acting like they know better than us and we should just leave the investing to them.

Like bro if I had 3 milly I’d put it in safe boomer shit you think I want to be fucking with volatile ass shit?!  Fucking out of touch assholes man, I can’t wait till these fucks die off."

2021-05-01 21:41:27,wallstreetbets,Let’s say u can find a way to get a mortgage for a 20 million dollar mansion that u can not afford by any means. Do a interest only loan even. Enjoy it for 3 months and with this real estate market the price of the house may even go up 20-30% HELOC the house or just sell the house. Worst case you missed some payments and now your have to foreclose. But let’s say u manage to walk away +10% on a 20 million dollar house after fees. That’s 2 million dollars for vaccinating in a mansion.

Think I really screwed up by continuing to average down. Everyone discussing May sell, broader market heavily shorted, large volume on puts (broader market), etc... what is the concensus, odds it makes it back to mid 80's or higher in the next 2 weeks?

Super fucking weak all around in regard to their selection and interface. There are simply too many ways to stream shit for free to mess with this garbage.

When Cleveland-Cliffs bought AK Steel and AM USA or when the COVID recovery began, they had an easier window of opportunity to fix their failed thesis. Unfortunately, their addiction to negativity is apparently the only thing that they care about. These folks just don't want to see our industry thrive, and they clearly don't care about the well-paying middle-class jobs we generate and sustain in the United States.
For the record, from our proximate years, the median yearly pay of our 25,000 Cleveland-Cliffs employees is $102,000. And we are hiring because we're growing. Make no mistake, we are adding jobs. Since December 9, 2020, we have already added 710 new employees to our workforce.
As we always do at Cleveland-Cliffs, we are putting our money where our mouth is, and bringing back the America that we love, with a vibrant manufacturing sector, a thriving middle class, and with opportunities for all people that believe in education and hard work.

Rotation into oversold growth stocks begin to occur as big money looks beyond the indexes and finds bargain stocks down more than 70% off their ATH

We get an inverse of last month. Where indexes bleed and growth stocks go up

Even after the bleeding is done, the indexes don’t drop more than 10% because this market doesn’t crash"

The night before I went I stayed at a buddies house and his gf was in the shower that morning, so I didn't have time to wash up. I slept on his couch and it was hot as fuck all night, so I had some booty sweat going on. Tried to find some gold bond or something but I couldn't, so I went into his kitchen and found some flour. I figured it's similar right? So I put some flour in my ass and went to get a massage. When I got there this 50 year old Asian lady told me to strip naked, so I did, but I had a towel over my ass. No big deal. 

She does the regular massage, it's aight, then she ripped the towel off and basically mounted me and started working my ass cheeks. I'm like dude I know she sees there's flour in my ass. 

She flipped me at the end, gestured towards my PP and asked if I would tip. I'm pretty sure she was insinuating a happy ending, but I just said yes, tipped her,  and left."

You'd think that, but when you have that much cash to burn you can endlessly ramp up the crazy and ensure constant stimulation. Warren Buffet likely starts his morning with a donkey show at the foot of his bed and a bowl of froot loops. After that, he has the donkey beheaded while it is still inside the Cambodian slave girl he bought for a truckload of dry beans. He then snorts DMT out of the donkey's asshole and makes stock picks for the week while the slave girl scrubs his nutsack with stinging nettles."

2021-05-02 08:40:24,wallstreetbets," 

I am full of hope that someone can explain a question to me. I must have misunderstood, this is too good to be true, hence probably is not. As we all now, Twitter got a hit.

Now I see this kind of option:

[https://www.comdirect.de/inf/optionsscheine/DE000KA2Y5T2?ID\_NOTATION=264310118](https://www.comdirect.de/inf/optionsscheine/DE000KA2Y5T2?ID_NOTATION=264310118)

If i got this right, it means I am betting on Twitter to reach 48 or less until 17. June (breakeven price 47,18) and I need 10 puts for one full stock execution.

One option cost 0,067 euro, so it would mean 0,67 euro (plus fee) for the right to sell a twitter stock at 48. Which means the put will be then worth 4,8 (48/10)

Is that correct? Does that mean if I buy for 1000 monies and twitter stock price reaches 48 or less, I expect to make 10000?

Thank you very much for your patience."

2021-05-02 00:12:49,wallstreetbets,"Done. They have replied via email: 

Thank you for following up.

We will only sell you out of a position if you leave an account deficit uncovered.
 
 Several things can cause you to have an account deficit including:
Transfer reversals
Fees 
Early assignment on options spreads
Your portfolio value falling below margin maintenance requirements
Having an account deficit does not necessarily mean that you are in a margin call, but you may not be able to open new positions until the deficit is covered. 
 
You can resolve an account deficit by depositing funds or closing positions.

So.....since I pay cash for all of my positions, nothing on margin, I’m good. They ain’t selling my shares. Whew!"
2021-05-02 15:41:20,wallstreetbets,Nice!  Good to know.  I like to avoid buying on margin anyway

2021-05-02 01:35:16,wallstreetbets,"Glad to hear it! If you apply for any account changes, such as being able to trade options, just keep an eye out to make sure margin doesn't get enabled. It would show on your holding screen. When I applied for options trading on one of my accounts they enabled it, a quick call later and it was disabled."
2021-05-02 07:25:31,wallstreetbets,It doesn't matter. Fidelity won't screw you over.

I will do my own research and post my thoughts on that as well, I just can’t right now.

FSM should outperform with this acquisition and mine upgrades"

One of the cheaper ways i have found is to purchase Kinesis silver crypt and you can take redemption of a much smaller quantity, and it's a lot closer to spot than going through a metal dealer."
2021-05-02 16:04:54,wallstreetbets,"Yup. Timing is uncertain, but final result is a certainty

There is just not enough silver around

Industrials NEEDS 500 + million ounce a year to produce their shit.

That number is just going to go through the roof with green revolution bullshit and electric vehicles (Tesla anyone?)

2021-05-02 00:22:11,wallstreetbets,"My trade plan is (based entirely on options intrinsic value only):

SLV $30 - What I consider the neutral case. This is my breakeven, and if October rolls around and SLV is over 30 but hasn't moved beyond that I'd likely bail late August

SLV $50 - Bull case. At this point I'd try to pull out roughly half my money, first from calls with delta close to 1, then from up to half the PSLV. My hope is that it goes past this, but I learned my lessons from holding through the first GME peak without selling anything at all and don't plan to repeat that.

SLV $80 and up - Extreme bull case. Pull out at least another 25% of the investment. Become fuck-you rich

SLV $100 - I'd probably pull out completely at this point. Don't actually expect this to happen but a man can dream."
2021-05-02 15:14:38,wallstreetbets,I think any moves will develop over the next 2-3 months. Obviously I'd love if it jumped tomorrow but I'd be pretty surprised.

2021-05-01 23:37:58,wallstreetbets,"Beside being monetary a metal, silver is critical to industrial user."
2021-05-01 23:38:09,wallstreetbets,"The Indispensable Metal

Silver has many industrial uses, accounting for more than half of annual demand worldwide over the last five years.
Industrial applications use silver's conductivity (the highest of any element for electricity and heat) as well as its sensitivity to light and anti-bacterial qualities.


Today silver is invaluable to solder and brazing alloys, batteries, dentistry, glass coatings, LED chips, medicine, nuclear reactors, photography, photovoltaic (or solar) energy, RFID chips (for tracking parcels or shipments worldwide), semiconductors, touch screens, water purification, wood preservatives and many other industrial uses. Washington-based industry group the Silver Institute calls it ""the indispensable metal"".

The biggest consumers of silver for industrial applications this past decade have been the major economies and over that time silver demand from older industries has faded, only to be replaced by new technological uses."

Current Comex silver registered for deliery is 117m oz - 5200 May contracts = 90m oz left.

Open interest for July is 134K with expected min 10% delivery.  1 contract is 5000oz

No way this is going to be 25$ by Christmas as price have to raise to attract sellers (wait for 3 digits)"
2021-05-02 16:53:11,wallstreetbets,"Miners are ok but wont do anything for squeeze.

Only buying physical bullion or PSLV which is 100% backed ETF and remove physical from the market + SLV calls (not shares!)"

2021-05-02 18:15:24,wallstreetbets,"SLV doesn't use ETF's to short, it is an ETF. They take the inflows to either acquire or lease physical silver and then short by issuing Comex contracts approx. 200 times the amount of inflows."

In June 2014 I was by a conference and one of the sessions involved a discussion of online bookkeeping software and Xero came up (back then QB online was really horrendous... QB only took action to improve their online software because of the threat posed to them by Xero) and it was apparent to me that Xero would develop a growing userbase.

A few days later in mine and my wife's IRA's I bought 100 shares each of Xero for $23.37 a share. Now it is up to $107.25 a share (so about $16,700 gain on a $4,600 investment). Wish I had bought more of that and less of dumb oil well stocks back then (oil wells did good for a few years before oil prices plummeted and many went out of business)."
2021-05-02 14:46:48,wallstreetbets,"Yeaaa I had bought in a bit later around 60 a share. The only shitty part about it was it was only on the OTC market. So in Canada I couldn't buy it from my tax free savings account.

2021-05-02 19:27:28,wallstreetbets,I sold the 20p for $10.40 premium (making the break even $9.60). I wouldn’t mind owning under $10 since that was the offering price. But I don’t see it going below $10 because of the offering.
2021-05-02 02:29:06,wallstreetbets,So OP and you don't know either. You just shorted yourself
2021-05-02 10:09:08,wallstreetbets,"The one problem when doing DD was the fact that:

1. They don't have rights to the vaccine, merely licensing to sell it in the U.S.
2. The US Vaccine rollout will be done in July 2021

2021-05-01 22:50:46,wallstreetbets,I've had AMD shares sense $30. Planning to switch them to leaps soon and dump a lot more in... It can only be suppressed by merger arbitrage trading and other shorts for so long

2021-05-02 06:13:57,wallstreetbets,"That's why their predictions are always accurate, so boosting them to 50% means a lot (extra tsmc capacity)."
2021-05-01 20:15:18,wallstreetbets,"Absolute revenue alone  is an arbitrary value for comparing profitability of stocks.

For it to be meaningful, the companies being compared would need an identical number of shares/operating expenses/margins/growth.

Just because a company is much bigger than a smaller competitor, doesn't mean the bigger company's stock is going to be more profitable.

For example, 35% YoY growth is much easier for AMD to achieve, than a company like Intel, simply because it requires much fewer customers for AMD to accomplish this.

A smaller company has far more room for growth, than a company already at the top does."
2021-05-02 03:24:40,wallstreetbets,Its because a ton of future growth is already priced in.
2021-05-01 21:24:27,wallstreetbets,"I understand that, it has the lowest earning per share too. I’m long AMD and planning on diving in I’m just not sure how these graphs show that it’s time to rise. Is it just off the low P/E, low debt, and increasing short interest? 

I like AMD bc they’re smaller as you mentioned, growing and eating into intel market share yet their price has stayed flat for half a year. And the chip shortage is more about chip demand, so semis will be hot for years to come bc demand for tech will increase."
2021-05-02 16:09:39,wallstreetbets,Ah so its people from 5 years ago cucking over current investors
2021-05-02 18:00:53,wallstreetbets,"...and not selling out all his AMD for *at least* another 3 years minimum, but probably longer; plenty more growth ahead.

The vast majority of people will make a lot more money by doing their DD and playing a long game, vs trying to be Limitless Bradley Cooper after a few hours of mindless smartphone scrolling and robinhood.

Even if these guys bought AMD at its all time high, they'd still make a nice profit cashing out if they opted to ride it out until it climbs higher in the next 12+ months.

Feel free to prove me wrong."

2021-05-02 00:58:11,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that's not a gamble I'm willing to take in this market. At an average of 25, if I even collect like 50-100 bucks on my 650 shares, if by chance it spikes up over my strike price, I'm fucked. Haha

This market is a bit irrational for CCs right now, especially when my avg price is so high.

I could sell CCs for oct 2021 or jan 2022 and collect a decent premium, and in which case it would be at a higher or break even point of my shares, but that's a huge gamble too. Just a bit safer I guess"
2021-05-02 00:56:00,wallstreetbets,"I am thinking of selling some CCs on it for may as well. What sort of premium did you get for 21/21 strike for may 16?

It just sucks that I had the chance to sell at 29-31ish range but instead just held and now it's back down to around my avg price. So I really need to sell CCs and collect some premium while lowering that average in hopes that it spikes just enough to get to that range but not too crazy high. 

I am dumb though I should have sold CCs when it was around 28+ for around 35 strike since I was planning to hold anyway! Ugh"

2021-05-02 17:02:47,wallstreetbets,"Tip for you (mods) since /u/ryldyl posts keep getting nixed.

This dude is a legitimately (consistently so) decent trader who isn't obnoxious trying to push some BS agenda, but rationalizes his trades for better or worse, and tries to post them onto the sub. I know automod is the culprit, but can't y'all suggest to zjz to add some sort of filter for people who genuinely add value to the sub? I fear people like him will get frustrated and not bother posting anymore. 

I'd hate to see WSB become just an after-the-fact collection of wins and losses. IMO the value of this sub has been/is looking at the bets as they're placed, seeing the outcome with our own eyes, and then coming back to see the loss/gain pr0n as a result. I hope this is (still) the case, but as the saying goes, all good things must (at some point) come to an end..."
2021-05-02 17:32:38,wallstreetbets,"So his post wasn't removed, this is live. I checked his history and I see very few removed posts. The removed ones are not from automod removal rather they failed another qualification - mostly content violations. 

His issue is actually the title and it's affecting upvotes and excitement for the trade. That's why I made the suggestion I did. If he adds detail in the comments about the trade and makes the title super clear he'll get a better result. 

As a member of the community, you can help with this. When you see good plays that lack detail ask the OP about it in the comments. This will help the sub."
2021-05-02 17:38:18,wallstreetbets,"awesome. thanks for the tips!

i should add that i don’t envy the job of you mods at the moment (tho it seems that absolute craziness is receding), and am overly appreciative of the time y’all put into it. i always remind myself that for every “wrong” i seem to witness, there must be thousands of “rights” that we users never get to see due to everything happening behind scenes.

so, from one retarded internet stranger:

#THANK YOU"
2021-05-02 18:01:52,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for caring about the sub. The automod and visual mod are like guardrails - they block the worst of it out, mods add that next layer of cleaning things up, but after that it’s us leaning on you guys.

Report things that are sus, report spam etc, and hold people accountable to the WSB culture. If something is shit, tell them frankly and respectfully. If it’s good ask them about it. 

Good to keep in mind too sometimes it feels like if you report spam or bad content that it doesn’t get taken care of but it will - just can be delayed till we catch up. 

You can also tag me directly If you spot something that needs a mod asap. I’m a low level janitor so I’m easier to reach. 😉"
2021-05-01 23:37:51,wallstreetbets,My personal favorite is his post on how to eat ornamental gourds
2021-05-02 00:57:25,wallstreetbets,"Nah. Lower rates = more buyers. Higher rates = less buyers. It's a free for all right now. Houses are selling faster than inventory can keep up. I guess that could be a potential headwind, along with lumber going through the roof. However, low rates will keep that gravy train moving. If rates go up with construction materials still skyrocketing, that's going to probably suck the life out of the housing boom. So...low rates = 🍌🍌🍌"

2021-05-02 13:05:56,wallstreetbets,"Here’s what I believe.  There is no such thing as an apple car.  There will be new apple car technology that Fisker cars will be first to launch, but not have exclusivity to. 

That tablet in every Tesla will be an iPad in every Fisker.   They will sync with your iPhone and have hardware compatibility with iPhones like no other car. 


Apple won’t be making a car from the ground up,  that makes no sense.  but they will make car technology that  integrates your phone with your car.  Think CarPlay times a million. 

Fisker has a pending deal with Foxconn which to me is the green flag that the deal is def happening.  Fisker makes the cars with magna and Foxconn, apple makes the tech that makes the cars work with your phones in a really exciting way.   Apple and Foxconn have hardware validation that works.  

It’s surprising there are so many bears with FSR.  Once I heard a partnership with foxconn was in the works I bought 1000 shares at 19 cost basis. 

Good luck to Fisker bulls."
2021-05-02 14:29:18,wallstreetbets,"I like this. A few of the articles I've read recently have, somewhat vaguley, stated things that sound a lot like Apple has similar sentiments.

Though, I've also heard more recently Apple and Foxconn will not be partnering and possibly instead going to partner with Magna, but that also seems like pure speculation"

2021-05-02 01:16:52,wallstreetbets,"Get back to me in 2-3 months. Anyone can ""grow 17 types"" doesn't really mean shit. It matters what they pull down, how often, contamination rate, and how much they sell it for. Growing boomers consistently and efficiently ain't easy. How big is their room? How many units will they pull? If they don't have a way to pasteurize/sterilize bulk substrate it's not even worth talking about. A couple tubs with shelves won't get a frat high on movie night."
2021-05-02 02:16:50,wallstreetbets,You couldn't be more wrong. Herb genetics are insane right now. People are growing crack and pulling a unit per light plus in fucking dirt. Next time you want to chime in just hit the dab and go back to listening to some bullshit.
