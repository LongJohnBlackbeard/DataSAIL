2021-07-02 18:55:02,wallstreetbets,Can you help me understand why it would go higher on an event we are already assuming will happen?  Are you thinking it‚Äôs more likely to NOT happen?  I‚Äôve heard this perspective a bunch today and I just don‚Äôt understand the logic
2021-07-02 19:07:32,wallstreetbets,"There is a lot of risk launching. If they get it to work perfectly, the shares should go up. If they blow up, well that's the end of the company. Big risk, big rewards.

I'm hoping it will go above 60. I hope."
2021-07-02 19:05:07,wallstreetbets,"It could tip up for a morning stint or whatever, at this point I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely to go past the ATH even if it does shoot up on that Branson flight, I feel like it‚Äôs already been priced into the share price, and today‚Äôs up/down makes me think that even more so.  There is a very low chance it will stay up when the hype wears off.  I think it‚Äôs likely to head back to 30$ before it starts to really look like a company and not a hype wagon.  But I could be wrong, just my opinion :) Good luck!"
2021-07-02 19:11:27,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough.  If you‚Äôve already made good money, I would be looking to exit.  Either A) the launch goes off smooth (what‚Äôs already priced in) so it pulls back or B) it blows up and pulls back.  The top is in IMO."
2021-07-02 19:12:31,wallstreetbets,I agree with you üíØ- the top was in yesterday
2021-07-02 19:21:48,wallstreetbets,I won't be holding any shares afterwards regardless. The company isn't ready yet.

Those comments not being deleted out of nowhere. Some of the comments on this thread fell afoul of the spam filter (that's nothing new at all). Some of them have been rescued because they do add value despite triggering filters, some of them haven't because they add no value to the conversation whatsoever. Notice your post isn't down? I can't guarantee nobody else will take it down, but I can personally guarantee that it's been seen by a few mods and left up.

2021-07-02 19:32:53,wallstreetbets,"they problem is that they are facing actual business headwinds. 

1. demand for houses is up but supply is severely limited

2. competition between each other is driving a price war to the bottom and affecting profitability. (Class action lawsuit actually just started against RKT for overstating its profitability projections)

3. Interest rate risk from fed may be getting priced in.

If anything is sure though - people will always want houses. Just gotta wait and see how it plays out."

2021-07-02 17:42:14,wallstreetbets,Just hold. I held 700 shares even when it plunged to 14$ pre merger when I had an average cost of 18$ and change. Sold at 22-23$ but I rebuy every time it hits 17$
2021-07-02 18:34:24,wallstreetbets,i wouldn't worry about it.  it will be back to the mid $20's once the lockup expiration fear subsides.

All I need to know, these potato chip people are smart with their money management. I'm in."
2021-07-02 16:40:50,wallstreetbets,"/u/Hotpicks21 Eagletree Capital which owns more than 50% of the capital unloads shares every time it goes above 35. You can see the filings. The last time the stock spiked, they sold 8% of the entire share count (or their share count, i can't quite recall).

2021-07-02 17:11:29,wallstreetbets,One more sale like that and they lose majority control. There‚Äôs no certainty they want to lose that yet.
2021-07-02 18:23:45,wallstreetbets,good day trading at least
2021-07-02 19:22:49,wallstreetbets,Past couple months you coulda played it like a fiddle. Buy leaps and sell short dated calls when it jumps. I'm expecting it to breakout soon because this strategy works until it doesn't.
2021-07-02 16:37:03,wallstreetbets,They beat earnings by 1.5x last quarter and it didn‚Äôt move.
2021-07-02 17:17:09,wallstreetbets,"That's not the modus operandi of companies like EagleTree Capital. They take companies private or buy private companies. Saddle them with debt (sometimes/usually significant), but otherwise fix them up, and then put them back on the market by IPO'ing them a few years later. They don't need majority control, their return on investment . Remember, they are a private equity fund. 

They bought a majority stake for 525M. Their ROI is bonkers. [https://www.tweaktown.com/news/58574/corsair-majority-stake-bought-525-million/index.html](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/58574/corsair-majority-stake-bought-525-million/index.html)"
2021-07-02 16:43:28,wallstreetbets,They beat earnings on a tech correction back in april. Overall market was down at the time.
2021-07-02 17:20:09,wallstreetbets,"I mean I basically agree, but Michael potter and eagletree both have said they feel it should be worth more. Can‚Äôt assume all their sells will be at the $35 point can we? 

It‚Äôs annoying to me the important people are putting on eagletree. The effect of their selling is only the way it is because of low volume. Great opportunity for retail to buy up shares institutions can‚Äôt so easily get without driving the price up"
2021-07-02 17:26:47,wallstreetbets,"Words are one thing, and actions are another. And their actions don't meet their words.

Does this inspire confidence in you?

Don't get me wrong, i have 200 shares, and I'm not negative on them (though only very slightly positive). But i've been selling covered calls and made almost 1$ off selling covered calls for last month and July at way out of the way prices for a reason. 37.5$ to be exact. Because i know they won't get called away, and if they do i'm okay with it.

The stock will continue to trade side ways until the market is assured that they're going to stop dumping the bag on them, or they are done dumping said bags. Not before.

Edit: Scroll down, and you can see where they are selling at here: [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/crsr/company-profile?mod=mw\_quote\_tab](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/crsr/company-profile?mod=mw_quote_tab)"
2021-07-02 17:31:07,wallstreetbets,"They are still holding millions of shares. The executive insider selling doesn‚Äôt concern me, the lack of clarity on eagletrees part does. Executives have the right to realize some profit after IPO in my mind. The lack of clarity around eagle tree, and the inability of other institutions to buy in in any reasonable quantity without skyrocketing the price is what I see limiting it right now. Months of range bound trading is still a fantastic opportunity for retail without much capital to buy in."
2021-07-02 17:36:07,wallstreetbets,"EagleTree has made over 600-700% in realized profits in the span of just four years considering they acquired Corsair on June of 2017. The exact percentage could be more, considering when they unloaded their shares.

They are going to keep unloading because their a private equity venture, and they want to make their next play. Their not like Bill Foley and Cannae, where their a hybrid.

My guess is that they'll lower their stake to roughly 20%, but that we won't see measurable appreciation until then or if we do it'll be a slow and steady."
2021-07-02 17:39:40,wallstreetbets,Also /u/NoTransportation2899 I'm not hating on the stock. I just told you you're better off rolling your calls later out because of what I said.
2021-07-02 17:39:48,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt see how it can stay range bound down to them owning only 20% of the float. With every sale the effect of their sale lessens as free float increases. I think people worry about them too much. More than 2x the entire number of shares they own were traded in the span of a few days two weeks ago‚Ä¶ 

Holiday season and DDR5 aren‚Äôt far away. They will likely exceed expectations again this quarter. I don‚Äôt see the $35 price point being a sticking point much longer.

They are all on a plan (forget the name) with agreed upon sell dates and prices."
2021-07-02 17:41:12,wallstreetbets,"Oh, I‚Äôm shares on this one with the exception of some august $32.5 calls as an earnings play. Happy to wait, and your thought process is pretty logical here. I just think if volume and interest pick up, their shares can be churned through rather quickly."

2021-07-02 16:25:33,wallstreetbets,How do you decide what to buy options on?  That‚Äôs a pretty big position for an options play. Do you think NVDA will sell off after the split?  Similar to TSLA and AAPL?

2021-07-02 16:16:15,wallstreetbets,"Probably around the 23rd, but if you're asking for a dollar amount, if it hit say 900 really early though, I'd certainly sell at that and open a LEAP position. Not with all of it mind you, if it ramped up that much pre split I'd expect it to crash a bit post split. Then open the position a bit larger if it does crash, or if it doesn't for that matter, and put a bunch into a play I'm considering with another company."

2021-07-02 17:02:12,wallstreetbets,Why would they? Is AMD diversifying their business in any way that would cause them to be handled in a brighter light than other chip makers?
2021-07-02 16:43:47,wallstreetbets,"Likely, but I also expect it to recover afterwards. I will not be holding through the turmoil of that nonsense unless something indicates to me I should. I'll grab leaps as it unfolds. I expect them to perform well in the long term. To answer your question about how I pick stocks for option plays, if we're talking about mid term plays and not FDs, its really just me sitting down and having the discussion with myself: I'd buy this stock, but I don't want to limit my gains so how much am I willing to leverage myself. As for what makes me want a stock to begin with though, it depends on the security itself. I'm not a value trader or anything, I really just look at companies and their products and try to think about whether I think the demand will grow or continue, obviously fundamentals are important but I'm  not the guy that's going to be digging through 10-Ks. I just look into what the company has been putting out, how their earnings have been, whether I think they'll be an innovator, etc."

2021-07-02 19:28:45,wallstreetbets,"Not so much diversifying as just straight up killing it. Operating income rose 189% from 2019 to 2020 with eps up 604%. Q1 2021 operating income is up 266% and eps is up 232% from Q1 2020 and it isn't *just* higher margins; Total revenue in 2020 was up 45% from 2019 and Q1 2021 total rev Is up 92% compared to Q1 2020. Oh and the XLNX acquisition or whatever pending china approval.

  
AND there are some tasty insider whispers IF TRUE insinuating next gen GPU performance above and beyond what they expect from Nvidia. FULL STOP. Not at bargain price points, or for certain niche applications just straight up expecting to have the best GPUs on the market next gen. Nvidia having something spicy up their sleeve non-withstanding; you never know with Nvidia.   

  Add in plans to buy back 4 billion worth of shares over the next 4(?) Years with cash on hand and plans for 3nm production by 2024 and everything I hear about AMD makes me think up up up. They have new deals with Samsung for their phones and google/amazon for servers, to add to the pile of deals like making chips for Sony and Microsoft consoles. The future looks bright.

I put 90% of my account in AMD last month when they were hovering around 80$ without a single worry and I haven't unwound my position yet. Hoping for 2021 guidance to be adjusted from 50% to 75% growth to set this thing off again. Or merger approval, whatever comes first."
2021-07-02 17:55:49,wallstreetbets,Let's see if their Xilinx acquisition is approved
2021-07-02 17:20:04,wallstreetbets,They're gaining market share pretty quickly and just released their new threadripper for HEDT/server applications that outperforms intel's best chips for lower cost.
2021-07-02 17:54:07,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but with a July 30 expiration, surely something made you think that this month something good was going to happen. What was your thought process there"
2021-07-02 18:47:25,wallstreetbets,I must be high on retardation then
2021-07-02 19:30:15,wallstreetbets,"Now that, does interest me. I suppose it's time to look into a position."
2021-07-02 17:46:17,wallstreetbets,"Threadripper part sounds interesting, if that portion of their business is a big enough percentage, or as a result of this change becomes a large enough percentage, then sure, why not? But AMD just doesn't have the zing factor that makes me want to buy quite yet. But I'm just a guy, what do I know, not much."
2021-07-02 18:00:23,wallstreetbets,"Split was going to drive retail interest up, ongoing shortage, earnings report within a month of the split, continued innovation and diversification almost guaranteed some sort of nice announcement. Did I know they were going to acquire ARM? Nope, but I assumed a nice announcement was going to happen involving what they've done with all of the money they've made through the shortage, and that was exactly what I was looking for. They don't sit idly, if they're going to be handed assloads of money I expect them to reinvest, and they have."
2021-07-02 18:51:06,wallstreetbets,"This guy has 86 nvidia contracts he‚Äôs literally rich and yet retarded enough to use Robinhood. He probably owns shares too, and many other stocks."
2021-07-02 18:02:51,wallstreetbets,I was riding some AMD from feb to april with no gains and sold it off to buy nvidia and AMC. I understand the hesitation.   Intel is the only other game in town for x86 compute and they still have deeper pockets and a bigger R&D budget than AMD but on the other hand AMD can stay in second place but double their sales by going from 15% market share to 30% market share. They have already won over the hearts and minds of the enthusiast/gamer market with their last two generations of chips and if intel can't get it together and match the performance of AMD's new server chips the big boys that buy millions of dollars of chips at a time for server center deployment are going to follow the gamers out there and leave intel in the dust. I know product performance isn't necessarily the same as company performance but it kind of seems to me like the time is right for AMD to start moving.
2021-07-02 19:28:24,wallstreetbets,"I started this year with 20k in my account from making small deposits over 2 years, I've grown it to where I am now. I'm not rich, but I hope to be."

This person knew my password, had access to my phone and my finger prints. The sick bastard even knew my mother‚Äôs maiden name. I know I couldn‚Äôt believe it either. He needs to be stopped.

SPY is now trading at $433.72 and each of those contracts is worth $57 now from almost $513. Rent is coming up so I‚Äôm going to need my money back.

Are you upset that the dog was given your sleeping spot at the foot of the bed and now you have to sleep on the floor?

Do you wanna prove your independence to your wife and her boyfriend? 

Do you refer to your phone/Robinhood app as ‚Äúthe money-maker‚Äù?

Is your throat overdone from that double shift at the Wendy‚Äôs dumpster?

If you answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù to any of those questions, the engineers here at Barney M.D. have a solution for you.

[Introducing WSB.gold for Tesla](https://imgur.com/sTgJ64Q)

With WSB.gold for Tesla, you no longer have to worry whether or not Chad will let you have your 15 minutes of computer time for the day because, *there is a computer in the car*, so you can get that sweet sweet WSB sentiment fix while you FOMO at the peak.

For only 69 easy payments of $420.69, you too can gain the hope of actually making tendies one day.

But wait, there‚Äôs more!

‚ÄúBut Barney M.D., most of my money goes to FDs or whatever Chad wants, how am I going to afford WSB.gold for Tesla?‚Äù

Just remember, these 69 easy payments can be paid for by all of the money that you make from *using* WSB.gold.^^1

Remember - I keep posting this a lot cuz in the end people are gambling real money, many times money they need and honestly it gets depressing reading thinking about someone who put $2000 in AMC @62 holding for weeks instead of selling and making money elsewhere.

2021-07-02 17:27:56,wallstreetbets,"The lockup has people worried, but there is good reason to believe big long positions are trying to drive price down before July 6th. There is a clause in the agreement that states 33% of their position would be lost if price hits above 12.50 upon lock up expiration as well as 66% if price exceeds 15$ (please correct me if I'm wrong but I recall it being somewhere along those lines) Since the float is 140% institutional ownership, then there currently at a market price of 11.4 is 1.8 billion dollars in institutional shares, if the price passes 15$ they would lose 1.2 billion in their long positions. It is very likely that these huge long positions could also be the huge short positions and they are dragging it out until they get the full amount of shares on lockup expiry. Not only are they making a huge amount on their shorts since the largest position was took on the day clov exploded, but the will make the full amount on their shares on lock up. And just the icing on the cake is that banks will also be trying to drive down price to keep the large amount of options out of the money and expire worthless."

2021-07-02 16:47:51,wallstreetbets,"Many institutions have been calling out the possibility of a short squeeze. The SI and CTB are insanely high and all it will take is for one of the big dogs to push in some chips and then its a race to cover the shorts. Last squeeze only required a 5% volume uptick to push off. Also, there is high speculation that the public float is actually smaller than posted, which means that the SI is higher, and if that is the case and it is confirmed then boom üí•"
2021-07-02 17:04:38,wallstreetbets,Yes strong volume with +100M buy days pushing up.  Currently shorts are just walking the price down to what ever they want.

2021-07-02 17:03:14,wallstreetbets,"This is true. But with the increase of SI over the past 2 days I think we see it soon, now that the prices are a little more juicy to buy. Could entirely fizzle out, but CLOV isn't exactly a bad long play either."

I believe they legitimately had 100k pre-orders, even if some of them were unlikely to convert to purchases, and I believe that there will be demand for the truck when it becomes available for purchase.  

I might be wrong.  I thought we'd start hearing good news by now, and I lost about half of everything I had to lose because I was wrong. But I believe in this company and the product they're making."

2021-07-02 17:21:17,wallstreetbets,Except that this is a team sport. What do you think a hedge fund is? Its a team of people pooling their money together. What is a fund manager at Fidelity do? Pool money together from a large group of people. Like...a team. Either way short sellers have gone beyond picking off fundamentally weak companies. Now they specifically target WSB if you listen to them talk about it on podcasts and fintwit. They can hold for a borrow but at some point they do have to cover. Also the only circumstance required for a squeeze is a lack of sellers. A stock could squeeze on 1% short. VW was like 10% short but porsche held like 80%. Either way thanks for having mercy on all us newbs and not shorting our crazy memes. Itd suck to have to buy that 1 lot of a 10 dollar stock.

2021-07-02 16:30:45,wallstreetbets,"In what sense? Fundamentals? I've explained that enough, but i can rehash the basic points if you want. 

However, if you're talking about why it squeezed. It's simple. 

1) The short interest fee was high for a significant period of time. It's still elevated. This is just for IBKR, but you can see it here: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/UWMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/UWMC) 

2) The company is making a significant amount of money (note: profit). Note how it was that way for both VW and UWMC. That means they had no reason to dilute themselves.

3) UWMC had a dividend, and a high one of 40 cents a year at that. Note that this means that the potential payoff was limited due to it, and that if they wanted to keep their sales sold short on the ex dividend payout date they were on the hook for the payment.

4) UWMC initiated a buyback authorization of roughly 45% of the float at the time of the earnings, when the SP was ridiculously low at roughly 6.23. The man said on the earnings call at the day after that hew was a buyer, and they'd start the next day.

5) THE SP was brought ridiculously low, into the low 6's. Which was roughly 4 times forward earnings 2022, or less. Note that the yield got higher, so shorts who piled on (and they did) had to contend with a higher yield."
2021-07-02 15:54:38,wallstreetbets,"I get what you mean. I guess the problem with it is that people can use it to justify their position in a shit stock.

2021-07-02 19:12:45,wallstreetbets,"I'm going to preface what i say with a caveat that I haven't read their financial statements. With that said, i know there was some truth to the Hindenburg Research Report on them. I also don't like their CEO's past, since he ran the previous company he headed into the ground. It's why I didn't invest.

Looking at the analyst predictions on Marketwatch, I see they expect negative earnings and a hefty one of -18 cents in 2023. Which means it could be 2025-2026 before they turn a profit (if they turn one).

I also know CLOV is under investigation.

Truthfully, there is the possibility that if prices remain elevated for awhile they do a ATM offering and get money at the expense of shareholder dilution. 

Short interest is pretty high at over 30%, but I don't know what their entry point was, and if they entered the stock when it was pumped you're SOL. If they didn't, the share price has tanked since it was pumped, and their likely on their way back to even."
2021-07-02 17:21:29,wallstreetbets,"Nobody is going to buy Lordstown vehicles. Customers buy vehicles from companies that will be around in the future for ongoing service and maintenance. 

Think SAAB circa 2010. They practically had to give the cars away... and that included ongoing service from GM. Everybody knows Lordstown ain't gonna make it, especially because they're focused on the commercial electric market, and Ford just released a better, more focused, higher quality, and more affordable product. 

Lordstown is completely dead. I don't understand why anybody thinks otherwise."
2021-07-02 17:08:18,wallstreetbets,"They've stated they need money for production in September, but their under investigation which essentially kneecaps their ability to do so. Insiders sold a massive amount of stock before earnings, which is documented. As for the other shares, i believe their under a lock-up period. 

DOJ investigation was reported today by the WSJ. I, honestly, think you should pull your money out. You're on your way to losing pretty much all of it if the trajectory of this company continues the way it has been. The Board, and the Executive Team, have continuously lied to the shareholders and I'm just flabbergasted that their share price has only just gone under their NAV for the SPAC.

Your money would better be spent elsewhere than on a company that is, on the merits, likely headed for insolvency. 

With that said, it's your money, and you're entitled to doing what you wish with it. With the caveat that you're not spending your lifesavings when there are people who are dependent on you."
2021-07-02 18:30:59,wallstreetbets,"UWMC squeezed from 6.23 to the mid 10's. I think for a very brief period it was at the high ten period. Yes. That was a squeeze lmao. That was a 68.5% return if you sold at 10.5 exactly. 

Get a below 8 average and it becomes an excellent income play during good and bad times. At the low 7's and in the 6's it's just stupid not to buy. Over 5% dividend, combined with selling covered calls and you get an absolute minimum of an over 10% return in good times and bad provided you only get 5 dollars per contract in premium (and you can get higher than that). 

Add to that, the fact they can raise the dividend, and it's a no brainer. 

Valuation matters, and return on investment matters. By those statistics, it's undervalued. Their MSR revenues alone are ridiculously high, and going up significantly. They are saying they will do 200B in loan volume (GOS margin line item for revenue) in 2024. This is a company that could, conceivably, do over 2B in net income a year by 2024. 

If they do 200B a year in loan volume, that's 3B in revenue provided that the GOS Margin is 1.5%. Their direct loan production cost Q1 was a whoppingly low 13.1M. Multiply that by 4, and you get 52,4M. Last year they did over 181B in loan production. So let's be generous and say the loan production cost FY 2024 is 60M. That leaves 2.94B in revenue. Then reduce salaries and commissions as well as general administrative for Q1 2021 and that's roughly 230M. Multiply that by 4, and you get 920M in costs for both. Add the 60M for loan production costs, and it is 980M. Tack on another 20M since Ishbia say's he's hiring and we'll call it an even 1B in costs.  That leaves 2B in revenues. 

Their loan servicing revenue is 123.8M in the latest quarter alone. Have you see how much volume their doing, or the fact that they've been price matching their competition? It's clear that he's trying to get as many MSR's as he can, while simultaneously destroying the competition's ability to field volume in the coming years due to downsizing as well as doing damage to their pocketbook. You take that revenue line, and then remove the expense line for servicing costs, and that removes 20.5M. That leaves a quarterly income of 103.3M per quarter. Or 410.2M. However. The MSR line is rapidly expanding, and i expect it to be over 250M per quarter soon enough. By 2024, it could be as high as 2-3B in FY revenue for 2024. The bottom line number would mean the MSR line would need to increase roughly four fold. But considering my expectation is that quarterly MSR income will reach over 250M a quarter by Q4 2021, I don't expect that goal to be missed. We'll say 2B a year in MSR revenue to be safe, and since the cost to service those loans stands at roughly 16.55% of revenue, 2B\*.165, the expense line for mortgage servicing rights would be 330M. 2B-330M=1.67B 

The only thing left after that is interest expense which is fixed at a bit less than 53M and marketing travel and entertainment. I don't expect the cost to exceed 150M. I BELIEVE (Too lazy to check right now) that the interest income is paid semi annually. 

So, in summation of what net income is roughly projected to be. Once you substract the expenses from the revenues, you'll get roughly 3.52B in net income. As Mortgage servicing rights get more valuable as interest rates rise (lower prepayments), the book value of the company will rise or they can sell the mortgage servicing rights. If Matt Ishbia and his brother converted all their shares to Class A shares from their Class D shares (Economic interest as opposed to voting rights), that would be 1.6B shares receiving a dividend of 40 cents a year. Let's also say there are no buybacks (an impossibility considering they have been buying back shares), and that equates to 640M a year in dividends. Which is a payout ratio of .1818, or in other words, ultra safe. 

So, when i hear ""Baghold"" and this stock, i legitimately cringe. You're not bag holding. You're investing."
2021-07-02 15:59:31,wallstreetbets,"The Sub was initially a place where (the majority of) people who knew what they were doing could discuss risky plays where they had done a risk/reward analysis and determined that they wanted to do a risky play.

2021-07-02 16:53:09,wallstreetbets,Uwmc has not experienced the squeeze yet though?
2021-07-02 16:03:25,wallstreetbets,"Oh, definitely. 

In a base sense they're technically correct assuming their goal is to profit from a short squeeze. By its very nature the only way that's actually going to happen is if you swim against the current on a shit stock that everyone is betting against.

They just don't seem to understand how unlikely it is that you actually achieve a short squeeze, and that it's significantly more likely that the price will continue to nosedive.

But hey, it's wallstreetbets, not r/retirementplanning. Go nuts, I say. I just wish people weren't getting suckered into these obvious pump-and-dump schemes on the same few shit tickers we've seen for the past month. Not for their sake, necessarily, but just because it annoys me that some sleazy tool is making a ton of dough off of grifting these rubes."

There‚Äôs no doubt WS and major politics are at play and have been since the election.

2021-07-02 17:02:54,wallstreetbets,"I trimmed my share count for a nice profit as I was way over-weighted on UWMC. However, I let roughly 1200 shares to hold for life at a cost basis of 7.51. If it goes below my cost basis, I'll be purchasing more because it's an amazing company at that price point. 

The reason I'm bullish on this company's ability to make me money is simple:. Covered Calls + Diidend: [https://gyazo.com/471f922b6264239ddcf90edf2dfe074e](https://gyazo.com/471f922b6264239ddcf90edf2dfe074e) 

I'll probably stop at somewhere around 1600-2400 shares depending on how low the share price goes. Getting my cost basis to 7 or lower on an acquisition basis would be stellar. I'd be able to get a 100% cash return in less than 7 years, while still having paper returns."

I don't mind bets, and i do options, but WSB originally was all about biotech companies where the catalysts/clinical trials would either make or break you. Hence, the whole bets/martin shkrehli thing. Obviously there were other plays but people actually made intelligent plays with a underlying thesis/hypothesis.

Even DFV's bet was on a turnaround play, and he bought leaps to give himself time. It was a bet that GME wouldn't go bankrupt. 

If people were doing those types of bets, and not putting their family on the line, I'd feel a lot better about being on the other side for example."

GMs 5% share in RIDE today is equivalent to $82m.

GM has a $92b market cap. Their ""investment"" in RIDE is an opportunity to pick up free money if RIDE can compete against Ford in the pickup market.

The reality is, even their ""pre-order"" vehicles for September won't ship (even if they could produce them) because no fleet manager is going to buy a vehicle from a company that could be out of business in 3 months."

2021-07-02 19:12:04,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-07-02 19:25:56,wallstreetbets,"Alright, first I'll explain why the Housing Market is not a bubble unlike 2008. 

For one, underwriting standards are much stricter. Back then you could get a no money down ARM variable loan, with no proof of income or showing of your debt to income ratio. Nowadays you have to show 2 years worth of income, your debt to income, and you have to put ""skin in the game"" by putting a down payment. Furthermore, the banks are hedged on default by the fact that they can recoup money based off the down payment. So if someone put 20% down for a conventional loan and then defaulted immediately. The House would only need to sell for 80 percent of its value for the lender to be made whole. Finally, the mortgage's are now by and large fixed payment and not variable.

Back then, people who had no verifiable (or loosely verified income) put no money or little money down. They also got ARM variable loans, which spiked when interest rates went up and increased their mortgage payment significantly. So, when they lost their job, they had no equity in the house and thus no reason to try to keep it. They could just walk away scot free (with ruined credit ofc), and the banks/mortgage companies had no cushion due to no or very little down payments.  

Finally, FHA loans and other government loans are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, which is why the down-payment can be as low as 3.5% for an FHA.  

\----------------------------

For UWMC specifically, their forbearance rate from their 10-Q: [https://gyazo.com/403072984dfef11e4b72144e5d1fab77](https://gyazo.com/403072984dfef11e4b72144e5d1fab77) 

This is because of the 740+ credit rating of the people they keep the mortgage servicing rights on, and it's significantly less than half the average for other companies. 

To add to this, they have a fortress like balance sheet with almost 1.6B in cash and cash equivalents alone. 

Finally forbearances in general are going down: [https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/mortgages/articles/mortgage-forbearance-rates-fall-below-4-for-first-time-in-a-year/](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/mortgages/articles/mortgage-forbearance-rates-fall-below-4-for-first-time-in-a-year/)"

I got bored and sold AMC at a small gain at 5,9 hoping I get 20 for it.  But at 50+$ I can‚Äôt see the play anymore. I wish you good luck, I hope I‚Äôm wrong."

2021-07-02 19:39:03,wallstreetbets,Luck
2021-07-02 19:53:47,wallstreetbets,I didn't realize people were still allowed to say wish and amc in the same subreddit. Either way. Good Luck!
2021-07-02 18:36:16,wallstreetbets,"No, because at this point you should be publically shamed for using Robinhood. Collect your 2 brain cells, and dump them."

2021-07-02 17:27:57,wallstreetbets,Trump is a moron and a billionaire so you can be both

2021-07-02 17:41:58,wallstreetbets,He will either be a moron or see a 30% increase at most lol
2021-07-02 17:14:02,wallstreetbets,And he‚Äôs definitely not going to be a billionaire off of shares so‚Ä¶
2021-07-02 18:52:34,wallstreetbets,Lmfao
2021-07-02 19:41:50,wallstreetbets,And he got a better price for it :(
2021-07-02 19:02:19,wallstreetbets,The party is just beginning tho!
2021-07-02 19:54:45,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt understand either. It was trading for $5.70 for almost all of February when I bought in. Does he think it‚Äôs going to compound and go up another 800-1000%?
2021-07-02 19:37:18,wallstreetbets,"I think using 1/10th or 1/20th the amount of $ to control 1000 shares is better than tying up 50,000$ to control 1000 shares of AMC, pick your expiration date and your strike and if it goes really really badly, lose 1/10th the amount."
2021-07-02 17:10:29,wallstreetbets,"For real. If your bulk buying shares the next thing you should be doing is selling covered calls, especially for amc."
2021-07-02 18:14:30,wallstreetbets,You're talking about someone who probably did this with an unironic price target of $100k / share. They won't be selling calls
2021-07-02 19:06:38,wallstreetbets,Someone who buys this much is not in it for 2k a week.  They prolly want 500k per share‚Ä¶
2021-07-02 19:52:55,wallstreetbets,These dudes have no idea what your talking about. Wsb ain‚Äôt the same
2021-07-02 18:31:46,wallstreetbets,"On Robinhood?


I was unaware of that.


(I‚Äôm a beginner with this stuff)"
2021-07-02 18:29:34,wallstreetbets,Isn't that a huge risk on OTM?
2021-07-02 17:01:46,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs shares‚Ä¶.
2021-07-02 19:52:23,wallstreetbets,Is that what they‚Äôre planning to do with people that die with no money in the future?

2021-07-02 17:51:01,wallstreetbets,Top advice here.
2021-07-02 18:08:44,wallstreetbets,HAHAHAHAHA. I laughed way harder than I should have. Good luck to OP but damn.... at least for now it really does seem like buying high.
2021-07-02 19:57:15,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is now a casino"
2021-07-02 19:41:52,wallstreetbets,"I don't think it's a real purchase to be honest, it's a very new account, no history in WSB, and they waited until the stock went up several hundred percent over the last few months to then casually drop $40k on it? It does not add up to me. Where was this person 6 months ago? Why not do it a few weeks ago when it was closing around $30? I don't think it's legit."
2021-07-02 18:36:49,wallstreetbets,I remember when 2k would buy 1000 shares. Still holding a couple hundred from those days!
2021-07-02 16:22:45,wallstreetbets,"They're already up about $800 so they can't be wrong...

I agree though.  At least $49 made sense as sort of a double bounce off support, and they would have ended the day with a solid gain and less chance of a Tuesday gap down putting them in the red."
2021-07-02 16:10:59,wallstreetbets,That's when you're supposed to buy...
2021-07-02 17:42:17,wallstreetbets,"yeah fool, haha always buy at the top and sell at the bottom"
2021-07-02 18:35:12,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood sucks. Not too mention that they suck! 
But the reality is it's user friendly interface is appealing to new investors.
I switched to TD and it's taking me a little bit to get used to things, but it's manageable.ü§î"
2021-07-02 19:32:57,wallstreetbets,Same place as you. Own 200 shares. I see posts with people who have 10k shares. Guessing they got in early
2021-07-02 17:11:53,wallstreetbets,You think OP's buying on the fundamentals?  You're even more retarded than you're claiming OP to be.
2021-07-02 17:58:00,wallstreetbets,Yes and no. The person has only been in WSB for 2 weeks. They likely didn't know the danger of using RH. I have seen a few people trying to educate the OP about it and haven't seen anyone being a dick about it. This is the way it's supposed to be.
2021-07-02 19:36:05,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a good thing we all have you here to be the first one to ever express this sentiment about Robinhood.
2021-07-02 19:24:51,wallstreetbets,What are the better squeeze plays?

Edit - I'm not messing with large amounts like you guys. It's like $50-$100 here and there on stocks. Still stay away?

Edit 2 - Looks like Fidelity it is. Thank you everyone"
2021-07-02 19:13:25,wallstreetbets,Is there another brokerage app that's anywhere near as user friendly and aestheyically pleasing as robinhood? I have robinhood and thinkorswim (by fidelity) and it's comical how ugly and annoying to use thinkorswim is.
2021-07-02 19:33:06,wallstreetbets,Get over it and find some new material jfc
2021-07-02 18:10:38,wallstreetbets,"Genuinely curious why this is being downvoted, my first thought was ‚Äúit‚Äôs not 47k worth of options, it‚Äôs shares‚Ä¶.‚Äù"

2021-07-02 19:28:28,wallstreetbets,"Nah, fam."
2021-07-02 17:17:01,wallstreetbets,Been doing this for 2-3 months. Premiums are coming down but I was averaging $5500-6500 per 1000 shares a week. The premiums are down about 10-15% but it‚Äôs still good money . Bought 500 more shares on the dip today . Didn‚Äôt get the $47 price but got in around $50-$51
2021-07-02 18:32:30,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain covered calls for me? New to the game
2021-07-02 19:34:28,wallstreetbets,This is how hedgefunds are covering their shorts. They are using Robinhood and bragging about it on WSB.
2021-07-02 19:04:10,wallstreetbets,"If you sell a cc otm you stand a better chance of them not getting assigned so your contract expires otm and you keep the premiums. Even if they are assigned, you just re buy the shares and do it again. You can always buy your contracts back if you don‚Äôt want them
Expiring in the money. If your selling in an Ira this isn‚Äôt as big of an issue because you can buy and sell shares without worrying about taxes"
2021-07-02 19:13:18,wallstreetbets,"Common peeps, smoothed brain asking for some knowledge should not get downvoted.  Y'all can be cruel sometimes to newbies.smh"

2021-07-02 16:31:12,wallstreetbets,This is more of a falling knife scenario
2021-07-02 16:48:52,wallstreetbets,"No, you are supposed to buy at the bottom not when it‚Äôs on its way back down to $20"
2021-07-02 18:07:28,wallstreetbets,"You think OP would knowingly put their money into a Ponzi scheme just as the gains are being pulled out, meaning it will soon collapse? Just how retarded is this guy?"
2021-07-02 19:51:44,wallstreetbets,Yeah! Their shenanigans in January left a bad taste in the mouth. With Fidelity now.
2021-07-02 18:50:18,wallstreetbets,We couldn't buy GME and we #neverforgot.
2021-07-02 18:57:28,wallstreetbets,Get fidelity instead
2021-07-02 18:49:23,wallstreetbets,"Multiple outages such as when the stock market tanked beginning of pandemic, restricting certain stocks to closing only during volatility, other general shady stuff. Better to go with brokers that won't tank during unprecedented times such as Fidelity and Vanguard. I'm sure others can go into better detail though."
2021-07-02 19:50:57,wallstreetbets,"We‚Äôll look at the news these days, you‚Äôll understand. Avoid them at any cost. Try Fidelity."
2021-07-02 19:03:46,wallstreetbets,"Dollar amounts are relative.  $50-$100 can mean a lot to you in the right investment, and when that investment is not controlled by YOU, but by your trading platform? Things can get real.  RobbingHood has 49 pending lawsuits THIS YEAR ALONE.  
Fidelity is a sure bet- they clear their own trades, so they have no reason to profit off of you without your express consent. 
But don‚Äôt listen to me, I‚Äôm not a financial advisor; I‚Äôm just an ape with one or two wrinkles in the brain."
2021-07-02 19:21:06,wallstreetbets,"Just download fidelity, I too have used both platforms and fidelity takes the cake imo, Robinhood does offer news stuff for the stocks, but fidelity has got your back when it comes to certain stuff. Fidelity has kept me with their platform for sure"
2021-07-02 19:14:22,wallstreetbets,"Ya just go with Fidelity.  I transferred everything I had over to Fidelity today.  The aesthetics and layout are terrible when compared to RH, but at least I‚Äôll have peace of mind.

You can start out with RH, and get a handle on things; but transfer over to a serious broker if you‚Äôre ready to take things seriously."

2021-07-02 19:34:04,wallstreetbets,"Pick your poison.  They were just fined for 70 million from when their system crashed back on COVID when market was tanking.  Lots of other lawsuits out there for failing to work when it was needed.  Then add in the GME buy button scandal among rounding up your orders in their favor.  Tons and tons of reasons why not to.  Oh yeah, they sell your order flow to Citadel.  They just published their S1 for the IPO and if I remember correctly, 35% of revenue is from Citadel"
2021-07-02 19:36:52,wallstreetbets,Why would you use an app that stops you from trading when they start losing money? No brainer.
2021-07-02 18:43:27,wallstreetbets,"Back during the peak of the GME story robinhood closed trading of it and AMC, and even was selling some people‚Äôs iirc. Most the monkeys here used it so it was bad news. I‚Äôm pretty sure this was it if I got it wrong someone tell me"
2021-07-02 19:46:57,wallstreetbets,Go anywhere but there
2021-07-02 19:49:34,wallstreetbets,They have no customer service at all
2021-07-02 19:57:19,wallstreetbets,Check out SoFi too
2021-07-02 18:51:04,wallstreetbets,"Sure, you can invest $100 on Robinhood, but they might fuck you. You have to keep that in mind as a possibility.

There's no reason to not use a real brokerage like fidelity. It's free, just like Robinhood and they have no minimum. The app isn't as pretty or user friendly but nothing investopedia can't teach you."
2021-07-02 19:35:45,wallstreetbets,"RH has paid fines twice in less than a year for manipulative and deceptive practices. Does that money go to the people who lost money due to RH‚Äôs corruption? Nope, goes to SEC. RH started as the people‚Äôs hero, but ends up they serve the same overlords as every other brokerage and continue to screw individual investors over."
2021-07-02 18:16:56,wallstreetbets,Apes that bought over $50 need to pump the idea that the stock is worth thousands per share so that they can unload their bags with minimal loss.
2021-07-02 18:48:28,wallstreetbets,You were making $5500-$6500 per week off of 1000 shares? So you were selling 10 covered calls a week right? Yeah there‚Äôs no way you were making that in premiums. How is no one questioning this comment that‚Äôs blatantly a lie? Why don‚Äôt you post proof or explain what contracts you were selling and for how much because you either misspoke or you‚Äôre a fucking liar.
2021-07-02 19:19:31,wallstreetbets,About 73 short of a 1000.
2021-07-02 17:40:17,wallstreetbets,Idiot here. How is Covered Call different than a regular Call?
2021-07-02 19:09:05,wallstreetbets,"Does no one realize how absurd this retard is with his lie? So on the low end of his supposed ‚Äúprofits‚Äù, he‚Äôs making $20,000 a month off of only 1000 AMC shares."
2021-07-02 18:44:12,wallstreetbets,"Normally if you are selling options that you do not own, you are exposed to a technically infinite amount of risk. That is called selling naked calls or puts. So if you sell $60 calls for next Friday and it closes at $70 you're out 1G per contract.

If however you own the underlying stock, you can sell covered calls, instead of naked calls, meaning if it doesn't go according to plan and AMC closes at $70 next week, you don't get fucked as badly I think."
2021-07-02 16:49:15,wallstreetbets,"Falling knife at $2, $4, $8, $20, $40, $60...yea yea yeaaaaaaa, get in line"
2021-07-02 18:09:34,wallstreetbets,"The gains are being pulled out now?  Not at 72?  Not at 60+, but now?  Jesus dude this has been going on for 6 months and you had a crystal ball all along?  When you posting those gains?"
2021-07-02 19:04:45,wallstreetbets,Except in 2 months when everyone forgets.
2021-07-02 18:56:13,wallstreetbets,"Do you believe the explanation that RH didn't have the capital to cover the buys on the way up because of the clearinghouse requirements?

I've heard it, and it sounds reasonable that they'd restrict the buy button if the volatility was such that the company wouldn't have the capital to pay that ""deposit"" while the trades settled, but I also could see them saying that just to cover their ""shorts""."
2021-07-02 19:58:25,wallstreetbets,Moron as if robinhood was the only one that did this. Every major broker did this so why the hate for robinhood
2021-07-02 19:53:24,wallstreetbets,If it's terrible you should go for something else.....most of these legacy companies have good website but bad apps
2021-07-02 19:50:58,wallstreetbets,My homie likes Robinhood. Fuck my homie?
2021-07-02 19:54:21,wallstreetbets,"Most of the time, huge gain loss Halts are by the exchanges lol by SEC requirement not by a broker"
2021-07-02 19:44:56,wallstreetbets,"I didn't know that, that's why I'm asking."
2021-07-02 18:53:20,wallstreetbets,This is correct.  Ive got 1000 shares and have been selling covered calls for @ 6 weeks now. Today I sold 10 CC strike $62 expiring 7/9 for $1.40 each right at close.   $1000-$2000 a week is realistic.  $5000 is hard to imagine.
2021-07-02 18:54:46,wallstreetbets,He didn't say weeklies. He could've been getting in and out of montlies  a few times a week quite easily with the volatility it had for awhile. Would not call this a blatant lie.
2021-07-02 18:51:24,wallstreetbets,"Maybe weeklies but it couldn't be way OTM then,"
2021-07-02 19:07:47,wallstreetbets,"Clearly you don‚Äôt follow options. Between 10 contracts and puts its very easy. Sorry you can‚Äôt do math. Premiums as I said are falling. Go back and look at premiers the last 2 months. They were $450-600 per contract 10-12% out of the money. Just because you can‚Äôt figure out how to gain from the markets, some of us can. You would be big mad if you knew how much I was selling on Tsla and gme cc‚Äôs ."
2021-07-02 17:45:12,wallstreetbets,"You may be thinking of buying a call, in which case, they're exactly the same to the buyer. 

For the seller, a covered call means you own the shares, so if you sell a call, you have the collateral already in your account."
2021-07-02 18:45:12,wallstreetbets,"Covered Calls broken down even more for you:

- Stock goes down, you get premium for selling the calls and your losses aren't as great. 

- Stock stays the same, you lose nothing from the stock and gain premium for selling the calls. 

- Stock goes up? You still made money, just not as much as you would've had you just owned the stock (granted, with a stock like AMC, you could severely limit your gains, but profit is profit)."
2021-07-02 17:42:54,wallstreetbets,Covered just means you own the actual shares to be sold if the option is exercised.
2021-07-02 19:16:14,wallstreetbets,"Go back and look at premiums idiot. I said I‚Äôve been doing it for 2-3 months. Premiums were much higher, they are $2.75-$4.00 toady for next Friday and that‚Äôs with .$50-$.90 reduced price today. Math is hard. That‚Äôs 3-4 k a week on lower premiums OTM. Find premiums for may and June, math is easy for you. Sell 1 OTM put for every cc and you can make another $1500-2k"
2021-07-02 19:04:24,wallstreetbets,Thanks. I think I understand‚Ä¶ ish at least. (Prolly shouldnt even be here) lols

2021-07-02 19:35:39,wallstreetbets,"I will also add that if they can't cover, why do you want to be with a broker that doesn't have enough money to run their business."
2021-07-02 19:39:09,wallstreetbets,"Clearinghouse requirements are their problem, it's not an excuse. That means they have a bad business model and can't be trusted."
2021-07-02 19:51:01,wallstreetbets,I do believe so considering they're not a big firm if something fails and people want to withdraw money they're the first one to go
2021-07-02 19:02:56,wallstreetbets,"Even if true, they weren't transparent about it initially. I forget what the initial notice was, but I remember thinking it was BS. Something about protecting us maybe? Been a long year lol.

So probably a grain of truth there but still mostly BS."
2021-07-02 19:03:34,wallstreetbets,"If they can't cover, why not restrict both buys and sells? Restricting only buys forces a single direction of the stock"
2021-07-02 19:57:44,wallstreetbets,"True.  I‚Äôll stick with Fidelity for now though.  The website is just as ugly as the app, but my girlfriend transferred over to Vanguard and theirs are even worse to look at."
2021-07-02 19:43:16,wallstreetbets,Thank you. Here‚Äôs someone that doesn‚Äôt feel the need to lie. I don‚Äôt deny selling CC can make you juicy premiums. But what that idiot OP was posting is a blatant fucking lie.
2021-07-02 18:58:07,wallstreetbets,"Uh nah dude, it would literally have to be after a huge fucking spike where IV is crazy high and it would literally have to be ATM. So either way he‚Äôs not making $5500 to $6500 weekly selling covered calls. How are people that have no idea what the fuck they are talking about, have the most to say. And other fucking idiot monkeys just upvote his comments without fact checking anything. You‚Äôre all fucking sheep."
2021-07-02 18:53:13,wallstreetbets,"yea its def possible, im jelaous. thats where i wanna be. Chad Investor"
2021-07-02 19:20:32,wallstreetbets,"Yeah still doesn‚Äôt add up. Listen, I don‚Äôt give a fuck how much money you‚Äôre making so go get in a dick measuring contest with someone else. The only thing I care about is fuckers lying about shit and misleading others. Contracts were not selling for that much, if I‚Äôm wrong, prove it. Post your contract buys and sells. Prove me wrong buddy, I‚Äôll be waiting for it. 

Maybe you don‚Äôt know shit about options because what your claiming your doing is literally not possible 10% OTM. Like I said, if I‚Äôm wrong. Post your contract buys and sells. 

You even said yourself premiums are down 10-15%. July 9th, $53 calls are selling for $343 per contract. You were claiming you were selling for $550 to 650 per contract. Is that a 10-15% decrease in contract price or are you retarded and can‚Äôt do math?"
2021-07-02 17:46:58,wallstreetbets,"Okay, so since I have 1,000 Shares, that means I can have ten covered calls at max?"
2021-07-02 18:30:33,wallstreetbets,Meaning u LL have to sell those shares if you are assignedüò≥
2021-07-02 18:31:39,wallstreetbets,So you‚Äôre looking for a few dollars above the share price to sell a call?
2021-07-02 19:51:29,wallstreetbets,Because selling doesn't involve margin or funds....
2021-07-02 19:05:25,wallstreetbets,"Good point, but people would be even more extremely angry if they were forced to hold as the price dropped or rose."
2021-07-02 19:23:40,wallstreetbets,A $500 contract with a strike price $15 higher than what the stock was trading at.
2021-07-02 19:23:27,wallstreetbets,"All you do is bump your gums at everyone . Enjoy your sub $1000 portfolio while you rage online. At $343 on 1000 shares that‚Äôs almost 13k a month. While your mad in your Cheerios, I‚Äôll make sometimes 6 figures a week. Take a break from the internet, you seem triggered and can‚Äôt handle it. Have a great weekend."
2021-07-02 18:09:47,wallstreetbets,"With 1,000 shares you can sell 10 covered-calls.  If you didn‚Äôt have the shares and sold the calls, they would be ‚Äònaked‚Äô with the potential to lose an infinite amount of money."
2021-07-02 17:59:53,wallstreetbets,Yes exactly.
2021-07-02 17:48:28,wallstreetbets,"I want to say yes, but I'm also kind of an idiot with stonks. I'm sure your broker will limit you appropriately, lol."
2021-07-02 18:36:20,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but ideally you sell 'em with a strike price where you still make profit compared to what you originally paid. If not, you are an absolute moron."
2021-07-02 18:35:20,wallstreetbets,It depends entirely on your opinion of the company and what you think the stock is going to do. If I were selling Calls of AMC I'd go at least 60-70 strike price. Maybe even higher considering all the variables in motion at the moment. AMC has been over 60 a few times in the last month. I wouldn't consider that a safe strike price to sell a call.
2021-07-02 19:31:14,wallstreetbets,"Lmao I don‚Äôt know how old you are but it‚Äôs funny you think I don‚Äôt have an account size bigger than yours but I digress. Whatever makes you feel big tough guy. 

First of all, I‚Äôve asked you to simply end this argument by positing proof of your contract buys and sells. I‚Äôm still waiting chicken shit. 

Second, yeah that‚Äôs if you sell ATM calls and you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre shares are going to get called away when you‚Äôre selling ATM or in your fantasy world, does that never happen? And didn‚Äôt you say you were selling 10-12% OTM? Yeah you really don‚Äôt understand how dumb you sound. So 10-12% OTM calls for July 9th is $168. So how does that math work out for ya? Is $168 a 10-15% decrease in contract price like you‚Äôre claiming from $550-650? God you are so dumb it hurts my soul trying to talk to you. 

Third, you didn‚Äôt address anything I‚Äôve said.

Yeah I am triggered. I‚Äôm triggered by people like you lying and spreading false info on this sub. People like you disgust me. What are you even lying for?

I‚Äôll end with this, IF IM WRONG, POST PROOF. Post a pic of your contract buys and sells and I‚Äôll shut right up. Come on buddy prove me wrong."
2021-07-02 19:10:42,wallstreetbets,So even if i dont have 100 shares of gme i can sell a covered call?
2021-07-02 18:18:45,wallstreetbets,Assuming he's not on margin.
2021-07-02 18:39:09,wallstreetbets,Or don't sell?
2021-07-02 19:05:29,wallstreetbets,"Question: when you sell a covered call, do you collect both the premium from the sale and the cost of exercise if you're assigned? Or just the premium?"
2021-07-02 19:47:06,wallstreetbets,"No, that's called a naked call. DO NOT DO THAT, especially on volatile stocks. If you say sold a naked call and got $300 in premium you might think WOW THIS IS AWESOME, until the stock goes from $50 to $200 and then you suddenly have to shell out $20,000 to buy the 100 shares and sell them for $50 each (or whatever you strike was), causing a $15,000 loss, which is not cool

A covered call is covered because you already own the shares. So even if it went to $200, you'd have to sell your shares for $50 each (or whatever the strike was), which sucks but isn't going to cause a huge ass loss (assuming you bought them originally bellow strike price)"
2021-07-02 19:36:45,wallstreetbets,"You would have to be approved for the highest level of options trading, naked calls and puts. If you aren‚Äôt already trading options, I doubt you would be eligible for that trading. You have to trade in blocks of 100 shares. Each contract is an obligation to buy or sell 100 shares at the strike price you pick. Farther from the current price, the lower the premiums. When I want to buy a stock, I‚Äôll sell closer to the money puts, collect the premium and buy the stock if it dips. That lowers your price per share so you can sell closer to the money calls. If they get called away on shares you bought from the assignment of a call, you collected the premium from the put and the cc."
2021-07-02 18:21:17,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but then they wouldn't be ""covered""."
2021-07-02 19:23:30,wallstreetbets,"Yes. You get the premium at the time of sale, and 100x the strike price at exercise."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQBubLv49fk"
2021-07-02 16:11:31,wallstreetbets,Depends on how long you want to hold and what your return goals are. I usually buy intranasal and set tight stops for a good entry.
2021-07-02 18:00:59,wallstreetbets,Find something else where shit lines up across multiple time frames
2021-07-02 19:35:23,wallstreetbets,Macd looks topped out so looks like the hourly is BUY is just to drain the volume before it feathers down due to the 1D chart showing signs of s light retracement. I'd wait till 1D macd and RSI go back lower and they start to close above 20 before looking for an entry
2021-07-02 17:36:52,wallstreetbets,It means you should draw more colorful line that don‚Äôt mean jack shit
2021-07-02 15:19:53,wallstreetbets,"Buy now, sell in two hours lol üòÇ it looks like a juicy bite, but then I‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ is this gunna give me diarrhea later?"

2021-07-02 16:25:08,wallstreetbets,"True, I was selling covered calls and they exercised at $60. Now I‚Äôm wanting to get back in. Intranasal with Tight Stops may be the way to Tig‚Äôole Gains. Will see what Monday/Tuesday bring"
2021-07-02 18:03:53,wallstreetbets,Good call. I shouldn‚Äôt force myself into something that isn‚Äôt 100% gold. I too often think I‚Äôm buying Gucci and it turns out to be H&M
2021-07-02 19:50:08,wallstreetbets,"I really like this explanation. Simple to understand. I appreciate it, üôè"
2021-07-02 18:12:33,wallstreetbets,"Yep, take the easy trades. Different stocks are just better trades at different times. It‚Äôs important to be nimble so you‚Äôre always after the strongest names. 

Sounds counterintuitive but it‚Äôs usually best to just wait for a big move up on a name (preferably with high volume) before you even bother with it. Just let the momentum make itself clear first. You see most of the big gains in here are multi day moves on a name that goes 20+% very quickly. Nothing wrong with waiting for that first 5%."

2021-07-02 15:06:24,wallstreetbets,I do it by losing 80% of my trades.  Makes going to work pretty mandatory.
2021-07-02 15:26:06,wallstreetbets,You want to keep your job and have consistent income so that you don‚Äôt have to withdraw from your investment account
2021-07-02 16:19:36,wallstreetbets,You're making money?!
2021-07-02 14:59:31,wallstreetbets,I just think about all of the Wendy‚Äôs shareholders that are counting on me to serve up chicken tenders
2021-07-02 15:03:40,wallstreetbets,Children and health insurance. ONLY two reasons i‚Äôm still working full time
2021-07-02 15:21:19,wallstreetbets,It helps that I lose money instead of making it.
2021-07-02 14:58:55,wallstreetbets,"Just go through the motions, honestly, real job is just for insurance, do enough to stay employed basically.

Be a drone at work, do nothing, and make money trading, its the best way."
2021-07-02 17:42:05,wallstreetbets,"I feel ya.  Hell, I'm a friggin' attorney and my money makes a lot more money than I do.  

I keep working because honestly, it gives me something to do, keeps me sharp, gets me interacting with people, and I feel good about myself knowing that I'm out there working for my family.

If I were to retire now, I'd lose the societal respect that comes with being a working man (I'm 37 years old).  Plus, I'd probably waste most of my time at home playing video games and driving my wife crazy.

It's crazy, literally crazy how much money my money makes..."
2021-07-02 17:39:25,wallstreetbets,My job pays the bills. My investments my early retirement.

2021-07-02 15:46:52,wallstreetbets,"Dont look at it as one is making more than the other. Look at it as a faster way to retire from it all.

Get yourself 10 to 20 million in the bank and walk away from both."
2021-07-02 15:22:20,wallstreetbets,If you make that much trading just get onto your wife‚Äôs boyfriends insurance
2021-07-02 15:31:09,wallstreetbets,Because we're not in 2008-2009 where you lost 80%. Bull market has had a super long run.

2021-07-02 17:42:53,wallstreetbets,"I like my job, the stocks are just extra money for the future. My wife is a stay at home mom, my federal retirement and my military stuff may or may not be enough for both of us. My stocks are just like a side gig, and these gains are not certain."

2021-07-02 16:45:41,wallstreetbets,I live in Canada for the health insurance

2021-07-02 18:48:11,wallstreetbets,"In all honesty though what would you do with your time? Travel? Experience new things, then fuck it do it.

2021-07-02 19:36:28,wallstreetbets,If you just need the insurance why not just switch to an easier job that you can get it at? Hell if I didn't have to worry about pay I'd be tempted to go back to loading and unloading trucks in a warehouse.  It kept me in great shape and there was no shitty office politics or snarky cuntbags bitching about stupid bullshit to worry about.

2021-07-02 19:22:56,wallstreetbets,80% more then your job?????? Makes me wonder why your even on Reddit at all.
2021-07-02 19:37:46,wallstreetbets,its the health insurance and visa that keeps me motivated. isn't it
2021-07-02 19:47:02,wallstreetbets,I just view it as my job gives me more dispensable income I can put towards more stocks. It makes you less stressed cos if you lose you know you can just make it back. It enables you to take riskier trades and not be such a pussy.

2021-07-02 18:33:12,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm not sure if OP is a troll or he‚Äôs serious. Most redditers make 6-8% return just like everyone else unless they are taking massive risks. And most redditers have under $100k in investable assets. The whole point is to make as much money as possible whether it‚Äôs through work or investing
2021-07-02 15:18:14,wallstreetbets,"Or just take current job more seriously, i cant possibly think of an easier way to make over 100k without a degree."

2021-07-02 14:50:50,wallstreetbets,Yep all in they WON a big contract to replace all buses in Miami
2021-07-02 16:38:59,wallstreetbets,This has been my major play for awhile now.  My small city purchased their busses over a year ago. Lots of room to grow and they are already major players in the commercial EV space.  No reason they shouldn‚Äôt convert all the school busses too.
2021-07-02 15:15:18,wallstreetbets,Had the same thought but playing shares only for now.

2021-07-02 15:49:44,wallstreetbets,They can supply a full EV bus fleet and infrastructure. I wonder what other mayor city is jumping on this beside Miami and New York? Or who else is in negotiation right now
2021-07-02 14:51:56,wallstreetbets,They have a pilot program in NYC üëÄ
2021-07-02 18:31:42,wallstreetbets,"Also, I want to correct this, it‚Äôs not all, Miami has 33 proterra buses already and they are getting 42 more. From what else I‚Äôve read though is they are expanding their charging stations in the area so may be potentially to buy more in the future.

But for now, they are far from replacing all of the non-EV buses."
2021-07-02 19:36:20,wallstreetbets,Market cap was updated today

I missed out on it tho this week chasing some other stocks and now I learned my lesson not to stray from my bestie Microsoft

2021-07-02 16:28:25,wallstreetbets,I think fears of housing market slowing down may be overblown. Once people start realizing this UWMC may recover back to highs.

2021-07-02 14:47:43,wallstreetbets,UWMC is undervalued and soon will be rocking

2021-07-02 15:07:20,wallstreetbets,My wife plays quick swing with everyone but me .
2021-07-02 15:09:08,wallstreetbets,In with 105 shares of UWMC
2021-07-02 18:55:48,wallstreetbets,After amc popped the first time I watched amc every day to se what it was doing. It jumped and dumped between 9-12 for a long time and then it shot up. I believe these genius apes were swing trading it and not worrying about averages. I believe your TA to be correct but one misstep in timing and it could shoot to 28 again leaving you in the dust. CLOV=buy and hold. Buy more when possible.
2021-07-02 15:57:38,wallstreetbets,The dividend payment from $UWMC on July 6th should give it a bit of a boost assuming most people will reinvest their dividends
2021-07-02 14:43:37,wallstreetbets,CLOV 16% isn't too much? Is that based on good news or  pure TA?
2021-07-02 14:39:26,wallstreetbets,Another one i like to swing trade is TRVG any time its in the low 3$ i buy and hold for a couple days

2021-07-02 18:09:30,wallstreetbets,If it gets down below my cost basis I'll buy in again. I think 9 is a pretty fair price for this. And I'm in at 7.38.
2021-07-02 19:01:01,wallstreetbets,"UWMC pays a 5% dividend.  If RKT paid a decent divvy, I would probably own that too.

2021-07-02 14:49:01,wallstreetbets,"at its 3 month low that it bounced off a couple times right now, not a bad entry imo"
2021-07-02 18:34:27,wallstreetbets,"That would be cool, I'm writing it off in my mind, but it was a big mistake. If a lifeline happens that would be so cool.."
2021-07-02 15:01:56,wallstreetbets,I noticed that (re: 3 month low). When do you typically exit with TRVG? $3.75-ish?
2021-07-02 15:42:09,wallstreetbets,the last couple times i did it i bought 300 shares and set sell orders at 3.70 3.75 and 3.80. but if you wanna hold it you could sell calls against your shares

2021-07-02 18:47:28,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve got calls for 8/20 so hopefully i can at least break even.
2021-07-02 17:32:04,wallstreetbets,This week was definitely going to be a down week with the lockup expiration and a shit ton of open interest on 7/2 $20 calls. MM we‚Äôre going to keep this pinned down. Hopefully it starts climbing next week. I‚Äôm bag holding shares as well.

2021-07-02 15:25:55,wallstreetbets,it was recommended on the cnbc as a long play.... bought more at this price.  I think the lock up expiration has played out or insiders aren't selling at this huge discount.
2021-07-02 18:30:26,wallstreetbets,"I do agree with many here that sofi is taken down unjustly due to the lockup. If I were the OG investor, why would I want to sell a $30 stock at less than $20?  Just doesn't make much sense.

If I recalled correctly, one of the managers from the CNBC Fast Money with Melissa also mentioned sofi was a buy last night.  That's in addition to the one from Fast Money Half-Time this morning.   GLTA."

2021-07-02 19:14:56,wallstreetbets,"I believe it. There has been a core group of us who have been quietly buying this stuff up way before anyone on WSB put it on here.

To be completely honest, I have no clue why it trended on WSB.

This is not a short squeeze play. LOL. 

I would get whatever you can. Or just buy shares.

My calls are exclusively so I can execute shares. I plan on holding this like it‚Äôs Tesla 5 years ago.

Social Finance and 23&Me are my 2 highest conviction 6month-3year plays."

2021-07-02 18:32:38,wallstreetbets,The time horizon is long enough that you should probably forget about it for a while lol. Itll be an eventual tenbagger at these prices though
2021-07-02 18:39:36,wallstreetbets,"My personal opinion is this stock first goes to $30, and I say that may happen in 5-6 months.

Then beyond that, I see $100/share by end of next year.

In 4 years, I think it could go $400-700/share.

Just my opinion. Not financial advice. I think this is one stock you treat like Amazon/Google/Apple during the Early days.

This is not a squeeze play, it‚Äôs an investment play."
2021-07-02 18:50:34,wallstreetbets,"I was holding calls when it spiked up to $24 and made decent money, bought back in when it dipped to $21 and it's been basically straight down since"
2021-07-02 15:14:12,wallstreetbets,Best possible choice. No way this one stays under $30 for long
2021-07-02 15:14:59,wallstreetbets,Yea its great I just kept adding to it that whole time with their money. UWMC is another high interest % one. Been at 12% APY for the past 1-2 months steady.
2021-07-02 19:28:13,wallstreetbets,"I know where you heard about those plays.  Same place I did. ü•Ø 

Wish I had bought calls on SOFI earlier, but I have shares that I‚Äôm happy to sit on for years until they make me a small fortune."
2021-07-02 19:20:56,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I bought at $21 before it hit $24, I got in a bit late and bought it after it sold off a bit when the ticker changed. I was sure it was going to moon, I was holding calls that day it went up over 10% and cashed in a bunch and have been steadily selling puts and buying more calls (also holding shares) but I've just been getting murdered on it the last couple weeks. 

I'm pretty new to early stage public company investing and didn't realize so many PIPE shares were unlocking causing the sell off, so I'll eat those losses as a cost of learning, it's a bit disheartening just expecting it to sell off 4% every day and it just keeps going down, hoping this is the bottom"
2021-07-02 18:49:36,wallstreetbets,"i‚Äôm genuinely clueless as to how much fintech stocks can go up, that‚Äôs why i asked, i‚Äôm not planning on selling it anytime soon, if anything i‚Äôll buy more, see you all on the moonüöÄ"
2021-07-02 15:29:33,wallstreetbets,The issue is I've got calls... Expiring July 16...
2021-07-02 15:15:36,wallstreetbets,Almost like you found a glitch in the matrix
2021-07-02 18:58:04,wallstreetbets,I've basically just stopped buying calls less than 6months out. It's just nonsense that bites me more than it pays me.
2021-07-02 15:30:02,wallstreetbets,Same here. Had a few expire today too
2021-07-02 15:30:53,wallstreetbets,"I'm new to options, why let an option expire rather than selling at the last second? Was it's value 0"
2021-07-02 15:31:41,wallstreetbets,"Well if you‚Äôre an idiot like me and hold it too long, depending on the strike price sometimes there are zero buyers"
2021-07-02 18:59:38,wallstreetbets,"I have some options I bought cheap on a whim that are down -98% expiring next month.

There's really no point in selling now, there could be some price action in the next month (doubtful enough to make it up, but who knows.)"
2021-07-02 15:34:28,wallstreetbets,"That'd make sense, but it's not real money just numbers *keep telling yourself this it helps*"

2021-07-02 13:49:00,wallstreetbets,SOFI is undervalued AF right now
2021-07-02 16:28:45,wallstreetbets,SOFI is cheap. Its not even a meme really. Its just a fintech play thats slightly undervalued. Not sure why they shorted it except that its a Chamath stock.
2021-07-02 15:18:21,wallstreetbets,"SOFI, CLNE, and UWMC are ones that wsb has pumped that I have in my portfolio.  The rest I'm not feeling, but who really knows."
2021-07-02 14:53:28,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm buying robbinhood puts as soon as they have their IPO
2021-07-02 13:42:41,wallstreetbets,Ill look into Charles Schwab too
2021-07-02 13:46:12,wallstreetbets,"Recently most stonks that have been mentioned on WSB have been pump and dumps (MVIS, CLOV, WISH etc) but SoFi definitely looks undervalued and it seems like a good long term play"
2021-07-02 13:42:01,wallstreetbets,"Mention SoFi, get upvote. I like that stock."
2021-07-02 19:28:04,wallstreetbets,I would put in PSFE rather Sofi. I wwill wait until sofi cools down
2021-07-02 15:21:47,wallstreetbets,Galileo is the number 1 reason I'm so bullish on SoFi. It basically makes them like the Twilio of Fintech
2021-07-02 14:14:23,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood valuation is really inflated due to good 2020 revenue. I agree they disrupted brokerage and margin, but now there's nothing special about them. If Robinhood maintains their valuation post IPO (and I won't be surprised that it will increase), then I'll be convinced that SoFi is extremely undervalued."

2021-07-02 18:16:18,wallstreetbets,Isn‚Äôt shorting around lockup expiration when the price is reasonably high the norm?
2021-07-02 16:32:23,wallstreetbets,Probably pipe investors shorted their positions to hedge against lockup dips. I would assume that it will go back to normal short interest soon. I don't think Chamath impacts SoFi anymore.
2021-07-02 14:54:31,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately options aren't available immediately when company IPOs. A good alternative could be shorting if your brokerage allows :)
2021-07-02 14:34:59,wallstreetbets,I've Schwab and vanguard. Both are pretty decent brokerages but have an obscure UI. I didn't partake in GME so not sure if they blocked trading or not.
2021-07-02 14:14:50,wallstreetbets,Fidelity? I heard they didn't blocked share buying on the GME fiasco
2021-07-02 14:47:39,wallstreetbets,I personally use fidelity and they did not restrict GME during the squeeze. I also had a pretty hilarious convo with their CS over a good faith violation i incurred when CLOV spiked to $28.
2021-07-02 14:46:41,wallstreetbets,The three stocks I picked up from WSB are CRSR SOFI and PSFE I don‚Äôt expect any of these to moon overnight but I think they are good solid long term value plays.
2021-07-02 13:48:40,wallstreetbets,"Allow me to be blunt: Perhaps WSB might try to pump and dump SoFi under the pretense of a short squeeze, but those who think they can actually achieve this feat are just missing some brain cells and/or are blind followers."
2021-07-02 19:34:48,wallstreetbets,SoFi and PSFE are miles apart in what they offer...

2021-07-02 18:33:01,wallstreetbets,Sure makes sense.

2021-07-02 14:31:16,wallstreetbets,You doubled down on the same contract?! You must hate your money üòÖ coulda atleast grabbed a further out
2021-07-02 13:37:45,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt like money either.
2021-07-02 14:04:56,wallstreetbets,You spent $55k on deep OTM calls. I‚Äôm impressed. Can you teach me your ways
2021-07-02 14:40:24,wallstreetbets,Hope you can recover that in a year or two
2021-07-02 16:32:57,wallstreetbets,Bro holy shit fucking sell that shit before you lose the rest of your money. Learn a bit more about options before you YOLO 55K on deep OTM short expiry calls ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Like idk if this is even liquid enough for you to actually sell those at this point.
2021-07-02 17:20:18,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt know how you do it or what you know, but because if you I‚Äôm holding my July 20s. Sink together; someone cue the violins."
2021-07-02 17:02:46,wallstreetbets,Guh indeed..

2021-07-02 17:13:31,wallstreetbets,"You will be the new WSB Jesus if these go in the money.  I will personally send you some chicken tenders if it hits, because then I will be rich."
2021-07-02 13:36:39,wallstreetbets,After this gets me my $ back next week
2021-07-02 18:47:24,wallstreetbets,"SOFI is set up for a gamma/delta squeeze in the next week. If the price can hit and hold $20 you're going to start seeing jumps from strike price to strike price just because of all the open volume. 

A jump to the next strike price increases Delta across the entire board which equals more share being bought and another jump in price. 

The options chain for the 16th is pretty crazy so hit and hold $20 and $30 is just a few hours away.

Just my personal opinion and not financial advice."
2021-07-02 13:39:05,wallstreetbets,"If we get more $$$ flowing into that, gamma squeeze say no more"

2021-07-02 13:54:36,wallstreetbets,Deadbeats lurking now
2021-07-02 14:33:20,wallstreetbets,I was lucky enough to realize I got sucked into a pump & dump and jumped ship before it hurt too much.
2021-07-02 18:08:52,wallstreetbets,You never fucking know! Good luck fucktardüöÄ
2021-07-02 15:09:50,wallstreetbets,It is possible to YOLO on a good contract too. Time isn't the devil. FDs are not the only way to becoming rich. Regardless of what subreddit this is. Retard
2021-07-02 16:01:28,wallstreetbets,"I scooped up 8 more shares as well on the dip, diamond hands is the only way."
2021-07-02 16:49:46,wallstreetbets,The emotions are high in this one.  I can sense it
2021-07-02 16:58:10,wallstreetbets,"You've only lost 32k so far, what could go wrong"
2021-07-02 17:09:23,wallstreetbets,It's done for. Aint hitting 30 in two weeks. Shoulda sold and grabbed 1/22 30c instead
2021-07-02 17:10:53,wallstreetbets,Who knows a contract that will print 200 plus percent in 2 weeks would like to recover my losses for the week üòÜü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2021-07-02 17:47:53,wallstreetbets,True retard move
2021-07-02 17:51:57,wallstreetbets,Same time next week ?
2021-07-02 18:24:27,wallstreetbets,I needed this today. Makes my losses look like pennies
2021-07-02 18:51:54,wallstreetbets,dude the pumps and dumps here last about 10 minutes. not 2-3 weeks lol
2021-07-02 19:18:06,wallstreetbets,Damn Gina!!
2021-07-02 19:18:49,wallstreetbets,"What‚Äôs really fucked is if they had just bought longer calls or fuck it, just shares‚Ä¶

This SoFi is a fundamentally undervalued stock that will probably become a Titan in the DeFi space.

I could see $30/share EOY. I could see $400-700 in 3-5 years."
2021-07-02 19:46:23,wallstreetbets,That target is way too aggressive . I think by 7/16 will be $22
2021-07-02 19:47:35,wallstreetbets,Still got 2 weeks‚Ä¶there‚Äôs still a chance
2021-07-02 13:43:29,wallstreetbets,GUHHHHHHH.
2021-07-02 14:16:51,wallstreetbets,Get some margin and triple down like a real retard
2021-07-02 14:50:47,wallstreetbets,This is how a bad trade turns into a really bad trade.
2021-07-02 14:54:09,wallstreetbets,I also hate money. Bought more.
2021-07-02 14:15:13,wallstreetbets,Why money if you can have Sofi?
2021-07-02 15:00:35,wallstreetbets,Wonder what he does for real fun.
2021-07-02 17:45:28,wallstreetbets,"OP could have bought a few (or handful) of AMZN OTM monthlies this morning during dips.

Then collect 30-35% by EOD. A less stressful 12-15k in profit.

But what's the fun in that.

 Might as well load up on OTM short term expiry on a strike that had NEVER been hit, and avg down when the play went against him."
2021-07-02 13:41:32,wallstreetbets,"You did everything right. Invest emotionally and when you're worried, double down. It may go wrong once, but lightning doesn't strike the same place twice. Absolutely nothing can go wrong here. üëç"
2021-07-02 19:23:27,wallstreetbets,"I can get you your money back with this next stock tip play:

Buy calls for S P C E. The Virgin galactic commercial flight company.

Make those calls expire AFTER Jul11.

They just announced the next flight is the weekend of the 10-11th.

Every time, the stock rallied A CRAZY AMOUNT, before dying back down.

Basically, you buy calls ASAP for beyond the 7/11 date, and you place a strike anywhere from ATM to $50 strike.

Then watch this thing run up to next Friday, then, your choice, sell before flight, or sell on the good news after flight.

I did this last space flight and made a fuckin KILLING.

I‚Äôm doing it again.

Just look at the graph last 3 months. That volatility is crazy. Pretty predictable."
2021-07-02 14:07:07,wallstreetbets,The sell off happens AFTER the lockup period tho.
2021-07-02 13:56:56,wallstreetbets,His option expires 7/16
2021-07-02 13:47:15,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm trying to make my $ back.. thought u were sopose to double down on dips and wait for it to bounce back ?
2021-07-02 17:52:37,wallstreetbets,"Buy Sofi contracts that expire on the 16

Trust me

-bro"
2021-07-02 14:53:21,wallstreetbets,so double down is always bad?
2021-07-02 16:42:51,wallstreetbets,for a mere 2 weeks...
2021-07-02 19:56:26,wallstreetbets,"Hindsight is a fantastic thing, are you on your way to the cancer ward next to tell the patients they shouldn't have smoked?"
2021-07-02 13:53:49,wallstreetbets,"Lol, I think I got your sarcasm."
2021-07-02 14:12:14,wallstreetbets,"Yes aka the dip now, next lockup expires July 30 so chamath will be dumping shares then"
2021-07-02 14:01:10,wallstreetbets,"Yes thats before July 29th, so if the price will increase until July 29th the 7/16 calls are before that date. That would mean OP should be fine. If we have rearranged the dates in July please let me know so I can update my office."
2021-07-02 13:55:29,wallstreetbets,"Your ability to wait for it to bounce back is not very good if it expires 7/16.    Buy shares or LEAPS if you want to be able to wait it out.

Looking at the bright side you‚Äôve gained some education in option trading."
2021-07-02 14:08:09,wallstreetbets,"That only applies to individual stock holdings, not exactly true with options since you're getting killed on your Theta and what a Theta you got there. Each and every day, including NON-TRADING days, you're losing 0.03 every day. By Monday morning assuming the stock price hasn't changed, you already lost $0.06.

But who knows, maybe on Sunday night they'll get a buy-out offer. Best of luck to you."
2021-07-02 15:31:54,wallstreetbets,"I think if he had double downed in like august calls it wouldn‚Äôt have been as bad
 But double down on a short exp just to lower your average isn‚Äôt ideal"
2021-07-02 15:36:02,wallstreetbets,On options yes. Because they are supposed to be a hedge to a long or short position. But retarded apes think options is the only way (to lose it all)
2021-07-02 19:04:28,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs just letting your emotions take hold instead of being smart lol
2021-07-02 17:31:59,wallstreetbets,"who cares what chamath does, the company is solid and i‚Äôll be buying more at a discount"
2021-07-02 14:13:46,wallstreetbets,Okay I got you!  Just sayin he‚Äôd been better off with an 8/20 call and sell on 7/29 to take full advantage of your price forecast.
2021-07-02 16:54:25,wallstreetbets,"when you start understanding IV and the greeks, magic happens. I bought bull call spreads on SOFI two days ago and I'm not losing as much money as if I had bought shares. And as the time passes, if price remains stable, my options increase in value. 

OP is fuk"
2021-07-02 14:15:09,wallstreetbets,"Yeah id hold 7/16s through next week, and purchase 8/20s around 8/2"

2021-07-02 17:50:37,wallstreetbets,"Not sustainable by a long shot lmao. HMA, RSI, squeeze indicators are through the roof above normal highs and this is all followed by lower volume than average. It will tank, maybe not a huge correction but it will"
2021-07-02 14:23:51,wallstreetbets,Also I didn‚Äôt make the money from buying stocks i made it from option calls.
2021-07-02 14:22:20,wallstreetbets,Wrong.

2021-07-02 17:14:50,wallstreetbets,ETF index but yeah
2021-07-02 17:24:55,wallstreetbets,"Well, In short yes. Although it‚Äôs not wise to hold a option call to expiration because theta is a mom fucker. Options involve buying a contract where instead of buying one share you basically buy 100 shares at a smaller price. With this smaller price buy in; fluctuations in price on percent gain or loss will be wildly magnified. Often best to sell a week before the option expires as theta is tenfold during the final week. Lastly, buy ITM option calls or puts and not OTM and have a expiration day minimum 2 weeks out unless your very bullish or bearish or you have a very high risk tolerance."
2021-07-02 17:59:57,wallstreetbets,Market recovered from covid and went parabolic. Absolutely bonkers bull run as well. And as when to buy in I couldn‚Äôt tell but maybe around 420
2021-07-02 14:29:37,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs has nothing to do with my gains. I bought a fraction of spy to monitor it. Scroll to the bottom of the picture. Bought 431 and 430 strike prices that expire 7/7. Each dollar it went up, the delta I currently had was added on to the premium, thus increasing premium price. Theres a lot more too it but that‚Äôs the basics"
2021-07-02 18:50:29,wallstreetbets,Fuck it I‚Äôm in puts on spy!!
2021-07-02 15:27:54,wallstreetbets,I wouldn‚Äôt say so. Watched the buying volume come in before close and and it usurped the entire days volume in buying. It had some DD
2021-07-02 18:16:24,wallstreetbets,How far in the money do you suggest?
2021-07-02 14:31:06,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-07-02 18:28:40,wallstreetbets,"1 day profit is pure luck, mate (for which I congratulate you). You yolo'd when you bought them, because there's no way to predict buying volume continuing to increase without insider knowledge. Consequently there's no such thing as DD for a 1 day trade or intraday trading. DD by nature applies to statistical trends."
2021-07-02 15:31:27,wallstreetbets,"Lol if you think you can double your money in a day on a trade that isn't super high risk, you're going to have an interesting time going forward."
2021-07-02 14:35:32,wallstreetbets,Yeah I accidentally cropped out the strike prices but you can see the return on the 27 contracts
2021-07-02 18:45:26,wallstreetbets,"I have about a 85% win rate on spy. It‚Äôs not purely luck , I use indicators and also dabble In day trading spy options."

2021-07-02 15:05:52,wallstreetbets,"With the short positions starts to cover, along with an improved economic outlook and increasing oil price, the company's fundamental is significantly improving. I thin this can go much higher than $20 if the narrative continues."
2021-07-02 14:15:56,wallstreetbets,"Hmm, I'm not sure you're giving yourself enough time.  Even at the $5.50 strike price, I would like to see August instead of 7/16, but it can happen and you need to keep an eye on it like a hawk though."
2021-07-02 15:59:25,wallstreetbets,I bought at $5 two days ago. It went back down immediately after but now it‚Äôs back up again

2021-07-02 13:09:22,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but the covered call that earned you a premium of $15 is not really going to do anything to hedge against the losses on that stock. On top of that, if the stock does moon before your expiration you give up a lot of growth for what? A $15 premium?"
2021-07-02 13:29:33,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you understood correctly. Example of your worst case scenario:

On July 9, WISH price is $69.  Assuming you didn't ""buy to close"" your own contract on or before July 9, your covered call contract for $18 strike price is going to get assigned 100%. In that case, your **missed extra profits** will be ($69-$18)\*100 = $5,100. 

You don't lose money, but you will miss extra tendies.

Sure, there's the matter of missing extra premium if you sold the CC when the share price rockets, but that's a little more than my smooth brain wants to think about."
2021-07-02 13:12:37,wallstreetbets,"If the stock passes your strike price set, if you want to retain your 100 shares before getting assigned, you're going to have to buy to close the option potentially at a loss of premium depending on IV and premium price. You can sell another covered call deeper OTM at another date and roll the option up and out (higher strike price, later date). Otherwise, hold on tight."
2021-07-02 16:07:40,wallstreetbets,"You shouldn't be writing covered calls that far out of the money. It's not worth having your stocks tied up for such a small premium imo. If you think it's going to go up that much you'd be MUCH better off waiting to sell calls after a big spike. Covered calls are meant to play around the ""at the money"" line to maximize your premium gained."
2021-07-02 13:30:20,wallstreetbets,Yes; that‚Äôs exactly what will happen if it closes above $18 at expiry. You can also roll up and out if it starts getting close.
2021-07-02 13:06:40,wallstreetbets,$Wish will hit $30 by july 9
2021-07-02 14:55:51,wallstreetbets,"I fucked up, bros. I 'wish'd upon a star too early. Please fly."
2021-07-02 14:04:14,wallstreetbets,You are doing it right my man
2021-07-02 13:00:33,wallstreetbets,seems about right.
2021-07-02 14:28:23,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre doing it right. Been selling cc‚Äôs on Wish for the last couple weeks. Collected Over $4,000 in premiums."
2021-07-02 13:44:33,wallstreetbets,This belongs in /r/thetagang
2021-07-02 16:05:29,wallstreetbets,"Just think of it as setting a limit sell with benefits. If you think you'd sell at 18, you're doing it right. If you aren't ok with selling at 18, chasing 15$ in premium probably isn't worth it."
2021-07-02 13:01:42,wallstreetbets,"You're going to get eaten alive in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...."
2021-07-02 13:07:00,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-07-02 15:52:40,wallstreetbets,"You can always try to set your strike price a little bit lower, but still above your cost basis, the premium will be better but if you're expecting some sideways trading in the next few weeks, it might be worth it. Also, learn to read the Greeks and start looking at the option chain and learn about Delta/Theta/Gamma and how those and the other Greeks impact the option price.

If you can afford another 100 shares, sell 1 contract and keep 100 shares on the side in case if it moons. I do this with a some Berry shares(XXXX shares), sell contracts 1/2/3 weeks out and keep XXX shares on the side in case it moons.

Big downsides is if the stock price plummets and never recovers, you have a high cost basis and the premiums aren't worth it, or the price moons and you miss out on the profit gap between your strike price and the moon price(which is why I recommended picking up another 100 shares if you can to put on the sideline)."

2021-07-02 16:46:08,wallstreetbets,I think you made a good choice. Seems the only way to make $15 on WISH is either buying puts or selling calls ffs. Same w CLNE
2021-07-02 13:34:08,wallstreetbets,"Well, if the stock hits $18, I would make about $6.50 a share, which I would be fine with. I don't really think $WISH is going to the moon, but I do think it's worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $20.00, so if I sold at $18, I'd take that.

I am not worried about the stock price going too far down. I can't see $WISH realistically going much below where it is right now."
2021-07-02 13:57:34,wallstreetbets,I sold amc options for like $18 strike that I bought for $10/share. They hit 70 that week lmao
2021-07-02 15:15:45,wallstreetbets,I like how your 'worst case scenario' is that the stock moons and not bag-holding forever.
2021-07-02 15:28:26,wallstreetbets,"I think like other dude said, his worst case scenario is if it goes to 25-30, but crashes back to 12 before expiry. Unless he could close his position and sell the shares? Idk how that works to be honest"

2021-07-02 17:11:13,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! July 9
2021-07-02 14:44:45,wallstreetbets,If the stock goes to 18 and back to 12 within expiry period then you missed out on selling at 18.

2021-07-02 18:01:44,wallstreetbets,I think $20 is the highest price we get until september and this year we won‚Äòt break the ATH in my Opinion but his technical analysis is not nonsense at all. The data is good but after the 5th it won‚Äòt hit the ATH that soon.

2021-07-02 17:51:33,wallstreetbets,Analysts all set a higher price target for CLNE than what it currently trades at. That just doesn't happen on other alleged P&D's. Go look it up
2021-07-02 16:22:16,wallstreetbets,I need that ice for my sore ass. I got shares at 10.85$
2021-07-02 13:02:53,wallstreetbets,Positions?
2021-07-02 15:14:50,wallstreetbets,Yeah wee'll see... CLNE so far has been the stock market equivalent to the Great Disappointment. I'm sure as fuck not climbing my roof this week waiting for it to Moon shot. I'll only climb my roof if the stock fucking tanks. Still holding though.
2021-07-02 17:08:44,wallstreetbets,Hopefully. My 7/16 calls have lost over half their value so far hahahahaha

2021-07-02 15:20:57,wallstreetbets,Heard this before. CLNE is cat shit wrapped in dog shit.

2021-07-02 12:56:08,wallstreetbets,It is only up about 40% this month.
2021-07-02 16:12:19,wallstreetbets,Who was long the stock and didn't think they were going to have a space flight at one point?
2021-07-02 13:05:35,wallstreetbets,News is great but if the flight fails it will go to 15. Successful and it will hit 75
2021-07-02 14:53:55,wallstreetbets,"Buy the rumor sell the news, you're to late my friend"
2021-07-02 13:00:52,wallstreetbets,"Its mainly because of the risk of failing at launch. If they succeed ull see growth again, might 2x. If not, itll go lower.

Edit :Risk*"
2021-07-02 12:58:53,wallstreetbets,"The success was expected and thus priced in already. Instead the catalyst was just used as a pump and dump opportunity.

Basically, you don't get bonus points for doing what you're supposed to do... Now if you fall short... That's another story üòâ"
2021-07-02 13:10:17,wallstreetbets,"Ya its people taking profits in anticipation for the launch to fail, and shorts capitalizing on that, IMO. I jumped in today around 48 .... seeing as a potential momentum reversal.  . eating a solid loss rn but holding thru next week expecting this to revist some previous highs.
In the stocks defense, it was already pretty extended."
2021-07-02 12:56:20,wallstreetbets,"I think the idea behind them is really cool. But at the end of the day‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs their purpose? You gonna pay $250,000 to go into orbit for a couple minutes?"
2021-07-02 13:06:54,wallstreetbets,"Same thing will happen when they have their first successful launch.

It's not going to stick until they can make it profitable."

2021-07-02 13:28:25,wallstreetbets,"Two things:

The risk is insane. It's spaceflight, so much can go wrong. This probably adds uncertainty for a lot of investors. Brandson going on the first flight also adds a lot more uncertainty and a huge risk to the company overall.

What's the end product if they achieve all their goals? Spaceflight for the super rich. I mean  yeah it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars per flight but there still inherent risks involved in spaceflight, just becuase you're rich doesn't mean you'll want to risk your life for a few mins of being in space. I haven't looked it up but what are the profit margins for each trip?"
2021-07-02 13:45:13,wallstreetbets,17 to 55 in a few weeks wasn‚Äôt enough for you?
2021-07-02 13:30:50,wallstreetbets,"I still think the pump and dump back in February plays a role in what's happening here, both with the FAA approval and with yesterday's announcement.

2021-07-02 17:07:53,wallstreetbets,"Anybody with half a clue already knew Branson was going to be on a flight this month. Last night's news was nothing new whatsoever. The real shock is that it went up $11 a share because of an ""announcement"" that was already public information."
2021-07-02 14:43:05,wallstreetbets,It went up after hours. Came back to reality during market hours. What are u missing ? People taking profits ...
2021-07-02 14:43:30,wallstreetbets,Puts on SPCE explosion
2021-07-02 14:09:39,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs people piling into Astra. Yesterday Astra wasn‚Äôt accessible to a majority of European investors because of brokerage issues as well as a large chunk of US. So that shit went crazy today and stole their thunder‚Ä¶‚Ä¶That and profit takers
2021-07-02 12:57:49,wallstreetbets,"But most of that was on speculation. It lost massive gains after each massive catalysts. Both FAA approval and SRB announcement had massive volume and gains, followed by a massive selloff."
2021-07-02 16:27:55,wallstreetbets,Depends on how many astronauts die in the failure.
2021-07-02 17:00:47,wallstreetbets,Spce has never sold the news. It's always ran up on news.
2021-07-02 13:24:01,wallstreetbets,Your genius is showing
2021-07-02 17:07:03,wallstreetbets,"I don't believe that. I think it was share dilution mostly, which should actually help the stock next week. Historically spce has always had a big run up on news, the selling in case of failure comes the Friday right before launch. There's still plenty of time before launch, people did not need to sell this early. It's also a 3 day holiday weekend so I'm sure people just wanted to take profits off AH gap up."
2021-07-02 13:15:24,wallstreetbets,"Government contracts, flying other countries to space, and taking people with money to space for the first time in human civilization. They've already got contracts with NASA."
2021-07-02 13:33:55,wallstreetbets,"Who's to say the price will always be at least $250k? Like most new tech, I have no doubt the price will decrease over time. Supply and demand ultimately rules all."
2021-07-02 13:18:16,wallstreetbets,A lot of people. $250k is nothing.
2021-07-02 14:19:02,wallstreetbets,"I think its around 250k to replace the engine, so the margins are pretty good. 

Right now it's just suborbital spaceflights but this is laying the groundwork to build a larger fleet, more spaceports, purchase planes from Boom Supersonic, develop their own hypersonic jet with Rolls Royce. They are beginning to establish their brand and reputation for safety. They are setting up to be a major player for an industry that doesn't exist yet."
2021-07-02 17:09:42,wallstreetbets,This guy's comment was a ploy to spread a virus to your computer. Nobody trust him.
2021-07-02 13:27:48,wallstreetbets,"Yeah people fucking speculated on stuff like this good news that happened, the price already reflected it lol"
2021-07-02 18:28:22,wallstreetbets,"No need to sell this early unless you woke up 20% up on your position overnight and decided that was good enough...  haha. the gap up just provided an exit opportunity for those ppl. 

In regards to dilution, did Virgin say anything about diluting shareholders today? I honeslty don't even know if companies are required to inform the public before diluting shares..

Edit : I agree to some degree though. I don't think a long weekend warrants an 8 dollar move by itself, but I do think that played a role in the general redness of today"
2021-07-02 13:30:40,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve just got far more faith in SpaceX for the long run.
2021-07-02 13:51:47,wallstreetbets,That applies to everything.
2021-07-02 13:55:55,wallstreetbets,"Now what percentage of them, want to go up on a space plain. Your customer base starts looking very small very quickly. And even the slightest hiccup, a hard landing etc. Let alone an actual crash, is instantly out of business."
2021-07-02 14:00:02,wallstreetbets,I beg to differ. We fly people in planes all the time. Its just a higher altitude. There are lots of billionaires out there who wipe their asses with 250k.
2021-07-02 14:45:47,wallstreetbets,"It's not just sending rich folks to space, it's all the IP created along the way."
2021-07-02 14:07:02,wallstreetbets,There are 614 billionaires in the US. If 1% of them want to fly to space. Thats 6 customers. If 1% percent of those 6 want to go more than once. Thats .06 repeat customers.
2021-07-02 14:49:55,wallstreetbets,"In the US. This is a global company. 
I doubt 1% is even comparable. Im going to say at least 40% of these billionaires will try it at least once. 

Not even to mention all the millionaires who are going to pay the ticket because they can. 

Also of those millionaires theyre will be the influencer types who will take the trip as a means of acquiring more views. 

If youre sleeping on SPCE thats on you."
2021-07-02 15:03:46,wallstreetbets,Its a global company ? How many planes do they have ? How many airports do they operate from ? How many countries are they licensed in ? And 40% holy shit thats optimistic. SPCE doesn't interest me at all as an investment. Maybe to short.

2021-07-02 12:37:18,wallstreetbets,I am ready for a ramen-filled month
2021-07-02 13:19:56,wallstreetbets,You don't think Reverse Repo hitting $990b is bearish?
2021-07-02 13:47:36,wallstreetbets,Why would it be bearish? Its neither bearish or bullish for the markets imo
2021-07-02 13:53:48,wallstreetbets,RR indicates that institutions are parking liquidity for some unknown reason. Why else would there be record high overnight liquidity if not to meet margin requirements?
2021-07-02 14:01:32,wallstreetbets,Banks arent lending right now is the main reason imo. Nothing to do with margin requirements
2021-07-02 14:19:59,wallstreetbets,"Why would banks stop lending? Once again, seems bearish to me (at least in the short term). Ending of lending programs seems to imply they are preparing for something and keeping their money close."
2021-07-02 16:13:12,wallstreetbets,Because interest rates are low and there‚Äôs not a lot of good collateral that‚Äôs unencumbered. This is completely expected as the economy reopens

2021-07-02 12:56:43,wallstreetbets,Time to try the opposite and see how that works out
2021-07-02 17:36:35,wallstreetbets,"Owned Box for awhile and bought during the teens and then just holding it forever. I'll be interested to see if it spikes or gets bought out depending on what they plan to do with it.

I'd hate to miss out on the gains but being handed over 30+ a share in a takeover isn't the worst way for your investment to end."
2021-07-02 14:59:59,wallstreetbets,"Bought at 18. Sold at 24. I didn't want to sell. Hadbto decrease the leverage in my portfolio and box is the one that has to go. Box has a takeover rumor, activist investor is in there to make the sale happens. Most likely, it will be sold at a valuation above or around 30$.
Good luck brother!"

2021-07-02 12:16:52,wallstreetbets,"Great, it will go down even more"
2021-07-02 13:56:36,wallstreetbets,Sounds like basic  cloud solutions/sales engineer interface.
2021-07-02 13:02:33,wallstreetbets,I'd imagine they view Microsoft a natural partner since they were chosen for the military cloud contract.
2021-07-02 16:09:47,wallstreetbets,"They could disclose a black holes space travel partnership with the, now apparently real, aliens and still go -2%"
2021-07-02 13:18:22,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs going to be big news when official
2021-07-02 17:36:52,wallstreetbets,"This is not really news because this is how MS is attracting people to Azure.

They say ""Move all your stuff to Azure and we'll help sell your product"".

It sounds extremely enticing at first glance but moving to MS' azure platform is non-trivial. They reinvented a lot of wheels and even standard shit like an object store they had to fuck with and change the way it works.

I typed all that without even looking at the post and then confirmed it from the job listing with this:

""....and consumption of Foundry on Azure."""
2021-07-02 15:33:35,wallstreetbets,Palantir has a contract with airbus and they are using it with their A220 program for maintenance data...I saw on a job posting. The A220 program is going to be so succesful post covid era and basically now.
2021-07-02 18:24:52,wallstreetbets,This is a great move - it will open up Palantir to lots more customers in the corporate space.
2021-07-02 14:40:03,wallstreetbets,How much you think this jobs paying?

2021-07-02 12:44:23,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, 

Bad news -10%

2021-07-02 15:48:54,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, ‚Äúgood‚Äù news is bad. We need news to break that the CEO was caught last weekend participating in an all you can eat banana feasting competition at a controversial local festival spreading awareness for Planet of the Apes 3: The Return of the Apes

2021-07-02 15:53:50,wallstreetbets,"Don't disturb the retards with your facts please.

Next think you're going to tell me is that Palantir doesn't have deals with Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon and they are just listing react, vscode, and aws in job ad."
2021-07-02 14:19:32,wallstreetbets,So -10%? Lol
2021-07-02 14:57:01,wallstreetbets,You pay the job you mean

2021-07-02 15:41:58,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll ever go to -100%. Someone will buy it back for 1c. ü•≥

2021-07-02 14:16:11,wallstreetbets,No news +40% in 4 weeks
2021-07-02 16:50:38,wallstreetbets,Lol. Totally
2021-07-02 15:53:38,wallstreetbets,But the fundamentals are becoming better and the high valuation is becoming more and more justifiable. Bullish long term.
2021-07-02 16:07:50,wallstreetbets,"Oh yes you are so smart lmao. A quick google search would have given you partneships with AWS and IBM. Not sure you can read but here you go:

Many institutions are moving to cloud and Azure is among the leaders. If Foundry will be available as a service on it, many organizations will use it. Google cloud to follow."
2021-07-02 14:30:58,wallstreetbets,"\-20% 

This is going to be big news, so it'll move bigly too."

2021-07-02 16:32:12,wallstreetbets,"If the google playstore engineers work together with you to oprimise, offer and sell the app to the customers - probably not dishonest."

‚ÄúIt was also found that Covaxin demonstrated 100% efficacy against severe Covid-19.

In that regard, obviously you can‚Äôt do any better than that result. It‚Äôs not every day that you hear ‚Äú100% efficacy‚Äù mentioned in a clinical trial context.

Plus, there‚Äôs something else. Evidently, Covaxin was found to have 70% efficacy against asymptomatic infections. This is significant as it tends to suggest that Covaxin prevents transmissions.‚Äù

2021-07-02 17:01:47,wallstreetbets,I don't have much hope for wish .In general the company is pretty trash.  Hopefully you guys can make some money though. I didn't even know wish was shorted.
2021-07-02 15:29:32,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre right man, seriously that company sucks."
2021-07-02 17:05:31,wallstreetbets,I mean this sub is about making money not the environment. My take is that wish is shit and no one uses it but apparently it's being shorted so that's why people are buying.
2021-07-02 14:08:42,wallstreetbets,"I don't know why you are being downvoted. The company is literal shit that sells the lowest trash-tier Chinese garbage you can find.

Just because these people bought into this pump and dump doesn't change the reality of this horrible company.

Bagholding for all the millionaires who dumped this on you doesn't make you a diamond handed Chad. It makes you a stubborn moron who can't admit when they have been swindled."

2021-07-02 15:27:58,wallstreetbets,"I tried to post that WISH sucks and it got removed, so I bought 100 shares and posted it as a YOLO, removed - automod said 100 shares isn‚Äôt yolo. So then I bought 1000 shares and posted a screen shot with a nice long title about it sucking. REMOVED. Who do they think they‚Äôre kidding. Not me! No one cares about that shit failing company selling cheap China crap. This sub has been compromised!"
2021-07-02 19:27:31,wallstreetbets,You can all in your net worth on the shares. This is still YOLO.

2021-07-02 17:38:28,wallstreetbets,There numbers are actually pretty sound as far as growth.  But yah they do sell trashy shit.
2021-07-02 17:09:50,wallstreetbets,Why do you think it's trash? You just don't like it?
2021-07-02 17:31:21,wallstreetbets,"Alot of these wish and clov posts are fake. And the rest are suckers who are angry bag holders. If you don‚Äôt learn from getting burned you aren‚Äôt gonna do well. I‚Äôve been burned a shady company that rhymes with baronis buels comes to mind. I just picked them and bought without any DD , had i done my due diligence I would have found the blaring inconsistencies of two companys with very similar tickers and almost identical names having the same ceo listed in two different states with two different addresses .

People that bought wish didn‚Äôt do research either they were emotionally manipulated by internet hype into buying the peak before the dump. If they did research they would see the company sucks it isnt worth shit and certain funds held most of the shares. When the price went up these funds dumped their shares made massive profit and left retail holding the empty bags.

Alot of these wish people got scammed and now they are just being petulant and mad about it."
2021-07-02 14:36:08,wallstreetbets,Literally Chinese garbage destroying the environment. People are fucking trashy! No shame.
2021-07-02 17:12:21,wallstreetbets,"Oh look, another ""MOdS comPromISeD"" from someone who can't fucking read ‡≤†_‡≤†

You bought 100 shares and it was never a yolo, or a meme, or a discussion. It was automatically removed a few times because you did it wrong over and over and over again."
2021-07-02 17:43:41,wallstreetbets,They have a class action lawsuit against them lol I'll keep watch and if people start making some money maybe I'll jump in but I'm skeptical.
2021-07-02 17:12:20,wallstreetbets,This company is known for bad products . With that kind of reputation it doesn't seem like a company worth betting on. If you want to invest in e commerce and one that's shorted try EXPR.
2021-07-02 15:28:57,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs being downvoted because this whole sub is full of hedge funded hackers. It‚Äôs all bullshit. Read my comment above.
2021-07-02 17:21:00,wallstreetbets,Are you holdin any wish by chance? Im guessin you are and I bet you bought at the top of the pump like a true retard. Enjoy your bags.
2021-07-02 18:22:32,wallstreetbets,"It was a discussion, just about how much WISH sucks and that doesn‚Äôt fit their agenda."
2021-07-02 17:53:51,wallstreetbets,Pick smart entry points. Consolidation needs to happen. Just my .02. I‚Äôm bag holding.

2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Do you like food and water? Then AppHarvest is for you. Food grown with 90% less water, all rainwater, AI, robots, 30x yields, year round, in center of US. AppHarvest (APPH) hits on so many levels, it's almost hard to grasp it all.

**Efficiency:** We are all quickly running out of fresh water, and the vast majority of water goes to farms. AppHarvest builds and operates vertical indoor farms that run at peak efficiency to yield 30x more crops per acre than traditional farms, using 90% less water, and ALL of their water is collected rainwater, meaning they are not taking ANY water away from the households around them, and they use 30x less land than traditional farms.

**Organic:** They need no pesticides since they control their whole environment. They even keep their own bees for pollenation. And thanks to the aforementioned efficiency, AppHarvest organic produce is priced very competitively with the standard stuff. Standard farmed produce will only get more expensive as farms fail, while AppHarvest costs will keep going down.

**Tech:** AppHarvest has recently acquired RootAI, which they use to control the environment, monitor the produce, and adjust for peak outcome. They have kept the RootAI team intact and will keep developing the AI for even further efficiency gains, and possibly licensing to other companies or even governments globally for an additional revenue stream.

**Location:** They are in eastern Kentucky (Appalachia), where rainfall is actually increasing each year, while the West has almost no water remaining. Soil is seriously degrading in the Midwest. AppHarvest is within a day's drive of 70% of the US, meaning fruits and vegetables they send out are fresher when they arrive in store, pollute less on the way there, and will also contribute to the US economy by replacing the currently huge and growing produce imports from mainly Mexico but also the rest of Central and South America.

**Distribution:** Major distributor Mastronardi and AppHarvest have a 10 year contract. You can read the whole thing in SEC filings. Mastronardi is already sending APPH tomatoes to Walmart, Kroger, etc. and they have said that they easily, immediately sell every tomato APPH grows, and they can't wait for more. AppHarvest is free to focus on the produce.

**Growth:** APPH just broke ground on farms 4 and 5. They plan to have 12 indoor farms running by 2025, and so far, they're ahead of schedule. First facility (up and running) is all tomatoes. By next year, they'll be sending out leafy greens and berries from the farms now being built. They also thought ahead and locked in the pricing for all the steel and glass they will need before covid hit and jacked up supply chains and thus commodity prices!

**Jobs:** APPH pays a living wage, with full benefits and stock options, and is hugely popular in Kentucky, getting thousands of applications per job opening, government subsidies for creating jobs in Appalachia, and politicians from local to governors and senators smiling at their events and praising them on Twitter. APPH is one of the few companies truly doing Env/Soc/Gov and they are a certified B corp.

**Leadership:** CEO Jonathan Webb used to work on EV contracts for DoD before he went home to Kentucky to start AppHarvest. In his interviews you can see he's extremely knowledgeable about putting all the pieces together to actually get results. President David Lee used to work at Impossible Foods and Del Monte, very connected guy. Board includes Martha Stewart and Jeff Ubben, a major Env/Soc/Gov investor.

**Stock price:** It's cheap! Currently about 50% off its all time high, APPH stock took a dive along with all the other de-SPACced companies in late February. There is quite a bit of shorting, very few shares available to short and borrow fee around 10%. It often dips at open and then soars later in the day. I'm not here to say when these üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ will blast off, just that they have to eventually. Much easier to get in while it's cheap as hell than try to time the liftoff.

Hope I didn't forget anything - there's so damn much to love about this company!

2021-07-02 13:03:32,wallstreetbets,If that company fell another 50% I still wouldn't buy. The assets to price ratio is retardedly high for a farming company. You also don't understand greenhouse growing which makes it even harder to believe what you say.

seems like an asymmetric risk to me at this point.  The success/first big wig in space has already been priced in.  If the flight is a success, I'm not sure it pops a whole lot more.  If it doesn't go according to plan, then the share price will drop faster than the rocket.

Wait until SuperBowl next year and the name SOFI is said millions and millions of times because of the SuperBowl will be at the SoFi Stadium.

2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$MU beat earnings: why it‚Äôs going down. DD I was holding call positions on $MU through May-June like a good ape ü¶ç. Here‚Äôs why I switched to puts.  
  
DRAM won‚Äôt be in short supply for long and smart money knows it. This means the prices for DRAM (which make up 70% of $MU‚Äôs revenue) aren‚Äôt going to continue increasing. 
In fact‚Ä¶ they‚Äôll likely peak October then start dropping.  
  
**Reason #1:**  
Now my fellow apes may ask‚Ä¶ ‚Äúbut peaceinpieces, Bloomberg articles tell me semiconductors are in a huge shortage‚Äù. 
Sure that‚Äôs true as blanket statement, but let‚Äôs peal the eggplant üçÜ shall we?   
  
What‚Äôs holding up the production of PC, Mobile handset, and servers isn‚Äôt DRAM!
They‚Äôre short on everything else: semiconductors like display, analog power ICs, CPUs, Networking chips, etc.  
  
In fact many large customers have surplus DRAM (most notably mobile phone makers).
Why? Because they‚Äôve been buying DRAM while unable to get ahold of other necessary components.  
  
**Reason #2**  
Industry experts already knew earnings were going to be great. It‚Äôs been priced in since May.  
  
What they were looking for in the earnings call was for Micron to swing their big dick onto the table and proclaim: ‚ÄúDRAMs short in 2022 retards! We‚Äôre going to the moon üöÄ‚Äù.  
  
Instead they got lukewarm piss: ‚ÄúWe see DRAM ASPs increasing through 2H‚Äù.  
To which most analysts thought, ‚ÄúNo shit, holiday season bruh.‚Äù  
Micron showed no confidence.  
  
**TLDR: I spent my time typing, so go read you ape ü¶ç . This market insight is being provided as a public service.**  
  
**Side note, I‚Äôm still long $WDC and holding my calls and adding more for October. Pending KIOXIA‚Äôs IPO in Japan, $WDC is undervalued at $20B. **"

The company generates 3b in revenue while having a market cap of 200b. The growth rate during the pandemic was above 100%, but analyst have them growing at a more modest rate of 40-50% this year, and moving forward.

&#x200B;

On the weekly chart posted above, there is double top being created at 1500, and at the very top end of the Bollinger Band.

P/S chart over the years:

&#x200B;

[During the pandemic P\/S ratio went through the moon - currently at 53. It use be in the 20's.](https://preview.redd.it/oqfszdd2at871.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4d07ae48b04a788301c001d0eec569a02fe894d)

Growth rate estimate by analysts:

[2021 - 50&#37; growth expected. 2022 - 32&#37; growth rate](https://preview.redd.it/5nb4od7kat871.png?width=921&format=png&auto=webp&s=71dc73c769cf0483deb74ce17788bf2243f239ab)

Shopify grew at 100% rate during the pandemic. but most analyst estimate growth to slow down as we go back to our normal lives.

&#x200B;

I'm leaning toward next year1500 puts. I also belive this winter the FEDS will start tapering so the whole market will have a nice pull back, and these high flyers will come back to reality."

They're good at one thing. Small business Ecom, but that's it. For any large store they're too rigid and have too many issues. 

One really good aspect of their business is they do provide a pretty awesome checkout with like 20 payment processing options like stripe behind the covers. 

If you built your site yourself, on top of stripe alone, and stripe decides they don't like you or something. It's a TON of work to switch to a different provider. With Shopify you just choose the next one in the list.

I do feel like they're over valued, but they are really good  at a few things."

This article says that some group in New Mexico filed an anti-trust suit against a BUNCH of big Banks. If I'm understanding correctly, the claim is that they collaborated as a ""cartel"" to price credit default swaps and didn't actually allow the market to price them.

Why is Bloomberg Law the only outlet that's covered this even a little? This seems like it could be a huge deal down the road.

Is it just because a random group in NM brought the charges?"

2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"If $XLNX shares will be 1.723*$AMD with the merger.. why is it still undervalued? Since the merger is extremely likely to be going through soon, and XLNX will be converted into 1.723 AMD stock, I really don't understand why XLNX (currently $141) isn't already closer to AMD($93)*1.723 ($160)? That seems like a really large gap. Is it just in case China addendums the merger?

This is the first merge I've looked at except AppHarvest buying Novus, so I don't really know the typical trends in these incidences.
To me it looks like XLNX should be worth much closer to $160 than the current $141 price though. Am I an idiot for abandoning everything else and thinking Xilinx is surefire going to go up because of this?"

2021-07-02 11:25:07,wallstreetbets,"Dear OP, you‚Äôre not the first post about this arbitrage. Smart ones already started buying xlnx in anticipation of the merger. You‚Äôre absolutely right about xilinx being on a discount right now at 140. Getting 1.7 shares of amd for every xlnx share is like free money for those who buy xlnx at this level. I have 10 shares of xlnx and accumulating more over the next few weeks"
2021-07-02 10:34:57,wallstreetbets,Will AMD go up or down w merger?
2021-07-02 10:20:21,wallstreetbets,"Ultimately yes you are correct. The reason for the spread though is the risk involved if the merger doesn‚Äôt go through. While most hurdles have been passed I believe they still have China and the US to work through. It‚Äôll tighten up the closer to the merger it gets assuming the hurdles all get jumped. It‚Äôs also one of the reasons AMD isn‚Äôt popping as much. A lot of  arbiters will short the Buying Company and buy up the target. 

I have not shorted AMD, but I am in on XLNX. Might double my position as I think the risk is worth the it."
2021-07-02 10:58:54,wallstreetbets,"Wow, so that is pretty wild info!

With AMD popping off, if shorts get covered XLNX will boom?! I like the sound of this. Holding my XLNX for a while then :)

2021-07-02 10:41:33,wallstreetbets,"AMD and Xilinx should meet in the middle before the merger occurs, but AMD is so bullish lately that it seems like it won't be dropping and XLNX will be coming up instead.

Typically it seems, based on very rudimentary research, that both companies go up in general. So, if neither are likely to go down.. XLNX appears to be undervalued.

Maybe I'm missing something tho, I'd really like someone with more experience than me to comment on this whole thing."

2021-07-02 10:59:36,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll see if I can‚Äôt dig it up the article, but The gist was that no one believes the US is going to be a problem. It‚Äôs more of a formality filing of paperwork. Often on these M&As the US and Europe can be the last to sign off just because the process is so complicated and thorough. The Tiffany sale is a good example. They started with EU first and that was the last to clear.

That being said, the spread is pretty wide given this looks pretty good to go through. Seems like a no brainer pick up to me both short and long."
2021-07-02 11:14:27,wallstreetbets,"Awesome, thank you for the happy vibe confirmation bias. Makes me very excited! Haha

I read it's typically a <10% spread, so XLNX should still be above $147 anyway. Especially since like you mentioned and everything I read seem to suggest there's no expected problems on this one."
2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$BARK at the MOON!  Listen up, we‚Äôre about to talk about something that‚Äôs kind of lame but actually low key cool as fuck. Buckle in because we‚Äôre about to talk about a ...dog toy company.

$CHEWY.... Ahem I mean $BARK...yeah $BARK. At first glance you might say...why? I‚Äôm going to tell you why, calm down. First I‚Äôm going to tell you a little bit about what this company does. This is a subscription service that will send you a new box of dog toys and treats every month. There are a couple different types of boxes/subscription services available. So, naturally,¬† I'm going to exhaust myself listing them all out below.

* **The original Barkbox**: This box contains different toys/treats with new ones sent each month. This would be their most pupular (heh heh) product. The subscription service offered for this product benefits those who choose longer subscriptions. Here are some prices:  

   * 12 months for $23 a month ($276 a year)
   * 6 months for $26 month ($312 a year)
   * 1 month for $35 ($420 a year bruh)

* **The Superchewer Box**: This box is the same idea of different toys/treats delivered monthly. The difference is that this box contains more durable toys for larger breeds or more active dogs. The prices of this product below:  

   * 12 months: $30/box
   * 6 month: $35/box
   * 1 month: $45/box

* As you can see this box is geared towards dogs with dental problems. It‚Äôs a niche market, and as an owner of a pug with literally no teeth I could tell you this market is quite open at this point in time.
* This is priced at $30 a month on their website
* **Bark Eats** \- as the name implies (if you can read) this is a dog food subscription. This is a service that is personalized to your specific dogs and their diet needs.¬†
* Prices for this (based on a 40 pound dog) run from $30-$60 a month. They can potentially run more depending on diet needs.

Alright so now that we've gotten that out of the way, let‚Äôs talk about why I think this matters. Afterwards I might even throw some numbers and charts your way. (Numbers are kind of like letters except they represent ‚Äúamounts‚Äù of something)

Pet ownership is a huge industry. In 2019 the global petcare industry grew to $120 billion, and spending in the US alone rose up to 50 billion dollars. In 2020 the global market has risen to 207.90 billion and 70.66 billion in the US alone. This shows a CAGR (Camping Around Gay Rabbits) rate of 5.6%. With the petcare industry growing at this rate, why wouldn‚Äôt there be a need to rope people into a monthly subscription of chew toys and snacks for their 3 year old lhasa opso that only barks at black people?'

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n2uzsry41t871.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=c93e2cf4fa4e1b6f76d04e257040c288ab98cca3

**SPAC Merger**

We gotta talk about this boring shit really quick because its actually important, and the reason why we‚Äôre able to talk about this stock today.

On 17 December 2020, BARK signed a definitive agreement to merge with Northern Star Acquisition Corp. (STIC), a SPAC led by Joanna Coles formerly editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan Magazine. (her head shot photo is the most intense thing I‚Äôve ever witnessed) She is also a board member in reddit meme favorite Snap (SNAP) and admittedly boring Sonos (SONO). Post merger the company began trading under $bark.¬†

From Seeking Alpha‚Äôs article: Barkbox: Barking up the right tree : ‚ÄúThis merger gave $Bark $454 million of gross cash proceeds, which includes $354 million from STIC‚Äôs cash held in trust and a $200 million PIPE deal led by Fidelity, Senator Investment Group, the Federated Hermes Kaufmann Funds, and affiliates of the Santo Domingo Group. ‚Äú

Essentially what we are looking at here is an influx of cash to the company to expand their presence and build more business.

**Company Highlights**

So, what this company does really well is their marketing and distribution. This helped them reach 1.1 million active monthly subscriptions and a super high monthly retention rate of 94.4%. They also have a huge social media presence, with 8.5 million followers.

For matter of comparison, and because I want to point out what this random fucking dog toy company is doing better than it‚Äôs competitors.

*Chewy has 695k followers*

*Petco has 650k followers*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3v1b4xt61t871.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=d86ca267e2aaf0c0c881c69bb31d9f6e5e251ec7

Bark has made some ridiculous strides over the past few years. In 2014 the company went from 80,000 subscribers to a barking 663k subscribers in 2020. Now just over the past year subscriber count has risen 58%, or from 663k subscribers to over 1M subscribers. This accelerated growth is attributed to an extreme bump in pet ownership due to covid.

A recent management presentation available on chewy‚Äôs website show an expectation of growth from $224M in revenue for FY2020 to $706M in revenue in 2023.¬†

**Wait, more financials.** 

So I must mention that this company is not currently turning a profit. Bark is currently focused on throwing a ton of money back into their marketing as well as r&d. This is also due to the high cost related to barks current focus on third party retailers (this helps get their name out there more, but is costly). So basically this company is throwing a bunch of money into roping Becky‚Äôs across the world¬† into coughing up their daddy‚Äôs credit card info and getting locked into a 12 month subscription of...dog toys.

**A profit and loss chart from seeking alpha below:**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lmeteit81t871.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=24e1debe335145d59b106840b7642ff039e1ce5e

As we can see here, for the next few years this company expects to throw a fuckton of money into their marketing. The goal behind this is to grow the business exponentially. For 2024 and beyond, operating margins are expected to decrease. Gross profit per customer has gone up annually, while their customer acquisition costs have decreased.

>Simply put, this happens when a company‚Äôs expenses exceed its profits. The >solution? There‚Äôs a few viable ones, but for BarkBox. The answer was to go >public.

Let's take a look at some pictures of lines

When Bark first went public in December of 2020, the stock opened at $12.40. Over the next few days it saw a 50% rise to $19.54. Since then it has experienced a subsequent drop of around 50% again, where it is currently trading in the $10-$11 range.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9eglacfb1t871.png?width=1341&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebcdb22333db7e2d700ea5c65d69761ab11b5e96

So, what does this mean going forward? I don't fucking know I'm not a wizard. I did once go on the Harry Potter ride at universal studios though. So, for myself I see a good opportunity for entry at this price. Let's take a look at a similar company.

Chewy is another dog toy related company that just began turning a profit in the fourth quarter of 2020. They became a public company on June 14 of 2019. Also note chewy does not offer a subscription services at this time.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q15j9rhc1t871.png?width=1369&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb87e9e2c76f017ea984aeaa4813820898d4b8f1

As we can see, this stock has essentially gone nuts over the past year. Previous to reporting a profitable quarter in march of 2020, the stock typically traded within the $20-$30 range. From the results of the company's positive 4th quarter of 2020 earnings report the stock then saw a 356% run up to a share price of $118.69.

**So yea, chewy, great. Good for you. Nobody's going to argue that your stock is beast.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o738b5hd1t871.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=145e8778d14e69e1b42ad75a8130b3e5e3e8eb6d

Why am I using this comparison? I just want to point out how big of a **bone** the market has for a pet company (especially one beginning to turn a profit). Can bark follow in these footsteps? *It absolutely can.* It will require the company to continue sinking its teeth into new markets (which is exactly what they are doing). Personally, I remain bullish on this company. Do I expect a 355% run up this year? Well id really fucking like it if it did, but I'm OK with seeing this stock inch up to the $20-$30 range (as seen with chewy while they remained an unprofitable company).

What do I think is going to drive this stock price up right now?

Over the past month this company has received several buy ratings. On June 28, a Citigroup analyst hit the company with a buy rating. On June 10 and 14 both Jefferies and Canaccord Genuity hit this shit with a buy rating as well. So now the company is 3 for 3 on buy ratings. Pretty cool if you ask me. It can be the start of a bullish upward trend for this stock over the next few weeks/months.

As a result we've seen the stock seemingly bounce off of support in the $10 range over the past few days. While Thursday we did see a red day for the company, the stock still sit's at higher than seen earlier this month.

Anyway, that's all I got. I like this stock and I feel its value in my plums. This is not financial advice, just a brief analysis on some things I like about this company.

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Company with great management backing them goes public, sees an initial rise in stock price followed by a subsequent fall to support where we stand today. Comparable companies show that this could be a profitable company and a worthy investment.**

Very early to tell with BARK but with solid leadership they may be able to make breakthroughs to a niche customer base and gain market share ‚Äî and that I can get behind"
2021-07-02 12:32:58,wallstreetbets,Good DD but food vs toys?  Ones a necessity the other are vanity play items.
2021-07-02 11:00:57,wallstreetbets,"First, the comments in this thread are sketchy to me. Not to mention the number of awards given in less than an hour compared to the number of comments. 

Solid info but some questions. Disclosure: I was in STIC for a while when SIR_JACKS_ALOT or whatever his username is decided to use it for a pump and dump basically. 

They have 1.1 million subscribers for a 94.4% retention based on your DD. What is the average subscription length? How is retention calculated here? What is their retention for a 6-month box? What about a 12-month?

What do you think they can do better than Chewy? Chewy has Goody Boxes, and while not technically a subscription, you can do auto-delivery and pick your own timeframe, not just monthly. What does BarkBox offer currently that Chewy doesn't/won't be able to? 

Not saying there isn't a play here but if there is it's longer term. And if they're just going to pump money in marketing I imagine it will be difficult to outcompete Chewy and offer competitive prices. Just my thoughts though! Curious to hear yours."

I think this kind of thing is definitely the future. I know someone who orders all their meals through a delivery service.
2021-07-02 14:02:15,wallstreetbets,Bark is a brand. Chewy is a store. It‚Äôs like Nike v footlocker.

Neither are iPhones. 

Neither are children. 


But often when you have a pet you sure as hell want to spoil them. Most people who have pets treat them like their kids, and a lot more people are opting for pets in lieu of kids with global rising prices in cost of living."
2021-07-02 12:15:23,wallstreetbets,"Your questions lead up to a statement, so this whole thing really reads like a thesis or a bear case.  Your bearcase seems to be that chewy is nimble enough to come up with a competing product in time to ruin a short play but that this is a long play. There seems to be a logical disconnect in it."
2021-07-02 15:59:29,wallstreetbets,"One of you guys was already banned lol, do you have a bear case?"

2021-07-02 15:18:34,wallstreetbets,You are absolutely correct.  I was off base could to think that food was more important than chew toys.  My apologies
2021-07-02 13:03:03,wallstreetbets,"Chewy already has Goody Boxes, they don't need to come up with a competing product. It exists already. 

The only thing BarkBox does that Chewy doesn't is the personalized dog food. I imagine Chewy could replicate that much easier than BarkBox can replicate everything Chewy does. What catalysts are there to expect BARK to jump to $20-30 anytime soon?"

2021-07-02 11:25:33,wallstreetbets,Yea I‚Äôm mainly looking for confirmation from people on SEEL I saw it in Tesla and AMC comments. I bought some purely to hold long on. I was in bark and woof lil while back too.
2021-07-02 10:20:12,wallstreetbets,There is no doubt some kind of packaging revolution on the way that it would be silly to think that would prohibit this centralized business model from taking over all markets and industries that ship items under a certain size.
2021-07-02 15:29:55,wallstreetbets,"Everything chewy does is just software and operators, that's the point of the disruption models: almost anyone can start it up. You say they can't copy chewy and they already are and doing it better."
2021-07-02 11:26:35,wallstreetbets,Okay dude. idk why you would post this comment on a BARK DD though. Try the daily thread.

2021-07-02 11:22:31,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs hard to call out a true bottom though. Severely undervalued and trading around a 20 P/E ratio which is incredibly cheap. CCP bashing it left and right doesn‚Äôt help much nor does the news of banning Chinese stocks in NYSE. It may even go below $200 if the entire market goes into correction but again hard to call out a bottom IMO

**Some pea-brain gamers in the chat, we're looking at exchange volume of assets, not $COIN shares.**

  
As part of on-going updates related to [my USD-volume analysis of coinbase](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mua3vo/coinbase_the_volume_dd/), Q2 is a wrap.

* **Q2 Average Daily Volume rose +28% over Q1**. Assuming this is a strong approximate of coinbase's total revenue streams:
* $2.30 Billion Revenue, \~$1.30 Billion Profit (assumes $1 bill operational costs, per Q1)
* The tail end of Q2 witnessed trading reduction back to Q1-like levels

# Forecasts:

* Below are some loose approximations on trading volume QoQ. I'm guessing Q3 will be tepid and likely Q1-ish ($1.8 rev, $0.8 rev)
* If you treat each case equally, **price target falls in the $350-$500 range**

# Beyond Trading Volume

* Staking continues to grow and expand within the community
* Coinbase launches in Japan and Germany. The company is Germany's first licensed exchange
* Coinbase prepares to launch Lend, providing 4% APY on USDC. This will attract new users in droves, as well as incentivize existing users to be cash-ready for engaging in investing + trading"

2021-07-02 10:02:51,wallstreetbets,Only a matter of time before China steals all of teslas tech and starts making them knockoffs
2021-07-02 10:09:30,wallstreetbets,Interesting that there seems to be not much demand for Model S/X anymore. Not good for margins
2021-07-02 10:14:47,wallstreetbets,It only goes up anyway
2021-07-02 10:31:15,wallstreetbets,Nice model 3?
2021-07-02 10:18:10,wallstreetbets,"Elon has talked about the importance of continued rapid pace of innovation.

Part of the reason for that is that rapid innovation protects you against would be copy cats. So if Tesla continues to innovate and optimize at a quick pace, then copy cats have no chance of ever really competing with Tesla."
2021-07-02 11:18:52,wallstreetbets,"Well, they really need to be able to copy the machine that makes the part. But those machines are very expensive, are the biggest high pressure casting machines in the world, and are made in Italy. 

3 of these ‚Äúgiga presses‚Äù are installed in Shanghai. 

So do the Chinese have access to them? I don‚Äôt know. Maybe they could sneak in there and see how it works. 

But it would take them years and years of work to reproduce these presses. The Chinese are great at copying. But they‚Äôre not fast. We put our first Mars rover on the planet in 1997. Then we put 4 more on Mars, each better than the last. Only in 2021 did China catch up with their own rover. 

Finally, I went to college with a Chinese roommate, an aerospace engineer that worked on their lunar lander program. 

He was obsessed with video games and while smart‚Ä¶ he wasn‚Äôt *that* smart. He was just a normal, introverted, dude. I‚Äôve met many American college students much smarter. 

The Chinese are doing great in manufacturing. But their quality is only like ‚Ä¶ Chevrolet level. Not Toyota level. Not even Tesla level."
2021-07-02 15:01:30,wallstreetbets,"Apple had a head start with iPhone and I guarantee you if you talk to anyone in China , apple is still the de facto luxury brand. At least no one is opting to buy an uPear instead of the apple. 

The presence of knockoffs doesn‚Äôt make a conglomerate like LVMH any less profits. 

The people who buy knockoff LV bags are never customers that could‚Äôve afford an LV anyways."
2021-07-02 14:54:00,wallstreetbets,Same thing was said about Apple phones. You can steal all the parts but you don‚Äôt get the whole.
2021-07-02 10:03:15,wallstreetbets,Aka NIO?
2021-07-02 10:45:19,wallstreetbets,Sales of S and X were low because they literally had shutdown those production lines for most of the quarter to get ready for the new versions. Has nothing to do with demand
2021-07-02 10:43:40,wallstreetbets,Are they not sold out?
2021-07-02 10:32:02,wallstreetbets,Wow! Never thought of it like that. Innovation in space during the 60-70's did help out a lot. Good stuff!
2021-07-02 17:44:22,wallstreetbets,">Elon has talked about the importance of continued rapid pace of innovation.

its cool that he talks about this but then again the model 3 and model Y are their only large volume vehicles and have been for many years now and the model Y is not even available globally yet.

If by fast paced he means as fast as basically all other car companies he seems right on schedule."
2021-07-02 11:37:32,wallstreetbets,Well any company in China that has 15 or more employees they have to have someone from the CCP party employed there
2021-07-02 17:46:50,wallstreetbets,">Well, they really need to be able to copy the machine that makes the part. But those machines are very expensive, are the biggest high pressure casting machines in the world, and are made in Italy.

the thing is nobody really needs these machines unless you intent to build a 1 to 1 copy.

These casting machines solved a problem that Tesla had with the read end of their vehicles as they had a very complicated design with many small welded parts.

The thing is others dont have this problem cause they know how to make these parts for decades now so there is no need for anyone to make castings of this size."
2021-07-02 12:19:18,wallstreetbets,Lets go Nio
2021-07-02 10:46:02,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt follow Tesla that closely, but my interpretation was that they shifted almost all production to model 3/Y because demand for the others isn‚Äôt there"
2021-07-02 10:55:34,wallstreetbets,"The space analogy also works really well considering the current competitive landscape in the space industry. There you have SpaceX already landing and re-using their Falcon 9 rockets for half a decade at this point, with no one close to having a competitive answer for that. Space however is still blazing ahead and developing their Starship at breakneck speed despite having no competitors for several years to come.

So by the time someone manages to make a rocket that can be competitive with the falcon 9 in terms of capacity and cost, SpaceX will still be many years ahead of would be competitors"
2021-07-02 19:54:53,wallstreetbets,"Ah no other company makes EV's with the same margins, or even with engines as efficient as Tesla's ones.

Their 75 kWh Cars have more range than other Cars with 100 kWh packs."
2021-07-02 11:44:44,wallstreetbets,"Nah. 1.4 billion people over there. Insane population. 1/1000 maybe not 1/15. 

I agree they will absolutely use every advantage they have  to compete with us. Fair or not. 

But have you EVER seen an original product out of China that‚Äôs higher quality than the rest of the world? 

I can‚Äôt think of a single example."
2021-07-02 18:16:49,wallstreetbets,"They also solve manufacturing issues in terms of scale. Tesla beating their pace to prove 900,000 cars this year. Last year was 500,000. 

You can‚Äôt compete with their innovation. Or their scaling."
2021-07-02 13:57:12,wallstreetbets,This is inaccurate. There are many people with reservations for a and x and are waiting for their vehicles. Model S refresh had the delivery event recently and only started getting into the hands of customers.
2021-07-02 10:56:57,wallstreetbets,Very true. Doubting Elon at this point is just asinine.
2021-07-02 18:36:40,wallstreetbets,You do realize there are multiple companies producing more cars then tesla since years and they do this despite having a much more complex product with way more options to take care of?

2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Who needs Diamond Hands when you have Balls of Steel - $CLF - Cleveland Cliffs You‚Äôve probably recently seen CLF on WSB, CNBC, and all over the place lately? Why is that‚Ä¶? Because Steel is going fucking crazy right now, and CLF is ahead of the curve.

So, what‚Äôs the play? Why is it a play? How is it play? Buckle up boys: close out of porn hub, grab a beer, and prepare for your smooth brain to gain a half-wrinkle. You‚Äôre going to be here a while.

Let‚Äôs start with the company, Cleveland Cliffs. This company is 174 fucking years old, employs 25,000 people, and it‚Äôs traditionally been the largest and oldest independent iron ore mining company in the USA. They own or co-own five active iron ore mines in Minnesota and Michigan and maintain an annual rated iron ore production capacity of approximately 28.0 million long tons.

Ok, so what? Who the fuck cares ‚Äì mining and steel production isn‚Äôt sexy, pink-haired septum pierced hippies hate it, and it‚Äôs barely a blip on Wall Street‚Äôs radar. Guess what- I care, and you should too.

When evaluating a company, there are several dimensions to look at - the people and their long-term strategies behind the company are some of the most important.  Let‚Äôs go deeper.

Cue in Lourenco Goncalves. **This maniacal son of a bitch joined CLF seven years ago as CEO through a contested proxy battle** and he‚Äôs been transforming the company and telling [Goldman Sachs analysts they are embarrassments to their parents ever since](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/19/ceo-berates-analysts-you-are-a-disasterthey-will-have-to-commit-suicide.html). The fucking balls on this guy. This is the kind of guy you want on your team. He's nuts, but he's going to prove everyone else wrong and get shit done. In the last seven years, LG‚Äôs entire initiative and strategy has been to completely transform an overleveraged wilting company, into what it is today ‚Äì the USA‚Äôs largest flat-rolled steel company and the largest iron ore pellet producer. But again, big whoop, right? Who the fuck cares? Let's go deeper.

&#x200B;

Transformation: Operational Strategy

So, what‚Äôs changed? Just last year, **CLF acquired two major steelmakers: AK Steel and ArcelorMittal USA. THIS IS HUGE** **and what Wall Street hasn‚Äôt seemed to fully process**. With this move, CLF has set itself up to own the entire aspect of the operations process and now they are VERTICALLY INTEGRATED. This means that they own and control everything upstream and downstream ‚Äì from ore in the ground to selling products to end-user customers. This gives them added scale of operations, greater market share through acquired accounts, new markets, less competition, operational leverage, cost savings throughout the supply chain, and more. Imagine if Volkswagen bought Porsche and Audi to gain more market share and leverage efficiencies? Oh wait, they already did that because that‚Äôs what successful & growing companies do to become even more successful. They see a bigger picture and take a short term loss for the much more profitable long term gain.

&#x200B;

Customers and Revenues:

CLF‚Äôs main bread and butter is selling steel to the automotive industry. You know, the industry that has been getting fucking insane valuations with EV‚Äôs; the industry that S&P Global expects to grow another 15% this year despite the chip shortages? Yeah, that industry. What‚Äôs great is that **AK Steel, now owned by CLF, had 63% market participation in the auto industry, ‚Äú*****‚Ä¶which no other steel mill in the entire world can replicate***‚Äù, according to Goncalves on CNBC. Taken from CLF‚Äôs 10-K: ‚ÄúDue to the much larger operational footprint we now have, we anticipate synergies of approximately $310 million from asset optimization, economies of scale and streamlining overhead, over half of which has already been set in motion. ‚Äú

Right now, CLF maintains their revenues per vertical as follows (From 10-k):

**Automotive 45 %**

Infrastructure and manufacturing 15 %

Distributors and converters 13 %

Steel producers 27 %

Again, so fucking what? Why so many numbers? Who gives a shit, what does it mean? Guess what: I give a shit, and you should too. Here's what it means:

""The exacting requirements for servicing the automotive market generally allows for higher selling prices for products sold to that market than for the commodity types of carbon and stainless steels sold to other markets. As the only North American producer of high-efficiency NOES (Non-Oriented Electrical Steel), which is a critical component of H/EV motors, CLF is positioned to potentially benefit from the growth of H/EVs going forward. Likewise, the growing customer adoption of H/EVs may also increase demand for improvements in the electric grid to support higher demand for more extensive battery charging.""

For those who can‚Äôt read good ‚Äì the auto industry in particular needs precision requirements from steel inputs for safety and efficiency. This means CLF can charge higher prices for a more technical product and the players in the space are limited. Who do you think can spin up an iron ore mine, build a factory to roll steel, and sell it to the end customer? Nobody but the players already in the space. It would take Amazon at least 5 years to be ready to capitalize on this market (Mining permits, Ecological Studies, Building permits, Construction, Operational spin up, etc.) The players in the space are all that are it - and CLF just ate two of them.

Ace the hole:

Added onto this, the prices of steel have tripled, and there is no end in sight. Every month, pricing keeps going higher. This translates to pure tendies. This won‚Äôt last forever, but damn‚Ä¶ two good years of boosted profits is a hell of a tail wind coming right off of two huge ground shaking acquisitions. It‚Äôs a great set-up and CLF is taking full advantage of it by paying down long-term debt, de-leveraging risk, and returning money to the shareholders (Goncalves words, not mine). Notice how I haven‚Äôt even mentioned the trillion-dollar infrastructure bill yet ‚Äì which happens to fall under at least 42% of CLF‚Äôs revenue stream. I don‚Äôt know enough about the bill to properly factor in what and how much of a benefit CLF may see from it, but it‚Äôs not hard to imagine how a steel company would benefit from a $1T infrastructure spending spree.

By now, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre holding that small, yet rock hard banana in your pants and you‚Äôre already thinking of how you‚Äôre going to tell your wife‚Äôs boyfriend Axel that you don‚Äôt need his weekly allowance anymore. Not so fast, we have more work to do.

So, let‚Äôs assume that CLF is undervalued. Let‚Äôs assume that Wall Street is too focused on tech at the moment and overlooked this small, yet well-established and fast-growing steel maker in Ohio. Let‚Äôs assume that steel prices will maintain their highs for another year. If CLF is undervalued, then what is it actually worth?

JP Morgan thinks $39

UBS thinks $28

BofA thinks $25

Goldman Sachs thinks $20 (fuck Goldman)

Right now, I‚Äôm at $32.25

I‚Äôve combed through their financials, 10K‚Äôs and most recent 10-Q after their Acquisitions to get the best numbers I can and come up and a price which I think is conservative.  **Disclaimer:** I‚Äôm not a professional ‚Äì I believe my numbers are good, but not perfect. I could have missed something or multiple things, it‚Äôs almost certain that I did. This isn't financial advice. My assumptions could be off and my estimates are approximations. If you see something that I missed, overlooked, or think that I'm retarded, please tell me and I'll revise it.

My Main Assumptions:

\- Steel prices will continue roaring through end of this year, and maybe until Q3 of 2022.

\- CLF will use their profits to pay down long-term debt and finalize their newly acquired assets, which is what they have said they will do

\- Their new business operation will yield new efficiencies and synergies where they can lower their Cost of Goods Sold (historically around 75%). In my projections, I‚Äôve tweaked COGS to be a bit higher in the next couple of years to account for the overall chaos of two crazy big acquisitions, and due to the fact that the reason why the number has been so large in Q4 2020 and Q1 2021, was they were moving all of their new assets and steel inventories around the US, which translates to a lot of shipping cost because steel is heavy.

\- I‚Äôm assuming that next year they will start to lower their inventories, which I believe are currently bloated from the acquisitions.

\- I did not factor in any other new broad sweeping strategy plays or acquisitions

\- Many of my projections are based on trend functions, averages, or general educated guesses.

\- ‚ÄúHey wait a second, you show that CLF will only show $1.4 billion income for 2021, but they   upgraded guidance to expect $5 billion this year‚Äù. Correct, but that number shown in the pretty graph in the 10-k is ‚ÄúAdjusted‚Äù EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure. Nothing wrong with that, but I prefer to evaluate via GAAP and Un-Adjusted.

Ok, let‚Äôs re-cap ‚Äì

For the Apes: Ape Strong. Steel Strong. Ape and Steel Together Stronger

For the Autists: An old washed-up mining company has transformed into an upgraded steel manufacturer that is ready to play in the big leagues with new assets, boat loads of fresh money, and very few analysts on Wall Street have priced it in.

For the Retards: Buy high sell low.

&#x200B;

Ok, I'm jacked to the tits and ready to ""Invest"". What‚Äôs the play?

Looking at it from a TA perspective at daily candles, the steel sector has been ripping the last 6 months, creating an ascending triangle. What I see happening in the next month or two is another leg up ‚Äì right into that $30 zone and maybe hit $35 by EoY depending on steel prices. CLF earnings are on 7/22, which I think there will be a run-up to, and/or the day of. Hard to say. In addition to that, Steel is a long play in and of itself.

If you are risk-tolerant and want something short-term, play the earnings call. If you are more conservative ‚Äì go for deep ITM LEAPS, which is what I‚Äôll be doing."

2021-07-02 13:39:29,wallstreetbets,"One very interesting thing about whats happening in the steel industry is that China's steel output is dropping already rather dramatically. The reason is because of their ongoing trade war with Australia. China runs on Australian coal that has been unofficially banned in the country since October. Oh and their own supplies of coal in the past month have been compromised and are largely unusable, some major industrial accident. Leading to massive power shortages. Steel Mills have not been able to operate at the same level for quite a few months now. the CCP also has as others have said been cracking down on steel producers on top of that to keep more steel in the country.

TLDR: China has far less power = far less steel = big win for everyone else."

2021-07-02 13:09:17,wallstreetbets,"What are the implied EBITDA and Revenue multiples you‚Äôre getting based on the valuation you have via the income approach? How do those compare to comps? I would definitely sanity check that before concluding on your value per share. 

If your implied multiples are near the high end of the comp set range, you‚Äôve likely over valued the company and vice versa.

Edit: I ran a quick and rough check myself. Couple of holes I‚Äôll poke in your analysis: 

 - With an aggressive outlook I think your discount rate is too low. There should be some extra alpha there for risk of not hitting the projections. 

 - I did a *rough* comp pull and multiple comparison - I think you need to evaluate on an adjusted basis in order for your value to make sense. Using that GAAP measure for EBITDA is giving me a 22.8x EV/EBITDA NFY multiple. Of the comps I pulled, the highest I see is 16x. If you use the non GAAP EBITDA (which is what this is likely trading on), your value starts to make much more sense. From CapIQ I‚Äôm seeing an estimate of 5.7 billion in EBITDA next year, which implies a 4.7x EBITDA multiple. This is much better and is actually right at the median of the comp set I pulled. 

I think the analysis was great and the concluded value makes sense - might be a little rich but it‚Äôs definitely not unreasonable. I‚Äôm in."

2021-07-02 18:34:48,wallstreetbets,"Here's what's missing from your analysis. This rip on steel follows on the heels of a similar trend for lumber. That's because construction is a larger % than automotive by market segmentation. Steel has been going full blown parabolic after bottoming out about 10 months ago. This dip was preceded by idling of capacity and was an overreaction to COVID, creating a backlog in the mill order books, automotive included. (Turning on blast furnaces is a real bitch, btw.) So, the only saving grace has really been a softening of automotive demand, as a byproduct of chip shortages.

As a Category Manager for Ferrous Raw Materials (Steel), I conduct business with CLF through several of their mills, but also know what's happening in other regions and with other mill networks. What's unique about CLF aside from their size and reach, is their adoption of a ""value vs. volume"" model; something that was mentioned in the Steel Success Strategies conference back in October of 2020. What this means, is that the mill is willing to artificially constrict capacity or slow walk expansion or bring online new capacity and furnaces, or otherwise restart idled furnaces, to fully relieve the demand issues of the market place. This is actually not good news and the fair market value for steel is not what we're seeing today. These comments were made in front of other mills globally, in front of buyers from all over, and no-doubt wields influence in the market place. If they speak it, others will adopt this same stance.

While some of the scarcity issues are real, CLF and many other mill networks are taking this time to right-size their output to keep the current prices sustained. This dangerous calculation has blown up in their faces historically, because this isn't the first time they've done it. 2008 is a perfect example.

So what are the repercussions of this current market activity and the operating model that the steel supply chain is exploiting? Well, for starters, manufacturers can't modify their price books at a pace that keeps up with the changing price of the steel, which means they are absorbing a lot of the cost over time. This reduces their profitability due to the lag. Eventually, they can't make their products or sell them, and sales begin to recede, businesses begin closing their doors. It's only when customers stop ordering that they'll start to modify their production behavior.

In conclusion, this overly rapid expansion of actual profits vs. projected profits is very alarming. In the short-term, some people are going to get very rich. However, the blow-back has the potential to be both severe, and impact down stream sectors.

If you plan to use CLF to make money, be careful. Watch housing starts, watch lumber & zinc, watch jobs #'s, and the manufacturing sector just for starters. Have a plan and follow it. If you don't, LC is going to eat you for lunch."

Tariffs are indeed keeping steel prices elevated. It will only be a matter of time (I would think, but I could be wrong), before Biden will lift or at the least lessen the tariffs. This would in turn lower the cost of acquiring steel from China. However, there is no telling when that will happen, how much he will lower the tariffs, if there will be terms/conditions attached to new incoming steel, etc. Because of our current ""trade war"" and deteriorating relations with China, who knows what will happen and when.

2021-07-02 16:30:25,wallstreetbets,"I work in this industry and the common take from the service centers is that we should expect the CRU to trend downward through Q4 and find a new tariffed-normal into Q1 of 2022. 

We don‚Äôt expect to hit $30/cwt again for a long time, and expect the mills to be able to thread the higher-price needle for some time. 

I‚Äôm in manufacturing, but not automotive. Part of the skyrocketing prices since last September were tariffs, but also some unexpected maintenance and striking, which the mills used as cover to drive the pricing higher since they didn‚Äôt make jack-shit during covid. 

From early September until around May, it wasn‚Äôt a question of what you would pay for steel, it was if you could get it. That‚Äôs mostly died down now as manufacturers have hedged along the way and have some excess inventory and also mill production has started to catch up. 

The service centers have largely eaten this along the way, but it‚Äôll look up for them as the CRU declines and their decently-sized manufacturers are on lagging-average CRU programs (manufacturers will be buying higher than market for a while from the service centers as the CRU declines). 

Anyway, all that to say I think you‚Äôre pretty spot-on in your assessment overall, especially on this company, though I think there might be some opportunity to short steel along the way. 

But I‚Äôm retarded and this isn‚Äôt financial advice either."
2021-07-02 11:15:12,wallstreetbets,The thing is who says China is exporting? China is literally doing the same thing as us rn. They need steel and CCP is keeping their steel for their own infrastructure plans. This even if we lift tarrifs. In the short term china ain't exporting steel.
2021-07-02 13:47:37,wallstreetbets,"China recently rescinded their domestic rebate on steel and their upcoming implementation of a tariff is an open secret


As it turns out they need steel like the rest of the world and creating a ton to export doesn‚Äôt make sense

2021-07-02 10:41:09,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm asking a genuine question. I‚Äôm not proposing I have an answer. That‚Äôs there the question mark comes in. If the answer is ‚Äúno‚Äù, then so be it."

2021-07-02 10:15:38,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs how he ‚Äúfeels‚Äù
2021-07-02 12:33:38,wallstreetbets,"He said deep ITM, not ATM. There's a huge difference between an ATM leap and leap that's already sitting at a 1 delta."
2021-07-02 19:06:10,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. It‚Äôs still leverage because, at ~1 delta, you‚Äôre reaping the results of owning 100 shares, but only paying the intrinsic value (and very little, if any, extrinsic value) of 100 shares, not the full price of 100 shares. There‚Äôs just not any ADDITIONAL leverage found by (delta x underlying price) / (option premium), which ATM or OTM options have (unless they‚Äôre priced stupidly or IV is crazy high).

Quick examples on CLF:

It closed regular trading hours today at 22.37. The deepest ITM call is at a $2 strike, 1.0 delta, and mid price of $20.23 premium:

Leverage = (1.0 x $22.37) / ($20.23) = ~1.1057x leverage.

The closest ATM strike is $22, with a 0.6793 delta, and a mid price of $7.53 premium:

Leverage = (0.6793 x $22.37) / ($7.53) = ~2.018x leverage. 

Now compare that to an OTM strike of $24 at a July 16th expiration, with a 0.2978 delta, and mid price of $0.50 premium:

Leverage = (0.2978 x $22.37) / ($0.50) = $13.32x leverage. 

The higher leverage is built in to entice because the probability of profit is lower and, in the last example, there is less time to get to that breakeven and beyond to make a profit."
2021-07-02 10:48:53,wallstreetbets,"Speaking directly about Steel - Chinese steel is cheap. Really cheap. Since steel is largely a commodity, are you going to buy a ton of steel for $200 or $150. The tariffs have been there to prevent China from flooding the market with Steel and essentially breaking down US Steel companies profits, people losing jobs, etc. Hence the political motivation. 

American Joe doesn't buy bulk steel, large corps do, and they pass those prices along to American Joe. Joe doesn't care where the steel came from because it all looks, feels, and more or less is the same to him. Tariffs are slightly hurting American Joe, but governments see a ""bigger picture""."

2021-07-02 15:10:58,wallstreetbets,"How else would they built the great steel wall of China ? 

China views steel as national security historically if you‚Äôve read anything about the 1950s Great Leap Forward. They literally starved (conservatively 10mil) people in order to ramp steel productions. 

People were melting cooking pots and pans, feeding backyard furnaces with wood just to keep up with demand. 

Steel production is a big identity of the CCP"

2021-07-02 11:09:07,wallstreetbets,There *is* word that China is enacting a steel export tax of 15-20% in the next few days which would make exporting less attractive.
2021-07-02 18:39:12,wallstreetbets,Chinese steel is cheap because it's subsidized by the government to entice the manufacture of steel semi-finished goods.

2021-07-02 10:53:10,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm kind of referring to indirect offshoring. As an example, another comment commented on tariffs. This makes offshore produced goods cheaper when tariffs are not in place.

2021-07-02 11:16:28,wallstreetbets,"So, lower supply coming out of China - so higher global prices?"

2021-07-02 10:19:39,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like when the government gave a mountain of money to telecom companies in the '90s to give every American access to 40mbps broadband or better for $20/mo or less.  Law didn't include any penalties or payback provisions if they failed to do it, so the telecom companies just took the money, pocketed it, and did absolutely nothing.  Obama's stimulus program included some money for broadband projects too.  I don't know how that worked out on the nationwide stage, but I know in my state of West Virginia the scam that masquerades as a company named Frontier wired up the entire city of Philippi with fiber, turned it on on Christmas Eve (the deadline to qualify for stimulus funds), collected their check.... and to this day has not connected a single customer to it.  If these laws do not spell out in excruciating detail exactly what the companies have to do to qualify, including offering the service to customers at a reasonable price, with required payback of funds if they fail to complete on time or with steep penalties if they fail in their obligations, they simply won't do it.  They'll do the bare minimum to get a check from their DC daddy and rely on the poor rising up to protect them if anyone complains."

2021-07-02 17:13:41,wallstreetbets,"You do realise China built 1000s of miles with 1 trillion right? China has more high speed rail tracks than rest of the world combined. They built all that in the last 15 years.

France built high speed rail at $15 million per mile.

 California spent $200 million per mile in comparison‚Ä¶ to build between Bakersfield and Merced.


California is filled with crooks, they raised $1.6 billion through gas tax to build housing for homeless, spent $600 million of it on ‚Äúconsultants‚Äù and other bullshit before building a single house. Finally, they came up with a housing plan that costs $500,000 per house for the homeless. They charged the tax payers $300,000 per portapotty for the homeless.


These scumbag politicians in California love to tax gas, but that disproportionately hurts the poor. As gas tax is basically a tax on the poor. Rich people are not commuting more than poor people every day. Gas tax hurts people who commute the most to work, aka poor people who cannot live in the city and drive long distance to work every day.
And gas tax also increases cost of transporting food and increases food prices for everyone.

They justify gas tax by saying it‚Äôs supposed to encourage people to move to electric vehicles, but there are no electric vehicles available in the fucking market that poor people can afford and that can genuinely work for them.

If you are a worker in the service industry making $15 an hour, you cannot afford a car that costs more than $15k. There are no electric cars in this price range, especially there are no electric cars available under 30k that have more than 200 miles of range that most people can use to replace their gas cars. Most poor people drive older cars and there isn‚Äôt a big enough used electric car market either. So what the fuck are these poor people supposed to buy if you want to ‚Äúencourage them‚Äù to buy electric by increasing tax? M
If someone is looking to buy a $40,000 BMW, your tax may encourage them to buy a $45,000 tesla instead. What the fuck is a GAP cashier who is thinking of buying a $10,000 used Camry supposed to buy to avoid your stupid gas tax?

If tesla is charging 28c/kwh (which is pretty close to gas cost by the way), the cost nationwide probably averages about to 13c/kwh which is 100% revenue. Sure it doesn't pay for the supercharger itself which can be quite costly, but they are banking 100% on cost of electricity and the superchargers themselves don't require much maintainence from what I have heard...If they do, say 6 full charges per 24 hour period, and they cost bout $22 each, then $22\*6\*(1/2) = $66 left per day. If a supercharger station lasts 20 years, $24090\*20 - 250k = $231K. 

&#x200B;

And all of that doesn't include the fact that the more superchargers they install, the more likely people will likely be to actually buy teslas.

2021-07-02 16:32:41,wallstreetbets,Not ignoring GOP fault. Accepting GOP obstructionism as reality. Wasting time when you could be using the tools that work.

2021-07-02 18:19:18,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm finding it hard to believe. Okay my Honda push mower doesn't have emissions controls but still you're saying that the 5 gallons of gas I'll use to last me the whole summer is worse than my civic using 13 gallons a week commuting (sometimes a lot more)?
2021-07-02 18:41:45,wallstreetbets,"I'm no climate scientist, here is the EPA quote:

The EPA estimates that hour-for-hour, gasoline powered lawn mowers produce 11 times as much pollution as a new car.

Then boom, you have no wealth in your economy and boom, your country is no longer world leader. You may be okay with that, but some other people in other countries would much rather america as world leader over china.

2021-07-02 18:22:55,wallstreetbets,"It won't be 500-700 in 5 years on average, sorry. If you were a regular in /r/electricvehices you would know that is not going to be the case. A lot of the new chemistries and cathode developments being made will add up to lower cost and improved range, but a lot of this will be used to make the car lighter by using fewer cells and to lower the price point to capture more sales from ICE cars, rather than just blindly adding range. People who only need 300 miles of range vs 500 would opt for a cheaper car, rather than pay extra for a battery they don't need. There will be longer range options for those who don't mind paying for the ability to travel further."

2021-07-02 16:37:24,wallstreetbets,"Like I said earlier it‚Äôs fine to show frustration with Democrats. But I think that people really overestimate how much power they have with such a slim majority.

And even if they keep sending a bunch of bills that get blocked in the senate until they use the reconciliation, then it‚Äôs still a win for them because it would show anybody on the fence exactly how obstructionist the GOP really are"

Wish, Didi... what‚Äôs next Cramer?"
2021-07-02 08:59:22,wallstreetbets,"Investing in Chinese tech seems really risky. China - US / western relations at all time low. Companies are actually finally following through on diversifying supply chains. China is cracking down on tech firms and essentially any person or entity that has too much influence, even if they toe the party line. Eventually the SEC and regulatory agencies will have to do their jobs and a bunch of Chinese entities will be delisted as they don't meet NYSE audit requirements at all... Right? Right?

I dunno man. Unless they come out with nuclear fusion or a functional production quantum computer or some shit I'm not about to invest in Chinese companies right now"
2021-07-02 11:44:58,wallstreetbets,It's a fucking IPO they are volatile as shit.  Don't buy IPOs especially not Chinese ones.

2021-07-02 11:05:58,wallstreetbets,"Tite is misleading as fuck.
 
1) Is a cybersecurity review, that shit is toothless and happens all the time. Massive data breaches happen at US companies all the time and stock barely dips, or quickly recovers.
 
2) Funny how they failed to mention stock dipped 7% AFTER a massive 16% up run yesterday."
2021-07-02 09:11:10,wallstreetbets,Just inverse whatever Kramer says at this point

2021-07-02 14:07:01,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn‚Äôt say that entirely. Yes, he did mention it he did say buy as many shares as you can. Immediately after he said that‚Äîhe went straight into making the counter argument about chinese  stock delisting scandals and how Chinese might be using NYSE just for capital etc etc.. 
so yes in fact said buy but at the same time gave the warning for potential risk with reason."
2021-07-02 16:44:24,wallstreetbets,The CCP knew full well when IPO was to take place. This action looks too orchestrated even though they prospected it a month ago. Not sure what the purpose is but going to be a drag on this company as they can‚Äôt sign up new users.

I woupd buy it but not at an evaluation close to uber when they have a business 1/3rd the size and most of that is in china where they win buy default since the CCP doesnt allow competition. India is going to fuck them over and they could only compete with uber in latam while they subsidize rides which will come to and now they they are public.

I just dont understand how someone could hold this stock over uber. Their self driving division is a joke as well."
2021-07-02 10:45:20,wallstreetbets,Yeah really dont understand why anyone would want to touch this huge pile of shit.

2021-07-02 10:59:48,wallstreetbets,"The risk is all priced in man, high risk high reward.
 
The best example is Luckin Coffee, that stock got obliterated in 2020 because of shady chinese practices, but what people don't realize is...the stock was trading at 1/10th of comparative US companies after their financial scandal, that's a huge discount.
 
Luckin has went up 5X in the last year since then."
2021-07-02 13:34:47,wallstreetbets,not that you just summarized a news report that was streamed in YAHOO just before didi was traded publicly or anything.
2021-07-02 15:46:37,wallstreetbets,They've halted new users being able to register for DiDi for the time being. That seems a little more significant than just a security review itself.

2021-07-02 10:48:38,wallstreetbets,Fuck China and anyone who supports the CCP. Only cucks buy didi

2021-07-02 09:02:01,wallstreetbets,This is now the 3rd investigation into DIDI. That‚Äôs not a good thing for any company in China.
2021-07-02 10:46:48,wallstreetbets,Lol the stock even without the news is majorly over valued. Im guessing uber is also dumping a huge percent of its 15% stake because it knows this is going tits up and dara isnt a fuckboy
2021-07-02 10:48:12,wallstreetbets,Yep the big banks ML are just trying to prop this shit up for as long as they can before it crashes. They know it cant hold anywhere near the 14$ mark for long. Im buying puts around 12$ as soon as they become available
2021-07-02 11:53:08,wallstreetbets,DNUT is like wish though.  shitty management team making poor decisions
2021-07-02 13:38:37,wallstreetbets,why did you buy high? should have done your DiDi
2021-07-02 13:57:27,wallstreetbets,"then stop talking about him ‚Äî duh. What are you, the free speech police? 

Don‚Äôt forget he has a TV Show and all he has to do is say ‚Äúbuy this security‚Ä¶‚Äù and people do. 

what‚Äôs weird is that you have made like 20 comments in this chat house in the past 60 days and here you are emotionally invested with a superiority complex out the ass with out really any talking points to leverage credibility from. Just a bunch of chat house commentary-of which comes from most typical chatters‚Äîthat hasn‚Äôt added any kind of analytical input about a stock.

2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Charging station gravy train (EVGO) With the current administration pushing green energy and every car manufacturer making real entries into the fully electric car market, charging stations are going to be going up in every strip mall and star bucks parking lot in the U.S. 

On top of the infrastructure evgo has, they also have a deal with GM for having 2750 charging station in the US by 2023. That's on top of the 800 they currently have. 

Blink charging is the closest comparable charging company with a share price close to $40, and evgo has a larger market cap. (+700m) evgo share price yesterday was $14.50

Reguardless of short term gains to be had. The ev charging market is set to grow 100x by 2040. (Similar to telecom, in the late 90s, 00s)     

I'm retarded and know nothing about financial markets or green energy.

2021-07-02 08:43:02,wallstreetbets,"Why didn't you mention the largest charging station network?

CHPT

Do real DD into the space and I think you will see why CHPT is a better buy. In this space network size and charge times will be key.

Also consider that most charging will take place at home and on level 2 vs at DC quick charge. CHPT has the largest installed lvl 2 network and offers the #1 selling home charger on Amazon (last I saw, this might not be current but I'm too lazy to research)."

2021-07-02 09:58:15,wallstreetbets,They have double the fast chargers chpt does. And public fast chargers are the future for the space.
2021-07-02 08:45:36,wallstreetbets,"Takes me 15 minutes to charge my car at a CHPT DC fast charger. Plus last time I did it it cost a whopping $4 vs the $30 and $5 min it takes to fill up my ICB car.


The next Gen DC fast chargers will cut that time to around 5 min/charge. Dwell time at charging won't be a huge issue as the tech improves, which it is.

I also almost never charge at a public station. I charge over night at home, so charge time is really irrelevant to my EV use. I think this will be the case with most folks who switch to EV."

2021-07-02 08:55:05,wallstreetbets,"Charge point is the biggest charging station holder in the US.  But two things, bidens infrastructure bill if it passes will pump mad money into charging stations.  And two, charge point didn't get listed today, looks like a ground floor to me.   

 DC quick charge will always be faster than level 2 and at home.   You can move alot more power faster via DC vs ac. Think like a welder. (I'm an electrician, I've installed dozens of at home chargers)"

2021-07-02 10:12:51,wallstreetbets,CHPT owns 70% of the market share in the US and if you think they won‚Äôt be innovative to match their competitors on fast charging then you‚Äôre wrong.
2021-07-02 17:46:36,wallstreetbets,ChargePoint sells their chargers and doesn‚Äôt own the liability and depreciating hardware that EVgo does. Hard pass.
2021-07-02 08:51:18,wallstreetbets,"If it gets to 5 mins, tree huggers may have the patience. But avg consumers will not want to wait even 1 min longer than they have to. Perception will be key to adoption. 

Haven't done further DD for a year but very happy to see the incredible advance!

Was that a full charge in 15 mins?? Wow!
I remembers seeing people at a charge station spreading out like homeless people living out of their cars."
2021-07-02 09:11:38,wallstreetbets,"Do you have a good source for the market cap? Looks like it's pretty short after a SPAC merger so the numbers may be all over the place. I don't want to take the post down just yet because it looks like a really interesting topic, but I need to verify that everything is in order first."
2021-07-02 11:35:40,wallstreetbets,"CHPT may have this, but from the government contractors that are buying into the charging port infrastructure plan, they‚Äôre going to award more to competitors to make sure a monopoly isn‚Äôt formed from CHPT. To add on, if CHPT is a large business and if EVGO is listed as a small business the feds will jump to award/pay EVGO simply for being a small business, as the feds are REQUIRED to award small businesses.

Again, I haven‚Äôt looked into seeing if either are small or large businesses yet, but if CHPT is a large business and EVGO is listed as small, this will most likely end up being in favor for EVGO"

2021-07-02 12:24:44,wallstreetbets,"Average consumers will care more about the electricity being 1/4 the cost of gas than about how long it takes to fill. Look at the lines at a Costco gas station, people wait hours to save a few bucks"
2021-07-02 09:32:15,wallstreetbets,"Spreading out like homeless is an over exaggeration.  But 15min does seem quick. Maybe it wasn't empty. 

If you've ever pulled up to a charging station on 0 & have to get to full, you quickly learn to pick a station with lots to do (a mall, costco, target, etc) or you bring your entertainment (teleconferences, reading, etc). But it's also a great time to have solitude if you live in a house with kid(s) who want to interact with you all the time...

Battery swaps or quicker superchargers would be great for road trips."
2021-07-02 11:34:50,wallstreetbets,https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/evgo-merges-with-spac-to-go-public-51611315307
2021-07-02 13:16:51,wallstreetbets,"The small business note is a good thought. It looks like EVGO may qualify under the SBA definition for the NAICS code. I didn't dig deep, but looks like their code is 335999 and as long as they are sub 500 employees, they'd qualify.

That said, that edge only exists while they are a small business. As soon as they scale up, they're directly competing."
2021-07-02 12:46:36,wallstreetbets,"Logical but people are anything but logical. 

People stand in line and they blame Costco for not having enough stations, not the gas. Wait 15 mins to charge and the blame goes directly to the tech.

I do agree that $ will be the best way to persuade people to change their habits. Govt support is crucial to any fundamental change. I'm not totally convinced that the new admin has enough will to push it to the point that the bulk of the population can see the economic advantage. Until then, I don't see it moving rapidly past Upper middle income toy."
2021-07-02 10:17:18,wallstreetbets,"I'm talking about perceptions. The average consumer isn't gonna accept ""go do something else for a while"". If u say breathe and seek your inner soul, you're gonna get punched.

A long career as a consultant managing expectations tells me it WILL be a major hurdle. It's classic. 

Set the timer on your phone to 5 mins and see just how long you last. I doubt 10% of the general public will get past 30 secs.

For fast adoption, it needs to be at least as fast as a regular gas station minimum. Battery swapping needs another look.

That and adding other zero carbon energy sources to the mix like LNG/RNG. Cow farts is free energy that would otherwise pollute the air. Can't rely on just one solution. $CLNE"
2021-07-02 14:16:59,wallstreetbets,"Yes that‚Äôs the edge they‚Äôll have playing into this, however, if they‚Äôre rewarded for multiple years at the time of the determination of being a small business, then they‚Äôll keep ahold of that. 

Only matters if there‚Äôs a recompete clause or if a BPA is made instead of the typical IDIQ - if IDIQ (which I would expect) then the price is locked

I‚Äôm the end, I‚Äôd have a hard time not seeing EVGO without a gov contract. This stock is cheaper than some of its competition, while it‚Äôs proven and has established business. So for a cheaper entry, this is also a good reason to invest, vs. going with CHPT that is over twice the price"
2021-07-02 10:33:23,wallstreetbets,"?? I drive a 2016 tesla model X 90D & wouldn't trade it for the world. Except maybe a 100D.

It did take some getting used to & is a pain on long road trips, but I've adjusted.  & I'm converting my friends/family  & neighbors. 

If you live in an apartment I can see the problem.  But if you live in a house, its totally worth it. There is a small increase in your electricity,  but minimal compared to gas prices.

My cousin who still owns an ICE tried to may a dig at me mentioning something about gas. I shut him down. I know nothing about gas & haven't for 5yrs. 

It seems difficult at first, but so was living on my own, paying bills & being a fully functional member of society.  That doesn't mean I'm going to regress to childhood."
2021-07-02 10:38:35,wallstreetbets,"Operative word is ""general public"". 

Great to see that the transition was relatively painless for you.

Cleaner more efficient future!"
2021-07-02 10:56:31,wallstreetbets,"I get it. But honestly when has the ""general public"" wholeheartedly & willing embraced a change. 401Ks vs pensions, we're still fighting that one. I think Enron made it less painful, but there are still people complaining about not having a pension

Cars & trains didn't immediately take off. They both took time & persuasion. There's always going to be early adaptors & laggers. Charging stations do need to become more robust & faster, because not everyone owns a home or have access to an outlet in their apartments. & those of use who do would need quick charging/fewer stops on a road trip. 

This battery swap intrigues me because I know from experience that the amount of miles the battery holds decreases over time. So my car doesn't get what it used to. If I swapped out the battery & got increased range i wouldn't want to give it back. Conversely,  if I had high range, swapped it out & got less range I'd be pissed. I wonder if that's why Musk rejected the idea."
2021-07-02 11:15:36,wallstreetbets,"Regarding battery swap;

My last DD on NIO was that you don't own the battery. U just lease it. (it was a long time ago so standard do your own DD mantra)

Makes better sense u pay for the energy u use and NIO maintains the batteries. I hate worrying about degrading my battery

General cheerleading;

Keep early adopting. It takes visibility for people to say ""hey maybe I should get one""

Show it off. Answer questions. Sell it. Faster. quiet. Stylish. Adoption is a lot harder and complex than it looks. So many great ideas thrown away for nothing but a lack of good perceptions."
2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NAS, undervalued, almost safe, if not moon, at least the sky. Listen up retards. I did some thinking, not very hard.

So airline companies are pretty messed up due to the rona, BUT WHAT IF I TOLD YOU - The rona will end.
NWARF (Norwegian air shuttle) doesn't give a fuck, they survived the rona, just barely, scraping the bottom of the barrel to survive.
The price is BOTTOMED!

Make no mistake, previous price ranges are extremely unlikely due to a lot of stock being issued. There is roughly 20x more stocks on market since before the rona. 
The price back then was a comfy $200, it's now sitting at 1.36. 
If they get back to previous levels of success, we can expect roughly 200 divided by 20, which may or may not be 10. Not that good with numbers. 

Thats right, we're looking at a comfy 10x. 

Before you ape in, this will of course take time, and hinges on leadership in NWARF to stay exceptional through the re-scaling on the business. Holiday season WILL come, and NWARF will be there to serve. It's a gamble I'm willing to take.

EDIT:
apperently it's called nwarf or Nas.ol depending on market it seems."

All players in space tourism will have an endless queue of wealthy customers for the few thousand seats available each year. There are 1.5m high net worth Americans alone. Never mind the global millions of millionaires. 

VG can easily be an $8bn business by 2026, by expanding into another 4 or 5 global spaceports, at 360 flights per spaceport per year, with an ave ticket price of ¬£600k. Three spaceports are which are under negotiation e.g. italy, UAE. Two more SS3 are in production already. The Delta class is on the drawing board. Commercial operations are due early 2022. Therefore, at that revenue level the stock should be worth conservatively around $350-700, which is a 10-20x multiple. A standard multiple for a growth business. (This doesn't even value any additional revenue from spaceport entertainment, or supersonic/hypersonic jet travel if that design makes it to market).

Today at $55 it's still a ground floor bargain. And has great retail support and momentum potential to hit $100 in the next couple of months, imo. It will remain a volatile stock with large swings, but the overall trajectory will be upwards as tests complete, research/training flights start, and commercial tourism takes off next year.

From the perspective one might see from inside a hedge fund or MM office? Because to me it seems like no one here satisfactorily understands the playing field, nor whether AMC or GME might squeeze again, and whether, under current rules, CLOV may squeeze to the type of numbers the latter two did.

Not to be a naysayer‚ÄîI‚Äôve made money off all three, and there are ways to continue making money‚Äîbut some further articulation of Short Squeeze mechanics might help direct conversation towards the most rewarding of retard bets. Also, squeeze mechanics ‚Äî eg. let‚Äôs all gather round in circled, hold each other and squeeze together‚Äîis fundamentally kinda gay, and I think the bears may have  found a way to beat retards who hold each other in such a queer way."

2021-07-02 12:56:17,wallstreetbets,"Listen up retards - I'm not trying to coordinate any sort of market manipulation, but AMC shareholders could potentially benefit from this technical analysis of one of the tools our benevolent overlord Adam Aron has granted us: the free large popcorn. 

As üåà bers and HFs try to lure the share price lower, AMC longs can employ some tactics of our own using one of the oldest tricks in the book.

Needed:

-tickets to F9 for this weekend

-Beadazzler

-Swiss army knife

As you stroll into your local AMC on a nice date with your AMC shares during this long weekend, proceed to the concession stand and receive your free large popcorn. After obtaining said popcorn, dip into the restroom and cut a small (or in most of your cases, a very small) hole in the bottom of the popcorn tub. Use the Beadazzler to beadazzle $77 on the inside bottom of the popcorn tub.

Now, comfortably seated in the luxurious AMC theater next to your AMC shares, perform the yawn-arm stretch move and awkwardly put your arm around your shares.  With your other hand, maneuver your tiny ding-a-ling through the hole in the popcorn tub. As you and your AMC shares finish the delicious popcorn, your AMC shares will look down into the tub and become focused on the beautiful number $77. Your AMC shares will be thinking about this number for the rest of the weekend and come out Tuesday ready to smash it.

Remember these words of wisdom: it doesn't matter if we win by an inch or win by a mile: winning is winning.

TL:DR the ole dick in the popcorn trick can take us to a new ATH

Positions: salty penis, xxx AMC shares"

2021-07-02 08:50:07,wallstreetbets,"Longers: people who think a stock/company‚Äôs will improve. They buy a share in a stock, watch it rise in value, and sell their shares later at a profit. 

Shorters: people who think a stock/company‚Äôs will not improve. They borrow someone else‚Äôs share, sell it in the market, buy another lower share at a lower price, replace that share with the one they borrowed, and keep the difference as a profit."
2021-07-02 08:50:54,wallstreetbets,"People short because they believe the company will perform poorly in the near or long term.  When you short, you borrow shares and immediately sell them.  Thus, you ow a debt of shares but not a fixed value.  If the company‚Äôs value declines, you then buy the shares back off the market at a lower price and close your position, pocketing the difference as profit.  Anyone with a margin account can take a short position, and going short is a great tool to make money from downturns or implosions.  It‚Äôs not the evil manipulation everyone wants you to think it is.  And generally speaking, if a company has high short interest, it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs primed to ‚Äòmoon‚Äô - its an indication that people think the company is fraudulent, hemorrhaging money, or otherwise destined to fail.  Will never understand how people on this board started looking for the most shorted companies to sink their money in."

""Our position is based on the fundamentals of the company and the fact its stock price has been inflated by call options, which is always temporary,"" Iceberg Research said in an email statement.

2021-07-02 13:36:00,wallstreetbets,Stonks on sale. I've never seen such a steal. I'm taking a loan to load up. CNBC told me the GDP is hottest since 1984. The economy is in fire. Nevermind a third of the GDP is printed by the government. What could go wrong? Keep them rates at 1% so stonks are the only game in town. Then hand the cash to these companies to do stonk buybacks to lower the number of shares. Then hand out cash and goose demand for buying the shares. This is sustainable like EV's and the power grid.

But now... now it's getting fucking ridiculous. Bears no where to be seen, bullied into oblivion on wsb lmao. And this market is fully detached from all sense of reasoning, and the valuation is approaching borderline unjustifiable. All signs of a bubble are there, gme/amc, etc. If spy hits 450 before end of the year, I'm 100% calling the whole stock market a bubble.

The time when this place is full of bears and bulls get called retarded instead... that's when i will buy. Problem is figuring out when that is. When is the pop? I am leaning towards it starting to unwind towards end of the year (50%+ correction) , but who knows.

also before u talk shit, i am fully invested on margin relax lmao"

**Denial**

This can‚Äôt be happening SPY is basically green 10 days in a row on low volume. My weeklies still have a chance. Look at it. It wants to tank so bad.

**Anger**

LOOK AT THESE LONG LADDER ATTACKS. This is blatant market manipulation. Where the heck is the SEC on this?! What the fuck!

**Bargaining**

If I average down on my puts here, can you please let me just break even? Come on. This is just unfair. I‚Äôll buy calls next time please JPow.

**Depression**

My weekly puts are -99%. The wife just gave me my divorce papers. Long $ROPE boys.

**Acceptance**

Lesson learned. I can‚Äôt be throwing my stimulus check at puts when rent is due. The soup kitchen has some fire gumbo on Tuesday and the public library has free internet. It‚Äôs going to be ok."

She gave me a dirty look and asked if I had any pay stubs and I told her I didn't make any money. She said I couldn't draw any money so I whipped out my green crayon and proceeded to draw tendies and the bitch called security. It's tough being an ape.

You have the reopening of businesses combined with the end of pandemic related benefits and eventual return of kids to school (freeing up parents to take jobs if they've been waiting on school year return).

Metals are moving up on the inflation angle (i.e. more people getting jobs than expected over next 3 months will put upward pressure on inflation).

Will be interesting to watch; JPow is going to keep saying inflation is transitory but we could see some much higher readings over next 3 months than expected."

i.e. If 850k people get jobs but 1 million rejoined labor force, that would actually lead to an increase in the unemployment rate.

The numbers come from 2 different surveys.


This was a super strong report and will likely lead to 2-3 more as strong as we head towards a return to normal school year.

Many parents of school age children will start looking for work in August-September as kids go back to school.

2021-07-02 11:00:01,wallstreetbets,Why did the stock that went up 80% in less than a month dump 25%? Hmmmm. Let me think‚Ä¶ this is a tricky one I must admit. Normally they are supposed to go up 80% every month.

2021-07-02 06:34:07,wallstreetbets,Its true. sometimes a CEO or COO can absorb the duties. Different companies are structure different some have no COO. Better yet some literally only have a CEO. Wish still has upper level management in the department just the CFO is leaving. You shouldn‚Äôt invest yourself to much in FUD dude. I doubt you even know how to read a financial statement.

You can literally run a company without any executives and just a Board that manages the company. How they choose to structure the company in the absence of the CFO really won‚Äôt make that much of a difference.

2021-07-02 12:40:17,wallstreetbets,"I know AMC is down today, but if you watch the video it's the short interest numbers tonight that matter most. If we catch the big corps with their ballsack stuck in a lawn chair it's gonna be open season."

2021-07-02 13:14:24,wallstreetbets,"10x upvotes with sub audio. it would also make your subtitles be like the actual words in the show, instead of trying to ignore what theyre saying in english and read it. loved it though"

2021-07-02 16:15:57,wallstreetbets,I still can't get over how bad the English version of Ultimate Battle is

2021-07-02 18:19:35,wallstreetbets,Epic
2021-07-02 18:35:37,wallstreetbets,DBZ?  Now I know for certain that AMC rides on the shoulders of dumbass kids.

2021-07-02 19:22:31,wallstreetbets,Hahaha you sir are a legend
2021-07-02 19:32:31,wallstreetbets,And that's not even our final form.
2021-07-02 12:47:39,wallstreetbets,Great meme work . Very well done but ewwww the english scene. Great meme work but use the Japanese one next time. The english version of the song is painful
2021-07-02 14:19:11,wallstreetbets,"CNK better, amc should never have been the meme stock. Cinemark much better company overall"
2021-07-02 17:35:49,wallstreetbets,The anime geeks in this sub are the absolute worst.
2021-07-02 17:51:09,wallstreetbets,"If everyone pulled out of all the other meme stocks and JUST put everything they have in AMC, you might overcome the current short interest and cause another squeeze.

Otherwise, it's apparent that the resources to squeeze further have been tapped out, and people who opened short positions at 60 are going to clean up off the wreckage of people who got into AMC last.

You've all been successfully divided and conquered, as predicted.  The rich people are rich for a reason and that's because they're a lot more clever than you."
2021-07-02 18:48:58,wallstreetbets,"FOR THOSE WHO DIDNT SELL AT $60+ Y'ALL FUCKED UP.

Sell while you can, you're going to end up bag holding. The top brass at AMC are giving each other fat bounses and rasies rather than innovating the company from out dated business model"
2021-07-02 13:12:39,wallstreetbets,The company is fucking us over with their employee stock options.
2021-07-02 17:27:55,wallstreetbets,Vegeta for that is pretty damn inspired

2021-07-02 13:07:04,wallstreetbets,"Sub > dub. I didn't realise the audio lyrics are also dubbed. Sounds ass to me, probably being an anime snob though."
2021-07-02 15:57:18,wallstreetbets,This was fucking awesome
2021-07-02 17:33:11,wallstreetbets,Too bad Yamcha wasn't there. Would've been a perfect Jim Cramer

2021-07-02 18:45:58,wallstreetbets,"This whole arc was fantastic, the art, the plot lines, the fight choreography.

2021-07-02 08:45:45,wallstreetbets,"I'm glad you liked it, if this post does well I'll probably keep making stonk video memes."
2021-07-02 07:16:30,wallstreetbets,"(I think this is Dragonball Super?

Just clarifying to help you in your search üòâ)

This is an episode? Or is it from a movie? 

Been ducking Dragonball Super, but now I'm ready to give it a go! 

What a way to start the day! Thank you!"
2021-07-02 16:29:59,wallstreetbets,I've never heard of that ETF. What sector does DBZ cover?
2021-07-02 15:23:10,wallstreetbets,Tournament of power bro. It's to save the universe from two 5 year olds with godly powers.
2021-07-02 11:22:59,wallstreetbets,Hey the post is only 5 hours old. We have time! Also I figured if the short interest report is sky high this evening the meme will gain even more popularity!
2021-07-02 07:01:59,wallstreetbets,Good thing they aren't the only shady financial institution!
2021-07-02 10:15:43,wallstreetbets,"Well, they‚Äôd be a good metaphor for Frieza."
2021-07-02 12:08:28,wallstreetbets,I made it entirely using KineMaster on my phone. It's been like ten years since I've explored with video editing and it's amazing what you can do on a phone now.
2021-07-02 11:31:31,wallstreetbets,"It's easy, buy high, sell low. Don't overthink it like a nerd."
2021-07-02 10:14:30,wallstreetbets,"Multiverse tournament where the loser's universe gets destroyed, they had a common goal."
2021-07-02 07:56:35,wallstreetbets,This aired a couple years ago my man
2021-07-02 06:20:13,wallstreetbets,"Look up Dragonball Super, they continue after DBZ (GT technically wasn't cannon) and it's has some pretty good arcs."
2021-07-02 13:12:05,wallstreetbets,He's holding the PLTR bags like a true prince!
2021-07-02 13:17:48,wallstreetbets,Yeah I think any future meme vids I'll do sub. Dragonball dub is just so close to my heart üò¢
2021-07-02 08:05:58,wallstreetbets,Didn't work out well for the last  penny prediction guy lets see how it works out for you
2021-07-02 09:08:46,wallstreetbets,Short it then Nostradamus
2021-07-02 18:16:56,wallstreetbets,It's the final arc of super
2021-07-02 13:09:51,wallstreetbets,Hah if I didn't want to watch the fight and instead read I'd do subs. Also not a lot of parody dialogue in this scene. I have some AOT footage that has the subs where I can replace parts of sentences.
2021-07-02 17:37:31,wallstreetbets,Hey anime provides some serious video meme material
2021-07-02 14:15:50,wallstreetbets,Just buy 2023 options at any strike and forget about it. You might be a bag holder for a year but it will go green (just like my poo when I eat certain candies).
2021-07-02 07:32:23,wallstreetbets,This is the final episode from dragonball super.
2021-07-02 13:11:31,wallstreetbets,"I watched both as they aired. I grew up with English dubbed DBZ so maybe I'm partial. But I generally choose dub over sub, the dubs nowadays are not as bad as the early 2000s stuff many grew up on."
2021-07-02 15:43:36,wallstreetbets,"I just can't get over the Texas accent in the DUBS. 

I mean, I guess he is supposed to be ""country"" but still."
2021-07-02 16:49:06,wallstreetbets,"For this part i like the sub wayyyyyy more than the dub, tbh it gives me chills every time"
2021-07-02 16:58:11,wallstreetbets,"People can buy older accounts 

Only commented to pop your bubble of optimism"
2021-07-02 07:50:05,wallstreetbets,"The first two arcs of Dragonball Super are basically the movies Battle of gods and Resurrection F. I'm my opinion the first two arcs are the weakest in Super because they feel like stretched out movies (because they are). The clip I used is from the final battle in the final arc of super, the tournament of power."
2021-07-02 15:24:28,wallstreetbets,Got damn. I stopped at cell. The android 20 or 21 or whatever. Missed everything after.
2021-07-02 08:03:17,wallstreetbets,Can't get margin called if you have apes pushing the price up
2021-07-02 14:03:17,wallstreetbets,Impressive that you made this on your phone. Did you animate the green dildo with KineMaster?
2021-07-02 10:43:31,wallstreetbets,Were goin to the moon in multiple dimensions.
2021-07-02 13:18:45,wallstreetbets,"loved it when i was a kid. when super came out i watched the sub and i cant go back now haha. also didnt want to wait for the dub, shit was wayyyy too far behind"
2021-07-02 15:59:15,wallstreetbets,Or my pee when I eat asparagus
2021-07-02 17:46:01,wallstreetbets,This is pretty much what I did but not as far out as 2023‚Ä¶ it felt really fucking good and I had no hesitation at all like I usually do with buying anything. My cocks dripping and my peanut brain has just crusted over but damn it feels good boys
2021-07-02 11:15:29,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm gonna have to rewatch the whole tournament. I don‚Äôt remember this at all
2021-07-02 07:48:31,wallstreetbets,"sweet, need to find that looks great thanks!"
2021-07-02 19:23:44,wallstreetbets,Some kind of Buu revival?
2021-07-02 16:10:21,wallstreetbets,I don't think it's the final episode.  The final episode was pretty much exclusively the Ultra Instinct fight.  I think this is at the start of the final battle between the two universes.  probably a good 25-30 episodes before the final.
2021-07-02 14:46:59,wallstreetbets,I dont know what you mean the dubs are better now. Its the same English voice actors. I also watch dubbed but mainly just DB because thats how i grew up and other voices for the chars just sound weird at this point.
2021-07-02 13:19:25,wallstreetbets,"I watched DBZ dubbed and then DBS subbed, the difference was fucking huge to me, so much that I went back and rewatched DBZ in dub. Goku's Japanese voice actor (who is an old little lady) portrays him exactly as the absolute retard he's supposed to be, instead of some machoman in the dub. And Freezer sounding like some English aristocrat in the dub makes me fucking cringe. I just can't do dub at all anymore."
2021-07-02 18:24:42,wallstreetbets,"DBZ is definitely good, but I personally don‚Äôt like the dub in DBS ONLY at this part since the background song, Ka Ka Kachi Daze, sounds worse. The singer is bad imo"
2021-07-02 17:41:19,wallstreetbets,Yeah but this is to autistic and fits pre 10m people in here.
2021-07-02 17:04:09,wallstreetbets,You think I can afford a reddit account with all my money depreciating in FDs?
2021-07-02 08:47:25,wallstreetbets,"I've seen Battle of Gods, haven't seen Resurrection F yet.

This clip definitely has me hyped to get into this series on Tournament of Power.
Great use of the clip!"
2021-07-02 17:02:46,wallstreetbets,I haven‚Äôt watched dbz in 15 years. How come goku doesn‚Äôt go super saiyen level whatever they‚Äôre at now?
2021-07-02 15:26:15,wallstreetbets,Last 2 arcs of super make up for the first two.
2021-07-02 14:04:28,wallstreetbets,Yes I used an image of a green candle with a clear background. KineMaster let's you use key frames with text and pictures.
2021-07-02 15:43:00,wallstreetbets,Really?    Did you have a bottle next to you during the premier?
2021-07-02 07:58:15,wallstreetbets,They did a great job on super once you get past the movie material which is the entirety of the first two arcs
2021-07-02 11:27:04,wallstreetbets,"Skip movie chapters, I think its like chapter 50 onwards (look it up)"
2021-07-02 17:08:04,wallstreetbets,"Same here. The voices throw me off for one, but I also think the English cut cell saga music was WAY better than the Japanese cut music. 

Like all of the Gohan unleashed music is incredible in the English dub... super disappointing in the sub."
2021-07-02 14:56:45,wallstreetbets,"I don't know it's just like, my opinion man"
2021-07-02 17:06:14,wallstreetbets,What does reddit accounts go for because 20 bucks is 20 bucks no homo
2021-07-02 12:27:36,wallstreetbets,You didn‚Äôt see broly? Fucking sick movie
2021-07-02 17:07:58,wallstreetbets,"This was a very long fight, this clip is just the finale where Goku is so drained he can barely pull out super Saiyan. In super the Goku hierarchy is:

Ultra instinct > SSJ blue kaioken > SSJ blue > SSJ god > SSJ 3 > SSJ2 > SSJ > saibamen > yamcha"
2021-07-02 15:04:24,wallstreetbets,Hahaha fair I was just pointing out its all the same voice actors so nothing really changed for any if the main cast.
2021-07-02 17:10:23,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't know had mine since college, ratchet as fuck was something my roommate said and of course I stole it and made it my username"
2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SentinelOne will be bigger than Crowdstrike Made a throwaway account because I work in endpoint security, specifically for a company that competes with Crowdstrike and Sentinelone so I can‚Äôt be seen to be praising our competitors lol

Let me say this on all the deals I work on if I come up against Crowdstrike I know what to say but when it‚Äôs Sentinelone im always like ‚Äúfuck‚Äù.

Their product is much better than Crowdstrike. For example the Mitre attack framework is what everyone judges security by these days (or at least that‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs going). It‚Äôs in all RFP‚Äôs something like ‚ÄúMust be able to demonstrate efficacy against Mitre framework‚Äù. You can see here how Sentinelone destroyed Crowdstrike 

https://www.esecurityplanet.com/endpoint/mitre-protection-tests-endpoint-security/

A lot of what I‚Äôm saying is very anecdote based but people love them and they are getting pushed very heavily now compared to six months ago so the ramp up in the next 6 months to a year will be big.

I don‚Äôt have much hard DD but what I can say is I hear their name a lot and 6 months ago I never heard about them much."

And the conclusion we came to for a large org is that Sentinel didn't win over CS in our review. They're definitely good, but didn't meet our org's requirements. Their sales team and support was best out of the three thought, so that was cool."

2021-07-02 13:30:08,wallstreetbets,Well I've done proof of concepts with all the major players and agree with OP. S1 is the leader of the pack in terms of technology and ability to detect unknown threats before anyone else. MS doesn't have a managed service like Crowdstrike or S1. Running a EDR is a full time job for a team of people which is where services like S1 vigilance or Crowdstrikes overwatch come in.

2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Inverse Head & Shoulder forming on WISH? Dear apes,

It seems that WISH might be forming an inverse head and shoulder, a very bullish pattern:

* Neckline around $15 - 15.4
* Shoulders around $11.8 - 12.2
* Head around $7.5 - 8 resulting from a 1-month accumulation phase
* Volume is decreasing on pullback to shoulder line, which is great according to [StockCharts](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=chart_analysis:chart_patterns:head_and_shoulders_bottom_reversal)

A breakout from the neckline would definitely confirm a change in trend and a price target around $22 - 23 is believable (according to TA purists)

[Inverse H&S forming on WISH?](https://preview.redd.it/6dbzs2knnr871.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c44d8935b085e62d4b7870cadf729e9d761eec3)

Furthermore, the price is now standing at 20 and 50 days exponential moving averages, with the 20d possibly crossing the 50d in case of rebound, which would add bullish sentiment.

The 100d one might continue to act as a resistance as long as its slope remains slightly negative.

You may cap gains, but you are accepting guaranteed 10-15% a month in premium.

February: Play retarded fucking plays I refuse to mention because I‚Äôm so ashamed of them, lose my ass

March-April: deposit more money, plays SPY FDs for a month... bring my portfolio to up 5% on the year. EDIT: Lol fucking cheat code buy calls at 1% dump and puts at ATH

May: Lol Spy trade flat and every time you play 0DTE just light money on fire. My shares were at least doing ok. Down 25% 
EDIT: SPY cheat code no longer valid.

June: Spy has given me PTSD decide to rotate into some long plays, do DD and decide on CLNE (in part because I saw it get ape interest and fucking emojis) say fuck it pull the trigger all in (sold out of biotech and pharm which was actually a good thing) Moons overnight back to even on the year for portfolio.

And here I am now in July: SPY is popping off and making people money. I‚Äôm down 50% bag holding $6 and $8 7/16 calls and shares of a stock. Need the stock to go to $11.20 to breakeven on all the calls and my average on shares is $11.80

I‚Äôm not moving anything today but fuck me I‚Äôm gonna use the long weekend to think about how retarded I am.

But whats gonna make us truly better:

1- experience/heartache . Every trader knows just what this means

2- account management. No longer aiming for the fences just concentrating at bats. Some of us

3- laws. A mechanical/scientific process to speculation backed with statistics more than opinions. Learn this yourself otherwise youre always gonna be stuck following other peoples trades.

#FAQ

#What does this mean?

The amount of cum (semen) on my phone and Reddit phone has increased by one.

#Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be worthy of cum. These include, but are not limited to:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†you being a femboy

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Spreading sti infections

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Sarcasm correctly flagged with a /s

#Am I banned from the Reddit?

No. But you should make comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to not cum.

#I don't believe my comment deserved a nut. Can you un-nut to it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a nut. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot your nut on me. I tend to respond to Being shot with nut within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of nut appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

#How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the nut and move on. your behavior will be nutted to on Reddit.com. I will continue to nut until you stop being so hot üò© Remember: I‚Äôm horny uwu"

2021-07-02 08:06:15,wallstreetbets,I just hope it doesn‚Äôt come on Saturday like it did before. I made a spread and sold 2 $705C 7/2 but have three $700C 7/2. So I‚Äôve capped my losses but I feel stupid because I could‚Äôve just yolod into SPY 429C and 430C. I bought one of each but should‚Äôve gone into it balls deep. This was my first full FD yolo since losing everything.

Canoo ($2b) is on par with Arrival ($10b) and Lucid ($60b), considering all three are engineering focused and will being manufacturing in the next year or so. Canoo has the best risk-to-reward ratio of the three, and can 5x-10x in the next year to match its peers."

2021-07-02 14:54:41,wallstreetbets,"I don't think the problem with the apes is even that their goal is to P&D.   They could sustain growth if they could get their heads on straight.

&#x200B;

The issue is they're too easily manipulated and too quick to pull out of something on the first red candle.  They don't mean to create pump and dumps, they just inadvertently do so with dumb actions.

Take CLNE for a great example.  Got beaten down all the way to like 7 in May, and people are asking me if my original June thesis of 13's printing was still viable, so I'm like ""well no, it's pretty much dead for June unless the apes got in on it, then it would have a chance"".  So some dude got their attention for 5 minutes and, sure enough, not only did that happen, but it looked like they were going to drive it all the way into the 20's on high volume.  That's sustaining growth.  They've proven the thesis that they can drive that price as far as they want. Like, none of them are even buying at bad prices at the levels it was at.

But the apes, individually, lack the money to be in more than like...2, maybe 3 plays at once.  And I'm looking at it like ""OK, but will they pull a Jamie Lannister and go back to their sister for no damned good reason in 20 minutes"".  Sure enough, some of them are like ""derp I made 10% on CLNE, time to sell and buy more movie theatres that are capped out"".  And then the ones who have no business having a trading account go into the daily and see a botnet spam Wendy's for...not even a day, like 3 hours, so they all pile into that (selling other assets to do so, causing those assets to go down, thus causing more of them to panic sell their assets, causing a feedback loop).  Then another botnet the next day pulls them over into $WISH.  And another one starts dragging them into some shitty biotech, etc.

&#x200B;

The apes don't turn something into a P&D.  It's just that when they make a move that actually makes smart money nervous or start to lose money, smart money is really adept at ticker spamming to push them into other one-day plays and creating P&D's out of the apes inability to see what's going on.  The argument, therefore, would be the people who manipualte them turn plays into P&D's."
2021-07-02 08:42:44,wallstreetbets,Yeah but the 195k estimate got replaced by a 203k estimate so now we might see reports that they missed expectations. I just need my FDs to hitüôèüèø

2021-07-02 12:50:29,wallstreetbets,"Retail doesn't have the volume to make this kind of push. 

And if smart money never bought at the highs then the market would never go up.

Its the same thing historically. There always a high that gets pushed through until the bubble bursts and it rinses and repeats. 

Reaching ATHs isn't something that stops smart money."

2021-07-02 16:40:14,wallstreetbets,"I certainly don't have the resources to look into these issues like it seems you do (and have done), but I've always suspected that the ticker spam and diamond hands mentality comes from inorganic sources that are looking to take advantage of the volatility.  I also dont think it's an accident that legit plays like CLNE and SOFI, where there is a real business plan that management is executing upon, get lumped in with the WISH and MVIS stuff.  I've been pretty amused to see accounts without much history here coming out of the woodwork to talk shit about SOFI all of a sudden.  

I dont disagree at all that it's not the apes' intention to P&D, and essentially what you said is what I was getting at.  They are entering plays without any conviction, driven there by spam.  The people who are serious about diamond hands or whatever are still stuck in their same GME and AMC plays, and they'll never get out.  The current ape gang that's out there in new tickers is a concentrated group of unaware idiots who couldn't follow through on the original plays and are just trying to chase whatever the spammers tell them to do, hopeful that they're catching a rocket and recreating the GME squeeze.  One day it's WISH, the next it's CLOV, and tomorrow it'll be WKHS again.  Every YOLO on the front page is some doofus jumping into a play he doesn't really understand with his entire net worth, and when he sees years of savings disappear in a few minutes, he bails.

So while they're not intending to P&D, they're doing it."

2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I‚Äôm Investing The Little Money I Have Into $RIG (transocean) Hello everybody, I thought I‚Äôd make a post explaining my decisions to invest 100% of my savings into $RIG! :)

I would make a YOLO post but amount is too small to be considered. I am currently in school to become a research analyst so money is tight.

*Some basic points towards company profile:

-$RIG is projected to hit above $5 per share next week!

-$RIG has seen close to $41 million in insider buying! (10 million shares)

-$RIG has a backlog of over $10 billion!! (Yes, with a B)

-$RIG survived when competitors declared bankruptcy (sure, they hit $.70 at one point but still better than going under)

-$RIG has a short interest of over 14% (short squeeze potential? Not sure.)

-$RIG has been going up  7, 8, 9% most days lately with room for higher values.

-Oil producers in Middle East (OPEC) JUST announced they are releasing far less oil than experts expected (meaning oil will continue to rise!) 

*Final Thought:

Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt trust a college student (lol) and full disclaimer that I DO own this stock, although my profit is growing and I thought I‚Äôd share. :)

Backlog is primarily due to COVID shutting down gas prices so rigs didn‚Äôt need to run at full capacity. Generally positive now that gas prices are rising. Crude oil barrels are only going up.

2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What‚Äôs your experience with ratio spreads? I‚Äôve been exclusively short options for a few years where I‚Äôve been running the wheel. I do most of my researching on options chains/options calculators entering random assortments of short/long options to see what types of profit zones are possible based on a few criteria; expiration dates, strikes, credit vs debit, IV, probability of profit, and trade management as well. I‚Äôve never been concerned with hitting home runs but more importantly how can I minimize risk while still being profitable. After all this time I‚Äôve come to prefer front ratio call spreads. I think the ability to guarantee yourself some type of credit to the downside and to have a breakeven which is several hundred percent to the upside gives you all the freedom you need to trade ratios and still have a chance to make a decent return on risk. For those of you trading ratio spreads out there, what‚Äôs your experience been and what management style do you have?"

2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD: AerCap Holdings ($AER) - The biggest jet leasing company in the world is buying the other biggest jet leasing company in the world. Greetings, and fuck you.

Congratulations for being one of the twelve people who will see this amidst the flood of all the valuable content submitted on a continual basis by our esteemed 5-month-old simian membership. We‚Äôre going to make some money, they‚Äôll keep hodling their dicks underneath the teetering lid of the cookie jar.

Disclaimer: Join me in this play, or don‚Äôt, I do not care. This is the part where I tell you that I‚Äôm not responsible for the decisions that you make with your life.

AerCap Holdings, Inc. is an aircraft leasing company based out of Dublin. They don‚Äôt make planes, they don‚Äôt fly planes. They just own planes, and they lease the shit out of them out to airlines around the globe. They do this a lot, and in fact they‚Äôre the largest jet leasing company in the world, both in terms of units and revenues.

And within the next 30 days they‚Äôre about to get a whole lot fucking bigger.

[I'm putting this here so that my thumbnail image isn't a table.](https://preview.redd.it/1ssi2tofhq871.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=31dd4620982396bd6ab051cb4fb4155017e694cc)

But before we get to that, let‚Äôs deal with the first question that‚Äôs on your mind.

**Is this a reopening play?**

The short answer is no, AER is already back to pre-pandemic levels.

While airlines are generally seen as a reopening play that has yet to fully recover, you can consider AerCap to be fully recovered at this point. AerCap doesn‚Äôt have direct exposure to demand for commercial flights, but rather to the ability of commercial airlines to service their lease obligations. For some time during the COVID pandemic, there were doubts over not only the airlines‚Äô ability to pay, but even over their ability to remain a going concern. AerCap, like banks and REIT‚Äôs all around the world, was forced to defer lease payments and restructure leases to accommodate the sudden disappearance of demand for air travel. While demand has been slow to come back, the airlines‚Äô confidence in a comeback has been strong enough to get them to tap into whatever liquidity they have to get themselves back on schedule with their lease payments.

Currently, AerCap has about a 98% utilization rate of its aircraft, and substantially all lease payments have resumed their normal pace. As of year end 2021, the business had totally recovered from an operating cash flow perspective (per the 4Q investor presentation):

https://preview.redd.it/y6kvbwskhq871.png?width=497&format=png&auto=webp&s=466407797da4858a678fcc902b3c37fbf51e4bed

Furthermore, CEO Angus Kelly, has repeatedly gone on record stating that confidence is strong that the global air travel industry will return to normal, as communicated to him by his customers, and as evidenced by the collection of lease payments. As for how that affects AerCap stock, air travel recovery to pre-pandemic levels has already been priced in.

**AerCap Holdings ‚Äì** ***what is it?***

This is an extremely well-managed, boring-ass business. As I mentioned, this is the largest commercial jet leasing company in the world.  They buy airplanes using debt, then they lease those airplanes to airlines and collect monthly lease payments.  Think of them like a REIT, but in the sky.

Their list of clients is really fucking long, including roughly 200 airlines in 80 different countries. Name an airline; [it is most likely a customer](https://www.aercap.com/our-business/our-customers/).

According to 3/31/2021 financials, the business controls about $42 Billion in assets, with $34.5 Billion of that being book value of aircraft. The aircraft consists of the following:

https://preview.redd.it/c7mlkpzaiq871.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=1422dbb32fa3388350436108b671cb329018d4d8

As of 3/31/2021 AerCap owned 931 aircraft and managed 105 aircraft, with commitments to purchase 285 new aircraft through 2027.  This table also shows average remaining lease term of 7.3 years.

&#x200B;

**Cash Flow:**

Normally this is the most important thing for me to consider, but on this deal I don‚Äôt find it all that pertinent. You‚Äôd be hard pressed to find a company with more stable cash flows year over year. Revenues between $4.5 Billion and $5 Billion, each year. Net income of right about $1 Billion, every year. 2020 was a shitty year, for reasons we all know and understand. As I touched on above, the existing business is back to normal as of this writing.

&#x200B;

*Ok, so why are we here?*

**The Big Fucking Deal:**

On March 10, AerCap announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with GE to acquire 100% of GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS). The deal is worth approximately $30 Billion.

# The EU Antitrust regulators are to make their decision on this merger by July 26th.  US DOJ has already approved the deal.  This is our catalyst.  I may have forgotten to put this information in the original post and it's kind of important so I'm sneaking it in with an edit.

That $30 Billion is buying a lot of fucking aircraft. [This article from 2018](https://www.mototok.com/blog/top-10-aircraft-leasing-companies) shows GECAS as the 5th largest jet leasing service in the world, however more recent articles from the date of the merger announcement in March say it's the second largest, behind only AerCap.  In either case, GECAS itself controls an additional 1,600 aircraft and helicopters (consisting of aircraft owned, serviced, and on order) and has a client list consisting of 200+ customers in 70 countries.

So this deal makes AerCap the lessor to just about every damn airline on the planet.  It is the world's biggest buyer of aircraft from Boeing and Airbus.  It is partnering with GE, which builds 70% of the world's narrow-body aircraft engines.

It also expands AerCap's business into a brand new operational territory.

Aside from being a commercial aircraft giant, GECAS owns an entity called Milestone, which is currently the world‚Äôs largest helicopter leasing company. [According to the website](https://www.gecas.aero/solutions/) ‚Äì *‚ÄúMilestone is the world‚Äôs leading helicopter lessor, with the largest civilian helicopter fleet and a suite of leasing and debt solutions. Milestone provides financing options to operators in the offshore oil & gas industries, search & rescue, EMS, police surveillance, mining, and other utility missions.‚Äù*

I could keep going but the point is this ‚Äì AerCap is going to be really freaking big.

&#x200B;

**bUt WhAt‚ÄôS tHe ShOrT iNtErEsT?**

Go fuck yourself. There isn‚Äôt any short interest. Maybe apologies are in order since this is a profitable and stable company, unlike all the shit you usually trade. But nobody out there is betting on this business going bankrupt. Everybody is long. Believe it or not it‚Äôs a good thing when the whole financial world doesn‚Äôt expect you to fall flat on your face.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5drdv5m2kq871.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=77405ff6e252c391505a24a8aa597812580569cb

Note, while this shows there are only 3 analyst targets within the past 3 months, I‚Äôm seeing on Webull that there are 9 analysts covering AER with an average target of $71.86 and the same high and low as represented above.

Point is, this company is undervalued without considering the acquisition.

&#x200B;

**Other Shit You Need To Know**

It‚Äôs not all rainbows and sunshine and unlimited upside. As with anything, there is a chance this wont be as super awesome as expected. Here‚Äôs some stuff to ruminate over before pulling the trigger on this play--

Share Dilution:

# THIS PART IS IMPORTANT

Part of the financing of the acquisition is going to come in the form of share issuance directly to GE.  AerCap will create 111.5 million shares, and deliver them to GE at the closing table, scheduled for some time in 4th Quarter 2021.    That's about $5.8 Billion in share value at today's prices.  Today, there are currently only 130 million shares outstanding, and AER has a market cap of $6.8 Billion.

However, with the acquisition, AerCap is adding roughly $9 Billion in Net Assets.  Here's a table prepared by Dhieren Bechai, the writer on Seeking Alpha who seems to know what the hell he's talking about:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1790vclomq871.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f1b357635fe99f2fa89a1d63b7ed049dd4efff3

Following the deal, GE will control about 46% of the combined company and will be entitled to nominate two directors to AerCap‚Äôs Board of Directors.

Possibility that the deal is not approved:

What if the EU decides not to approve the deal? Well I guess I‚Äôm fucked, then.

[Excerpt from this article:](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-antitrust-regulators-decide-aercaps-124450911.html)

""*The EU competition enforcer can approve the deal with or without concessions or it can open a four-month investigation if it has serious concerns.*

*Analysts said the scale of the combined entity, controlling about three times the number of aircraft as its nearest competitor, Dublin-based Avolon, could force AerCap to offload aircraft to meet antitrust demands.""*

&#x200B;

**So, what‚Äôs the play?**

[Zoom in, I dont know.  Or look it up yourself.](https://preview.redd.it/0lu16q13nq871.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d9079a1dbef1df529b52ed74a0619743147feb9)

Here‚Äôs the chart right now. It‚Äôs on a dip, and I consider the current price of $52 to be an excellent entry point.  I've been waiting for the price to die down to this level, and I finally started buying yesterday.  The upper end of the channel it‚Äôs been in is about $62.80, which is the pre-COVID high. I‚Äôm betting on it busting through the top of the channel if we get deal approval in July.

I‚Äôm also trying to stay a little conservative with my positioning.  If the deal does not get approved, AER should still bounce off the 200 EMA and get back in an uptrend with a positive earnings report and strong guidance in July (which it will be).

You can play this with shares obviously, and you might see the open interest on the calls and decide that‚Äôs a better plan. I have a few shares but those have been a long term hold for me.

As for me, I‚Äôm playing this with calls. As of right now, this is my position:

https://preview.redd.it/u2v5d4unnq871.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=b36045432a6ce7db5ed7a718966e33613cee1112

I am going to keep adding as long as the price stays down. I just started buying yesterday, and added more today.  I think that this $52 level is the floor, and I will keep adding as long as the price stays down below $55.

Again -- join me on this play, or don‚Äôt, I do not care."

2021-07-02 02:37:32,wallstreetbets,Very similar but this one operates out of multiple backyard sheds around the world.
2021-07-02 08:58:46,wallstreetbets,Can you think of anything to add or that I missed?  Would love to hear other opinions on this
2021-07-02 09:01:14,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah ü¶ãü¶ãüçÜ
2021-07-02 02:36:42,wallstreetbets,"I mean, that's a possibility.  But the further down it goes, the more of a screaming buy it is."
2021-07-02 09:00:10,wallstreetbets,Just provides different risk/reward.

gonna do some more research and set some cash aside. I lost money on the Activision play you suggested but it was my own fault for buying a shit expiry."
2021-07-02 03:36:30,wallstreetbets,That's all you had to say. I will probably jump in at open lol.
2021-07-02 08:58:57,wallstreetbets,I saw something I didn't like in here but the user is approved so I ignored it. /u/zjz
2021-07-02 12:40:11,wallstreetbets,"Ah shit, I hate when that happens.  I dont even remember saying anything about ATVI but I did play it briefly a few months ago.  Didn't work out, obviously. 

The one I felt really bad about was suggesting ASO right before it traded flat for two months. Worst possible timing.  Truthfully that was why I haven't written DD in a while, and why I had avoided writing about this one even though I've been following it closely."
2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"EVGO team rings morning bell on NASDAQ, tomorrow (July 2)--great short term and long term forecast! Hi folks,

Tomorrow, EVGO, joins the likes of Chargepoint and Blink. The EVGO leadership team will also be ringing the bell at market open on NASDAQ, which should generate quite a bit of investor interest. 

""To celebrate the milestone, members of EVgo, LS Power and CLII will ring the opening bell at the Nasdaq in New York on July 2, 2021.""

EVGO is the nation's largest public fast charging network, and I anticipate this company and stock to grow quickly over the next few months. Some of its partners include Tesla, GM, Ford, KIA, Hyundai and Nissan.

EVGO also recently hired an individual who worked for Bernie Sanders to lobby for them on the Hill. This company will surely be a candidate and benefit from federal support, including the upcoming infrastructure bill. 

I anticipate a near term price target of $22+. My EOY price target is $35+.

Very excited!

Anyone else bullish on EVGO or other EV charging stocks? Which ones and why?


Good luck!

2021-07-02 02:08:34,wallstreetbets,"Why would Tesla partner with them and wheres the proof of this partnership. All I see is that it can charge a Tesla if they want to pay the extra pricing... Not that I am against more EV infrastructure at all I just think this is not true and misleading.

I see no need to use this network at all as a Tesla owner for 3.5 years now. The Tesla supercharger network is amazing and there is no up charges on electric/charging costs unlike EVgo. Ive never had to use any charger besides Tesla supercharger or my home charger. 68k miles up and down the east coast. Maybe its different elsewhere."
2021-07-02 02:22:14,wallstreetbets,"EVGO has an up time and maintenance issue imo. Used the local stalls for routine charging on i3 for a few years and almost always had 1 or 4 out of service and their 175 kW stall never worked.  This was up to about a year ago.  They will need make some major improvements to further scale if they can't keep their current number of stations up and running.

Edit: should also note that I stopped using the EVGO since my free charging from dealer ended.  Never even thought to use it as a true paying customer."

""Oh it just dropped $3 a share in the last hour but that's a good thing because now it will bounce off this support line."" It's unreal.

2021-07-02 16:51:16,wallstreetbets,Lmao can‚Äôt argue with big brain logic with that. In the future know that derivatives control the price and that your buy and sell orders are most likely always sent to dark pools.
2021-07-02 17:36:34,wallstreetbets,"No, it's not. The short interest is very much within normal ranges for a very volatile stock. You guys just have so much confirmation bias going that you're living in an alternate reality."
2021-07-02 10:50:34,wallstreetbets,"Average days of shorts holding is over 30 days so there are some who have been shorting since under $10. Sure, others shorted it around $60 but they still have to buy shares back eventually."
2021-07-02 10:32:21,wallstreetbets,"Basically the only way out of shorting the stock is by purchasing the shares back. The short interest is around 1/5 of the free float (which is a lot), but most people understand that there are far more short positions than what‚Äôs reported. Currently the hedge funds are in deep üí© because it‚Äôs all on margin. Eventually they will be forced to buy back those shares‚Ä¶ from apes who refuse to sell."
2021-07-02 10:24:19,wallstreetbets,"According to ortex (ortex.com) SI was 18.94% on 6/28, and on 5/28 it was 17.65%."
2021-07-02 11:14:10,wallstreetbets,"Lol man do your DD on something before knocking it. AMC had a squeeze already, but Short interest is up, Naked shorts confirmed, retail owns the float, short volume is usually 30-60% of the days total volume -30B in Dark Pools, threshold list, shorts are being bled by the billions."

2021-07-02 17:23:13,wallstreetbets,"Yo, IDK dude I think I‚Äôm a whole lot more than kinda right. Care to explain or maybe your a little confused about what you think you know"

2021-07-02 11:49:37,wallstreetbets,"And...btw, thanks!"
2021-07-02 10:37:20,wallstreetbets,That short interest is not lower than it was a month ago‚Ä¶
2021-07-02 17:41:51,wallstreetbets,Let‚Äôs go punk learns me something. I can dance all day
2021-07-02 17:28:56,wallstreetbets,Derivatives partake in what causes fluctuations in the price but they don‚Äôt at all control it. And my buy and sell orders going into a dark pool‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs really no way to prove whether it does or doesn‚Äôt. When it would or wouldn‚Äôt. Depends on your brokerage and volume in the moment
2021-07-02 12:37:48,wallstreetbets,"My only advice to you is that if you're gonna follow other dummies for trades, don't trade more than you can afford to lose."
2021-07-02 17:52:50,wallstreetbets,"Are you saying that derivatives don‚Äôt control the price because you know this or because you are assuming this? Nobody that knows how the market works would ever say that lol. Actually the head of the NYSE just recently confirmed this and there‚Äôs a video out there of ole Jim Cramer explaining exactly how hedge fund managers use derivatives to tank the prices of stocks in order to meet their weekly goals. 

Well if over half of all orders never make it to the market and almost all brokers that aren‚Äôt fidelity or vanguard make most of their commissions off of routing their orders through market makers who take the other side of your position so that your order gets negated then I would say that it is highly likely that your orders never made it to the market. This can be confirmed by ether checking what exchanges your broker uses or bumpy just checking your order details and seeing what exchange your order was executed on‚Ä¶ easily comfortable. 

Idk why your calling me a punk but good luck out there. Your gonna need it lol"
2021-07-02 16:31:29,wallstreetbets,"I'm amazed i've put the little I have in, i am very risk averse. Really, just curious about the whole thing, and wouldn't mind getting a small pile that would pay off a credit card or two. So, yeh, thanks for stating the obvious that is not so obvious to many... ;)"
2021-07-02 18:15:35,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm saying this because that‚Äôs what some idiot on another forum told me obviously. But on a more serious note‚Ä¶ That is price fluctuation it‚Äôs not what sets the price initially. Which is what I meant by it doesn‚Äôt control it it‚Äôs a factor in the fluctuation. 

The dark pool isn‚Äôt for hiding the fact that orders were made or to give anyone insight‚Ä¶ In the long run. It‚Äôs just so massive orders can get processed at the price they were contracted

2021-07-02 18:49:24,wallstreetbets,Dark pools were fundamentally designed for large orders but the average order size on dark pools from PFOF brokers is $1. This was said in the third senate committee on the GME saga. Lol I‚Äôm glad you feel lucky because today‚Äôs your lucky day. Take this award

2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Strategists: 11% S&P 500 Correction Coming in 2nd Half, 2 Catalysts KEY CATALYSTS:

\-- the U.S. PMI Manufacturing Index fading faster than expected in the second half of the year, and  
\-- the U.S. dollar strengthening.

Short excerpt from Marketwatch 

Our **call of the day**, from strategists Barry B. Bannister and Thomas R. Carroll at the equity trading desk of investment bank Stifel, is that the S&P 500 is heading for an 11%.

The ‚Äúrecovery trade‚Äù that has defined the recent bull market is headed for a further correction in the second half of 2021, the strategists said. Cyclical stocks‚Äîindustrials, energy, materials, financials, tech, and discretionary‚Äîwill fall relative to defensive stocks like staples, healthcare, utilities, and real estate, Bannister and Carroll said.

This will weigh down the S&P 500, and Stifel‚Äôs strategists say that the blue-chip index is heading for an 11% drop to 3,800 points.

The likely catalysts for this major shift, according to the team at the investment bank, are the U.S. PMI Manufacturing Index fading faster than expected in the second half of the year, and the dollar strengthening.

Bannister and Carroll said the primary causes are a slowing global money supply in U.S. dollar terms‚Äîas central banks ease pandemic-era supports‚Äîas well as distortions from quantitative easing, and the lagged effect of China‚Äôs policy tightening.

A sea change of this magnitude will create distinctive winners and losers, the strategists said. Investors can prepare by buying shares in companies focused on defensive industries: pharma and biotech; food and staples retailing; commercial and professional services; food, beverage, and tobacco; utilities; healthcare equipment and services; household products; consumer services; and telecommunications.

2021-07-02 01:43:45,wallstreetbets,I definitely can see the possibility of a huge correction coming but experts have been saying a correction is coming since this time last year. Might as well take advantage of the bull market while we can

r/agedlikemilk"
2021-07-02 02:14:53,wallstreetbets,Question is will it be a violent correction or a slow bleed.
2021-07-02 19:27:27,wallstreetbets,Oh. No. Not another 10% dip to buy‚Ä¶
2021-07-02 02:04:01,wallstreetbets,Gonna dip much lower than 11%
2021-07-02 11:07:45,wallstreetbets,"I'd rather buy SPY LEAPs when the crash happens as that seems like guaranteed money.

Bears don't know when the crash will happen, but bulls know the crash won't last forever."
2021-07-02 13:43:35,wallstreetbets,Energy is going down? Literally all the oil predictions are 80 dollars. Some 100 per barrel. It's like 5 year since we saw anywhere near that. Dang chicken licken
2021-07-02 14:48:25,wallstreetbets,So buy stonks like $VIAC that have already taken a massive hit and are unlikely to be impacted by a drop in manufacturing.  Keep 20% cash and don‚Äôt try to time the market.  Got it.
2021-07-02 04:01:31,wallstreetbets,"That is what call options on the VIX are for. I am keep playing Bullish, buying more Singularity-type ETF for long-term etc. While holding as far out leaps as possible on VIX just in case there is a 11% correction I am making bank on the hedge."
2021-07-02 02:22:49,wallstreetbets,Almost like people agree and disagree on a topic

2021-07-02 13:30:06,wallstreetbets,"11% correction would not mean ""sky is falling"", it would mean more people getting discount, it would be fairer market for everyone, and it would ensure further gains, better gains."
2021-07-02 13:32:48,wallstreetbets,"Well, it's only 11% so I would say, slow bleed few weeks, and then we'll be back to normal sooner than later."
2021-07-02 08:42:35,wallstreetbets,Stocks only go up
2021-07-02 13:33:46,wallstreetbets,"If you think it will dip much lower, then When and Why (the catalyst)?"
2021-07-02 13:28:52,wallstreetbets,You mean Cash Secured Put?

He didn‚Äôt get it."
2021-07-02 05:22:55,wallstreetbets,That sounds like a good plan. I only really did VIX calls during the big crash last March but it printed
2021-07-02 19:49:04,wallstreetbets,Does the VIX go up when the S&P goes down?
2021-07-02 02:24:44,wallstreetbets,Its one thing to agree/disagree. But in investing if you believe something you put your money where that opinion is. IF youre sure a crash is coming you short SPY. And those bears have consistently lost money since this time last year
2021-07-02 13:32:17,wallstreetbets,"Well, you   can e short options and make money. For example, Cash Secured Put is a great way to collect a little bit premium with the goal of getting assigned and purchasing equities at a price that you (and I) like."
2021-07-02 19:49:50,wallstreetbets,How will we know when they‚Äôre not üòÖ
2021-07-02 13:35:22,wallstreetbets,That's a heck of a üåàüêª explanation for why a downturn is postive....   Good luck with your negative returns.
2021-07-02 09:20:04,wallstreetbets,StoNks only go up. R&P 30 (retard and poor 30) consisting of 30 most liked stonks has a over 9000 upside potential.
2021-07-02 04:12:59,wallstreetbets,"Lol nobody was short time time last year we were in the midst of an economic recovery, people have only been largely short spy the past few months but shit is really starting to hit the fan the past few weeks"
2021-07-02 13:41:51,wallstreetbets,"Lol yeah there are more conservative ways to actually make money. 

But this is WSB: buy high, sell low (or in the case of puts, the inverse), post loss porn haha

I will admit I have a limit order open for SPY puts today as a hedge that hasn‚Äôt filled yet and probably won‚Äôt, I have a feeling with no objective reason to say why that Tuesday morning is going to open down which would be unfortunate for my calls"
2021-07-02 05:18:51,wallstreetbets,Uh yes they were lol. I don't know how long you've been here but a lot of people here were still shorting spy and there was big talk of another crash coming
2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,$AMC 4 contracts remaining. Sell or Hold?

On a big spike write calls and sell to other retards and take their money. Theta gang that shit and milk it till you're seriously done with them and then sell.

Sell four, secure profits. Congrats on the 1,100%x4.

Sell two, keep two. Secure profits on two of them, hold the other two so you don't fomo gains.

Keep four, PMCC that shit and print money. You've bought an ATM, for stupid cheap, that when used correctly will pay for itself in 4 weeks or less, and you own it until 2023."
2021-07-02 17:03:50,wallstreetbets,Sell 3 and keep one just to ride it out all the way
2021-07-02 11:38:36,wallstreetbets,Sell
2021-07-02 06:08:54,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôd probably look at dumping those today.  Either during the pm spike or after the morning drop & rise

2021-07-02 12:40:05,wallstreetbets,"Sell, buy clov üçÄ"
2021-07-02 16:25:26,wallstreetbets,"Just do some basic analysis. The price was sitting at \~10 dollars for a while, and then shot up to 50 dollars. That's a 500% increase. Every 1 dollar it moves, you make about 400 dollars. The thing about stocks though is increases are exponential, not linear. In other words, to move 500% from 10 to 50 took about 20 billion dollars, but to move 500% again, it would take 225 billion dollars. That means the likelyhood of this happening is very low. Remember, prices are not objective markers in space. GME going to 500 dollars did not even take 100 billion, it was only valued around 60 at that price and it only lasted for a few seconds. 

If you honestly think a struggling movie company that was on the decline even before Covid is going to be worth more than AMD, a successful processor manufacture who is helping massive corporations like Google and Amazon shape the modern world, then by all means, stay in for the return. But realistically how much more do you think you are going to get out of this? You made 20 grand. To get another 20 grand you need to risk probably losing at least 15 grand over time minimum. You can put a stop loss and let it ride but that has it's own associated risk. You can also do as other suggest here and sell calls against these but that also has a downside risk. 

You can try to eek out a few extra thousand by selling to close at a different strike and turning it into a fixed trade, where you stand to for example make an extra xxxk but also lose that much and no matter what you secure some amount of it, but honestly because you are here asking this question in the first place

&#x200B;

Stop being fucking retarded and take the 20 grand."
2021-07-02 09:49:32,wallstreetbets,Play it safe and sell. Last time I screenshot my AMC gains I didn‚Äôt sell and lost half my returns the next day.
2021-07-02 09:04:12,wallstreetbets,Exercise 2 get your 200 shares --> right covered calls on OTM Weeklies for more $$ -->gets called away at 70$? still just made 65$ profit x 200 + premium. Hold the other two till your first 200 shares gets called away if it expires OTM rinse and repeat to next week.
2021-07-02 03:50:43,wallstreetbets,I'd sell 2 and hold 2.
2021-07-02 02:51:45,wallstreetbets,Watch a random movie at AMC if it‚Äôs good hold

2021-07-02 07:13:33,wallstreetbets,IDE give it another week.  They will have some FTD they need to cover.  Typically Monday and Tuesday we go up
2021-07-02 01:12:39,wallstreetbets,I would hold. AMC still has a large reported short interest; it could pop some more in next few months.

2021-07-02 03:32:17,wallstreetbets,I made another comment on writing calls against it after I noticed they were leaps.
2021-07-02 10:12:35,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs basically a covered call, but instead of owning shares you own LEAPS which are high delta with far out expiry date. LEAPS have quite high premiums tho"
2021-07-02 03:09:28,wallstreetbets,"Options are difficult to eli5 but I'll give it a shot. Assuming you know the basics already.

1 contract =100 shares

Owning a deep itm Leap = Owning 100 shares in the eyes of a broker.

Covered call: Writing/selling/short an option where you already own the 100 shares. So if you bought 100 shares of XYZ at $7.50 then write a Call with a $10 strike but the stock moons to $35. You are not on the hook to then buy 100 shares at market price($35+) only to then have them called away at $10(strike of the option you wrote) resulting in a $25+/sh loss because you already owned the 100 shares.

So owning a deep in the money leap they will allow you to use the ownership of that option as collateral to sell a covered call just the same as if you owned 100 shares outright.

OP has 4 contracts or control of 400 shares. Meaning they can write 4 call options for an out of the money strike, let's say the 7/16 $62 strike. And collect minimum $1,600(4x$400), and that's on a low IV day. Repeat as necessary on weekly, bi weekly, or monthly options and start collecting. No worries about them expiring itm(should OP choose not to roll them otm) because even if they are called away at $75, OP can exercise their leap and buy them for $5."
2021-07-02 11:38:32,wallstreetbets,"$18,000?  I have a very high paying job I just do this for fun, I ain‚Äôt trying to get rich off of stocks I have a job for that. But thank you for trying to guarantee something you have absolutely no clue about. üëçüèΩ"
2021-07-02 03:14:07,wallstreetbets,Oh damn that makes sense thank you!
2021-07-02 03:20:45,wallstreetbets,"That was just the eli5 on the theory, now if you do some math you'll realize that there are 81 weeks until 20Jan2023. With proper timing and management those writes could generate $1,000-$1,500/week or more. Not saying AMC will or will not be in it's current state 81 weeks from now, but you get the idea."
2021-07-02 03:35:02,wallstreetbets,"I learned something today, and I thank you for that. Now if I could just understand and see it in action, then I'll fully understand lol"

2021-07-02 01:01:29,wallstreetbets,"I 'member when the TPPA was going to have an international decision making, psuedo judical body drawn from major coporations. If individual voters vote for governments worldwide and a minimum corp tax is agreed, great.

But generally floors and ceilings come with massive macro-economic consequences. The current problem of coporate subsidies, exclusive government contracts, charity and religious loop holes, lack of enforcement of existing laws won't change. 

Seems like a token gesture to appease voters without delivering substance. Because if Company A pays $50 billion in taxes; but the Govt pays them $100 Billion to not fail, to stay in a state/city or have a consumer price slightly lower, nothing will change.

I really doubt this will be market moving. Bunch of voters getting duped in the short term won't affect global markets.

Rigs are spread across different countries where heat is relatively low as well as energy cost, which means maximum efficiency with lower expenses.

Microsoft pissed me off because I told them prior their search is garbage, and you can not search for HTTPS traffic.  Still to my knowledge doesn't.  But, I haven't looked at in the past year. 

FireEye, was easily the winner if you have a knowledgeable team. Their Intel is the best.  But, console is a bit rough around the edges.  Who knows how that is going to play out now they sold FireEye.  Only thing that really pisses me off is they use BitDefender for their regular AV signatures.

Bitdefender is good for smaller deployments, but seems a nightmare in a large enterprise, but they are all good in their own ways.  If we could get over the resource utilizaion, that would be nice.  No getting around that, they are all hogs.  I just think it's a good thing to jump into long term, that's all.  S1 is taking everything i throw at it and spitting it out.

* What does this mean? Chinese steel will disappear off the market.
* Steel stocks in Taiwanese have already seen a steep increase in stock price within the past five days with some increasing by 40-50%
* China Steel Corp increased by 118% from 18.35 to 40 in a matter of 3 months.
* When the news comes in, you bet that U.S. steel stocks will skyrocket. What company is best poised to benefit? $CLF

# $CLF

**In 2008** when steel prices were at an all time high at the time at an average of about 900$ per ton, **$CLF reached 119$**. Right now, steel is selling for 1800$ per ton, and what is $CLF sitting at? A measly 22$. With the new CEO who was transformed the company into a cash cow milking machine, $CLF is the most undervalued stock in the stock market. The CEO Lourenco Goncalves has stated his intent to use the free cash flow from the company to pay off the debt of the company and focus on the shareholders of the stock. **I could easily see this stock doubling or tripling within the next few months.** With talks of Biden's infrastructure plan going on, all the attention is starting to shift to commodities and steel. 

&#x200B;

Positions: CLF 25$ 1/21/22 calls.

With an infrastructure bill proposal floating around I suspect the politicians will push something through eventually and use American steel to supply the projects. From what I‚Äôve gathered not only did the previous administration make it difficult to purchase foreign steel but China is set to increase the tariffs on their steel exports 10-25%. I really like this stock.

2021-07-02 09:37:55,wallstreetbets,"China is currently trying to keep all steel produced in China, in the country. I believe this is due to a large workload in domestic construction and engineering projects. 

They used to offer some mills a 15% rebate on exported products, but that rebate was canceled earlier in the year. So no rebate, plus an increase in raw material cost, plus an increase in shipping costs, means that we've already seen an increase in steel prices of 30 - 40% so far this year. 

Now it looks like they're going to up the ante even further by penalising mills exporting product with additional taxes, encouraging mills to supply the domestic market over the international market. This means more and more steel production is happening outside of China to meet the growing demand. With less price competition than previously experienced from the Chinese market.

Chinese Communist Party: ‚Äúoh very good, crush their domestic steel. Depend on China! We‚Äôll give you $130/ton back. Good work.‚Äù
CSS: ‚Äúsweet, can have even better edge now. Next tons gonna be $900.‚Äù

That rebate is gone now. Steel is short worldwide. Now they‚Äôre putting in a tax.

CCP: ‚Äúwe need metal. Export tax: pay us $150 tax/ton.‚Äù

This sort of applies to MT since they mine just under half their ore needs, but CLF entirely mines their own and produces excess to supply other steelmakers. This more gives it a possible advantage in terms of room to run over say scrap recyclers like NUE, although all steel producers would benefit greatly from a Chinese export tax largely because of the policy shift.

CLF is a particular darling because of the baller CEO's commitment to buying back shares, crushing shorts, and generally sticking it to the market. Also balance sheet blah blah managament blah ta garbage"
2021-07-02 12:21:18,wallstreetbets,"CLF  has the strongest position out of all the steel producers now. The reason being timing/luck, their acquisition of MT‚Äôs US operations and the opening of the HBI facility both of which took several years.

Also during last earnings call, the CEO laid out plans on reducing their debt portfolio into 2022 without refinancing.

Debt to equity ratio has nothing to do with whether their assets cover their debts. It's literally in the name. DEBT to EQUITY ratio. Meaning, how much money are they using from DEBT(borrowing money via loans), vs using EQUITY(raising money from shareholders).

DEBT to ASSET ratio however is a different story, and it is currently around 80%. So if they wanted to sell everything, they would have 20% of their assets left."

2021-07-02 07:23:57,wallstreetbets,"Please tell me how it‚Äôs sus. 

You think it‚Äôs sus because people are defending OP. What you probably don‚Äôt realize is, CLF was a banned ticker here and said to be a pump and dump from mods at WSB. First off, WSB as much as I joined Reddit for WSB and enjoy the sub, has no room to call any other investing sub a pump and dump, even more so, CLF when they have legit numbers to back up their  attention. This all boils down to a former WSB member (I think he was a mod) that they banished for his thesis on steel which has been coming true. But then when it was picked up by other people they kept saying pump and dump because they failed to do their DD themselves to figure out that CLF is up like 300% since last year, steel futures are at ridiculously high prices and futures are high so far out that this company will turn into a fucking cash printing machine. And instead of posting to say they were wrong, the mods just stopped banning the ticker and tried to fly under the radar because so many people are now interested in making money in a legit company that is primed and ready for a massive increase in stock price over the near and long term

Edit- also I think people are more willing to defend CLF not necessarily OP. Defending OP is easy because his account age and history but there‚Äôs also plenty of P&D comments about CLF. I will gladly defend it because I‚Äôve already made money on it and I want others here to make money on what is turning out to be one of the safest plays to come across WSB (outside of FDs, playing the channel with stock and long term options with this one- FDs only if you‚Äôre getting close to the next peak but timing that is gonna be hard with such short dates options)"
2021-07-02 01:29:55,wallstreetbets,"Further information here. If you buy high delta ITM leaps .80-.90 delta, you leverage your position. Basically when you have a high delta, your position moves similarly to the actual stock but for a fraction of the cost of buying the stock outright. It can give you great leveraged exposure to a stock your bullish on. CLF is probably the safest stock in the entire market to do this with right now IMO.

He's talked specifically about how paying off debt to increase valuation is his number one goal. If HRC keeps trading well above 1000 (spoiler alert, it will) they could theoretically do it by next year. 

That's not even mentioning the impact of the covid supply chain disruption massively inflating shipping costs. Some buyers from January are still waiting for their orders, and buyers are ordering a year out at ""fuck you, pay me"" prices. 

The real kicker is the rumored Chinese steel export tax that sent the Taiwanese market rotating massively out of tech and into materials this week, with steel leading the way...

2021-07-02 01:27:49,wallstreetbets,"That's precisely the point.

The goods they sell have gone up about 70% since then, while their costs haven't changed. That makes eps grow much more than 70%. Q1 had 500mm adjusted ebitda, Q2 will have at least 1.3 billion according to the 3rd earnings guidance update they've issued this quarter - and running the price steel's actually selling at with how much they produce, they'll beat that too.

They also paid off 400mm of notes 4 in May."

2021-07-02 01:44:53,wallstreetbets,You clearly know nothing about steel futures. They hit that price in 2008 when steel was trading at an all time high of $900 per ton. Today futures are over $1800. So use that useless space between your ears to come up with the logic as to why they will be a massive cash cow. Btw- steel futures are $1100+ through THE ENTIRETY OF 2022. This company will be bringing in massive cash for a very long time
2021-07-02 00:37:14,wallstreetbets,They do not have the necessary information pepelaugh

2021-07-02 02:54:18,wallstreetbets,"Interesting, so what strike price did you buy?"
2021-07-02 05:53:33,wallstreetbets,And leaps?
2021-07-02 09:25:42,wallstreetbets,Yeah.  Iduno if going all in is a good idea
2021-07-02 10:16:52,wallstreetbets,"This was my GME. I invested $6k after it was already in triple digits, sold about 30 shares when it was over $200, and had another 20 or so shares leftover. I just sell chunks more at a time as it hits peaks, and with those profits, buy the dips. Even if GME got delisted I'd have a net gain on the stock.

And also u/PowerOfTenTigers, you can set limit sells or trailing orders so that where you are pleased by the gains made you can dip out. Few can time the peak itself, but after you've made 30% profit, putting in a 15% trailing stop order good for 90 or 180 days will almost assure you win . Only if the price tanks after hours could you be screwed."
2021-07-02 10:43:48,wallstreetbets,"Ok, but you saying ""earnings are up 1200% over 2020"" is still bullshit, if they had negative earnings..."
2021-07-02 04:37:20,wallstreetbets,This ^
2021-07-02 08:31:20,wallstreetbets,Huh? Its the latest Q1-21 report
2021-07-02 12:14:13,wallstreetbets,"Let me rephrase that as a question. Without those costs would they have had a profitable or flat year?
In a overall bad year."
2021-07-02 08:34:41,wallstreetbets,"Do you think you're the only person that can look at the price of steel futures? Do you think that's some hidden info lmao?

Do you really think that you have some edge over the market because you looked at steel futures from 13 years ago and now? And now you're an expert on steel futures

Holy shit dude u shud be a fuckin quant with those skills. You could prolly get a job at Goldman's trading desk with sweet analysis like that. I assume your advanced level analysis skills have given you gigantic gains. Right??"
2021-07-02 05:27:38,wallstreetbets,Personally bought at 28 and sold at 31.5 to buy more CLF. MT will be 40 EOY but shit it moves slow as fuck.
2021-07-02 07:14:44,wallstreetbets,When I bought back in I bought in with ATM October calls and more recently dumped money into deep OTM august calls to scalp
2021-07-02 09:47:39,wallstreetbets,Gotta do what is right for you & lets you sleep at night! üëç
2021-07-02 10:34:10,wallstreetbets,"and you've got a moderate amount of money there. i did it with $200 and bought partials at $80 and $160, then sold at $320 to cover and held the rest for awhile as it rode up and down.

u/PowerOfTenTigers the thing you have to understand is that you almost certainly won't get rich off shares. sharemarkets trend upwards, so they're moneymakers, but slowly. options are the get rich ones, and they're just gambling.

even if your investment in GME started when the price was $4 with a $1000 buy in, and you sold at $300, you'd only have $75000. is it a lot? yeah. is it enough to retire on? no. you probably can't even buy a house with it unless you live rurally or in a small town. 

you need to have a lot of money to be one of the huge returns posts, and you need to remember that because otherwise you'll sit there saying ""just a few more dollars"" hoping for more profit and suddenly it'll drop."
2021-07-02 19:41:25,wallstreetbets,"So if you had earnings of (making up numbers here) -$100MM last year and this year you expect to be at $0, you don‚Äôt see how that would be an increase in earnings? And if you expected to be at +$100MM, that would be a 200% increase? Businesses sometimes have negative earnings. Especially after covid and ALSO after acquiring two major players in the industry."
2021-07-02 09:09:09,wallstreetbets,"And what are estimates for July's earnings reports? Congrats, you did DD on the share price a year ago"
2021-07-02 10:32:01,wallstreetbets,"No. But I have common sense which is. If you‚Äôre the biggest steel producer in North America, and the only one that is verticality integrated (because they mine their own iron ore and iron is hitting all time highs as well) that means even more profit. So if you have a company with a market cap of 10 billion and they are projecting $10 billion in cash flow in 2022 they are obviously extremely undervalued. So no. I‚Äôm not an expert, I‚Äôm just not a fucking idiot. You should try not being dumb, it will do your portfolio a world of good."
2021-07-02 05:28:37,wallstreetbets,"Agree

I'm going to sell after ER"
2021-07-02 12:29:00,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm waiting for another one of those 100 baggers where a 1 cent option turns into a 1 dollar option over night. I've got $1000 saved for that.
2021-07-02 10:46:04,wallstreetbets,"All this confidence, when I'm just gonna go ahead and guarantee my portfolio is far larger than yours. Idk if I should be taking your advice on its health.

I'm sure your ""common sense"" is gonna be the edge you need to outperform the market.

Even if you win this gamble youl just lose it immediately on the next one. Godspeed.

If you got balls youl post positions with a remindme. You can come back and gloat when it shoots up"
2021-07-02 10:58:57,wallstreetbets,"This isn‚Äôt a gamble. CLF isn‚Äôt a memestock. It just happened to unfortunately get picked up by WSB. I don‚Äôt play into the memestock gambling so I definitely won‚Äôt be ‚Äúlosing it on the next one‚Äù

FDs aren‚Äôt my style. I prefer safe investments. That being said I‚Äôd gladly back up the steel thesis on WSB to help as many people as I can make some cash. God knows they need it after the bag-holding that happens on this sub"
2021-07-02 11:00:54,wallstreetbets,So you own shares or calls?
2021-07-02 11:31:33,wallstreetbets,"Both. Started with leaps. Sold for profit. While I owned leaps I day traded and swing traded shares playing the channel. Right now mostly calls  all longer dated which I will be unloading on the next run up unless we break out of the channel CLF is trading in. After unloading those Calls my plan is to either buy puts or short the stock (again depending on where we sit with resistance levels and if it stays in the channel). So basically. Breakout- go long stock, sell options against it waiting for price discovery and new support levels.
Stay in the channel- keep playing the channel, profit when it goes up, profit when it comes down."
2021-07-02 11:35:58,wallstreetbets,And none of that sounds like gambling to you?
2021-07-02 11:38:53,wallstreetbets,"Do you consider day trading gambling. Do you consider buying calls gambling. Do you consider shorting a gamble and if so, why?"
2021-07-02 11:53:13,wallstreetbets,"Day trading - depends
Buying calls - not inherently

Buying calls cause you think the stock will explode, then selling them when stock rises, then shorting the same stock, then going long that stock after it falls to where you thought - yes"
2021-07-02 11:58:08,wallstreetbets,"You clearly don‚Äôt know what playing a channel means. CLF has been in a clearly defined channel for 6 months now

Edit- I don‚Äôt think the stock will ‚Äúexplode‚Äù that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt have FDs

Edit 2. It‚Äôs called taking advantage of the expansion and consolidation of the stock. You really need to learn what you‚Äôre talking about before trying to argue a point with someone. 

Edit 3- my plan after selling my calls is 100% based on where CLF finds resistance or new support. You‚Äôre lack of understanding fundamentals is really shining through. Put your ego aside, stop trolling and you might learn a thing or 2 to benefit you"
2021-07-02 12:14:11,wallstreetbets,"You intrigued me so I looked at your post history.

What happened to your amc call? Wasn't amc trading in defined ranges of 8-14?  You were just as confident amc would still in a defined trading range. What happened there? Thought you were an expert.

God you're a fucking retard. Amazing how you're so confident after being so wrong."
2021-07-02 12:17:19,wallstreetbets,"I didn‚Äôt own amc calls there champ

You have a comprehension deficit"
2021-07-02 12:20:20,wallstreetbets,"Direct quote ""View this however you will but I see that range between $8-$14 per share"".
47 days ago.

Don't worry, you were only off by 400% within like a week. Jesus that is DOGSHIT

Holy shit just checked and it was literally within 5 days. Got a real warren buffet over here"
2021-07-02 12:32:53,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs a memestock, what‚Äôs your point. If I would have entered my position it still would have been profitable you dumb fuck

That was a question posed to thetagang on a theory as a way to short the stock without have the massive exposure of shorting.

The sad part is you think that 400% increase is justified or maintainable. All things come to an end"
2021-07-02 12:36:04,wallstreetbets,"My point is that literally one month ago you were confident in the defined range of a stock. You were proved wrong in a comical fashion. Now you are just as confident you're gonna play the pricing of clf.

Lolololol whatcha got to say for recommending selling amc calls if it gets to 14 less than a week before its 400% gain?

Cant believe you said put your ego aside and learn something lmfao. 

Please let me know if you come up with some other inventive ways to burn money. Always looking to learn from experts like you."
2021-07-02 12:39:01,wallstreetbets,"The difference here is amc is a memestock and CLF isn‚Äôt. If you think CLF is a memestock you need to check who actually owns it. And again, it was a question posed to a options subreddit. Ego has nothing to do with it when your looking for people to punch holes in your theory"
2021-07-02 12:41:05,wallstreetbets,"And again- you still have trouble comprehending considering I just told you that position would have been profitable regardless of it running up and you said I burn cash. Well no, making any profit is not burning cash there sport. But nice try"
2021-07-02 12:44:31,wallstreetbets,"I also like how you deleted your options question post to make yourself look smarter. Don‚Äôt think I didn‚Äôt see it. Nice cover when creeping on my account. Just remember, only 1 of us is hiding post to make themselves look smarter and that‚Äôs usually because you don‚Äôt have a leg to stand on in a disagreement. This is the part where I‚Äôll say. Sure you‚Äôre right. 100%. Now you done trolling? Deleting your posts so someone can‚Äôt shove it in your face won‚Äôt do you any good. Good luck with your investments there bud. I wish you nothing but the best"
2021-07-02 13:01:30,wallstreetbets,"My options posts had no positions or companies projections, it was all theoretical examples trying to edge out an extra 1% while buying for long term.

Every once in a while I delete comments or posts that either didn't receive responses, might give some personal info, or had mistakes in spelling/title. Going through and seeing your retardation was a reminder to do it while I'm bored at work. I would certainly never give anyone any options advice, the ego that would be needed to be confident doing that is far beyond me.

Seems like you didnt even lose money on that one. But if you go on here and say shit like ""put your ego aside and learn"" as if your little channel chart analysis is infallible you should expect someone to call you out.

Only one of us is telling the other that clf is an obvious play and that anyone using their brain would see it. All im doing is pointing out you've had similar confidence before and been wrong. Im making no claims about my own expertise."
2021-07-02 14:19:40,wallstreetbets,"Seems like I didn‚Äôt lose money? I didn‚Äôt own the stock. And my strategy still would have been massive profit you dipshit. The theory was, own the stock, when it pops off, sell an ITM call against your shares if you think it‚Äôs gonna come back down. So if I owned 100 shares and waited for it to hit even $40, you do realize the amount of money I‚Äôd get selling deep ITM call would be close to $4,000 in premium. Right there that method would have almost 4x your money. Yeah you would have missed out on some extra cash but who gives a fuck. You don‚Äôt go broke taking profits. Now fuck outta here with your nonsense. Yeah you wouldn‚Äôt give advice because you had to ask basic questions about entering a position with a put even though you said covered call. Even that theory has flaws. What happens when you sell a put on a $20 stock and it plummets to $10? You‚Äôll be paying double for shares that would have otherwise been purchased for $10. Yeah, so go ahead and pick apart 1 piece of my theory which was the range it WAS trading in. Again it‚Äôs a memestock so that range is not set in stone. Regardless the process would have worked, I just didn‚Äôt own the stock at the time"
2021-07-02 14:39:39,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you didn't lose money, and btw its not like I made any on amc. I'm not in on that shit.

Point was there was another ""range"" you thought was defined and you could play. And were wrong. No range is set in stone.

Yeah thats the main reason I deleted the post. I wrote covered calls in title but was asking about a using atm puts to enter long term positions at a very slight discount. So the title didn't match the contents. Did have an edit explaining but just decided to delete. And yuh thats why I was asking about the downsides

Btw I still haven't got a downside. There are 2 options. Either I buy 100 shares today or sell a put nearly atm for premium. Price plummeting won't matter, id have purchased at that price either way.

The theory"
2021-07-02 14:44:05,wallstreetbets,Range vs channel. They are similar but not the same. That‚Äôs why my next move is dependent upon where the stocks move in the channel or out of it for that matter. Channels are real. You‚Äôre comparing apples to oranges when you mention my range I noted about amc
2021-07-02 14:54:19,wallstreetbets,"First to admit I know next to nothing about TA, cause I think its all trash. But your range and channel thingies are at least comparable lol

Do you not worry that you have identified an undervalued company with great prospects, and that you are correct that there will be a demand supercycle, but you'll miss the majority of it fiddling around on your charts trying to predict which way it will go?"
2021-07-02 15:07:12,wallstreetbets,"A channel is more so a moving range. This is my biggest worry. The next run up, it‚Äôs breaks through resistance and everyone on WSB jumps on board after I sell my calls. But that‚Äôs my own fault because I went with options and eventually they will expire. I would rather lock in my profits then take any loss. That being said. If that‚Äôs the case I will end up selling atm puts. If it climbs fast enough, close early for a profit. Or just end up. Buying the stock, buying a small position on margin and selling slightly ITM calls on the margin shares to lock in small gains and give me some wiggle room as a hedge if it retracts. I don‚Äôt have a set strategy with CLF and it‚Äôs constantly changing. WSB is a major variable in it because there‚Äôs so much institutional ownership in CLF which doesn‚Äôt change as fast as retail. And if WSB starts pumping options idk where it can take the stock price. It‚Äôs not a memestock but it can definitely be played as a memestock. This play is going to be a constant watch and adjust. Best case scenario would be a major influx of options buying from WSB before my calls are sold. If this stock saw a $10-$20 per share jump, I will be sitting on some serious cash. Again, no true plan. More so a collection of plans based on what the next few weeks brings"
2021-07-02 15:20:06,wallstreetbets,Also I‚Äôm not worried I‚Äôm talking about an undervalued company. At the end of the day I‚Äôm a retail trader and I want other retail traders to make money. I even convinced a coworker to buy AMC. My whole portfolio was tied up that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt buy in. This guy is in his 60s and should have retired so I wanted him to make money. He sold his shares for $68 a share and he bought 100 shares before it took off. To be honest I was happier that he made money then I would have been if I made it myself. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm spreading the word and sticking up for CLF because it has potential to somewhat safer make people some cash if they play it smart
2021-07-02 16:05:10,wallstreetbets,"Yeah man ig time will tell but I just think your so close but so far away.

Finding an undervalued stock is hard. Hard enough that anyone that can do it well is fucking loaded. When you add having to time it correctly its just raising the bar on yourself.  To a level very few if any have ever been able to actually succeed at. The story of Rick guerin is real."

2021-07-02 11:09:22,wallstreetbets,-90%. And they're July 16 calls. Fuuuck.
2021-07-02 11:10:25,wallstreetbets,It's so frustrating being so close and yet miles away. üò´
2021-07-01 22:48:29,wallstreetbets,So your saying definitely buy puts
2021-07-01 22:50:27,wallstreetbets,If NKLA can survive not have ANY product or service.....SPCE will be at least retain a $5/share valuation
2021-07-01 23:30:23,wallstreetbets,You just made me throw up my dollar menu dinner. Lost too much money and talked myself out of spce when it dropped below 20 and today again! Smh I shall remain poor
2021-07-02 16:35:18,wallstreetbets,Fuck your comment made me üòÇ üòÜ
2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why not buy NTDOY? Nintendo is a super safe investment that is currently super undervalued.  They have tons of cash on hand, have strong IP and brand recognition, pay a dividend (usually), and can only grow.  They have a market cap of only 80 Billion dollars or so, a P/E ratio of 15.5x (low!), And have so much untapped potential in markets they have yet to fully enter.  Theme Parks (Super Nintendo World), movies and shows (look at the response to Castlevania), as well as a robust distribution network and  covered IP make them a Disney in the making.  A great value that if people get in board, could be bigger and a great long.  Just my opinion."

2021-07-01 22:49:26,wallstreetbets,"I'm in AMD instead. if I had enough cash to buy entire companies, NTDOY would be on the list, but it wouldnt top it"
2021-07-02 13:01:15,wallstreetbets,What you think a stock should or could be and where it is does not qualify as undervalued.
2021-07-02 10:52:24,wallstreetbets,They don't own Castlevania.  None of the Nintendo IPs are remotely adult themed.

2021-07-02 08:25:39,wallstreetbets,"y nintendo is like disney try to fuck them and youll soon need lube; company has amazing future but for me its a position for life so i dont mind waiting a couple of years for the market bubble to explode as i feel eventually we will find many great companies undervalued, same with cd project and ttwo these 3 cmpanies have a potential to do great quality games compared to ea and ubisoft so will eventually conquer the world but im waiting for the pop"

2021-07-02 14:43:05,wallstreetbets,I held it for 3 years. Not worth it.
2021-07-02 13:43:05,wallstreetbets,"This is a terrible take to have on any company. Just because it's at an all-time high doesn't mean it's done going up. I can't speak for Nintendo's valuation specifically, just speaking in general terms.

Literally every company is either perfectly valued or overvalued with this thought or they'd never continue to climb."

They don‚Äôt make many apps, not to mention unless u r 7 years old playing on ur moms phone there‚Äôs like 5 companies that you think of when someone says video games. Maybe like Sony or Microsoft, who made the most successful consoles of all time and Microsoft also has its own store that you buy games on where it actually makes significant money."
2021-07-02 10:21:04,wallstreetbets,Ooh of course! Wow I'm dumb
2021-07-02 13:21:16,wallstreetbets,"To be clear I'm excluding Microsoft and Sony in my first comment, I'm referring to companies like Take Two , EA etc, compared to these Nintendo is well valued. I don't think it's reasonable to compare to Microsoft, there's a case to be made for Sony though 

Now calm down u angry man"

2021-07-01 21:14:37,wallstreetbets,Keep averaging down until you've no money left. It usually works
2021-07-01 20:57:04,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs ok just hold. This will do well on its own. This will also do well as a possible takeover target after the big banks realize they were caught with their pants down and fintec is eating their lunch.

also unrealized losses are not losses. Go sell 52x 1/21/22 25C and buy 26x 17.5C for a ratio spread, pocketing half your ""losses"" in credit and wait for expiration, or find some other appropriate strikes to hedge your meme fomo with options."

2021-07-01 20:42:36,wallstreetbets,AMD gonna go boom boom next week!
2021-07-01 21:38:00,wallstreetbets,Don't force me to buy it tomorrow because when ever I bought AMD then it goes side way or tank. NO JOKING LOL.
2021-07-01 21:02:31,wallstreetbets,Anyone know when China is supposed to decide their position?
2021-07-02 01:20:13,wallstreetbets,"after acquisition, many new contracts are on the work.

AMD will the leader in everything: FPGA, X86, APU, etc

It can run like Nvidia best to accumulate a small position than nothing."
2021-07-01 21:41:29,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúI see no impediment to the deal from China, other than any purely arbitrary stipulations,‚Äù said Krewell. ‚ÄúI do not know what China can or will demand. Possibly more access to inventory in China in case the U.S. government imposes more sanctions against Chinese companies.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo paraphrase Clausewitz, in China, merger regulations are a continuation of politics by other means,‚Äù said Entner. ‚ÄúIf the Chinese leadership wants to be nice, this can be approved tomorrow. If the Chinese leadership wants to stick it to the U.S., then this dies slow death in a folder somewhere in Beijing. If they want to remind AMD who helped them in need, then China waits a bit and approves with conditions.‚Äù"

2021-07-01 21:30:07,wallstreetbets,"And for the record I‚Äôm not pro-Chinese, but I am pro capitalism. A company like AMD is in high demand especially when you add Xilinx to the Arsenal. As long as they are providing the US with superior technology, they will be allowed to do business in China."
2021-07-01 21:22:37,wallstreetbets,"im all for amd going up, but man if this falls apart because of china, it'll be hilarious tears."
2021-07-02 12:19:42,wallstreetbets,China will approve the deal when the stock price has subdued for a lil bit. Remember those CCP wants to get good calls on AMD before they announce. China inside trades harder then polosi. I see them confirming the deal Q3 end Q4 beginning.
2021-07-02 01:35:24,wallstreetbets,"Shares will be issued to the complete the acquisition. 35 billion worth was the announcement. I don't know if it would make sense for the stock price to go up in that case. Its a hard reduction in the value of each AMD share. As I currently understand it anyway. 

At minimum its not free even though for AMD it technically is. The shareholders pay, AMD gets a company for free."
2021-07-02 12:49:19,wallstreetbets,Is this why AMD has been down last couple of days? Due to upcoming shares dilution?
2021-07-01 21:56:20,wallstreetbets,Can they boom boom by close tomorrow so my call turns green? üòÅ
2021-07-01 20:58:34,wallstreetbets,Is this the tldr version? Lmao ü§£ can‚Äôt read it without paying $4.
2021-07-01 23:24:25,wallstreetbets,Do me a favor and don‚Äôt buy tomorrow. ü§£
2021-07-01 21:27:38,wallstreetbets,I really think Lisa Su announces the merger prior to next earnings (end of July)
2021-07-01 21:07:31,wallstreetbets,They are going to take a while longer. Could be closer to the end of the year.
2021-07-02 11:33:34,wallstreetbets,"Ehhh I doubt they‚Äôll be taking the GPU market anytime soon. They will definitely take a good market share from Nvidia, but it will be nothing like the comeback they‚Äôve had against Shitel"
2021-07-01 23:58:59,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-07-01 21:26:19,wallstreetbets,China is going to approve without a doubt. Sooner than you think too.
2021-07-02 07:54:54,wallstreetbets,Why do you think it‚Äôs been trading in the 75-95 range for the last year???
2021-07-02 10:46:48,wallstreetbets,">Its a hard reduction in the value of each AMD share.

More shares issued is mitigated by two things: AMD's announced share buyback program and the fact that shares of AMD investors post-merger should now increase in value due to the company now having a bigger market cap and having their financials buoyed by Xilinx cashflow.  Not to mention the potential synergies AMD can work with Xilinx' IP portfolio."
2021-07-02 12:53:49,wallstreetbets,It's up like 20% since May. Been on a bullish run because its so close to closing. Been down for 12 months due to merger arbitration. There is no dilution when you factor in Xilinx earnings and cash flow.
2021-07-01 22:01:24,wallstreetbets,It was nice loading the boat on 80c for Jan 2022 when it was $75. Thanks bears and citadel.
2021-07-02 08:01:21,wallstreetbets,"Shit, mine too. I r fukt lol"

2021-07-02 08:19:14,wallstreetbets,Why prior to earnings
2021-07-01 21:25:40,wallstreetbets,"AMD and China have a very close relationship. It‚Äôs in the worlds best interest for this merger to happen. Probably the best Computing, 5G and Defense play in the market. 

Check it out: https://technode.com/2019/07/10/did-amd-really-give-away-keys-to-the-kingdom/"
2021-07-02 11:31:14,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm betting beginning to mid Q4, reading through there 10k they were pretty confident in the deal closing in 2021. Haven‚Äôt read through much of there recent filings but plan on putting some shit together this weekend"
2021-07-02 12:02:51,wallstreetbets,"Come on, dude."
2021-07-02 00:17:46,wallstreetbets,China is petty enough to deny it because Dr Su is from Taiwan. Nothing is certain.
2021-07-01 21:27:26,wallstreetbets,"this is wsb. i am here for tears, not thinking. gtfo."
2021-07-02 08:08:28,wallstreetbets,"its already up a gazillion percent and people new to it use current price as a reference point and think it should go higher. I'm guessing it ran out of steam since so many people are holding and not buying. 

Most of these stocks are ridiculously priced and people still think they should go higher. I don't think there's any reason to care about fundamentals anymore. Its a popularity contest and the ""due diligence"" people do is a way to justify irrational expectations."
2021-07-02 08:10:33,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs 1/3 the P/E of NVDA which would make it roughly $250 stock. It‚Äôs severely undervalued. It‚Äôs lagged all semis due to merger arbitrage. 86 million shares short. You just sound like a lazy bear.
2021-07-02 10:42:20,wallstreetbets,Here's a thought - Nvda is ridiculously overvalued. The argument is that amd should be as overvalued as nvda?
2021-07-02 11:37:39,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre arguments here are so lazy that its not even appealing to try and debate with you, ‚Äúblah blah blah overvalued blah blah‚Äù geez man, you must be a boomer"

2021-07-01 21:55:33,wallstreetbets,So im thinking the reason why DNUT is doing its thing is  its recently been sold in chain pharmacies and super markets as pre-packaged boxes of donuts. I live in NYC and just recently I've noticed them being sold in Walgeens and CVS and Keyfood. I think they might be on the rise for a little while.

This isn't improving the future prospects of the company in any way, and will actually make the first paid flights a bit of an anticlimax.

I made some bank selling call spreads last Friday and again Monday but focused on closing out all my amc and gme today and forgot I had some short space calls still open so I‚Äôll take a hit in the morning but going to let it ride.

I‚Äôll be selling July 10 call spreads 10% otm on the open and then double down if it climbs 5% and then double down again if it hits 70. Already shorted 400 shares after hours, but I do think it could rip a little on the open. Average around 52.5. I might buy some 0 Dte calls as a hedge and a couple July 17 50p."

Almost all ARK funds are barely green/flat for the year while SPX and others are outperforming. 

They do ridiculous swing trades and take huge losses but as long as TSLA/ROKU/SQ etc al. doesn't collapse then they're good to go.

I can list tons of stupid meme trades they do that they buy in, avg up, and sell for big loss. All within months. So much for five year horizon right? But hey it's not her money and it's only 60 mil here, 30 mil there in losses so in these billion dollar ETFs who cares right?

SPCE, WKHS, FSLY, list goes on.

Learn to be critical about how a fund invest their money vs blindly believing they can do no wrong. There's no question that ARK did well in 2020 - but every growth names under the sun exploded as well."

2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GME mentioned in the Robinhood S-1 IPO Filing *Legal and regulatory matters*

*Early 2021 Trading Restrictions*

Beginning on January 28, 2021, due to unprecedented market volatility and related portfolio margin demands imposed on RHS by the clearinghouse National Securities Clearing Corporation, RHS temporarily restricted or limited its customers‚Äô purchase of certain securities, including GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., on our platform (‚ÄúEarly 2021 Trading Restrictions‚Äù).

We have become aware of approximately 49 putative class actions and three individual actions that have been filed against RHM, RHF, and/or RHS in various federal and state courts relating to the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions. The complaints generally allege breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and other common law claims. Several complaints further allege federal securities claims, federal and state antitrust claims and/or certain state consumer protection claims based on similar factual allegations. Approximately 18 of the putative class actions also name other broker-dealers and/or market makers as defendants. On February 5, 2021, certain plaintiffs filed a motion before the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (""JPML"") to transfer and coordinate or consolidate the actions filed in connection with the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions into a multidistrict litigation in the Northern District of California (the ""Transfer Motion""). On March 1, 2021, we filed a response to the Transfer Motion, in which we supported transfer and coordination or consolidation of the actions into a multidistrict litigation in either the Northern District of California, or in the alternative, the Middle District of Florida. On April 1, the JPML entered an order centralizing the cases identified in the Transfer Motion into a multidistrict litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the ‚ÄúTransfer Order‚Äù) captioned In re: January 2021 Short Squeeze Trading Litigation, Case No. 21-2989-MDL-ALTONAGA/Torres (the ‚ÄúMDL‚Äù). On April 19, 2021, the court held an initial case management conference.

RHM, RHF, RHS and our Co-Founder and CEO, Vladimir Tenev, amont others, have received requests for information, and in some cases subpoenas and requests for testimony, related to investigations and examinations of the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions from the United States Attorney‚Äôs Office for the Northern District of California (""USAO""), the SEC staff, FINRA, the New York Attorney General‚Äôs Office, other state attorneys general offices, and a number of state securities regulators. Also, a related search warrant was executed by the USAO to obtain Mr. Tenev's cell phone. There have also been several inquiries based on specific customer complaints and with respect to employee trading. In addition, we have received information and testimony requests from certain committees and members of the U.S. Congress and Mr. Tenev has provided testimony with respect to the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions. We are cooperating with these investigations and examinations.

Due to the preliminary nature of all of these proceedings, we are unable at this time to estimate the likelihood or magnitude of any possible losses related to these matters."

2021-07-01 21:28:01,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the point to take away from this is not ""omg robinhood evil""

It is that there WAS and IS some fucked up systemic issues going on, and definitely some fucked up shit was going on specifically with GME, and how it got to the point that a ton of major brokerages basically lost functionality because of it.

I mean, the whole thesis you guys have is that there wasn't enough shares to go around? So WHY is it so surprising that suddenly everyone had to stop selling them?

Just, the focus on Robinhood is bullshit.

There 100% was and probably is illegal shit going on vis a vis GME, and this was probably a symptom of it. But it wasn't because Robinhood was trying to help out hedge funds or whatever.

Robinhood is INCOMPETENT, AMATEURISH, and UNPROFESSIONAL and is basically a videogame masquerading as a financial institution. That alone is reason enough to spit on them. You don't have to make up conspiracy theory bullshit that flies in the face of facts. There are concrete real reasons to hate them guys."
2021-07-01 21:22:21,wallstreetbets,You think it takes an idiot to believe that the richest people in the world colluded to stay rich? Are you really that naive?
2021-07-01 22:15:18,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúI mean, the whole thesis you guys have is that there wasn't enough shares to go around? So WHY is it so surprising that suddenly everyone had to stop selling them?‚Äù

The thesis is that the float, or more than the float is owned by retail - yes. But your point doesn‚Äôt really make sense to me here. The markets work because stocks change hands at agreed upon prices. The supply of these stocks may be limited, but it isn‚Äôt that they ‚Äúrun out‚Äù like a store might run out of cookies. If the lowest someone is willing to sell a share of GME at was $5000 then the next purchase should go through at $5000, a broker shouldn‚Äôt ever get to shut off buying because they deem this price unreasonable. That isn‚Äôt for them to decide, it is for the market to decide. This is the essence of the free market and it is exactly this integrity that Robinhood along with some other brokerages ruined when they stopped allowing one side of the transaction.

As for Robinhood helping out hedge funds, I can‚Äôt prove it, but the ongoing investigations by the feds tells me that perhaps the theory deserves a little more credibility than dismissing it as a Reddit tinfoil hat thing. The theory is pretty simple, RH‚Äôs whole business model survives on the payment for order flow they get from Citadel. Citadel ‚Äúinvests‚Äù like 2B into a completely failing Melvin capital, right in the middle of the GME Fiasco. From here, the assumption is that this wasn‚Äôt an investment where any kind of return was expected, but instead a way to allow Melvin to post margin so as to not start the squeeze, which would hurt Citadel who has a short position (speculation).

It seems like we basically have the same conclusion that Robinhood is shitty so I‚Äôm not really trying to argue but instead just provide some context.

Additional reasons why people particular hate Vlad/RH:

- says it wasn‚Äôt a liquidity issue. I don‚Äôt even know how he could say that with a straight face when the fact of not being able to post margin to the DTCC sounds like the definition of a liquidity issue

- blames the DTCC for the reason they had to restrict. DTCC later says that the decision was completely internal to RH and that they actually ended up waving the collateral requirement so basically there was no reason they had to restrict 

Again, RH is shitty - we both seem to agree. I just can completely understand why, whether correct, or incorrect, people see a connection between RH and hedge funds, and I personally think it doesn‚Äôt take much looking to at least think something fishy might‚Äôve happened"
2021-07-01 21:30:55,wallstreetbets,You really think the people that run Robinhood are that smart? Robinhood? Really? I'm surprised everytime my phone doesn't explode when I open that failed excuse of an app.

> Sir Richard Branson said: &quot;I truly believe that space belongs to all of us. After 17 years of research, engineering and innovation, the new commercial space industry is poised to open the Universe to humankind and change the world for good.&quot;It&#039;s one thing to have a dream of making space more accessible to all; it&#039;s another for an incredible team to collectively turn that dream into reality.

2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I'm bearish on $CLNE Fellow retards,

I don't have a position in $CLNE, so don't honestly care one way or another if anyone reads this, but I work in the natural gas industry for a larger utility company, and have first hand experience with RNG so thought I would share my insight.

RNG is like the crackhead Craigslist of natural gas. In the state that I work in we purchase RNG from 6 suppliers for our gas distribution system, 2 landfill reclamation locations, and 4 large dairy farms, so the cow shit variety. Ever since it was introduced into our pipelines we've had nothing but problems with it.

Biogas comes out dirty as hell, and needs a lot of work to refine and remove contaminants, before it's even usable RNG. It has to have excess moisture and particulate removed, processed to remove carbon dioxide, dinitrogen, organic compounds, siloxanes and a bunch of other gross shit we don't want in our gas.

Farmer John don't know shit about the chemistry of gas, and neither does your trash man. They just know that garbage and cow farts smell like money, and wouldn't know what a gas chromatograph was if they caught it plowing their wife. They open the valve and get the meter spinning on their shitty gas flowing out into the system.

Immediately we started getting water in our gas pipelines due to their poor attempts at meeting the required moisture levels in the RNG. Next was the high levels of sulphur, which fun fact, when combined with the water turned into sulphuric acid, that started eating our steel pipelines from the inside out. We ended up having to replace a few miles of pipeline closest to the worst farm because it caused so much damage before we realized it was happening.

Next came the siloxanes, which turned into this hard white shit when high volumes of the gas were burned. We found this out the hard way, when our largest customer ($CLF) started having plugged orifices on some of their furnaces. I'm not one to kink shame, you can plug whatever orifices you want, but CLF was super not into it, and threatened law suits until we signed an agreement to never send RNG into their systems again.

TLDR: If natural gas was an eightball of cocaine you bought from a dude who only spoke spanish in Miami, RNG is an eightball you bought in a trailer park in North Dakota. It still sort of gets you fucked up, but it cost twice as much and has so much baby laxative in it that you shit your pants the first time you tried to fart.

Bearish on cow farts

Edit: well damn my messages blew up with some big mad bagholders. Like I said I have no skin in this game, I was just trying to share the other side of the pump based on RL knowledge about the product. My company is still using the RNG in some of our systems, but it's only because of the carbon offsets it gives us with the government (the offsets let us burn more coal in our power plants). I assume the carbon offsets will be a selling point for large companies like AMZN, etc. 

But if it wasn't for the government giving carbon credits, nobody would want this product. I don't see this ever being something smaller companies or private consumers would ever want."
2021-07-01 20:10:40,wallstreetbets,So you're saying that I should buy cocaine in Miami?
2021-07-01 23:38:16,wallstreetbets,"This is interesting and good to know that farmers are bad at chemical engineering and refining techniques. 

CLNE, as far as I'm aware, acts as a refiner. Similar to Shell, Exxon, or BP. They have the gas chroma-whats-its and knowledge to actually refine cow shit and hot garbage like your wife into usable RNG that is functionally similar to normal LNG. 

Their partnership with Amazon will serve them well as Amazon expands it's LNG fleet for delivery and freight services. Although it is safe to say CLNE likely only won the contract because they gave Amazon the best terms compared to more established oil and gas players."

2021-07-02 00:49:23,wallstreetbets,"This is not how RNG works.  ‚ÄúBiogas‚Äù is not sold into the public utility pipeline system as it only ~40-70% methane.  This waste biogas is collected and then goes through a large amount of machinery that gets rid of the unwanted stuff and leaves you with pipeline grade ~95% methane natural gas.  This natural gas is sold into the pipeline system under the same requirements / contracts as natural gas coming from a conventional drilled well.  

Sounds like you are talking about a setup where a plant buys cheap waste biogas direct from a landfill and tries to use it to power something.  This is not RNG and nothing to do with CLNE‚Äôs business model.  Hope this helps‚Ä¶"

Ok first off thank you for this, how very rude of CLF not to be super into it.

Second thanks for the discussion and your comments. Even though I am 95% in CLNE, this is a well thought out critique for the bear case. 

I want to say though my one thought that runs a bit counter to this: isn‚Äôt part of the recent movement related to amazon‚Äôs stake as well as their deal for refueling their trucks. 

I can see there‚Äôs potential drawbacks to using RNG in a pipeline that it can potentially corrode causing miles of pipeline to need replaced. 

But wouldn‚Äôt that perhaps have been priced in prior to the amazon deal. I think the uptick is because of the use in vehicles. This would be different because I imagine it is significantly easier to repair and replace an engine or fuel line than gas pipes. Assuming Amazon has enough of a fleet of trucks and logistical support to repair and maintain the trucks, I would think this is a safe deal.

Will admit I‚Äôm Bull so probably a bit bias but food for thought."

The only thing I find scary about LNG is it has to be kept so cold to stay in a liquid state. I always worry about a what-if scenario where the cooling systems failed and it reverted to a gas state, because it takes like 500 times the space to hold it in a gas state compared to liquid."

Options for the betting bros have been newly established upon expiration on August 13th. A $51 strike price option may seem attractive, especially for a cost basis at $47.90, but I believe a market price below that option of $51.28 and even below $50 market will be great to get in. That would give a great discount of even more than 1% and if more downselling occurs with short selling reports and generally lax summer trading until the wild days of the fall, this one is looking for all the casino and horse bros to take advantage of."

&#x200B;

[early breakout after months of suppression - past the 44\/45 wall and it rip with positive gamma](https://preview.redd.it/45f80o9jno871.png?width=1583&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ef84bfb424ee8f05ce160fbbaaea865f28b3e99)

**synopsis:**

Coupang is South Korea's version of Amazon, backed by Softbank's Masayoshi Son, with aggressive plans to expand to Japan and other areas of Asia. They screwed big funds out of juicy pre-IPO shares, and so they have begun aggressively shorting the stock by call selling. Big institutions have taken the other side of the trade, and are starting to try to squeeze the stock, so their call option premiums don't go to zero.

This trade isn't retail traders vs hedgefunds, these are hedgefunds trying to outmanuveur each other. All we have to do is buy shares to put on the squeeze. And given how much hedge funds and institution like the stock, buying at this price will not be bagholding.

All you have to do is buy shares and/or calls.

**the DD:**

Big institutional buyers and hedge funds couldn't get in on $CPNG at the price they wanted, because $CPNG's pre-IPO price was only available to a small group of insiders. They have shorted the stock via short shares and call buying/put selling. Other institutional members have taken the other side, to the tune of 3.74 MILLION calls at the 45 and 50 strike.

Here's a bloomberg piece that goes into more detail about what was different in $CPNG.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-16/coupang-s-ipo-pop-served-a-purpose](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-16/coupang-s-ipo-pop-served-a-purpose)

$CPNG is so shorted that yesterday, on 6/30, **only 500 shares were available to short at one point**, out of 1.4 billion share float.

the big institutional call buyers on the other end are going to attempt to squeeze the price, so they don't lose out on their premium.

How do you own 129% of a stock?

Either way, $CPNG is ripe for the picking. I am long calls, short dated and long dated. If you doubt the DD, do your own and come to your own conclusions. The next few weeks are some of the most reliably bullish weeks of the entire year - $CPNG is ready to explode."
2021-07-01 20:00:26,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately $CPNG isn't a good company to invest long term.  They're only in South Korea and there's no way they can grow and expand outside the country profitably.  If they can't even make money in their South Korea stronghold, how do you expect them to make money outside the country?

This stock is just a stock that won't go anywhere.  I'd avoid it like the plague and find a much better company to put my money in.

There's a reason why there are lots of shorts in it..."
2021-07-02 06:29:05,wallstreetbets,i was YOLOing on coupang calls and made 150% since the stock surged without any news a couple of days ago. also managed to sell right at the peak of IV somehow. not in anyway against the stock but going to take a break from trading for a while.

2021-07-02 03:56:46,wallstreetbets,Coupang is losing its market shares everyday to Naver and will eventually disappear once naver starts doing same day deliveries which they are working on.

2021-07-01 21:57:29,wallstreetbets,Puts because Branson is Rushing to beat Bezos; it will not end well.
2021-07-01 20:05:33,wallstreetbets,1st fully crewed flight that's gonna end up in the ocean for future space crews to learn from
2021-07-01 20:05:10,wallstreetbets,"Hilarious to see SPCE at 55 when it's basically just a stupid glider that needs a plane to get it up high enough.

2021-07-01 21:38:42,wallstreetbets,"I'm up 91% so far. The potential of this stock long term is, imo, great. This is completely new and to many growing up probably seems like sci-fi coming to life. What kind of value can you put on a company like this? Is 500$ a share a good price? Or I mean I'm just a crayon eater too but I think it should definitely be worth a lot of smackaroonies soon"

2021-07-02 19:01:13,wallstreetbets,I lost over 5k in 7/2 calls today- there was no road to recovery after first trading hour.
2021-07-02 00:25:35,wallstreetbets,How many are we talking about and what was the strike price?
2021-07-02 00:20:50,wallstreetbets,SPCE is really throwing me for a loop when it comes to options. I am experimenting with new plays and... I just keep making poor choices! All profit so far but I seem to miss like 70% of the plays. IT IS SO DAMN FRUSTRATING!

2021-07-02 02:31:09,wallstreetbets,Glad I doubled down Wednesday. May even double down again tomorrow. Could see this trading rolling to 100+. Could double my money if I can get in early tomorrow am.

2021-07-02 06:07:56,wallstreetbets,I know it. I got scared.  As usual.  I'm such a pus
2021-07-02 08:31:28,wallstreetbets,"Why was anyone buying calls anyways? Wasn't Branson's flight already booked for July 4th, isn't this just later?"
2021-07-01 23:22:30,wallstreetbets,"What about me selling puts?  July 2 60p position was down $85k at close, now up $40k.  I believe that is a $125k swing if my maths is correct."

2021-07-02 09:27:18,wallstreetbets,"I sold puts this week; and was honestly pretty excited at the prospect of getting assigned in a range where I could likely get immediate call premium if the price holds till Tuesday.

Its nice walking away with premium, but, I really did want this one to open up long."

I sold some of my 7/16 and 7/23 calls 10 minutes before close in case it dropped AH/PM so I could buy them back after the dip that has occurred the last 4 days. Luckily, I hedged that bet by buying the cheaper 7/2 calls which will be promptly sold at open tomorrow!"

2021-07-01 21:03:25,wallstreetbets,"The only reason this is happening is because bezo said when he would go up. VG still had a handful of test flights left to go and branson wasn't scheduled to fly until later this year. So yeah, congratulations on getting the flight out early  to garner PR by sacrificing safety."
2021-07-02 08:34:04,wallstreetbets,"was it known they were announcing something soon? I have mega fomo atm, naturally"

You should sell, this really isn't a great business. I'll admit it is cool and so is Richard Branson. I'm really not hating because I have no reason to hate. Its not like I can baghold SpaceX yet and Branson is way cooler than Bezos. I just don't think a niche company for cool rich people low earth orbit spaceflight is worth that much.

I think that's where damage control will kick in to educate folks about the difference between a capsule with breakaway rockets strapped to it and an actual spce plane like that of Virgin Galactic. I'll give ya the fact that there may be a temporary hit, if Bezos fails,since spce is the only commercial space tourism company trading right now... but spce would easily bounce back with a few successful passenger flights to prove their tech is solid. What will definitely take a hit is Amazon stock if Bezos fails. That's why I think he's being extremely wreckless by taking off on a rocket that's never been tested with any astronauts or passengers in it."

2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"VALE is exploding on the next earnings report Very short, very simple comparison, I have posted more detailed DD, so if you are interested check that one you.

Iron Ore price peaked at 188/t on 2010 October 01.
VALE stock peaked at $34.83 at 2010 December 31, aka one quarter delay. 

It is no secret, miners track the chart of what they mine.

Miners made the mistake back then when inflation was: 

2011: 3.16%
2010: 1.64%
2009: -0.36% 
2008: 3.84%
2007: 2.85%

To overspend on CapEx, just read the annual reports, or simply check their cashflow statements, most of their FCF went to CapEx. But, the boom was halted, oversupply destroyed prices. 

VALE had EPS $4.34 in 2011 on about 5247 shares. 

Today, VALE has 5120 shares, a share buyback program targeting to buy 5.3% or 270 of all their shares, so 4850 outstanding shares are expected.

According to Bloomberg data (I am flexing, I have access to a terminal), 2021 EPS expected to be 4.94, my personal math (calculations with their projections of production on different segments and lower than current commodity prices) it is about 4.99 EPS (adjusted for 4850 shares).

PE for for 2011 averaged around 8.2.

We can calculate: (4.94+4.99)/2 = 4.965
4.965*8.2=  40.7 price target

I have other estimates, 40-55 would be the range. Since we are talking about a cyclical, these are the peaks. Of course these are way more conservative calculations, not factoring in higher global demand, and 30% higher prices than in 2011. It could go to 60-65 on my more optimistic calculations.

Conservative: $40-$55
Bullish: $60-$65

I sold off all my left over oil which I believe can go 30-60% higher still, to buy up the dip today, as miners all dropped.

Fundamentals are unchanged, story is strong. 100% in VALE."

2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD: Merger Arbitrage $DOYU I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.

**Backstory:**

Huya is looking to acquire Doyu through share acquisition. This was announced during the end of 2020 and the talks and hopes of it happening pending with the CCP. Each Doyu share will be acquired for 0.73 Huya Share.

&#x200B;

**Details:**

Huya - Current Trading Price: $17.25

Doyu - Current Trading Price: $6.76

&#x200B;

Theoretical Acquisition Price: $12.59 (0.73 of current HUYA price)

&#x200B;

**Arbitrage:**

This means that DOYU is currently trading at a discount from HUYA.

&#x200B;

If we look closely at the daily chart, HUYA and DOYU have been trading identical until recently 6/24.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3ectm1tb1o871.png?width=1027&format=png&auto=webp&s=afe0bc0b258202e3ea47d957f974c6ee1f6d65fc

&#x200B;

So what exactly happened on 6/23? Did the merger talks go off the table? I don't think so, I personally think someone forgot to buy DOYU. Here's why. Below BABA, IQ, JD all moved along with HUYA on 6/23. This was the day where money flowed into Chinese stocks. However, no money flowed into DOYU, instead money flowed out. This is an oddity.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kyklu3pc1o871.png?width=1554&format=png&auto=webp&s=09feddc0a6bac49a528fe7d9b09f72f0c6a0d137

&#x200B;

Seekbeta, the popular FUD company posted an article and then deleted it.

Titled: douyu-falls-as-investors-await-chinese-approval-for-huya-deal

&#x200B;

So what exactly is the reason for DOYU trading away from the sector instead of with the sector?

Someone is pushing the price down for a reason. If the expectation is that the merger is not going to go through, why would you short a position before news of the merger not happening, just have puts or short the shares.

Also, why would the price of DOYU flip down during a sector rotation? This leads to the conclusion that the price was pushed down and more shares were accumulated as the sector rotated higher. Huya goes up, DOYU goes down, buy more DOYU get more HUYA after the 0.73 swap.

&#x200B;

Let's say I was a DOYU bag holder and I see everything else going up, what would my instinct be? This is a shit stock! Why would this go down when everything else is ripping up? Emotions would tell me to sell and then move to better plays. When that happens, **big boys come in and take my shares for dirt cheap** and it eventually trades on par at 0.73 HUYA again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR: DOYU and HUYA trading together but has a discount gap to fill."

As I looked over some I noticed one has been steady for the last couple of months. Forterra Inc (FRTA) is has been one of those companies focusing on development of Drainage pipe, Water pipes, and products within those segments for the United States, Canada, and Mexico. More can be found in the link below:

[Pipes & Precast Products Manufacturers - Forterrabp](https://www.forterrabp.com/)

This company is a genuine leader in construction based of Irving, Texas. With all the new demand across the country for infrastructure from Texas strange incident a  couple of months back causing massive amounts of pipe breakage since it was not winter ready to California and now on the table of the federal government I expect this company to continue on it's trend for growing.

As they approach they're next EPS based of analyst Q1 report it was expected to be negative however they beat negative EPS with high of .27!!!

I also have seen them acquiring Barbour Concrete & Barbour Building Systems in order to expect accelerated growth as they spread further in other states that are building into the next milestones of their infrastructure. This is going to be slow growth but I do expect to see a higher price for this company given it's amazing revenue growth as well. Overall I believe this is a very undervalued stock and wanted to share my Due Diligence with you all as I lay down some pipes through the year.

Shipping is pretty crazy though. My order was 9 days ago and I'll get it at the end of the month...maybe. The cool thing is tho. You can track your package as it rides on a boat to way more interesting places than I've ever been.

2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Fed in a Box, Part 2: They cannot end Quantitative Easing: The recent fall in long-term rates may have been by design and is probably transitory This article first appeared on SchiffGold on Monday and also appeared on ZeroHedge this morning.

# 3 Key Takeaways

1. If the Fed tapers QE, it may reveal waning appetite for long-term treasuries
2. The Treasury may have used its cash balance reserve to anchor inflation expectations
3. If inflation persists, the Fed may have to increase rather than decrease QE

*Note: By definition,* ***inflation*** *is an expansion of the money supply. In this article inflation will be used interchangeably with rising prices (usually as a result of money supply expansion)*

## Introduction

When the economy was shut down in March 2020, the government responded with massive fiscal and monetary support. The fiscal stimulus totaled $4T+ in relief packages. All of this spending was paid for with debt being issued by the Treasury. The Treasury mostly issued short-term debt. With rates being held at zero by the Fed, and strong demand for short-term debt, it made sense to quickly raise cash using Treasury Bills as interest free loans.

The Fed monetary policy was two fold, slash short-term rates to zero and inject $1.5 trillion into the long-term debt treasury market. The effect was to bring down interest rates across the entire yield curve. After the initial debt binge, QE changed to auto-pilot, buying about $80B a month in long-term debt (plus another $40B in Mortgage debt). Over the last year, the Treasury has continued to issue long-term debt, averaging more than the $80B the Fed has been buying. This has caused long-term rates to rise.

All of this fiscal and monetary stimulus is not without cost. Historically this type of activity almost always leads to higher inflation. The Fed may have recently indicated they want higher inflation, but this is not true. This stance simply provides cover for them to not act in the face of rising prices. To actually fight inflation, the Fed would have to increase short-term rates above the rate of inflation. [Part 1](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/the-fed-in-a-box-part-1/) of this series went into detail about how US short-term debt has doubled from $2.5T to $4.5T. This makes even small changes in short-term rates an immediate risk to the federal government, not to mention the much higher rates needed in a true inflation fight.

In theory the Fed could leave short-term rates at 0% but end QE and even shrink its balance sheet, pushing long-term rates up to combat inflation. In the short/medium term the Treasury can mathematically handle higher long-term rates because it takes time for the higher rates to work its way through long-term debt. See the chart below that shows how the last tightening cycle worked its way through the average interest rate across debt instrument. Specifically look at Notes compared to Bills. The average weighted interest rate on Bills moved very quickly where the rate on Notes barely had time to increase before rates dropped again.

&#x200B;

[ Figure 1: Source - Treasurydirect.gov  ](https://preview.redd.it/y67gsfsntn871.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=03abb3684cd9e77a39a9b9a8d66aed14eeb5de4b)

Although the Treasury could handle rising long-term rates (even if the economy and mortgage market cannot), the Fed has another problem. Rising long-term rates send an important message: rising inflation expectations. While inflation is first and foremost a result of monetary policy, higher inflation expectations quickly exacerbate the problem. This is why the Fed has been messaging they are okay with higher inflation and also why they have been pounding the table that inflation is transitory. They need to keep inflation expectations low! If inflation expectations were to rise, especially at this critical juncture, it would be game over for the Fed, as they would have to raise short-term rates (devastating the Treasury and economy) in order to save the dollar and squash inflation.

With the economy opening up in March of this year, things were getting very precarious as inflation was rapidly rising along with surging long-term rates. Remember that rising long-term rates indicate rising inflation expectations. This could cause transitory inflation to be much less transitory.

In summer 2020, the Treasury issued enough debt to build up a significant cash reserve. In response to rising long-term rates in Q1 2021, it appears the Treasury strategically used its cash reserves to slow down the issuance of long-term debt. With total short-term debt outstanding already so high, the cash balance gave the Treasury ammunition to decrease debt issuance just as a $1.9T stimulus bill was passed and inflation was set to explode higher. This would have been perfect timing to support the Feds narrative that inflation is transitory to keep expectations from snowballing out of control.

If inflation doesn‚Äôt slow in the coming months, the Fed may be forced to step in. With the Treasury poised to issue more debt, it can no longer rely on its one time use of excess cash reserves. This will put more pressure on the Fed to clamp down long-term rates by increasing rather than decreasing QE. Yes, the Fed may decide to print more money (leading to higher prices) to fight rising inflation expectations (higher long-term interest rates).

# Understanding recent fiscal and monetary maneuvers

Last year when the pandemic hit, the US Government started spending Trillions of dollars. Massive spending plans were approved in the name of stimulus and Covid relief. Because the Government does not have much money on hand, and taxes cannot quickly be raised, the Treasury issued trillions in debt. The markets can easily absorb short-term US Treasury Bills, so when the Fed abruptly cut rates to 0%, the Treasury responded by issuing short-term debt to the tune of $2.4T from March to June 2020. See figure 1 below.

&#x200B;

[ Figure 2: Source - Treasurydirect.gov ](https://preview.redd.it/9mj1tldztn871.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=3333ceed4af61368ecdae363a6282ec42ef8af63)

In tandem, the Fed bought up trillions of dollars in US Debt, but the Fed was buying on the long end of the curve while the Treasury was issuing debt on the short end. This caused long-term rates to collapse. The Fed purchased enough long-term debt to absorb more than a years worth of long-term debt issuance. The chart below, shows how the month over month and cumulative change in the Feds balance sheet compared to the Treasury Debt Issuance of long-term notes and bonds.

&#x200B;

[ Figure 3: Source - Treasurydirect.gov ](https://preview.redd.it/txm25ha3un871.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4928c449ceb56b5143bc6dcbd9ae805748c193a)

This action by the Fed had a massive impact on long-term rates. The chart below shows the difference between the two bars above, specifically the difference in Fed Buying and Treasury issuance of long-term debt for each individual month since Jan 2020. These values are not cumulative. The right Y-Axis shows the the month-end interest rate of the 10 year bond. Looking at this chart shows something extremely clear: When the Fed buying exceeds debt issuance, rates are flat or falling; however, when long-term debt issuance surpasses the Feds buying, rates rise.

&#x200B;

[  Figure 4: Source - Treasurydirect.gov ](https://preview.redd.it/2kmvdvo5un871.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=8560cdd7a3c67c78c185c9d847265a4d578c24e0)

The impact of the Fed can first be seen as interest rates fell from 1.5% to .6% during the initial buying spree. After the initial burst, the Fed put QE on auto-pilot, buying ‚Äúonly‚Äù $80B a month in long-term treasuries. However, because the Treasury was issuing more than $80B a month as depicted by the positive bars starting in June 2020, interest rates started rising.

This trend started to accelerate in November of 2020, as long-term debt issuance was outpacing Fed Buying by around $200B. Things really started to escalate in the first quarter of 2021 as Treasury Debt issuance surpassed Fed buying by $286B in March right as interest rates were crossing above 1.7%.

Then, suddenly, long-term debt issuance started falling in April and was almost even with Fed buying in May. This consequently led to a fall in long-term rates, which are now hovering back around 1.5%. How did this happen just as Biden was pushing through a $1.9T stimulus package? Unlike 2020 when short-term debt issuance was used to plug the gap, Figure 1 above shows that Short-Term debt issuance was actually turning negative (blue bars). What gives?

One look at the Treasury Cash Balance sheet in the chart below tells almost the entire story. This was first highlighted by a [SchiffGold article](https://schiffgold.com/commentaries/why-are-us-treasury-bond-sales-are-about-to-spike/) published June 16. The chart below shows a massive surge in Cash reserves by the treasury last year. Since March of this year, the cash balance has plummeted by over $1T.

&#x200B;

[ Figure 5: Source - Treasurydirect.gov ](https://preview.redd.it/stucdov9un871.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=44c7ce2c570ed26e4db39863bf1cfd6a2d5f3bdc)

# Inflation Expectations

Why such a massive and sudden draw down in the cash balance? In truth there could be lots of reasons, but it does seem extremely sudden. One would think the Treasury, led by Yellen, would be very deliberate and thoughtful about how to use up $1T+ in dry powder. For the past 3 months the Fed has been shouting from the rooftops that inflation is transitory. At the June FOMC press conference, Powell stood up and explained how long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. A proxy for inflation expecations is long-term interest rates.

Had interest rates continued to rise similar to the recent trajectory (climbing from .8% in Nov to 1.7% in March), this would have been a difficult narrative to push. The Fed *needs* inflation expectations to remain in check or else inflation will be anything but transitory. Thus, the perfect time for the Treasury to pause issuance of long-term debt would be April-June 2021 just as the economy is re-opening and the Fed is forecasting inflation to be at its worst before coming back down.

While this is speculation, it would be a very strategic move from both Powell and Yellen. Regardless of the intention though, the problem is that the Treasury has now spent its large cash balance. It could return to the short-term debt market, but the outstanding balance is still sitting above $4T (see [part 1](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/the-fed-in-a-box-part-1/)). It needs to be converting that short-term debt to long-term debt while long-term interest rates are still low and the Fed is still buying. But the Fed is simply not buying enough at $80B to convert all that debt!

If inflation persists beyond a few months, then interest rates are going to rise in a hurry as the market demands higher rates. Adding fuel to the fire will be the Treasury debt issuance overwhelming the $80B Fed buying as it did from November to March. Then what? Who is absorbing the long-term debt to keep interest rates from returning to the upward trajectory from Aug 2020 - Mar 2021?

International creditors have had little appetite for US Debt lately. The chart below shows the total outstanding debt held by foreign governments. In the past 15 months, while the Treasury has issued over $4T in new debt, **the net amount bought by foreign governments is close to zero**.

&#x200B;

[ Figure 6: Source - https:\/\/ticdata.treasury.gov\/Publish\/mfh.txt ](https://preview.redd.it/7lm5dzscun871.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ebeca942362107b6f17d075ce583ee230ac7206)

To zoom into the exact amount of change since the massive debt issuance, see the chart below. In total, foreign creditors have absorbed $120 billion of $6T+ or **less than 2% of total issuance**!

&#x200B;

[ Figure 7: Source - https:\/\/ticdata.treasury.gov\/Publish\/mfh.txt ](https://preview.redd.it/9zn0ir0hun871.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e1186004030730c8e67e5ce1e60333577c8b324)

How are rates going to stay low if the Fed keeps the treasury buying cap at $80B? The Treasury will have to issue more than $80B in long-term debt to continue funding all the massive spending. If inflation expectations stay low, maybe the market will have enough firepower to ingest some of the new debt, but not all of it. With the Fed planning to begin tapering at the end of the year, someone will need to fill the void of $80B. This does not even consider the possibility of shrinking the Fed balance sheet, which should be considered impossible at this point.

The chart of the international holders above brings to mind the image of the Wiley Coyote running off a cliff. With 10 year interest rates hovering near 1.5%, one could argue there is strong demand for long-term Treasury debt. Unfortunately, foreign creditors have turned off their debt purchases. It took decades for them to accumulate \~$7T in Treasury debt. The Fed alone has accumulated more than half that (\~$4.5T) over the last decade. The Fed is making the market seem strong, but as shown above, there might be nothing but air if they were to exit the market. With a thumb on the scale, no one is getting an accurate reading of true demand for US long-term debt.

# What about short-term debt markets?

As highlighted several times, the demand for short-term debt seems to remain very strong. This makes sense as T-Bills mature in less than a year so these investments are perceived as nearly risk free. In fact, it could be argued that the recent Treasury Bill issuance hiatus (Figure 1 - blue bars turning negative) could be causing the stress in the Reverse Repurchase market. The chart below shows the current Reverse Repurchase market. Based on past quarter end data, it‚Äôs very possible that Reverse Repurchases could exceed $1.5T by this coming Wednesday June 30th before coming back down.

&#x200B;

[ Figure 9: Source - https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/RRPONTSYD ](https://preview.redd.it/op6xhqplun871.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=770a48e742389cd11f51e10aee5a2bcc8ef31983)

Many articles have been written to explain this phenomenon, without providing exact clarity on what‚Äôs actually going on. The current understanding seems to be that the banks are awash with cash. So much cash, they are hitting the limits in terms of how much cash they can hold on balance overnight. This is cash that should be invested on behalf of money market funds, but with so much cash in the system, if it were to all be invested in short-term debt instruments it could drive rates negative. To avoid negative rates, the Fed is lending banks assets on its balance sheet overnight in exchange for cash. It is critical to avoid negative rates to ensure money market funds **never** experience a loss and result in [breaking the buck](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breaking-the-buck.asp).

Maybe this is a leap too far, but it seems another solution to the Fed reverse repurchase activity could be for the Treasury to issue more short-term debt. So why has the Treasury been drawing down its cash balance and letting short-term debt mature when there seems to be strong demand in the market? The Treasury must recognize the risk in having too much debt in short-term instruments and is trying to lengthen the duration of its debt outstanding. Unfortunately, this abundance of cash in the Repurchase market is in search of low risk *short-term* debt so will not provide demand for long-term debt.

If this is the case, it has created quite the pickle for the Treasury. By issuing too much short-term debt, the Treasury is by default putting pressure on the Fed to **not** raise short-term interest rates. However, by issuing too much long-term debt, the Treasury is by default putting pressure on the Fed to maintain or even increase Quantitative Easing. To reiterate, this is why it is *imperative* the market believes inflation is transitory. The Treasury cannot stop issuing debt, which leaves the Fed unable to raise rates or taper QE without wreaking havoc in the bond market. Additionally, if the Fed has to fight inflation, then it‚Äôs not just the Treasury facing its Wiley Coyote moment, but the entire US economy.

# Wrapping up

With the economy reopening, the treasury deployed its cash balance at the most opportune time, unless of course inflation numbers continue to increase (which based on all the data, anecdotal evidence, and liquidity in the Repurchase market seems like a strong possibility). Unfortunately for the Fed, the Treasury will have to begin re-issuing debt again. Will it lean towards short-term debt hoping the Fed keeps interest rates low, or long-term debt hoping the Fed will expand QE?

The Fed may be constrained either way because it has its own problem though. Powell must be praying that inflation readings come in low AND job numbers *disappoint*. If both don‚Äôt occur, then tough questions will be asked to justify more stimulus. Yellen and Powell may be best buds, but simple coordination will not be enough. They will need magic and luck to keep the course steady heading into 2H 2021 and 2022.

If the Fed is lucky enough to get low inflation readings out of its rigged CPI it may provide cover to begin tapering. Rising long-term rates won‚Äôt have the same compounding effect on inflation expectations in a ‚Äúlow‚Äù inflation environment. Unfortunately though; long-terms rates will not be tenable over the medium term as the government has to finance more and more debt. As the market this year has indicated, when issuance surpasses Fed buying, rates have gone up. So what happens to rates when the Fed leaves the market entirely? Presumably, they go up a lot. How high will the Fed let rates go before re-entering?

Just because something is inevitable (US Debt spiral) does not make it imminent; however, the next six months of data may shine a bright light on all the irresponsibility over the last 12 years if inflation proves not so transitory. Chances are, the only thing transitory will be ‚Äútalking about talking about‚Äù tapering.

They have to continue the game until at some point it shows that is has been over for years.  The goal now is to keep the ball in play.  In 2018 they tried to raise rates just a little and cut back QE slightly and it about killed the whole thing.  They wont be doing that again.  Everyone knows we have inflation, low unemployment, and rising inflation expectations.  When confronted by all those facts, the ONLY thing you can do is change the rules of the game.   Zero rates are here until the end of the game.   No exceptions.   You literally have the Fed talking about climate change and racial equality as reasons to keep things here since the other rules don‚Äôt apply for these conditions.  The Fed is coordinating with the politicians too.   Since inflation hurts the poor, coincidentally they are coming out with new tax refundable monthly credits and stimulus for the poor.

2021-07-02 00:18:47,wallstreetbets,"Its actionable when paired with research. 

I know that comes across as kind of BS. If for example you are looking at a stock that is getting earnings soon and a ton of calls have been sold, more then normal, you can assume that the market is expecting the stock to have a good earnings report. That's a super oversimplification of the process but generally when your DD is paired with these reports you can see if other people are thinking something similar to you, which will help.

&#x200B;

In order to accurately tell you I would need to know what your position and investment thesis on it is. If for example you think the U.S market will tank in the next 20 days then maybe looking at the option statistics for $SPY to check if a trillion puts were sold might be a good indicator if your crazy or not.  

&#x200B;

I hope this helps."
2021-07-02 00:24:06,wallstreetbets,"Sizzle index is the historical average of options activity on the asset. 

Think of the stock like a griddle, when the option chain is hot and popping then the meat is sizzling, if nothing is happening then its cold. They take the past 30 days (average) and check the volume of today against it. If the sizzle index is high like a 5 or something then your griddle is hot."
2021-07-02 00:27:19,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. 

Most ""retail"" investors only know how to do one thing, buy. The next step is to buy options. The third step is realizing that you can make money from buying puts or shorting an asset. 

Because of this normally we see about double calls to puts on a ticker. If its crazy skewed like 80-90% calls then the market is pricing in something. Same goes for puts, if the statistics is 90% puts then something is going on. Then its just research to figure out why the market is reacting the way it is. Sometimes there is not an answer, but other times you find something pretty cool and can invest before the news hits the street. 

&#x200B;

This is called Alpha decay and its why Hedge Funds pay crazy money to make sure their info doesn't leave the building."

This means less insurance claims. Clov is big on using big tech for enhancing healthcare. You seem very salty. Their revenue has been slowly increasing from 2019 to now. Membership is up. Clov isn‚Äôt worth $9 a share. Clover is at least worth $20. When it becomes profitable it‚Äôll be worth $100.

There is more than enough room for clover to expand. Plus clover partners with Walgreens and I think they have a partnership with Walmart too. So much more upside and very little downside (especially if you got in below $8). 

Clov only has CMS contracts in 10 states. It doesn‚Äôt yet operate in California. Or the rest of the 40 states. It‚Äôs an easy given. Next 3-4 years Clov will be a $100 plus stock."

I like to go thrifting and woke up early this morning to check out some stores about 40 minutes out. For some reason there's this one goodwill that pops up that says it opens at 8 am, which is the earliest by far.

 I got there early, and to my surprise, it's called a Goodwill Outlet. Apparently you need gloves to shop here. And the reviews were pretty bad online -- basically saying it's disgusting.

So, I went to Walmart, and when I came back there was a line of people. Among the line,  only a handful spoke English. I knew I was in for some serious shit.

The doors finally open and everyone rushes in. Laying on the ground are plastic tubs that each person fights over, but there seemed to be enough. 

These people literally run to these conveyor belt things full of clothes just strewn around with no organization or pricing.

I head to the miscellaneous stuff, and at first, it's all junk. But then I see a couple designer handbags. Then, I find this doll from 1967 still in the box. And I hadn't even looked at the clothes yet.

I scored some major shit and went to checkout. I was nervous about how much this shit would cost me.  Lady tells me to put everything but the books on the scale. You pay by weight. So I ended up getting some insane shit for 28 dollars total. Books were 45 cents, so basically you just buy any you see.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.‚Äù

The idea of short squeezes is certainly over done here on this sub, but it's worth mentioning as it is a prevalent factor and could cause a huge pop.

2021-07-02 04:46:20,wallstreetbets,"Jack Ma and Joe Tsai have been taking out loans from US and European banks, and using their $BABA shares as collateral. That's why the stock is down about 1.5% premarket. This is basically what that ProPublica article was about. It's not quite the same as CEOs selling their stock, but if the stock dips in value, there might be forced selling. It's similar to what happened with Bill Hwang and Archegos. 

It doesn't seem like much of a loan though, compared to their overall wealth. It's basically the lowest amount possible to fund their yachts, jets, vinyard, and charities. It's not exactly news either. They've been doing it for a long time, just like most billionaire tech CEOs. 

The only real risk is if it looks bad politically in China, especially as they celebrate communism. The ProPublica article wasn't really news either, but it looked bad in the US anyways. Then again, the news didn't seem to hurt any stocks or make regulation more likely. My guess with all of this is that if the US or China come down on tech billionaires, they'll go after the individuals and not the companies.

2021-07-01 21:09:46,wallstreetbets,"I think maybe 70-75 would be optimistic, but even if that does happen, I don't think it holds it. There has to be some sort of pull back after tomorrow's high. It's not going to just go straight up every day until the flight. I would say 60 is very conservative, but who knows with all the FUD from these ""financial institutions"". If you ask them, the FAA announcement, the Branson announcement, and the next 2 years of flights are already priced in. 

65 is still pretty realistic in my mind. If it opens around 60, I'm throwing everything else I've got into this. 70 is probably pushing it, and 75 would be a dream. My best guess is 68 is the peak tomorrow, it pulls back to 55-62 over the next few days, then the slow march to 65-90 before the actual flight. Post flight, who knows?"

People are scared of losing money, so it's got to be easier to shake out paperhands that are already down or even than it is to convince people to sell when they're already up multiple hundreds of a percent with little to lose and everything to gain."

# Positions or BAN

I picked up Jan22 40 c's in late March and have been buying more periodically since then. Currently up to 25x Jan22 40 c‚Äôs as I read more into their overall holdings and their recent large acquisitions.

https://preview.redd.it/x7t7k8xwkn871.jpg?width=1192&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90e8051c73e9da94b6a9fd4e55f1430c8bd770c8

# Intro to VICI

VICI Properties is a REIT that owns and leases a flurry of gambling centric properties. They were originally spun off from Caesar‚Äôs in an effort to reduce taxes and got their start buying Caesar‚Äôs ‚ÄúHarrah‚Äôs Las Vegas‚Äù property for 1.1B and leasing it back to them for 87.5M per year in 2017.

The next few years they went on a buying spree loading up on casinos and racetracks-- often below replacement cost- while leasing them back to operators at a substantial yearly rake. In 4 short years they went from their first 1.1B property to now holding over $17B in assets with a take of 374M in gross revs.

# Thesis

VICI‚Äôs short life so far has yielded extremely aggressive acquisitions and expansions. Their double digit YoY increases on net revenues has had a strong upward pressure on their dividend yield of which they are bound to give 90% away because of their REIT status. This increase has historically been met with a matching upward pressure in their underlying share price. 

**VICI has recently acquired The Venetian and increased their revenues over the pandemic.**

My hypothesis is that their normal business operations will significantly increase their dividend by $0.06 to $0.09 per share per quarter combined with a Venetian upshot. These combined will push prices up to the mid 40‚Äôs by Jan of 2022.

# Research

## Financials

VICI swings 17B in assets with 7.4B in liabilities. This debt load is best-in-class for a gaming centric REIT. For comparison we can look at MGM (ticker: MGP) which has 10B in assets for 4B in liabilities or Gaming & Leisure Properties (ticker: GLPI) which has 9B in assets and 6.3B in debt.

As a REIT VICI utilizes the AFFO (Adjusted Funds From Operations) metric as their primary measure of cash ingress. There‚Äôs a strong correlation between their AFFO/share and their distribution of dividends since they are bound to give most of their cash away.

As of Q1 2021 they announced that AFFO per share increased 23.7% to $0.47 for the quarter- more on AFFO and what it means for us later.

## Analyst Coverage

Coverage is generally positive with a single hold out in a bearish mood.

## Current Holdings and The Venetian

### Vegas Strip

The meat of this hypothesis centers around the upshot from the most recent acquisition of The Venetian in the Las Vegas strip- one of the largest gaming and hospitality properties in the world. They already held a significant portion of the strip before the acquisition and now it‚Äôs almost a third of the main thoroughfare. A [map provided by VICI](https://sec.report/Document/0001705696-21-000050/vici-venetiantransaction012.jpg) yields the full scope of their holdings as well as their rights-of-first-refusal to acquire more should Caesar‚Äôs divest of more assets:

&#x200B;

### Press release with the details:

* On **March 3, 2021**, the Company announced it entered into definitive agreements to acquire from Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE: LVS) (‚ÄúLVS‚Äù) all of the land and real estate assets associated with the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center, located in Las Vegas, Nevada (collectively, the ‚ÄúVenetian Resort‚Äù), for $4.0 billion in cash, representing a 6.25% cap rate. An affiliate of certain funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc. (the ‚ÄúApollo Funds‚Äù), has agreed to acquire the operating assets of the Venetian Resort for $2.25 billion, subject to customary closing conditions. Simultaneous with the closing of the transaction, the Company will enter into a triple-net lease agreement for the Venetian Resort with an affiliate of the Apollo Funds. The lease will have an initial total annual rent of $250.0 million and an initial term of 30 years, with two ten-year tenant renewal options. LVS has agreed with the tenant to provide lease payment support designed to guarantee the tenant‚Äôs rent obligations under the lease through 2023, with early termination of such lease payment support if the tenant achieves a certain 3financial milestone or a tenant change of control occurs. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to be completed by year-end 2021.

In summary they bought the Venetian for 4B in cash, sold the operating rights for 2.25B and then charged the operator on a triple-net lease 250M per year. Genius. Including the proceeds from the operating rights that they sold back to the operator this property is pushing a 14% cap rate!

## Holding Acquisitions vs Dividend Yield vs Share Price

### Dividends

We can see here that we got a dividend bump rapidly upon IPO and then annually every September from then on out. In particular let‚Äôs pay attention to September 2018/19/20 where we went from .287 to .298 to .33.

### Acquisitions

Ripped from all of the quarterly press releases VICI put since 2018-

#### Summary

* **July 2018**, Octavius Tower- 507M
* **December 2018**, Harrah‚Äôs Philadelphia Casino and Racetrack- 82.5M
* **January 2019**, Margaritaville Resort Casino- \~115M
* **May 2019**, Greektown Hotel Casino- 700M - resold operating rights of 114.9M
* **September 2019**, Jack Cincinati- 186.5M

* **July 2020**, Harrah‚Äôs New Orleans, Harrah‚Äôs Laughlin, and Harrah‚Äôs Atlantic City - 3.2B

Of the rent bearing gaming properties we gained \~600M of assets in 2018, 600M in assets for 2019 and then a monster 4B in 2020. The plain correlation here is the more stuff we buy the more the dividend goes up.

### Price Interaction on Div Increases

As we get dividend increases in September and my play is based on LEAPs that expire Friday of Jan I‚Äôm going to be measuring ‚ÄúPrice % Increase by the 3rd Friday of Jan after div increase‚Äù vs VNQ, the Vanguard Real Estate ETF.

VICI: 9/28/2018 - 1/18/2019 = 21.62 -> 21.11 = -2.36%

VNQ: 9/28/2018 - 1/18/2019 =  80.68 -> 79.43 = -1.55%

VICI: 9/30/2019 - 1/17/2020 = 22.65 -> 26.27 = 15.98%

VNQ: 9/30/2019 - 1/17/2020 = 93.25 -> 94.72 = 1.58%

VICI: 9/30/2020 - 1/15/2021= 23.37 -> 25.16 = 7.66%

VNQ: 9/30/2020 - 1/15/2021= 78.96 -> 84.61 = 7.16%

We can see a general out-performance of VNQ during this highlighted play period post dividend increase.

## Estimating the new dividend

The primary properties that determine the new dividend is 

1. the fact that the REIT is required to give out 90% of taxable income
2. Taxable income
3. Future increases in taxable income from new business

* For 2018 Q1:
   * AFFO (Adjusted Funds from Operation aka VICI‚Äôs preferred measure instead of EBITDA) of $0.36 per diluted share
   * Established dividend, started at $0.16 and ramped up to 0.2875 by Q4
* For 2019 Q1:
   * AFFO per share 0.37
   * Increased quarterly cash dividend by 3.48% to 0.2975 in Q4
* For 2020 Q1:
   * AFFO per share 0.38
   * Increased quarterly cash dividend by 10.9% to 0.33 in Q4
* For 2021 so far:
   * AFFO per share increased 23.7% to $0.47 so far for Q1
   * We have a fat acquisition of The Venetian incoming

The Company estimates AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2021 will be between $1,010.0 million and $1,035.0 million, or between $1.82 and $1.87 per diluted share (about 0.45 to 0.47/share/quarter)

We can see a high correlation between AFFO and dividend output where they try to stick as close to AFFO without going over. Now we increased AFFO by 9 cents and we haven‚Äôt even gotten the Venetian yet. The company itself believes that it‚Äôs first quarter results are going to be about the same for the rest of the year. I‚Äôm estimating a $0.06-$0.09 (18-27% increase in div yield) and higher if they manage to close the Venetian early.

## Technicals

The grey boxes drawn highlight bounces off of the 100SMA on the daily candles. I consider this rock solid support and I believe we are unlikely to breach below this short of a market downturn.

Extending the 100SMA yields a LOWER bound price target of 33.91 by September and about 38.65ish by the middle of Jan.

## Risks

Besides the generic risk of securities, the fact that VICI is a REIT bears the extra burden that REIT‚Äôs are considered less attractive than growth stocks during bull runs. As we get into a reopening phase AND with the backing of the Fed AND the tail winds of inflation pushing up asset prices REIT‚Äôs might suffer more than usual.

## Safeguards

VICI‚Äôs business model has no interest in the actual operation of these properties and simply seeks to collect rent from the property itself. The transactions often involve getting a ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù on the property by selling back the operating rights of the subject property to the original sellers. This has the dual effect of lessening their net cost while also making sure that they are renting to someone that just got a fresh infusion of cash. This model proved to be COVID resistant and will likely be resistant to any potential future shutdowns from new variants.

## Play Summary

I believe the dividend yield is going to be closer to the top end of the estimate which gives us just under a 1/3 increase. Given current price, previous reactions to dividend yield increases and the lower bound from technicals pushing us above 38.65 I‚Äôm estimating price in the mid 40‚Äôs by Jan 2022 hence my Jan 2022 $40 strike calls.

It's in the Intro O\_o

Also, CZR has no dividends and pays VICI rent. Supporting CZR is supporting VICI."
2021-07-01 23:23:32,wallstreetbets,"Dividend irrelevant if you care about total return more than income. CZR business is much larger and has tremendous revenue growth. CZR is also a diversified bussiness with different revenue streams. Ceasers just bot William Hill and has multi-year media/sports betting deals with draftkings, espn and the NFL. I was in the car/eri since 2019 and knew about Vici well before. Vici is a solid company. You a real estate guy/gal?"
2021-07-02 01:34:51,wallstreetbets,"I think you missed the point- We shouldn't care about if CZR is a better performing stock or if the shares are better because it has inferior leverage.

The VICI 40 strike jan 22's calls are 20 bucks each right now and if VICI hits $43 then that turns into a 15 banger... and I have a strong conviction that we'll hit $43 based on the evidence I laid out.

A single jan 22 on CZR  2 strikes OTM is almost 1000 bucks... in order to get a 15 banger out of that you need to get CZR up to $360+/share. There's no way in hell CZR is going up to $360 bucks+

\*edit\* a more fair comparison is the 10 delta strikes since the $40 strike is 10 delta... you'd still need CZR up past the 190-195ish range in order to meet the same multiple"
2021-07-02 02:00:59,wallstreetbets,"The corresponding strike would be the CZR 130 strikes since they are 29% out of the money like your Vici calls and the corresponding target would be 140, however CZR would need to get to 213. The Vici calls are 29% out of the money and your price target is 38% out of the money. Personally I think ytd and 52wtd performance (w/o a significant catalyst) is more important when picking a price target for leaps  than delta alone. I hope you do well. The CZR 160 (11+ delta) would produce a x15 at 186.1 However if you could capture 95% of the 160-165 spread that would produce a x15.88 return. The stock would have to run 52.5% though

Remindme! 203 days"
2021-07-02 02:22:16,wallstreetbets,">w/o a significant catalyst

\^ This. The DD is about how VICI has a catalyst to run the 38% to hit my target and my play is that call options are mispriced to the buyer's advantage."

2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD on $DIDI vs. $UBER Below is a basic DD by a triple threat: autistic, retarded europoor. Not a financial advice. Do you own research.

First of all, I read [earlier DD published on this channel yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ob7nro/dd_on_didi/) and was triggered by it so posting my first DD today. Be gentle.

From the DD linked above:

> At $14.20, DIDI sells for 3x 2021 EV/Rev vs 6x 2021 EV/Rev for Uber/Lyft.

But comparing Uber's revenue to DiDi revenue is not apples to apples. It's comparing revenue to a quarter of the revenue, also known as autism.

DiDi revenues is apples to Uber and Lyft's Gross Bookings. As DiDi cites all gross transactions (what clients pay) as revenues, and put Driver payouts under cost of sales.

Uber's Gross Bookings includes all gross transactions. While their Revenue is only the fees from B2C gross transactions. Exception is their B2B transaction which are booked gross as revenue.

Comparing Q1 Gross Bookings:

* DiDi $6.44 billion, includes China and International etc. ([prospectus page 20](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764757/000104746921001194/a2243272zf-1.htm)). Annualizing by 4 quarters = $25.76B.
* Uber $19.5 billion, for both Rides, Food and Freight. ([Q1 results](https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2021/Uber-Announces-Results-for-First-Quarter-2021/default.aspx)). Annualizing by 4 quarters = $78B.

At the time of my writing (July 1st), price and market caps are as follows:

* $DIDI $16.62 per share, $79.73B mkt cap.
* $UBER $50.37 per share, 94.28B mkt cap.
* $LYFT doesn't disclose Gross Bookings. We will later compare their revenue vs. Uber.

Now comparing annualized Gross Bookings (""GB"") multiples:

* $DIDI 79.73B mkt cap / 25.76B GB = 3.1x EV/GB multiple
* $UBER 94.28B mkt cap / 78B GB = 1.2x EV/GB multiple

DiDi 3.1x vs. Uber 1.2x ‚Äî that's 2.6x difference, with Uber either undervalued, DiDi overvalued, or both.**

Main assumption is that as peers and same models, long-term they will hit similar margins and EBITDA levels. Uber has also been growing GB and Revenues at faster pace than DiDi last years. Revenues 2018 to 2019: DiDi 14.4% vs. Uber 24.6%. Comparing 2020 both are slow due to the pandemic.

Cash equivalents end of Q1 $DIDI $3.7B ([filing page 23](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764757/000104746921001194/a2243272zf-1.htm)) vs. Uber $6.6B ([Q1 filing](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001543151/af667a46-c7dc-4f72-8754-886d6338d2ce.html)). Uber also literally owns 12% of DiDi now worth $8B to $9.5B ([Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/losing-china-uber-stake-didi-205908417.html)).

Further, as Uber, Lyft and DoorDash report revenue by the same principles. Comparing Q1 annualized revenue:

* $DASH 58.70B mkt cap / 4.3B rev. = 13.7x EV/rev multiple ([Q1 report](https://s22.q4cdn.com/280253921/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1-2021-Financials_CLEAN.pdf))
* $LYFT 20.20B mkt cap / 2.4B rev. = 8.4x EV/rev multiple ([Q1 report](https://investor.lyft.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/Lyft-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/default.aspx))
* $UBER 94.28B mkt cap / 13B rev. = 7.2x EV/rev multiple

By this metric Uber again comes the most undervalued, while having the best cash position, most equity stakes of other players, and biggest business footprint."

2021-07-02 13:45:23,wallstreetbets,">Financials are decent but it trades with the Chinese discount so there's no point in comparing directly to Uber. It's just not gonna get to the same multiples investors are willing to give Uber.

Isn't he saying that DIDI is getting valued at a higher EV/GB multiple than UBER?  Implication being that UBER is undervalued?"

2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A different kind of post - Classic narrative Lately a new narrative has taken over the interwebz.

Instead of investing in innovation and entrepreneurship, it is researching which stocks have heavy short interest and creating a movement to exploit this in order to create explosive growth.

The technique is clear and obvious.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

Now onto the classic part of this post:

Every day I check a list of equities.  I don't pretend to think this is a great list or even a good list but it's my list hah

I first look at Tesla (I still think it is over valued but I like to see how it tracks).

I then look at Ride, NKLA, QS.  NKLA in my opinion being the trash of trash and a great example of how a bull market can keep anything afloat Lol

Then I go to Pltr, Peloton, Bmbl, Door Dash, Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Snowflake.

Then I go to Nakd, and Fold.

Then I check out some classics like Pfizer, AT&T, Coca-Cola.  I weirdly like to look at Moderna.

Then I check out Endeavour Group Holdings, Coinbase, Thredup, Walkme.

Then I check out Canopy.

Then BB, AMC, GME.

Then SLV, GLD.

Then Trillium, CRISPR.

Then onto the coins.

Then RKT and SPCE.

It is a weird routine I have each and every day almost.

I think it provides a good exposure to a various class of equities sometimes by groups, sometimes by weird segments of the investing sphere.  

I think everything is insanely priced and way to high hah but we are in the everything bubble so that is what it is.

All in all the classic narrative is that it provides me a good understanding of what is happening in the various big blocks of the investing world.  Also through google finance I get some good recommends on companies that I don't know about that maybe I will like based on that list and then I expand it sometimes.

Companies like CRISPR being the things I want to invest in for a better world.  Despite that I am not touching any of this shit with a 10 foot poll based on the pricing and our current market.

What equities would you add to look at and why.

I'd love to know what your lists are and the reasoning you like to track those particular sets of equities and such. :)

Let the shit throwing begin as I know many of you identify as apes but I still like to identify as the evolution known as human."

and please forgive me if this is the stupidest question ever. I am truly ignorant about all of this. I should probably add that i purchased 50 shares of gme. So I have invested only around $11K"

2021-07-02 19:14:37,wallstreetbets,Yup. I saw someone posting a screen shot of her selling of 83 shares of AMC - I beleive it was that many. They wouldn't allow her to sell them ü§£üòÇ FHL

It‚Äôs cause I was so shocked I did a double take"

2021-07-01 20:50:43,wallstreetbets,so many new brokerage apps popping up.. do a background check. maybe some of these apps are set up offshore and they can just exit scam.

2021-07-02 06:24:14,wallstreetbets,Are they free like Robin hood
2021-07-01 20:51:25,wallstreetbets,Trust me all brokers take positions according to your trade history. They either bet against dumb money or similar position with a hedge for smart money retail traders. And Central banking finances it all.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

If GME was at $1300 it would be incredibly overvalued (beyond what it is) and would experience a catastrophic crash. Anyone saying they would buy for that price is just trying to convince idiots to bail out their position. 

It's pretty easy to see for just about anyone that this stock is not worth what you guys claim. You can claim its a gamble that might pan out. You can't claim its a wise investment or that $1300 is a reasonable price you would pay for this turd."

2021-07-02 15:23:39,wallstreetbets,I actually did download Fidelity and set up an account. When I applied for option trading they sent me the pamphlet in the mail saying I was approved but the app says I'm not approved.

2021-07-02 02:42:01,wallstreetbets,"My smooth brain friend, welcome to r/thetagang

DRIP is often used in the dividend world (boomer stocks): Dividend ReInvestment Plan: basically use the dividends you receive from stocks and immediately reinvest the proceeds into purchasing more shares. You can do the same with options to utilize compound interest. 

I just looked at the july 9 12.5C and it goes for .40 or $40 per contract. Looks like Haydini can sell 8 contracts for a total of $320 and immediately uses that to buy shares (about 30 shares, give or take).

Rolling contracts means he buys to close his contracts and resells them for a later week. Pretend by Jul 9, his contracts are about to expire in the money‚Äîhe‚Äôs going to lose his shares. Instead, he buys back his contracts and sells another set of contracts for a higher strike/later date (often called rolling up and out). 

Check out the ‚Äúwheel‚Äù method."

2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Xpeng growing faster than Nio Hey all, I've been long on Xpeng since late last year and keep noticing ZERO hype about it where as all the hype regarding Chinese EV players landing with NIO.

While I'm fond of both companies and think both will prove to be extremely successful and huge EV players in the next 10 years, I think ya'll need to pay attention to Xpeng moreso than NIO.

Excluding fundamentals, Xpeng has shown consistently over the past three quarters faster and more significant growth quarter to quarter, and month over month than NIO. Those numbers are pretty non-negotiable because they're statistics, not opinion. NIO is still larger, but Xpeng is rapidly catching up.

Lots of the claims I see around this sub are in regards to NIO ""being the future of Chinese ev because of luxury subscription services, battery swap options, and future expansion into European markets""...can I ask what ya'll are smoking? Xpeng is ALREADY IN NORWAY. They entered Norway last during Q4 2020. Regarding battery swap...although it leads to faster charging solutions (because of lack of charge), it's not going to be sustainable and as faster actual charging solutions become available, this NIO service will become less of an advantage. For subscription services... Cmon guys. Ya'll know that these services were exactly the reason why NIO was on the brink of bankruptcy last year? It's a EV company! Not a luxury club. I really think people are overestimating that area as a future peer-advantage.

Xpeng doesn't have to worry about any of that. They don't swap batteries, they simply altered their models to utilize LFP (Lithium phosphate batteries) instead of Lithium Ion. Lower range but faster charging and... Let's be honest. Chinese EV clients are going to be living in cities. LFP batteries with 80% the range for cheaper aren't a deal breaker by any means. Subscription services don't exist because they aren't a smart idea for EV companies, and XPENG ALREADY ENTERED THE EUROPEAN MARKET IN Q4 2020. Guys, they're already better than NIO in this area, not even counting growth potential.

Xpeng devotes more money towards R&D than any of its competitors, has better tech already, and is the first EV Company to be launching a mass-produced Lidar equipped EV ever. All of this isn't including they're autonomous system with rivals Tesla and definitely exceeds NIOs tech.

So my question stands... What's with the hype of NIO  when Xpeng is the better bet?"

2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD: La-Z-BOY Do We Need To Talk About This Company (LZB) &#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qdpxph5vtm871.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c00c40c673d345cbf02a9ad010d3c8cc1eefd361

# La-Z-BOY Do We Need To Talk About This Company (LZB)

A solid company financially with a record backlog that is poised to break out once the supply chain issues are sorted out. 

**Company Overview**

La-Z-Boy is one of the world‚Äôs largest residential furniture producers and have been around since 1927. They became well known after designing the reclining chair, which was an instant hit and gave birth to a new generation of lazy TV junkies whose ability to communicate slowly drifted away, as they did while relaxing on a soft comfy chair. Since then, they have expanded to manufacturing, importing, and selling a wide array of residential furniture including sofas, loveseats, chairs, sectionals, modulars, ottomans, and sleeper sofas in over 60 countries.¬†

They operate through three segments: The upholstery segment, the Casegoods segment, and the retail segment. The upholstery segment is their largest segment and is responsible for manufacturing and importing furniture to sell directly to La-Z-Boy furniture gallery stores and other major furniture dealers. The Casegoods segment imports, markets, and distributes casegoods (wood furniture) through three brands: American Drew, Hammary, and Kincaid. The retail segment sells furniture directly to the consumer through 354 company-owned La-Z-Boy galleries and an additional 561 independent Comfort Studio locations.

**Financials**

Overall La-Z-Boy‚Äôs finances are very solid thanks to an amazing recovery year post-COVID.

[Financial changes YoY](https://preview.redd.it/8v0bzfb3um871.jpg?width=587&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cb3f9903b582eb50fad3af676d04bf5a1562fc2)

Everyone would expect them to have a comparatively good year considering they had to halt operations at the beginning of 2020 due to COVID but they still did comparatively well as they are above pre-COVID levels.

Taking a closer look we can see a few causes for concern, primarily in their margins. In their latest 10-K the company says: ‚ÄúIn the short term, the company expects a temporary negative impact to profit margins versus very strong fourth-quarter results due to dramatic raw material price increases which will only be offset by previously announced pricing actions as the company works through its backlog in the back half of the year.‚Äù We can already see the trouble brewing as their largest segment, the Wholesale segment saw their operating margin decrease from 11.1% the prior year to 10.2% in 2021. All other segments operating margins were up but expect them to decline in the short term but we‚Äôll touch on this later.

**Comparing the Competition**

There are not that many publicly traded furniture manufacturers/retailers with a similar market cap in the U.S. but here are two of their biggest competitors and how they stack up:

&#x200B;

[Financial competition comparison](https://preview.redd.it/k805t155um871.jpg?width=504&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb37edc90f26941f48fae053e497287460786ba2)

They rank 1st or 2nd in the metrics above and have an outstanding free cash flow margin of 15.6%, a very important metric in my eyes. This means that 15.6% of their revenue was converted to sweet cash money.

**The Stock, I Like It**

The stock tanked \~15% following their latest earnings report (we‚Äôll get to why in the next section). The reaction is completely overblown and the stock oversold in my opinion here are some other highlights:

[Price ratio comparison](https://preview.redd.it/88xad0l8um871.jpg?width=604&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c613d655eab821a5cf4b99f1e8e6e674058f1ce0)

**Technical Analysis**

I‚Äôm not too big on TA, the only trend I like to monitor is support levels/barriers and it‚Äôs hard to ignore the support level around $36.50 over the past six months.

[6 month chart showing support at $36](https://preview.redd.it/ydn9t4zcum871.jpg?width=1487&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c9484910a8eb94b3c18669b04da2eccb60411da)

 **Valuation** 

[Future cash flow analysis](https://preview.redd.it/de6vygreum871.jpg?width=1845&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ceeae7699ffd40b39cf87b74f67407604731358)

Doing a very simple and conservative (3% annual growth, 10% discount rate,¬† 5.8% FCFM) DCF analysis over the next 6 years, I get a present value of $36.88, which is in line with the current price. However, I believe La-Z-Boy‚Äôs actual growth will outpace even more liberal estimates as they:

* Successfully fill their backlog of orders¬†
* Expand manufacturing capacity¬†
* Continue to increase Joybird‚Äôs profitability
* Continue their share buyback program (3.4 million shares available under current program)¬†
* Take advantage of positive economic and housing trends
* **I have a 1-year price target in line with other analysts at $46.**

**Outlook**

La-Z-Boy smashed earnings so why did the stock tank? Because of foreseen supply chain issues. President and CEO Melinda D. Whittington said ‚ÄúGlobal supply chain disruptions and headwinds related to raw materials and freight costs will cause some volatility in results‚Äù. She admits that profit margins will take a hit as a result and delivery times will increase due to the supply issues.

Fine, but does that warrant a 15% dip in the stock price considering how well they performed? Not in my opinion, for one, margin declines can be somewhat offset with price increases which I think consumers are expecting at this point anyway besides, if you buy a house, you HAVE to furnish it right? I believe the supply chain will sort itself out sooner rather than later.¬†

Almost all of their financials are up YoY dramatically and they have orders coming in non-stop. While the CEO didn‚Äôt mention any specific details she consistently mentions ‚Äúrecord backlog‚Äù throughout the latest earnings report. La-Z-Boy is also doing what they can to increase their production capacity. The CEO states ‚ÄúThe company anticipates ongoing incremental increases in manufacturing capacity throughout fiscal 2022 that will enable higher delivered sales‚Äù. We can see this right in their cash flow statement with $38M spent on capital expenditures for FY‚Äô21.¬†

Some other bullish highlights include:

* The company repurchased 1.1 million shares for $44M
* Paid $17M in dividends
* Joybird, an e-commerce furniture retailer purchased in 2018 has become profitable
* The current housing boom shows no signs of slowing down and people who buy houses need...furniture!
* According to simplywallst which aggregates data from analysts the fair value for the stock is $48.72 meaning a 30% upside from the current price of $37.23
* 92% institutional ownership with Blackrock and Vanguard owning 16% and 10% respectively
* We Americans are LAZY and love sitting on comfortable things that become even more comfortable with a lazy action like pulling a lever

Check out what analysts think about La-Z-Boy and the price targets according to marketbeat:

**TL;DR:** Company good. Stock good. Dumb dumb investors selling because company have short term supply issues mean low hanging banana for furry jungle dwellers.

**My position**

78 shares @ $38.28

2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Calling all underwriters/mortgage people who were working in 2008 Everyone is saying housing bubble. I don't think this is the case. This seems like dispersion of populace to me to greener pastures. Rates were so low that even if people bought at 50% markup, they got a good deal if they hold 10 years+. The real question here is: how many of the mortgages you came across looked sub prime to you? Are we repeating history again or did most people have reasonable incomes working in stable jobs like tech? If we are not giving out subprime mortgages like candy this time around, then the housing bubble is just starting. Many older people saw their 401k's and portfolios go 2x-4x since covid. Many people will be retiring early and leaving the major cities for slower rural life with the occasional remote consulting gig. It feels more like a populace dispersion than a housing bubble, the real bubble was renting in major cities. One interesting thing is credit card balances have been dropping (as an economic indicator), so it might be that people are saving thousands by moving out of cities with high rent (fuck you nyc and sf) and buying. But back to my original question: are you guys seeing lots of subprime mortgages this time around?  Edit for those wondering about why this in WSB:   $XHB play"
2021-07-01 20:11:57,wallstreetbets,"The fleeing from large cities like new york is driving the housing market. Plain and simple. I see literally 100 citidiots a weekend, trolling the roads in my area of upstate new york (hudson valley area). Why? Mass transit close by, major highway intersect and commute to the city. Time to sell on a listing? Avg 5 to 7 days. Realtors cold call homeowners looking to list their homes and can get aggressive to try and get you to list. Randos have personally pulled into my driveway, got out and asked if i was interested in selling. So i toss a stupid price..750k last time i was asked. They try and grill you for information about the area and who might sell. Last couple was a bit aggro. So i had to ask them to leave my property. Mortgages are solid so thats not a bubble. Its  the slowdown of sales and housing price correction that could cause people to realize they overpaid, then it will get interesting. The city itself is going lower middle class, or section 8 levels. New York is turning into a lawless shit hole and taxes/c.o.l is rising rapidly. Schools and educational institutions are filled with the next wave of garbage humans and thats a small part of the factors driving the housing markets escalating prices. The bust? Housing market correction and the inability to just pack up.and go back down to the city. Also as an fyi, lots of small towns and villages have enacted 2 acre minimum housing parcels. So the McMansion era wont happen again and new builds can be tightly controlled. So 10 acres yields 5 homes not 25..btw independent mortgage broker and local village board member."
2021-07-02 13:29:52,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm the financial controller for a North East lender doing about $1 Billion in originations. 

From where I sit and from what I see in the applications coming through and the products that are being used to purchase homes, we‚Äôre definitely not in a bubble. We‚Äôre doing a ton of conventional loans and even though we offer the Non-QM loans (aka shit loans) we haven‚Äôt been seeing their volume surge. Reality is low rates means people can afford more expensive homes. When rates start to rise well either have to see wages increase or home prices fall.

Underwriting standards are incredible now and any major financial issues will be isolated to the shitbag greedy lenders and hedge funds that are pumping out subprime non-QM shit loans to hold in their servicing portfolios."
2021-07-02 00:49:48,wallstreetbets,"I've played with real estate over the years. I think there are a multiple things to consider. 

New starts are down, lumber prices are too high, labor shortage. Everyone who had any money spent the covid year fixing up their house. I can't find anyone to do repairs. 

How many landlords are gonna be foreclosed on because their tenants aren't paying rent? How many homes of all types are gonna be for sale when the landlords can boot people out again? 

Right now everyone is staying put thus the housing ""shortage"".  Tenants are still protected in many areas. Housing prices have gone way up BUT it costs more to buy another house so why bother? 

The last question is how many people are leaving the big cities and moving to the less populated states because of violence or politics? How many now have remote jobs that will stay that way? How will this effect housing prices in the large cities? Prices have almost doubled where I am in Rural NE Oklahoma. Crazy times. Lots of variables."
2021-07-02 01:03:04,wallstreetbets,"The one thing I'll always remember from 2008 was Quicken Loans pumping interest only and no income verification loans. They're not quite back to that, but they will give you a mortgage on 3% down."
2021-07-02 01:24:02,wallstreetbets,My wife is the Director of the Compliance/Operations department at the mortgage company she works for. She works about 12-14 hours a day making sure that every loan that comes through meet very specific guidelines based on the state it comes from. They are making sure they cover their asses every which way they can anymore. Gone are the days of getting a mortgage without proof you can actually pay it back.
2021-07-02 02:17:01,wallstreetbets,"Idk but I can say I just ordered a brand new car today, and they didn‚Äôt ask me for proof of income, it was not required. I just have to bring my down payment and ID"
2021-07-02 03:13:03,wallstreetbets,Everything I‚Äôm writing is A paper right now. 60 loans a month.
2021-07-02 11:02:47,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm a mortgage broker and things don‚Äôt look too risky yet. I‚Äôd say most of the increased buying / pricing is from interest rates. Normally people wouldn‚Äôt afford these prices but when you look at the monthly payment it‚Äôs not bad at all.
2021-07-01 21:08:42,wallstreetbets,"Not a underwriter or mortgage person, but I'd be worried about buying a house right now and for the next few years for several reasons:

1) The Fed HAS to raise rates within a couple of years or so to combat inflation. The last time they did that was December 2018 and the market did not like that at all.

2) There is clearly a housing shortage, but like others have already stated - the eviction moratorium will end at some point which will free up quite a bit of real estate. I don't think it will just end suddenly and leave millions in the street though. Not if the ""40 million people at risk of eviction"" figure is anywhere close to being true. That's fucking insane - over 10% of the population.

3) Construction might catch up. I'm not sure what the outlook is on how much new housing is expected to pop up over the next 5 years, but in my area I've never seen so much new housing under construction. Deapite lumber shortages, current home prices are still a great building incentive.

4) Then there's the potential for a commercial real estate crash, if you buy into that DD from a few weeks back."
2021-07-01 21:07:59,wallstreetbets,"Initially read your second sentence as ""not quite retarded yet at 42."" Been reading this sub too much..."
2021-07-02 01:17:02,wallstreetbets,"Yep. Just bought a house and despite having demonstrated that I could have paid for it in cash, decided to go with 20% down and a mortgage, betting that I can beat the interest rates with investments and inflation. It was a jumbo loan, and the amount of paperwork I had to present, including follow-up questions and requests, was insane. I came very close to saying fuck it and paying cash just because of the pain. Glad I stuck it out because now I have a nice pile of cash to invest, but I'm pretty confident that the banks are not just throwing money around like they did in the 2000s."
2021-07-01 20:59:39,wallstreetbets,"I just wanted to comment on the Bay Area salaries for tech as I do a lot of hiring for tech throughout USA. Initially, most thought salaries would decrease because of remote work (people leaving the Bay Area). However, the opposite is occurring; as remote work is further normalized, there is far more competition for engineers nationwide thus causing salaries to increase‚Ä¶ engineers want to have their cake and eat it where ever they want. Sure some companies try to keep salaries lower based on region, but now that so many companies are open to remote, engineers have a much larger pool of opportunities."

Anyway, I remember my boss telling me about NINA loans which were all the rage. I just remember thinking, wait they just take your word for it and give you the loan?

[Posted the same Q](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/obnprd/what_are_your_best_12_line_counters_to_the_advice/) to r/investing and curious to see how WSB comments differ lolz

Original context:I have a lot of friends who have heard stats about how most professional traders do not outperform the market and therefore it‚Äôs a fool‚Äôs errand that a non-professional trader try to pick individual stocks to invest in, instead of just passively dumping things into an index fund. Obviously, there‚Äôs wisdom and value in this advice, but for those who have started to pick individual companies to invest in, I'm curious to hear your simple one(ish)-liners that hit on the reasonableness and appeal of stock picking.

Imagine addressing someone who is:

* Scared to pick individual stocks AND/OR
* Feels like it's gambling AND/OR
* Has heard, ""most professional stock pickers can't even outperform the stock market long term.""

No paragraphs or multi-clause arguments or rebuttals to the prompt saying ‚Äúit depends‚Äù. Quick and dirty one-liners only please."

However, unless you're stoked about 8-20% returns you have to take risks. Leaps, stock picking, fds are the way. I often take the intense gains from risky moves, split some back into ETFs and blue chip, and then pick the next winners. I'm not afraid to take a loss to move capital around. Scared money don't make money."

2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Want to go to the moon? How about on the only publicly traded space rocket stock Astra Space (ASTR) Astra  is developing a rocket that ships in 5 storage containers and can be ready for launch with just 5 people from virtually anywhere. 

Astra is focusing on small payload launches with cheap disposable rockets that will deliver the customers payload directly into orbit. On ride sharing launches a customers payload is grouped in with other satellites like in a spacex falcon 9 launch and might take days, weeks, or longer for them to reach their desired orbit.

Astra already has 50 contracts valuing over $150,000,000.00. 

By this fall Astra aims to be doing a launch a month, weekly launches by next year, and a launch every day later on. 

A delivery system like Astra has great potential for military and defense contracts where time is of the essence. What other rocket can be launched from basically a parking lot anywhere in the world in just 5 days? 

At just $14 a share the room for a big return is massive on this stock in my opinion. 

I'm already invested in them and plan to continue investing. Thoughts? Questions? Comments?"

In my case I have some money to spare and I believe Astra is going places so I choose to invest. I'm not suggesting bet the farm on it.

TSA releases checkpoint travel numbers every day at 9am [here](https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput).  We're at the cusp of eclipsing 2019 throughput and tomorrow will put us over the edge for two reasons:

1. The trend is steady ‚Äì traveler throughput has been rising \~3.8% week over week (WoW). Weekend and Friday travel has been recovering at a faster \~4.1% WoW rate.
2. 7/2/2019 was a bit of anomaly ‚Äì far lower that expected ‚Äì so tomorrow's throughput can actually *drop* by 2.1% (I'd give that a 5% chance, at most) WoW and *still* beat 2019.

So, if you have faith in the 24-hour news cycle picking up this event and rejoicing, you can expect it to make some green waves when markets open on Tuesday. Load up on discounted travel recovery stocks.

For those who can't read, here's a pretty chart. The first/smaller circle is 7/2's eclipse. By 7/25, assuming the trend doesn't suddenly reverse course, this will become a regular occurrence.

2021-07-01 20:11:44,wallstreetbets,"Not advice, just my opinion. 

What is your money earning in the bank? Interest rates are terrible. 

Put your money into a small group of diversified, blue chip, dividend paying stocks. 

Diversified = different sectors. Look at renewables, utilities, financials, oil and gas, consumer discretionary, real estate. 

Blue chip - companies with solid fundamentals that are earning money and have been around for years. 

Dividends - These are stocks that pay you to own them, and 3% to 6% is more that you will get from a bank account or bond. 

You can't make money if stay on the sidelines, so put your money to work for you sooner rather than later.

The crash may come, if it does all you have to do is continue to put money in regularly, buying the dip, and wait it out - it will rebound. Don't panic. 

My opinion, is that a full crash is unlikely in the near term, probably more like a 10-15% market wide correction, when it comes - 1 week, 1 month, 1 year? Who can say.

In my view, your best sectors to grab right now are REITS, financials, and utilities. 

Hopefully that's more helpful than all the ""fuck off and do your own research posts""."
2021-07-01 22:38:07,wallstreetbets,Time in the market is better than time in the market for most people. Waiting for the perfect time of entry likely means you lose out on a lot of gains.
2021-07-02 01:58:28,wallstreetbets,"A pop would be inevitable, if you missed the really don't buy the top. Instead buy with a paper account for the next 3-4 months and get a feeling on how to trade. 
Usually September is the worst month for the market, meaning best time to buy low.
Make a list of top 20 stocks and pick the top 5, do DD on them learn everything about the stocks you are planning to buy and wait when they crash. 
The number one advantage retail had over hedge funds is we can sit on the sidelines cash waiting for the best moments to atack."
2021-07-01 20:00:22,wallstreetbets,"I'd say day trade with small portion of your cash right now, and wait for the correction? Profit"

2021-07-01 23:27:48,wallstreetbets,"Not sure of your age, but never listen to TV Analysts. Especially TV stock news analysis. Lets face it. Boomers are afraid that they won't have any retirement money. TV stock news personalities are guessing just like you. If they were smart enough. They would be running their own Hedge Funds. But they are not. It's very rare to see an actual Hedge Fund Manager on a TV show. And when you do. They are usually selling something. It's up to you to guess what that something is. If you have to work for a Cable TV company as a stock commentator. How good could you actually be. They are mostly Idiots that know a little stock lingo and have questions pre written so they sound smart. They always predict a crash every year. Then low and behold. One year they will be right. Right now there is a huge transfer of wealth taking place. So find well run, undervalued companies, and invest through any crash. In fact if you have access to borrowing. Leverage up once they start crying the world is over. I have traded through three crashes. I learned from each one of them. First thing to learn is just when to go to cash. Don't worry about your losses. Buy Puts on what you want to hold and sell everything else. Don't buy until they start taking like it will never for years. Remember in 2009. The phrase ""The New Normal"". That's all they talked about. That's what you look for. Then buy all you can afford. Then just go to work everyday and wait. If you learn Options. You switch to buying Calls when the Bull Market starts. Rinse and Repeat on the next cycle. Oh never try to catch the falling knife of a Market Crashing. Just keep your cash. Institutional sellers run in the herd. So they will start selling right after Hedge Funds start dumping. They are the Tell in poker terms."
2021-07-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$WISH DD This DD is using Elliot's Wave Theory.

In Elliot's Wave Theory the following rules must hold true for it to remain valid.

The bottom of wave 2 does not retrace more than 61.8% of the gains from wave 1Wave 3 is the largest and most powerful wave which often extends wave one by a ratio of 1.618:1Wave 4 typically retraces less than 38.2% of wave 3

If these hold true, my prediction is that wave 2 bearish trend will reverse at $11.8. Wave 3 will reach $18.56 which is in line with several analyst predictions that the medium target price is 18.3-18.6.

and a correction wave 4 will drop to 17.28. After which there will be one more bullish wave 5 before a long-term trend reversal (bearish).

Not financial advice, but I imagine the price for Wish will hit a high of 18.56 near the 16th of July (or sooner) and will have one more peak soon after before correcting.

I do think that the dilution is a major problem as you pointed out, and the major ESO‚Äôs will continue to be a weight on the price also. I do wish that management would take a slight pay cut until we get some profitable years, but I don‚Äôt see that happening. I think the executive compensation is a problem that does get overlooked heavily with this stock unfortunately. Your analysis on the competition is spot on also, however I do classify them as somewhat of a differentiator personally. The way their business model brings people in and sinks their hooks in will create many repeat contracts for sure. 

All in all, I see Palantir going 1 or two ways.. they get their shit together, possibly make a few strong M&A acquisitions on their way to 1T, or they fail to become profitable and become a target for M&A. Their product is to valuable to not be employed."

2021-07-02 00:52:27,wallstreetbets,"They were 78% efficacy. A far cry from the other vaccine companies who had 94-96%. Also that 100% you were talking about is on the original strain which is almost nonexistent in around the world. They will need up to date numbers on the Delta varient. 

But the fact is it's been proven that inactivated vaccines have actually done very bad against the mutating covid virus. Hence why the Chinese and Russian vaccines aren't working very well and there are outbreaks in countries that solely used them. 


Covaxin has had flawed trails from the start. India approved a vaccine last year with a study only done on 14 people. India is the worst country when it comes to standards. Also Ocgn is only making 45% off a 100 million vaccines that can only be sold on the US. With Pfizer, Moderna, JnJ, and Novavax about to be approved no American. In their right mind would want an Indian vaccine. 

Not to mention market share is dwindling at least of half of Americans are vaccinated leaving 175 million people between 5 companies. Ocgn will not sell through all 100 million leaving a huge gap in valuation where it stands today. Worth 800 million to 1 billion max. 

Also Ocgn needs to convert their facility to a level 2 facility as they are working with inactivated viruses. This is a long bureaucratic process. That in between the FDA wanting another trial done. (As the FDA does not approve based on overseas trials only trials done in the US) this could take up to a year or more to get everything done that is if they get enough people for the trials. It's almost near next to impossible to conduct covert trials right now. Nobody in their right mind wants to take an experimental vaccine when they can take a proven one that will let them travel outside the US.  Many other vaccine companies that were working on trials cited the same issues of not getting enough participants and trials in a lot of people dropping out of trials. If Indians themselves don't even trust their own pharmaceutical industry what makes you think Americans are one going to be guinea pigs for trials in the US?

In one year from now most Americans will be vaccinated and the major players will have all the skin in the game. Ocgn will be lucky to make profit on a quarter of what they need to sell, let alone of they ever get approved. FDA has said they are not taking anymore EUA applications. So Ocgn is a what's away. 

Title is very misleading as you didn't include any of the info I wrote. 

Ocgn investors promoting this false narrotove either are severely uneducated or know the bag their holding is about to get worse and are doing anything they can to prevent that by spreading misinformation. 

Ocgn is extremely overvalued and is basically a scam because their Execs are pushing this narrotove with Baharat when they know the US market will probably not work out for them. 

But Ocgn execs don't mind cashing their shares. If ocgn was really going to blow up don't you think management would hold instead they're selling, and keep pushing you is back they kept saying oh news is coming in a month and not been months and no news. 

Bernie Madoff would be proud of OCGN"

Keep comforting yourself that I'm just a short trying to push the stock down but like I said before, I short nothing. Unlimited losses do not appeal to me in anyway shape or form no matter the possible upside.

I have 2 stocks in my portfolio that are nothing but shares and they are GME and AMC. I sell covered calls on AMC weekly at ridiculous premiums that the HF's wont allow to end ITM and even if they did all that would happen is I'd lose my whopping 100 shares and still make money vs what I paid. That's the extent of my ""investing""."
2021-07-02 15:46:07,wallstreetbets,"  Short answer yes. Compared to fracking for natural gas though it doesn't compare.  

  The biggest downside of lithium mining is it's enormous consumption of water and the amount of time it takes. It's mined similarly to fracking but without adding harmful chemicals, though they do use some, I'm not familiar with the specifics other than they are considered to be harmless compared to the chemicals and acids of fracking. They also don't actually fracture the underlying rocks. To put it simply they pump a shit ton of water into the ground and allow it to soak up plethora of elements which is pushed to the surface. Then it's just an extremely long evaporation and chemical reaction process between what's been pulled out of the ground to end up with the pure lithium. Like pulling salt from salt water but a MUCH longer process."

2021-07-02 11:43:55,wallstreetbets,"Sure. As mentioned above ""despite recent reports"" refers to recent YoY revenue growth which was affected by Covid-related business closures and Asia channel exits. Because, Paysafe just went public, most people are only looking at that year but if you including that performance with prior years, they were growing 18% CAGR which is on par with PYPL. Prior to that year they were growing 28% CAGR.

Bill Foley's tendency to downplay his projections and then exceed most expectations is something that came up a lot when I first started researching him.  In this case, he appears to be following the same pattern.  Their growth projections seem intentionally conservative as they don't include ongoing US iGaming expansion. Nor do they include M&A growth that is apparently on deck.  Moreover, from the beginning, Foley has been extremely quiet about Paysafe and has done extremely little PR to boost it.  He's said explicitly that he doesn't care about the short term traders so he is not interested in hyping up a stock.  He is all about the long term play, and by all accounts, he delivers."

2021-07-02 05:23:06,wallstreetbets,"But do server cpu's need to scale up? Power efficiency is super important in the server industry, we mostly need loads of cores at 2 to 3ghz and we're set. Intel's flagship Xeon processor has a baseclock of 2ghz (40 cores!) it's probable that there's no competition just yet, because a server is a lot more than just the clock speed and the core count, but ARM is a big dark cloud over the industry. The industry is in prime position to switch to other CPU architectures, not saying it's guaranteed going to happen, but there's a very real possibility it will. Especially if ARM server CPU's can show significant power savings while maintaining similar performance in server workloads."
2021-07-02 02:00:52,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you have a full grasp of what you are talking about. The deal is still pending and even without it nvidia is already a strong partner with arm and using their product.

Nvidia doesn't want to get into commodity cpu design, they're all about special purpose ai Chips for training and inference."
2021-07-02 16:28:49,wallstreetbets,"Source? ARM is a direct competitor to RISC-V, and RISC-V is open source. Why would Nvidia be investing in something they can not get any licensing fees for when they are paying 40 billion dollars to get licensing fees?

\*edit\* Keep in mind, I'm talking about the business aspect. I'm super into RISC-V because I'm super into open source, but I cannot see an argument for Nvidia supporting it. They hate open standards, but if you know something I don't please share."
2021-07-02 17:22:42,wallstreetbets,"Not true. Nvidia wants to control all GPU compute, and with the Arm acquisition it's easy to see they just want to control the datacenter completely. They already HAVE made general purpose CPU's and with the Arm deal plus projected future cost benefits of Arm in the data center they want the entire pie."
2021-07-02 16:43:21,wallstreetbets,"> Source?

https://riscv.org/members/

Nvidia is now a strategic member. As I said, ARM might be the most hyped CPU ISA for the next few years, but leadership at Nvidia aren't retards and they are willing to bet on future technologies."
2021-07-02 16:56:43,wallstreetbets,"And being open source doesn't necessarily mean free as in beer. Nvidia could sell RISC-V chips that are designed by them. This is a bit different situation than open source software, because it takes a fab to actually make the chips. Think it more like a Red Hat linux situation than some small hobby project in GitHub."

That's how I justify it in my head anyways.  That and NVDA is constantly making new markets in things like cloud gaming, autonomous vehicles, rendering,  and whatever it is they announced this week at ISC."
2021-07-02 12:20:52,wallstreetbets,"Luckily the Xilinx acquisition will hide a bit of the slowing growth just due to the extra costs and revenue coming from them. It will give the company an excuse to not aim for crazier 50% yoy growth, and surprise investors whenever they do outperform."

2021-07-01 23:20:06,wallstreetbets,That is the logical thing to do. One never rushes space travel of any sort. NASA can attest to this too many times. SPCE's and blue origin's dick measuring contest can lead to a disasterous results if literally everything isn't perfect. I hope they don't underestimate space and space travel and the likes

2021-07-02 00:41:19,wallstreetbets,"Grid EV is not very likely to work well for trucking for a myriad of reasons. The energy demand alone would be astronomical to quickly charge a bank of batteries capable of moving freight across large countries such as the US. The batteries would add immense weight to the trucks. An electric rail system would be feasible, but would need to be the largest infrastructure project in the history of the world to totally replace trucking. Hydrogen fuel cells are going to be the answer eventually, but I think the most likely contender for electrification of trucking is actually natural gas fuel cells, which is going to need CNG infrastructure in place. Eventually, steam reformation could be done on a small scale at existing fueling sites to offer hydrogen and CNG. Once we have electrical generation available to efficiently generate hydrogen from water, CNG will be obsolete, but that may be 50-100 years from now.

I'm taking baby steps before I try an Iron Condor, I saw that on a Schwab commercial.

I'm just asking about the fundamentals not the strategy. Do I understand correctly you made $4 a share? How are you paid for shares nether you or the seller owns? Does the seller have to buy them from the broker and pay $20 for shares that are only worth $16; then the broker gives you the difference less commission. If you know of a site that explains the fundamentals to a beginner I'll take it.

2021-07-01 20:46:35,wallstreetbets,"this is my first time selling covered calls, do you have any tips? What expiration/strike price do you like doing?"
2021-07-01 21:43:54,wallstreetbets,"AMC is very lucrative right now due to high IV as you are already aware. Because of the high IV i find selling strikes 25-30% OTM (for example $70 strike based on current amc price) very safe, and if you do 15-20 DTE you can collect 6-9% premiums depending on IV levels.

So based on current amc prices i am selling $70-$75 strikes for 2-3 weeks expiration and i buy them back during the last week when they are down 80% because the remaining 20% takes way too long to melt away.

My fail safe tactic with amc is that if AMC reaches my strike price, I will instantly buy my contracts back (for higher price than i sold them for) and then I will simultaneously sell new calls sith strikes for $10-$15 higher ($80-$85 range) while adding 2 or 3 weeks of time on them so that i can essentially move my strike higher without losing money, and this way i can keep making money on my amc stack as price passes $70, rather than having my profits capped at $70 strike and having the stocks called away.

Hope that helps mate good luck!

Rolling out and up is a great way to ensure you stocks done get called away just keep in mind you will have to sacrifice another 2-3 weeks in order to roll that strike higher without losing money"
2021-07-01 22:42:35,wallstreetbets,"thanks! I will try out 2-3 weeks away and buying back the last week when they are down a lot. 

Are there any other high IV stocks that you're doing this with or know of that's this lucrative?"
2021-07-01 23:16:31,wallstreetbets,"Same boat as you my friend first time selling covered calls with amc (been taking advantage of it for a month now since we bounced of $72 i've been raking in money from high iv dropping and theta decay) Like i said earlier the main thing is to rollout and out if amc touches your strike price, to avoid getting your stocks assigned and limiting max orofit potential.

If you head over to thetagang, hundreds of people selling CCs when amc was in the $11-14 range got all their stock assigned and didn't make any profit past amc going over $14+. We need to avoid this at all costs.

As for other stocks i plan on wheeling a few tickers such as amd, msft, fb and dkng after amc is done with. It might take months to hit our final squeeze so i will have to evaluate high iv stocks whenever that times comes because many stock opportunities for writing CCs or running the wheel strategy will drastically change by the time we are finished milking amc"

2021-07-01 22:46:44,wallstreetbets,Eyyy you on Business Insider homie. Wall Street knows about us and they know we see through their shitty plays
2021-07-02 09:36:55,wallstreetbets,"Love this. I hate bear investors especially ones like Burry who got it right once and think they are the end all be all.

Ask Warren Buffet how going long has been working‚Ä¶."
2021-07-02 09:50:13,wallstreetbets,The market is chugging along just fine because unnatural government forces are keeping it chugging. Without that Burry is probably right.

2021-07-02 19:42:04,wallstreetbets," He says crash is coming almost everyday so theoretically when a crash actually occurs, he was right. Flawed logic"
2021-07-02 06:54:12,wallstreetbets,"and thats one of the problems with shorting.

you can stay long much more easily than staying short in a position."

2021-07-02 03:30:45,wallstreetbets,"October 1987- Black Monday. 
October 1989- Friday the 13th crash 
July 1990- Early 90s recession 
March 2000- Dot Com bubble 
Sept 2001- 9/11 
2007- Beginning of Financial crisis
May 2010- flash crash
2015- Massive sell-off (10 trillion gone from the market)
And lastly the 2020 pandemic crash.

I'm not sure if you've been paying attention"
2021-07-02 03:36:50,wallstreetbets,He was correct on both Dot Com bubble and sub prime.   He regularly was up double digits compared to the % of change of the S&P every year that he ran Scion Capital before going just private.
2021-07-02 01:08:29,wallstreetbets,"I think you are nitpicking now! I never said he is always right and I think he mumbles plenty of horseshit actually. 
My ‚Äölogic‚Äò is that this post here ignores that Burry was off the radar for a long time and does not look into what he did inbetween or before he became of fame. It‚Äôs just not enough to make a claim on if he‚Äôs right or wrong. 

Also: he was invested mainly in value plays over the last 3-4 years but his tone and strategy shifted in 2020. 
puts on TSLA, puts on bond indexes, inflation hedges AS WELL AS value stocks. 

If one would have followed his 13Fs the past few years, yes, you would have made a serious profit. 

I think he has placed his bets now and we can only wait and see what time will tell. We can only make a statement on whether he was right or wrong on hyperinflation and that ETFs destroy price discovery after the fact. Let‚Äôs just give it another year and come back to this, shall we?

!Remindme! In one year"
2021-07-01 22:54:02,wallstreetbets,"Makes sense, that's probably where afr got it from."
2021-07-02 13:29:18,wallstreetbets,"""Show me your O-maha face!"""
2021-07-02 14:48:08,wallstreetbets,"One could argue though the value of money has definitely gone up. I think we‚Äôve seen hyper deflation over the last hundred years. For example, we think rising food prices is inflation, however, we know for the last 100 years, death rates from hunger has gone down consistently along with poverty rate. I remember reading somewhere that the access to goods and services a middle class person has today is equivalent to that of Rockefeller during his time. An example of this can be easily seen in the near future as well with space tourism. Today it may be in the hundreds of thousands to millions to make it to space. In 50 years, you may have that become so accessible that you‚Äôll see high schoolers do this as a first date. This accessibility to me is huge deflation and I think this is why over the course of 30 years, we‚Äôve seen interest rates go down this far... but I‚Äôm just a retard and have no financial education so I‚Äôm probably missing a lot of very important details"
2021-07-02 18:09:24,wallstreetbets,"Deflation is inherent in an industrially advancing civilization. As production becomes more efficient because of technology, we all enjoy the spoils of the increased efficiency. Inflation, on other hand, destroy capital- to save the work you done today ($$$$ purchasing power) for tomorrow, the common man is forced into highly risky speculation, because simply holding the dollars (Purchasing Power) the value diminishes each day with inflation. If a your grandma saved her hard work for her grandchildren, in a sock, today the money would be near worthless. 

The value of money has not gone up, the efficiency of production has gone up. 

This is evident on how the .gov measures the Consumer Price Inflation basket, all useful factors have been removed, and remaining are mostly deflationary goods, such as flat screen TV's, that will be much much cheaper each year because of tech advance, and then they claim ""Look, CPI says there's little inflation"". 

The things that you can't just produce more of, or print, such as land (real estate), are rocketing in price because of value of money falling."
