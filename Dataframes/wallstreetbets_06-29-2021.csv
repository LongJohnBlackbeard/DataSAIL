2021-06-29 19:53:50,wallstreetbets,Best way to get people to buy more..
2021-06-29 19:50:24,wallstreetbets,"Same warning as all volatility stocks like, AMC and GameStop and other companies said the same thing .. short squeeze will happen they just said “be ready for the decline”"
2021-06-29 19:54:26,wallstreetbets,Don’t believe anything you read on MF!
2021-06-29 19:52:18,wallstreetbets,Sold at 25 but I’ve been thinking of getting back in…
2021-06-29 19:47:29,wallstreetbets,"Basically the same warning GME and AMC issued. This stock has the best numbers in my opinion of all the meme stocks for squeeze potential. It has a very high SI, a very high cost to borrow those shares, and it’s trading closer to its intrinsic value than any of the squeeze potential targets it seems. So more upside and less downside potential in my opinion. Plenty of analysts have a higher target than its trading at now. Disclosure I’m long shares. Also the obligatory 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-29 19:49:52,wallstreetbets,"Do NOT believe in anything from motley fools, they are owned by Citadel and are paid to spread FUD."
2021-06-29 19:56:29,wallstreetbets,"This article is the perspective of a short seller. Personally, I only invested in the stock BECAUSE of the short squeeze potential. Because it’s going to soar when shorts start covering en masse! Not worried at all!"
2021-06-29 19:57:32,wallstreetbets,Turned $300 into $4500 in calls in 24 hours a couple of weeks ago.  After that I removed the ticker from my stock tracker.  Now waiting for some longer calls on wish and uwmc.
2021-06-29 19:54:34,wallstreetbets,So all the talk about solid DD was just to push an agenda? Tough pill to swallow.
2021-06-29 19:47:53,wallstreetbets,Wow they were honest and that's bad? 🤣
2021-06-29 19:46:46,wallstreetbets,"it’s a shit stock with a sketchy board, and a pump and dump."
2021-06-29 19:58:53,wallstreetbets,That’s what I would do
2021-06-29 19:57:01,wallstreetbets,The CEO may have said those words but it applies to literally ANY ticker.  Companies can go bankrupt overnight for any reason.  IMO the article is a tactic to instill fear in the retail investors heart so they sell and the hedge funds make money on the downside.  Shifty game they play.
2021-06-29 19:51:12,wallstreetbets,Citadel has a large steak in CLOV...
2021-06-29 19:59:44,wallstreetbets,I love you retard and need your brain
2021-06-29 19:56:17,wallstreetbets,Its Theranos that's publicly traded.
2021-06-29 19:53:45,wallstreetbets,I love steak.
2021-06-29 19:52:27,wallstreetbets,They aren’t one of the top 30 shareholders and they also own a big position in Amc.
2021-06-29 19:53:50,wallstreetbets,Yes that’s true. But when comparing % of the float they have a much larger stake in AMC.
2021-06-29 19:55:59,wallstreetbets,It’s steak bro... stick with the theme.

2021-06-29 19:55:25,wallstreetbets,SPCE to the moon. Hotel Encanto is booked (blacked out) from July 5th to the 11th for a Virgin Galactic event. It looks like a serious potential for a Sir Richard Branson flight on July 10th
2021-06-29 19:40:08,wallstreetbets,"That is many years out. Reasonable thesis but won't be a catalyst for some time. 

They already have an air travel company at Virgin so don't be so sure this will fall under Galactic."
2021-06-29 19:42:51,wallstreetbets,You do know that vaporware companies like this only go public during a bubble right?
2021-06-29 19:35:17,wallstreetbets,I really don’t understand why this is not okay
2021-06-29 19:42:42,wallstreetbets,I got this thesis from various articles talking about Galactic
2021-06-29 19:45:02,wallstreetbets,I think that this already beyond Vaporware. They have already received the commercial license and soon to operate commercially
2021-06-29 19:49:00,wallstreetbets,This is what people said about Nikola and Lordstown

2021-06-29 19:44:41,wallstreetbets,Supposed to be their best earnings report ever... could easily break a new ATH in premarket thursday. I'm in with 10k.
2021-06-29 19:59:54,wallstreetbets,what you think its going to hit? personally hoping I wake up thursday to it going over 95 but I'll be very happy if it even hits 90 - lots analysts saying it could hit well over 100 in the coming months. Im very positive about this one

If you time it right you'll see nice gains and if not you'll lose your ass. This is all hype and OP got in at the right time, its stay the fuck away territory at this stage unless you're banking on the potential good news stories covering Sir Richard's flight...folks aren't really lining up for space rides like they want you to believe, the list of 600 they mention is the same group since 2018."

They get very excited to sell very quickly and buy back two dollar less. In fact I know someone that sold at $34 and was waiting for the stock to go to $30 so he can rebuy it. Two days later, he watched it going to $57. Timing the market is the dumbest thing"

2021-06-29 19:48:12,wallstreetbets,"Today they were ambushed again 2nd time in a week with bad news short sellers keep busy the financial journos and pundits to find serious issues in a speculative negative way . TSLA will end above $720 this week after sales report is released , when Crammer predicted this a month ago , he said Buy TSLA because a great report will come this Thursday or Friday don’t panic yet .."

2021-06-29 18:47:50,wallstreetbets,This lawsuit has been there for over a month now advertised heavily everywhere. Old news!
2021-06-29 19:39:11,wallstreetbets,"That came out the day before, don’t think it was the lawsuit. Just shaking out weak shareholders. But volume dried up today. Notice every down day it’s on lesser volume than previous day. Always happens before major run ups. Wait for the rip and it will be on higher volume. That’s how you know we’re not only moving in the right direction, but with conviction. Count on it. And you, me and everybody except Uncle Vlad will be getting our dicks sucked by aliens on the moon. Get this bread, this head, then we’re heading to the next pit stop: Mars.👩🏿‍🚀🦍🦍"
2021-06-29 19:44:14,wallstreetbets,These ridiculous shareholder lawsuits pop up when you Google search like half the volatile tickers. Nothing to see at all.

2021-06-29 19:23:07,wallstreetbets,"That news was cooked in back when it dumped from 30 to 10.  Only expect it to get worse.  If you didn't know this, why would you buy the stock?"

2021-06-29 18:50:20,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this is my thought too. Its on to the next one for Reddit, prices will dip and stabilize at a much lower number now and that will last years."
2021-06-29 18:54:54,wallstreetbets,They still wont admit it either lmao
2021-06-29 19:30:36,wallstreetbets,Starting to think you could do a put order on any ticker thats 2 weeks from its initial Reddit hype and it will make solid money.
2021-06-29 18:35:35,wallstreetbets,Just look at the charts and news is irrelevant

I sure remember AMC dropping from 21 to 7

2021-06-29 19:35:46,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Seen so many lawsuits then the stock really pops. Won’t post any ticker but it’s true. Almost like a guarantee buy. Also, I’m very BULLISH ON WISH!"

2021-06-29 17:55:00,wallstreetbets,Nice but I like PGX.   Its boring.   Pays a 5% yield and pays monthly so I get to reinvest every month.   Do your own research.   But I found with the exception of 2008 and last March the ETF had maintained a pretty steady price range.   So far I’m very happy with it.

2021-06-29 19:23:04,wallstreetbets,Idk as much about their exact drugs or methods but they just seen so small and new to justify such a quick price increase this year
2021-06-29 18:05:42,wallstreetbets,"For NTLA the break-though data from Saturday is still in Stage 1, so the process for that will still take years. The most recent CRSP news was a great data drop about a month ago showing perfect results for patients with sickle cell and b-thassamelia.  Both companies tend to release data sporadically every couple of months, and their earning is pretty insignificant because the companies do not have marketable drugs yet. Because of that the only way to be involved in huge days (like last 2 for NTLA) is to hold long and wait for it to happen. I think there could be a small pullback but ultimately i think these companies will mature over the next decade and could be worth at least 4x more than they are now, assuming they aren’t bought out by their partners in large acquisitions. 

Additional point:  i still consider this high risk which is why ive cashed out for more than my cost basis on both so far, but with that said i still allow them to be more than half of my portfolio combined."

2021-06-29 17:47:14,wallstreetbets,"Thanks. If you want to edit the original pictures back in I'm sure people would like to see the summaries too. Definitely don't have to, though"
2021-06-29 18:44:21,wallstreetbets,Lockup expired yesterday. The stock was down 10% on Friday in anticipation of more shares hitting the market. I think we saw some additional selling pressure as well today. I’m long the stock as well and believe it has some good prospects for the future.
2021-06-29 17:59:46,wallstreetbets,I don’t know about that lol
2021-06-29 19:32:58,wallstreetbets,thanks.... that explains the volatility.  how many shares  were unlocked for this lockup?
2021-06-29 19:52:44,wallstreetbets,Not sure the exact amount but it could of been another 5% of what’s outstanding

2021-06-29 17:56:44,wallstreetbets,Forrest Gump reference spoke to the retard in me so I'll blindly follow your dd
2021-06-29 17:53:37,wallstreetbets,"Shit,  Forest Gump comparison. Thats some deep DD."
2021-06-29 18:54:35,wallstreetbets,I have a friend who runs ships in this industry. He says this is the one if you want to get into the oil market right now.
2021-06-29 18:00:46,wallstreetbets,Yeah they look like a solid bet. Also looking into them media wise it seems like they are going to go high. I'm in with you
2021-06-29 18:17:16,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the DD. I saw a separate DD on wsb a couple days ago and bought into RIG. Holding 2000 shares and 20 $4.5 calls exp Aug. Bullish news all around. The trajectory of the stock does follow WTI very closely so tomorrow's OPEC meeting will influence this stock a lot.
2021-06-29 19:24:53,wallstreetbets,"All I read was the first paragraph,  the rest is jiberish.  I'm all in Forest"
2021-06-29 19:57:17,wallstreetbets,I like shrimp and oil. Count me in
2021-06-29 18:04:20,wallstreetbets,"Good writ up, I had a similar one for RIG earlier today as well advocating it as a potential buy. Also, there is a 14% short float out there as well and I'm sure if RIG starts to gain strength, those need to cover. How much more lower can your shorts go? RIG is not going to  bankrupt especially given the increase in the oil price."
2021-06-29 18:24:57,wallstreetbets,"All the OPEC nations are heavily dependent on a high oil price to satisfy many domestic spending.  With the price currently hovering around $73 a barrel, they'll be fools to jeopardize that.  Oil price is in a bullish trend, which bolds well for RIG."
2021-06-29 18:20:36,wallstreetbets,"I’m short Puts, I’m long delta"
2021-06-29 18:33:30,wallstreetbets,"There's a significant deficit right now in oil production vs demand and OPEC hasn't resumed full production. They will definitely raise output, it's just a matter of how much. Analysts are anticipating up to 1 million barrels a day. If OPEC decides to phase in the million over 3 months, that would be bullish. Immediate production rise create short term pullback but over long run, 80+ WTI by mid summer is possible."
2021-06-29 18:57:56,wallstreetbets,"That's a fine play, although you need to be pretty high level trader for them to let you do that. Personally, not wanting to track it on a daily basis, I bought 10K shares and probably will pick up 100 or 200 LEAP contract later."
2021-06-29 18:59:05,wallstreetbets,"You need lvl 2 options to sell cash secured puts, wtf are you talking about"
2021-06-29 19:04:06,wallstreetbets,"I thought you need to be higher than that. Well my Merrill Lynch account doesn't let me do that, I guess I'm not worthy yet in their eyes."
2021-06-29 19:36:28,wallstreetbets,"If you can throw in on 10k worth or shares, you have the capital to sell puts. You have to apply for a higher options level"

2021-06-29 17:58:12,wallstreetbets,Thats a good amount of shares. Sell some covered calls to lower your basis

2021-06-29 18:24:58,wallstreetbets,Why not sell 40 puts for July 16th @ 12 for .75? Pocket 3k and if you get assigned then you're in 30 cents cheaper (or 1.05 cheaper depending on how you view it)?
2021-06-29 17:27:57,wallstreetbets,580 comments… I need to get a life.
2021-06-29 18:06:01,wallstreetbets,I've been slowly collecting berries since last year! This is a gold mind waiting to be unearthed!

Im hoping for a spike, these stocks seem to rise when the analysts downgrade them, it’s a bizarre scene right now! Let’s hope we can get some profits here!"
2021-06-29 19:42:22,wallstreetbets,That is definitely on the table!
2021-06-29 18:30:28,wallstreetbets,What happens when that trade goes tits up?

2021-06-29 19:32:41,wallstreetbets,Lol… timing is so painful. I sold TTD right before that $7 spike last week.
2021-06-29 18:36:29,wallstreetbets,OP keeps the premium and doesn't own BB stock.
2021-06-29 19:41:45,wallstreetbets,These are good strats for sure.

2021-06-29 19:25:48,wallstreetbets,You know what's worse than that? You caught those stocks but didn't sell hoping for higher return ended up holding bags. Which is me by the way.

2021-06-29 19:50:38,wallstreetbets,Looking at the chart and pressing a buy or sell button based on the price will get you nowhere. Turn on some indicators for the love of god and draw your horizontal lines to mark the levels of support and resistance. After trend lines and look for something. And be fucking strong in your head. Thats your new relion.
2021-06-29 17:52:54,wallstreetbets,"How does one hold too long and also miss the boat? If you were holding, then you were on the boat, right?"
2021-06-29 19:25:49,wallstreetbets,"Thats like 98% of this sub. 

The VAST majority of people here stopped making any money when it became apparent in feb/march that this sub was being gamed now. 

And those that get lucky, hold too long expecting huge gains or lose it on the next gamble. 

This place is a shell of a shell of its former self. It was gambling before, but now its straight up a slot machine."

2021-06-29 17:09:10,wallstreetbets,"I think thats a bit far out yet. Shipbuilding/refitting is a long process, as well as there still being the need to develop the tech further and needing the existing ships to continue operating during the change over. 25 years if i had to make a not-so-educated guess"

2021-06-29 17:37:27,wallstreetbets,Both options of solar and wind are literally dogshit for logistics. How the fuck you gonna power a steamship liner or 18 wheeler and keep it moving daily.
2021-06-29 17:27:47,wallstreetbets,"Its clearly on the decline in rail, coal traffic is down 28% yoy. Most of the coal that is shipped by the Norfolk Southern is actually exported."

2021-06-29 17:40:24,wallstreetbets,I'm mainly referring to Wyoming powder river basin coal which apart from this years commodity price boom has been in steady decline since the Obama administration.
2021-06-29 19:33:58,wallstreetbets,"Do you know anything about sailing? We aren’t talking pirate ships here. A ship with modern sailing equipment would be every bit as fast as a diesel electric cargo ship today. There’s actually many proposals for modern sailing vessels being floated as we speak. A bunch of them look more like spaceships than regular container ships. Most are auxiliary sails. Theres container ships right now that fly a giant parachute thing to go downwind. Because of how shipping works most of these ships basically idle across the ocean because it barely matters how fast the load of McDonald’s toys and actual trash get across anyway. There’s also proposals for blimps which would be much faster than any other form of shipping and would need almost no power at all. And yes, I’m a little high."
2021-06-29 18:55:10,wallstreetbets,"They can switch to shipping other commodity goods, like aggregate, ore etc. It’s a bit like shorting farmers who grow soy beans, they are good at adapting."
2021-06-29 18:40:20,wallstreetbets,Gotcha. Was gonna say that freight by rail is booked solid right now. Supply chain shocks were real this year lol.
2021-06-29 19:53:37,wallstreetbets,"The capacity vs expense would be insane, along with the lead time of the vessel arriving. 

For ships to be profitable, they need as quick entrance and exit to ports as possible. The longer a container vessel is out to sea, the less profitable it is. 
I work in the logistics industry, and pretty much every major ocean line is purchasing modern diesel ships that will take 3-6 years to arrive on market. 

I don’t doubt that someone will eventually make a more eco friendly container vessel, but it’s a long long time out before it becomes reality. Anyone who’s currently running “eco” friendly is running such a small cargo ship that it’s essentially irrelevant to the broader market."
2021-06-29 18:54:33,wallstreetbets,"Long term im not optimistic about rail, I'm a freight broker, railroads are some of the hardest people to deal with. Autonomous trucks are already being used in Arizona they have someone on board but once they can run without Union Pacific better realize 30% profit margins are un realistic."
2021-06-29 19:58:56,wallstreetbets,"Same bro. Happy holiday week 🤪 

I really think it’s just the same issue as everywhere. Not enough capacity, too much product, and the way you sort through that is raise rates to where the product that needs to move immediately will pay the cost to be at the front of the line. Rail is still decently cheap compared to van rates though. Sucks trying to get anything on it tho lol

Don’t see autonomous trucks getting anywhere in the near future. They’ll still need a driver in it like you said. Plus i don’t want to think about insurance claims with an autonomous vehicle. And the tech is still pretty trash for anything that’s got shade and hills. Aka outside of Arizona lol"

Chatted with the rep at Schwab trading desk and that’s what they charge if they can located the shares. The last time I saw an equivalent rate was with GME in Feb. This rate jives with the other sources reporting +100% short borrowing rates.

2021-06-29 18:08:24,wallstreetbets,"Great TA! 

SoFi is posed for a breakout in a parabolic run-up. We all know that the fundamentals of the company are incredible and the reason people and institution invest in it, but good technical breakdown is very welcome."
2021-06-29 17:58:31,wallstreetbets,Cup'n'handle formed AH. Breakout looking very bullish
2021-06-29 19:33:50,wallstreetbets,SOFI still huh 🤔
2021-06-29 18:29:24,wallstreetbets,"I read something about a Triangle.

I'm in. Feels early enough to be the bottom."
2021-06-29 18:53:52,wallstreetbets,Yolod everything but my rblx calls and viac/CBS calls into 300 shares
2021-06-29 19:38:53,wallstreetbets,Sir Jack has 100.000 shares that definitely agree with this analysis
2021-06-29 16:54:35,wallstreetbets,But what do the tea leaves say? It’s good to balance perspectives.
2021-06-29 18:22:17,wallstreetbets,$18 to $24 tomorrow or this week?? Wishful thinking…and I like $SOFI.
2021-06-29 17:22:16,wallstreetbets,Gme only ftw
2021-06-29 17:27:12,wallstreetbets,Technical Analysis is voodoo bullshit
2021-06-29 18:02:03,wallstreetbets,What strike are you targeting for August calls?
2021-06-29 19:38:03,wallstreetbets,This is dumb. Come on guys.
2021-06-29 17:19:54,wallstreetbets,Fuck sofi gay ass sounding ticker lmao
2021-06-29 17:19:10,wallstreetbets,I’ll send you $100 if it closes 25 eow.
2021-06-29 19:29:14,wallstreetbets,Pretty much can’t hold her back. She’s going full on Karen
2021-06-29 19:44:46,wallstreetbets,Clov at 130% fees per iborrowdesk at the moment
2021-06-29 17:54:48,wallstreetbets,Rule #1: Never buy options at open...
2021-06-29 17:01:14,wallstreetbets,Stay out of rangebound markets - I bet you are playing July calls. Until we breakout - if you really like the stock - best to do shares or august+ calls.
2021-06-29 18:55:12,wallstreetbets,Did SOFI talk dirty to you while she was getting pile drived by the hudge funds?
2021-06-29 17:39:05,wallstreetbets,Unbiased perspectives are a rare thing on WSB
2021-06-29 17:04:06,wallstreetbets,"No... that's just what it would take to break out tomorrow. This setup is valid until we cross above that red trendline, or below the lower one."
2021-06-29 19:20:32,wallstreetbets,"Maybe a cup that a mentally retarded child with parkinson's made in pottery class, but yes - I see it clear as day."
2021-06-29 17:27:52,wallstreetbets,My teats are saying that SoFi will have 10 million trillion in revenue by 2023 so it is a BUY
2021-06-29 19:47:02,wallstreetbets,Thats not what I was saying
2021-06-29 19:21:38,wallstreetbets,It's almost at 20 right now.
2021-06-29 17:23:36,wallstreetbets,609 shares reporting in and holding you accountable. !RemindMe one week
2021-06-29 18:23:03,wallstreetbets,Especially when that open is up.
2021-06-29 17:10:32,wallstreetbets,"No I'm not touching that trash until the shorts back the fuck up. All in $MU calls tomorrow. Getting my -$2,100 back and some from my baby $MU. $NIO just broke $50, I'd be watching that rather than watching $SOFI shorts clap everyone's cheeks this week. I don't doubt there will be a break, but there is no consolidation or footing yet. Just Short action. Might find a good level by Friday. Who knows. Fuck that shit. Acts just like $AMC. Nothing but short action and IV crush."

2021-06-29 17:00:30,wallstreetbets,I would have went all in with the $85 strike for July 09th instead of shares....🖍🖍🖍🖍🖍🦍
2021-06-29 17:05:17,wallstreetbets,"I went in on calls expiring on 7/2, 7/9, 7/16 and 9/17. I hope it pops after earnings as well. May sell some tomorrow to cover my ass a bit if it has momentum. It's about to eat up the loss today in after hours.

edit: Damn. It just took back everything it lost today. Up $.02 in after hours at 5:30."

2021-06-29 17:39:47,wallstreetbets,I'm even more retarded because I trade on robinhood.
2021-06-29 17:53:00,wallstreetbets,"Probably notifying you their earnings report is coming out.

What should have been a sure-bet is risky because of all the mixed focus on wall street atm"
2021-06-29 17:43:17,wallstreetbets,"Aw, no worries Mate, I recognized the layout there as etrade. Same as me. I was hoping maybe someone could answer. I had RH, but I transfered out, now I'm learning ET. Thanks for come back. Cheers"
2021-06-29 17:54:09,wallstreetbets,"OK, that sounds reasonable. Thanks Mate!
Cheers"
2021-06-29 17:46:31,wallstreetbets,"Ok, thanks. I will try to figure special event meaning. I have 2 different flags, thought maybe it meant they were loaning those stocks. This is keeping my retarded Ape ass busy. Cheers"

2021-06-29 17:27:49,wallstreetbets,That's sounds like a pretty big stretch.  Do they have similar diversification in customer offerings?

2021-06-29 17:07:26,wallstreetbets,🖐🙄 *Guilty*
2021-06-29 16:57:11,wallstreetbets,"Oh shit, so that document allowed them to register 5,000,000 more shares, and now they're withdrawing it, effectively making their pool of shares smaller. Which is usually a good thing for shareholders, as it makes currently issued and outstanding shares less diluted, i.e. more valuable.

2021-06-29 16:20:26,wallstreetbets,Starlink hasn't done an IPO. Unsure how this is market moving.
2021-06-29 16:21:30,wallstreetbets,Is starlink also gonna do an IPO?
2021-06-29 16:39:38,wallstreetbets,Dude. Even musk kinda admits starlink is more likely to fail than not.
2021-06-29 16:43:19,wallstreetbets,"The problem with SpaceX+Starlink is that you're betting on StarLink's success as much as SpaceX's, whereas with Virgin Orbit you're betting on space in general."

2021-06-29 18:25:45,wallstreetbets,"I don't think it will, not in this environment. Starlink is an old idea that's failed multiple times but it's musk so it's new and fresh. They'll have nearly unlimited funds from the market when they IPO."

2021-06-29 16:40:02,wallstreetbets,Vizio is a 100% buy and undervalued.

2021-06-29 17:47:49,wallstreetbets,"All in on $CLOV bc:

(1) SI and CTB are stupidly high atm so squeeze could happen ([CLOV specifically mentions the possibility of a short squeeze in a recent SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521194275/d184468dposam.htm)).

(2) [Golden Cross](https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/active-investor/moving-averages) on the daily (50 EMA crossing above 100 EMA).

(3) [Insiders have performance based stocks that vest upon share price reaching $20, $25, and $30 for 90 consecutive calendar days](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521008124/d63659d424b3.htm). So risk of share dilution etc. is very unlikely.

(4) I like the stock. B of A has a PT of $10 while JP Morgan has PT of $15. It current price is justified given the fundamentals (that’s not accounting for meme status, FOMO, etc.) 

(5) I think Hindenburg report is more likely a nothingburger. DoJ makes inquiries into legit blue-chip companies regularly (e.g., [Google](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-monopolist-google-violating-antitrust-laws)). Doesn’t necessarily mean anything. 

Lastly, an AH Ortex update:

I think China will experience major issues and population decline after that is hit. One they have so few women that men outnumber them like 3 to 1 so babies will be hard to make. They also have a population that is aging rapidly which means the huge workforce they have now will only be a fraction of what it is.


If my China plays work out I'm going to parody ""The China Hustle"" but call it ""The Retard Hustle"""

2021-06-29 17:59:38,wallstreetbets,"Adding on more WISH options for August and October at open. As of today's close, WISH's EV/revenue has improved from December from 12.15 to 2.5. Lower is better; it means improving revenue and/or declining debts. Amazon in the same period went from  13.14 to 4.12. I entered two weeks ago at a price slightly below where it is today (essentially even with last weeks trading range after the Monday pump and dump).

Analysts are already ticking up on the expected revenue for the earnings report on August just on the improvements in the economies that are getting vaccinated. As things open up more lower income workers return to work, and they're WISH's primary demographic. This means a strong chance for an earnings beat.

This is a solid runner to 25 on a fair value play. Actual memeing as opposed to locusts running pump and dumps under the mods' noses can carry this past 30 easily."

Using the rifle charts on weekly and daily time frames provides a broader view of the landscape for CLNE stock. The weekly rifle chart illustrated how shares peaked at the $19.69 Fibonacci (fib) level and collapsed down to the $7.50s level before coiling back up on the weekly market structure low (MSL) buy trigger when shares rose through $8.18. The weekly 5-period moving average (MA) support is rising at $10.12 as it forms a channel tightening towards the weekly 15-period MA at $10.93. The weekly stochastic crossed up through the 20-band. The weekly market structure high (MSH) triggered under the $14.01 level. The daily rifle chart has peaked off the $14.34 fib and is starting to appear to break down as the stochastic forms a bearish mini inverse pup lower. The daily 5-period MA is crossing down at the 15-period MA at $11.08 potentially causing a breakdown towards the daily lower Bollinger Bands (BBs) down at the $7.08 price level. Prudent investors can scale into opportunistic pullback levels at the $10.49 fib, $9.89 fib, $9.29 fib, $8.98 fib, $8.18 fib, $7.29 fib, and the $6.46 fib. The upside trajectories range from the $13.32 fib up towards the $17.17 fib level."

2021-06-29 18:03:31,wallstreetbets,What makes SOFI a pump and dump? Do they not have profitability and potential growth? Do you realize yesterdays move was because their lockup ended from their merge?
2021-06-29 18:00:40,wallstreetbets,"If you consider that the top, or even a pump, then you haven’t even looked at the chart."

SoFi has a place next to the SQ and PYPL of the world. Their platform is fantastic and will continue drawing customers (likely with small accounts). Their biggest growth driver has been refinancing student loans as a relationship starter"

2021-06-29 19:43:37,wallstreetbets,Most girls in the gym just want to be left alone so maybe just let her work out in peace
2021-06-29 19:43:18,wallstreetbets,You can't. She has to approach you. The gym is neutral territory for women. It's poor form to approach women at the gym. She has to come to you
2021-06-29 19:48:45,wallstreetbets,Just stare at her while she uses the machine. She’ll figure it out.
2021-06-29 19:42:17,wallstreetbets,"""those are some toned glutes you got there, mind if I spot you?"""
2021-06-29 19:55:29,wallstreetbets,"Tell her that your all in on CLOV, if she calls you a retard, you're all good."
2021-06-29 19:49:06,wallstreetbets,"She’s there to work out. Don’t talk to her while she’s in her workout. If you want to time it so you leave around the same time and find some way to start convo then, but don’t be that guy that interrupts her workout lol"
2021-06-29 19:45:01,wallstreetbets,"Unless she’s throwing looks at you, smiling, etc. don’t do shit. 

You can test the waters by like pretending to want to use the machine or something, or say forgetting your water bottle or something, in order to manufacture an interaction.  Unless she gives you some indication, like she starts a conversation, laughs slightly too much at nothing, smiles a lot, keeps looking back, or initiates conversation again/acknowledged you again later, you’re outta luck."
2021-06-29 19:52:47,wallstreetbets,"It’s pretty easy, she’s a human being and is probably pretty boring. If you see her frequently at the gym say hello as you pass by. After 5-6 times just walk up to her and start a conversation. “Hey, I notice you’re here at similar times as me and I think it’s weird that I don’t know your name. My name is Vaseline105.” Then you can start teasing her if she shows up late or beats you there."
2021-06-29 19:46:12,wallstreetbets,"Just make small talk man. Do you see her there regularly? If so, small talk on the daily goes a long way to getting in them panties. Find the opportunity and don’t fucking blow it"
2021-06-29 19:48:27,wallstreetbets,Ask her if she thinks Doja Cat is the John Lennon of our time
2021-06-29 19:48:45,wallstreetbets,"Strike up a casual conversation about exercise/workout, if it goes well then maybe she's into you. You can litterly start with ""This workout is beating me, I might have to take a short brake"" and then if she responds you got a conversation started."
2021-06-29 19:44:55,wallstreetbets,Girls like confidence just be honest and say you think she’s pretty or some shit and ask for her number

2021-06-29 16:20:20,wallstreetbets,Because it's cool to stick it to the man.  At the same time I think there is the same number of people shorting as there always was.  They just got diluted by the huge influx of apes that seem to think this is a team sport.
2021-06-29 16:22:53,wallstreetbets,"That’s what I’m thinking. Was an ape then I started seeing it was actually a cult. Now I want to actually make millions instead of bag holding.

2021-06-29 16:29:06,wallstreetbets,Not sure why you're being downvoted. As soon as these twatter people start pumping whatever stock the best thing you can do is wait about 20 minutes or so for it to max out and short sell about $1k worth of shares and pocket $400 in a few hours.
2021-06-29 16:58:52,wallstreetbets,.....

2021-06-29 17:35:20,wallstreetbets,"This is the wrong type of retarded, sir."
2021-06-29 17:49:12,wallstreetbets,"If the loan has a fixed interest rate considerably lower than your Card Debt APY, yes, take the loan, consolidate, and pay down your debt. Don’t even think about investing again till you have ZERO credit card debt + a minimum 3-6 Months emergency reserve in savings. Bankruptcy is retarded retarded (aka the bad kind), so is investing with money you can’t afford to lose and without a safety net."

2021-06-29 17:47:25,wallstreetbets,The inside ppl that had shares and couldn’t sell for a set amount of time- can sell now. Probroly sold to some firm that’s been slowly dumping them for a couple weeks- keep average up and more profit . Just my opinion

There are more plays than things with high short interest. Better plays. This whole sub is nothing but short interest commentary and it’s real dumb.

2021-06-29 15:54:49,wallstreetbets,Not good enough. They need to be barred from the market for 10 years
2021-06-29 15:52:47,wallstreetbets,A slap on the wrist
2021-06-29 16:01:01,wallstreetbets,"I almost feel the fine was just to say ""Hey see we did something"". More than a Decade of fraud for a multi billion dollar company, and they get fined pennies."
2021-06-29 18:40:22,wallstreetbets,"""But if we fine them, then we stifle innovation!""  bwhahahahahaha

So, rules are great but don't apply if you innovate your way to a violation for  <checks watch> ten years.

I wanna try that excuse in front of a judge.  ""I wasn't speeding your honour.  I was innovating my way to work!""  ""I wasn't stealing, I was innovating my cash flow!"""

2021-06-29 18:11:18,wallstreetbets,Wish will hit 69
2021-06-29 17:25:17,wallstreetbets,IM WITH YOU ON THIS!! Let’s GOOOOO
2021-06-29 18:09:55,wallstreetbets,Bought 200 shares today. Holding through it all 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-29 18:40:24,wallstreetbets,I'm ALL IN 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-29 16:09:03,wallstreetbets,Me too 😏
2021-06-29 15:45:36,wallstreetbets,Undervalued company on many metrics. Hold through the bullshit to get the tendies.
2021-06-29 15:48:37,wallstreetbets,$Wish is the best stock this year. Book it.
2021-06-29 15:47:19,wallstreetbets,Out of powder. Wanted to buy dip
2021-06-29 16:30:35,wallstreetbets,"Tell me bruddahs, how do 7/16 calls look. Mine are at 12.50"
2021-06-29 15:49:33,wallstreetbets,"Best of luck friends. 
Better days are coming!
Let’s go🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-29 15:47:28,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah!!!
2021-06-29 16:32:05,wallstreetbets,"I bought in today. $13.75. The chart looked sexy af, so the trigger got pulled"
2021-06-29 15:51:38,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-29 19:32:28,wallstreetbets,$14.05 gang?
2021-06-29 15:53:15,wallstreetbets,Hold until what? I agree it’s undervalued but what news are you looking for that indicates that we would be nearing the other side of the bs?
2021-06-29 15:59:25,wallstreetbets,"Sell powder, buy all the dips"
2021-06-29 16:49:39,wallstreetbets,"I think that's very possible, if it was me I'd play to at least July 6 and see the post holiday action"
2021-06-29 17:37:24,wallstreetbets,"Mine are for 14, probably shouldve sold when it hit 15 lol."
2021-06-29 16:07:50,wallstreetbets,Profit. That's the one thing that investors are waiting.
2021-06-29 16:00:05,wallstreetbets,I’m not looking for anything. I expect ER to be good and that would be the catalyst.
2021-06-29 16:30:58,wallstreetbets,Price estimates per Factset aggregate are 18+
2021-06-29 15:58:44,wallstreetbets,"I believe that the ""other side"" would be what some call ""profit"""
2021-06-29 19:26:15,wallstreetbets,Ty ty
2021-06-29 19:25:55,wallstreetbets,Yep. I got caught up in the moment and thought 16/17 wasn’t unreasonable
2021-06-29 16:11:30,wallstreetbets,"Got it. Just trying to get my feet wet by jumping into stocks small. So far the ones I’ve bought have definitive catalysts (announcements, reports, etc…) with largely specific dates (beginners stuff) WISH is is the only one I’ve bought because, I too believe, it’s undervalued but I haven’t seen a single thing to indicate if people were holding until Friday, September or 2030? Appreciate the non-sarcastic coherent answer!! Cheers"
2021-06-29 16:33:06,wallstreetbets,"Awesome, thank you!!!"

2021-06-29 19:16:16,wallstreetbets,Prices rises to not quite $100 or just higher in general the contract doubles in price and he makes an easy double up. Or he holds till they expire. This is a casino after all

Polysilicon is the way to go for now, China dominates polysilicon modules. There tends to be a leader of the pack in terms of growth and profit margins and it changes as equipment ages. Trina Solar used to be the star, then JinkoSolar, now CSIQ

Usually they're bangin out 50% earnings growth yoy. 

One word of warning, traders love these Chinese solars and the volatility may make you C-SIQ"

This little five day run has me a little hesitant to buy in right now, but if we get any sort of dip in the next few days I'll probably grab another call option or two."
2021-06-29 15:33:36,wallstreetbets,ok now sell your home and invest it all in a failing company

2021-06-29 16:45:06,wallstreetbets,"I did too, i still think its the right call. 

AMD is at fair value, and a lot of the tech stocks are massively overvalued. The whole tech bubble will pop eventually."

Like you said though, AMD doesn't even need it."
2021-06-29 16:31:02,wallstreetbets,amd isn't failing at all. I'm saying he should invest in a failing company. that's a huge gamble

2021-06-29 15:58:31,wallstreetbets,Anddd the stock is down. Truly baffled that people would push this MLM company.
2021-06-29 15:19:45,wallstreetbets,No it’s not.. But good luck anyway.
2021-06-29 19:45:26,wallstreetbets,My wife has has a subscription to them for years. It's a solid company worth going long on.
2021-06-29 17:13:42,wallstreetbets,It’s a normal spac merger move . Ppl u bought at 9.98 $10 sold for 13 soo normal movement
2021-06-29 16:30:45,wallstreetbets,">ML

For the uneducated like myself, what does MLM mean?"
2021-06-29 15:21:38,wallstreetbets,Well if peloton is over 100+   In couple of years BODY could reach 100+. Body sell equipment cheaper than pelaton.
2021-06-29 15:41:02,wallstreetbets,"And all their equipment is just rebranded junk you can get on Amazon for 1/5 the price. Not that Peloton is much better, but they have high end cachet through quality content and good branding. BeachBody is for people who watch infomercials at 2am and fall for every MLM they see."
2021-06-29 15:28:42,wallstreetbets,All I’m saying is all of these (COVID) stocks that ran up or came out on these great earnings reports are “in my opinion” going to tank when everyone gets back to “Normal” or at least get cut in halve. But I could be wrong just seems logical. Great short term play but not past 2022. Again just my opinion.

2021-06-29 19:59:10,wallstreetbets,"Tesla has mainstream media effect that can move market. Something like a elon effect. Pltr has been moving steadily up, but lacks real volume to spike. With the recent (not substantial evidence) rumors, there is some hope now. And tesla has loads of datas which I believe pltr can aid."

2021-06-29 16:41:39,wallstreetbets,"Instead of SpaceX you can consider Virgin Orbit ($NGCA). It's pre-DA so it hasn't skyrocketed yet.

The problem with SpaceX+Starlink is that you're betting on StarLink's success as much as SpaceX's, whereas with Virgin Orbit you're betting on space in general."
2021-06-29 15:21:13,wallstreetbets,"Starlink maybe. SpaceX never. 

I would love to be wrong on this one because I desperately want to own a piece of SpaceX."
2021-06-29 15:23:18,wallstreetbets,just because musk is the ceo i have a feeling SPX would fucking skyrocket right at IPO
2021-06-29 15:47:53,wallstreetbets,"I’m pretty sure Alphabet still owns about 8% or so of SpaceX, so GOOGL shares get you a piece of SpaceX."
2021-06-29 16:23:05,wallstreetbets,Why you say never? Everything I’ve seen points to him wanting to for the money. SpaceX is about 5 years away from IPO.
2021-06-29 16:34:20,wallstreetbets,"It was from an interview a couple years ago where higher ups in SpaceX were asked about the possibility of a SpaceX IPO and they doubted SpaceX would ever go public but they could see the likelihood of Starlink breaking off.
(I will continue to look for the article but it may take a little while to find it and but if I can dig it up I will post it)."
2021-06-29 16:41:58,wallstreetbets,He has enough “private” accredited investors still interested in funding spacex as a private company that going public is not needed yet and he doesn’t wanna have to deal with the bullshit quarterly short term Wall Street view. The only reason he took tesla public was because he needed to unlock the new investor base and it’s the same deal with star link they need a shit ton of money to scale it out that’s the only reason for an IPO SpaceX will get there much later I said five years but I think it’s realistically 5 to 10. I’m pretty sure SpaceX is the most popular private company in the world that the public wants to invest in and the SpaceX know it for sure. I too can’t wait to get in if I ever get the chance lol

2021-06-29 15:04:26,wallstreetbets,Lmao why SoFi ? I'm really curious. What's the news? Any DD lol
2021-06-29 16:13:57,wallstreetbets,"> Even if interest rates rise in 2 years that actually helps them.

Can you elaborate?"

2021-06-29 15:28:45,wallstreetbets,The share is keep dropping. I am fucked
2021-06-29 16:19:02,wallstreetbets,A solid play.  Sofi is going to be well valued.  Lots will regret not getting in under $20... let alone $30.
2021-06-29 15:50:39,wallstreetbets,"So many salty comments on SoFi gaining popularity, weird.

This company is the absolute definition of a unicorn. Idk if this is a meme stock or not, but you’ll be a multimillionaire within 2-3 years with this position. Congrats and fuck you."

2021-06-29 17:26:52,wallstreetbets,Good luck to all...my first true YOLO after watching all my ape brothers killing it in the meme stocks.
2021-06-29 17:13:50,wallstreetbets,Famous last words.
2021-06-29 19:11:35,wallstreetbets,Got proof it’s 100% SI?
2021-06-29 17:50:42,wallstreetbets,"Its probably one of the safest play we can make at the moment. Thats why big money are willing to go all in.

Upside : Could go $30+ this year or the next
Downside : Strong support at $15….very unlikely to go lower unless a black swan occur for the stock

2021-06-29 15:13:30,wallstreetbets,I’m curious too - why everyone buying Sofi now?
2021-06-29 17:15:17,wallstreetbets,"""Yes, I'm curious too. I don't know how to search Reddit or even do a Google search, or look at any aspects of the stock that help me make a decision on what a good investment is and isn't. Can someone please teach me all of it in this one sub?"" 

Geez. I'm still a noob and I know better than that."

2021-06-29 14:56:54,wallstreetbets,Where’s ur proof ur only under sofi posts ?
2021-06-29 16:00:39,wallstreetbets,Then don’t jump in on every suggestive post. Remember to do your own research too.
2021-06-29 16:26:02,wallstreetbets,Right?! I’m not understanding the salty vibes here.  Pretty straightforward play.  Even if you’re afraid of inflation... you have a bank play right here geared towards millennials and younger generations.
2021-06-29 18:47:03,wallstreetbets,All the salt coming from the apes. There ain’t no GME or AMC in SOFI.
2021-06-29 17:17:27,wallstreetbets,Proof?

2021-06-29 19:17:28,wallstreetbets,"According to TD earlier today it was 148% ... now TD says 4.6% .. I have a screenshot of both. Guess it was a glitch which is upsetting. Still going to hold though

Edit: if I knew how to post screenshots on phone I would. Either way, my OP is no longer valid"
2021-06-29 18:15:32,wallstreetbets,heard it here first
2021-06-29 15:37:41,wallstreetbets,"Here is why I am in sofi long term. Side note I have never owned a meme stock. 

1. Jamie (jmp) recently came out and spoke about how he thinks companies like sofi are a serious threat especially in the near-ish future and regrets not taking the threat seriously. Wouldn’t be shocked if JMP got aggressive in buying up one one of these see their purchase today. 

2. They don’t just have a well known backer and spac leader they have well known and proven CEO who manages the day to day. 

3. Most of what they offer has exploded in the past 24 months look at Morgan Stanley’s increase in trading revenue. 

4. Even if interest rates rise in 2 years that actually helps them. 

5. I will admit I think their current market cap is too high but I’m always too cautious when it comes to that there are other companies within insane market caps with less or no future."
2021-06-29 15:34:26,wallstreetbets,"Yes, market manipulation."
2021-06-29 18:11:51,wallstreetbets,Thought you did something 😭😭😭 nerd
2021-06-29 18:45:55,wallstreetbets,I did my research. There was like 10 posts on wsb?? It wouldn’t go down if this many people are talking about it.
2021-06-29 17:19:04,wallstreetbets,"This is an incredibly solid play. Just a little ridiculous people can't look at the stock and make their own decisions and verify the information in the sub. Yes, good play. Are you supposed to know what your doing? Yeah, lol."
2021-06-29 18:12:54,wallstreetbets,You had me at tits
2021-06-29 16:21:01,wallstreetbets,"Don’t forget!! They have an active CIC bank application that will more than likely be approved this year!  That alone will be a huge driver going forward.  Cheap deposits, FDIC insurance, Fed access."
2021-06-29 15:37:54,wallstreetbets,I saw something I didn't like in here but the user is approved so I ignored it. /u/zjz
2021-06-29 15:41:57,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the info - I’ll keep an eye on it.
2021-06-29 15:37:47,wallstreetbets,I’m still curious - suddenly so many big players are in. I’ve added it in my watch list to see how it goes.
2021-06-29 16:22:14,wallstreetbets,Keep an eye on it? Omg Lol
2021-06-29 15:45:16,wallstreetbets,"From what you think, the big players are in. 

All I see is screenshots, lies, and manipulation."
2021-06-29 17:16:26,wallstreetbets,I know. Right?
2021-06-29 16:32:51,wallstreetbets,"Lol, the hype is definitely real.  We’re not all bots or on the HF payroll."
2021-06-29 16:23:10,wallstreetbets,Active applications are facts bud.  Go take a look at the San Fran Fed site.

2021-06-29 14:42:00,wallstreetbets,Guess BR buying up thousands of houses is working for them.
2021-06-29 14:43:19,wallstreetbets,Sadly everyone needs a house. Population is at all time highs and someday we won't all fit by the Wendy's dumpster.
2021-06-29 14:35:37,wallstreetbets,Either the housing market is going to crash or we are returning to feudalism. Not sure which.
2021-06-29 18:20:18,wallstreetbets,KB Homes ($KBH) is looking like an opportunity. Profiting of the housing boom and dirt cheap with a P/E of 9.127
2021-06-29 14:58:09,wallstreetbets,"FIs have been out-bidding would-be home-owners on houses for sale, in some cases going above 20-50% asking price n paying for them in cash. Once acquired they take that same house and only make it available for rent. In some areas they're even buying entire subdivisions. My theory is that this is how they plan to stay afloat once the inevitable market crash happens. They're forcing would-be home-owners to rent forever, which is an endless supply of income for them. All of this is leading to a scarcity of single-family homes, which has been driving up costs in the housing market steadily for years and will continue to do so unless they're stopped through regulatory intervention. Yeah there will be a big transfer of tendies from the FIs to retail, but that same money will be going back to them through rent. The question is, how do we squeeze them out of property ownership?

EDIT: added the word ""above"" between 'going' and '20-50%' for clarification."
2021-06-29 14:43:26,wallstreetbets,"YoY metrics are useless.

Something pretty significant impacted the economy drastically in Q2 2020. Of course there's going to be crazy steep increases/decreases on virtually every YoY metric."
2021-06-29 14:57:38,wallstreetbets,Crazy to be short real estate right now
2021-06-29 16:46:17,wallstreetbets,I guess we have to move down in the sewers like Demolition Man.
2021-06-29 14:36:40,wallstreetbets,"At this point, I'm just rooting for total economic collapse"
2021-06-29 16:16:10,wallstreetbets,This crash is going to be epic!
2021-06-29 15:06:59,wallstreetbets,"“According to a Wall Street Journal report, BlackRock – led by billionaire Laurence Fink – is purchasing entire neighborhoods and converting single-family homes into rentals; while in cities like Houston, investors like Fink account for one-quarter of the home purchasers.”

Look it up. It’s Legit"
2021-06-29 16:11:29,wallstreetbets,"Love this conversation, have a few rentals and have been pondering when the music is going to stop.

We dont have a precursor to something like 2008, ask any one who is trying to get a mortgage.
Under reported inflation due to the money the feds dumping in, massive funds buying single family homes going out of styel.

I think were headed towards a rental economy."
2021-06-29 14:37:57,wallstreetbets,Give it 2-3 years and it will collapse just like 2008

2021-06-29 19:12:25,wallstreetbets,"That's fair, but eventually the cost of purchase will exceed the cost of new construction.  Lumber and labor at at a premium right now, but once supply chains recover, it becomes more reasonable to buy a plot of land and get a prefab home or build from scratch.  I think that point, combined with the exodus to remote working from LCOL areas will eventually cool things down.

Butttttttttttt that equilibrium price is probably a bit higher than the average home price right now.  So everything sucks, but eventually we get to pick our favorite flavor of suck."
2021-06-29 17:52:15,wallstreetbets,"This is Fud... based on that bullshit ""BlackRock is buying neighborhoods"" article that's been floating around. The one where NOT BlackRock bought a rental development... that was built to be a rental property and was fully rented... for cash flow.

FI own less than 1% of SFR housing in any state and much less than that in all but a couple. They are not a material factor in any SFR market."
2021-06-29 15:15:20,wallstreetbets,"This statement is true, but if we're staying focused on the housing market, home prices have been skyrocketing for long before Covid.

There is zero actual evidence that institutional buyers are getting into SFR individual sales and they'd be pants on head retarded to take on those kinds of investments. You can't just shotgun purchase homes and expect to make consistent returns buying well over list."
2021-06-29 14:39:12,wallstreetbets,2008 collapse was due to subprime loan. I just bought a house and scrutiny is high this time and not everyone can get loans

2021-06-29 15:28:39,wallstreetbets,"Doubtful. 2008 was caused by the banks giving out NINJA loans and the bum loaners didn't know how adjustable mortgage rates worked so a lot of people ended up defaulting which caused all MBS to become virtually worthless. I am currently under contract to buy a house in CA and the lenders are checking all my assets (paystubs, brokerage/bank accounts, debts, paystubs, retirement savings, etc.) to ensure that their loan is not ""risky"""

2021-06-29 15:29:19,wallstreetbets,I paid 60K more and it's below appraisal by a lot but whatever. I need move to somewhere else for the summer and it's more than easy to find a renter and was able to use the rent to cover my mortgage.

2021-06-29 19:19:43,wallstreetbets,"I'm aware it's not a direct source, but search ""[financial institutions buying houses](https://www.google.com/search?q=financial+institutions+buying+houses)"" on the Big G and you'll find many examples. Then look up REITs and the firms that have REIT ETFs. Look at those ETFs and see which real estate firms and REITs they're working with, and how much they have invested in each. WS funds have an ever-increasing position in real estate, allegedly bc it's a ""safe place to park the money."" Without certainty, my bet is that they're transferring a significant amount of their earnings into housing so they can file losses once their short positions erupt and it's time to pay up. They'll be able to get a tax break while still holding assets that will provide an assured (perhaps slow) return, while saving them from bankruptcy long-term. Sorry this isn't all compacted into a direct source, but the info provided developed the roots of my inquiries and learning. Willing to admit that ""I might be wrong,"" but I do my best to keep up with recent news and adjust my views accordingly."
2021-06-29 19:55:42,wallstreetbets,"I've read multiple articles pertaining to that, and ""No,"" they're not the basis of this sentiment. If I recall correctly, the first article initiating that conversation came out 3-ish years ago. Blackrock IS buying a lot of houses, but isn't a standalone entity solely contributing to the analysis. Not by any means. MANY, MANY, MANY are, via personal acquisition of properties and through holding large stakes in property/real estate companies. Creating their own ETFs that solely fixate on the housing market, which they're able to raise the rates of by purchasing properties managed by the companies they're invested in. Home prices go up because they buy the homes, rental prices go up because they rent them out at rates exceeding what would be the 'mortgage payment.' They don't have a mortgage payment, because they buy them 100% cash-up-front. All they pay is property tax while waiting for their profits to eventually return multiples on the dollar. It's a smart play. There are already over 4,000,000 more wannabe home-buyers than there are homes available. Unless the people who want to buy a home decide to ""stick it to the man"" and live in a tiny-home or converted vehicle, they'll have to pay a higher rate than they'd pay on mortgage in order to rent, the same exact home they could've owned, from ""the man."""
2021-06-29 15:29:12,wallstreetbets,"So something I struggle with and please don’t take this as anything personal, just trying to see others feedback. It is great to have an asset that doubled in value and assuming you don’t have a mortgage it is all yours. 

The issue I can’t reconcile is that any realized profit from that asset means selling your house and is again massively impacted by the cost to find another house.  The only way to cash in on your home is to sell, wait for a huge market dip and hope to capitalize in a down market. 

Sorry if this is a bit rambly. My family keeps pressuring us to buy a house because it is a good financial investment and I keep countering with that argument. I feel like buying a house has to be done personal happiness and not an asset to bank on in the future."

Sure people can afford these 20% increases in home values when 30 year fixed rate loans are 2.75%… no one will be able to afford these prices when the rates return to an avg of 4.25% (which historically speaking is still low AF)

If you know you are going to be in this home for 7-10 years then buying a home right now is a solid move. Anything less is putting yourself at serious risk."
2021-06-29 15:17:56,wallstreetbets,The collapse this time wouldn’t come from rates increasing and then people becoming delinquent.  It would come from people losing jobs once vivid supports are gone and not being able to pay.  Even if they were approved with tough standards those all assumed they had employment.
2021-06-29 14:40:54,wallstreetbets,So what happens to the house you bought for 500k now that was 280k 1.5 years ago? What happens when you resell it and you are negative equity?
2021-06-29 15:31:59,wallstreetbets,"Have fun reselling that house when you are paying probably 30% over what it’s actual worth is. Just because this is a different animals it’s the same beast. There will be a housing crisis again. Just because lenders are doing their job for once doesn’t mean the prices, inflation, etc won’t cause an issue. Bet you didn’t know the rising rate of those applying for loans are being turned down because the appraisal price isn’t meeting the asking price which leave the buyer having to cover. Which they can’t. There will be a problem and the housing crisis wasn’t solely because of NINJA loans. It was primarily caused by ACORN."
2021-06-29 15:07:11,wallstreetbets,"I'm also renting out my first home. The housing market will dip eventually and home values will decrease. However, rent prices are not based on the cost of homes, rather, on the availability of rental units. The only way rental prices will significantly dip is if more inventory comes on the market, which will take several years at least."
2021-06-29 16:22:05,wallstreetbets,"Inflation is happening now so doubtful, if the prices go down to the previous years, assuming you aren't just house hopping, the prices will eventually go catch up and exceed your initial prices, decades of regular inflation will make sure of that"
2021-06-29 15:25:14,wallstreetbets,"The cool thing about the housing market is it's a wash, unless you're selling to go live in a van down by the river. Sell 1 home buy another home. Unless you're switching to renting it should Wash out in the end.

It's more complicated than that, but"
2021-06-29 17:28:20,wallstreetbets,"Look at the death rates each year, 2020 was no different. Covid had zero affect"
2021-06-29 14:45:31,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is America"
2021-06-29 14:59:42,wallstreetbets,"You're going to get shot trying that, just fyi"
2021-06-29 19:25:24,wallstreetbets,"My guess is that, once the market crashes, real estate rates will be the same or continue increasing, due to a 'checkmate' in supply and demand, unless a significant amount of people opt to live in 'tiny homes', converted vehicles, etc, which isn't feasible for the average US citizen. Unless demand decreases due to such moves, I don't personally think the housing market will be more than temporarily affected by any market crash on WS."
2021-06-29 15:36:13,wallstreetbets,"You hit the nail right on the head.

The booming price is only beneficial if I purchased the house with the intent to sell later on to realize those profits, with a new place to live in (a second home?) already lined up in advance.

I don't know why I come across as happy that my home has doubled in value, because that doesn't help me in any way...as a matter of fact, it HURTS me because now I'm paying way higher property taxes against it.

And to your point, if I want to sell and realize the gains, I would immediately lose them when I have to pay an equally inflated price for whatever new home I then need to find.

The house is a 2 unit and the long term goal was/is still to hang onto it and rent out both units eventually. Currently we live upstairs and rent out downstairs on Airbnb.

We're in the market for one more income property, and after that plan to buy ourselves a normal single-family home...which we want in the worst way, but know that getting one more double would really set us up nicely for the long term. We have two currently...the one we live in, and a separate one.

The nice thing about being a landlord vs flipping for quick bigger profits is that our business plan is minimally affected by crazy home price swings. While the costs of homes have doubled here in Buffalo, NY for the last several years, rent has remained much more steady...so hopefully being in this for the long haul of residual income is a good way for us to hedge against a potential housing market crash."
2021-06-29 16:19:11,wallstreetbets,"Just look at the alternative, renting. Rent will continue to go up most years. Eventually you'll have the house paid off and no payments at all (and a nice mortgage interest deduction on your taxes every year). Even if you don't realize the capital gains on the appreciating asset, it's still a good long-term investment."
2021-06-29 16:33:58,wallstreetbets,"Borrowing money to buy assets in a debt based system is what the wealthy do. Period. If youre not borrowing money you are getting destroyed by inflation. Borrowing money is a hedge against inflation. If inflation happens, you are making money from your loans. If it doesnt happen, worst case scenario is you owe the same value as you borrowed. How much of a risk is there of US dollars going up in purchasing power over the course of 20 years. Theres literally bo risk, which is why all the wealthy people you know are levered up to the hilt."
2021-06-29 17:02:14,wallstreetbets,You can do what’s called a cash out refinance to take some gainz. Eg- you bought a house for $300k. You owe $250k on it. It’s worth $500k now so bank will lend you $450k. You have an extra $200k to YOLo.
2021-06-29 15:33:05,wallstreetbets,"exactly, people need a house. If they sell their house, they either want to upgrade, downgrade to a smaller house, or move away. I only see rising in real estate price benefit you if you downgrade to a smaller house or move to a cheaper area."
2021-06-29 17:11:53,wallstreetbets,You are correct. Also could sell in a very in demand market like CA and then move to somewhere like OK where you can could cover most of the hone cost with profits from the previous sale. Given you are living within your means.
2021-06-29 19:25:53,wallstreetbets,The only pro to this IMO is you’re basically making payments into something that you could sell instead of paying someone else’s mortgage
2021-06-29 18:25:44,wallstreetbets,"You also need to consider the fact that any mortgage is going to have you paying the lowest proportion of principal vs interest (bout 20%/80%) for the first 7'ish years and decline on a curve over time more towards your favor. Fun fact, last I checked the average buyer owns for 7 years on average before buying something else.

Not saying don't buy but def worth considering the possibility the well meaning ppl giving you the advice didn't know they were playing with the deck stacked against them."
2021-06-29 16:29:01,wallstreetbets,The metrics are way different.
2021-06-29 16:20:51,wallstreetbets,Most of us don’t enjoying living in cornfields…..Midwest living my ass.  There is a reason it’s called fly over country.
2021-06-29 15:31:02,wallstreetbets,downvoted for saying coastal garbage - we have very nice places okay?
2021-06-29 18:09:11,wallstreetbets,My great grandfather bought his single family home on a single income and the interest rate was 16%.
2021-06-29 14:50:00,wallstreetbets,Definitely don’t plan to sell for 7 - 10 years when the rent can pay my mortgage.
2021-06-29 14:43:26,wallstreetbets,"Don’t plan to move for at least 5 years. And if i move away, I will just turn that into a rental. Currently, the rental price can cover the mortgage and I expect the rent to go up in my area."
2021-06-29 17:20:11,wallstreetbets,"The house I'm getting is up in the hills and I'm 30k under asking price so I'm not too worried about the appraisal contingency. And I don't have plans to sell it anytime soon, maybe rent out the bottom floor. The location here commands really competitive rent prices based on what I can see on craigslist and Trulia so I'm not worried about the monthly mortgage payments either. Housing prices have been on a bull run for the past decade and houses here in California are selling like hotcakes. Everyone is always screaming about an incoming bubble or crash but I don't think that's likely in the foreseeable future but, hey, those people might eventually be right in another decade."
2021-06-29 17:30:17,wallstreetbets,what country are you in?

2021-06-29 15:50:57,wallstreetbets,"We have a small (very very small) vacation house. Prices in the area are completely detached from reality. It’s to the point we’d be crazy not to sell the place. We didn’t buy it to make money, just for a familiar spot to spend away. But man. It’s bananas. Talking almost double from spring 2020 (prior to that it was a pretty sleepy market with single-digit annual% increases)."
2021-06-29 18:38:24,wallstreetbets,Damn I’m in ca and only pay tax on the house each year based off the original sale price.
2021-06-29 17:23:53,wallstreetbets,"I mean if you sold and rented like they are advocating is better than buying you are coming out ahead.

You don't have to buy another house. You bought a house because you enjoy owning a house. That's what it should be."
2021-06-29 16:21:43,wallstreetbets,You can also take out loans against your equity to either invest more in the house or buy another to rent out to someone  else or anything else you need capital for.
2021-06-29 17:04:47,wallstreetbets,You don’t get the deduction anymore if you’ve paid it off. Depending on your tax situation it is more beneficial to refinance.
2021-06-29 16:45:15,wallstreetbets,“This time it’s different….”
2021-06-29 17:07:02,wallstreetbets,"Same people taking out the same insane amount of loans they can never pay off. Once variable interest rates skyrocket and everyone gets buried because they are house poor, they will be forced to sell and the market will crash again."
2021-06-29 15:32:30,wallstreetbets,"Million dollar homes literally falling apart in California. 

I love the cities, but I couldn’t even afford to live there."
2021-06-29 15:13:58,wallstreetbets,Not every has that option or thought process.
2021-06-29 18:18:25,wallstreetbets,"I think we'll see a pull-back when interest rates finally go up, which will help pump the brakes on the market a bit, but I don't think we'll see anything like 2008 at this time either.  It's hard for the market not to charge with 2% interest rates, but I'll be glad to see labor and building material costs correct a little bit."
2021-06-29 17:31:09,wallstreetbets,US
2021-06-29 15:50:04,wallstreetbets,If you're having trouble paying the rent I kinda doubt you own a firearm.  Even if you do: you act like you're going to do anything but get shot trying to be a thief ffs
2021-06-29 17:45:24,wallstreetbets,There is a beach I used to go to that is average. Nothing crazy 5-6 years ago you could get a nice condo for 300-500k. With 3br. Now they are all 1.2-1.4m. This is for a condo that is probably 15 years old at least in Florida.
2021-06-29 18:48:14,wallstreetbets,"NY...fml

Edit: to add/explain, they assess the value of your home against recent home sales in your area of comparable houses. It's somewhat subjective in that they're assuming my house would go for as much as, say, as the home that just sold after having a six figure gut job/full reno. So, you're assuming I've also done that much work to my house to justify saying I would theoretically get as much for my house as the other house got...and then make me pay taxes based on that theoretical subjective imaginary ""would be"" price for my house. Fuck the government man."
2021-06-29 18:33:39,wallstreetbets,"Yes I should have been more clear. You get the deduction while paying it off. Can offset property taxes, so it's a wash in high tax states."
2021-06-29 17:10:15,wallstreetbets,"Except people aren’t taking out variable rate loans.

Banks aren’t lying about income figures.

This is more about: supply/demand economics, lumber/construction prices, etc. 

If anybody has a variable interest loan they’re a moron who deserves to be foreclosed on."
2021-06-29 15:35:54,wallstreetbets,location location location - they are expensive because most people want to live there. Also because those places have better paying jobs. Hope you can live wherever you want in the future!
2021-06-29 18:20:53,wallstreetbets,"Yeah man, I was thinking about building a new fence around the backyard but then I saw the wood prices 😳

2021-06-29 14:15:08,wallstreetbets,"You sold a put credit spread and bought an option...

If Ford is at $14 at expiration, you lose $150:

$(150) loss on the 15.5 strike plus the $71 of credit you get from selling it.

$(8) loss from your 13.5 put being worthless

$(63) loss from your call being worthless.

As a matter of facts, you are losing money on it right now if you executed this trade because Ford is already below $15.5 strike.

Short of Ford stock going up, you lose money. Just go buy a call and you can get the same thing with way less risk."

2021-06-29 19:41:02,wallstreetbets,I like your idea... I don't have any options but am holding Ford long.  They will do really well in the EV market in the near future and the stock will worth a lot more when people realize that it will take shares from Tesla.
2021-06-29 17:50:17,wallstreetbets,"Correct.  Buying puts are good if you are planning on holding the shares.

In fact you may want to hold shares because 100 shares of Ford also gives you access to Ford discounts."

2021-06-29 15:13:51,wallstreetbets,You're welcome. It's very helpful.
2021-06-29 15:15:25,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's the problem with synthetic positions in my experience. You inevitably end up risking more in terms of collateral than you would have spent had you just bought the position outright. Occasionally you can get an ""edge"" via pricing inefficiencies, but let's be real, OP didn't do that 😂"
2021-06-29 15:24:54,wallstreetbets,"This is true. I didn’t do that. 😛

I’m going to be riding this out regardless because I’m bullish on F the rest of this week and next and the max potential downside is like. <0.15% of my portfolio. So sure I guess.

Could you elaborate on the getting an edge in pricing though?

I only did this trade to learn more. Starting to dip my toe in the options game before I get into it.

So far; ye I figure buying a straight call would’ve significantly limited downside but also cost more upfront. Which. I have the cap for rn so I guess I could have done.

But honestly.

If this is profitable I would have the satisfaction of saying I did a 100x trade this year and being technically true 🌚."
2021-06-29 17:24:31,wallstreetbets,"Lol, yeah, if this hits the percentage gains are going to be astronomical. That's definitely the fun part of these kinds of positions.

The reason you're taking more risk on board is because of the collateral on the bull put spread. The long call has a max loss of $81, but you paid for it by opening a credit spread with a max loss of $200.

The ""arbitrage"" aspect of it comes when you compare the cost of a traditional synthetic share position with a traditional long stock position. There can be cases where you collect more premium from the short put than you spend on the long call - giving you an edge relative to just buying shares with the collateral. Don't count on *always* being able to do that, but that's why some people trade them."

2021-06-29 16:57:14,wallstreetbets,"NKE sales = $44 billion
UAA sales = $4.8 billion 

I like UAA and have owned it for a while. I do think they will capture some market share, but they are currently valued 100x P/E whereas NKE even after is pop is trading at 42 P/E. If anything UAA is way overvalued at the moment and will need to show SUBSTANTIALLY better earnings to warrant even a small rise in stock price let alone a 60% rise in 4 months. Also, and this only matters since we’re on WSB, but the short interest is less than 4%."

2021-06-29 14:00:20,wallstreetbets,I follow this guy on twitter.he made lot of good calls in past two months...he nails TA.
2021-06-29 15:21:22,wallstreetbets,hyln is one of the most disappointing stocks ive ever owned. Glad I sold it. Dont get me wrong I still made some money off it but HYLN imo didn't react to market momentum ...
2021-06-29 16:42:57,wallstreetbets,This looks like it’s continuing downward
2021-06-29 14:20:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, his post history is on point. /s"
2021-06-29 14:09:18,wallstreetbets,Agreed !
2021-06-29 15:05:45,wallstreetbets,"For real, this guy prints money"
2021-06-29 18:37:41,wallstreetbets,"I also owned, didn’t give me enough adrenaline each time I looked at my broker. The tech looks good though.

I guess PAYTIENCE is a virtue but not on this sub when you see people get rich literally overnight."
2021-06-29 15:30:21,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the insight! When you say market momentum, do you also include how the stock reacted to news from the company? or just how it reacted to the more general market as a whole?"
2021-06-29 18:42:32,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it’s still a good stock. I think the company will do good as well but long term. 

And it’s not even about patience .. when the entire sector is up and you continue to stay down for the next 2-3 pumps … might as well invest in literally any other stock within that sector and you’re guaranteed returns. But I guess that does have a lot to do with patience 😂"
2021-06-29 16:29:56,wallstreetbets,"Both. Whenever there was a catalyst for the company; leading up to the catalyst there was barely any momentum and when the catalysts dropped - the stock dropped or remained stagnant. 

Also last year, around March, when EV & SPACS were blowing up, HYLN did move and I made some money off it but ever since then, any momentum within the EV and other related markets has been generally dismissed by the stock. 

Sure there are some upward movements but I personally think my money is better invested in other opportunities with faster and more predictable returns. 

I guess you could say that hedge funds & shorts are what’s causing the stock to act this way but imo it simply doesn’t have the momentum of retail investors behind it."
2021-06-29 19:53:37,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, it's not dogshit but will probably give you boomer-level returns. There are better 'speculative' plays on the market and I guess SPACs get a bad rep. But who the fuck knows, I eat crayons."

I’m no financial advisor but I pay a lot of attention to this industry, and I assure you this industry is going to fall apart eventually and need to be rebuilt. Labs are getting faked all the time to show higher THC %, companies are selling their products at absurd markups, it’s still the Wild West. You can make THC for pennies a gram and companies are selling it for 25-100$ a gram depending on the state. The plant grows so readily it’s coloquial name is *WEED* for Christ’s sake. The only thing that makes it a commodity is the fact that it’s illegal."

Might be a 500% or more on stock alone, which makes it absolutely insane moneymaker for lucky option players.

2021-06-29 13:05:01,wallstreetbets,Norwegian Air Is a much better investment right now🚀
2021-06-29 13:18:23,wallstreetbets,"It fell because most of their fleet is old and shitty and needs replacing, it's barely an expansion.

How do you think they'll pay for the planes, just with pocket change? No, they're either paying with loans/bonds or issuing new shares, and if for some reason they're unable to stick to the contracts they are gonna get fucked by suppliers/debt holders, all of which is bad for investors.

It will go up pretty nice, if you hold it for a year or two. I expect it to trade sideways for a month or two, so I'll probably look into a butterfly spread tonight."
2021-06-29 13:34:36,wallstreetbets,I got 24 shares at $39.
2021-06-29 13:45:39,wallstreetbets,"The stock isn't blowing up on this order because it's not expansion. It's replacement. United's fleet age is 16.4 years - and closer to 20 years if you count only the ancient narrowbodies that these A321 and 737 orders will replace. The bulk of this order will replace: 40 757-200s (avg. age 25 years), 96 A320s (avg. age 23 years), and possibly some of their hundreds of 737 NGs that average 18 years of fleet age."
2021-06-29 13:56:22,wallstreetbets,"IMO, better investment is in Boeing ($BA) and Spirit Aerosystems ($SPR).

2021-06-29 13:34:17,wallstreetbets,"From [investopedia.com](https://investopedia.com): What Is a Put? A put is an options contract that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell a certain amount of the underlying asset, at a set price within a specific time. The buyer of a put option believes that the underlying stock will drop below the exercise price before the expiration date.

&#x200B;

Now is the part where I am going to give my completely uninformed theory as to what could possibly happen; I am a complete non-professional and don't know what I'm talking about.

WKHS is currently selling higher than the put contract gives them the right to sell for, so there is no point in using the put contract to sell right now. But, let's say they all sell their WKHS shares which drives the price below the put contract price. Now, they can suddenly buy more WKHS shares and sell it for a higher price using the put contract. Again, I don't know what I'm talking about. Someone else should probably give a more legit answer."
2021-06-29 14:00:41,wallstreetbets,"It means that they're on the wrong side of this bet.

To be fair.. I probably should deeper look at the history of WKHS vehicles to compare."

2021-06-29 18:13:38,wallstreetbets,Idk but whoever did is feeling good right now
2021-06-29 16:41:06,wallstreetbets,"By design the Lordstown Endurance and the WKHS NGDV are built on the same skateboard. 

Since Oshkosh did their own testing on a vehicle not yet built, WKHS has a good chance. 

From a business standpoint, outside of the USPS, they’re projecting a near break even this year

Here’s some info on the company. But definitely check out their webpage.

I'm all for calling the test driver a flailing spastic, but I would note that some auto boxes I've driven still lock with a solenoid when the key is pulled in drive - so even if the handbrake is off, it stays put"

They are OK, for a home user if they are still doing the ""buy this knife and we sharpen it for you forever"" I can see the value there, just avoid the whole sets and get a chef knife and a paring knife, maybe a bread knife if you need one of those and ship them back to get sharpened once a year.  Outside of that if you are in to cooking or want to learn to maintain your own there are better options.

The scissors though, those fuckers can still cut a penny in half a decade later, I stan those scissors."

2021-06-29 15:41:28,wallstreetbets,"The fact that there is a poverty line in the United States is pretty ridiculous. Then consider how many Americans fall under that line and it is literally perplexing. When you hear things like a child tax credit of $300 PER MONTH, per child will cut child poverty in half. $300 a month to raise an American child above the poverty line. That’s insane.
It makes you wonder why the richest country in the world even has children that live under a poverty line. 

Keep in mind we spend between $100-$150 a DAY for every person we incarcerate. Majority of which are for non-violent drug crimes. (Hopefully people will realize that keeping more children from being raised in poverty, would keep more children from growing up and rapidly joining that prison population..just sayin) 

Yes - life is harder and poverty lines don’t compare with those of 3rd world nations - the difference is, we have the ability to fix ours. And could do so with such (relative) speed and ease it should make you question why the fuck our country hasn’t done it already..."

For us, my old man worked nuclear power until he hit max rad, and then he tried to fall back on his electric and plumbing background, which when he got started paid good, but the democrats and Clinton specifically had thrown the doors open to massive illegal immigration.


Long story short, they can work for sub minimum wage and pay no taxes, so they multiple times put him out of a job, and he and my uncle lost a lot of contracts to cheap foreign and illegal labor.

2021-06-29 18:25:57,wallstreetbets,"Japanese and German knives are typically at top of pack. Outside of that it depends on your budget. Messermeister, Henckels (NOT international version), Shun all make good knives that go for $100+ or so a piece.

Then you have the bespoke pieces that require a lot of care and maintenance that go for 4 figures a piece."
2021-06-29 19:07:03,wallstreetbets,"Loaded question, depends on what your using the knife for.  A lot goes in to them.  Personally, for me, the 2 knives I use most are a knockoff Chinese VG10 8"" chefs knife and a Wusthof 10"" chef.  The VG10 could be a nameless flat slab of metal without a handle for all I care as long as the metal is real VG10, I use it for any boneless proteins and veg due to the hardness of the metal and its edge retention, everything else I use the ""softer"" Wusthof so I don't need to worry about it chipping on a bone.

People ask me to recommend knives a lot and it depends what they are for, you want a 1 and done set that looks nice, Shun IMO, your gonna spend but you wont be disappointed.  You a hobby or pro cook? Put it together piece by piece, every maker has different qualities.  Hell even Dexter, long considered the cheap junk knives a job provides for you, their scimitars and santokus are legit high quality, they just ALSO make shitty chef knives.  To put it another way it would be like finding out Walmarts Great Value tires are actually one of the bets sets of tires you can get, but only the performance summer ones.

TLDR: depends on what I'm cutting, but look at the type of metal and hardness > name brand, even the handle doesn't matter, I use a pinch grip 90% of the time as long as it's balanced."

Pretty good for trailer trash, na?  Nowhere else in the world can you do that without connections.

People like you, complain and never take action. You never take the steps. The world happens around you, and to you, and you take the least common denominator of actions. Doing nothing but existing as a passive participant.

2021-06-29 14:06:50,wallstreetbets,Why is this better than $HCIC which is going public via spac with better revenue projections and a quarter of the market cap?

2021-06-29 15:21:49,wallstreetbets,I guess the 1k Amazon order and possible 20% stake in the company means Amazon hasn't done their Due Dillegence? Lol. Amazon's already looked at the market and has decided Plus is the way to go.

Their current evaluation makes 0 sense - they had it rough before covid, closed down everything and took out huge loans and their share price has been steadily increasing to ATH. I've been wanting to short this trash company for a while now. Finances are dogshit."
2021-06-29 12:28:13,wallstreetbets,I’ve paid more than $90 to fuck a dolphin.

2021-06-29 18:53:02,wallstreetbets,"There's a reason that all but one of their new coasters for 2020 haven't opened yet, despite construction and testing being completed on all of them. They paused payments to all ride manufacturers in March last year, so I think that those companies have paused their openings until the final payments go through. Which means Sea World owes a lot of money to a bunch of different companies and they can't pay it."

2021-06-29 12:49:48,wallstreetbets,"Up 238% in the last year is fucking insane.

You'd think that in 2021 people would decide that an orca slave labour camp masquerading as entertainment was wrong but yet again the human race goes above and beyond.

[This article](https://8forty.ca/2020/06/10/even-years-after-blackfish-seaworld-still-has-orcas/) has, hands down one of the most hilariously contradictory statements in it:

>In 2016, the theme park stopped all captivity breeding and decided to temporarily stop all shows. These shows will simply be educational sessions about the orcas, instead of the tricks and dances they were forced to do beforehand. SeaWorld claims their intention is to help bring awareness to the maltreatment of marine life, and a positive change to future mammals.

Seaworld is basically like: ""Hey come pay to see this 'educational' experience where we show how you shouldn't treat marine life badly. You know, like we've been doing for decades"".

I know SeaLife does some good for marine life with their external programmes and charity stuff, but it's pretty fucking contradictory that they fund those through the pain and suffering of animals."

2021-06-29 15:41:27,wallstreetbets,Jim-Bob in Destin. He’ll cut you a deal after your first dozen or so. Great guy.
2021-06-29 18:30:52,wallstreetbets,Did you pay first?
2021-06-29 19:41:22,wallstreetbets,"The pay isn’t very good, but the tips are big"
2021-06-29 14:07:43,wallstreetbets,So 22-23 puts is what you’re telling me?? God dammit I’m in
2021-06-29 13:38:30,wallstreetbets,"Fair point but that argument is also kindof like saying ""Epstein will save 20 orphans and only keep two for himself so really I am helping the orphans when I pay to watch him get a massage"" haha"
2021-06-29 16:28:09,wallstreetbets,"lol you can spend all day on a boat and maybe see a whale tail from a mile away. Only a small percentage of people will do that. 

All these heros working on shutting down sea world thinking they are doing the whales a favor, are just sealing their fate. Out of sight, out of mind."
2021-06-29 19:56:14,wallstreetbets,OP was applying morals to a stonk which is where PM came from. I was simply saying wall street doesn't care if they gut and kill a whale every night. As long as they can show they have potential to be profitable the stonk will go up. Remember when retards were saying NKLA was going to sub $5? Yea its a shit scam company but wall street doesn't make the moves that seem obvious.
2021-06-29 12:40:16,wallstreetbets,Now that’s a show
2021-06-29 14:09:03,wallstreetbets,Give me your email. I got a great video for you bud. You’re welcome
2021-06-29 12:30:21,wallstreetbets,Ok... not into that but each their own.

2021-06-29 18:16:08,wallstreetbets,Had a whale of a time
2021-06-29 14:48:52,wallstreetbets,Watch “Seaspiracy”.
2021-06-29 15:19:08,wallstreetbets,"I mean it's fucked, but it is how the world works. A lot of conservation work in Africa is funded by hunters. You let some rich doctor from the USA pay $500k to shoot an old giraffe that isn't mating anymore to pay for all the protection from poachers. If you didn't have that money, poachers would kill 10+ animals. So it is in the best interest of the animals to let a few be hunted legally to fund the protection for the rest."
2021-06-29 14:35:36,wallstreetbets,"That’s the problem tho. 

Tbh idk where I fall on this but letting some pervert fuck two of the kids he saved from a burning building vs letting all of those kids die.

This is why I’m maths not philosophy ><"
2021-06-29 14:29:30,wallstreetbets,Everyone loves animals if they can repair their PR a little. Best hope is they die from insurmountable debt and dumbass management.
2021-06-29 19:22:01,wallstreetbets,It's the illegal naked shorting that has people upset.  Regular shorting will always happen.
2021-06-29 13:28:39,wallstreetbets,"If you turn on margin account, then you have access to shorting. Done.

It's no different from regular buy/sell.

&#x200B;

I am not your financial advisor but I will say this. If you don't know much, I would NOT recommend anyone ever to short."
2021-06-29 14:44:28,wallstreetbets,I too am retard. Cash account for stonks and margin for degenerate gambling.

2021-06-29 16:41:21,wallstreetbets,Watch “BLACKFISH”
2021-06-29 15:22:07,wallstreetbets,For sure I agree we let Epstein keep the two orphans but I’m still shorting the stock of the company that charges for watching the massage
2021-06-29 15:04:28,wallstreetbets,But only the ass right?
2021-06-29 16:41:20,wallstreetbets,Is that the only time you’ve had raw beef? The vac-sealed whole beef tenderloins at the grocery store are generally safe to eat raw. Home made carpaccio or tartare is amazing. Not gastronomic advice.
2021-06-29 18:42:41,wallstreetbets,"Not the same because Epstein would get bored of the orphans as they grow older. He needed a constant flow of orphans, it was getting unsustainable."

2021-06-29 13:56:35,wallstreetbets,"I'd expect a retest on the 50 day MA around $10. I'd probably favor making my position after the OPEC+ meeting.

I would add for the Bear Case. Oil producers want to renegotiate their pipeline rates down and I think they will get those rates down and there's little in the way of pipeline growth happening right now and I wouldn't expect it to. That's maybe bearish in the medium to longer term. 

But for the next 2-4 years, this stock could work. I wouldn't expect to see $35 though (the high from before the 2014/2015 market crash)."
2021-06-29 18:58:34,wallstreetbets,Oil and gas is a dying boomer industry. For that reason I am out.

2021-06-29 18:00:37,wallstreetbets,"Look up TR 3B or TR 3 black manta. These “UFOs” or UAPs are actually an extremely advanced military project. It uses the “pais effect” to make the craft levitate. It also utilizes a compact fusion engine and room temperature super conductor. This tech is jaw dropping stuff. If you compare the shape of the craft to the one in the CNN and NY times videos, you’ll see they look the same."
2021-06-29 18:15:13,wallstreetbets,Shares of PTPs are a great way to make your CPA hate you. Bonus points if you do a lot of small partial sales of your interest.

Also, this is a twenty nine billion dollar company, not a dinky ass pump and dump like some of these. I didn't mention some mythical squeeze or any bullshit like. Is it so fucking unbelievable that it might actually be a company I'm invested in and thought was a good play? 

How's that for copywriter."
2021-06-29 17:33:29,wallstreetbets,Instead of a resume builders people using DD builders haha
2021-06-29 14:03:17,wallstreetbets,"1) Not like I chose the ticker name dude. Posts are supposed to, like, get attention? Makes sense to make the title something interesting.

2) I've been in WSB for years homie. I nuked my old account a while back.

3) Maybe it has responses and positive feedback because it's a well written and thought out DD? I didn't collaborate with anyone else on this, and I have no idea who any of the people are who are responding.

4) Know your audience. If you want to appeal to WSB, speak the language. I'm not writing this for suits at Goldman dawg.

Bonus: Good luck trying to PnD this. This is a 29 billion market cap company with a high amount of daily volume. WSB isn't going to be able to move this much, even if everyone was on board. There's no squeeze, no gamma explosion, and literally nothing else in this DD that would suggest that's it's similar to other obvious PnD schemes. If you disagree with my thesis, then be a good boy and write your own explaining how I'm wrong, but going around and accusing people of PnD nonsense, and suggesting that I'm somehow fabricating the attention that this is getting is both insulting to the work I put in, and just plain unsubstantiated idiocy."

On another pipeline company I had to pay state taxes in 5 states I don't live in... Fun things and normal tax software doesn't handle these types of business well.. So you can do tax fraud and wait until the states fine you for the $20 buckets you owe them or pay the accountant the $600 fee....

Mind you they haven't had a profit in years so it hasn't been an issue.. But you still have to file the paper work..."

I even said it may make a good trade for a few years, but I think there's a better entry point and the OPEC meeting is in a few days here."
2021-06-29 19:44:06,wallstreetbets,"I got a reddit direct message trying to push ET a few weeks back.. They even have a subreddit.. Looks like someone is pushing for a pump ans dump and a lot of people are going to be fucked when taxes come when they don't know how to file  joint partnership when the tax information shows up 3 weeks before taxes are do.. 

I have held ET for years and only bought back in when oil went negative. ET and other pipeline companies hardly move from their baseline divided payout.  The time to get in was before the new pipeline shutdown and when oil went negative.. 

KMI is still under valued but likely won't go much above 18 for  while.."

2021-06-29 15:45:44,wallstreetbets,All good I'm glad you brought it up. It's also possible the OPEC meeting is a good catalyst right? Like it could go either way?

2021-06-29 13:09:57,wallstreetbets,Same here with 1100 shares collecting 1k in premium a week currently. Awesome shit
2021-06-29 16:39:26,wallstreetbets,Still an idiot trying to learn. Selling CC is covered calls? If that’s correct why would you want to sell calls if you think it’s going up?
2021-06-29 14:38:28,wallstreetbets,"I mean unless there is any type of short term play here, majority of WSB won't jump in lol. I'm glad I held off. I'm not into long term plays. Social sentiment is dropping fast with this one. The hype is downing down somewhat. It will prob pick up again this week or the next. Maybe even tomorrow. I'm not jumping in until I see the signs of a big run up possibly happening."
2021-06-29 12:20:11,wallstreetbets,What strike / date are you cc'ing?  Far enough out to always keep the stock or is there a percent/week you would sell at?
2021-06-29 17:15:11,wallstreetbets,I’m kind of thinking $69.
2021-06-29 13:11:30,wallstreetbets,This ape is buying the dip! 🚀
2021-06-29 15:17:06,wallstreetbets,You really think Wish is going to $60 a share?

2021-06-29 14:41:05,wallstreetbets,"Things are not looking good for you my friend. You have a couple morons in here gloating about how they are selling options and making tons of money. Plus the social sentiment hype has died down. It may pick up again this week. But as of right now, its barely being mentioned compared to other stocks like workhorse, clov, amc. I hope it does pick up for you. I've been there."
2021-06-29 14:20:52,wallstreetbets,I'm in at 32k!
2021-06-29 17:14:39,wallstreetbets,Yes sir. Get in early and buy the fear like today.
2021-06-29 18:28:56,wallstreetbets,Lol what are you on about? They are undervalued as fuck. If anything this is an amazing company to yolo versus meme stocks that are huge risk/heavily shorted.
2021-06-29 17:06:39,wallstreetbets,"Better yet, average down. I'm levered to the absolute tits on this one."
2021-06-29 14:07:26,wallstreetbets,Which strikes are you selling?
2021-06-29 17:17:14,wallstreetbets,"It also lowers your entry price. You buy 100 shs at 14, sell 1 covered call a week out for a buck, now your cost is 13, etc. Theoretically you could just keep doing this. Wash, rinse, repeat.

However, if the stock has pop and crosses the strike price, well then you lose that upside. Hope that helps."
2021-06-29 17:00:56,wallstreetbets,You sell calls above what you think is going to get to and keep moving the a strike as the price rises. He's probably only selling weeklies - in this that expire in a week.
2021-06-29 17:18:48,wallstreetbets,Even better 🦍
2021-06-29 15:50:32,wallstreetbets,"Never been more sure.
I’m not saying tomorrow but it has all the tools to go way higher than 60.

I’m definitely in long term.
Still remember what happened with Etsy and Amazon and I won’t make the same mistake."
2021-06-29 17:36:52,wallstreetbets,I rather be dead anyways so this will get me closer
2021-06-29 17:59:17,wallstreetbets,Rather be dead anyways man

2021-06-29 17:13:53,wallstreetbets,I might have to liquidate other positions if this drops lower.
2021-06-29 14:36:01,wallstreetbets,Anything with about 1.0 in premium currently. Could be 5 strikes away from current price
2021-06-29 16:09:27,wallstreetbets,OK I'm all I'm with you!
2021-06-29 17:22:02,wallstreetbets,"I was looking at exactly that earlier. If everything else wasn't also red today, I definitely would have."
2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What up with $TEVA 

TEVA is routinely bent over without the consideration of being asked it would like some lube first.  They are currently dealing with some court cases in regards to the opioid crisis but what major drug company didn’t have their hand in that cookie jar at the time, J&J for example. Yet TEVA still gets dragged through the Mud. They have also had some shady price fixing issues in the past (just settled one of those cases) but what company hasn’t tried any means possible to still have the competitive advantage, if you ain’t cheating you ain’t trying. 

In the pharmaceutical industry TEVA is everywhere, why does the man continually bend it over?

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$ASO - Undervalued Sporting Giant Unlike a lot of the other random tickers being pushed on this sub recently, **Academy Sports and Outdoors** is a company that *actually does well*.

* **Undervalued** in its booming industry compared to competitors - see comparison
* **Solid financials and growth** \- $ASO does almost half of its market cap in revenue per quarter alone. Net income, profit margins, and EPS have been growing quarterly for the past year.
* **High short interest** at **21.57%** of free float as of last report. Normally, I don't take much interest in this statistic, but if you look at the price chart $ASO has been on the rise for a long time. This means that essentially every short position is in the red, with no indication of the trend reversing anytime soon.
* **Low moving volume at 3.77B market cap** \- currently less than 1M in volume traded today, with absolutely TINY buys and sells moving the stock by insane amounts.
* **Rock bottom IV** on options - currently at **1% percentile** on its 52wk IV range. You **literally** cannot have gotten in lower in the past year.

Like, I cannot make this shit up. Look at this shit.  

# Comparison to $DKS (Dicks Sporting Goods)

So, retail is booming and sporting goods in particular are completing blowing out analyst expectations across the board. $DKS is largest and likely most well known player in the market, with a 9.11B market cap compared to $ASO's 3.77B. Let's take a look at $DKS and $ASO's last earnings.

$DKS reported 2021 Q1 earnings on May 25th and had a conservative consensus estimated EPS of $1.04. $DKS reported EPS of $3.79 and overnight went from a stock price of $84.17 to $98.40, a **17% increase**.

$ASO reported Q1 earnings a couple of weeks later on June 8th and by this time, analysts had come to realize that this was retail's market and posted a consensus EPS estimate of $0.96. Academy said fuck your estimate and posted an EPS of 1.89. Stock price? Went from $37.78 to $39.65, a **5% increase**. Since then, the stock's price has peaked at $42.75 as of last Friday and is currently trading at around $40.90. At this current price, $ASO is fundamentally still undervalued with a lot of room to run. And after yesterday's consolidation, $ASO is primed to sprint its way to $45+ in the very near future. 

# Valuations and Price Target

After their most recent earnings, 4 analysts upgraded $ASO to an average price target of **$45.25.**

https://preview.redd.it/65vv8knc28871.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=baed5832509857bd7ddd96551178b3a8c26b8b15

Although we might not like to admit it, the pros are probably a little better at the whole trading thing than we are. And all signals are furiously pointing at a **strong** buy.

The order book is all kinds of messed up at the moment, with even small buys and sells of shares triggering massive swings in either direction. But given the historically low IV, options are a great, well, option as well."

2021-06-29 12:04:06,wallstreetbets,In the past 3 months I went from 48k to 25k and in the past 3 weeks from 25 to 54k. Literally like 90% of my profit has been ASO. Diversification is for pussies.
2021-06-29 12:09:41,wallstreetbets,"Im retard, im in"
2021-06-29 13:02:18,wallstreetbets,Just think 3 months ago it was at 25 and now it’s sitting pretty at 40. Been on a pretty damn steady upward climb for over a year at this point. I should’ve bought some then smh but it’s okay the money went into amc so I think it was well spent
2021-06-29 15:40:00,wallstreetbets,"the closer this thing gets to 40, the more I buy. going deep on options on dips below 40 has been free money. so undervalued - Smith & Wesson and Nike both just blew out earnings and gapped up. guess who sells A LOT of both?"
2021-06-29 17:14:20,wallstreetbets,Still waiting for this sub to wake up to this heavily shorted deep value play hiding in plain sight.
2021-06-29 14:42:31,wallstreetbets,This is the most beautiful stock on the market today.
2021-06-29 14:28:07,wallstreetbets,"I was planning on buying some back when it was \~$25 in late March, but I ran out of funds and figured Academy wasn't going to go anywhere anytime soon... Was I wrong!

I was able to jump in middle of this month when it dipped around $38.

$45-ish seems like a reasonable target, unless they can increase sales and/or their profit margin.

I think they should have strong sales this summer as I believe people will be doing a lot of outdoors events after being locked down for so long. Likewise hopefully this fall we will see more participation in extracurricular sports.

Guns & ammo are just a small part of Academy, if you've ever been in their stores you would know that probably most of the store is clothing & footwear, then probably camping & fishing, then weights, baseball, basketball, tennis, etc... Firearms is probably the smallest section of the store."
2021-06-29 16:49:16,wallstreetbets,Traded very strange today and IV is all time low. I think its primed for a big move.
2021-06-29 17:15:15,wallstreetbets,This stocks prints like The fed.  It is so reliable. Up up up. Down a little up up up. Down a little up up up.
2021-06-29 18:03:04,wallstreetbets,"After taking profits lat friday, rolled those into more calls today. My portfolio is now just one big ASO"
2021-06-29 11:55:50,wallstreetbets,Im in retard
2021-06-29 14:48:37,wallstreetbets,50 shares at $39 holding strong for $55
2021-06-29 13:43:02,wallstreetbets,"How exactly is ASO undervalued? Technical analysis can show today’s current price is about as high as its ATH. This was a great play when Covid hit, as the public created an artificial shortage by buying out all the guns and ammo. (Supply VS Demand) However that is not the case today, you can see much more inventory and less of a demand than when panic hit last year at the beginning of the Covid shutdowns."
2021-06-29 11:53:25,wallstreetbets,"https://i.imgur.com/vhgkFC3.png

Bought the dip yesterday, held through the highs of > $42 because it's still underpriced."
2021-06-29 12:11:35,wallstreetbets,Sticking with a pick that you're intricately familiar with is a solid strategy for sure. And $ASO is definitely a better pick than some not-to-be-named companies that are shorted for legitimate reasons.
2021-06-29 19:37:43,wallstreetbets,Likely profit taking for institutions as it is quarter end.
2021-06-29 16:41:57,wallstreetbets,"So the supply shortage is actually hurting their firearm sales right now. They noted that on their earnings call and clarified that firearms/ammo are not driving their overall sales growth (the 10-Q actually noted a decrease in firearm sales).

HOWEVER, they have also reported a double digit increase in margins. Management said that the increased margin is being driven by “merchandise”. That’s a very broad category and it happens to include firearms. So it’s entirely possible that firearm sales are driving the increased margins even if they aren’t driving sales growth. If that is the case, it will eventually come to light in the coming quarters. I personally don’t believe that increased firearm margins could account for even half the overall margin increase but time will tell. For now, Management seems to be taking advantage of the better margins by paying down debt.

As for the current price, I’m not sure really sure why the price being at an all time high is relevant here. ASO IPO’d 9 months ago at $12 so it’s always been trading at or near it’s ATH, if not setting a new ATH altogether."
2021-06-29 14:42:13,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you in the sense that I think it's only slightly undervalued right now. I look at this as more of a growth play than a value play. I think some people confuse current true value with an assumed value based on future sales.

That said I love the stock and it will continue to grow."
2021-06-29 14:08:07,wallstreetbets,"You need to look at its current Market Cap along with its current EPS and P/E. All of which indicate a stock that is significantly undervalued.

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/academy-sports-and-outdoors-inc.-nasdaq%3Aaso-shares-could-be-47-below-their-intrinsic-value"
2021-06-29 16:58:28,wallstreetbets,"Check firearm and Ammo price increases during Covid. That might let you know where the margin profit is.

As far as ATH, value investing is actually NOT buying at ATHs, that being said it is a great growth stock as OP has now mentioned."
2021-06-29 15:53:34,wallstreetbets,"Definite growth stock! I like the stock!

P.S. MyPenisMyChoice 10/10 username."
2021-06-29 14:23:56,wallstreetbets,"Right, this is a typical Fundamental Analysis vs Technical Analysis dilema. ASO is a strong company and is here to stay.

From [Yahoo Finance's site](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOFI/key-statistics?p=SOFI):

> Short Ratio (Jun 14, 2021)         3.64

> Short % of Float (Jun 14, 2021) 	N/A

2021-06-29 12:15:15,wallstreetbets,"(I will post this in all SOFI threads, as I sense some pump-and-dump going on)


From [Yahoo Finance's site](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOFI/key-statistics?p=SOFI):

> Shares Short (Jun 14, 2021) 	28.28M

> Short Ratio (Jun 14, 2021)         3.64

> Short % of Float (Jun 14, 2021) 	N/A

> Short % of Shares Outstanding (Jun 14, 2021) 	3.56%

So where is this ""148%"" short interest coming from?

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PLAY giant bull flag I like dave and busters. Smells like Mary Jane every time I step into one. Maybe it's just Colorado.

I never seen a bull flag this big, that's what she said. If my calculations are right (doubt it) when this bull flag breaks out it will reach \~68 dollars reaching an all time high (last all time high was in 2018 @$67).

Finviz does say it has a 19% short interest and it only has a 47 million shares outstanding. The schills say the price target is 52. It's been hugging the channel 39-47.

&#x200B;

Start a position at 39's, or long calls, quarterly results have been up-trending and with summer I believe the bull flag may erectify all our senses.

Currently holding over 2000 shares around $40 cost basis doing weekly out the money covered calls on while waiting for the volume to pick up. We will see if it follows this bull flag through. If it doesn't well you can swing to 45 and buy some tendies at least we tried.

&#x200B;

THe Bull flag is squeezing....Are you in or out you mothasuckas?

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$VRT is the best shit that nobody is talking about As many have pointed out recently, wsb is now just filled with shit about the next SQUEEZE TO THE MOON and 10K NEXT WEEK OR YOU'RE A 🌈 🐻. This stock isn't about that shit, it's about YOLOing on some dope random company I heard about that has been cranking out massive gains to the tune of +40% over the last 3 months and no sign of slowing down.

I'm talkin about VRT, the best value stock on the goddamn market right now. Nobody is trading this shit, it regularly has less than a million in volume a day. ""What the fuck is Vertiv holdings?"" I see you wondering. Well, they're basically the wal-mart of data centers. they supply data centers with everything they need. Server racks, power, air con, i dunno, other shit that data centers need who gives a fuck, they're data centers. They make you get your porn of your wife fucking her boyfriend and his 8 best friends faster.

There's about 3 million data centers in the US, and they upgrade their equipment every 3-5 years. Vertiv works with all of them that aren't shit. Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, all work with Vertiv to supply infrastructure to their farms.

Just look at this 3 month graph and 1 year graph and tell me this shit isn't on a straight shot to the moon. [3 months](https://gyazo.com/bd0047e2dfa283f6c93166c2155e5b72)
[1 year](https://gyazo.com/f837d8f76de0129d53fdaa0b9fac04f7)

At the end of the day, This is a random ass company I found that is in a space that's going to continue to explode with literally trillions of dollars invested in the coming decades, and they're the biggest player in the space. Their current market cap is still under $10B. Insane.

Now obviously my DD blows because i'm not retarded so I didn't waste my time going to business school and i'm not an autist so I have no idea how to look at shit beyond charts and knowing that a supply company in a trillion dollar industry should probably be worth more than 10 billion. I'm just here to let you guys know VRT is the fucking tits, and if y'all wanna look into why more that would be all the better. Get on board and I'll see everyone at the Lambo convention.

I found this shit and instantly Yolo'd my entire portfolio into it, position is 120 $30c 9/17 and 2500 shares."

By this logic, checkout Jabil ($JBL). They provide electronic manufacturing services for a ton of companies like Amazon and Apple being most notable ones. They have similar market cap (9bil) and have a footing in so many industries I don't see how they don't keep going up. They're on a 1yr steady uptrend that seems unstoppable.

After posting my predictoin in the WSB for PLTR i got a lot of heat. I was breaking my own trading rules. Do not go against the crowd. And I closed my short positions on PLTR and immediately bought calls.

Result? 40,000 Gains in 1 week. NEVER go against the crowrd specially WSB.

looking at SOFI and many other stocks that are pumping up, assume you are right that these stocks wont be big or make you buck, but what you are doing is going against the crowd, and it will hit very hard in your trading journey. Yes you can be right once or twice, but you also have to ask yourself, what you dont know that a group of people know.

Be humble. Stay positive.

2021-06-29 12:15:05,wallstreetbets,"(I will post this in all SOFI threads, as I sense some pump-and-dump going on)


From [Yahoo Finance's site](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOFI/key-statistics?p=SOFI):

> Shares Short (Jun 14, 2021) 	28.28M

> Short Ratio (Jun 14, 2021)         3.64

> Short % of Float (Jun 14, 2021) 	N/A

> Short % of Shares Outstanding (Jun 14, 2021) 	3.56%

So where is this ""148%"" short interest coming from?

Sometimes it's worth it to cut your losses and move onto other plays. Not saying that's the case with SOFI, but the ""never sell at a loss"" mentality is kind of silly, IMO."

Luckily I have tutors for both that I can ask these types of questions, but Duolingo is no help at all. I do not think you could actually learn a language using Duolingo (unless it is very similar to a language you already know) but it can be good practice for vocabulary I suppose. 

At best it's a learning supplement but it has terrible monetisation so I don't see how an IPO is going t work. I've been a Duolingo member since 2013, on a 365+ day streak (thanks corona) and I have never paid a single penny. I can't complain for the price of free but if I'm going to spend money on learning a language then Duolingo is not the place I would go."

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"RIG - Supply and Demand for Oil and Recovery Play. Short DD Included Below  With 14% short, which accounts for 74.9 Million shares currently being shorted on this stock. Past 6 months, the Transocean director paid 40.7 million from June 7 to June 22 to purchase 9.9 million shares on the open market, which along with a rising oil price, could potentially be another AMC in the making.

Shorts: Currently there are 569 million shares floating with 7.5% held by insiders, 54.52 held by institutions,s and well over 14% short of float, which accounts for almost 75 million shares of outstanding shares. Given the rising oil price and domestic market recovery, there is an increase in the demand, in addition to the cyclical summer demand for gas.

Insider: Insiders have been scooping up shares, which is an indication of confidence in the stability of oil prices and demand moving forward. ""Transocean director Frederik W. Mohn paid $40.7 million from June 15 through June 22 for a total of 9.9 million shares, a per-share average price of $4.11. Mohn made the purchases through Perestroika AS, a Norwegian investment firm of which he is the sole director and owner, according to a form he filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Perestroika now owns 77.6 million Transocean shares. **It was Mohn’s first purchase of Transocean stock on the open market since 2018**.""

Technical Outlook: Resistance at $4.81 as a 52-week high. Currently, the stock is looking to break out and breakthrough that resistance. I expect the stock will go higher and potentially retest the $4.81 as the new support and then reaches new highs. Next potential resistance at $7.00 range and then at each dollar mark, roughly. However, if short squeezed, the stock price could increase exponentially.

""One of the most conservative Supreme Court justices asserted Monday that federal prohibitions on marijuana ""may no longer be necessary"" if the government looks the other way amid widespread legalization of the drug in states.

If the federal government is ""now content to allow states to act ‘as laboratories' 'and try novel social and economic experiments,'"" then it might ""no longer have authority to intrude"" on states' core police powers, Associate Justice Clarence Thomas wrote."""

It was just a note that usually every time he posts here, it goes down for a bit.

It seems to be the anomaly that ""this is doing well, lets make a post"" and suddenly it does bad. Similar to when you buy a stoc k after its consistently climbing...THEN...it goes down.

Definitely not bashing nor proving him wrong, that's impossible, OP makes my salary in a week on Mattress's. Just stating is all."

2021-06-29 14:25:05,wallstreetbets,No shares ?
2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$PATH UiPath bullish move, not the moon but…at least $80. 15% move coming Got my crayons out again...after technical analysis on $NIO and $PLTR looking like it is working out I thought I would come back with this $PATH UiPath, let's go.

UiPath has been steadily working it's way from all time highs of $90 to sit at $70 right now (down 22%). This is a critical point and in my opinion will begin the reversal and show bullish momentum in the coming weeks. 

There have been a few bearish articles about the stock but from a technical setup this looks like it has just broken out of the descending pattern and if it holds the $68/ 69/ 70 mark a golden cross of moving averages (1/2hr chart) would be imminent. It is currently holding the 50MA on the 2hr chart and a hold of this support level and consolidation at this point is key.

Worth noting if you are following Cathie Wood, Ark own 2.38% and UiPath has a 1.42% weighting in there funds (see below). Further they have been buying the stock since the stocks IPO around 21st April and have bought on the 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 23, 25, 28th of this month around 2.5m shares.

Thoughts?

Potential for WSB APEs to get on this and ride a quality stock back up.

Who is with me? Worth waiting on a slight pullback before buying heavy but this will no doubt move.

If you aren't already in AMC, BB etc you might want to consider this play. In the lead up to next quarter this could be an underrated stock that has fallen under the radar. Thoughts?

How do I insert those moon and rocket symbols??"

2021-06-29 19:30:11,wallstreetbets,I like how basically nobody has mentioned the sell order already in place 😂

2021-06-29 13:47:06,wallstreetbets,what the fuck? you bought at the highest? I guess that's fine since it will skyrocket anyways.
2021-06-29 14:57:30,wallstreetbets,"Instructions unclear, bought more GME"

2021-06-29 12:14:15,wallstreetbets,"(I will post this in all SOFI threads, as I sense some pump-and-dump going on)


From [Yahoo Finance's site](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOFI/key-statistics?p=SOFI):

> Shares Short (Jun 14, 2021) 	28.28M

> Short Ratio (Jun 14, 2021)         3.64

> Short % of Float (Jun 14, 2021) 	N/A

> Short % of Shares Outstanding (Jun 14, 2021) 	3.56%

So where is this ""148%"" short interest coming from?"

2021-06-29 19:58:03,wallstreetbets,Imagine having 800k to yolo
2021-06-29 10:56:39,wallstreetbets,So they can dump it after they come here with their photoshopped million $ pumps lol
2021-06-29 13:22:20,wallstreetbets,"Because is recently merged post spac so its allowed on this sub now. And lock up expiry just passed so people think its near a bottom and due for a rebound. 

Spacs aren't allowed on this sub so before it merged it couldn't be talked about here. I have to imagine a lot of people have been playing this pre and post spac merger. I got into it because I like its long term potential and I had a feeling it would end up being talked about here eventually. I don't have any shares though. Just calls. My cash for shares is tied up elsewhere."
2021-06-29 13:45:28,wallstreetbets,I would be embarrassed to show ANYTHING from the RH site.
2021-06-29 16:29:28,wallstreetbets,Idk but OP disappeared for 6 months without a single comment or post and comes back pumping SoFi. A little strange. Might be worth looking into institutional ownership in SoFi.
2021-06-29 14:12:39,wallstreetbets,Because Chamath Palipoopyface needs a new gym.

2021-06-29 14:28:54,wallstreetbets,Super SUS! All of a sudden it's SoFi? I have a WSB tracker and SoFI wasn't even on the list until this week and now its number #1...
2021-06-29 14:40:17,wallstreetbets,It wasn't allowed on before. I think most who've had it for a while (myself among them) never imagined it getting much attention here anyways so didn't bother.

2021-06-29 13:23:08,wallstreetbets,Yeah all these SOFI posts are from users that have a username of a nonsense string of letters and then a few extra numbers.

2021-06-29 14:02:19,wallstreetbets,"SOFI short interest is at 47% rn, I recall it being 29% (as IPOE). So the pump is kinda justified, either way, I'm long SOFI."

I am a shareholder, as well as a customer.

Download the app and see for yourself. This shit is awesome.

I guess it Could squeeze? But it’s 100% NOT why I’m long.

I’m long because DEFI is the future.

2021-06-29 13:35:22,wallstreetbets,Ok but which is it? You started your sentence with wish then changed it to sofi. Maybe you just dont like wsb? Plenty other subs around for you.
2021-06-29 19:48:24,wallstreetbets,Hahaha I’m always tempted to post my yolo’s but I don’t because my habit to post comments over making posts would mean people just think I’m shilling. Honestly I wish I could get paid for shilling cause they probably pay well but I generally only post about things I put my money on.
2021-06-29 17:09:29,wallstreetbets,"Ok, 1. You aren't going to convince these retards to invest in a legit company if it doesn't have some YOLO gimmick attached. (I am also a shareholder and user of SOFI so I share your sentiment).  2. Most of these retards won't qualify to use SOFI yet because they are still focused on higher income clientele because the banking part hasn't fully kicked in yet, and 90% of the posts I see these days are ""YOLO! Look at my 2 shares of MEMESTONK!"".  Happy to see you are in, though, this company will be trading in the 100's in a couple of years max. Quicker if they get the banking arm rolling later this year."

2021-06-29 19:02:31,wallstreetbets,How do you know?
2021-06-29 13:38:10,wallstreetbets,"Nah wsb is fine, we just need these idiot pump and dumpers to go. I'll continue calling it out when I see it. Also I have no idea wtf you're talking about, I did not edit my comment."
2021-06-29 15:22:29,wallstreetbets,"Maybe the shareholding pump and dumpers should should get lost somewhere between /r/investing and /r/pennystock.  WSB was never about stocks or pump and dumps.

2021-06-29 19:55:33,wallstreetbets,"I actually agree with your statement. Because there is a HUGE difference between Trading and Investing.

2021-06-29 13:51:21,wallstreetbets,What makes SoFi a pump and dump? People on WSB talking about it?
2021-06-29 13:41:11,wallstreetbets,I didnt say edit. I said you started saying people have been talking about *this* p&d then stated that *this* is actually two stocks but no wait its the same p&d for weeks which is it you sound confused
2021-06-29 13:55:02,wallstreetbets,"The price action? Do you know how a pump and dump works? They're getting idiots to increase volume while they offload because their HFT algos need high volume to actually work. This trash was on a downward trend until it got pumped yesterday. Want to point to where all this SOFI hype was 2 days ago, or even weeks ago?"
2021-06-29 15:20:27,wallstreetbets,"SoFi was a spac until weeks ago. Spacs aren't allowed on WSBs. It has been trending up for a couple months pre merger then after merger. It started trending down approaching lockout expiry which was on the 28th. 

As with nearly every stock. Going into lockout expiry there is usually a sell wave followed by a rebound. People talked about it because it was at a potential bottom on lockout expiry. 

It is what it is. I've been holding calls on them pre WSB anticipating this would end up on WSB eventually."

# Why is TTCF about to devour the food industry?

Even if I, and probably tons of you, are beef eaters rather than grass enjoyers, it's estimated that a 100m degenerated in the US right now that are interested in plant-based foods, but there hasn't been enough innovation within their sector to really fulfill their needs. The food industry is dominated by the same companies since the 1950s. However, we've seen starting to disrupt this sector. We want to invest in this innovation, in a way that gives a high probability of great returns. Here comes the most undervalued company in this sector, TTCF and likely in the whole market.

By disrupting the market, TTCF is not competing with anyone right now, they are creating their own market. They are not competing in the plant-based meat category, they are creating a whole array of plant-based foods, but most importantly, products that customers actually like. This is pioneering at its best. I can already hear you saying: oK bUt wHaT aBoUt BYND? Beyond Meat only produces plant-based meat. TTCF has a whole range of plant-based MEALS, like a ratatouille that tastes better than Rémi's and ready in minutes, cauliflower mac & cheese, etc. They have products for everyone. Your average fitness girl that eats her Açai Bowl like a hipster, your risotto for your date night, a pizza for a Football Match. You get the idea.

These guys source all their vegetables from their fields in fucking Italy to get you the best possible Pomodoro on the whole damn planet.

If you don't trust the reviews and think it's all the same person, then look at this.

The sell-through is ridiculous, I have more pictures of empty shelves than photos with my parents. The lucky few who discovered TTCF LOVE the product, there's no doubt about that, but most folks haven't heard of TTCF yet. TTCF hasn't even spent a dime on marketing yet. They've only started their first advertising campaign this quarter!

We know from Walmart data, that people who have tried the product are coming back without any ads. I can guarantee you that this is pretty rare in the food industry. We are witnessing a beast in the making. They are even expanding in the Mexican food industry. Look at the reviews by yourself, they are going to eat Chipotle alive ($42 bn food giant) without a sweat.

Now that they will start marketing, this is going to supercharge sales. Their recent acquisition will allow them to ramp up production and meet this demand.

**TTCF Expansion**

The growth they have is just insane and historical in this industry. They achieved these results without spending a dime in marketing.

https://preview.redd.it/9a4wi21fm7871.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=778a1f7d5d7f0a0c7354702400de3636b73e62b0

They've been conservative on their targets and have always beaten their revenue expectation.

&#x200B;

They are vertically integrated. For the toddlers in the back that have no idea what I'm talking about, it means they own the whole damn supply chain. From the vegetables all the way to the final product. They are constantly increasing capacity to be able to meet demand. This enables TTCF to munch on inflation, as they don't have suppliers.

Essentially, this will guarantee rock-solid margins once they slow down their growth and focus on profitability. This also means they'll be able to diversify out of frozen food. TTCF is super cash-rich with not debt! Other acquisitions are likely to come, increasing their domination in the industry.

Keep in mind that TTCF is only selling in the US for now. They are going to be growing even faster, once they start expanding in Europe and the rest of the world.

&#x200B;

# Valuation

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0j3v5uoam7871.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8e58c8f679372a8d544ded9fcdf56a10e5ea70c

TTCF has more growth and trades at a much lower multiple than its peers. And I've taken the analyst's estimates for 2022 and 2023, but these are rookie numbers and they are very likely to beat them. Indeed, this dumb-ass analyst forgot to do his job and price the catalysts, as explained below.

TTCF is worth about 6 times less than BYND, for example,  but has more growth and trades at a lower multiple. You're essentially getting a BYND but for one-sixth of the price. But most importantly, their products taste 1000x better.

The day TTCF really ramps up marketing and starts doing partnerships with famous people, they'll be trading at a much higher EV/Sales ratio. Just like OTLY with Oprah.

Unlike many other companies on this list, TTCF is not burning cash like there's no tomorrow, and is almost profitable, putting them in a strong position to continue to acquire new companies.

&#x200B;

# Unpriced News and Catalysts

This is where it gets interesting, and for once you have a real hedge. A lot of positive information has not been priced yet, as only 2 analysts are covering the stock. Even on my company's freaking expensive Bloomberg Terminal, there's almost no analysis of the stock. Just Google any of the following catalysts, you'll find nothing. Fortunately for you, I've been following this stock for longer than your wife's had a boyfriend, and this is what I found.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hsopapyfm7871.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&s=3091465438015baa2d2d7a16833322e52576eb6d

**Target Revenue Coming in:**

THE HISTORY OF TARGET! It gets even better. They only launched Target products on March 15^(th). This means that last quarter didn't account for Target's revenue. I had to read their 120 - pages long 10-K 5 times, in order to find that. Of course, there is no way that these two garbage analysts read that.

Analysts expect TTCF to do 54m this quarter, which is only 1m more than they did in Q1. There is absolutely no way, literally impossible that TTCF doesn't beat these numbers by at least 10m, bare minimum. With a nationwide Target presence, these numbers are a piece of cake to beat. On earnings day this could easily pop 15%.

**Kroger Leaked Website:**

On Friday, I was doing a list of all company's selling TTCF products, I noticed a glitch on Kroger's. I entered a specific query in their engine. I  saw a page containing TTCF products, but no announcement was made yet! This is huge. No one has seen that. Considering this is such a big deal. When these two sleepy analysts and the hedgies find this out (any time now), you can expect a very large green dildo. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, suits will soon wake up. You either eat them now or they'll rob you tomorrow. If they have the same success as in Target, my god they're gonna destroy their estimates. The stock could easily rise 10% on the day investors learn this.

https://preview.redd.it/z7hbugogm7871.png?width=1913&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1e17a53b512db9a7f1ec99cc62bedd3eb987ab6

**Russel 3k and 2k:**

Last Friday at the close, TTCF got added into the Russel 3000 and Russel 2000. This will increase awareness of the stock in Wallstreet and most likely prop up prices thanks to passive index tracking.

https://preview.redd.it/uzpyd3p8x7871.jpg?width=488&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44d38ebc4bbb0c8ae49c115a83ce46444f192ca8

&#x200B;

# Price Targets and Outlook

I've been in the market for years and have never seen a stock like this. Considering all the unpriced information, this stock can conservatively hit **$40+** once people find out about Kroger and how ridiculously low the revenue estimates are. **$50+** after earnings, minimum.

A **$100+** is not a stretch. This is stock is a hidden gem.

You can play it like a degenerate gambler and buy calls, but I'd recommend buying shares. Again, I don't care, but do me a favor and buy one share so you'll be able to tell your children you were a shareholder. You'll thank me later

**Positions:**

30k in Aug/Jul Calls

1650 shares

&#x200B;

**TL:DR**

Vegan apes strong together. Have you ever dreamt of a stock where you have more information that even hedgies don't have?  Numerous unpriced catalysts? Ludicrous growth? At a cheap price? Here is TTCF saying yes to all these questions! Bus or Lambo, it is up to you

&#x200B;

2021-06-29 10:49:36,wallstreetbets,"/u/Pendigan

I work within distribution to mass retailers (Target, etc.) and also wanted to provide some insight to your DD. I think it's great DD and I will likely be looking for a position on this company:

* Be careful when evaluating demand based on empty shelves. Currently retail, and specifically mass retail is having a tough time with supply chains both import and domestic. Longer lead times to orders from the point they leave domestic vendors to when they flow through DC's and onto store shelves are making replenishment timelines tough. It doesn't mean it hasn't sold well, but it could also mean they haven't gotten replen in fast enough.
* The $32 per SKU per store metric could be good or bad if we have some additional info on when this metric was taken and when they launched in store. Target has about 1800 stores, but not all products launch to all stores. It's fairly common to see a few hundred stores for specialty products or testing, around 700-800 products for high velocity stores, in the 1100-1200 range to include medium velocity stores, and up to 1800 for all doors. Given their price was around $5 each that would be about 6-7 units per sku per store since launch. If we're talking a couple months the average of 1.0 UPSPW (units per store per week) is pretty good overall (I will disclaimer this that I don't know as much about the grocery metrics as I work in other product categories). If we're talking a couple weeks or less that's awesome.
* Marketing! I trolled Linkedin and noticed on their ""People"" section here: [https://www.linkedin.com/company/tattooedchef/people/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tattooedchef/people/) that they have a Director of Digital Strategy. The Kicker is that she just started there in April of this year. So we can assume with a normal timeline in place that they will be building out strategy, designing, and launching campaigns on social media (she has experience in) and other areas soon. They're not currently hiring any other marketing people from what I saw so they shouldn't need to wait for additional support to begin.
* Target Stores - another point on this, if they do succeed well and are not in all stores yet, it isn't uncommon to be expanded into more stores. However, this would need to happen during a set change timing. Whether that is during a major set like Spring or Fall, or during a minor revision in between could happen, but they need to fit space on the shelf for more product to come in, which means during some form of product change timing. And to ramp up to that takes supply chain production increasing, so there has to be ample time from seeing sales data to being able to deliver product.

&#x200B;

Overall - that was the points I felt I could provide additionally, but happy to answer more questions. I like this after just reading through your DD and will be doing some additional research. Thanks for the info!!"

2021-06-29 16:42:44,wallstreetbets,"I was coming here to say something along the same lines. Empty shelves don't mean a thing right now other than they didn't get restocked.

I appreciate all the work that went into this DD, and I didn't read all of it, but this feels like too much hype. Almost like hype from an insider. Where did the Walmart sales info come from?

I really can't help but poke holes in some of this overly enthusiastic DD. The graphic says 200k sq ft of manufacturing space. That's a pretty good size production facility, but probably just one. Or maybe two medium sized facilities. That sure didn't sound like ""vertically integrated"".

Additionally, vertically integrated doesn't necessarily mean immune to inflation. Inflation right now and forecasted for the food industry isn't because suppliers are getting greedy, it's labor shortages, production capacity limitations, environmental factors, etc. Being vertically integrated just means that the suppliers' headwinds are your headwinds, too. It can cut out a lot of costs, but it can also trap a company into a lot of fixed costs that they might not have otherwise. You expect me to believe that they're sourcing tomatoes from Italy, but also that they are vertically integrated? They own the pomodori fields in Italy? Sounds expensive. I've been there. I've seen how ""insurance companies"" operate there. And even with vertical integration, the food industry operates on thin margins. I don't see this being the Tesla of the food industry.

As far as expanding outside of frozen, that's going to either take serious build out or acquisition. Not that I don't think they can do that, but the costs of integrating an acquired company are significant and they often drag on for a significant amount of time, could be years. Acquisition means taking on additional marketing teams, R&D teams, QA teams, warehousing, etc, and then you have to trim the fat. Build out means you have to build those teams from the ground up. A factory that makes frozen meals is not going to also do bottles sauces. Likewise with R&D teams.

This really doesn't feel industry disrupting either. So it's plant based meals. These aren't cutting edge science meat analogues. These don't look like they are trying to mimic whole muscle chicken made from pea protein or something like that. They're making good, veggie-based meals. It's not something that someone else can't come in and do. Other than branding, there's not much stopping anyone else from coming in and doing their private label version of these. 

All in all, I don't see this mooning. Sorry. I just don't"

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"WOOF is primed for a Angry bull run! Alright ladies and gentlemen. As you know our animal lovers over at Petco have been getting the short stick for the past month. Cramer being his Cramer self said this stock isn’t worth shit. But guess what he doesn’t know? JACK SHIT THATS WHAT. Go look for yourself and see the charts. Ever since it IPOed it’s been on a downward trend and the market is finally starting to pull around. Yesterday saw an increase by 7% off of considerably so-so volume. All $WOOF needs is a little bit of traction and it will continue to run through the week. Easily going to open $23.50-$24.00 and continue a steady uptrend as it builds pressure to pop. The past few days have had huge winners and $WOOF is easily on the list as another 5 bagger at least. Based off its business model alone. This forgets to include

->Insider ownership of 75% during lockup

-> Only 1/4 of the shares available are traded for the public. 55M Float

-> Currently sitting on the dildo that is 31.9% SI

-> Conservative price target of $27.80 but volume will blow past that

I get it there’s meme stocks and shit getting throw everywhere but look at the market the past 2 days. Most of the stocks are flying and WOOF is going lateral for a whole week. Typically time like this makes WOOF ready for a sexy bull run with 🚀🚀🚀

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$SJR Shaw Communications The Mega Acquisition and Earnings Play # Unbiased In-depth DD on Canadian Telecommunications Giant

&#x200B;

***What is Shaw communications?***

website : [https://www.shaw.ca](https://www.shaw.ca)

Shaw Communications is a Canadian cable company that is one of the biggest providers of Internet, television, and landline telephone services in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and northern Ontario. After their acquisition of Wind Mobile in 2016, the company became one of the largest national wireless service provider.

&#x200B;

***Why did price jump from 17$ to 27$ in March?***

&#x200B;

[source : tradingview](https://preview.redd.it/yjwqrke3d7871.png?width=2146&format=png&auto=webp&s=994a42f343a4db2909bb79d5572f403c068c999e)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So let's talk about what happened here on March 15.

* Rogers & Shaw agreed to come together in a C$26 Billion transaction including debt. A deal that would merge two of Canada’s largest telecom conglomerates (second and fourth, respectively).
* Rogers acquired all issued and outstanding class A shares and class B shares for a price of C$40.50 per share in Cash. This reflects a premium of about \~70%.
* Rogers to invest $2.5 billion to build 5G network in Western Canada, driving economic growth and strengthening innovation sector.
* New $1 billion fund dedicated to connecting rural, remote and Indigenous communities to high-speed Internet across the four Western provinces
* Additional $3 billion to support additional network, services, and technology investments.
* Rogers to maintain and grow local Shaw jobs so that teams across Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan will continue to serve customers and support local communities.
* The combined company is committed to continue offering affordable wireless plans, with no overage fees, that meet the budgets and needs of Canadians. As part of this commitment, Rogers will not increase wireless prices for Freedom Mobile customers for at least three years following the close of the transaction.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***Why Shaw communications is a good stock to invest in?***

&#x200B;

* Shaw communications has been providing one of the best internet, TV and phone deals out there in comparison to their competitors.
* They have significantly increased their market share after they re-entered wireless market in 2016.
* In the last 4 years (2016-2020), the company has been successful in increasing their subscribers growth. The company doubled their wireless subscriber base. Not only did they increase their subscriber base, but they also expanded their wireless EBITDA margin by 900 basis points.
* The company was also successfully able to increase average billing per user (ABPU) by 20% and still able to maintain and grow their subscriber base.
* Shaw’s ROICs has stayed between 7.0% and 7.5% for the last five years and is expected to go up once merger has been closed out.
* The Canadian government is keen on bringing wireless competition to the big three incumbents. Unlike previous national upstarts, Shaw's strong financial position and family control afford it the time and money to stick with a long-term strategy to succeed.

&#x200B;

***Are there any risks?***

Yes, of-course there are risks. There is no free money in this world and returns are directly proportionate to the risk. Let's talk about the risk below:

&#x200B;

* The largest merger since 2000 could not actually be approved. The companies are expected to close the merger by early 2022.
* The largest telecom merger has set off some alarms in the eyes of regulatory. Many investors and analysts believe that regulatory risks are imminent. However, if this merger closes out and deal goes through then the merger could significantly reduce competition in mobile wireless markets in cities and provinces across the country.
* The earnings are tomorrow (7/30) after hours. Earnings are always a risk so if you're a risk averse investor then you should be waiting for earnings results.
* The biggest risk is that the merger with Rogers fails to gain regulatory approval, so there is significant downside if the merger doesn’t go through but only limited upside if it does.
* Shaw is overly concentrated in its wireline business, which accounts for 80%-90% of revenue and profits, there are not doing very well in television and landline phone subscribers.
* When the press release came out, Shaw shares surged 45%, and the stock is currently trading at C$35.59, which is still 12% below the deal price. This 12% discount is for regulatory approval, which is a big challenge and could jeopardize the deal. But Rogers and Shaw wouldn’t have taken such a big step if they were not confident of the deal’s success.

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SOFI - So Fly  **What is Sofi?**

Social Finance ($SOFI) is a jack of all trades finance app which recently went public through a reverse merger. Sofi has features such as **Checking Accounts, Credit Cards, Stock Investing,  Student Loan Refinancing and Origination, Personal Loans, Mortgage Refinancing, Auto Loan Refinancing** **and Early Payday, so you can blow your Wendy’s paycheck 2 days earlier.** The vast array of products they offer and partnerships they have formed with other companies gives them a unique ability to cross-sell their products to customers and retain customers by doing so. For example, someone may come to SOFI refinance their gender studies student loans, but end up banking and investing with them. This is because of a singular key factor. **Convenience.** Sofi’s target audience for their products are millennials who are financially savvy. What do we know about millennials? They value convenience. It’s why people will use Grubhub, Doordash or Uber-Eats despite the absurd fees and cold tendies they receive; why people will use Amazon Prime to order stuff rather than go in person; why people will use Robinhood despite it going down every time something interesting actually happens in the market. This creates a dynamic where people will switch over their entire financial life to Sofi in order to simplify things, and makes Sofi in many ways, a superapp in the making, similar to that of Alipay.

[ Sofi has worked out deals with big banks so that retail can get an equal footing in IPO’s. Provided a Sofi member has $3,000 in their Sofi Invest account, they are eligible to get in on an IPO at the IPO’s reference price, as opposed to market price.  ](https://preview.redd.it/pnyzn6ihf7871.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=c24282bb20dd3571b020b51616a3ecf5b4c23eea)

**Financials?**

When we hear the term lending, we probably think of some Big Short Michael Burry subprime fuckery, but that is not what we have here today. Sofi deals with high quality customers with good income and good credit scores, rather than degenerates like you. Because of this, they can run a business model that is beneficial to all parties involved. Sofi can charge lower interest rates due to the low risk of default on any lending they do, and customers can get low interest rates with flexible payment options. This provides a good experience for customers and helps Sofi retain them, or better yet, cross-sell them on other products. As it stands now, Sofi’s bread and butter is Business to Consumer (B2C) lending, which makes up a large portion of their revenue, however as time goes on and we see an expansion and more adoption of their financial services (Banking, Credit Cards, Investing), we will see this shift to be more diversified. Sofi projects 43% CAGR, which is far above other companies in the sector, such as PayPal and Square, who project 20.2% and 29.3% respectively. Sofi will be profitable this year as well, and by 2025 will be raking in Billions of dollars in annual profits. Overall, Sofi is in a very healthy position with a boatload of cash on hand ready to expand the business, be it through acquisitions, or building out products.

**Moat?**

Sofi is a very unique business. Due to it’s jack of all trades nature, it is hard to pinpoint a singular company which compares to it. It shares aspects with dozens of companies, such as investing with Robinhood/Webull/Chime/Acorns, banking with legacy banks such as GS/JPM/BAC/WFC, and many other companies who parallel Sofi. With this said, Sofi has a ***massive*** advantage over other fintech platforms. **Galileo**. No, not the astronomer. **Galileo** is to Sofi what AWS is to Amazon. **Galileo** is a fintech API which powers many of the fintech companies we know and love (or hate) today. Companies such as Robinhood rely on **Galileo** to power aspects of their business, such as issuing debit cards and opening accounts. What this means for all you smoothbrains out there, is that as those companies grow and gain members, Sofi gets a cut of that. Though Robinhood is the most well known of the companies handled by **Galileo**, there are dozens of others who all rely on it to power their businesses.

**Price Action?** 

[Crayon Says Stock Go Uppies 🚀](https://preview.redd.it/fy6qenk0g7871.png?width=1560&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd43b211a2f8a431bb6ac5194bbab4d14bd26989)

Because some of you smooth brained degenerates might not know how to draw with crayons, I will do it for you. Sofi has been in an overall uptrend since it’s merger deal was announced earlier this year. In February, Sofi peaked at an ATH of 28.2 dollars, right before the Inflation Boogaloo made the markets throw a fit. From then it’s had some choppy price action but has continued in it’s uptrend. Recently, Sofi has dropped due to Pipe unlocking, allowing them to sell.

**Pipe?**

No, not the lead thing you licked as a kid, putting your room-temp IQ ass on the path to WSB. PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) is when big investment firms are offered the ability to invest before a merger is announced at a favorable price. In doing this, their shares are locked up for a period of time so that they don’t immediately sell. As of last Friday, PIPE investors were able to sell their shares if they wanted. On Friday and Monday, we saw high volume price action with lots of volatility. Friday was somewhat brutal for holders, but Monday not only presented opportunities for dip buying, but had a great close. Sofi rejected the lows of 17.6 and closed at 19.4, significantly above the $18 support level. TLDR? **Stock Goes Uppies Tomorrow.** 🚀🚀🚀🚀

![img](w8625038g7871 ""
Sofi Pipe consists of ⅔ investors who likely have no plans on selling, and ⅓ funds who would likely sell. With over 94 million volume the past 2 trading days, it is very likely they have all sold, setting us up to 🚀"")

**Short Squeeze?**   


Sofi currently has over **28 million** shares short sold, with borrow fees costing hundreds of % in fees. Admittedly, some of this is due to PIPE holders hedging their positions (Long PIPE shares, Short shares on the open market), but there is almost certainly some non pipe related shorts. There are almost no shares available to short at any given time however, and retail are getting paid **46% interest** just for diamond handing shares and lending them. Pretty sweet right? With the bullish price action today and high short interest, this could be a powder keg ready to be set off with rocket fuel 🚀.

[Screenshot from IborrowDesk shows high borrow rates with few shares available to borrow.](https://preview.redd.it/u9mngtpcg7871.png?width=1331&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c82f361102f7fb7e0064e546bcb5ed6fa081a2e)

**Catalysts?** 

Sofi is currently in the process of becoming a chartered bank. What this means is that they have to get government approval and become an FDIC approved entity, so if they blow up like Bear Stearns, your $50.33 checking account is protected. Sofi recently purchased a bank with an existing charter so that instead of getting a brand new charter, they can simply request a transfer of control. This will speed up the process, and although the bank charter will probably be approved later this year, any positive news earlier could set this stock off. Sofi will also release earnings most likely in July, and it is seemingly likely they will smash estimates which make stock go 🚀.

**Sofi Stadium and Noto.**

The CEO of Sofi is simply put, a baller. Anthony Noto was a football superstar in college, an Army Ranger, and has worked in high level positions for Goldman Sachs, The NFL and Twitter before joining Sofi. Every company needs to advertise, and how did Noto choose to do this? He named a fucking stadium. That's right, when your boomer dad is watching football, it could be at Sofi Stadium. Sofi stadium is situated in LA, and is home to the LA Rams and Chargers. It also facilitates lots of other venues.

On Monday, Sofi had a massive amount of short term call options bought with strikes between $10-$20. You know what this means? Gamma Squeeze.

2021-06-29 16:00:45,wallstreetbets,Yassss! I bought 575 shares back when it was $24.13 and I’m only down 21%!
2021-06-29 10:06:38,wallstreetbets,If it hits $19 im balls deep
2021-06-29 14:14:34,wallstreetbets,Does this guy work for SOFI? Hell of a DD. Sold me on the pics with the green lines!
2021-06-29 09:27:50,wallstreetbets,SOFLY 🚀
2021-06-29 09:26:51,wallstreetbets,tldr: SOFI fucked my mom and now its on its way to fuck yours too. Setting 100k market buy now
2021-06-29 09:42:09,wallstreetbets,"I'm a simple man. I see SOFI, I upvote"
2021-06-29 10:53:00,wallstreetbets,"Its odd, even googling the stock comes up with positive articles. That's a first."
2021-06-29 09:27:04,wallstreetbets,You sonavabitch! I’m already in
2021-06-29 11:40:57,wallstreetbets,Anyone have a bear thesis before I yolo this bitch?
2021-06-29 16:34:28,wallstreetbets,Investing on fundamentals is always a winning strategy. This company has tranches and tranches of positive catalysts.
2021-06-29 09:29:58,wallstreetbets,"I’m white rice bland. 6500 shares worth, tho."
2021-06-29 12:14:21,wallstreetbets,"You all need to be careful. The amount of accounts posting that are less than a year old is alarming. These accounts have Chad holding diamond hands and awards for “avid voter” and “prolific commenter” and are 150 days old. Hedge funds are in here trying to manipulate you into giving them your money. 

OP himself has a limited amount of posts and two of those posts are “Tests”. Who the fuck posts “Tests”?"
2021-06-29 12:20:40,wallstreetbets,"Good DD. Little correction, private investors were allowed to sell their shares Monday, PIPE are still locked in until July 26th. I’m bullish on the company with 600 shares like a boomer"
2021-06-29 09:37:10,wallstreetbets,This thing is bouncing around like a 1980s Superball
2021-06-29 13:36:15,wallstreetbets,"$SOFI is the way, exactly the same pattern as CLOV - a dip to shake out the paper hands before the real show begins"
2021-06-29 11:09:04,wallstreetbets,Just got into SOFI this morning. The volume is insane but my plan is long term and not as a trade.
2021-06-29 19:56:50,wallstreetbets,"So based on OPs own TA positioning, there's a better open just north of 16 we should expect to see in about 2-3 weeks, and we're buying against momentum right now. Why aren't we just waiting to get this at 16, buying puts, and then reversing after July monthlies expire?

I like making money, not being used as a pawn in a bunch of bagholders' short term pump and dumps.

&#x200B;

Edit: On second thought, I used a quick channel tool to trace the same dates that OP did on his calendar. He's lying about the channel being positive; it trends slightly negative from January 7th to today. He's intentionally cut out candle dates and most recent activity to make SOFI appear better than it is. If you wanted to play this according to the TA channel, you're looking for a support closer to 14-15 and its going to take about a month (in August, likely looking at October+ calls) before you want to enter."
2021-06-29 09:58:55,wallstreetbets,"23 hours to type all of that. 23 seconds for me to scroll past,  agree, and yolo into Sofi. If someone takes that much time to type, it must be good. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|trollface)"
2021-06-29 12:28:42,wallstreetbets,Sofi down 0.5% yet calls up like 10+%. Pretty sure this post caused it.

SoFi is my biggest position by far. This thing is going to blast off to the next solar system. 

An entry at these levels is very low risk with immense upside."

2021-06-29 12:54:37,wallstreetbets,"This feels more like a way to circumvent the ""promotion"" title and costs.

I watched it hover from 20-23, then down to 17, up to 21 again, dumped back down to 18 now.  I think it will be 15 soon so I wouldn't hold long.  Appears to be a dump happening if you ask me."

I'm using the app freetrade and I'm in the UK if that's any help.

2021-06-29 11:10:39,wallstreetbets,Divide and conquer tactic.  This is the droid your looking for... not!
2021-06-29 12:16:48,wallstreetbets,"(I will post this in all SOFI threads, as I sense some pump-and-dump going on)


From [Yahoo Finance's site](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOFI/key-statistics?p=SOFI):

> Shares Short (Jun 14, 2021) 	28.28M

> Short Ratio (Jun 14, 2021)         3.64

> Short % of Float (Jun 14, 2021) 	N/A

> Short % of Shares Outstanding (Jun 14, 2021) 	3.56%

So where is this ""148%"" short interest coming from?

Disclaimer: I have no interest in SOFI, just WSB.."
2021-06-29 12:21:17,wallstreetbets,So sus imo…another pump and dump

2021-06-29 10:10:45,wallstreetbets,"OP assumes a lot giving me credit for a room temperature IQ (unless he meant Celsius) and $50.33 in my bank account.

OP also forgot to mention that SOFI stadium will just begin holding fans this year so name recognition starts this year, give them a few years to expand and then it acts as host stadium for the 2028 OLYMPICS which will be a great time for SoFi to expand their international brand. 

By then I plan on competing in Lunar Pole Vault for our new WSB lunar nation."
2021-06-29 11:39:30,wallstreetbets,Same

2021-06-29 13:52:28,wallstreetbets,"The only bear thing I can think of is it's pretty small MC so it's prone to manipulating. But that also means you can forget the moon,, it has room to Pluto."
2021-06-29 15:03:07,wallstreetbets,"It seems to me that even if it’s a hedge fund shill though, they also want the stock price to go up. Sure it’s so they can dump their shares, but if you time it right there is still money to be made"
2021-06-29 13:41:56,wallstreetbets,Yuuupppp this whole thing smells like paid promotion. I mean... look at the fucking post? It's literally just shilling a stock.
2021-06-29 13:40:18,wallstreetbets,"yep there are HF shills here no doubt, but SOFI is a solid play, it hasn't taken off yet with a lot of upside, 

remember 8m new accounts joined after the January GME squeeze so I don't think you can just say everyone under 12 months works for the HFs"
2021-06-29 17:05:52,wallstreetbets,Thank you. I was waiting to see a post like this followed by numerous responses that are actually of substance
2021-06-29 12:54:07,wallstreetbets,yup this is full of bot comments. clearly this DD is not written by a real retard
2021-06-29 13:26:35,wallstreetbets,Looks like this is your first rodeo. I see this shit all the time because I wake up really early. This entire damn sub is a disaster right now.
2021-06-29 16:03:36,wallstreetbets,"Ahh yes. Because people can not have new accounts or alt-accounts. Any DD or rise in popularity for a stock you’re not in must be ”bots and hedge fund manipulation”. Grow up and take your tinfoil hat off.

SoFi is a unicorn and more than a solid play. The DD in this thread was fine. Anyone going in shares will multiply their position probably by 3-5x within 2-3 years. 

I’ve been here since the sub was at 150k members but I’ve since started using another new account for a variety of reasons. While I agree that the sub has gone to the shitter via the GME-saga and there is a lot of manipulation and PnDs, this is not one of them. There’s solid discussions and DD on WSB still every now and then. SoFi is a quality company comparable to e.g. PLTR, TSLA, and AMD in terms of solid fundamentals.

You do you, but your saltiness is showing kiddo."
2021-06-29 19:20:30,wallstreetbets,"Who the fucking fuck cares. If DD is solid, I don't give a flying fuck if a bot posted it. Make your own independent decisions. 

HFs don't exist for the sole purpose of fucking over retail investors. If they can pump a stock to 1000%, they'd do that over selling at 100%. Make your own judgement. You're not ""fighting against the HFs"".

I take it as a given that every stock here is going to ""PND"" at some point. That's the nature of stocks that get attention, regardless of where it comes from - WSB, cramer, WSJ. When it catches attention, it rises and then people sell at the top to get their gains. That's not a fucking PND."
2021-06-29 16:05:22,wallstreetbets,"Chamath is a snake oil salesman.

2021-06-29 18:14:36,wallstreetbets,this aint DD it's 100% positive with no downsides at all you should at least present risks/bearish case in a DD.

2021-06-29 11:40:59,wallstreetbets,Did the original post say the Raiders and get edited? I didn't see that on my read through. Chargers and Rams should be playing at SoFi stadium this season.
2021-06-29 12:30:38,wallstreetbets,I just picked up 55 shares. To the moon boys.
2021-06-29 14:33:35,wallstreetbets,What's up with your comment history? You shillin'?
2021-06-29 13:24:59,wallstreetbets,gamma squeeze deez nuts.
2021-06-29 14:00:51,wallstreetbets,Chamath definitely is pulling strings within WalStreetBets as well. If you listen to him you know he’s hyper aware of this group and his ability to manipulate it
2021-06-29 14:04:15,wallstreetbets,I have a couple hundred shares as well. Lookin to add some LEAPS. What’re your strikes on those?
2021-06-29 14:26:02,wallstreetbets,This is a shill. 100%. Chamath just paying some fucktard to imitate WSB DD.

2021-06-29 12:30:48,wallstreetbets,"Pump and dump schemes. You’ll notice every couple days here there’s a new “amazing can’t lose position!” thy gets weirdly promoted by tons of people, a sudden huge uptick in “i yolod 200k into [stock] to the moooon!!” 

People buy in, the stock rockets for a short time, the big guys dump the stock, it craters, then the bag holders start pumping it to try to maintain some dignity, everyone forgets about it, bag holders get stuck cause it happens so fast, then the next “can’t lose position! I yolod 1 milly!!” posts come in and the cycle repeats. 

Last one was WISH. New one is SOFI."

Ford has 3.92 BILLION shares outstanding. I'm not saying it won't move; I'm saying it moves as fast as your mom's station wagon. In the mud. With slick tires. And it's raining."
2021-06-29 13:29:52,wallstreetbets,so far I'm up like 25% on F but this forum fucking hates this stock I wouldn't bother talking about it on WSB

2021-06-29 17:51:09,wallstreetbets,Oh brother I bought a bunch of calls and for some reason nobody is seeing what infinite upside $F has to offer! I’m in on this flying starting tomorrow and printing some lucrative gains

2021-06-29 09:20:55,wallstreetbets,Well it moved 3 dollers in 2 months….. did it just gain traction for a second or is it more like your mud truck with 40 inch meats on there about to break out
2021-06-29 09:31:56,wallstreetbets,Not to mention their current model lineup isnt exactly appealing to the eyes. Theres always next cycle.
2021-06-29 09:07:53,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao. Citadel isn't even in the top 10 list of institutional investors for Ford. They barely hold about .5% of the shares, nowhere near enough to tank the stock. 

This is peak retardation and FUD."
2021-06-29 09:11:05,wallstreetbets,F will outperform TSLA between now and 2030
2021-06-29 09:01:25,wallstreetbets,"Not this week, but this summer"
2021-06-29 10:45:16,wallstreetbets,"A $3 move that translates to an increase of mkt cap of $11,760,000,000. Think about it... unless they make huge increases in value, your shares aren't going *anywhere*. Do you think the news was worth $11.76 billion more in valuation? Let's say Tesla goes under for whatever reason, and F suddenly has their portion of the market and increases in value by their current MC... They're still only at $182.58/share, all else being equal."
2021-06-29 09:25:51,wallstreetbets,moved 3 dollars in 2 months after 3 of the biggest releases in Ford's history. soooo ya
2021-06-29 09:44:00,wallstreetbets,Electric mustang looks like a suv.
2021-06-29 11:06:43,wallstreetbets,"Bad example because TSLA doesn't have much of the car market sans EV and even their % of the EV market is shrinking due to increased competition.

TSLA has to start monetizing and building out the rest of their promises just to stay where they are let alone growing their stock price.

F just needs to keep executing and rolling out more thoughtfully designed models and the stock price should go up but it will never command the market cap of TSLA.

F vs TSLA stock is a fools comparison as they are not valued on the same metrics."
2021-06-29 10:15:56,wallstreetbets,So yea … wtf has Tesla done except the same thing on a smaller scale but there price is what…..? So Ford has switched to ev 2 months ago and proved it so there stock is stuck….. yup makes sence
2021-06-29 11:14:08,wallstreetbets,"It was just a marketing gig rather than having anything to do with the mustang brand.

Like Porsche makes SUV now and 4 door ""sedans"".

Electric F-150 is going to sell like hot cakes and is hitting the market just about right as competitor models are only coming to market late this year at the earliest."
2021-06-29 11:17:37,wallstreetbets,Yea remind me in a year when speculation slows down… Tesla stock is prices like 2 to 3 years out earnings …. Just wait
2021-06-29 10:21:21,wallstreetbets,are you dumb?  tesla has 21% float of Ford. I know we are all a bunch of retards but you sir are the leader
2021-06-29 11:16:27,wallstreetbets,The f-150 looks like it should for sure. Just to me the mustang should have had a different name.
2021-06-29 10:25:37,wallstreetbets,Tesla boys think every peice of good news from Tesla deserves a 50 doller jump in stock price yet Ford sells way more cars has way more infrastructure that Tesla is a fraction of Ford yet the company is worth waaaaay more than Ford…. So yea wtf u talking about
2021-06-29 11:21:58,wallstreetbets,"Yes, the Mach-E should not have mustang as part of its name. I think it was a decision made solely for marketing purposes.

 That being said it has been selling like crazy and everything I have read and heard about it, it is a very good EV."
2021-06-29 10:30:02,wallstreetbets,its about how many shares are purchasable.   smoothest of brains. look up some youtube videos or something lmao

2021-06-29 09:07:51,wallstreetbets,Bought $20 July 2nd calls yesterday when RSI was oversold to around $18 due to expiry lockout FUD.  Fundamentals are strong and calls continue to print.  This is a great stock to swing and hold.
2021-06-29 11:57:27,wallstreetbets,Is this a buy atm?

2021-06-29 10:06:58,wallstreetbets,I'm aware of RSI but where do you find RSI on stocks tho? Do you have a screener or anything?
2021-06-29 14:02:22,wallstreetbets,"SOFI is a reasonably safe bet at these levels, the company is sound with good mgmt and growth prospects, the price hasn't gone mad so the downside is limited and unlike AMC this is a company worth holding onto which will only get better the longer you own it"

2021-06-29 08:49:57,wallstreetbets,Overreaction of market is what I’m assuming. The machine has issues so they are being smart to not force production and just hide it under the rug. It shows they want to give out excellent products and not some half ass shit just because of money. I see it as bullish it expects the machine to be up again in mid july so its not like its out forever. Waiting for 1PM to hear their IR info.

All of those stocks are going to keep going down.  You bought at the tippy top of the pump and we are still nowhere close to bottoming out.  SPCE and GME especially and that is where you have the most exposure....

Those stocks are not going back up to those levels for a very long time, if ever.  Hodling is not the right call here.

You still have a lot of money left to make it back with if you were to just eat your sunk costs and start over.

When we have Ivy on the table and all the patent deals. We come back and talk to the apes. Good news that's not too far off. We are not looking for $20 at that point. It will be $50 by the time everything's comes to life and our wait will be well wourth it.

2021-06-29 13:15:42,wallstreetbets,No question that with wkhs 40% Short intrest it can go big time. I had it the day it went up 50%! I've always had good luck with this one. Also if it closes out Friday above $18 it could gamma squeeze

They killed gme and every other movement along with it. Its just all bots repeating tickers over and over now."

2021-06-29 10:41:24,wallstreetbets,I believe it is way more shorted then what is reported due to naked shorting. It would make sense as they did not want to attract the wsb crowds attention and are well aware of this by now. But i Do not have hard proof
2021-06-29 17:23:11,wallstreetbets,WKHS off to the races tomorrow… 🐴 🚀 🌙
2021-06-29 15:44:03,wallstreetbets,Giddy up Horsey!!!
2021-06-29 10:46:13,wallstreetbets,WKHS gang assemble!
2021-06-29 11:41:07,wallstreetbets,I'm excited for money
2021-06-29 11:55:47,wallstreetbets,I think we are all learning that us normies don’t have as much say so as we thought. Other bigger guys I think are choosing what moons
2021-06-29 11:50:05,wallstreetbets,We will wait. The future looks bright.
2021-06-29 11:59:17,wallstreetbets,Why would the patents not be included in the stock price before it memed? That’s literally part of a valuation
2021-06-29 10:38:08,wallstreetbets,"Lol do the math, WKHS might be 20 times better"
2021-06-29 10:43:47,wallstreetbets,I went with wkhs
2021-06-29 10:39:24,wallstreetbets,Horsey. And it not even close
2021-06-29 10:46:48,wallstreetbets,Both here🚀🚀
2021-06-29 15:25:45,wallstreetbets,Best I figured it's about 41% SI this morning but arount 20% of the 60% SI the previois day was covered with float so my guess WKHS really has close to a 65% SI after today.
2021-06-29 14:19:13,wallstreetbets,Lol.. I feel ya.. I've averaged down so my moon is $2 away
2021-06-29 09:58:28,wallstreetbets,RIP
2021-06-29 15:39:38,wallstreetbets,"WKHS doesn't need hay, WKHS wants tendies!"
2021-06-29 16:30:17,wallstreetbets,Hold. Hedges need price to go down so far we have only brought it up. Hedges are losing more money everyday that we hold and if we stay on current track I thinks our chances are very good for take off.
2021-06-29 15:58:26,wallstreetbets,patience.. we've been pushing this up slow and steady priming for take off
2021-06-29 16:10:36,wallstreetbets,"I’m still hanging out with 777 shares 😎

Lost $1500 in call options last week though 😒"
2021-06-29 15:50:29,wallstreetbets,Why
2021-06-29 15:52:45,wallstreetbets,Fucking honestly….
2021-06-29 16:52:00,wallstreetbets,Dude I just keep adding
2021-06-29 12:15:14,wallstreetbets,Amc
2021-06-29 11:54:02,wallstreetbets,Liquidate both and rethink your life
2021-06-29 12:31:23,wallstreetbets,BB has done nothing but disappoint me
2021-06-29 14:50:54,wallstreetbets,😬 bb will come back
2021-06-29 16:06:32,wallstreetbets,A horse is a horse of course of course but the horse!!! WKHS 🚀🌙
2021-06-29 15:25:30,wallstreetbets,BB
2021-06-29 15:28:03,wallstreetbets,You know it’s WKHS time
2021-06-29 16:46:17,wallstreetbets,I love both. Blue berry is one of my favorite fruits. I will go pick more. I love to ride on HORSE aka WKHS
2021-06-29 19:07:11,wallstreetbets,🐎
2021-06-29 19:42:33,wallstreetbets,HORSE
2021-06-29 15:34:30,wallstreetbets,BB is u dum
2021-06-29 16:00:50,wallstreetbets,Time for more BB
2021-06-29 16:52:23,wallstreetbets,"Genuine question here, I’m sorry if this comes off as dumb. But why exactly is this one going to pop? At first glance it seems possible, but I also noticed where it suddenly had a steep decline dropping more than half in 20 days. Was it shorted? Sorry again if this sounds dumb, I’m still trying to learn the ins and outs of the speculative side of things

Edit: the drop in mentioning is between feb4 and feb24"
2021-06-29 10:12:42,wallstreetbets,How do you do that? Do you just set the strike price for a low amount or what?
2021-06-29 10:18:47,wallstreetbets,Yeah how
2021-06-29 13:43:51,wallstreetbets,Happy birthday !🎉🎉🎉🎂🚀🦍🌕
2021-06-29 13:49:05,wallstreetbets,happy birth!
2021-06-29 09:17:24,wallstreetbets,Same!
2021-06-29 09:20:54,wallstreetbets,"Gtfo 
Wkhs can’t even win a contract , stop building caste in the air"
2021-06-29 09:21:30,wallstreetbets,I’d buy now before you have to buy in the 20s
2021-06-29 09:20:54,wallstreetbets,Nah you’ve got time friend.
2021-06-29 09:20:18,wallstreetbets,Still early. Minimum 100
2021-06-29 09:20:08,wallstreetbets,I bought 16 00 and yesterday 17.60
2021-06-29 09:25:14,wallstreetbets,"The play on WKHS has been trying to force covers for the massive short interest and hopefully gap back up to $30+.  Its risky all this is risky but this has a large portion of the float shorted and many believe the company which has its struggles shouldnt be as low as it is.  

Might tank, might gap up, and maybe its the next amc.   Or maybe I'm retarded.

I just like the stocks potential and I like losing money."
2021-06-29 09:23:30,wallstreetbets,It’s going to $100 minimum
2021-06-29 09:26:48,wallstreetbets,Buy that shit up u retard
2021-06-29 12:32:41,wallstreetbets,"Picture it, 2023, the ones that were bagholding finally post on wsb that it was always the play."
2021-06-29 13:48:30,wallstreetbets,you had me at 🐎🐎
2021-06-29 14:28:54,wallstreetbets,WKHS gang 🚀
2021-06-29 15:33:04,wallstreetbets,Bigger wall getting chewed up at 17.54
2021-06-29 16:15:45,wallstreetbets,I wish any news would break on WKHS…ANYTHING and it would take off
2021-06-29 15:48:20,wallstreetbets,"18.50, ive based this purely on ape instinct"
2021-06-29 16:01:23,wallstreetbets,Solid 20

2021-06-29 09:33:46,wallstreetbets,Hell yes
2021-06-29 10:03:13,wallstreetbets,I would cream
2021-06-29 10:16:58,wallstreetbets,"That's the way, $WKHS likely pushing $18 by EOD IMO"
2021-06-29 11:01:32,wallstreetbets,We are only .2 below open on chart. mostly market manipulation
2021-06-29 11:04:20,wallstreetbets,Shorts are trying to shake out some new buyers
2021-06-29 12:41:10,wallstreetbets,It's a dildo machine
2021-06-29 13:44:32,wallstreetbets,You will be knighted and dine on tendies 🍗🐔
2021-06-29 16:20:08,wallstreetbets,It should run if it can get to $18
2021-06-29 15:16:58,wallstreetbets,Horses still running strong
2021-06-29 09:15:40,wallstreetbets,🤑
2021-06-29 09:17:31,wallstreetbets,WKHS not waiting for you to 🚀
2021-06-29 09:58:31,wallstreetbets,"Analysis confirmed, I just got a chubby 🍆"

2021-06-29 10:13:00,wallstreetbets,BUY BUY BUY BUY $$$$
2021-06-29 10:19:57,wallstreetbets,That massive volume yesterday was fantastic.
2021-06-29 10:44:44,wallstreetbets,"40.62% SI of FF, utilization 97.47% (from Ortex)"
2021-06-29 10:43:59,wallstreetbets,SI is really 70%+
2021-06-29 11:35:32,wallstreetbets,Yesh.
2021-06-29 11:40:31,wallstreetbets,Let’s race our lambos is Miami together later this summer
2021-06-29 12:17:09,wallstreetbets,Why WKHS?
2021-06-29 12:14:33,wallstreetbets,"No idea, it’s shorted to hell and there’s no time frame. Just be patient and hold if you’re convinced. WKHS. 

Also, possible catalyst, the court filing against UPS went public yesterday. Check it out."
2021-06-29 12:00:11,wallstreetbets,"After lunch hours through EOD, Then through next two weeks"
2021-06-29 13:34:01,wallstreetbets,It's starting..
2021-06-29 13:47:34,wallstreetbets,Shorts are stubborn and clinically insane with the depth they will dig. But $WKHS apes are diamond handed and we already know who has the winning hand.
2021-06-29 15:21:35,wallstreetbets,Who argues with science?
2021-06-29 15:47:00,wallstreetbets,Giddy up Horsey!!!
2021-06-29 16:54:05,wallstreetbets,WILD HORSE

2021-06-29 16:51:46,wallstreetbets,I'm dying under the weight of these $15 bags
2021-06-29 18:22:49,wallstreetbets,Whys it cuckin me though
2021-06-29 10:30:07,wallstreetbets,"Always, So much resistance at $18 but if that breaks the game is on"
2021-06-29 08:29:56,wallstreetbets,I heard his fadda was a mudda
2021-06-29 08:32:35,wallstreetbets,$WKHS wants to run. I've got her loaded to the tilt
2021-06-29 10:25:51,wallstreetbets,Or buy the predictable $WKHS dip every single morning at 10 - 11. That's my plan. That and diamond hand it to $100+
2021-06-29 08:59:35,wallstreetbets,Buy and hold WKHS. Target 100-200-400$
2021-06-29 10:26:40,wallstreetbets,Every day at this time. $WKHS then sprints to the close
2021-06-29 15:15:02,wallstreetbets,AMC gonna moon 🚀
2021-06-29 15:14:06,wallstreetbets,Just waiting 30 more minutes so I can buy this little dip up
2021-06-29 15:15:37,wallstreetbets,Say it every week and eventually you’ll be right
2021-06-29 15:12:19,wallstreetbets,High charisma... I'm in! 👩‍🚀
2021-06-29 15:15:36,wallstreetbets,LETS GOOOO!!🔥🔥🔥
2021-06-29 15:22:50,wallstreetbets,Bets on Tuesday
2021-06-29 15:23:41,wallstreetbets,Can I just get a 62 and a holuluigie
2021-06-29 16:22:53,wallstreetbets,Ya and it seems to be getting cheaper by the day!
2021-06-29 16:43:07,wallstreetbets,IT is getting cheaper. Do you think it will reach to  the moon sooner?
2021-06-29 18:23:18,wallstreetbets,The hero we didnt need but certainly deserved
2021-06-29 09:50:33,wallstreetbets,Everytime I see one of these posts I do the math on how much my 800 shares would be worth and my head starts spinning
2021-06-29 13:54:42,wallstreetbets,Same I just buy shares
2021-06-29 13:36:44,wallstreetbets,"Same, but also I'm trying to get to the point where I can even afford options haha."
2021-06-29 14:10:10,wallstreetbets,"not on AMC, the real play"
2021-06-29 09:38:06,wallstreetbets,🌙
2021-06-29 08:29:13,wallstreetbets,And beyond
2021-06-29 08:48:17,wallstreetbets,Its good to see! Wkhs is a solid play short term for the squeeze and long term because of the evs and drone tech
2021-06-29 08:54:48,wallstreetbets,"$WKHS, just add volume and watch it grow"
2021-06-29 18:26:20,wallstreetbets,"Im taking this as iron clad financial advice, have sold the house and the wife. WKHS to the moon baybay"
2021-06-29 10:19:31,wallstreetbets,I believe it is shorts buying shares and then doing a selloff to manipulate the price and make it appear to be dropping. They normally buy a huge amount of shares at market close then sell in morning to drive new investors away
2021-06-29 08:59:17,wallstreetbets,Buy and hold WKHS. Target 100-200-400$
2021-06-29 09:08:05,wallstreetbets,Hopefully sooner than 2030
2021-06-29 11:10:02,wallstreetbets,"Especially on a tuesday. wed/thurs ganna rip. Daily BB breaking out of the top, MACD rising, CCI and RSI verging up, if we close >17.40 today that's game, blouses  


Imma go take a shit"
2021-06-29 12:00:24,wallstreetbets,Lunch break. Volume is low and bearish rn. Hopefully this 🐎 ain't no donkey
2021-06-29 13:20:35,wallstreetbets,💯
2021-06-29 15:53:59,wallstreetbets,I am already holding 7500 shares..oh wait you were talking price. At this point I would be happy with 20
2021-06-29 08:39:52,wallstreetbets,"Today hopefully yes, but this $WKHS is just warming up. She's going to run $100+ according to many apes"
2021-06-29 08:07:03,wallstreetbets,I want what you are smoking
2021-06-29 16:04:25,wallstreetbets,Hail the horse!!! WKHS 💎🙌🌙🚀🐴
2021-06-29 08:36:04,wallstreetbets,Explain yourself
2021-06-29 12:49:47,wallstreetbets,"WKHS for sure. Once it breaks thru $18, sky's the limit. And it's too close to $18 now for people to bail. We got a lot of lovely holders who know what's up"
2021-06-29 12:49:05,wallstreetbets,I got 1k and 6.5k I need to get back what’s the move?
2021-06-29 12:59:43,wallstreetbets,sell kidney
2021-06-29 17:27:37,wallstreetbets,Got out and moved to BB. Short term might make a break but long term it’s gonna go up regardless when ivy hits in feb. not advice but you could see some money if you did the same
2021-06-29 18:35:47,wallstreetbets,"Holding too, its a rather serious meme stock compared to others Id say."
2021-06-29 19:38:19,wallstreetbets,Still holding. Even though down today I liked that it was on low volume.
2021-06-29 17:40:53,wallstreetbets,I'm long on it. Clean energy is only going to become more and more useful.
2021-06-29 19:39:51,wallstreetbets,21600 shares in early all but 2000 shares I picked at ten from calls and sitting on 7/16c 10.  I am long on this play this company has a future not just a pumpndump
2021-06-29 17:27:25,wallstreetbets,Holding CLNE shows you're playing chess ♟ not checkers 🤡
2021-06-29 17:41:43,wallstreetbets,"Yup, still holding.😎"
2021-06-29 17:25:10,wallstreetbets,I think its a solid long term play. I plan to get back in eventually. Wkhs and gsat have my attention for now
2021-06-29 17:26:43,wallstreetbets,"Well, you could've bought PLAY weeklies like me and gotten even more boned. At least still got BB positions to give me hope...

True autist"
2021-06-29 17:38:37,wallstreetbets,"Well, you could have thrown in $ on PLAY FDs like me and gotten completely wrecked. At least I still have some hope with my BB position...FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF"
2021-06-29 09:55:03,wallstreetbets,This is why I support whaling
2021-06-29 12:31:54,wallstreetbets,Totally fair. I dropped my BB positions by 50% for a loss. Been making it up elsewhere but still holding what’s left for the long play.
2021-06-29 09:17:43,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-06-29 10:54:07,wallstreetbets,"time to triple down, i averaged down from 16 to 14"
2021-06-29 10:51:12,wallstreetbets,"I assume u weren’t here for the initial bb run up around Jan this year, watching it bleed to $8 was soul crushing for many"
2021-06-29 11:09:17,wallstreetbets,Buy high sell low 🦧🦧🦧
2021-06-29 12:48:05,wallstreetbets,I bought 300 at $16 myself. Been holding these bags for a while now
2021-06-29 11:38:19,wallstreetbets,This could get wild again like a few weeks ago
2021-06-29 15:27:31,wallstreetbets,What strike do you favor?
2021-06-29 08:28:55,wallstreetbets,I would definitely vote for you for presidency. Keep spreading the word good sire. WKHS
2021-06-29 13:51:48,wallstreetbets,I'm not sure why this made me laugh so much but thank you if I wasn't a reddit poor I'd give you something
2021-06-29 12:33:49,wallstreetbets,Nothing at all. Just hold and hold and hold
2021-06-29 10:39:59,wallstreetbets,"Once we get past $60, it's on!"
2021-06-29 13:52:47,wallstreetbets,None of my stocks do bad if I just hold my phone upside down
2021-06-29 17:16:49,wallstreetbets,If you had $BA the drop never stops
2021-06-29 17:22:33,wallstreetbets,"it's the banner following of pump and dumps, followed by paperhands selling"
2021-06-29 16:41:41,wallstreetbets,Brutal day for a shit ton of stocks
2021-06-29 16:42:16,wallstreetbets,Perhaps good days are ahead that's why it is cleansing weak hand
2021-06-29 09:32:58,wallstreetbets,*70
2021-06-29 11:28:16,wallstreetbets,"Do you think shorties give up without a fight?  
If the information is correct, there are no more stonks to borrow to shorting. We are under attack with the last of their reserves. The tide turns bro."
2021-06-29 14:46:49,wallstreetbets,Who’s Gary Gensler? -some paperhanded little bitch
2021-06-29 15:44:06,wallstreetbets,You could be going to the movies in a red Lambo by Xmas 🎅
2021-06-29 12:33:02,wallstreetbets,Pepperidge Farms remembers.
2021-06-29 13:47:01,wallstreetbets,"Only 17% short interest, positions started over $60, highly liquid, no new buyers at this price, there is a 0% chance of a squeeze for AMC"
2021-06-29 13:53:53,wallstreetbets,"You know, smart shorters want the price to go higher, so they profit from $100 -> $5 or $200 -> $5 rather than only $57 -> $5"
2021-06-29 18:49:56,wallstreetbets,Jeff Bezos been awful quiet since we starting buying up $WISH😈

2021-06-29 08:56:52,wallstreetbets,It's run by an API that aggregates the top mentions... you retard :)
2021-06-29 11:01:12,wallstreetbets,Still bullish on CLNE personally
2021-06-29 16:37:05,wallstreetbets,WF's BF will be proud... you're doing good work here.
2021-06-29 16:58:13,wallstreetbets,Post proof unless you a yellow bellied chicken shit
2021-06-29 18:59:29,wallstreetbets,This will happen. Gay fucks probably already sold. Haters
2021-06-29 09:12:38,wallstreetbets,Proof.
2021-06-29 13:41:54,wallstreetbets,Same….. but it would be nice to see it do something other than trade vertical.  Fucking dip so I can buy more or start climbing already. Waiting is fucking boring
2021-06-29 14:40:56,wallstreetbets,Lmao right? Gets listed and dead
2021-06-29 14:38:58,wallstreetbets,Didn't you here there was a Bag Alert? Major bag alert
2021-06-29 12:13:53,wallstreetbets,"Lmao.

It won't squeeze 🤣"
2021-06-29 09:03:36,wallstreetbets,Because it's manipulative. In BB we trust!
2021-06-29 11:46:44,wallstreetbets,It’s tanking..?
2021-06-29 15:08:06,wallstreetbets,Those rockets are pointing the wrong direction for this ticker it seems
2021-06-29 10:16:30,wallstreetbets,CLNE and BB for me 🚀
2021-06-29 10:46:08,wallstreetbets,"Wish cline would go
Above 11. These bags are heavyyyy!!"
2021-06-29 09:49:59,wallstreetbets,"You're not missing anything. There was never a big catalyst in view at anytime. 
There was chatter about partnerships with starlink and good business fundamentals. It was never a WSB bet. It was a long term position."
2021-06-29 09:53:14,wallstreetbets,The facebook patent sale could be a big catalist.
2021-06-29 08:41:51,wallstreetbets,Don't you mean $600? 📈
2021-06-29 12:55:49,wallstreetbets,Let’s go! Finally in the green today
2021-06-29 12:12:45,wallstreetbets,I just have plan A. My plan B is making better decisions next time.

2021-06-29 08:38:29,wallstreetbets,"Just seems fishy is all. Just have a bad feeling about the thread that it groups tickers like this. Like it's scraping wsb to find what's talked about, plasters it on the front page for possible P&D? *adjusts tin foil hat*"

2021-06-29 15:30:50,wallstreetbets,Selling around the 14 and 15 strikes on green days have been free cash flow for a while now. Premiums aren't crazy high but they add up really fast.

2021-06-29 14:06:58,wallstreetbets,"Any links to that info? Clearly I could Google it, but a quick access to it would be highly beneficial (and lend some much needed validity to your comment).     

Between this new system they have in place where shorts must be reported (weekly?) and an alleged rule in place by the SEC stating the liquidation of  assets to cover shorts that must be closed will be automatically handled by software, meaning there’s no way to avoid covering these shorts, I’d say AMC is in one hell of a position to squeeze. So, someone tell me one legal reason why it isn’t."
2021-06-29 13:54:36,wallstreetbets,"Short interest is at is 19.8% , even if they “started over” they had to buy back their old positions to cover, plus whatever new positions they have opened. 0% is cute, I’ll be back in a couple weeks. Remindme! 3 weeks"

Trading has always been something I’ve been interested in, I’ve just never had the capital to actually invest until recently. Poor family blue collar background and all. 

Just really hard to find genuine good resources that aren’t just a bunch of “cross your fingers”. Really wanting to invest in learning how these speculations occur and are actually right. “How to tell if a stock is truly undervalued” kind of ordeal. Oh well, C’est la vie"
2021-06-29 11:43:52,wallstreetbets,"And that lowers the CB? And if they want to exercise the shares, they pay $14x100 to you, correct?"

2021-06-29 16:09:20,wallstreetbets,I just need a lil clne fuel in my bb rocket to get over the red candle to take a bite of green. Cheers mate.

2021-06-29 14:18:16,wallstreetbets,Really? you don't even know the basics about AMC? Do you even know the market cap is 15 times higher then back when the company was profitable and before it took on billions of debt?
2021-06-29 13:57:24,wallstreetbets,"No idiot hedge fund would buy back old positions then start new ones. They're either new hedge funds or the old ones are getting better deals (i.e. cover at $51, short at $61, repeat)"

2021-06-29 12:01:05,wallstreetbets,Exactly or you can think of it as getting paid for having an active limit sell order but if it doesn’t reach that price you still get paid the premium and you keep doing this based on your risk tolerance.

2021-06-29 15:37:26,wallstreetbets,Volume is still pretty good. I mean the fact is “higher” lows seem to be established each day. All good things.
2021-06-29 14:21:04,wallstreetbets,the floor gets steadily higher though. it seems like under 50 promotes buying pressure and above 60 is when they really short hard. some where above $65 is a margin call they don't want to see. I think this is just their last chance efforts
2021-06-29 14:19:38,wallstreetbets,Do you have have dick in your brain ? 😂
2021-06-29 14:18:02,wallstreetbets,Well... The ratio is worse for BB and GME.. Is this really an indication of imminent collapse?

2021-06-29 11:50:00,wallstreetbets,Good point. What’s your cost basis?
2021-06-29 12:01:42,wallstreetbets,"So ignorant after 5 months?

We knew Cohen was getting into the game, we knew he pivoted chewy to an online retailer, we knew he was going to do that for gme.  You need more than a high short interest, you also need a catalyst to raise the stock price and keep it high such as having a new chairman of the board."

2021-06-29 14:20:12,wallstreetbets,Considering all the free money apes donated to AMC the stock might only fall to $6

2021-06-29 12:04:50,wallstreetbets,GME and AMC are about the dumbest possible buys based on anything resembling fundamentals. There's a reason we're called retards. It a mob driven short squeeze that caught big players with their pants down.
2021-06-29 17:16:31,wallstreetbets,"That’s something I’ve been trying to hone in on lately as well is option trading. It seems far more risky, overall. But higher risk equals greater reward"
2021-06-29 08:30:51,wallstreetbets,I like your move; i didnt sell for the 10k profit when it was up near 20 during last little spike.. will be a bit harder for me not too when it breaks 30 but i still feel like this is going to 50 in the next year so just going to be patient and hold and if i see it back near 10/11 range ill be tempted to increase my posistion
2021-06-29 14:23:14,wallstreetbets,Oh you mean all that free money that got eaten in 5 min candle sticks 🤡 once again I’ll be here in a few weeks ladies 🦍

2021-06-29 08:36:35,wallstreetbets,It’s a power play gotta have big BBalls to not sell when you get 10k profit. But like you I’m confident in BB enough so that I can wait until it reaches its full potential
2021-06-29 12:20:40,wallstreetbets,Thank you!

2021-06-29 09:06:45,wallstreetbets,Idk 228% is 228%. What are you a Russian bot?
2021-06-29 09:20:27,wallstreetbets,I'm a human with eyes.  zoom out on the chart.  VIAC has already been to Pluto and back.  you're picking up pennies in front of a train.
2021-06-29 11:20:54,wallstreetbets,"Every chart out there will look like “a year late” because every stock went through a covid dip and recovery. New days ahead - it was easy last year, VIAC is great value with high upside"
2021-06-29 09:27:45,wallstreetbets,Let him then if it’s working for him lol
2021-06-29 11:58:36,wallstreetbets,"Really?  Equities went up because of Covid related recoveries?  No fucking way!

I haven’t been living under a rock. If you think VIAC is gonna randomly pump back to it’s pre-crash high or even 75% of that high, you’re delusional. 

VIAC pumped on post election DIA rotation, retail fomo, but above all else, Archegos gamma squeezing. November - March was the outlier, not the norm. Maybe it’s trading at a discount, but not more than 10%-20%. 

It’s great OP has a 2 bagger, but to think you’re gonna get 10% above the current channel by expiration is nonsense"
2021-06-29 12:29:02,wallstreetbets,"Agree to disagree, but yea I’d rather hold stock than calls. Archegos guy was more unlucky than dumb; Viacom equity offered at ~$80 while the stock was 100 and it imploded his positions. Back of envelope it’s ~ 10 p/e with growth prospects, it has a little wsb heat and it’s pays 2% dividend while you wait"

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"How to DD/Analyse a Stock  Aight blokes gather around. If youre sick of getting Motley Fooled give this a crack

This is how I DD a stock, so hopefully, new investors won't get fooled into pump-and-dumps. There's obviously a lot of ways to do your due diligence on a stock, I think the most important thing is having a process and not relying on trash articles, or your mates tips :|

My Stock DD Checklist Summary

Are you sick of getting *Fooled* into terrible stocks? Stock DD or Due Diligence is probs the most important step in investing. So do your DD and don't COP a Pump and Dump.

**Step One: Identify the Stonk**

The first step to a stock DD is obviously finding a stonk to DD. This could be a recommendation from your dodgy mate, or maybe you got Motley *Fooled* *.* The important thing to note here is the intent of the source that is mentioning the stock. Do they have a vested interest? Are they tryna pull a Jordan Belford on ya? What is their motive behind mentioning the stock?

For these reasons, it may be a good idea to identify your own stock. Have a think about companies that you interact with and see if they are publicly traded. Or browse through the listings. Although these strategies are honestly slow and probs trash you can be sure there’s no altera motive.

**Step Two: Understand the Company. Know the Stonk**

This is an extension on the phrase don’t invest in something you don’t understand. The same goes for individual stocks, it’s probably not a good idea to invest in a company if you don’t even know what they do PROBABLY?

1. Search the Businesses ‘About Us’ Section

Pretty much all listed companies will have a webpage with an ‘about us’ section browsing this and their website can be a good starting point to understanding their business, and a good start to a stock DD. See if their website is trash while ur there.

2. Use Simply wall st and Read the Company Profile

SWS is decent for listed stocks, it has a Company Overview section for every stock which gives a quick synopsis (Synopsis: a bRiEf suMmaRy oR gEneRal SurVEy Of SoMEThinG) about the business and what they do.

How Much Do I Need To know?

Peter Lynch “Never invest in an idea you can’t illustrate with a crayon.” As a starting point you should be able to answer at least these four questions, and probs be able to use a crayon;

1. What sector is the company in?
2. What does the company do?
3. How does the company make money?
4. How long has the company been around?

**Step Three: What is their Market Cap**

A company’s market capitalization or (Market Cap: if you didn't know) is how much the stock market determines a company is worth. it is calculated by the total market value of all outstanding shares. These are Large, mid and small cap.

Each category can be a good investment strategy it's just important to note that each group has different companies at varying levels of maturity. You shouldn't buy a micro-cap and be surprised if it gets delisted instead of paying dividends. Likewise, you probably shouldn't buy a Bluechip and hope they go to the moon.

**Step Four: Screening Software for Stock Analysis**

There are a lot of websites and tools available to screen the selected stocks, Here's what i use:

**Trading View** great

**Yahoo Finance** ehhh

**Simply Wall St** decent, (lots of nice Pics if u cant read)

**What are we looking for?**

After picking some of these tools that works well for you, perform a basic fundamental analysis on the stock. Looking for any red flags:

**Earnings Per Share (EPS):** Positive? Growing over time? Earning?????

**Price to Earnings Ratio (PE):**

* PE 0/NA: *The company has no earnings*
* PE 1-14: *The company is undervalued/has low investor sentiment regarding growth*
* PE 15-20: *Average*
* PE 20+: *The company is overvalued/has high investor sentiment regarding growth*

**Book Value/share:** The book value is the net assets of a business divided by the number of shares on issue.

**Debt:** A company should have more assets than liabilities to avoid bankruptcy. We like companies with low-to-no debt. If a company has debt, ensure it is well covered by assets and earnings

**Return on Equity (ROE):**

Higher ROE = The better the company are at making money from equity and vice versa.

We like companies with consistently higher ROE over 10. A low ROE means low growth potential.

**Past Performance:** We all know 'past performance is not indicative of future returns' but it can pay to have a quick look at the stock chart. If its going up that means money

**Step Five: Financials**

find the companies latest Yearly or Half-Yearly report. Analyse its Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash flow statement.

**Step Six: Cap Raise! Dilution**

Therse nothing more frustrating than seeing your share getting hit with Cap Raise after Cap Raise and seeing your shares diluted to nothing. We all had that feeling when they halt and release another supplementary prospectus. FML. One easy sign that a company is constantly raising capital is through looking at it's share price and number of shares on issue. IF SP is rly low and number of shares is rly high then they're probs cap raising 24/7.

We can also use the financials we read before to try and predict if the company is adequately capitalised.

A capital raise is not necessarily a red flag, but be wary and sucks to see all those trading haults.

**Step Seven: Buy Sell Ratios and Volume**

See if there are a healthy number of buyers and sellers and decent trading volumes. The best way to do this is using your trading platforms. If you're wanting to sell there's got to be someone to buy the trash off you.

**Step Eight: Prospects**

When examining a company for your stock DD we should consider its macro and microeconomic factors. Notably regulation and future industry outlook and disruption. Are they gonna be the NExt Blockbuster? Is the gov gonna screw u over?

**Step Nine: Competition**

compare the stock to it's direct competitors. To do this we are going to go back to step four and compare the company's fundamentals against its competitors. If the competitors are better then why not buy them instead?

Do they have an economic moat?

\----------------------------------------------

***There are five types of generally accepted economic moat******s****;*

1. ***Low-cost production;***  *Companies that can keep their prices low can maintain market share and discourage competition*
2. ***High switching costs;*** *Customers and suppliers might be less likely to change companies or providers if the move will incur monetary costs, time delays, or extra effort. e.g. banks and power providers*
3. ***Network effects;***  *network effect happens when the “value of a good or service grows” as its used by existing and new customers e.g. Amazon is an excellent example*
4. ***Intangible assets;*** *Brand identity, patents, and government licenses are examples of intangible assets. e.g. think Nike or Coca-Cola as an excellent brand and think of the government regulation surrounding gamble and the moat this creates for gambling companies.*
5. ***Efficient scale.*** *Companies that have a natural monopoly – or operate in markets or industries where there are few rivals*

*One thing to consider about an economic moat is they’re largely priced into a stock share price as they often relate to profits. For example Coca-Cola has an excellent brand and due to that sells more products and creates more profits. As such these factors will often be indirectly accounted for in Quantitate Analysis but it can be helpful to identify businesses with and without these moats.*

\------------------------------------------------

**Step Ten: Insider Ownership and Management**

**Insider Ownership:** We generally like companies with large insider ownership. This is big for small cap companies. Skin in the game helps ensure the management's motives are in line with ours. U can use Simple wall St (Swear i dont work witt them, just like their stuff) which shows Insider Ownership and Trading easily. We like small cap stocks with \~30% insider ownership and history of owners buying on market. For large cap companies' insider ownership will be lower, 3-5% would be decent in this case. It wont be much for large caps u clearly wont see Bill G coppin 30% of Micros any time soon.

**Are management buying or selling large amounts of shares?** Sudden large selling by management for no apparent reason may hint that management believes the company is overvalued or peaked at that point in time.

**Management Experience:** Consider educational and professional backgrounds. One of the most important factors is their experience in the industry. Their reputation is also key. What goals has the management set out for the company? Have the leaders had successful projects in the past, or did they fail?

 One case study of management is the affect that Elon Musk has had on tesla.  

**Bonus Step: Speccies are Sentiment and Hype**

After going through every step and doing a thorough DD, it's important to mention that the market is unpredictable trash. Even with the most advanced analyses, speccies are just sentiment and hype. By every stretch of fundamental analysis, they are trash stonks, that doesn't mean you can't make money off them. Just be ready for the pump-and-dump!

(reposted w/ a bit more info. Also had to remove all the links to the SWS and trading and stuff bc the subreredit didnt like. I got nothign to do with them. I just like their stuff)

Cheers for reading blokes. Hoepfully this saves at least someone from getting Motely Fooled into trash

2021-06-29 16:16:38,wallstreetbets,"IMO - problem is that in this market unless you do EXTREMELY deep research into companies it will be very hard to truly understand them well enough to safely buy for a long time horizon.

The whole market is in a bubble from a fundamental perspective.  Some look fairly priced but a large correction looks VERY likely in the next 1-2 years.  So why not buy the same great companies but way cheaper by waiting?  

Even if it goes up 10% in that time frame, everything gets dragged down in a correction even good stocks and you take a risk without much gain."

2021-06-29 17:53:29,wallstreetbets,"The basis of it always it: understand what you’re putting your money into. This is by no means a fool proof get rich overnight technique. No one knows what the markets gonna do it’s a casino in the short term. But having a good DD strategy can help you weed out a lot of crap, and make sure you’re comfortable in your investments. The confidence can help your 💎 🙌 if the market does crash. At the end of the day trash stocks can still go to the moon. Just Do some research before throwing all your money at soemthing 
Idk about “bubble” I’m buying as per normal. Last time the market crashed I invest 5k a day ‘until the market recovers or I go broke’ like it recovered. But plan on doing the same thing if we crash again.

2021-06-29 11:20:00,wallstreetbets,"Post-caffeination here!  Should have clarified before, but clarification is a skill that eludes me at 5:30am. I did read the TL;DR, but was still planning to do a deep read regardless, which I have since done, as I am still but ankle-deep in learning to invest.

Nonetheless, even I, as the noob I am, already learned to disregard Motley Fool long ago. My news feed since I started reading anything stock related has been nothing but clickbait articles that all read the same and are clearly written from a template to get you to sign up for their shitty newsletter, where they push random pump and dumps.

""Top 3 Stocks that you can ______ for ______ Blah blah blah blah (Shill stock) seems poised to (Insert overpromise of return) blah blah blah repeat for 2 additional stocks blah blah blah....

BUT WAIT! **Should you invest $1000 in (Shill stock) right now?**

Before you consider (Shill stock) you'll want to hear this! *Our award winning analyst team JUST revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy, and none of the stocks we mentioned was one of them*! Sign up for our newsletter right now for exclusive access and get the insider scoop on the next hot stock!""

2021-06-29 06:06:57,wallstreetbets,Ok. Mods I do think you probably need to look at those bots or check the figures. The daily thread was spammed with loads of other tickers yesterday that should be here and not in the daily. Unless it’s filtering out spam comments from new accounts or something.
2021-06-29 06:59:45,wallstreetbets,What is with the tickers
2021-06-29 07:02:39,wallstreetbets,Is Uwmc the biggest letdown ever? I mean I imagine one day it’ll finally get it’s day but holy shit is this stock going nowhere fast.

It’s a great company to get into rt now at a low price. Sure there are others that might be better in it’s field, but once this thing gets an FDA approval, it’s 🚀🚀🌝 🦍

SENS why to buy
 Skip to end to see summary 
Catalyst 

SENS CGM system has been remodeled and improved to last 180 days, and is awaiting approval from the FDA. The chances of it being approved are high considering that it’s already being used In Europe. Keep in mind America makes up about 96% of the market share. Due to Covid-19 the approval was pushed back and is thought to be some time around the middle of this year.

This has caught the eye of institutional buyers as 25% of the stock and 50% of the float is held by institutional buyers. Recently, H.C. Wainwright agreed to buy about 25,974,026 shares at 1.925 per share. Within days the same Hedge Fund agreed to increase the magnitude of their purchase to 51,948,052 shares at the same price. The total value of the purchase is exactly 100 million dollars. Then on January 21st, it was bought deal valuing the total purchase at 115 million

SENS has 14 patents all relating to the design and specific parts of their CGM system

The way a normal CGM system works is a tiny sensor with a needle is inserted under your skin and then it measures your glucose levels while lasting up to 7-14 days. Twice a day you need to check the CGM system itself by pricking your finger and inserting a drop of blood. You also need to replace the CGM sensor every 3-7 days which requires you to remove the entire device. 

The Percentage of Americans with type 1 diabetes that use a CGM is now on an exponential growth curve rising from 12% in 2014 to 24% in 2016 to 38% in 2018 

The general market concentration has about 4 major players
Dexcom, Abbott, Medtronic, and Senseonics. So this market is extremely concentrated

Out of all the other companies that are solely devoted to the design and manufacturing of CgM devices there are 26 competitors , however Senseonics has received the most funding at 143.4 million.

Also the main subject behind the majority of their patents is analytical chemistry, analytical chemistry is the science of obtaining, processing, and communicating information about the composition and structure of matter. In other words, it is the art and science of determining what matter is and how much of it exists.

And while yes this field is being used to separate and measure the glucose levels within the human Body, this field is very wide and offers a wide selection of possible futures, once revenue increases. 



Out of the past 4 quarters SENS has beat revenue expectations 3 times and beat EPS estimates twice.




Continuous Glucose Monitoring Market 

-Current market dynamics and growth opportunities
-Technological advances on the market 
-Strategies and different product innovations for major players 

Two things make up the CGM market, the components used and the geographical location of the company

-32.3 million Americans have type 2 diabetes
-Diabetics have a 300% increased risk of being hospitalized, thus increasing expenses or cautionary measures
-In developed countries close to 90% of type 1 diabetes patients use glucose meters, 50% of type 2 may also use glucose meters

With increasing awareness among the type 2 diabetes patients, demand for CGM devices has been rising at a rapid pace 

In 2016 there were about 321 million people with diabetes, by 2020 the number has increased about ten percent to 361 million. 

2017 Increased 2.18 percent 
2018 Increased 3.96 percent 
2019 Increased 2.93 percent 
2020 Increased 2.84 percent 



SENSORS
Eversense CGM System, an implantable glucose sensor by Senseonics Incorporated was launched in 2018. The advantage of Eversense CGM System is that it can remain in place for up to three months, where the other CGMs sensors remain in place for up to 3-10 days.

MARKET SEGMENT
Medical devices occupied 27.7% of the share in 2020

Between 2018 and 2020, Senseonic generated a meager $8.3 million in product revenue. It cannot manage to break even in terms of gross margin. Since its inception in 1996, the company has lost $648.5 million. Before its $175 million equity infusion in Q1 2021, the company had just $35.9 million in assets to offset $177.2 million in liabilities.
Possible downsides: 
Its peers, such as Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT), Dexcom, and Medtronic (NYSE: MDT), are all better capitalized and farther ahead in their technology. By the time Senseonic launches Eversense 365, its competitors will likely have moved on to seventh or eighth-generation CGMs. It's typically not a good idea to go long on stocks of a healthcare company that can only play catch-up. 


Summary: As an investor I typically like to follow Socially Responsible Investing/ Value Investing. Looking at the companies free cash flow/ ebitda ratio shows that they are in a good position to grow, along with pending FDA approval for their 180 day CGM device. Also considering majority of diabetics have said they would prefer this over the dexcomm CGM device it shows promise. Overall I believe SENS can have great enterprise value and wouldn’t be surprised to see it trading around 30 dollars EOY. 


Disclaimer: Normally I Buy a stock within 10-15% of a 52 week low that’s shown itself to offer some price support. If in this case it breaks to a new low, cut losses.
Also look into rare birds, asset plays, to a lesser extent, arbitrage opportunities and companies selling at less than two thirds of net value (net working capital less liabilities). So I am breaking my usual buying pattern.
I am also buying an additional 50,000 shares, currently holding 10,000"
2021-06-29 06:15:40,wallstreetbets,it's a wasted spot that other shitty ticker could be using and not pollute other threads (although at this point there are too many of those)
2021-06-29 07:02:42,wallstreetbets,And the 1:4 split coming up usually drives the price pretty high
2021-06-29 06:19:25,wallstreetbets,I’m just explaining why AMD is being mentioned enough to be included in this thread.
2021-06-29 07:06:00,wallstreetbets,You know it’s all time high is just over $13 right? I like the company and think they have potential but just throw out a random number like $30 seems a little silly
2021-06-29 06:57:02,wallstreetbets,Need a +20% day!
2021-06-29 07:45:11,wallstreetbets,"Hey zjz dawg, can you check out my previous comment in this thread if you haven't already?!

Thanks!"
2021-06-29 07:16:00,wallstreetbets,It hasnt had its move yet. Be patient
2021-06-29 07:15:22,wallstreetbets,Still is lol
2021-06-29 06:17:22,wallstreetbets,This isn’t a “shitty ticker quarantine” thread. It’s for the 3 most mentioned tickers. That’s it.
2021-06-29 07:16:53,wallstreetbets,"Oh... she has legs and she is running. I expect a dip as people cash in profits who were just on to make a quick buck. After that and the split, I see it making a run like other tech stocks to higher numbers. Potentially 300-400 after the split, but I don't know how long it will take to get there. I'm an NVDA whore and own stock. Aside from a macroeconomic event which will probably hurt all stocks.... I see it as a safe place to park my money. In fact, I read where lots of analysts see it as a safe place for any future crash. That last Friday when the dow dipped 500 points, nvda was flat."
2021-06-29 06:24:05,wallstreetbets,Saw some other popular bots without AMD listed. I really havent seen too many people talking AMD across a lot of subreddits.
2021-06-29 07:37:46,wallstreetbets,$14-15 would be really nice in the next couple of weeks
2021-06-29 07:14:58,wallstreetbets,I assumed 30 was a lowball
2021-06-29 07:13:45,wallstreetbets,Not random
2021-06-29 07:14:30,wallstreetbets,Look at CLOV chart? Still think it cant happen?
2021-06-29 07:20:56,wallstreetbets,sure it is
2021-06-29 06:25:30,wallstreetbets,"…what? What “other popular bots”? Who gives a shit about other subreddits? 

Personally I’ve been on AMD for over a month and I know many others on this sub also are, in anticipation for the next few weeks."
2021-06-29 06:29:27,wallstreetbets,"By that logic, who gives a shit about this bot or sub. Judging by the comments, not many. Just saying, I scan all over and AMD is pretty quiet. Maybe the bot is hoping to change that."
2021-06-29 06:31:28,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been seeing AMD regularly mentioned more and more for the past week on the daily thread. 

My AMD options printed 20% gains just yesterday. 

It’s definitely being talked about.

Not everything is a conspiracy."
2021-06-29 06:35:37,wallstreetbets,"Not saying its a conspiracy. Just saying I'm boggled. Will keep an eye on AMD more I guess. You must have options. Their gains seem small when I see nvda up $150 in a month. Either way, I'm seeing higher gains on other, similar stocks."
2021-06-29 06:49:22,wallstreetbets,"Nvda Is  already ATH, AMD have a price target of 110 Better potential upside"
2021-06-29 07:10:46,wallstreetbets,"You're an idiot. Nvda has a new target of 900. Tell me again about better potential upside? The real difference is AMD is more affordable. $85 vs $800. But keep voting me down, doesn't make you anymore right lol."
2021-06-29 07:12:09,wallstreetbets,">Nvda Is  already ATH, AMD have a price target of 110 Better potential upside

lol, you are the first I've seen claim this. nVidia is acquiring ARM which will give them massive inroads to mobile chipsets. They really are on a moon trajectory."

Let’s say theoretically SPCE starts sending up tourists tomorrow? What could they handle 20 tourists before the EOY roughly 3 more flights? Or could they handle more? Let’s say theoretically they could send 100, roughly 17 flights? Would these numbers justify their stock price? 100 passengers: 100x250k= 25 million. Where is all the revenue going to come from to justify these prices?"

After a gentle alien becomes stranded on Earth, the being is discovered and befriended by a young boy named Elliott (Henry Thomas). Bringing the extraterrestrial into his suburban California house, Elliott introduces E.T., as the alien is dubbed, to his brother and his little sister, Gertie (Drew Barrymore), and the children decide to keep its existence a secret.

Eventually stock goes brrrr and you're golden.

Did you know that Boeing has a **4,041 order backlog** for its planes? That is around **$800 BILLION** in revenue already locked in!

They can easily deliver over 800 planes per year. 

If you add service and educational contracts that's easily over $1 Trillion in revenue for Boeing already guaranteed. 

Boeing is a $300 stock even if they get 0 orders for planes for 5 years. This is no yolo play this is a solid boomer retirement juggernaut.

2021-06-29 14:02:42,wallstreetbets,"My guess on SOFI

The more sophisticated short sellers made a good return from open today and covering during the early afternoon spike that caused the spike in IV. Other late running short sellers are currently holding at or near 19.26, but are now in a riskier position because whoever the morning party was is now in a position to go long for a run up during power hour. I think that the possibility of a run up near close is more likely than not."

SOFI has gone from 20-24 multiple times back and forth the past month. This is standard behavior for the stock. With all the attention its getting it will certainly climb back to 24. This is why you should also buy options with atleast 2-3 weeks til expiration. If you want immediate gratification go to the blackjack table."

HOME is pegged to $37 right now, but if the big investor convinces shareholders to fail the vote, it'll jump since rejecting the deal will be very bullish. Options are risky but insanely cheap (Dec $37 only $0.25, August $0.15), shares are virtually zero risk (36.87 -> $37 if the deal occurs.) And you can vote against the acquisition."

2021-06-29 12:15:48,wallstreetbets,My portfolio was grossly overweight. I was a criminal defense attorney representing some of the biggest scum in my area and getting rich while doing it. Then one night after a party I was driving down the road getting blown by a high class escort. Distracted by the blow job I ran over an old gypsy woman. I was able to wiggle out of charges by rightly pointing out she was jaywalking. After that her husband ran up to me. He said some mumbo jumbo but I distinctly remember him calling me white man from town and mentioned WSB. Since then my portfolio has been in shambles.

**SENS DD by @literatureNo2985 *8days**

SENS why to buy
 Skip to end to see summary 
Catalyst 

SENS CGM system has been remodeled and improved to last 180 days, and is awaiting approval from the FDA. The chances of it being approved are high considering that it’s already being used In Europe. Keep in mind America makes up about 96% of the market share. Due to Covid-19 the approval was pushed back and is thought to be some time around the middle of this year.

This has caught the eye of institutional buyers as 25% of the stock and 50% of the float is held by institutional buyers. Recently, H.C. Wainwright agreed to buy about 25,974,026 shares at 1.925 per share. Within days the same Hedge Fund agreed to increase the magnitude of their purchase to 51,948,052 shares at the same price. The total value of the purchase is exactly 100 million dollars. Then on January 21st, it was bought deal valuing the total purchase at 115 million

SENS has 14 patents all relating to the design and specific parts of their CGM system

The way a normal CGM system works is a tiny sensor with a needle is inserted under your skin and then it measures your glucose levels while lasting up to 7-14 days. Twice a day you need to check the CGM system itself by pricking your finger and inserting a drop of blood. You also need to replace the CGM sensor every 3-7 days which requires you to remove the entire device. 

The Percentage of Americans with type 1 diabetes that use a CGM is now on an exponential growth curve rising from 12% in 2014 to 24% in 2016 to 38% in 2018 

The general market concentration has about 4 major players
Dexcom, Abbott, Medtronic, and Senseonics. So this market is extremely concentrated

Out of all the other companies that are solely devoted to the design and manufacturing of CgM devices there are 26 competitors , however Senseonics has received the most funding at 143.4 million.

Also the main subject behind the majority of their patents is analytical chemistry, analytical chemistry is the science of obtaining, processing, and communicating information about the composition and structure of matter. In other words, it is the art and science of determining what matter is and how much of it exists.

And while yes this field is being used to separate and measure the glucose levels within the human Body, this field is very wide and offers a wide selection of possible futures, once revenue increases. 



Out of the past 4 quarters SENS has beat revenue expectations 3 times and beat EPS estimates twice.




Continuous Glucose Monitoring Market 

-Current market dynamics and growth opportunities
-Technological advances on the market 
-Strategies and different product innovations for major players 

Two things make up the CGM market, the components used and the geographical location of the company 


MARKET DRIVERS

Surge in diabetic population
-205.47 million people suffer from diabetes in China and India
-20 million had type 1 diabetes
****
America:
-2.7 million Americans have type 1 diabetes 
-32.3 million Americans have type 2 diabetes
-Diabetics have a 300% increased risk of being hospitalized, thus increasing expenses or cautionary measures
-In developed countries close to 90% of type 1 diabetes patients use glucose meters, 50% of type 2 may also use glucose meters

With increasing awareness among the type 2 diabetes patients, demand for CGM devices has been rising at a rapid pace 

In 2016 there were about 321 million people with diabetes, by 2020 the number has increased about ten percent to 361 million. 

2017 Increased 2.18 percent 
2018 Increased 3.96 percent 
2019 Increased 2.93 percent 
2020 Increased 2.84 percent 



SENSORS
Eversense CGM System, an implantable glucose sensor by Senseonics Incorporated was launched in 2018. The advantage of Eversense CGM System is that it can remain in place for up to three months, where the other CGMs sensors remain in place for up to 3-10 days.

MARKET SEGMENT
Medical devices occupied 27.7% of the share in 2020

Between 2018 and 2020, Senseonic generated a meager $8.3 million in product revenue. It cannot manage to break even in terms of gross margin. Since its inception in 1996, the company has lost $648.5 million. Before its $175 million equity infusion in Q1 2021, the company had just $35.9 million in assets to offset $177.2 million in liabilities.
Possible downsides: 
Its peers, such as Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT), Dexcom, and Medtronic (NYSE: MDT), are all better capitalized and farther ahead in their technology. By the time Senseonic launches Eversense 365, its competitors will likely have moved on to seventh or eighth-generation CGMs. It's typically not a good idea to go long on stocks of a healthcare company that can only play catch-up. 


Summary: As an investor I typically like to follow Socially Responsible Investing/ Value Investing. Looking at the companies free cash flow/ ebitda ratio shows that they are in a good position to grow, along with pending FDA approval for their 180 day CGM device. Also considering majority of diabetics have said they would prefer this over the dexcomm CGM device it shows promise. Overall I believe SENS can have great enterprise value and wouldn’t be surprised to see it trading around 30 dollars EOY. 


Disclaimer: Normally I Buy a stock within 10-15% of a 52 week low that’s shown itself to offer some price support. If in this case it breaks to a new low, cut losses.
Also look into rare birds, asset plays, to a lesser extent, arbitrage opportunities and companies selling at less than two thirds of net value (net working capital less liabilities). So I am breaking my usual buying pattern.
I am also buying an additional 50,000 shares, currently holding 10,000"

The pandemic is basically over. people are getting happy again. The globalists know this and they know their power and control is being decreased. Expect the new delta variant and fears of lockdowns to be used as a tool to try and suppress growth. I say this because volatility is now the play. Straddles, VIX, strangles, etc.

This is not political opinion only observation and how it might impact the markets. I am not a financial advisor, but I did sleep with your wife’s boyfriend last night. I also identify as a female person of color. So you apes pretty much have to listen to me."

2021-06-29 10:47:30,wallstreetbets,"SPCE has at least 50% downside profit available. $500mm of cash and burning $250mm per year. Will need to raise another $300-$500mm or more within next 12 months, diluting shareholders and tanking stock. Will take 3-7 years to ramp to run-rate operations and will probably only make $150mm-$300mm per year AT THAT POINT! Price to sales of 3x would value the equity at $900mm vs the $12bn market cap currently. Huge execution risk to get to that point. This stock should drop by a factor of 12x, or $4-$5.

You all have contributed bullshit facts and analysis in order to deceive the common American investor. You made it plausible for thriving companies like Tesla, Amazon and Exon Mobil to take serious dives instead of a straight up trajectory. You are the reasons the market is down today........ You want us to buy retail, oil, financials, pharmaceuticals, and industrial stocks. We did and now we're being stripped naked,  bent over and dragged backwards through a corn field.

2021-06-29 06:28:42,wallstreetbets,This dump talk is CRAZY. It was just at $24.95 and it’s been over $20 since mid-May. It just got pushed down in expectation of the lockup expiration yesterday and the volume absorbed those shares (I think). There is no reason to sell - at least not under $22 or $23 if you just want out.
2021-06-29 13:42:42,wallstreetbets,Fuck it I was convinced so $2700 on it
2021-06-29 13:43:32,wallstreetbets,It could be both but that volume definitely says otherwise

2021-06-29 08:35:57,wallstreetbets,"Intel has the huge upside of being the only domestic fab that can produce modern process nodes. The Biden admin and the DoD at large have been yeeting money into supply-chain security - and since Intel has the only domestic fabs that can do sub 10nm at consumer scales, Intel is positioned to capitalize big on the push to bring chip manufacturing on-shore. 

I am reasonably confident the whole Intel 'promising to build more fabs' in the U.S. is related to this and to curry favor with the DoD.

Will be interesting to see how this plays out in the next 5-10 years or so. Definitely a long  play."

My opinion is 2021 is going to be a Great year. And with that attitude, it actually has been amazing.

Literally found the love of my life, and ever since things have been really good. I made $35,000 in 20 days. LOL on call options.

My company was just acquired by a revolutionary bad ass tech company, started by google founders, so I now have 3x the vacation time, a pay raise, a job title raise to supervisor…. I’m just extremely Grateful.

I’m not a rich person. I’m a hard working normal person. And 2020 was a horrible year for so many people.

I feel shocked and surprised, that my Decision, to literally say out loud and force myself and others around me that 2021 was going to be a great year, is actually starting to manifest itself. It’s unbelievable, actually.

So maybe there is something to…. “Putting a certain energy out there into the universe, and that energy manifesting into something real.”"

2021-06-29 07:13:08,wallstreetbets,"Yesterday was lockup expiration - quick sell off with big volume.  Appeared to have a big short interest, which probably was mostly 5% holders hedging their positions until lockup expiration.  Yesterday was a good chance to get in at a better price.  It's a good company with a great business model with good long term prospects.  I'm long and added some on the sell-off (kind of regret not adding more).  Just don't get caught up in the hype and $50 by the end of the week projections and I think it will work out.   Good luck"

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I bought NVDA after June 21. Am I retarded? So NVDA is doing a 4-1 split on 2021-07-20. I [read](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/its-not-too-late-to-take-advantage-of-nvidias-stock-split.-heres-why-2021-06-25) that

>Each shareholder of record as of June 21 will receive three additional shares of NVIDIA stock for each one they own.

and then

>What's missing from NVIDIA's press release is the ex-dividend date. Because the stock split is being initiated in the form of a stock dividend, the ex-dividend date governs which investors are eligible to receive the newly split shares. In this case, NVIDIA's stock split goes ex-dividend on July 19, according to a spokesperson for brokerage house Charles Schwab. 

I'm too retarded to understand this. Why are there two dates? 

I have some shares from the last year. I also bought some more a few days ago (after June 21st). What now?


EDIT: Thanks apes. I thought that I'm going to get those shares, but this weird-ass date made me doubt."

2021-06-29 06:30:59,wallstreetbets,"The 21st June is the record date. This basically means nothing for people thinking of buying shares, it's mostly an accounting formality.

The split date is 20th July. If you own shares any time up to close of trading on t he 19th July, your shares will be split. If you buy shares before or after the record date of 20th June, your shares will split.

Also for those extra retards who don't know what a split even is: For every 1 share you own, you'll recieve 3 more but the value of each share is worth less. Say for example you had 1 share at a value of $100 before the split. After the split you'd have 4 shares worth $25 each."
2021-06-29 07:26:58,wallstreetbets,Well you’re retarded regardless of what stocks you buy and when sooo …
2021-06-29 06:22:39,wallstreetbets,"Your shares of NVDA will quadruple, if you purchased those shares before the ex-dividend date. That’s it. Not rocket science. The total value of your shares will be the same. 

Example. You bought 1 share for $400. Now you will have 4 x $100. Exactly what TSLA and AAPL did earlier this year (or last year?)"

2021-06-29 07:40:19,wallstreetbets,"nVidia's share price is near $800. Relative to other stocks, it's pretty high. I understand a split will change share price and share count while holding the total value static.

What I don't understand is why a company would perform a split, or not perform a split. For example, why didn't nVidia perform a 1:2 split when the price was near $400, or 1:3 at $600, instead waiting until 1:4 $800? And, now,  why not 1:2 or 1:8?"
2021-06-29 06:01:10,wallstreetbets,"ELIRetarded pls

If I bought 1 share for $700. On the 20th, I will still have 1 share but worth ~$200?"
2021-06-29 08:29:55,wallstreetbets,The future is bright for the autists. The retards not so much.
2021-06-29 07:46:59,wallstreetbets,"I guess its what fits into that companies business strategy. The board of Nvidia probably feels like this is a good time to split the shares for whatever reason.

Splits are done to make their shares more accessible to a wider market. Lots of investors who don't want to shell out $700+ per share can buy in. It doesn't usually have anything to do with the fundementals of the company.

Companies can also decide not to do a split for the exact opposite reason. Berkshire Hathaway for example has never done a stock split becuase their strategy is a deep, long term investment. They want their investors to be high-net worth individuals, who put their money in after careful consideration and leave it in the company for years, or decades.

They don't want a load of low liquidity retail investors jumping in and out every 2 mins every time the share price dips a few %. Somewhat of an elitist way of doing it but that's their strategy, and thats why BKR.A shares are like $400,000 per share. They also offer B shares that cost $276/share, this was specifically done becuase the market demanded it, but Warren Buffet always wanted a high share price on BRK's shares, so he basically compromised and issued a load of B shares to be sold at a lower price. Their class B shares also have fewer voting rights than their class A shares."
2021-06-29 06:08:33,wallstreetbets,That guy is wrong. You will get your extra shares after the split
2021-06-29 06:34:54,wallstreetbets,"If you have 1 share worth $700 on the day of the split, youll recieve 3 more shares, totalling 4, but each share will be worth less ($175 per share)"

2021-06-29 07:51:43,wallstreetbets,"This is basically what I'd guessed. But, investors could always invest at a more granular level with fractional shares. And, this access argument was the only one I had based in numbers, not psychology.

I didn't state this because I thought, for sure, there was more to it than just this."
2021-06-29 15:50:12,wallstreetbets,If you bought after June’s date you WILL NOT.  🤡
2021-06-29 13:46:36,wallstreetbets,"If you own a fractional share - you don't own a share. You have no rights beyond your contractual rights with the broker and as far as the company are concerned that fractional share does not exist (to be specific, it does exist but it's owned by the broker who is giving you ""notional"" access to some part of the value of it).

On a personal level, if I cannot afford a full share of a stock, I won't buy it and I will always take cash in lieu of a fraction of a share.

On a business level, because fractional shares don't actually exist they are not factored into the business decision of how many shares to have in the float. NVidia want their share float to be more liquid so will split the shares allowing actual shares to change hands on the public exchange."
2021-06-29 07:55:40,wallstreetbets,"Remember not everyone can buy fractional shares. Some brokers just dont offer them at all.

My current broker (IG in the UK) doesn't offer fractionals. Some of the older more established ones won't.

And as you rightly say - there's a psycology to it as well, in that even if people have fractional shares availible to them, they might still subconciously chose full shares. I used to use a broker that offered fractionals and always bought as full shares."

ON is also increasing margins quickly. This quarter, its EBITDA margin was 23%. By the end of 2023, analysts expect it should rise to 31%. ON is extremely undervalued at these prices."

Did you know that Boeing has a **4,041 order backlog** for its planes? That is around **$800 BILLION** in revenue already locked in!

They can easily deliver over 800 planes per year. 

If you add service and educational contracts that's easily over $1 Trillion in revenue for Boeing already guaranteed. 

Boeing is a $300 stock even if they get 0 orders for planes for 5 years. This is no yolo play this is a solid boomer retirement juggernaut.

2021-06-29 08:33:59,wallstreetbets,"Honestly feels like Krispy Creme is a trap. 

What are the odds that, once again, the price will fly up in the pre market and early in the day when institutions are able to trade, and as soon as retail gets a chance to buy the share price will drop, initiating new members into the bag holding club.

Plus the fundementals look like shit. Not that fundementals matter, this is WSB after all."

2021-06-29 04:20:40,wallstreetbets,">Huge upset that was. France’s biggest downfall was hubris as they defended poorly in the last few mins. 

I think the team themselves and most fans will agree on this. 

For as long as I've watched football, the general consensus is that when you have a 2 goal cushion, your best bet is to set up defensively to preserve the lead, or push for another goal if you have the skill and talent to do so. I think France became overconfident as soon as they went 3-1 up and had too many lapses in judgement and gave the Swiss too much time on the ball. And the rest you can see unfold on the pitch.

You cannot however, forget how poor Mbappe was in front of goal the whole match. Poor technique and decision making throughout and with such low confidence, looked likely to miss his penalty with the pressure that was on him.

>Spain vs Croatia was insane too.

I am kinda pissed off that I chose not to watch the game. Thought it'd be a 1-0 / 2-0 stinker but I was horrifically wrong. 

>Supposedly a guy put a bet of €1.90 for both matches to end 3-3 and won €49k

Fuck me. Now that takes WSB mentality for a play like that. Would've been gambling YOLO of the year from a football POV."
2021-06-29 06:32:07,wallstreetbets,I do matched betting and those two games were pretty great (not as good as that though!). The bookies I was using for those games do an offer where if a team goes two goals ahead they will pay the bet out on that team as a winner regardless of if they win or not. With matched betting you place a bet for a team to win and also place a bet for them not to win (a lay bet). For both of those games I won both bets. I.e my back bet on Spain and France won and so did my bets against them!
2021-06-29 04:05:12,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure it was the most eventful day of football in a very long time.

Switzerland came 1-0 in the lead but then it became 1-1 1-2 and 1-3 for France. During the last minutes it became 2-3 and then in the 90th minute (Game lasts 90 minutes) the camera caught this Swiss man in emotional agony and disappointment over about to be eliminated from the tournament but then I think 50 seconds or 80 seconds later Switzerland make it 3-3 and the camera catches his reaction after that goal. The 3-3 meant 30 minutes over time and a penalty shoot out if no one scored in the over time.

&#x200B;

Switzerland eventually won the penalty shootout. Thus eliminating France from the tournament."

There has been alot of negativity surrounding Palantir, so I decided to post my experience 

Before I knew anything about WallStreetBets and the current revolution that is our stock market at the moment, I was voluntold to participate in a Division level event called War Fighter in early October. This event consists of a simulated campaign with a made up adversary (Russia..), in order to test the planning and execution capabilities of Battalion Command Teams and above. This sounds way cooler than it actually is. In reality it is a bunch of people crammed together in a stuffy tent with slow computers and unreliable internet.

A significant component to events like this is something called “Battle Tracking”. This consists of keeping track of your friendly unit’s location, enemy’s location, amount of munitions left, etc. This is already enough of a pain in the ass as it is, which is only made worse that traditionally all these pieces of information are being depicted by different systems. So to get a full picture you have to cycle through different programs, notes, and make phone calls before you can get a full assessment. When your superiors are demanding updates at that very moment, it can be difficult and frustrating being able to gather the most up to date information within the desired time frame.

This is where Palantir comes in. I initially had no idea why there where a bunch of civilian techies in the area we were working, and when they let us know they had a new program they wanted us to test, I mentally thought, “Oh great, another thing to keep track of”. After that they all installed Palantir onto our computers, and I have to say I was impressed. Now to fully grasp why I was impressed you have to understand that usually when the Army gives us a new program to work with, it looks like it came from the decade before us. The “Virtual Reality” trainers we use look like they were made by a freshman in intro to game design. It is really disappointing.

On a superficial level, Palantir is crisp and looks quite modern. This is then superseded by its actually functionality. From being able to share maps with self-made layers, to being able to track the current amount of critical munitions and vehicle types, to more impressively being able to talk with other older army programs so that friendly and enemy locations updated in real time. Palantir had all the makings for an all-in-one resource for intelligence gathering and battle tracking. There was significant optimism from Division level leaders to test integrating Palantir into our control nodes to see the limits of its capabilities. Now let me be clear, it wasn’t perfect by any means. But on the ground, in the middle of a Pandemic, we had Palantir technicians requesting constant feedback for improvements as well as giving us tutorials as needed. It has been one of the very few times in my career where it seemed like the technology was made around what we wanted and needed from it rather than us having to figure out how to use it and what it was even good for.

Palantir left me with a first great impression. My only regret then was not even considering the fact that the company was something I could buy into. My investment strategy is to play the long game and I intend to hold Palantir for the foreseeable future."

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GOLD Barrick about to launch off Would go into further details regarding GOLD (the company not just an ETF) but it will probably be TLDR. Based on relatively long, medium, and short time frames, GOLD is oversold and about the flip the page.  Recent drop creates a buy opportunity.

**IF** GOLD stock moved by -5% over five trading days, **THEN** over the next 21 trading days, GOLD stock moves an average of 1.5 percent, with a 52% probability of positive return over this period.

Consider two situations,

Case 1: Barrick Gold stock drops by -5% or more in a week

Case 2: Barrick Gold stock rises by 5% or more in a week

Is the average return for Barrick Gold stock higher over the subsequent month after Case 1 or Case 2?

GOLD stock **fares better after Case 2**, with an average return of 1.5% over the next month (21 trading days) under Case 1 (where the stock has just suffered a 5% loss over the previous week), versus, an average return of 2.6% for Case 2.

In comparison, the S&P 500 has an average return of 3.1% over the next 21 trading days under Case 1, and an average return of just 0.5% for Case 2 as detailed in our dashboard that details the **average return for the S&P 500 after a fall or rise**.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Technicals point to a major move in the stock ""soon""

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Nikola, Sir Issac Newton and being in the right place at the right time🍎🍏 TL:DR; More than just gravity connects the success of Sir Isaac Newton and (in the future) Nikola.

Thesis: Nikola is about to get bonked on the head by a falling apple and will capture part of the Infrastructure Plan and the USPS truck contract.
They have no real business started yet but sit poised at the forefront of a massive new industry.


I would like to attempt to draw some correlation between Sir Isaac Newton’s “discovery” of gravity and the concept of simply being at the forefront of the right thing at the right time. 
Back in the day, meaning several hundred years ago, all discoveries and inventions were really simple and could be discovered screwing around in one’s own backyard or basement. Why? Simple things were still being discovered.
Not unimportant, just simple.
These discoverers became giants in human history by noticing, documenting, making the easily discoverable at the right time: the idea is that they were carried onward by all the weight of what was the natural progression of their discovery. 



Fast forward to today. The greatest investment opportunities lie in companies that are at the forefront of major future industries, and will capture market share.



Everyone is well aware of the shortcomings of Nikola, namely their somewhat fraudulent lack of business; However, having no business means they can become whatever they want.


Nikola is going to shock the world by becoming one of the major hydrogen fuel infrastructure companies in the next couple of years.

They have no role to play in hydrogen infrastructure. This hydrogen “infrastructure” is a scam anyway. From a technical perspective it’s exceedingly challenging - if not impossible, from an environmental perspective it isn’t very green at all, and from a “what can this company actually do in the space” perspective, the answer is nothing but tell lies really. 

You’ve picked a dog with NKLA - but there are a lot of delusional bag holders out there and maybe you can make money off them. As for the science, Elon Musk has made numerous comments as to why hydrogen is a scam and measurably worse than battery technology - if you have an engineering background there’s a lot of good reasons to doubt the feasibility of hydrogen."

2021-06-29 03:06:16,wallstreetbets,"Your reason for investing in Nikola is that the government MIGHT throw money at them—without them having ever successfully produced anything—on the grounds that they put on an “eco-friendly vehicles” hat at a time when it is trendy to wear “eco-friendly vehicles” hats? 

Sounds solid.

As far as the Newton analogy goes: Newton was alive and making observations at a time when there was a jump in the collective conscious and people were suddenly amazed by all the things about the world they’d taken for granted instead of marveling at the implications of. Great observation! However, by your own argument, lots of other people were probably noticing stuff dropping and even talking about it with each other. 

Newton is the one history remembers because, while tons of people could make observations, very few could read, write and had the resources to sit around and write extensively about their observations and the conclusions said observations produced. Newton had skills and resources needed to actually DO something with the trend of his time.

Nikola does not have skills, as has been demonstrated by their inability to do anything at all with the resources they do have. Analogy wise, they are the peasants who cannot write. The aristocracy didn’t grant peasants parchments, quills, lodging and meals, just in case they happened to figure out how to write back in Newton’s day, and they’re not going to now. 

The government will give the money to someone who already has the SKILLS they need. Not just a “company” that can look around and go “I think eco-friendly is in right now, guys! Let’s put on eco-friendly hats so everyone knows we know about the trend!”"

Yes, hydrogen requires significant infrastructure investment. Yes, hydrogen is expensive to make. Know what else requires significant infrastructure investment? The electrical grid to support all those EVs. Know what else is expensive to make? Lithium ion batteries. 

What I’ve learned in my career is that science doesn’t really matter when people believe what they want to believe. And people with money are so fucking deluded into believing that they are smarter and righter than everyone else that they’ll throw their money behind whatever cockamamie scheme they believe in. Hydrogen is that cockamamie scheme for the time being. Long live hydrogen.

Edit: but fuck NKLA for sure, that company is a fraud and a joke, I wish I had nicer things to say about it, but even knowing some of the team that went from Romeo to NKLA…let’s just say I haven’t the faintest sense of confidence that they won’t fuck something up."

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"(QSI) Quantum-Si Could Be The Next Big Thing Background: Quantum-Si came to market through a SPAC. We all know SPACs got destroyed through March and are now starting to come back. Most SPACs are EV, clean energy, digital finance, etc. Usually start ups with little to no revenue, operating at a loss, or futuristic tech that will change the game if it’s true and not a scam. (Nikola) 

Quantum-Si fits this mold completely with what I said above so that’s the risk factor that comes with it but it’s a one of a kind stock on the market and for some reason people are not talking about it or getting that run up like CCIV, Quantumscape, Chargepoint, CLII, Proterra, etc. Given these are all EV plays this just seems to be a less diluted market with bigger ramifications if this executes. 

Quantum Si builds a single molecule detection system with their own semiconductors. Basically, think of this as the next CRISPR and helping develop tech and outsource it to other companies for research on genomics. We saw what happened with Intellia Theraputics and CRISPR today with Phase 1 results. 

Miss Woods just invested a lot of money in them in the last week but take that with a grain of salt we all know the kind of year ARK is having but does give some spotlight on this with saying it could be the future. 

Again, typical SPAC with a long way to go and grow but a unique opportunity with low share price and many catalysts moving forward."

All them see green, meanwhile **GME** paid off all LT debt on their balance sheet, increased revenue from last year same q, and raised like $1.5 billion to play with but they don’t go up.   

This market is nonsense.  Banks and MMs just want to leverage and sell volatility."
2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Big time retard move planned way ahead. AMZN put strategy I will start off by saying this is not financial advice and I don't give a fuck what happens to my money.

So we're all aware Jeff Bezos is heading to space on July 20th.

My plan is to buy the July 23rd expiry FD puts on July 19th. 

In the event that the Bezos bros go boom I'm gonna say AMZN will drop. 

I know this is dark but there is no way in hell this type of thing is ""priced in""

TL:DR
Casino Longshot betting on Jeff Bezos' death

TL:CR
 🎰 🚀💥⚰ 💰💰💰💰💰

**UPDATE: 
Looks like Richard Branson is rushing to beat Bezos into space over the July 4th weekend. Some things should not be rushed, space flight is one of those things. 

And for that reason I will also be buying FD puts on SPCE

2021-06-29 16:54:27,wallstreetbets,"I think a strangle on $SPCE is a better application of your logic here: 

* $AMZN isn't directly affected by success or failure here, especially since Bezos stepped down as CEO. I think you're less likely to see a huge valuation drop than maybe a little blip if he goes boom, but it would likely be short lived. 

* Blue Origin has a much better track record and engineering design than Virgin Galactic - no failures in like a dozen tests vs. several failures in like 3 tests for VG, including a fatality. New Shepard is an autonomous vehicle, Spaceship 2 needs to be hand flown by the pilot, which introduces a lot of room for error as seen by the fatal flight. 

* $SPCE is going to have insane volatility one way or another - I think the biggest concern is picking an expiry that factors in potential launch delays, which would probably result in a slight dip but not a crash. 

I'm going to be opening a 7/16 strangle on $SPCE (probably like 35p/60c) on Friday with a target movement of about 50% in the underlying. Best of luck to you and your degenerate bets 🍻"

2021-06-29 01:05:03,wallstreetbets,"I would maybe splurge on July 30th puts, more time for the stock price would just have to move in your direction by a few hundred dollars for your FD to be profitable.  You benefit from the news about the event, but also Amazon's future, also recovery of remains, maybe funeral, etc.

Sadly for you, I think the launch will be pretty safe and little risk, but who knows... maybe China has some space shenanigans planned.  So could be a sleeper bet.   What result would benefit China, I'm not really paying attention with that angle.  Amazon seems to be a good customer for their products."
2021-06-29 01:10:25,wallstreetbets,"this is basically the strategy of Cornwall Capital (In the Big Short they were renamed Brownfield Capital)

Their strategy was essentially putting bets on unlikely things to happen. You lose a little when it doesn't happen but you make a fuckton when it does.

A 25% dip isn't out of the question if on the very unlikely chance that the launch goes sideways 

Shit, puts for $2070 are going for $1 a contract. People have thrown away $100 on more than one roulette spin before and the pay off here is better than 35:1"
2021-06-29 01:10:43,wallstreetbets,Now that finally is a Wall Street Bet

Maybe buy some weekly FD instead.

Bezos has less influence on Amazon now a days..vs.... Tesla Elon Musk if he went poof I think Tesla would have far greater drop !

2021-06-29 11:47:41,wallstreetbets,As far as things that shouldn't be rushed regarding spaceflight. You should read into the Apollo 8 mission. Absolute insanity that thing made it to the Moon and back safely. Robert Kurson has a great book all about it and the people involved.

2021-06-29 12:10:21,wallstreetbets,"Bezos is doing something really stupid, so it is natural for people to bet against his survival.  NASA lost 2 crews out of 135 space shuttle launches, so that is a 1.48% likelihood of everyone dying in a space flight.  If Bezos dies, then Amazon will likely do a sudden dip and quick recovery, but the dip could be huge."

2021-06-29 13:49:20,wallstreetbets,I'm loving this post. But thinking SPCE will be the first retard move as there's no way Branson goes up this weekend. So I'm playing for the Daily Double on both SPCE and AMZN. Both should fizzle.
2021-06-29 13:54:29,wallstreetbets,"Branson's mission seems safer.  They've done a lot more tests than Blue Origin.  Had deaths from crashes too.  And a lot of safe flights since the last deaths.  Bezos mission is kind of a dice roll.  Blue Origin has flown only 10 times.  They haven't crashed but... You never know, watching spacex rockets blow up at random sometimes.  Virgin doesn't really do a conventional rocket blast off, they use a mothership and their space vehicle is like souped up fighter jet.  Seems pretty safe."
2021-06-29 14:09:37,wallstreetbets,Hasn’t bezos essentially retired?  And not the part of active amzn management anymore?  If he dies does it matter for the company?

Sure, the paper hands will dump some shares, but it would be stopped practically the same day by Amazon openly stating that they are sorry for the passing of their Founder, but they have some relentless shit to keep up on doing.

Amazon will treat Bezos’ passing, just like it treats the death of a worker in a fulfillment center... everyone will be forced to keep working or be fired, even being told to push the body out of the way."

On July 20th, Bezos will be going through a 12th House Jupiter transit.

A lot of astrologers treat 12th house as ""guardian angel""/unusual luck placements.

For example, Michael Jackson had this placement when he was supposed to be on top of one of the twin towers on 9/11. But he missed his flight because he slept in.

If something bad does happen that day, he will be protected from anything that might cause harm. I feel like I don't even have to pay attention to whatever else is going on in his chart just because 12th House Jupiter is such a crazy beneficial placement. Personally, I wouldn't bet against this placement, but this isn't financial advice.

\----------------------

If it makes you feel better, his sun and mercury are in the 4th house. This is the house of family and home, but it's also a house of endings. Your home is your final resting place. In addition to representing luck, Jupiter can also mean a journey and some people view death as the ultimate cosmic journey. Perhaps he finds himself home at space. But this interpretation feels like a huge stretch. 

He also is going through a 10th house Pluto transit. This might indicate that he is more hungry for power and sometimes that pursuit can lead to a downfall.

Again, I still think anything bad happening very unlikely."
2021-06-29 16:29:03,wallstreetbets,If he dies have fun getting investigated.
2021-06-29 16:31:22,wallstreetbets,what is FD?
2021-06-29 16:31:55,wallstreetbets,Morbid but F hilarious
2021-06-29 16:47:54,wallstreetbets,I thought of this a few weeks ago and forgot. I agree and thanks for the reminder
2021-06-29 16:52:13,wallstreetbets,"He is resigning as CEO two weeks before the flight, so it kind of IS priced in. Shame Blue Origin isn't publicly traded."
2021-06-29 17:06:00,wallstreetbets,This is actually a good Russian roulette play. Definitely only do with money you can afford to lose!! Also there is a 99% chance he won't die and will become the first person in space. Virgin Galactic is a much better play for most of us. Its popped 20 - 30% after every successful step so far and is still relatively cheap. If Richard Branson becomes the first person to experience commercial flight Elon will tweet about it and it will get huge press. That baby will pop atleast 50%+ easy. I'm definitely playing a few straddle strategies on that baby. Boom it drops 50% succeeds it pops 50% win-win.

2021-06-28 22:50:24,wallstreetbets,He doesn’t even run Amazon anymore. Calm down on the drugs…or do more I guess I don’t know.
2021-06-28 23:27:11,wallstreetbets,"I thought about this too, but the chances of him blowing up are probably pretty low.  Maybe 1%. And if he doesn't blow up you might as well have just burned that money.  


Amazon would definitely fall but probably not that much.  SPCE is already overvalued by a lot and pretty much any space tourism accident would sink it."

2021-06-28 23:53:13,wallstreetbets,I wholeheartedly agree with this retarded strategy.
2021-06-28 23:53:32,wallstreetbets,Don't do this. You will only lose your money. Especially on Amazon.
2021-06-29 00:02:40,wallstreetbets,"He's stepping down as CEO like 2 weeks before he goes to space.  There's no way a CEO of a trillion dollar company would be able to go to space, because the stock would tank if he died."

2021-06-29 01:19:04,wallstreetbets,I don’t think Jeff Bezos is dumb enough to not make as certain as possible that the security and safety measures involved are as tight as possible before the flight takes place. I’m sure they’ve done a number of successful flights before even finalizing plans for Bezos to be included on one.
2021-06-29 01:22:03,wallstreetbets,"Listen, Amazon, if you don't take this opportunity to capitalize on how much people hate Jeff you'd be fools. 

$299.99 to watch Jeff go boom on demand, fuck. Stock price would hit 6 digits in a week. 

Slow it down, add like 40 camera angles and super high definition 4k. Make it a solid 2 hour ordeal.

Throw in some commentary and Morgan Freeman. Bring in physics models, experts and cg reenactments of those final seconds. 

Throw a theme music track behind it. Either a national anthem like ussr, ccp or yakity sax. Whatever makes the customer happy.

I'm telling you, you'd be fucking fools not to profit on his death. 

He's a rich man, there's plenty of space for dancing on his grave! You'll regret this!"

Also, the risk isn't symmetric. A disaster will tank the stock, but a disaster is much less likely than success, and the multiple for failure won't make up for it."

2021-06-29 06:18:37,wallstreetbets,Bezos already stepped or is stepping down from Amazon so what exactly is the play here? Did anything happen to Apple when Jobs left this world?
2021-06-29 06:24:24,wallstreetbets,"Jeff Bezos is already stepping down as CEO and being replaced by a well groomed AWS Chief Andy Jassy. 


Jeff Bezos blowing up would tank blue origin which has no public interest. 

Amazon would likely not dip at all. If anything, over time, amazon would go up. As Apple did when Steve Jobs died. I'd say Steve Jobs was much more important to Apple then Jeff Bezos has been to Amazon for the last 5 or 6 years."
2021-06-29 06:25:22,wallstreetbets,Lmfao this might actually work.

2021-06-29 06:38:56,wallstreetbets,So Jeff Bezos is stepping down from the CEO role on July 5th. He already runs the company very hands off and isn’t too involved. He spends most of his time enjoying his life now. The stock may not get hit much in the event of his demise.
2021-06-29 06:43:07,wallstreetbets,"Anyone know how much it costs to buy a missile launcher? Surely someone can spend some of the money they made on the squeezes earlier this year.

2021-06-29 06:44:06,wallstreetbets,"Such a bad play there is no DD, just a possible narrative and what OP gut tells him to fit that narrative. Another reason why Bezos stepped down from CEO.

2021-06-29 09:03:19,wallstreetbets,Is that tiger king lol
2021-06-29 09:14:59,wallstreetbets,Nice. So let’s go!
2021-06-29 09:15:07,wallstreetbets,If Bezos doesn’t explode can we ban him from earth.
2021-06-29 09:15:09,wallstreetbets,"You retards know he's stepping down as CEO on July 5th, right?"
2021-06-29 09:15:21,wallstreetbets,Cocaine's a hell of a drug.
2021-06-29 09:20:54,wallstreetbets,"Is the OP the one who created the petition for Bezos not to return to earth? Sounds like dirty wallstreet tricks, so probably a legit put"
2021-06-29 09:20:54,wallstreetbets,I see AMZN puts and I'm in
2021-06-29 09:22:34,wallstreetbets,Not even a horrible idea
2021-06-29 09:23:04,wallstreetbets,"Bezoz stepped down from his position though, it wouldn’t matter if he died. Although investors cared about Jack Ma in relation to Alibaba, so maybe they will care."
2021-06-29 09:23:43,wallstreetbets,Betting on the launch happening on schedule is a pretty risky move when Blue Origin is involved.
2021-06-29 09:23:56,wallstreetbets,"Ground Control to Major Tom  
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong  
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

2021-06-29 09:26:41,wallstreetbets,He's leaving anyway so should be priced in
2021-06-29 09:27:13,wallstreetbets,Based.
2021-06-29 09:29:18,wallstreetbets,Sign the petition so bezos bros stay in space.
2021-06-29 09:45:12,wallstreetbets,Didn't he step down as CEO?
2021-06-29 10:06:30,wallstreetbets,"BILLIONS SHUTTLE LAUNCH FAIL S3E4…

I thought of the same thing when saw the PR about BEZOS going to space.

2021-06-29 10:35:07,wallstreetbets,does it matter though? he's no longer CEO just a rich dude
2021-06-29 10:40:36,wallstreetbets,It’s not even dark if it’s their own fuckin faults LMAO
2021-06-29 10:41:26,wallstreetbets,Bezos stepping down anyways. So him going 💥 is priced in anyways.
2021-06-29 10:42:33,wallstreetbets,just spit out my coffee. lmfao.
2021-06-29 10:54:27,wallstreetbets,"For SPCE, a strangle (or a straddle) might be a good play. If the flight is successful, it'll likely pop heavily, if it blows up and Branson dies, it'll crash. Whatever happens, it's unlikely to stay where it is right before the flight.

IV on the SPCE 07/16 chain is already quite high tho...

Edit: With SPCE trading at ~$50 right now, the 40p 60c 07/16 strangle costs $4.65 and has B/E on $35 / $65. Is this a dumb play?"
2021-06-29 10:56:22,wallstreetbets,This is high tier shit. I thought of this but baldy is very lucky
2021-06-29 10:57:00,wallstreetbets,Finally something worthy of the WSB of yore. I'm rooting for you.
2021-06-29 11:01:23,wallstreetbets,"Jeff Bozos is stepping down from Amazon before the flight, you hair brained ape."
2021-06-29 11:02:55,wallstreetbets,Should I inverse this dingus?
2021-06-29 11:16:40,wallstreetbets,Did you really need a tldr lol
2021-06-29 11:19:04,wallstreetbets,"Imagine you are Jeff Bezos and you see the day before you go into space, tons of people buying AMZN PUTS. haha...."
2021-06-29 11:21:40,wallstreetbets,"I want to know what it cost to insure the richest man in the world and his brother to shoot up in the space on a test flight, especially one without FAA approval."
2021-06-29 11:21:45,wallstreetbets,I did read a theory he was going to fake his own death to protect his wealth. Same for the Gates.’ When the Shtf level stuff. I like your bet!
2021-06-29 11:22:34,wallstreetbets,"Finally some decent content on here. Cheers op will follow ya with a few bucks. Was thinking short spy over the weekend, due to terrorist attacked on us on July 4….slightly darker but same idea"
2021-06-29 11:22:44,wallstreetbets,So if Bezo craters AMZN will too? What if he has a change of mind about the blast off??
2021-06-29 11:22:51,wallstreetbets,"Not only has New Shepard had 15 flights that are completely successful but it also has a Launch escape system that’s capable of pulling the capsule away in the event of a booster failure.

So I have to say that the chance of a crit 1 failure (one that leads to the loss of the crew and vehicle) is quite unlikely.

A few scrubbed launches may mean the stock will fall though."
2021-06-29 11:27:53,wallstreetbets,I hope you’re right! The world would be better off
2021-06-29 11:31:35,wallstreetbets,"Why pay for so much theta, buy the day before the event?"
2021-06-29 11:31:47,wallstreetbets,"Holy fuck I'm scared for your money, but I'm also tremendously rigid at the prospect of gains fueled by atomizing bezos.

2021-06-29 11:38:51,wallstreetbets,GTAV theme
2021-06-29 11:40:43,wallstreetbets,Why do we allow these idiots like Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos to waste our resources on crap like this?
2021-06-29 11:41:39,wallstreetbets,I really don’t believe Branson will rush to beat Bezos: https://youtu.be/TrXWwWnZQJY
2021-06-29 11:44:12,wallstreetbets,"Also, it could be just the opposite right?

A successful space flight could cause Amazons price to go up."
2021-06-29 11:44:18,wallstreetbets,Now that’s what I call hedging
2021-06-29 11:48:32,wallstreetbets,Dude's not even the CEO after next week
2021-06-29 11:50:09,wallstreetbets,This reminds me of that scene in Billions when they go short on that one stock & that astronaut dude’s rocket blows up after launch. Anyone remember that?
2021-06-29 11:58:54,wallstreetbets,What strike are you thinking about? How far will Amazon fall if the bald man stays in space?  -40%?
2021-06-29 12:08:16,wallstreetbets,"RemindMe! July 23rd, 2021"
2021-06-29 12:20:34,wallstreetbets,Now yolo into it
2021-06-29 12:20:36,wallstreetbets,I love your thesis 😂😂😂
2021-06-29 12:57:04,wallstreetbets,I kinda have a feeling AMZN will do just fine without Bezos. Is he really that involved in day to day ops now that he’s trying to become our galactic overlord?
2021-06-29 12:59:20,wallstreetbets,Sayonara Bezo kun
2021-06-29 12:59:32,wallstreetbets,"If you're buying FD's, just remember that these flights are always delayed so just give yourself a little extra time. When are these flights scheduled anyways? I personally think Branson ain't coming back down with his balls intact."

2021-06-29 13:33:04,wallstreetbets,What a fear monger
2021-06-29 13:33:27,wallstreetbets,If only I knew what “fd” meant. 🦧
2021-06-29 13:38:35,wallstreetbets,The SPCE must flow
2021-06-29 13:40:30,wallstreetbets,I freaking love this play.
2021-06-29 13:45:45,wallstreetbets,I believe he already stepped down as CEO of Amazon didn’t he to focus on other ventures like space exploration?
2021-06-29 13:46:34,wallstreetbets,This my be the smoothest smart brain thing I've ever heard of... I'm in.
2021-06-29 13:47:14,wallstreetbets,"This is by far the most retarded DD I’ve seen but fuck it, I’m in!"
2021-06-29 13:59:43,wallstreetbets,"> Some things should not be rushed, space flight is one of those things.


He’s not “rushing” anything, the flight was already scheduled. The only potential change of plan is that Richard may be on the flight now."
2021-06-29 14:01:43,wallstreetbets,Bezos is going to low earth orbit. It's about as dangerous as taking a flight these days
2021-06-29 14:04:25,wallstreetbets,This is the type of shit I stay subbed for.
2021-06-29 14:05:30,wallstreetbets,What if Bezos decides to stay put?
2021-06-29 14:06:56,wallstreetbets,I love this place 😂

2021-06-29 14:27:49,wallstreetbets,Okay so memes aside can anyone actually explain options trading to me? How would you theoretically make money in this scenario?
2021-06-29 14:33:49,wallstreetbets,So retarded it's genius
2021-06-29 14:39:29,wallstreetbets,Bezos is just short on GME

2021-06-29 14:50:00,wallstreetbets,Anyone of you guys in the comments want to follow this guy? Looks very interesting lol.
2021-06-29 14:50:02,wallstreetbets,Yeah I think this should be an official strategy; “Betting on the death of a CEO/Prominent Chairman” investing strategy.
2021-06-29 14:50:53,wallstreetbets,"I don't know much about options, but could you bet on a bunch of people buying in on the 19th by buying puts now? If there is a high demand for puts, could that drive up the price? Or is it related to the stock price exclusively? Things I don't understand someone help."
2021-06-29 15:47:04,wallstreetbets,Rooting for and profiting from Bezos’ death sounds pretty rad- sign me up!
2021-06-29 15:54:17,wallstreetbets,He’s not CEO anymore. I doubt the stock would plunge. Also all smooth brains should know Hw wouldn’t get on unless it were absolutely safe

2021-06-28 22:53:32,wallstreetbets,"Oh man this goes right in-line with my conspiracy theory.

Basically:

* Aliens talk to gov/rich - say we're coming down but carry a deadly virus so you gotta vaccinate the population.
* Gov/rich create a highly infectious, but not too-too bad, disease that spread like wildfire. (Re: Wuhan lab theories) They mix in the alien vacc with the covid vax and spread that around..
* Get media to casually mention alien sightings by government authorities to desensitize people about the idea
* Play with lockdowns incase martial law needs to happen (collect data on trouble makers, hotspots etc)

And now:

* Send Bezos up to discuss logistics and chitchat

How do I buy leaps on aliens landing by 2023??"

2021-06-29 00:03:17,wallstreetbets,"> What's going to land first, the debris or the share price.

That's a trick question. If it gets high enough, most if not all of the debris will be in orbit or burned in the atmosphere.

I'm gonna go with debris before stock price. If it fails, it fails early. My reasoning is, ""because""."

"".................... Butler!  Bury this man under a billion dollars"""
2021-06-29 09:29:03,wallstreetbets,I would guess none. Plus a company wouldn't want to risk their whole corporation on a single person. Amazon probably had key employee insurance when he was still CEO though.

Bezos is stepping down as CEO on July 5th, which I’m sure is no coincidence. Even if he goes boom boom, most of the money in AMZN is institutional and isn’t going to panic over this. 

It might slip to $3000, but $1000 is basically impossible. If it slips to $1000 I’m mortgaging my house and l liquidating everything I own to load up on AMZN."

2021-06-29 04:18:53,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the entertainment. I’d rather read comments like this than watch Netflix
2021-06-29 00:28:01,wallstreetbets,funny thing is people would probably be more likely to get the vax if it was for aliens

2021-06-29 12:08:30,wallstreetbets,you'll need to pull a berry on that one. goto all the banks and ask them to open a spread on it?
2021-06-29 02:10:48,wallstreetbets,"blue origin isn‘t even a space company tho, their rockets are super safe and have a very low blow up chance since they don‘t even go very fast. I was considering a similar move to OP, but this sub orbital booster is not risky enough"
2021-06-29 02:58:25,wallstreetbets,And they were cheering as they watched a man die live lmao
2021-06-29 02:04:18,wallstreetbets,You should watch it it’s basically an episodic version of this post
2021-06-29 02:04:19,wallstreetbets,"Those are tests for a new rocket, his main rockets don’t blow up"
2021-06-29 08:53:15,wallstreetbets,"Lol what? There have been 3 failures out of over 110 falcon 9 launches for Musk. Don't know where the narrative ""they blow up all the time"" comes from when you can see the statistics on wikipedia.

I absolutely like your idea but that statement is just wrong :D"
2021-06-29 02:19:11,wallstreetbets,I just wish Amazon carried season 4+

2021-06-29 00:02:13,wallstreetbets,Just do both? Buy 100 puts and sell 100 puts! Can't loose!
2021-06-29 01:02:47,wallstreetbets,"no, I am not a rich degenerate so you are correct.  A bear put spread would work if I was expecting Bezos to go Boom! But he will probably just anticlimactic go snooze and the stock stays flat so maybe a bullish put spread?"

2021-06-29 08:12:09,wallstreetbets,"Bro this is weird ... I don't wanna be that guy and be like ""oh I was gonna do this too"" but I was legit thinking this as well. Most of the time I'm able to time AMZN puts rather well, I always get burned on calls but thats just me. I was thinking closer to launch looking at strikes around 3,000. Not sure what would be best though"
2021-06-29 10:42:46,wallstreetbets,No he’s just a piece of shit
2021-06-28 23:08:00,wallstreetbets,It is retarded but people will likely sell off...even if he recently resigned he is still the brand name...

2021-06-29 15:46:08,wallstreetbets,Thank you for that clarification. I won’t touch Amazon then. Unlikely bezos goes boom
2021-06-29 08:16:51,wallstreetbets,"So....betting? Which is typically illogical because it is  usually only based on chance just like this scenario? Just because there was a thought process doesn't mean there was logic involved. And if that is all you're referring too I don't see why there would be any need to point that out because then every single post that exists in this sub would have a ""legit logical thought process"" to you."

2021-06-29 03:41:57,wallstreetbets,"Actually suborbit 

Bezos cannot into orbit

Branson cannot into space"
2021-06-29 01:07:16,wallstreetbets,I’m afraid Blue Orgin can’t even orbit anything yet lol.. SpaceX will have to do it.
2021-06-29 01:34:27,wallstreetbets,"All it takes is one pissed-off-at-Bezos person to fuck up one *tiny* thing about the rocket. Or even to just not report a flaw they find. The ""Eat the billionaires"" jokes have been getting more and more prevalent, and hatred of billionaires is pervasive across political ideologies, which across the spectrum are being radicalized in America. I think this is a great bet. I'll probably throw a couple hundred bucks at it, why not."

If I call you a cunt, as I am doing in this instance, know that I don't just think you're a bit thick, and I don't use it to belittle you. It's a statement of dislike.

2021-06-28 22:36:39,wallstreetbets,Thinking of doing the same actually. Not quite 1000 but I feel like clov could be due another big move soon
2021-06-28 22:22:10,wallstreetbets,Down 14k on mine
2021-06-28 23:34:17,wallstreetbets,Definitely. Smart move.
2021-06-29 00:13:50,wallstreetbets,Spew out this garbage? Again LMFAO. Claiming stock is headed to $500 is rational but you need proof that it’s in dump phase. Puh leez.
2021-06-29 00:19:09,wallstreetbets,"Um I never claimed the stock was going to $500, which is evident because I’ve never once made a comment or post like that.  So what you’re saying is you have no proof and you’re just a sheep repeating what you’ve heard others say because you think it makes you sound cool?"
2021-06-29 00:55:58,wallstreetbets,"Theres always gonna be guys like him, not even worth getting worked up, ingnore him."
2021-06-29 00:35:11,wallstreetbets,"Um, asking to provide proof is ridonculous. Everything here isn’t based in fact or have any proof to back it up yet when someone says something counter to your narrative you demand proof. Classic. Here’s your proof : look at the chart and volume."
2021-06-29 00:58:34,wallstreetbets,"I’m not worked up.  I’m doing it so anyone who is holding CLOV and is on the fence or is thinking of buying CLOV will see that this moron is full of shit.  He’s making an accusation he cannot prove, which is pretty much the case of all the people who keep claiming this.  You ask for proof and they either go into into hiding or make excuses"
2021-06-29 00:55:19,wallstreetbets,"That is still not proof.  You allege some conspiracy to pump the stock and dump it by large investors…thus you could find their trades and show it.  But you can’t.  A more likely scenario is the stock took with retail investors and clowns like you flooded Reddit with disinformation you bitch out from proving because you can’t and retail investors believed it and sold.  The second CLOV took immediately Reddit was filled with:
1) it’s controlled by Citadel—> they own 500K shares (0.34%) and in fact own more shares and a greater percentage in AMC
2) it’s a pump and dump to make money to cover for the money they’re losing —> you can find the trades of large institutional investors yet the pump and dump clowns like you don’t.  You shouldn’t go around saying things you can’t back up."
2021-06-29 11:38:15,wallstreetbets,Bet it’s looking better now
2021-06-29 04:08:56,wallstreetbets,Things you can’t back up : 1 & 2. Absurd. Tin hat stuff. Redditt is the best thing that happened to Citadel. They are making more money than ever !!
2021-06-29 09:22:44,wallstreetbets,"Things I can’t back up? 
 [Citadel AMC Ownership ](https://fintel.io/so/us/amc/citadel-advisors-llc)
[Citadel CLOV Ownership](https://fintel.io/so/us/clov/citadel-advisors-llc)

As I have stated, the garbage you spew could be backed by public records but you never provide it.  You either repeat what you hear like a mindless fool, or you intentionally mislead people with bad information."
2021-06-29 09:30:34,wallstreetbets,Who cares what they own??!!!! Of course they own these names as well as thousands of others. Many hedged. AMC GME CLIV can go to $500. They ain’t going out of business. Funny seeing the nonsense people post around Citadel.
2021-06-29 09:40:07,wallstreetbets,"I don’t care what they own.  But you said I could not provide proof and I did.  And a company like AMC is not going to $500 a share.  You are delusional.  That would give it a market cap of like $250 billion, making it one of the top 25 most valuable companies in the world…except those other companies?  They don’t carry billions of dollars of debt and have profitable business operations."
2021-06-29 13:39:07,wallstreetbets,You’ve never made money I can tell are lost it all poor you wah wah wah I’m lil baby

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why is SNDL a good buy? - They are sitting on ~$700M of unrestricted cash on their balance sheet.
- They're in the process of raising a further ~$800M.
- They have zero debt!

They’ve recently tied up with SAF Group - a Private Equity Firm to invest this raised capital to generate asymmetrically enhanced risk-return opportunities in the cannabis industry, in Canada, the US and Internationally. This puts them in such a sweet spot, allowing them to take over companies, capture worldwide market share and vertically integrate their business operations.

As well as being a premium cannabis operator, SNDL is focusing and strengthening its business model towards being a cannabis financier as well, where its able to deploy its capital into multiple market segments within the cannabis sector, across the globe. This is smart as it allows them to increase their exposure whilst minimizing risk. 

I was pleased to see the deployment of funds into acquiring Inner Spirit Holdings which is Canada's largest single brand retailer & increasing stake into The Valens Co. 

SNDL has attracted institutional investment including 

-POTX ETF holding more than 18 Million shares (2nd largest holding), 

-Morgan Stanley & Susquehanna Intl. both acquiring > 11M shares each. 

Plus millions more from: Citadel, Credit Suisse etc.

I’m looking forward to seeing how the management will invests the remaining funds, and I believe the path they’re following will propel them to the top of the chain in the cannabis sector."

2021-06-29 01:08:40,wallstreetbets,I have no idea why your being downvoted. Your correct. I don’t even own the stock rn and tlry just seems like a safer investment.
2021-06-29 09:11:11,wallstreetbets,"Yea maybe true, but I think there will be a pump soon again 
At least for the next Cannabis Hype it will go up like nothing"

2021-06-29 09:05:17,wallstreetbets,Might have to try this to cover my ass
2021-06-28 23:39:10,wallstreetbets,Why aren’t we starting a SPAC weed company?
2021-06-29 00:31:06,wallstreetbets,Start a small Canadian cannabis company and get a bunch of pumpers to convince everyone you’re in the US lol
2021-06-29 01:22:37,wallstreetbets,"Tesla will do $40+ billion in revenue this year. Sundial revenue has been declining the last 4 quarters, last quarter was 9 million dollars. At this rate they should do 15 million in revenue for 2021. In other words they won’t exist by next year. They will just keep taking your money and diluting the stock so you don’t make any"
2021-06-29 10:01:57,wallstreetbets,Iam too. Let's go sndl

2021-06-29 11:37:20,wallstreetbets,"Idk why you're being down voted,  for anyone wondering this is true. Overall the quality of their product is sub-par. But who knows with the memes behind it, anything can happen."
2021-06-29 08:08:48,wallstreetbets,Or bankruptcy. Not everything that’s shorted will be squeezed
2021-06-29 05:44:32,wallstreetbets,that's why I read it
2021-06-28 22:18:20,wallstreetbets,In the future sundial ceases to exist bro lmao
2021-06-29 09:54:46,wallstreetbets,No dude. I specifically said the federal system. Marijuana is definitely still illegal under United States federal law.

I got into it by selling a csp in December when I thought it was the bottom.  January came and there was the correction or downturn or whatever you wanna call it.  I got assigned and I’m just waiting for my break even to sell."

2021-06-29 01:46:08,wallstreetbets,40 bill huh? wow thats alot
2021-06-29 10:42:36,wallstreetbets,Biden isn’t even on board with legalization. He has publicly stated he’s for decriminalization. If a dem president isn’t for it and the senate won’t even pass banking legislation… what are the chances it gets federally legalized? Gotta think practically here 😐
2021-06-29 10:46:45,wallstreetbets,"And I said it already legal in 17 states, which means for each state that makes it legal will be a catalyst to make it on a federal level"
2021-06-29 10:34:38,wallstreetbets,Feds will change the law because bankers want to be able to get into it without any risk
2021-06-29 10:06:50,wallstreetbets,Y'all just need to convince me that US policy change won't have a huge impact on ANY cannabis company
2021-06-29 10:44:11,wallstreetbets,Didn't realize Joe Biden ran Congress who are in majority favor of legalization
2021-06-29 12:29:22,wallstreetbets,I feel like you’ve missed my point entirely
2021-06-29 12:30:32,wallstreetbets,"You might be right, but I’ll believe it when it happens hahaha"
2021-06-29 10:29:36,wallstreetbets,"They act like some of the best weed in the world isn't grown in Canada

Ever heard if people buying beer/cigs from another country and them shipping it

Crazy thought I know"
2021-06-29 10:47:03,wallstreetbets,He can veto dumb ass. Chuck Schumer runs the Senate and he only has a 50-50 split. They can’t even pass a infrastructure bill without bipartisan support. Perhaps you should look into this some more?? Good luck with your shitty diluted company. All you’re doing is paying their management teams living expenses but whatever you wanna do lol
2021-06-29 10:39:10,wallstreetbets,"Oh or maybe how a cash heavy company could be accumulating all that cash waiting for the chance to acquire a company already operating in a shiny brand new market?? Thats just speculation, but hey"
2021-06-29 10:49:22,wallstreetbets,A Democrat vetoing legalization.... and I'm the dumbass lol
2021-06-29 10:53:02,wallstreetbets,Obama vetoed 12. Trump 10. And I’m done here lol
2021-06-29 11:18:49,wallstreetbets,"Bro. If Biden vetoed legalization specifically,  it would kill the Democrats party platform. 

Joe Biden isn't the party lol,  no matter how much you think he is"
2021-06-29 11:35:31,wallstreetbets,"He’s not going to have to because the Senate isn’t going to be able to produce a legalization bill. they might be able to produce a decriminalization bill but either way, fuck Biden and the pussy dems for not moving this situation forward. I thought Trump was going to do something with weed because that definitely would’ve got him more moderates. If he would’ve done anything with weed in a positive way he would still be the president. They’re all idiots."
2021-06-29 12:27:31,wallstreetbets,"The Schumer dude and Booker are drafting one as we speak and there's another one drafted that is attempting to get heard. 

Will it get approved idk, but when over 50% of people agree and major corporations back it,  then it's got a good chance"

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The FinTech Disrupter that everyone is talking about today, none other than Social Finance, Inc aka $SOFI I have been saying for about 2-3 weeks that I would do a DD on $SoFi and figured with the increased volume and mentions today, it is time lay out my own bull thesis.  

SoFi was founded in 2011 by Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady, four students who met at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. The founders hoped SoFi could provide more affordable options for those taking on debt to fund their education. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi#:~:text=SoFi%20was%20founded%20in%202011,debt%20to%20fund%20their%20education.

I am just a big believer in bringing personal finances to the masses and to teach people about personal finance and how to accumulate and build wealth, most parents and schools don’t teach shit on the subject matter. I absolutely love SoFi's statements/mantras:

- Our number one goal is helping our members get their money right. 

- SoFi's mission is to help people reach financial independence to realize their ambitions.

Let's go over some #s.  SoFi has been around and growing as a private company for some time now and has seen seven consecutive quarters of YoY growth w Q1 2021 producing 110% growth and ending w 2.281M members.  This is exponential to say the very least.

I will be linking the data and numbers, but that is all readily available for all the see and find.  The adjusted Net Revenue and EBITDA are increasing and trending in the right direction, with 151% and 70% growth YoY respectively.  The biggest factors to me are they are scaling and accumulating data.  These 2 things are what are going to set companies apart to not only produce growth but obtain profitability to the bottom line. 

The goal of SoFi is to be the one-stop shop for everything a person would need for finance.  Checking/savings accounts, personal loans, home loans, student loans, car loans, budgeting, investing in the markets, and on and on.  The total products used by members has grown by 121% YoY and financial products has grown 273% YoY.  It appears to this layman that they are figuring out to how grow members as well as total products used by member.  https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sofis-q1-earnings-beat-managements-guidance-as-company-prepares-to-trade-on-nasdaq-2021-05

SoFi acquired Golden Pacific Bancorp Inc in its quest to get a federal bank charter, which is cumbersome and tedious process.  This would be an upcoming catalyst for sure if/when this happens https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/sofi-s-bank-buy-presents-blueprint-for-more-fintech-bank-deals-63129976

The Galileo acquisition was a game changer and covered well by u/havocs2 in his DD, I would just add that this has seen 130% YoY (everything seems to be growing triple digits) growth as well. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9l9x6/why_sofi_will_be_sofly_my_78000_yolo_into_sofi/ 

$SoFi was brought to market under the SPAC model and coverage of the stonk has just began.  Coverage was initiated by Oppenheimer w an outperform and was also initiated by Rosenblatt w a buy.  TipRanks has it rated as moderate buy and a price target of $27.50, about a 40% premium to today's closing price.  https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast

I am not a bot, nor am I a shill.  I am very active (to fucking active to be honest) in the daily and I post almost all my plays in real time.  Check my post history and you can see that I have been in this play for some time and believe in the company.

Current positions: 5 $12.50 2023 LEAPS, 2 $20.00 2023 LEAPS, and 155 shares and no intention of dumping or selling short term.

Is there a high SI? is the borrow rate high? Was this targeted because it was a Chamath SPAC?  Probably, i don't know for sure and honestly don't give 2 shits if it is or it is not, I like the company and the stonk and think it is undervalued and will only grow in the future.  That is what the hell I think.  

To be a FinTech disrupter, you obviously need an app and great user-friendly UI and SoFi has a 4.8 rating w over 48K reviews on the $AAPL app store.

TL;DR There is no industry/s that need more disruption than banks and brokerages.  For far too long the poors and working class have been hit w hidden fees, outrageous fees, shit even made-up accounts.  SoFi is the just the company to do this disrupting all in one beautiful app!

Shout out to u/OSRSkarma as he kept pushing to post this."

2021-06-28 23:08:43,wallstreetbets,Every time I check their website they’re adding new features. I love this company.
2021-06-29 04:38:54,wallstreetbets,"Worth more than double what it's trading for.  Their roadmap is amazing and a business model that centers around only doing business with the responsible is guaranteed money.

When will it get there? Who the fuck knows. But it's the least risky stick in the entire sector at these levels.  Would have been one of my Friday DD's if not for the inverse fuckery."
2021-06-28 23:41:02,wallstreetbets,Fuck yes I love Sofi. I’m like 80% SOFI & 20% WISH right now lol
2021-06-28 22:13:44,wallstreetbets,"Sofi feels happy at $21. I bought 4 call options for  7/2 mid day when it was sitting at $18 and I doubled my investment by close. Gonna hold until tomorrow. Not gonna be greedy, but I need the money."
2021-06-28 23:18:20,wallstreetbets,I'm in for shares and call options. Potential moonshot. A true one stop platform for all things personal finance
2021-06-28 23:41:48,wallstreetbets,"If SOFI can absorb over 30 million shares of relentless selling Friday, then sustain more for most of the day Monday and bounce back to close decidedly positive on 56 million shares, I'm all in.  Shorts have failed and are boxed in. Not to mention this is a money maker that hasn't even begun to show us its potential."
2021-06-29 00:06:51,wallstreetbets,"SoFi is the backbone of most of the top growing neobanks and fintechs, it’s crazy.  You’d never know they are SoFi powered.  Chime, Paysafe, Robinhood, Greenlight, Albert, Dave.  List goes on and on.  The analogy to AWS is deserved, they own the space."
2021-06-28 20:59:09,wallstreetbets,"DD needs more emojis, but i'm in w/ a handful of shares and 10/15 calls."
2021-06-28 21:05:24,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the post. Great info!

Position: 1000 shares & 7 calls (various)"
2021-06-28 22:02:09,wallstreetbets,"I like it, after looking at the chart, I will take a decent bite tomorrow.  It has been in the news (CNBC) quite a bit lately.  The SOFI chart starts in only Nov 2020, so not a lot to look at, but it looks slightly oversold (RSI 31) and hopefully a good place to get in around $18 (the .62 retrace area).  Seems to be a declining line or wedge/triangle breakout targeting the mid-30s area with a chance at $42.  The daily PF chart thinks there is a chance of a breakdown to $12, but I like the weekly P&F chart has a target of $42 :)).  Giddy up!  I wish we could post charts here :)"
2021-06-29 00:27:03,wallstreetbets,"SOFI is down for no reason, it’s cheap right now in my opinion. Should go up from here."
2021-06-28 21:02:50,wallstreetbets,"Fuck me, I’m in."
2021-06-28 21:13:37,wallstreetbets,"MOM I MADE IT

Great DD and also huge fan of Sofi in general. As i said it will be a beast over the next 5 years

Positions: 350 shares, a few august $20 calls for earnings and will be buying leaps on any dips like i wanted to today instead of nibbling like an idiot and only picking up a few august calls.

Don’t have a million dollars like some people invested but i think this is a phenomenal company. The future is bright and it is NOT A MEME"
2021-06-28 21:01:54,wallstreetbets,"Love, love, love SOFI and the CEO is awesome!"
2021-06-28 21:15:00,wallstreetbets,Followed you here from Twitter. Great DD. I’m in!
2021-06-28 21:04:39,wallstreetbets,But I want go get in and out quickly with stacks
2021-06-28 23:36:02,wallstreetbets,"10k shares @ $15.95

I’m in it to win it"
2021-06-28 23:50:14,wallstreetbets,it's weird being very bullish on a stock and then seeing it on WSB.

well said , you dont need to apply rainman TA about short squeeze and dark pools and chute and ladder attacks.

it is a company with massive long term potential that just happens to have been drilling to earth's core for the last week or so. 100% value play to me"
2021-06-29 01:40:58,wallstreetbets,"Great DD OP.

SoFi is by far my largest position. People always try to find ”THE unicorn” but fail to see SoFi right in their faces. This thing is going to SOAR."

2021-06-28 23:04:10,wallstreetbets,Purchased 20 21 calls expiring Friday.. Hoping something happens big. Needing to cover a water bungalow for my honeymoon or may be divorced before we are even married!
2021-06-28 23:08:24,wallstreetbets,Anecdotally I think they have adjusted their target audience or they don’t know who it is anymore. They used to have very high standards but recently I got an advertisement from them offering me $20 if I opened an account. It seems a weird match. I don’t know anyone who would open an account for $20 and certainly not the high income earners they used to target. It makes me wonder if they know who they want to be.
2021-06-29 00:00:30,wallstreetbets,I’m in with 25 10/15 22.50’s let’s!
2021-06-29 01:08:15,wallstreetbets,Was a great recovery after the lockup sale of stock brought the price down. I was worried and now more confident as ever after the rebound
2021-06-29 01:17:40,wallstreetbets,I think this will blow up because the name is great and very easily explained alone... Concept is good too
2021-06-29 01:54:25,wallstreetbets,"I love their marketing. Every sports event over the weekend these days has a sofi ad, not to mention a massive stadium too."
2021-06-29 02:09:33,wallstreetbets,"Since the announcement of the merger with the SPAC, I've been accumulating for months. Almost everything you mentioned here, I've already come across. I only wish I had more funds, but it's currently my largest position in my portfolio, and will continue to grow. Their growth is exponential and they have so much more room to disrupt and even become a household name in the coming years. Galileo is their secret weapon, and the amount of revenue that alone generates is not to be overlooked. I am so damn long on SOFI. See you all in early retirement."
2021-06-29 02:39:29,wallstreetbets,Don’t forget the next super bowl.  Where at? You ask? We’ll SoFi Stadium of course.
2021-06-29 03:06:48,wallstreetbets,Sofi 🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-29 03:27:07,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been all in since early May. Since then I’ve also moved most of my finances over to Sofi. I have a Sofi Money account where my paychecks get deposited, the credit card where all my bills are paid and I’ve used their “Relay” functionality to link all my other financial accounts so I can see my net worth updating in real time. I love it. The only thing I don’t have is an Invest account as they don’t have margin/options capability yet. Hopefully by the end of the year though and the I can transfer all my investments over as well. I’m a happy customer and hope to be a very happy investor soon."
2021-06-29 05:08:30,wallstreetbets,This will be like buying SQ or PayPal a few years ago.
2021-06-29 05:35:17,wallstreetbets,"Just lol if your not holding this stock long. SoFi is going to be huge in the coming years. 

5 years this will be seeing triple digits IMO. Big stock, big growth."
2021-06-29 05:35:44,wallstreetbets,Rolling in with 100 shares. Wish everyone luck.

2021-06-29 08:01:44,wallstreetbets,Lockup expiration sales created a good buying opportunity.  Not a short squeeze.  Not a P&D.  Just a solid investment in good company with great long term prospects.  Good luck

2021-06-28 23:22:17,wallstreetbets,I scored hard with some 7/2 17.5 calls I had. Sold most of them and exercised the last few for 300 shares.

2021-06-29 00:15:06,wallstreetbets,"IV is low for the short term money. Open Interest is good into 2022. Shares are smart for a 35% upside just to the new high. This is a smart move. Thanks for sharing. I'll watch, and be in by end of week when the right openings."

2021-06-29 09:48:01,wallstreetbets,"Just commenting to say that SoFi as a financial service is really fantastic. I’ve been using them as my primary investment platform since the whole GME/RH fiasco, with both a taxable and a Roth IRA, as well as their 2%-back-on-everything credit card. Eventually I’ll also use their Money service as my bank account, ditching the brick and mortar bank that I’ve used for decades."
2021-06-29 09:50:44,wallstreetbets,Lol best trap!
2021-06-29 12:19:14,wallstreetbets,"I switched to SoFi simply because of their interest rate a couple years ago, and I also liked their logo."
2021-06-29 00:49:19,wallstreetbets,I always read $SOFI as so-fee. Which i then translate to Sophie... which is a homemade dildo in prison... You're welcome

PLTR lock up didn’t take the stock lower for about a week or so IIRC. 
Just something to look into. Not financial advice."

2021-06-29 01:12:55,wallstreetbets,"SoFi is a bank stock like rocket not a tech stock

Blend is dominating the B2B fintech software field. 1/3 of all mortgages utilizes its platform and they’ve recently rolled out consumer banking (personal loans, credit cards, specialty). That’s the real tech play - sell software to other FIs and let the FIs duke it out 

My position - shares and calls, been buying $40c since January lol"

2021-06-28 21:44:22,wallstreetbets,the sofi app is garbage.
2021-06-29 04:14:26,wallstreetbets,"Is that you, Chamath?"
2021-06-29 14:42:42,wallstreetbets,"(I will post this in all SOFI threads, as I sense some pump-and-dump going on)


From [Yahoo Finance's site](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOFI/key-statistics?p=SOFI):

> Shares Short (Jun 14, 2021) 	28.28M

> Short Ratio (Jun 14, 2021)         3.64

> Short % of Float (Jun 14, 2021) 	N/A

> Short % of Shares Outstanding (Jun 14, 2021) 	3.56%

So where is this ""148%"" short interest coming from?

Disclaimer: I have no interest in SOFI, just WSB.."
2021-06-28 21:13:02,wallstreetbets,Nope
2021-06-29 05:14:38,wallstreetbets,you still in those july calls? or did you exit that position when it spiked to 24ish

Anyways, nice to see some endorsement on this one. Got in yesterday at 18.39 after spending hours contemplating if would be worth it or not. Just seemed like a way to good deal at that price."

2021-06-29 01:31:56,wallstreetbets,Same here; if it hits a peak in the AM I'm gonna take the $ off that then wait for another dip and get back in. Hoping we open tomorrow with a spike to hit atleast 21.

2021-06-28 23:52:28,wallstreetbets,"Most of their revenues used to come from student loans, so they had a very select customer base. Now, they’ve added so many products and not to mention Galileo has been a huge success, that student loans are making up an increasingly smaller pie. So the focus is on growth and products/relationship. Get as many people to join any product group and then cross them other sticky products once they do all while helping people become more financially educated and successful. That’s the reason for the change, imo"
2021-06-29 00:01:04,wallstreetbets,I like it. Good luck!

2021-06-28 21:53:42,wallstreetbets,the investment part of the app is particularly hot garbage.
2021-06-29 02:31:48,wallstreetbets,"no, if you’ve used the app you understand. the investing portion lacks realized gains/losses. does that make sense to any trader? you literally have to wait end of year for your tax statement for SoFi to send this information to you. otherwise you have to track it yourself. 

this app has other examples of low functionality. it’s a shit app. the only good thing about it is that it is a “one stop shop”. but i lost money trading on sofi and i had to spend literal hours calculating my cost basis by hand."

2021-06-29 07:46:17,wallstreetbets,"Well, some thoughts on Galileo : (1) they're expanding internationally, and (2) it's per-transaction revenue. Really the question is how fintech vs traditional transactions will change over time. For example, how many debit card transactions are there now among fintechs vs. traditional banks? That's where I see growth in Galileo happening, it's directly tied to rate of transactions moving out of traditional space to fintech space."

2021-06-28 23:22:17,wallstreetbets,its not recently added. been there for a while now. the way orders are handled in the investment section of the app is painfully slow and they give you a very poor spread. and the etfs sofi are putting out are extremely low volume garbage gimmicks with high expense ratios that dont even pay out the true dividend of the underlying assets.
2021-06-29 13:32:58,wallstreetbets,Floating or doing any rapids? Just hit up ATVs and some white water in WY past week was nice to take off. Look at you with leg 3 though ... assuming whole family now. Lucky man and enjoy!!

2021-06-29 14:43:56,wallstreetbets,Which should be legalized to put cartels out of business

2021-06-29 15:47:20,wallstreetbets,"Sure, let's just legalize human trafficking too, that will also help put them out of business. Oh, you don't agree? You think there will be even more human trafficking than before? You think that human trafficking is bad? No, it's not, it's legal! As a matter of fact, it will be sponsored by the government and we will make tons of money. 

Let's legalize cocaine. There will be an excessive increase in drug addictions nationwide. You don't think so? Well, if murder was legal, a lot more people would be murdered without the repercussions of law, so why wouldn't there be an extreme uptick in the cases of cocaine addiction and cocaine related deaths? You want that? You want people's kids so easily exposed to the drug? Kids huff paint for christs sake, what will stop them from reaching into daddy's powder closet? But it's okay, cartels will be out of business. Government will regulate the good cocaine so nothing bad gets out, and everyone will be happy. You know what is a drug that is super legal but used to be illegal and wiped out the need for black-market deals a century ago? Alcohol. Alcohol leads to 5% of all annual deaths worldwide, and leads to an excessive amount of health-related problems that also would cause death or impairment of life.

There is a case for legalizing weed, even though in my personal opinion (no resources, only from my own experience), it just creates a ton of bumass junkies who are broke and blame the government, but please do not try to create a case for legalizing a drug that will destroy families and lives almost instantly. That's just insane."

2021-06-29 18:00:25,wallstreetbets,"Your pea brain lost focus after the first paragraph, which is sad. And they are related, they are both controlled by law and punishable by law and lead to the devastation of families worldwide.

The stupidest thing I've ever heard is to deal with crime by making it legal."
2021-06-29 16:05:44,wallstreetbets,"Then what about my kids? What if I'm not hooked, but when I'm out at work, my kid breaks into my stash and dies? What's stopping everyone from trying it once and getting hooked? Why would you willingly want to let all of their futures get ruined? It might be on them, or is it on you for allowing that possibility to come to fruition?

What about murder? What if that was legal? If someone get's murdered, is that on them? Or is it on us for allowing such an atrocity to be made legal? If there are no repercussions for indulging in such things, then humans will inevitably be more inclined to do it. Drug overdoses would reach new heights and grow exponentially, same with murders. 

But that's on them, right?"
2021-06-29 16:09:13,wallstreetbets,"Personal responsibility and strong parenting skills. The world is not your loophole to get out of your responsibilities as a parent/law abiding citizen.

2021-06-29 19:14:11,wallstreetbets,I had a TD account years ago I just started up with Robinhood this year. Planning on switching over once I sell the shares at 25+
2021-06-29 18:34:59,wallstreetbets,I’ve been in worse situations. Started with 40k investing starting feb. aphria stock( merged with tilray) took me to school I lost 35k Getting bombarded with margin calls every day. 5k left…. Started yoloing options and made it up to 100k. Let’s go! My position has fully maxed out margin almost
2021-06-29 10:51:10,wallstreetbets,Lol. I just got a new iPhone 12 Pro from wish gains! I like 👍
2021-06-29 00:20:02,wallstreetbets,A lot of people as well as I discovered WSB around that time due to GME squeeze. I believe in this stock.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-29 17:16:42,wallstreetbets,It’s possible but seems like a lot of paper hands and Penny flippers are in there at the moment. I think it’s more like a long-term investment type stock
2021-06-29 14:54:56,wallstreetbets,Good for u
2021-06-29 15:41:13,wallstreetbets,Hey..how do you identify a bot or spy???
2021-06-29 15:58:51,wallstreetbets,I’ll do that soon after my wishes are granted
2021-06-29 17:12:00,wallstreetbets,"Lol. I’ve had a wish position for the last three weeks. Very suspicious  hahaha.  Be careful everyone, I promote wish because I love the stock and have position in it. Be very very careful hahaha"

2021-06-29 16:30:04,wallstreetbets,"It is a pivot point. It was a support in March and it was a resistance in April. As soon as it breaks it, the trend will continue and then $15,5 will be a support point again."
2021-06-29 12:47:01,wallstreetbets,You have a good avg. just continue to hold its gonna fly

2021-06-29 17:40:06,wallstreetbets,Beware that hedge funds are pumping and dumping hyped stocks. To deter folks from purchasing GME and AMC
2021-06-29 18:08:39,wallstreetbets,Bananas and green crayons only for my venmo tipjar @NeoEpoch all proceeds go to lawyer fees to get my kids away from my ex wife's boyfriend.
2021-06-29 18:59:49,wallstreetbets,like tonight.
2021-06-29 19:16:28,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood bad, real bad homie. Wish good tho respect"
2021-06-29 19:16:08,wallstreetbets,Oh okay. Thanks
2021-06-29 14:14:46,wallstreetbets,They can choose whichever company they believe in as long as they appear as genuine investor or even WSB gambling retard. Problem is that OP is neither.
2021-06-29 17:08:38,wallstreetbets,"I had options and shares in a AMC and made ridiculous gains from $30 to 68 I feel that AMC has peaked out. Wish is long term, but also feel it is good short term as well."
2021-06-29 14:38:14,wallstreetbets,"True, you shouldn’t trust me either."
2021-06-29 19:17:45,wallstreetbets,"I see at minimum back to IPO prices around 25. Many institutions like JP Morgan,Morgan Stanley etc have tons of shares at around $18. Average analyst price target is about $24. If you look at a bunch of the e-commerce stocks they have shot up tenfold or more like Etsy, shop, etc. This company is deeply undervalued and has a lot of upside potential. No debt and 2 billion in cash, revenue increasing year-by-year. Amazon wanted to buy them 6 years ago for $10 billion CEO said no. Very bullish long term"
2021-06-29 16:29:59,wallstreetbets,I know plenty of people who ball out on wish. I used to when I was buying a ton of things on the cheap side.
2021-06-29 17:55:22,wallstreetbets,My wife buys large black bananas from wish so she can be ready for her boyfriend
2021-06-29 19:23:56,wallstreetbets,"I went on a wish buying spree during covid and I can personally vouch for the quality of products and service. They offer tons of unique items in electronics, gadgets, lighting, drones, photography..... You get the idea.  I was amazed by their variety  and happy with the pricing of those items. I only really had one issue with them and it was clearly stated in their t.o.s. so they gave me warning. The tos states that in order to keep their prices low the items they ship might not be exactly what is advertised and if the product was close then it wasn't their problem. They keep their prices low by knowingly shipping products that aren't what the buyer is ordering and telling the customer it's not their problem in advance. To make matters worse their customer service is absolutely awful regarding anything and on those rare instances where they are even willing to consider crediting your account or accept a return, they will never refund the massive shipping costs (often more than the items themselves). The fact that they are even able to remain in business is astonishing in the first place so the stock price being pumped enough to make a lot of money for those willing to risk it is well within the realm of possibility for this company."
2021-06-29 13:51:16,wallstreetbets,you must not get out much
2021-06-29 16:26:07,wallstreetbets,"I fuckin love wish,  once you know you size you can get so many dope shirts"
2021-06-29 14:31:47,wallstreetbets,True... Everything under 10 cent
2021-06-29 14:35:07,wallstreetbets,"I work at the post office. Let me guarantee you, they are ordering tons."
2021-06-29 14:24:39,wallstreetbets,🙋🏽‍♀️Me
2021-06-29 17:01:58,wallstreetbets,I don’t buy things from Etsy. Too expensive and personalized and handmade. This is for low income people who want great deals on cheaper unique products. There’s a market for everything🚀
2021-06-29 16:19:33,wallstreetbets,Me 😒
2021-06-29 16:19:57,wallstreetbets,My coworkers love this app

2021-06-29 14:00:51,wallstreetbets,"I’m out and about everyday. 

Granted, I rarely ever talk about wish with anyone"
2021-06-29 16:20:51,wallstreetbets,They have any drawers or coffee table you could get here in the states …. Literally HALF PRICE
2021-06-29 17:52:04,wallstreetbets,If the play doesn't work out can you hook us up with some jobs? Wish hasn't been kind to many of us.
2021-06-29 10:52:52,wallstreetbets,"Back to $14.15 now, I need to stop checking it but it’s the most entertaining thing to do at my wageslave job"
2021-06-29 09:03:10,wallstreetbets,Sharing is caring
2021-06-29 18:15:39,wallstreetbets,True story. Ex is a Cee yoU Next Tuesday. She tells me that she's gonna kill herself and says in text that she will sign my kids over to me without a fight. I've been fighting for them for over a year now. Shit ton more to the story. $1.99/minute.
2021-06-29 14:59:15,wallstreetbets,"I don’t care about spce, never have"
2021-06-29 11:20:35,wallstreetbets,"I bought this dip, 500 more@13.97 and 500 @ 14. Going to sleep for an hour or 2. Every time I do that with WISH my wishes come true.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-29 11:30:15,wallstreetbets,"My advice is to stop checking it. It's going to be a while before we see real gains. Since you bought shares and the market cap is pretty huge, it's gonna take patience. It'll fluctuate a bunch but the long term trend will be up. It's not just this community of retards that think so either. The analyst ratings have it as undervalued as well! It's a good play long term. Just give it time and don't panic just cause it dips a dollar."
2021-06-29 11:21:59,wallstreetbets,"Soon You won’t need to work, all in on WISH!"
2021-06-29 15:00:41,wallstreetbets,Most in red Einstein. Go to ur mom now

2021-06-28 20:57:24,wallstreetbets,"How did anybody ""miss out on AMC""?? When it hasn't even happened yet??

They are still selling a $750k stock for less that 60 bucks right now!! 

Not finacial advice"
2021-06-28 21:10:03,wallstreetbets,Can someone point me to AMC DD? I thought GME was “the only one”.

2021-06-29 07:15:53,wallstreetbets,AMC GME
2021-06-29 08:11:44,wallstreetbets,The hedges are doing anything there power throwing bad news about this cause they want us to sell now but if we hold we can cripple them. They have been screwing us forever. So buy and hold this can go into the thousands a share.

2021-06-28 21:16:50,wallstreetbets,People got back in on AMC when they saw that it stayed around $50. We can see AMC reach $100 soon.

2021-06-29 07:58:25,wallstreetbets,"It is about fundamentals though. About fundamentals of the game. And the fundamentals of the game ar rigged as fuck, but we fucking beat the system.

Time is all we need now. They lose money through time. We make money in time."
2021-06-29 10:23:08,wallstreetbets,Lol you’re right it’s about shilling a shitty company. It’s not GME or AMC. The short interest isn’t there neither is the opportunity to recover which was the catalyst for the stock to take off and cause shorts to cover. But what do I know. I only made a good chunk of money off GME buying below $40.
2021-06-29 10:24:52,wallstreetbets,Still a shit company that’s failed to turn around for years if not decades at this point.

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Tilray Analysis # Tilray:

Tiray is a global researcher, cultivator, processor, and distributor of cannabis products founded in 2013 by Brendan Kennedy, Micheal Blue, and Christian Groh. It is headquartered in Nanaimo, Canada, but has operations throughout North and South America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and South Africa.

# Irwin Simon:

Irwin Simon graduated from Saint Mary’s University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1979 and worked many sales and marketing positions with food companies. He then acquired Hain Celestial Group, a natural food business, becoming Chairman and CEO. Under his leadership Hain is now the largest natural food business in the U.S.A. having over $200 million in sales revenue and control over 18 health food companies. He became Chairman and CEO of Aphria, a Canadian based cannabis company, in December of 2018. Irwin Simon became Chairman and CEO of Tilray in May 2021 after the merger between Aphria and Tilray.

|2020|$24,655|

Financials show steady year over year growth for Tilray excluding 2019 and much more is expected in 2021 due to the merger between Aphria and Tilray.

# Opportunity:

Historically cannabis has been a product that was illegal and unbranded. However, governments recently began legalizing the trade and use of cannabis in many different countries. The cannabis market will further develop as a result of this increase in demand and will provide opportunity for companies such as Tilray to dominate this market because it is relatively new. Tilray is positioned to take advantage of this market because of their wide reach from operations in 17 countries as well as its diverse multitude of products.

# Merger:

Tilray became the world’s largest cannabis company after the merger between Aphria and Tilray on May 3, 2021. Before the merger Tilray was a much smaller company compared to Aphria with Tilray having a market cap of $3.3 billion and Aphria having a market cap of $4.9 billion. However, Tilray had a market cap of $6.1 soon after the merger resulting in more influence for the company. Due to the larger market cap of Aphria before the merger they have more authority over Tilray with their shareholders owning 62% of the company.

# Stock Price:

Tilray’s stock price is undervalued compared to its competitors. As of June 27, 2021 the market cap of Tilray is 5.63 billion CAD; however, competitors such as Canopy Growth (11.60) or Curaleaf (12.55) have a higher market cap but do not justify it with higher revenue. The stock price of Tilray is about 40% lower than the highs even though the fundamentals of the company have only been getting better. As a result of this Tilray is not only undervalued compared to its competitors but also compared to its previous stock price. Sentiment among retail traders, momentum in stock price, and potential legalization of cannabis products could cause a short term increase in the stock price."

2021-06-29 03:51:37,wallstreetbets,"Well that's convenient for you because you are most certainly going to lose this money.

AMC can tear up 20% gains every day until expiration and you'll need another 100% to go.  Fucking retard.  There were so many better strike prices to send 10k at that *might* have had a chance for you, but no.. You strapped that helmet on as tight as it could go and snorted a line of rubber cement and said fuck this YOLO!!!!    Learn how options work.  And gtfo off robinhood."
2021-06-29 11:00:14,wallstreetbets,Why don’t you roll to something more reasonable? 💎🙌 is not for options dumbass. You still have almost 10k to drop on shares or calls on a further date.

2021-06-29 01:17:23,wallstreetbets,"Somehow i feel like it’s worse. GME hit 500 briefly so 800 is 60% gains.

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why Weed? TLRY DD The mega-merger deal between Canadian cannabis companies Aphria and Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) was the highlight of the marijuana industry this year. The deal closed on May 3 and the ""new"" Tilray was formed, and in the process, became the world's largest cannabis company by revenue.   

The legacy Aphria has always been a strong contender in the cannabis space because of its smart growth strategies. Legacy Tilray, on the other hand, was a rather small company, which had a market cap of $1.1 billion before the merger was announced, but now holds a market cap of $7.7 billion.

This brought the newly combined company closer to the two leaders in the cannabis space: U.S. cannabis company Curaleaf Holdings, with a market cap of $9.5 billion, and Ontario, Canada-based Canopy Growth, with a market cap of $9.0 billion.

Since this was a reverse merger, the legacy Aphria's management holds the decision-making powers. In fact, Aphria's shareholders now own 62% of the new company, with Irwin Simon (Aphria's CEO and chairman) leading the combined entity. Here are all the ways Tilray can benefit from this merger, and why this business is a smart buy for the long term.


What's in this merger deal for Tilray?
Mergers and acquisitions are not uncommon in the marijuana industry. Before this merger, Aphria acquired American craft beer maker SweetWater Brewing in November 2020 to make an entry into the U.S. cannabis beverage market. Beverages are part of cannabis derivatives (vapes, edibles, concentrates, and more), additional recreational products that Canada legalized in October 2019. Tilray had already made an entry into this category in October with a new line of cannabis-infused edibles through its wholly owned subsidiary High Park Holdings. By pooling its resources and capital, the combined company can launch even more derivatives, competing with peers like Canopy that are rapidly expanding in this segment

In its recent fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 results, the legacy Tilray recorded a 20.5% year-over-year jump in revenue to $57 million. For the full year, the company reported a 26% increase in revenue to $210 million from 2019. Tilray also saw a positive adjusted EBITDA (earnings before income, tax, depreciation, and amortization) of $2.2 million, compared to a loss of $35.3 million in the year-ago period. This was Tilray's first quarter of positive EBITDA before merging with Aphria -- and it is a good start.

Aphria has been generating positive adjusted EBITDA over the past seven quarters. Now, Aphria's strong balance sheet and its management driving the bus can make the new Tilray a profitable cannabis company. (EBITDA measures a company's operational performance, whereas true profitability is the total earnings after all deductions are made.) By merging with Aphria, Tilray has equipped itself to both expand and grow.

A steady hand on the wheel
A bigger company has some benefits -- access to a lot of resources, manpower, and capital. But bigger is not always better. A bigger company can also be difficult to manage. It could face complications with cost synergies, hidden inefficiencies, merger costs, and personnel. That's why Irwin's leadership is so important -- we can expect the company to smoothly handle any challenges.

As CEO, Irwin successfully founded and led consumer goods company Hain Celestial Group to success before doing the same for Aphria. Aphria survived and thrived amid a global crisis because of Simon and his leadership team's smart growth strategies of focusing on their core operations and strengthening their brands and balance sheet, rather than spending cash haphazardly on acquisitions. It appears Simon plans to follow the same strategy for new Tilray -- building its existing brands and focusing on its roots in Canada.

On June 8, Tilray launched a new medical cannabis brand, Symbios, and a high-potency medical cannabis topical under the Aphria brand for the Canadian market.

A smart buy for the long term
The European cannabis market could grow at a compound annual growth rate of 29.6% to be worth $37 billion by 2027. This could be a lucrative opportunity for Tilray. Simon expects to use Tilray's Portugal facility to help in expanding into the European market. The company holds a cultivation license from the government of Portugal to produce medical marijuana products and export them throughout the continent.

Aphria already has a strong market presence in the medical cannabis business not only in Canada and Europe, but also in Africa, South America, and Oceania. It generates close to 97% of its distribution revenue from its Germany-based subsidiary, CC Pharma.

With prospects of federal legalization in the U.S. also strengthening, the new Tilray could be a strong contender in the U.S. cannabis market five years down the line. In the meantime, the European, international, and Canadian markets can be its revenue growth driver for now. We will know more about the new Tilray's performance and its long-term growth strategies when it reports its next quarterly results. Management expects the merger's operational efficiencies to generate $81 million in annual pre-tax cost-saving synergies within 18 months.

If you have faith in the growth of the marijuana industry, Tilray is a smart buy for the long term. Two strong companies with an expanded international presence, strong balance sheet, growing revenues moving closer to profitability, and a good leadership team are all set to become a cannabis powerhouse. That said, do not expect any short-term gains, as a merger integration takes time. So if you can bear the short-term risks to enjoy fruitful gains in the future, this cannabis stock is for you.

2021-06-28 21:56:53,wallstreetbets,"Because then they can sell weed here. For at least a time, they will have a head start. A US company probably outdoes them at some point, but first to market matters. 

And everyone forgets their global footprint. EU is no small market. So don't count out their ability to profit internationally, including in the US."
2021-06-29 02:31:27,wallstreetbets,"It doesn’t matter. If people recognize the name, they will buy the stock, if the US legalizes."
2021-06-28 21:03:11,wallstreetbets,"I won't argue with your WSB yolo, but TLRY and the Canadian LP's have nearly no shot at out performing the US MSO's fundamentally. They don't have the capital to scale or acquire an MSO because their balance sheet is so bad. The best they could do is maybe acquire a microcap MSO. If they did M&A in early 2020, it would've been great, but they would have lost their listing status. The Canadians are a trade while the Americans are an investment. LP's are in an unfortunate position because they are listed on the US exchanges, but because of that, they are locked out of actually selling THC in the US. 

Just FYI, Europe is kind of like USA back when California first legalized a decade + ago. Unless they really expedite the legalization process, it will take some time. So US markets are a good 3-5 year outlook while Europe will be good 5-15 years. Curaleaf is also in Europe. 

Speaking of Curaleaf, they made more revenue than CGC/SNDL/APHA in 2020 COMBINED. They also have less market cap than just CGC. Retail traders need to start learning that LP's can't compare with the MSO's. Big 4 MSO's are already generating positive EBIDTA and free cash flow while scaling in key states. The biggest LP's have been burning cash like it's their job. CGC lost 1 billion in 2020 alone.

https://twitter.com/cashflow_free - This guy is a great follow with unbiased numbers and modeling of value for the MSO's. Just compare EBIDTA or Revenues and you'll see the major difference."
2021-06-28 20:17:40,wallstreetbets,Localized... for now
2021-06-28 21:08:26,wallstreetbets,"Idk what MSO is. The only American weed stocks I can think of are Constellation Brands and Altria. Neither are pureplay. It is a wait and watch for me.

2021-06-28 22:36:28,wallstreetbets,What about all the companies already operating in the USA like curaleaf cresco gti trulieve that have bigger market caps already and they’re only still trading OTC? What if the USA doesn’t allow foreign import? Why not just invest in the better companies?
2021-06-28 22:07:43,wallstreetbets,"There’s bigger companies in the USA like curaleaf selling weed so it doesn’t make sense what your saying. Those companies have first mover advantage. Additionally, curaleaf has a presence in Europe and Columbia care has had an overseas contract for years now. Tilray is pretty much screwed in the USA. That’s why you see companies like CGC and CRON buying options in MSOs…. Tilray won’t be able to acquire an MSOs they’re market caps are bigger than tilrays bro. Gotta do some more DD my man!"
2021-06-28 21:12:58,wallstreetbets,"I don’t disagree with your reasoning for Curaleaf. But I don’t think curaleaf will be the only successful cannabis company. There will be competition and it will be fierce. 

Depends on how legalization looks. I like TLRY’s trade volume. It was a $77 stock February. And if it manages to be worth 3X curaleaf in terms of market cap, it can easily accomplish a reverse merger with it. If we all decide TLRY is gonna be the winner. Than it’s market cap will be huge. And they can buy out a big macro cap company. Everything you said above is speculation just like what I wrote here. It’s all speculation. 

Depends on how the market sees TLRY.

Even let’s assume TLRY pays much more for an MSOS. We still early :). The investment is great long term."
2021-06-28 22:23:42,wallstreetbets,"Honest question, looking at cost of growing weed, how big of a factor is geography?
I would think you could grow more for less money in California than in a warehouse in Canada. Better yet in central and South America, although crossing borders could end up being expensive. 

So would having more international operations be better? Not necessarily for sales but for supply? Or do you think American growers will will dominate American sales?"
2021-06-29 11:56:47,wallstreetbets,Curaleaf and trulieve are the big boys in the usa. They will be like Coke and Pepsi.
2021-06-28 20:20:34,wallstreetbets,And same goes for TLRY…. For now. They will be in US and be very competitive in the future. Big potential
2021-06-28 21:17:20,wallstreetbets,"MSO = multi state operators, and their fanboys would argue they are a viable alternative. Hard pass for me, TLRY to the fucking moon because among other reasons, their revenue stream is diverse as they’re a CPG company, not a one trick pony selling just weed"
2021-06-28 20:31:56,wallstreetbets,No you all good! Just load up 🚀
2021-06-28 22:31:28,wallstreetbets,"Dude half the items in your local grocery store Are imported from other countries you realize this right? 

Tilray has partners with Busch Anheiser which owns 45% of all beer sold in the United States. 

Their supply chains are already locked in and ready to go."
2021-06-28 22:33:32,wallstreetbets,"Also the markets proven to love Tilray when cannabis catalysts hit.

There I said what we all know. It’s the easiest return on investment. Fundamentals won’t matter"
2021-06-28 22:46:06,wallstreetbets,"It's not speculation that the big 4 MSO's are spitting out cash flow like no one's business. As growth companies even. If WSB wants to pump TLRY, go ahead, but fundamentally it does not even compare with the MSO's. It's just like you say, the only shot that TLRY, or any other LP have of building a solid footprint in the US is by way of a share offering on a fundamentally overpriced stock. If they can take advantage of their listing status, they may be able to skyrocket and gain enough cash through offerings to try and obtain a tier 2 or 3 MSO. They don't have a shot at a tier 1 MSO because the market caps are too close now. Again, TLRY could have a short term rip on any US legislature, but eventually, the markets will vote for the fundamentally stronger companies. Unfortunately, that appears to be the US MSO's as they are fundamentally outperforming the LP's even though their own gov't won't allow them to list on their native exchange, their own gov't forces them to do cash only transactions and doesn't allow them access to banking, AND their own gov't taxes them 2x what is normally taxed for a business (280E). In spite of the gov't hindering their business, the MSO's are thriving. Trulieve and Green Thumb are EPS POSITIVE as growth companies! That's incredible. They pay double the taxes of a regular company. Cresco and Curlaleaf aren't far behind either. All four that I mentioned are EBITDA positive and cash flow positive. The balance sheets are fat and healthy for the next M&A deal."
2021-06-28 22:55:59,wallstreetbets,"Weed isn't expensive to grow in the right environment. As you say, geography is a definitely a factor and that's why certain MSO's invest in California, at the expense of their own margin profile. They learn how to efficiently grow in a mature market and they learn techniques of growing where it is difficult.  I think that the US will have their own best interest in mind when implementing federal legislation. Why would the US just allow companies to grow across borders and import it? It doesn't make sense, especially considering how corrupt these politicians are. I think that grown in American plant will dominate American sales. I even think that the US will try to stick to a States model, where states govern the plant grown in their own borders. We're at a major point in the industry where the States model might try to shift to a federal model, so I can't opine as to what will happen, but I believe the States model is much better for our MSO investments. Federal model won't be great for margins. Wholesale will probably be better in the long run for the Federal model. Think Herr's or Utz CPG for weed. Right now, the MSO's are in purgatory trying to figure out whether to focus on wholesale or retail. The better performing MSO's like Green thumb and Trulieve are more retail focused while the MSO's with lower margins like Cresco and Curaleaf are risking their margin profile to focus on wholesale and establish a national brand."
2021-06-28 22:55:15,wallstreetbets,"Most grow ops are in “warehouses” to regulate temperature, bugs etc. So I don’t see how geography would affect growing potential."
2021-06-29 02:34:17,wallstreetbets,It costs less than $100 to grow a pound of weed indoors and less than $30 to grow a pound outdoors. The only thing that keeps the price up is legality and taxes.
2021-06-28 20:31:29,wallstreetbets,"I would disagree. I would think Canadian companies won’t get any sort of reasonable footprint in the US until federalizations (5-15 years down the line?) or major legislation that allows acquisition (SAFE act? perhaps 1-3 years?). But the limited license structure of the US won’t change during that time because that’s how it’s being set up and is proven to work; aka US operators will remain dominant, not Canadian. Also just take a look at Q/Q revenue growth, share dilution, and business margins between Tilray and any US operator. You’ll never invest in Tilray again"
2021-06-28 21:36:53,wallstreetbets,Your a moron. MSOs are way better investments.
2021-06-28 22:37:42,wallstreetbets,We are talking about marijuana lmao Jesus you guys are dilusional.
2021-06-28 22:51:26,wallstreetbets,"Well Said. That’s why I like TLRY better. 

And once legalization does happen who is to say that US won’t be saturated just like it happened in Canada? With lower margin cannabis sold as competition intensifies ? At least we know TLRY is the leader in market share in Canada. They competed with 800 LPs in the market and have survived.

It’s just like natural selection. Put the best products in the market customers tend to gravitate towards the best ones. If MSOS is gonna have Nokia type branding or products than even if TLRY is late they can get a good chunk of that share. Products #matter quality #matters. Someone should compare MSOS to TLRY products. I’m interested in that. We still don’t have all the data.

All in all don’t discount TLRY. I’m not discounting MSOS either."
2021-06-29 07:40:56,wallstreetbets,"Good stuff, thanks. The us certainly needs the tax revenue, tariffs on weed imports will be easy to get away with being a new industry, it will be a political game. I still like tlry in the short term, I can get good money selling calls, like you said, it’s a good trade, but the us companies look like better investments, and once they are listed on a major exchange I can see them taking off"
2021-06-29 07:26:45,wallstreetbets,"Outdoor growing is also subpar shit compared to indoor

But Americans are used to Mexican ditch weed so who knows"
2021-06-28 21:34:31,wallstreetbets,You are correct. Op is prob a bag holder from the $300 squeeze. Tilray is definitely not the best weed company. Curaleaf cresco gti trulieve???
2021-06-28 20:35:21,wallstreetbets,"Similar things was said about Tesla being dominant player. Look at where NIO is now.

If you have the best products. And most market share. You will dominant the market. Same thing with AMD vs Intel. Intel was amazing at first then AMD came on top. We are all speculating. 

What puts TLRY at the top for me. Is the CEO. And his board of directors. Privateer holding investments. Also Sweetwater brewery they own in Georgia. And Manitoba Harvest. That is being sold at Costco and Amazon. Ratings fantastic. 5 stars! 

Don’t get me wrong I’m also invested in MSOS ETF. But TLRY is my favorite"
2021-06-28 22:41:58,wallstreetbets,You’re the delusional one.
2021-06-28 22:58:38,wallstreetbets,"Yeah we have a long time before the US markets are saturated to the point where they match Canada. Imagine Canada is a single state (Population is roughly the same as California). While each state legalizes, there is a long process of scaling and obtaining licenses to grow and distribute. Canada is a mature market, like California is, but each state that legalizes is still in it's infancy. Eventually the best brands will win, but the US has many years before that really happens.

Also, I'd like to note that Illinois, which is starting to become known as the Silicon Valley of Weed, has been outperforming Canada in revenues and tax dollars. That's very important because Illinois is only the 5th most populated US state. Americans love their weed."

Insurance companies don't absorb costs.  No companies do.  What they do is pass the costs onto their customers.  It's the people who end up paying for the drugs, in the form of higher premiums.  It has to be; there is no other source of money in the system."
2021-06-28 22:13:50,wallstreetbets,"Healthcare plan premiums aren’t that sensitive to the market of drug prices. Sure eventually some plans could see a raise, but with low use drugs like daraprim there wouldn’t be that much demand on insurance companies to justify overall plan hikes (most are based on a corporate/employer level)."
2021-06-28 20:12:20,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, except, as I stated, if you didn't have insurance, you were given a rebate that lowered the price to normal. You were better off not having insurance in that case.

2021-06-28 22:17:31,wallstreetbets,"It all adds up.  At the end of the day the actuaries figure out what their expenses are going to be for the year, they tack on some percentage for the profit they want to make, divide by the number of people in the plan, and those are your premiums.  

The fact that it's spread out between many customers and averages out to a small amount per customer doesn't mean that the customers aren't paying.  If I take 3 dollars from everyone in the US, it's only $3, but I'm still a billionaire."

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"10 Reasons Why This Week's Krispy Kreme IPO is SUS AF Hello I am an Ivy League economics major who chronic masturbates and has daddy issues. Please see below my thoughts on Krispy Kreme, which will be listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker DNUT later this week:

1. Unprofitable for the last three years
2. Saddled with over $1B of debt from being taken private in 2016
3. The list price will be between $21-$24 a share, giving the company a nearly $4B valuation. This is a 4x return for the Private Equity owners that took it private for $1B. 400% return in 5 years? What is this, a tech company?
4. Most of the \~$500M of IPO proceeds will be used up to extinguish debt and compensate executives. In fact, executives are in line to receive about $50M, or 10% of the proceeds. The company will buy shares off the executives and also pay their taxes on vested stock grants. Does that sound like a company with a lot of growth ahead?
5. The Private Equity holding company will own 84.4% of shares after the IPO. They plan to distribute over two thirds of those shares to existing minority investors. Sounds like a pump and dump
6. Cash flow is negligible when it is not negative
7. Only has $50M in cash but the most recent annual loss was $60M
8. We are in the middle of a historic bull market that is popularly mischaracterized as being driven by a meme stock retail trader frenzy. Companies will naturally try to take advantage of this
9. Private Equity IPOs are almost always a cash grab
10. Red sus

Krispy Kreme are decent donuts, but more than I like to pay. Last time I went a dozen was $14, but you have to pay $1 for each of the good donuts on top of that. Our local grocery store has ok donuts, but they’re super cheap. The real winner is our local small business donut shop. Great flavor at a reasonable cost. You can even get a chocolate bar with Seattle Seahawks colored sprinkles. So damn good.

It fell for the rest of the day and now a few weeks later (or more) it's at 24.

2021-06-28 23:34:20,wallstreetbets,I have no interest in losing money on this. Better off just wasting your money on their donuts and at least you'd have 40 lbs and dyuhbeetus to show for it in the end.
2021-06-28 23:41:48,wallstreetbets,Do people still like those micro Krispy Kreme donuts?
2021-06-28 23:43:30,wallstreetbets,They can easily turn this around if they only open shops next to dispensaries
2021-06-28 23:47:33,wallstreetbets,Wow thats actually insane.
2021-06-28 23:51:27,wallstreetbets,Reason 11) their donuts are garbage.
2021-06-28 23:54:37,wallstreetbets,"Lol, I got that email from fidelity about this shit this week, and I seriously was like FUD bitch delete"
2021-06-28 23:59:41,wallstreetbets,DNKN is shit. DeezNUTs. Enough said.
2021-06-29 00:09:01,wallstreetbets,DD looks kinda long so gotta be good. Going in for 100 tomorrow
2021-06-29 00:09:27,wallstreetbets,"Oh shit, I had no idea they were in trouble. I thought they stopped giving out donuts because of Covid"
2021-06-29 00:10:22,wallstreetbets,That’s a baker’s dozen per American at $4b market cap. I like calls here
2021-06-29 00:31:57,wallstreetbets,I believe this is how the 1% signals to one another that the game is over and time to sell out. Not financial advise
2021-06-29 00:33:13,wallstreetbets,You must be new here. Donuts are tech now
2021-06-29 00:33:24,wallstreetbets,If they brought back Nutella donuts than maybe…
2021-06-29 00:44:22,wallstreetbets,Ticker is bullish tho🦍
2021-06-29 00:49:14,wallstreetbets,One Luckin please

2021-06-29 01:01:46,wallstreetbets,"imma buy me some calls then, see how that works out"
2021-06-29 01:05:51,wallstreetbets,Fck Krispy Kreme. They opened one up literally right next to a small mom and pop donut shop in the same shopping mall that’s been in business for 20 years. Landlord is a total dick for allowing that to happen.
2021-06-29 01:07:26,wallstreetbets,Isn’t this the company that was caught cooking the books years ago?

2021-06-29 01:29:51,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like a good stock to buy puts on. Unless a bunch of retards prop it up because, donuts."

Can’t cost them much to make these donuts but they sure do love to give them away. And I’m all for free donuts!!!"
2021-06-29 02:22:13,wallstreetbets,KK will have to sell billions of donuts per week to break even. Not worth the risk.

Your argument is invalidated"
2021-06-29 02:32:05,wallstreetbets,They should merge with Weight Watchers for synergies.
2021-06-29 02:32:55,wallstreetbets,agreed.  get the doughnut out of here and buy puts as soon as the chain is out.
2021-06-29 02:33:52,wallstreetbets,Smells like a Levis?

Ipo are made to help raise money from growth. What growth will this company get. I believe the pandemic hit them pretty hard and they tryna raise money to avoid closing restaurants across the us."

2021-06-29 06:38:41,wallstreetbets,"Dude I totally agree lol, I saw this and didn't even look at the excess debt it probably received from going private. If this stock has any hold at that level that will be crazy. It is absolutely not worth that, this is clearly the private equity holders trying to riddle Krispy Kreme with debt and get out with huge profits. I hope the IPO fails and it sinks into the abyss. I don't get how this IPO can even be a real thing."
2021-06-29 06:48:41,wallstreetbets,Yeh
2021-06-29 06:57:40,wallstreetbets,Sugary foods are less and less popular due to the health risks so long term it’s a terrible business

2021-06-29 07:32:28,wallstreetbets,The value of both the doughnuts and these shares will decrease at about the same rate over the first few weeks.
2021-06-29 07:33:18,wallstreetbets,Anything private equity touches becomes a shit show for employees. I wish they’d all drop dead.

I was going to get a coffee and a breakfast sandwich but the coffee was overpriced and they didn’t have any breakfast sandwiches. If they updated their menu and it wasn’t overpriced bullshit I would probably be a regular, but I will not be going back unless I get a boner for fresh Krispy Kreme’s which isn’t very common."
2021-06-29 07:47:52,wallstreetbets,So can you short the stock on day one to try and take advantage?

2021-06-29 08:26:17,wallstreetbets,"Short it on the IPO. Or wait for the hedges to naked shorts it 140%, and turn it into the next GME."
2021-06-29 08:47:14,wallstreetbets,Back in. 2000 my dad killed it with Krispy Kreme but I think it's a mess ..want no part of it
2021-06-29 08:50:52,wallstreetbets,the question is.... why the ipo. what's going on with the donuts?
2021-06-29 09:01:53,wallstreetbets,Agreed.  This is yet another corporate equity scam.  I feel like investors are starting to tire of bailing out shitty CEOs.

2021-06-29 10:30:52,wallstreetbets,"I hold an MS of Psychology and an MBA not from Ivy League stock, but I can tell you not to buy this stock because their doughnuts are 80% air and taste like ass.  Doughnut shops are first judged by two criteria:  

1. Their apple fritters 

2.  Amount of fat/lard/grease you have to scrape off the roof of your mouth after you finish your doughnut

Krispy Kreme fails at both of these criteria.  That is all the DD you need to know.  

PS: Not financial advice, but you can go fuck yourself.  You are welcome."

2021-06-29 11:24:49,wallstreetbets,"I wish we had more counter-DD like this. This is brilliant, great job bud.

Now it makes sense... I've been seeing KK stuff all over social media lately (not just investment-related). Seems they're looking to recruit a bunch of bagholders by blasting the airwaves with their brand. Interesting, since they'll still get a healthy return even if the marketing campaign fails to win over enough new customers and drive revenue."
2021-06-29 11:31:44,wallstreetbets,they got some pretty good Dnuts tho
2021-06-29 11:47:16,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a desperate attempt to fleece the flock
2021-06-29 12:24:33,wallstreetbets,"My only counter is that KK donuts are waaayyy better than the competition.  I still remember when they opened one in the student union--like twenty years ago now.  I had never tasted a donut that good, and I wasn't even stoned. 

Mr. Donut is a strong contender. I'm not sure they have locations outside Japan though. There *are* KK's in Japan I've heard, but I never found one when I lived there."
2021-06-29 12:30:11,wallstreetbets,Free Doughnuts for all you vaccinated tendie eaters.

2021-06-28 20:11:25,wallstreetbets,But they’re giving away free donuts to vaxtards. That’s gotta be profitable right ?
2021-06-29 00:32:46,wallstreetbets,Counter argument: donut good
2021-06-28 21:16:03,wallstreetbets,Post\_market?
2021-06-28 21:28:37,wallstreetbets,I feel like every time I have stayed away from an IPO because it's overvalued I've watched on the sidelines as it's mooned. The one exception to this is COIN.

2021-06-29 07:53:58,wallstreetbets,"KKD was a wild ride. But it also showed the appetite public markets have for companies with broad appeal. I can already see the Motley Fool / CNBC headline, “Own the Next Starbucks Now” or “Doughnuts are the Next Meme Stock.” Just because the fundamentals on Krispy Kreme are sus, that’s no guarantee it won’t get pumped. It’s actually quite bullish that PE is behind this IPO since you know they’re up to no good. Might as well ride it up and just make sure to leave before the party is over."

Now, if the company said proceeds were going to be opening a bunch of new stores to maximize their profits going forward, then it might make sense to sell a small stake to raise capital.

That is not this."

2021-06-28 20:13:36,wallstreetbets,"It’s all relative right? 

I made a little bit on the Roblox IPO, it got some momentum day one. That’s actually been a good buy and hold for a lot of people so far. Good for them. I wish I had held it.

I thought the Coin DPO was going to be a hot mess and it was an OK day one, but yeah quickly went downhill. I think it’s getting close to a good entry point now, though. 

I bought A little AirBNB day one, sold it for some tendies a while ago. it’s doing OK still, considering buying in again."
2021-06-28 22:32:10,wallstreetbets,HA
2021-06-28 22:06:47,wallstreetbets,Very true. Restaurants have famously low margins as well. It’s hard to really see the value in anyone that’s not as scaled up and ubiquitous as McDonalds or Dominos
2021-06-28 23:09:39,wallstreetbets,This SPAC boom is such a blatant money grab. But I get downvoted for saying it

2021-06-29 06:40:23,wallstreetbets,Thanks for chiming in. I suspected that this was the case. I instantly mistrust SPACs for not IPOing the normal way. There definitely will be a moment of truth where retail investors are wiped

2021-06-28 23:22:46,wallstreetbets,Jesus bro get a therapist or go to rehab or something. It’s not good to invest with an unhealthy mindset. Best of luck to you
2021-06-28 23:44:37,wallstreetbets,Can confirm. There used to be a combination KFC/Taco Bell next to my dispensary.
2021-06-29 00:33:35,wallstreetbets,"Close but not quite.

It’s just that there will be a lot of shitty IPOs whenever the market is in a bubble. And we’re definitely in one now"

I was trying to figure how they could justify that much good will, assumed foot traffic has been down/dead and want to make sure that habit gets reinstilled post pandemic. Now that I see Op’s list of pump and dumps I’d add that they ran this promo to juice gross product and customer numbers.

2021-06-29 00:12:03,wallstreetbets,"Came to west coast from the east coast and was sad to find there were no Dunkins here. One day, I saw a sign on my commute with DD logo. I was so excited by the expansion—both because I wanted donuts and by prospect of buying shares before millions of Californians like me lined up for munchkins—that I bought 100 shares for $34 each when I got to work. I held up the acquisition and 4x'd my money. I feel like I would have 10x'd by 2025 if the company stayed public. Great company with large margins and brand loyalty."

Investing is great, especially if your life sucks. The small wins help my day. 
With that being said, I don't win often and I don't invest more than I can lose (not much). But, you never learn if you don't actually do it so I'm slowly doing it and maybe one day I'll be a tenth of as rich as some other retards.

2021-06-28 21:31:12,wallstreetbets,I'm not going to buy in. I tend towards being a value investor. I'm just registering the fact that it's going to sail up because I'm not buying in.
2021-06-29 15:58:02,wallstreetbets,expected more from a person of your pedigree. when you're finished citing authorities you can enjoy working for MBAs who have complete knowledge of econ from their 202 macro course they took in 1987

Coffee is fine and donuts are fine but nothing special, they are just everywhere in mass, and just unavoidable and inevitable. The person who said Kane’s knows what is up although I feel their quality declined when they expanded on rte one."
2021-06-28 21:31:45,wallstreetbets,"Dunkin sucks. Their donuts go stale in about 5 min, which is faster than a go round behind the Wendy’s. Krispy Kreme donuts are superior in literally every way. Idk anything about the financials, but I know which donuts I want to put in my face."

2021-06-28 21:53:55,wallstreetbets,Fuck all ya'll Dunkin is way better. They're sandwiches are bomb the last time I had an egg sandwich from SBUX I had to take a whole bottle of ranitidine washed down with coffee so hot I needed to squirt a whole tube of Bengay in my mouth which put me in the ER because methyl salicylate is fucking toxic and now I'm dead
2021-06-28 22:28:27,wallstreetbets,"A lot of people love their coffee, especially on the east coast"
2021-06-28 23:02:28,wallstreetbets,Wild because all the kks are gone here and we only have dunkin and T H now

2021-06-28 23:51:34,wallstreetbets,I like their coffee but you’re right their donuts blow.
2021-06-29 02:47:39,wallstreetbets,"Agree with this take.  DD Donuts are not good, and the coffee is just laden with sugar.  They got booted from California years ago, we just forgot the reason and welcomed them back."

2021-06-28 23:28:18,wallstreetbets,"That's what happens. Expand and get worse, stay small and make no money. DD was actually good at one point.

Big brain coffee in NE is marylous."
2021-06-28 23:08:37,wallstreetbets,"This is all just from my observations so I could be talking out of my ass but:
- Dunkin doesn't appear to make their actual donuts on site. I don't notice them ""going"" stale because they're already stale at the window. On the plus hand it doesn't matter what time of day I go they're about the same level of freshness.
- This means they are likely more profitable than Krispy Kreme because they don't have deal with the cost of making donuts on site fresh. Don't sell them all? I'm pretty damn sure the DDs I go to save them for the next day. 
- DDs are goddamn everywhere and I think they're all franchises (I mean licensed, not actually owned and operated by the company) so corporate can ensure they make a profit off of licenses fees and selling supplies to franchise owners. If the place is unprofitable, the owner takes the hit not DD. 
-Actual owners are stingy with everything to save money. The one closest to me will give you zero napkins with your donuts unless you specifically ask. If you ask they give you like 2-3. I can't imagine what else they're doing to cut costs if napkins are an issue. 
- KK lines are always long and slow in my experience. I'm not stopping at KK on my way to work unless I'm leaving early and making a whole trip of it because there's not that many of them. DDs are everywhere and I can get in and out of drive through fast"
2021-06-28 21:41:17,wallstreetbets,Ya.. like how dafaq are donuts like that unprofitable?
2021-06-28 22:10:03,wallstreetbets,">I want to put in my face

Looks like  you don’t know what’s the hole in the donut is for."
2021-06-28 23:11:41,wallstreetbets,"You're right, Dunkin is straight ass, but KK are hardly better. Up here in the PNW, Legendary Doughnuts is where it's at. Their donuts are fantastic on their own, and they also make grilled donut paninis with toppings like pulled pork or buffalo chicken. Best drunk/hangover food ever."
2021-06-28 21:50:32,wallstreetbets,"You're underestimating a few things: convenience, cost and complexity. There have been plenty of times I've gone to DD simply because it was more convenient than what I typically preferred. Blue Bottle got a massive line? Guess I'll go to Dunkins. Starbucks closed by 7 pm and it's 11? Guess I'll go to Dunkins (24 hours). Falling asleep at the wheel and need to a drive thru? Guess I'll go to Dunkins (so few drive thru Starbucks). 

And as far as cost, there are many, many people who live in MA who don't live in a zip code where million dollar homes are commonplace. For these people, the cost of a coffee elsewhere is prohibitively expensive. ""Coffee shouldn't be expensive,"" is a common complaint.

Finally, complexity. Some people simply can't handle choices. They want to order a ""Coffee. Regular."" and anything demanding more from them is a huge challenge. These are common folk, remember. And by definition, there are more of them."

2021-06-28 23:26:41,wallstreetbets,"Because it's DD or Starbucks for chain coffee. Both have shit coffee and shit food. DD is at least cheap.

Seriously, don't try and tell me Starbucks has good coffee. Their blonde roast is OK, everything else is garbanzo coffee."
2021-06-28 21:39:42,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely, I got a dark roast coffee for a meeting today. Sipped it, instant regret, felt like they filtered an entire bag of their shitty coffee into that one cup. I went back later, complained, and got a free latte with vanilla."

2021-06-29 02:06:13,wallstreetbets,"I love Dunkin's sandwiches but I don't think I've ever had more consistently inconsistent coffee in my entire life. I make my own cold brew now and despite not measuring anything it tastes just about the same every single time.

Their coffee though? I do not get coffee there anymore. Every time it's different, and most of the time it's bad and I can't even finish a medium.

Starbucks is consistent but it's too expensive. If I'm in a rush I'll just stop in a gas station and get a big cup for like a dollar and it's almost always good."

2021-06-29 01:48:19,wallstreetbets,"Depends where you are..  
If you are in the legit suburbs Dunkin makes them on site.  
If you are in a city with more than 1.5 milli or so they have dedicated factories making the donuts.  
  
This is not always true but a good standard to go on."
2021-06-29 09:12:42,wallstreetbets,"When i was in college I would always walk to the DD on Sunday nights, because they straight up would give me all their donuts. Dude said they just throw them out after that anyways. So from that I always inferred they kept them in the case for 7 days. But I didn’t really mind, they only tastes slightly more hard and stale than their “fresh” ones. But I would go to DD to refill my large $0.99 promo cup of coffee, and he would just pile donuts into paper sacks and hand them to me for free."
2021-06-28 23:14:27,wallstreetbets,DD can be shoved into an old janitors closet and be a functioning store. KK needs a fuckin stand alone location in a god damn strip mall that's 10 miles away from your house. Fat fucks that eat fried shit ain't going that far out there way to get it and that's all the DD anyone should need on this steaming pile of an ipo.
2021-06-28 23:45:01,wallstreetbets,You'd need a micropenis for KK donuts.

DD is... Eh. It does the job I suppose.

I came across the below short interest article that I believe explains what has been crushing Novonix stock in the U.S. NVNXF and ASX: NVX in a simular fashion when growth as the only American, Canadian, and Austrailian battery manufacturing competition with China. It's time to crush the Shorts that have no business in the stock of a company that is actually working with almost all EV and Microgrid suppliers to make up for the forthcomming gap when China cuts off supply to the U.S. to support their own EV growth. Also, the Shorts are keeping the stock from organically meeting the $4 per share requirment to uplist on the NASDAQ. See below.

Novonix Limited (OTCMKTS:NVNXF) saw a large increase in short interest during the month of June. As of June 15th, there was short interest totalling 118,300 shares, an increase of 885.8% from the May 31st total of 12,000 shares. Based on an average daily volume of 414,700 shares, the days-to-cover ratio is currently 0.3 days.

Shares of OTCMKTS:NVNXF traded up $0.01 during trading on Monday, reaching $1.80. The stock had a trading volume of 151,200 shares, compared to its average volume of 740,221. Novonix has a 52 week low of $0.61 and a 52 week high of $4.85. The business’s fifty day moving average is $1.72.

2021-06-28 20:02:22,wallstreetbets,I believe they've already cut everything from the infrastructure bill that would have any positive impact on WKHS unless they plan on building passenger buses but WKHS is still challenging the USPS contract decision.
2021-06-28 20:01:26,wallstreetbets,"You don't know what is actually going to be announced and neither do I. The fact is, you don't need to be right about the results of an announcement to push the value of a stock and profit from it. The speculation of WKHS being given a contract is enough to bump the price in the short term and could lead to a higher price-point consolidation. Look at Viac which jumped in price today purely from speculation of a potential Comcast merger which was solely based on rumors and not a news piece nor announcement.    

And if WKHS does in fact get some new contracts as a direct result of the infrastructure announcements, the stock price and options values of holders will quite literally grow exponentially given that WKHS has THE highest SI rate of any stock in the market and is one of the most discussed/trending stocks in media right now . WKHS just needs ONE great catalyst before they destroy wall street like AMC and GME have been doing. I bought a few calls because why not? The upside is HUGE and my losses are limited."

2021-06-29 11:49:38,wallstreetbets,"I agree that he absolutely isn't progressive, and no one is honestly implying that.  Clarence Thomas isn't bringing this up to support black liberation, and I SINCERELY doubt he would support pardons for those imprisoned for nonviolent drug charges. Hell would freeze over before that idiot puppet did something right. Fuck, he can barely express an opinion for himself, and I'm sure the one thing both sides can agree on is that he's a political appointee, present only to put an ass in a seat.  

Which means that no, it really isn't that simple. 

The idea that conservatives want a small government is 100% propaganda, especially when the military budget is so high and they are - quite effectively - shoving religious anti-abortion laws down everyone's throats, to pick two obvious examples out of many.  The enforcement of systemic racism is another, but guess what - centrists, democrats, and liberals are too.  It's called ""systemic"" for a reason. 

Anyone telling you otherwise is a gullible sucker.

Politics is always about wealth, power, and control. Period. 

Racism is a different topic than what I think you're trying to imply, so don't use that as a straw man argument.  Minorities can and will enforce that systemic racism for their own personal benefit (as personal harm reduction), but that's a different conversation and frankly, I cannot trust that you're ready for that."

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o7quuj/tlry/

I brought up that we would PR’s this week from big media like CNBC for marijuana. Sure enough, there was one today:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/06/28/supreme-court-justice-clarence-thomas-says-federal-marijuana-laws-may-be-outdated-.html

I think $TLRY has the potential to 5x from its current price. Tomorrow, like I mentioned before, the full house committee is looking at the fiscal 2022 bill which includes allowing banks to work with marijuana companies without any penalty to the bank as well as allowing marijuana sales in DC! This is a MASSIVE catalyst for the industry. Did I mention that the fiscal bill has to be passed before September 30th because it is the end of the governments fiscal year? I want to help fellow Apes, so I will keep shouting this from the roof tops!

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMC and gme hedge against a crash ( easiest money thank me later ) I carefully  looked into amc and gme for the past few months  but paid even more attention these last 2 weeks  I’ve noticed that amc and gmes prices are heavily influenced by the market and they always do
The inverse of what the market does at least as of the past couple weeks ( charts are out there just look at the sp 500 3x bear for a better view) , also keep in mind both amc and gme are mostly owned by retail shareholders who have the motto to hold so its makes the scenario  a little nicer. Both  amc and gme  will explode in a crash due to them having a negative beta , and negative beta stocks tend to do the opposite of the market , with the amount of volume we are seeing with amc we could see amc sky rocket and if that happens that will 100 percent cause hedge funds to cover their shorts , now with that being said do ur own DD but I believe holding amc or gme can save u from getting fuvked in a crash as this is the easiest money u will ever make , thank me later I’m retarded so don’t ask about punctuation or whatever"

2021-06-28 21:10:01,wallstreetbets,"Both of those of those are highly volatile with super expensive options, so whether or not they always move against the market (they don't) they would not make good choices to protect you from a crash.

A lot of big money has been purchasing puts on HYG. Look at their price chart zoomed out as far as it will allow you to. Notice that it has been trading sideways for 14 years, except on 2 occasions (without even looking, you should be able to guess the years).  Volatility on something like this is very low, as are its option prices. $1000 worth of the right puts could easily get you 80K if we see a crash like we did in 2008 or 2020.

I'm sure there are 100 better plays out there if you take the time to look, but GME and AMC are probably the absolute worst (for this purpose... nothing wrong with being long on GME). Don't pay a premium for super expensive puts on SPY or calls on these for a situation that you're hoping will never happen."
2021-06-28 21:26:40,wallstreetbets,Just do what I do and short the triple short. But what y’all know about that
2021-06-29 11:27:10,wallstreetbets,It’s not a hedge against a market crash this got posted a few weeks ago. explain to me why anyone would buy gme and amc during a crash as opposed to puts on everything and calls on VIX which is a literall indicator that shows how shit the market is. VIX calls in a crash is guaranteed money same for puts on most things. why would anyone risk buying amc or gme when the only thing to go off of is “it moved against the market for a few weeks.”?
2021-06-28 22:44:32,wallstreetbets,"Its possible that this happens on a market downturn, where margins see more pressure because of less liquidation value and thus a higher maintenance margin in an account, and algos might hedge some of their short positions to try and avoid a margin call or to keep more cash on hand and play the actual downturn to catch the falling knife, or possibly both…but in any case, your observation is something that is quite formidable, and I wonder what the next downturn will hold 🤣"

The beta tells us that GME traded inverse to the market in the past (of course it did do you remember the big January spike?).

It doesn’t mean that if the market crashes that GME will shoot up.

Besides, if you change the timeframe to the past few weeks or months it doesn’t have a negative beta.

If the market crashes I’m sure GME will also crash. Unless the market crashes BECAUSE there is a market-wide sell-off that flows into GME. Seems unlikely."

So we're there. Before it increased damn near 100-fold but no one was on the hook to close short positions like they are in this case.

You're going to look back and find the only thing that limited profits was each person's belief in what ""a lot"" looks like.

And to top all this off, let's see who the institutional owners of Centricus are... Oh look, there's only one: Citadel Advisors LLC. CEO and Founder of Citadel: Kenneth Griffin (of course). 

If you are even slightly aware of what's been going on these past six months, you should know that this is all bad bad news for you and AMC. Do your own research, don't take my word for it. I'm not giving anyone financial advice.

The 0.1% are all working together to stay the 0.1%, to the direct detriment of humanity as a whole, and of the earth at large. The amount of good a billionaire could do with their money is astronomical, and yet they choose to hoard it and amass more and more."

2021-06-29 00:15:21,wallstreetbets,But... But... Free popcorn...
2021-06-29 10:33:00,wallstreetbets,"This is just a speculative post, but:  it appears to me that the point of the 0.1% hoarding their money is because it's the only way for the $ to retain it's value. What I mean is, as the govt prints money at a mind-bending, neck-snapping pace, you'd think ""hey, if I'm a billionaire, I can buy whatever I want!""  NO!  If they did that, they'd be putting those $s back in the market which would devalue them in the sense that others get to use those $s.  But if NOBODY gets to use those $s, then what amount of $s are actually in the market have MORE value.  It's still fake wealth because the $ is backed by nothing but faith, BUT holding said $s seems to be effective at keeping the faith value of $ up.

Please correct me if I'm wrong about this, as it's a theory of mine & I'm no expert.  I do take value in learning where I'm wrong."

2021-06-29 00:41:26,wallstreetbets,Why I say buy $WKHS
2021-06-28 22:49:41,wallstreetbets,They’ve already increased supply from like 200m to 500m over the past year. I don’t understand how amc is in the same category as gme after that much dilution.
2021-06-28 21:00:39,wallstreetbets,Selling what? They just sold 45mil shares lmao.
2021-06-28 21:23:35,wallstreetbets,Was he asking what you said he asked or was he asked about how much money was insured? Because there’s a big difference
2021-06-28 22:51:30,wallstreetbets,Bro if you go on the amc subreddit they actually aren’t able to tell which ones are meme shitpost made up quotes from Warren Buffet of real ones lol
2021-06-29 03:55:58,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I'm already way above the SIPC limit on my brokerage, it would be safer to move all the meme stocks to another one"
2021-06-29 08:17:35,wallstreetbets,Lol no.
2021-06-29 05:34:30,wallstreetbets,"The problem is statistics.

Most of you are going to lose your money... like a LOT of you... normally I don't give a shit. But this thing is toxic and it literally fucks me off."
2021-06-28 20:30:55,wallstreetbets,"the market is at all time highs, and AMC is only a couple pts off. Where is this reverse correlation, the 1 minute chart?"
2021-06-28 22:34:33,wallstreetbets,"So,Enoch called for a newb? 😎"
2021-06-28 21:08:11,wallstreetbets,I'm just talking about what was available at the time. Either number is stupidly high and the easiest investing decision ever.
2021-06-28 22:14:23,wallstreetbets,What was it then? Gme has been getting shorted for years and to me looks like he bought the bottom.
2021-06-29 01:03:33,wallstreetbets,Damn you’re really that out of the loop huh?
2021-06-28 23:31:33,wallstreetbets,We can agree to disagree but AMC is nothing like GME
2021-06-28 20:54:01,wallstreetbets,"Buddy even if the charts support what you’re saying the timescale is so limited it’s useless info. You could be right, but you’re just making wild guesses. This is a garbage post with no real info. Useless."
2021-06-28 21:09:58,wallstreetbets,Yea. Good luck. In 3 years AMC will be out of business LOL
2021-06-29 01:42:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, they are figuratively lighting the whole world on fire so they can keep their mountain of treasure. A dragon is a good metaphor."
2021-06-29 01:11:15,wallstreetbets,I love you too stranger! Knowledge is power :)
2021-06-29 02:41:26,wallstreetbets,you guys remember when a a ron tried to put “please let me issue another 500 million shares” on the last ballot?  ha!
2021-06-29 06:14:51,wallstreetbets,free popcorn though
2021-06-28 23:07:36,wallstreetbets,Honestly that's all the DD I need. Even at 100% shorted they could cover from share offering alone.
2021-06-28 23:43:02,wallstreetbets,So this is where the shills hang out now?
2021-06-29 12:12:04,wallstreetbets,"You should consider Fidelity if the insurance is important to you.  They have $1B in insurance with no per-customer security limits, that would kick in when SIPC insurance is exhausted.  There is a $1.9M per-customer cash limit (is addition to the $250k SIPC limit for cash)"
2021-06-28 21:14:22,wallstreetbets,"Look at the daily charts for both sp500 and amc , from there u will be able to connect the dots"
2021-06-29 01:12:40,wallstreetbets,With wsb conspiracy theories?
2021-06-28 20:54:56,wallstreetbets,I’m making a wild educated guess*
2021-06-28 23:30:11,wallstreetbets,Not if they keep diluting and letting the idiots keep buying up all the shares
2021-06-29 12:42:49,wallstreetbets,I wish we could talk irl. I'd abosrb so much knowledge it feels like.
2021-06-29 07:22:03,wallstreetbets,😂😂 tempting yeah
2021-06-29 02:20:24,wallstreetbets,"Yes.

That is why I don't get why PPL just keep saying AMC.

GME is the squeeze play and WKHS has just joined the party."
2021-06-29 12:17:59,wallstreetbets,"Vanguard also has a similar thing, but it's not exactly the same because there's a total cap on all claims, which makes it a bit worse in the event of shit hitting the fan"
2021-06-28 20:56:20,wallstreetbets,"There is nothing “educated” about anything you posted. It’s fine to be excited, but don’t confuse what you’re doing as actionable DD. You’re just on a bandwagon"
2021-06-29 09:35:29,wallstreetbets,WKHS has like 630mil shares in their float too lmao
2021-06-29 12:25:53,wallstreetbets,Fidelity's insurance policy is for $1B.  That's a total cap on all claims (it's not $1B per customer) so I think it's similar.
2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Thoughts on this SPX Yolo? Tits up? ☠️🥳💳🤩📻🔋👀 
2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Does $Body's 'coach' network hurt their chances of success? As it seems, $BODY started trading today in the hopes they are the Netflix of workouts. 

But does have a pyramid scheme structure with tens of thousands of coaches hurt them? These 'coaches' are not only out of shape, but one of these top coaches killed their oxygen-dependent preemie during their drug and alcohol filled birthday party, stolen peoples families pets and almost killed them, preyed on vulnerable women during pregnancy and postpartum to make more money. They have even told off people when asking real questions. These coaches also balked at covid warnings and would constantly travel in groups and not follow mandates, and boast that covid was not real. There have also been multiple concerns about these coaches pushing shakeology and more to consumers who should not be using the products. There are multiple times coaches do not add disclaimers to posts and lie to get people interested. 

Do these indiscretions bode well for their business in the long run to have all these people who are supposed to be spokespeople act unprofessionally? Does this signal the end of the coaching network since they are now public? 

I am really curious how the coaching network can be good for a public company based on how unhealthy and unhinged a lot of the coaches are."

2021-06-28 23:49:09,wallstreetbets,"Just a little motivation for you fellas.

I started investing at almost 28 years old. I only had 3-4k to my name. I couldnt save, had a money drenching girlfriend who I believed I'd marry. I lost my job due to COVID last May.

Fast forward to today I have $83,000 invested, I'm moving to NYC in a amazing spot and getting promoted at the company that hired me 7 mo ago. I am also seeking new jobs because my resume looks attractive from where I'm at and always look for the salary bump. 

My girlfriend dumped me 4 months ago and I felt like the biggest loser. She doubted me. She wanted money. She mistreated me and I let it happen. 

I have more motivation than ever in my life now at 29. About to live on my own and looking to finally get a successful career running. Lost 15 lbs since breakup while getting my muscle back from when I lifted in college and in the best shape of my life.

None of this happens if I'm still in a relationship with her. I would be in the same loophole, never move, never hungry for a higher position/salary.

I might be late to the party but dont ever fucking let a significant other be the main part of your life. Its you. Focus on you and your +1 should be the bonus. 

I learned the hard way but internally I am so happy with the transition I made these past few months and try my best not to regret wasting most of my time and energy on someone I really really loved that didnt love me back. It was a 4 year relationship.

Get on and fuck the shorts."

Trader 2: Options are probably about half if not 75 percent of the market, an OPTIONS Trader is just as an important player as your everyday stock holder. 

Trader 3: Options affect more of the stock then the whole market itself.

2021-06-28 21:48:30,wallstreetbets,"Options Trading Rules:

You are smarter than everyone else. Don’t do what they all say to do. The majority of people don’t beat the market.

Leg into a position of the course of a month. 40% week 1, 30% week 2, 20% Week 3, 10% Week 4

Wait for sad days to start legging.

NEVER open a position at market open. Wait until 10:30am. Close position spikes at market open.

Never try and catch a failing knife. If you missed the big spike, then move on.

But-to-open calls/puts with a 3 month timeframe to minimize theta exposure. Close between 30-45DTE

Do not buy-to-open, long-term option contracts before earnings, volatility is too high and the theta decay will most likely burn you.

Sell-to-open options on volatile and liquid stocks with a high IV Rank with 30-45 days till expiration and close at 10-21 DTE respectively 

Close at 50% if before 1/2 the DTE for max profit per day

Invest profits (from long and short positions) into a fund like SCHW for each quarter

Sell-to-open calls against your long calls and LEAPS (PMCC) at 90% probability with the minimum strike being the breakeven of the LEAP

Buy a SPY LEAPS if you fuck up. Sell PMCC against your SPY LEAPS. If you have under 25k, just trade SPY LEAPS and do PMCCs. Open 1 per quarter if you can afford it. Close at 50-100% gain"

2021-06-28 21:57:09,wallstreetbets,r/CLOV
2021-06-28 22:20:12,wallstreetbets,"Depends on the speed that it is going up.

Suppose XYZ is trading at $100. If you buy an XYZ call for $110 a month out, and the price gets all the way up to $110 on the day of expiration, then that contract is worth a whopping $0. Conversely, if you had paid the extra money for at ATM call, then you'd be $1,000 richer.

Buying OTM only works when the stock goes far beyond your strike before expiration. Buying ATM is good for capturing momentum as it happens. Buying ITM is essentially the same as a leveraged position. For stocks/markets in a long steady rise, it usually works to buy ATM and roll up as the trend continues."

If you aint planning on doing anything to earn that income regularly, add up your yearly income for 75 years, then if you have that in the bank (a bit less in fact) you should be well  covered.

OR work out what lump sum you need to have in the bank so your current yearly income is paid just as interest on that lump sum.  That's always fun,  I've tried it with a couple of jobs ""what would I need in the bank to get monthly interest same as my monthly pay today?""

However this Reddit page also has been known to have some 🌈🧸’s but they haven’t been around recently as they may have blown their accounts by buying puts and having the 🌈🧸 mindset saying, “NVDA & SHOP can’t go any higher or TSLA back to 400 like Burry said”. But at the end of the day, they are only 🌈🧸’s and no one gives a shit about valuations or inflation because it’s all a fairy tale and none of it matters because you buy the stocks you like.

At 10AM we get an email the Cafeteria would not be serving lunch because they did not have a protocol in place. 

Ordered tacos for lunch and see the market just dumping ass all day. My boss came to the breakroom and said we're probably going to be WFH for a while and that they didn't want us taking our monitors and shit, so if we want to take our monitors we need to sneak them out now before they start checking.

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Long time $wish investor (from IPO) exiting entire position - discussion. I have been one of the early investors in wish, long time bag holder and promoter of the stock on this forum, I was having a considerable position in wish, today however I decided to reduce the position to zero shares. 

Paper handed or not, I felt the obligation to be transparant about it. I still believe $wish could potentially shoot higher and achieve its average analyst price target of 18+ short term, 

for me currently it’s to much volatility and uncertainty, I’m not a meme investor.

Furthermore there are lot of issues with the core market activities , counterfeit goods , 70% of EU sales starting 1th of July will be submitted to additional fees and value added tax (+21% on sales price)making the sold items via wish much less competitive vis a vis local e-commerce players in Europe who already are paying the VAT. 

Uncertainty regarding the postal agreement between China and USA , looking at the tensions , a brake in this agreement could put the entire business model of context logic under pressure , making local stores and e-commerce much more attractive.

Context Logic biggest market is Europe, the European Union have strict product quality and consumer goods safety directives (ce) , they recently did a study checking into items randomly via e-commerce platforms like wish, the study found that more then 80% of the products the commission examined from wish were not meeting the safety and quality that are set forth in the directive, hence should forbid them from arriving into European families as they are creating health and other safety risks. EU will put pressure on these type of platforms to upgrade the quality or seize to be facilitating dangerous Chinese knock of products to the EU citizens, jeopardizing a massive part of wish current revenue(also incited due to a protectionisme for own production and own local e-commerce’s platforms in Europe)

Looking at the uncertainty in the core market activities , scaring of professional investors , and the impatience of Reddit investors , who are looking for a quick buck on a stock to then move to the next meme stock.. 
Looking at the massive volumes of recent weeks, a substantial amount of shares got traded into Reddit & WSB hands , moment they start to sell or lose there interest , regardless of fundamentals, will create a huge sell off , as not many professional investment funds are jumping to load up on context logic , looking at the core market related concerns.

I could be wrong and wish could be the next Amazon, however i will sit on the sideline for now.

False, a lot of the local (highly popular) EU e-commerce platforms (bol.com , coolblue, Zalando,...) already have to implement the VAT rules. This was one of the biggest selling points for wish shopping , the cheap price , what comes serious under pressure now as from July 1st all products sold and shipped in EU will roughly get 1/5 more expensive and possible have to go trough extra control @ customs with potential increase in shipping fees."

There is no such thing as average VAT rate.

The products which would mostly be impacted are those below 22 EUR value as the current VAT and customs exemption would cease to apply to these products.Although there are many of Wish’s product falling under this category,but especially in this category,EU producers simply cannot compete with the prices of a Chinese producer simply because of cheap labor and even with a roughly 20-30% increase,those will come cheaper than EU products.

Finally,Wish local is already sourcing products from local suppliers,where Wish already applies the VAT of the Member State of consumption,this part of the business stays unaffected."

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"WORKHORSE FOR THE WORKFORCE: WKHS YOLO + NEWS **Our Apes, who art in rocket ships, hallowed by thy Workhorse tendies, thy moon will come; thy will be done on WKHS as it is in GME. Give us this day our daily mooning; and forgive us our short selling as we forgive those who short sell against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the hedgies. Amen.**

My dearest Apes, I speak to you again:

As you've seen from my previous posts, WKHS is legally battling with Oskosh (OSK) and the USPS over the unlawful recipient of the contract award. Well, here are some more important updates:

[https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940.28.0.pdf](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940.28.0.pdf)

**I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU THOUROUGHLY READ THE ENTIRETY OF THIS FILING\^ (IT IS LOADED WITH INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE UNLAWFUL USPS AWARDING)**

The document has been redacted (presumably due to NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) between the parties.

*""The USPS’s unreasonable actions directly harm Plaintiff... Had the USPS conducted the procurement in accordance with applicable law, the Solicitation requirements, and fundamental fairness, Workhorse would have been awarded the contract""*

*The USPS evidently decided early in the NGDV Program that Workhorse would not be the awardee, but it chose not to inform Workhorse of this fact, instead allowing and even encouraging Workhorse to continue to pursue the contract.*

*In the meantime, the USPS put its thumb on the scale against Workhorse. It falsely blamed Workhorse’s prototype vehicle for a “safety incident” that was clearly the result of the USPS driver’s error. It engaged in discussions with Workhorse that improperly failed to meaningfully notify Workhorse of perceived deficiencies in its proposal and that misled Workhorse as to the areas Workhorse needed to address in its updated proposal. And it unfairly evaluated the merits of Workhorse’s proposal, treating Workhorse far more harshly and holding it to far stricter standards, than it did the other offerors.*

*As was the USPS’s design all along, these improper actions left Workhorse with a technical score that ensured it had no fair chance of a contract award.*

***None of this was known to Workhorse.*** ""

And the coup de gras:

*""Workhorse respectfully requests this Court to enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor and to provide the following relief:*

*1. Entry of judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against the United States;*

*2. Entry of a declaratory judgment that the award to Oshkosh was unlawful and improper and an injunction directing that the award be terminated;*

*3. Entry of an injunction directing the USPS to reevaluate the offerors’ proposals in accordance with the terms of the Solicitation, applicable laws, and regulations;*

*4. Entry of an injunction directing the USPS to conduct a new best value determination; and*

*5. Such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper""*

**Now once again, I will reiterate briefly:**

* The contract was awarded to Oshkosh, who cannot confirm neither deny that the company submitted an EV model for durability testing. Nor did they say whether they have performed a powertrain transition swap, swapping out an internal combustion engine transmission for electric counterparts, as the contract stated. (See below)
* The fact that our favorite hedgies are back at it again, (See their WKHS short position below) is once again short against a company that is purposely being driven down with the help of our Post Master General for his own personal gain.

As you can tell, the horse community is growing, media mentions are brewing, the short interest is steady, oscillating between 40-60+% depending on who your source are. Currently, we will use ORTEX, although not always 100% accurate:

* Above, you can see that I coded shares outstanding as a percentage of WKHS shares tied into calls (meaning they are short). From the image above, you can see that more than 1.65% of shares outstanding sit at the 18 strike. Also, 1.47% shares outstanding are short at the 30 strike. Not to mention, Open Interest Updates the following trading day, so this means that WKHS was short to these percentages as of Friday's trading day close. So, let us take a closer look at the volume.
* At the 18 Strike there is currently over 37k volume and 20k volume at the 20 strike. This is massive, considering the open interest at the 18 strike currently resides at 22,065. And the 20 OI being 2,863.

However, we need to be smart apes. We are competing against the hedgies, let us remember that. So, let us look at the put side. Where is Citadel trying to press us down to?

From the looks of it, 15. Which Today, there was 13k volume in the 15 strike with only 4k OI. Presumably, a lot more puts were written today implying downward pressure.

**HERE'S THE KICKER:**

The float is roughly 135,000,000. Half is short sold (\~67 Million shares) Todays volume is 44 million+ and climbing while I write this. LOL!!!!! Do the math people. **(44/67, that is nearly 2/3's.)** We are pretty much nearing the point where if majority of the float is swallowed up and everyone sits on their hands and HODLs, you know the outcome **(GME, AMC)**. The pressure is on the hedgies my dearest Apes, we just simply buy and HODL and let those greedy bastards overleveraged themselves into bankruptcy.

OH AND LASTLY, DID I MENTION SHITADEL HOLDS A SHORT POSITION TOO? ;)

2021-06-28 22:10:19,wallstreetbets,"I blame most of this on Congress. The P.O. submitted a budget to Congress to purchase vehicles. The P.O. only submits what it's projected revenues can afford to spend. At no time during the selection process did Congress say they would provide any extra funding to purchase an all electric fleet. I am not saying OSHKOSH can provide what they said they could. They do have a company in there umbrella of businesses that builds electric firetrucks, though. It was only after the awarding of the contract that Congress offered up the money. The P.O. has only commissioned 2 different vehicles in the past 65 yrs., both times they ordered 1 vehicle to accomplish this. First it was the JEEP DJ in the mid 50's and 2nd. was the LLV starting in 1987 I think. The last LLV was made in 1994, that is why you see so many different types of vehicles being used today. They intend on choosing 1 vehicle type for the 3rd. time they replace the fleet. I am not saying OSHKOSH can do what they say. They choose 1 vehicle type for numerous reasons, parts, driver training, vehicle repairs and more. They are not going 100% electric. Once again I'm not saying OSHKOSH can make the vehicle, but I will say at the present time WKHS can not provide a gasoline vehicle which the P.O. plans on ordering roughly 40000 of. Based on the P.O.'s past preference of ordering 1 vehicle type, WKHS was not given the award. Retired letter carrier (1988-2019), own almost 400 shares of WKHS. I will wait to hear the P.O.'s response before I pass judgement on the contract awarding. #WKHS"

2021-06-29 11:23:51,wallstreetbets,"WOW, Thanks for all the time and effort you put into your D&D.  The lawsuit complaint (although one sided as attorneys always do)  Looks like a no brainer.  The Killer (on our side) is that at least 50 Congress persons are also pushing to get it overturned.   The corruption in our Gov't is surreal today, however knowing that they are not all ganging up together to protect the USPS contract is very encouraging.  I also like the fact that WKHS is only seeking the contract and not some Huge Cash award.  It makes WKHS look much more honorable.  I am holding and still buying dips as long as I can afford to.  Up to 223,000 shares now bought 1k today at $16.75 with another order in @ $16.35 If they want to keep pushing it down.

It is a commercial vehicle manufacturer... that can't profitably manufacture vehicles.  Hell, do they even have ANY contracts to sell commercial vehicles?

The fact that these are **commercial** vehicles matters.  Marketing hype and public awareness for **consumer goods** will drive investor interest, for obvious reasons.  But now that Workhorse has shot themselves in the foot, earning themselves an untrustworthy reputation... they're going to be hard pressed to win contracts with large companies.  No one wants the legal headache of trying to sue their way out of a contract with a company of hucksters.

A large part of your post is mere complaining that the UPS and USPS decided (**WISELY**) to go with a vendor with a more proven track record.

**This manufacturing company hasn't proven they can deliver.**  Can anyone show me video of one of these trucks in motion?  (I'm not counting the one where it rolls down a hill, due to gravity.)

The fact that they're misleading investors with spectral pre-orders is just the icing on the cake."

2021-06-29 00:05:22,wallstreetbets,"Well less than 1% of government procurements end with a lawsuit being filed. It is incredibly rare.

Most procurements are around 10% GM during the development phase and maybe 25% GM during production, and that is for a lucrative production phase. The programs can often end up negative operating margins for years, sometimes well over a decade for large defense procurements. It isn't until the spares and services kick in until they have a cash cow to milk.  It isn't worth the lawsuit unless you have a great chance of winning because it takes your R&D money and ties it up in millions in legal fees. in an industry where first movers has a huge advantage, this is putting all your eggs in one basket."

As long as people DO NOT SELL and buy dips as they can afford a squeeze is looking inevitable the time frame is pretty open."

2021-06-28 20:22:43,wallstreetbets,"I mean from a statistical standpoint the US government is likely going with the contractor that builds the MRAP and other vehicles for them, with a vehicle powered by batteries that they invested millions of tax payer money into and allegedly have never caught fire. Along with OEM parts from a UAW manufacturer.

So let's be really honest here. Workhorse has already been exposed

https://fuzzypandaresearch.com/workhorse-group-critical-failures-revealed/

If you don't believe the reports, you can believe Workhorses own fillings. They only made $500k in revenue the last quarter selling less vehicles than a hood car dealership. Net profit is -20,000%. They will need to dilute eventually as they have a $200 million debt due soon. They traded at 50 cents pre EV bubble as they were soon to be delisted. 

This isn't a deep value play or binary catalyst play. It's a let's sort by high to low on this short interest chart play and hope to manipulate the stock through crowd funded short squeezes. Except the hedge funds are gambling other people's money and people here are gambling their own. Anyone trying to say otherwise is lying for their own financial gain. 

Currently insiders are jumping ship having sold $100 million of their own stake in less than a year, holding on the the USPS talk to get effective ownership to ZERO at a higher stock price, and then they will start the dilution process. I can't speak for short term but long term it doesn't look good for them like it did GME."
2021-06-28 20:30:08,wallstreetbets,How retarded are you?
2021-06-28 20:31:59,wallstreetbets,"It's over bruh. Admit that y'all just want to manipulate a short squeeze. Why would the US government go with workhorse over the people who builds them the MRAP and other vehicles some of which DO have HEV drivetrains, and will be using Ford which is a UAW manufacturer. Making an ICE heavy vehicle that lasts 30 years is SIGNIFICANTLY harder than making an EV. Every engineering college in America will have 18 year olds that can put an electric vehicle together.

One of the biggest concerns about workhorse isn't even their vehicles it's their financial standing which is likely why they were never taken seriously. It's highly unlikely they will even last the 30 years needed to service the vehicles. This is something that is looked at during these bid applications.

Just for entertainment, let's say it was 100% corruption. Why does that automatically mean workhorse gets the deal? Why not go with Ford, GM, etc all of whom have EV vans? Why workhorse?"

They have been convinced that Socialism is a good thing and keep giving the Gov't more and more power over us.  It is amazing the things they get away with so easily and unquestioned.  ""the rich need to pay their fair share""  The 1% at the top pay over 40% of our annual income tax while the bottom 48% pay nothing.  The combined wealth of all the Billionaires in America is $3.5 Trillion   Yet they expect them to pay down the $30+ trillion in debt our Politicians created.  It is all smoke and mirrors, and the average voter does not take the time to add up the numbers.

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"WHY IM SO BULLISH ON $VUZI$ 
Alright ladies and retards, listen up. Some of you have already seen u/Velociraptorsss DD on VUZI a few days ago and I have to say I completely agree with him. After doing my own research, I am extremely bullish on this company. Not just because Aunt Cathie bought a bunch but for the reasons listed below:

FINANCIALS-

The smart eyeglass industry is at it's beginning stages and VUZI is considered to be the front runner already. Other competitors are virtually not even close and we have seen VUZI's YOY growth grow from 2Q FY 2020 of 2.92% to 1Q FY 2021 of 104.5%. Any company growing this fast deserves to be looked at. Although the Gross Profit YOY is still sitting at (167%) in Q1 of 2021 it is trending in the right direction up from (337%) in Q1 of 2020. Operating income has stayed relatively sideways at (20.3)m which is to be expected from any future tech company trying to expand. In 2020 VUZI's sales grew 177% YOY and in 2021 Q1 should be around 49% YOY.

SHARE PRICE AND OFFERING-

They're sitting on approximately 150 million in cash which I suspect will be used for strategic acquisitions in the AI space. Not to mention they have next to no debt, and the CEO said in a recent interview that they will not be completing any more offerings as they don't need any more cash as of right now. This is always a good thing because in a small growth company their prices are often volatile. To know management won't complete any offerings is a good sign as momentum will be killed in any large price fluctuations. It is also important to note that the offering was done at $20.50 which usually acts as a price floor and VUZI is currently trading at $18.25 at the time of this post. Cathie Wood has been buying the ""dip"" so to speak as the share price this year went from $2 - $30 and now back to $15-18 ish. VUZI currently sits in a few different ARK funds as we all know because Cathie is bullish on AI. There are currently 63.07m shares outstanding of which 7% are held by insiders and 35% are held by large institutions. These are both solid numbers and both insiders/institutions have not been selling their stakes recently.

SHORT INTEREST/RATIO

Currently the short interest is sitting at 19.42% and the short ratio is at about 2.75. This represents approximately 10.07 million shares short as of May 14th or 18.07% on short shares outstanding as of June 15th. I believe this is important because as we have seen with MULTIPLE other ""MEME"" stocks with the same or close to the same SI a squeeze is inevitable at some point. 20% isn't absurdly high but definitely enough to get some solid momentum forward and see an upside of at least 70-100%. This being combined with the fact that VUZI is a legitimate company with some solid tech and some solid backing should make for some advantageous returns. My personal PT is $70 before I'd consider taking some profit but I am a longterm holder.

MISCELLANEOUS AND INVESTMENT THESIS-

I look at VUZI as a great growth story who is early to the party. If you look at Apple, in the beginning stages of the smart phone it was tough to forecast just how big Apple would become and here we are. Just last year there were 1.8 BILLION smart phones sold and whose to say smart glasses won't rival this? I am confident in the products VUZI produces such as the M4000, M400 and BLADE glasses. They are all already used and rapidly expanding. Some of these workplaces include, Manufacturing plants, warehouse solutions for amazon esque companies, Tele Medicine ie. surgical procedures and student learning centres, not to mention field services. These products are all utilized in many different countries such as US, Japan, Germany, Sweden, Denmark etc. and are available pretty much everywhere if necessary.
Also, if you look at the evolution of the cell phone or computer being morphed into one there has been one obvious transformation. That is they are both becoming smaller and smaller and require less touch and maintenance. The transition to touch-less or touch-free products is now and I believe VUZI's products can make this transition seamlessly. For these reasons I am extremely bullish on Vuzix Corp. and my current position is.

2021-06-29 11:32:00,wallstreetbets,Too an extent I think it’s good to have some competition as it drives the company to constantly innovate but I believe VUZI is just too far ahead so at the present moment I’m not too worried no.

Great company. Undervalued stock. Hope you do well man! All the best!!"
2021-06-28 20:43:24,wallstreetbets,But $240 is a breakeven price. Is it not true that he will only make profit if price moves up beyond $240? I didn't look at his expiry date - this is going to expire in couple of days. Can he roll over his call option to a later date for the same price?
2021-06-28 22:47:43,wallstreetbets,"Yes on the date of expiry it needs to quite a bit higher than his $240 strike to be profitable, if the stock is at $240 why would anyone want his contract to buy at $240, right? So he’s either bullish it’ll break $240 and then some by 7/2 or at least moves upwards aggressively enough for the contracts to be worth more than it is currently before then. 

Rolling I’m not well versed at I usually gamble and go down with my calls. He can roll it as long as it has value, though I believe most people roll when they are not looking great for the current expiry. He can roll to an equal value future call or add money on top."

My first DD post on WSB!

Let's make some tendies on Ebay. 

\*There are over 187M active users world wide. 

\*Their gross Gross Merchandise Volume in Q1 2021 was $27.5B.

\*Their Q1 Revenue was $3.0B which beat the estimated EPS by $0.01.

\*They have 57% revenue from international operations.

\*Their expected next earnings is on 7/27 afterhours and I believe they will continue to go up. People always ride the wave before the earnings so we have a window before that happens. 

\*There is good reason to believe it would still continue pushing the all the time high to the MOON.

\*The charts have been looking GREAT and its been pushing the all time high the past week and TODAY.

\* eCommerce has been booming and Alibaba just went up 5% last week and eBay is next. 

\*This is not financial advice I just believe in the stonk."

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$LZB DD: Recline Into Tendie Town Whats up fellow degens. I’ll keep this DD short and sweet to hit all the points on why $LZB will continue its trend upwards as home sales continue to grow. As you may know, **La-Z-Boy** Residential is the “world's leading manufacturer of reclining chairs and one of the nation's largest producers of upholstered sofas, loveseats, chairs and ottomans, marketed both through a large, proprietary distribution network and through independent retail stores.”

Using high quality materials and top of the line design, their furniture and recliners are known to be a lifetime purchase meant to satisfy all your comfort needs.

**Why LZB?**

[ The massive nut you’ll get just from sitting in a LaZBoy recliner. ](https://preview.redd.it/5g6h3w7qw1871.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=56c36cd6cb254216e0d460e1b9c14b38d06b09a1)

There are several reasons why LZB is a good buy right now. Similar to GME and AMC in January, LZB has a relatively smaller market cap of around $1.75B. Over this past week it was up 6% until it dropped 3% at market close to end the day about 1.25% in the red. Every time this stock has dropped a few percent this year, it rebounded between **10%-20%**.

Nasdaq has also listed it as having a fair value of $53 by Nasdaq based on the average rating by several analysts. This would be a **43% estimated increase just to reach fair value**. This past week after earnings, $LZB dropped by nearly 12% indicating that a new rebound and ATH is nearby, with some potential swings.In a Nasdank article, $LZB was rated a strong buy at $42, yet it is near $37 now and being dumped well below it’s fair value. This is near a long term 6 month support of $36 and shows how undervalued $LZB truly is.

The June 15th earnings call also showed why $LZB has potential to grow a lot. They beat the estimated earnings by 12 cents, aka 16% of what was expected. Additionally, the trailing 12 month P/E ratio is 14.31 relative to the average 17 P/E ratio for most furniture companies and competitors. In the earnings call, it was mentioned that due to extremely high material costs currently and shortages of these items, the company is not able to make as much short term profit. But, this is being offset by increasing prices of their furniture. **This means that new homeowners who need to have furniture are paying whatever price $LZB sets, ensuring high profits and clearance of backlogged orders through the year.** Also, JPOW spoke on the same day of their earnings, causing them to sell off really fast for no reason.

[ I bet this is you right now you fat fuck. Make money of your lazyness. ](https://preview.redd.it/624026ixw1871.png?width=388&format=png&auto=webp&s=01826673909ab46b464b4745c08d83d20023419a)

**Price Action:**  Like I mentioned before, $LZB has some crazy price action.

https://preview.redd.it/dfgufqm1x1871.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=eada9626f290d948842b5c0a5e1d240d9e35f0a2

As of now, despite beating earnings, providing guidance for long term profitability, and expanding on its balance sheet. As can be seen here, after each drop since early January, $LZB recovers and reaches a new ATH. Therefore, this recent drop makes no sense compare to what many articles and the CEOs guidance has stated.

**Lazy News:** So if you’re hellah lazy and don’t trust this DD, here are some quotes and references directly from the news and the Laziest CEO of all time:

The King of Lazy CEO noted the following in the earnings call:- For the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, record sales led to all-time record profits driven by increased production capacity, excellent performance by our company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores, and continued growth and profitability at Joybird. Fiscal 2022 is off to a great start with continued robust written order rates and a record backlog, setting us up well for a strong year of shipments ahead.

**Forbes also mentions the following:** If you want to know how real the boom in home furnishings sales is and how much America is spending to make their homes nicer, all you have to do is ask La-Z-Boy. By one measurement that the company uses, “written same-store sales” for the entire Galleries network doubled, increasing 100% for the quarter. For the year, those sales were up 31%.

**Other Financials:** La-Z-Boy last announced its earnings data on June 14th, 2021. The reported $0.87 EPS for the quarter, topping analysts' consensus estimates of $0.74 by $0.13 or about 16%. The firm had revenue of $519.50 million for the quarter, compared to analysts' expectations of $498.53 million. Its quarterly revenue was up 41.4% on a year-over-year basis. La-Z-Boy has generated $2.62 earnings per share over the last year and currently has a price-to-earnings ratio of 16.6.

**Conclusion (TLDR)**: $LZB is primed for a gap up after breakout earnings . It has a low P/E ratio, good estimated earnings, and a strong following given its reputation of having the comfiest furniture on the market. I will be monitoring the price closely and until then, I have listed my positions below as well. This is not financial advice.

**Positions**: 25 7/16 $40c, 15 7/16 $45c

2021-06-28 22:23:09,wallstreetbets,"I am a manager for a Southern States La Z Boy.  I've been following this ticker for a while obviously.  Keep in mind it takes 10-12 months to build a piece of furniture.  They had a factory in Newton, MS shut down in 2020.  The new factory in Dayton, TN seems to be rolling, just not fast enough.  They opened the first factory outside of the US just recently in San Pedro de las Colonias.  They are looking to train more employees on more models at the San Pedro factory. I'm guessing they will ramp the production up there over the years as the labor is definitely cheaper which goes against everything that LaZBoy was branded around..... American Made.

The brand name is everything.  Everyone comes in has heard of us or owned a LaZBoy.   They will always own the mid-range recliner / furniture market.  The only issue I see lately is the demand has been through the roof as with many industries the last 12 months.  Everyone sat at home and realized they needed new furniture.  Everyone got stimulus checks to spend on new furniture. Lots of people bought new houses with the low interest rates and got new furniture.

The demand will absolutely start to drop soon.  The holidays will carry us through, but I just don't see the sales continuing with the 2 cost increases we've had this year and the time frame it takes to make customized furniture (which is a major thing at lazboy).

I can see this jumping up through the start of next year, but I would be very careful investing in this industry long term, as the sky will eventually fall.

Its server business was under serious threat with the advent of cloud computing; its personal computing and productivity business were... stagnant, to say the least.

But with the help of its scale, MSFT reoriented its entire towards new business models like cloud and SaaS. It opened up its Azure platform like AWS, and transformed Office into a huge ARR generating machine. The result? Its share price appreciation and valuation speak for themselves.

On the other hand, IBM decided to double down on its on-prem centric business, paddling products like hybrid and private cloud. They decided to focus on their relationship with large accounts and didn't advertise their platform to the burdgeoning startup community. The result? Stagnation.

Fast forward to today, everyone thinks VIAC is dead. Its linear business is under the threat of streaming platforms like NFLX, and its ad business under structural decline thanks to programmatic advertising platforms like GOOGL's Adwords, which are miles better in terms of targetability and traceability.

The response from VIAC management has been a swift shift into streaming. They bought Pluto, which enables Adwords-like targetted advertising; consolidated their vast media assets into P+; and reconstituted the entire company's leadership to focus more on streaming.

Will VIAC become more of a MSFT or an IBM in the age streaming? I think chances are good for the former."
2021-06-28 20:00:42,wallstreetbets,"Well, VIAC is my largest stock position by equity, so my thoughts won’t come as a surprise:

I think the negativity is overblown. They do own some pretty good content. At the end of the day that’s what matters most. Anyone can get a streaming platform. (With enough money and work, naturally.) 

I originally bought into them right after Viacom and CBS remerged. Though, I had temptations in both singular companies at first. Just didn’t have enough ‘uhmf.’ 

The fact they are together again peaked my interest the most. I think people underestimate them too much, mainly because you’re high off Disney and Netflix’s fumes. I think they’re a solid company that’s doubted too much. 

I held through the onslaught it had in 2020. Bought more shares in the process. Sold off half my stake when the rally blasted off unexpectedly. (A bit early but hey, $80-$95 was damn good tendies.) 

After the implosion, bought back my half back, plus some. I intend to hang on to them for quite a while. Definitely very bullish. 

I like IBM quite a bit too. Own them too. A larger position of mine. Similar to VIAC, not loved much and overlooked. I think with the increasing technology advancements they’ll get their fair share of the pie."
2021-06-29 03:08:47,wallstreetbets,Bought into Viacom after that whole Archegos scandal. The stock price had dropped quite a bit when I bought but that falling knife kept going. I'm almost even now and I think it's still significantly undervalued when you look at where it was before that scandal.

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,$PSFE yolo on shares and 7/16 calls. Were going to 20$ by August boys 
2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PSFE, Wyckoff Schematic, and the Great Tendie Heist Howdy Apes,

Longtime PSFE (bag) holder here with a bit of TA I think you might be interested in. For one, I know you all like rockets and tendies, and I also know how much you dislike ‘tutes hoarding those things to themselves. This will be discussed at length—all thanks to a little schematic posited by one of the OG apes, Richard Wyckoff.

Further, anyone else sort of think that Paysafe pump on Friday out of nowhere was a little odd? Yea, me too, and I’m a big PSFE bull (I sincerely really like the stonk and have for months). That will be discussed too.

My position: 2007 shares @$15.21. (Yep, lol). This is not intended as a pump or rescue mission. I’m content on my asteroid for the longterm. Still, I think you might be interested in this.

**A Little Background:** I, like every OG PSFE holder, had been pretty confused by the price action on this stock. Sure, the idea that a stock that you believe in and which seems like an obvious buy can be pummeled and overlooked by the market for a long time isn’t at all unheard of. We all know that feeling. It was entirely possible that I had just paid too much early and would be in it for the long haul—which was the plan anyway.

However, I couldn’t deny the maddening nature of some of the price action on this stock over the past few months, especially post-earnings. I had never seen such a seemingly inoffensive value stock (with growth potential) so strategically targeted by shorts any time a bullish reversal signal would appear. We knew it was shorts because a) the sheer capital it would take to bid hunt, and throw up cent for cent sell walls by the thousand at any pivot point on a stock with a relatively large float disqualified retail traders; and b) we could see it in the ever increasing short interest being reported.

What made it more interesting were the signals that we had a highly professional short that knew the exact price points that would lead to a reversal confirmation and yet would always seem to go right back on the defensive as soon as the price was pinned again. They never seemed to want to all out tank us. This seemed counterintuitive and led to a whole lot of conspiratorial thinking by folks—myself included. Remember, I was the guy who posted about the buyout theory a while back based on this short activity and on the (valuable) discovery of Blackstone’s securing of a controlling stake with their additional share purchase.

In any case, I kept trying to wrap my head around it while continuously hearing the word “accumulation” tossed around. I could accept that in a passive way, until last Wed. and Thu. (6/23 and 6/24). Watching our volume shoot up, inflow drastically outpace outflow, and yet trading within a few cent range—textbook signs of accumulation. That’s when I knew I needed to dig deeper, and it also when I stumbled upon the Wyckoff schematic. This changed everything about the way I look at this chart.

**Wyckoff, a brief history:** I will stick to what I consider the pertinent points of this method in relation to PSFE, but I would highly encourage you to do your own DD on the various facets of this method (the three laws, P&F charting, the composite man, etc) and its history. It’s fascinating.

Suffice it to say though, this method was created by Richard Wyckoff in the 1930’s as a way of conceptualizing market trends in terms of periods of accumulation followed by a mark up, and distribution followed by markdown. Accumulation occurs when a price is consolidating (typically following a downtrend) and big fish are gradually purchasing shares within the channel in a way that is inconspicuous and allows for some level of cost control. If they were to just buy it all outright, the stock price would go up, likely attracting attention and forcing them to load at higher prices. Distribution is the same in reverse. Simple enough? Again, most of this is built on the basic laws of supply and demand, cause and effect, and effort vs result. It’s worth digging deeper on you’re own

**The Point:** What makes it far more amazing though is that Wyckoff actually developed a specific schematic that these periods follow. This is where my mind got blown and Paysafe’s chart suddenly lit up for me (imagine Russell Crow in A Beautiful Mind, but much stupider)

https://preview.redd.it/9h5b5qioq1871.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=33d833db9a54db5646da949ad0c84220f1bd6c60

Notice anything specific about this schematic in relation to Paysafe’s chart? Here, I’ll help:

https://preview.redd.it/h4on23apq1871.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca1f81b60f6eab0d91592818cb5026e52f147b65

**Phase A:** The (accumulation) schematic always begins with what’s called a selling climax—the full court press that drives the price down at a rapid rate, clenching bull asses everywhere. Once that selling pressure dissipates, in comes the Automatic Rally (AR)—which is bulls taking full control and giving us a V shaped recovery back up. The bottom has now been established by sellers and the churning begins. Now look again at PSFE’s chart on Earning’s Day.

**Phase B:** Following the AR, we’ve now established the rough channel within which whales intend to load up and hope all the while that all those clenched retail bulls will bail and sell their shares for cheap. This is the game. Hallmarks of the Wyckoff schematic include: notoriously untrustworthy bullish patterns, false breakouts, and FUD. Sound familiar? They want you to sell your shares and think your stock is dead money. That way they can load up in peace without a bunch of pesky bulls (or dare I say, apes) getting all FOMO/YOLO happy and disrupting their feeding frenzy. Phase B typically includes a wave or two of sheer psychological torture, which may or may not include false breakouts above or below the bounds of that accumulation channel. Remember, they’re loading up at the bottom of those waves with all the tear soaked shares of broken retail holders. Look again at Paysafe’s charts on 6/23 and 6/24—huge volume on the buy side, no price movement. If you had watched level 2 data you would have seen how coincidentally the bid blocks mirrored the ask blocks with the buy side just being slightly larger each time. Phase B has the potential to be the longest phase and is mostly dependent on how long institutions need to load up, but then comes phase C.

**Phase C:** Okay, the institutions have now loaded up their lion’s share of the rocket so what do they do? Well, Phase C tends to be the least consistent as far the schematic goes. In Wyckoff’s model, the institutions are especially sadistic and decide to go for one last bid raid, driving the price way down once again, shredding every last paper hand and setting up the real launchpad (“The spring”). This is the real reversal, and the truest test of diamond hands. That being said, the spring doesn’t always happen. Sometimes C can look a bit more like a small subset of D, maybe with a test somewhere in the middle of the channel. Sometimes not. The point is, things are turning around and ‘tutes are ready for their tendies—or should I say, YOUR tendies if you sold.

**Phase D:** And herein lies the final test. Phase D carries us out of the accumulation channel and leaves bulls with one final test—the Sign of Strength. Here we begin to see bullish signals like flags, pennants, etc. and basically what’s happening is the top of the channel begins to be tested for support. If bulls succeed and there isn’t more opportunity for whales to go down and keep right on loading, so begins the markup phase.

**Phase E:** Now the game has changed and it’s time to ride the rocket up until whales decide they either want to take their sweet stolen profits (distribution) or we pause for another fuel up. They will do whatever they can to get every last one of us on board and touch the farthest reaches of the galaxy.

**Here’s the interesting point that inspired me to write this up today:** Take a good hard look at the timing on PSFE’s chart. Notice anything interesting about the price action on Friday into today? Coming out of the base of an accumulation channel after a B wave, we suddenly have PSFE popping up all over WSB. Look, I’ve been in this thing for months, I’m holding long because I believe in it and would love for it to get all the attention it can.

However, even the apes on WSB were commenting on how “out of nowhere” the pump came from—many of the posts from new accounts. It was bizarre. Exciting, but bizarre, and that’s coming from someone who wants for this to pump (and not dump). Now look at the price action today in regards to the Wyckoff structure. Sure looks an awful lot like a sign of strength right in the correct position and a big fat bull flag to boot. EDIT: the abbreviation on the sign is getting autobanned, so that's why I keep typing it out, lol

https://preview.redd.it/15mmq5trq1871.png?width=2376&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d1ac0c2f50fc8fb7b8907d9fd4a81e4d3861f9a

Initially, I would have said that we are premature on this sign of strength. We were most likely due for another B wave, and maybe we are. However, I can’t help but ignore that timing within the structure and the fundamental psychology behind the markup (PUMP!). Again, this is just one possible read within the schematic, and I'd be interested to hear other reads on it too. I'm no expert.

Therefore, I guess the point I’m trying to make here is, we have been operating within an age old structure for accumulation which has certainly given me some solace on this stock. We already knew whales were loading up and now we have technical evidence to prove it. However, somebody is ready for this thing to move—whether that’s apes, the ‘tutes that had been loading, or somebody who wants to spoil it for them. Hold tough, bulls. The rocket has been fueling up for awhile. They just hoped you were going to bail before take off.

**TL;DR:** Institutions were hoping you weren’t going to catch them buying up all the seats on the PSFE rocket these last few months. They’ve been buying them up dirt cheap. You want them to take her back down and buy the rest? or do you think Planet Paysafe, rich in bountiful tendies, has room for us too? According to Richard Wyckoff, the choice could be made right now."

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PLTR: FDIC Fintech conference is TOMORROW - Possible PR and awarding RPP candidates like Palantir As you read in the title, the FDIC is hosting a technology conference at almost exactly the one year anniversary of the start of the rapid phased prototyping contest.

What does it mean if Palantir is one of companies awarded a contract? Well, most importantly, **it means that every FDIC insured bank will be recommended to adopt and use their software** so they can have seamless operations with the FDIC.

Considering that we are over due for an announcement, this would be a great time to announce the award of contracts and how it will effect tech in the future. As an except from the website:

“The FDIC’s Chief Innovation Officer Sultan Meghji will also share his vision on how technology can drive economic inclusion and the role of the FDIC’s tech lab, FDITECH. The event will also feature panel discussions that will explore:

Enhancing inclusive consumer banking through fintech; Deploying technology to improve credit access to small businesses; and Exploring future opportunities for technology to drive inclusion.”

[tech conference](https://www.fdic.gov/news/events/fintech-bridge/index.html)

&#x200B;

TLDR: Palantir to the moon if contract (even small) is awarded from the Rapid Phased Prototyping contest. 

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice. Just research.

Position: 3750 shares. 160 leaps (jan 22 and jan 23) 50 weeklies at an average strike of $27

2021-06-29 01:10:19,wallstreetbets,"So your comment is exactly what needs to be called out as one of the reasons you SHOULD consider palantir as a true potential winner. Palantir doesn’t specialize in sales and marketing speak, they specialize in getting dirty and getting the job done. Let’s compare their proposal to another firm like Accenture’s, which sounds really nice:

Accenture’s proposal: 

“Accenture and Symphony AyasdiAI’s concept supports the FDIC by delivering an analytics capability to predict changes in systemic and individual bank health without adding additional burden on the banks. Their approach uses automatic pattern detection, machine learning, new sources of data, and advanced analytical methods to enrich FDIC’s current data and capabilities”

Now that sounds like some great beautiful marketing speak with really nice buzzwords that make me feel all fuzzy. Funny thing is, Accenture was already discontinued because the FDIC doesn’t care about marketing speak, they care about the demonstrated tech doing the job they want it to.

Palantir proposal:

“Palantir Technologies’ concept supports the FDIC by offering Palantir Foundry (“Foundry”)—a commercial Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that can be configured as a shared data ecosystem by means of extensible data, logic, and application capabilities housed within a single secure platform. With Foundry, the FDIC can establish a banking industry ecosystem that can accommodate the data reporting and sharing needs of the FDIC and its constituent banks while adapting to the changing realities of the organization, industry, and economy.”

This definitely sounds dry, but here’s the good news, this is exactly how the fdic speaks and what they are looking for. Something to get the job done, not to be all frills and show. I mean read their description of the contest, they even write like palantir:

“accelerate the adoption of modern technological tools to help financial institutions, particularly community banks, provide more timely and granular data to the FDIC”

This isn’t Hollywood. This is banking. My money is on the software that works the best."

2021-06-29 02:57:59,wallstreetbets,I think he may have passed out half way through then regained consciousness. His body kinda jolts then stays in the same position for some time.
2021-06-29 01:56:52,wallstreetbets,"I will try to find his username on tik tok, he posts so many amazing videos like this. He’s a ballsy mofo."

2021-06-29 09:43:18,wallstreetbets,"Eventually, it’s a sport that has a pretty high fatality rate.  Maybe that’s just with wing suits, but I saw that documentary where all his friends were dead one by one."

2021-06-28 21:28:08,wallstreetbets,I never complain about awesome growth 🍆
2021-06-29 10:55:30,wallstreetbets,"Three places.

WSB of course, but most of the stuff on here is trash. If you see a DD and the words short interest are even mentioned, dropped. I'll jump in jump out on the pump and dump garbage they handle and sometimes it works. But if you want something that is actually reliable do not touch any post that says short interest, if the stock recently dropped like 5-10% that person is probably just a bag holder trying to recoup losses, or if there are way too many people posting about it at once despite the stock not reflecting any actual movement to justify it. Like the shit going on with SOFI, I don't trust that shit. Way too much funny munny moving at it without it really changing much. So if you do find something that doesn't tick any of those boxes, dig in.

&#x200B;

Work, I find that stocks people at work recommend me they sincerely believe in. They aren't bag holders usually so if the stock is interesting enough to bring it up in conversation with co-workers its normally worth looking at.

&#x200B;

Post Covid Drops, I just look at at stocks that dropped heavily on the onset of covid and have yet to recover. Normally in the hospitality, travel, and other luxury nonsense. Its fairly reliable in my experience.

&#x200B;

As always not advice, but this info is just how I find the stocks. As far as my criteria to actually buy, I normally start with a small amount of money because I'm a FOMO bitch while I evaluate the case for why its going to take off and then double or quadruple as needed."

2021-06-29 07:23:22,wallstreetbets,"Also, this won't be a popular opinion on this sub but... Honestly, open a paper trade account with TOS and practice buying calls. Watch the relationship between delta, theta, and Vega with the value of the option movement.

It's also great to practice legging into risk free trades. One of my favorite things to do is leg into risk free spreads.

For example, if XYZ stock is at $20 and I buy the $17 call 90 days out thinking XYZ might hit $28 dollars as my PT. Let's say the $17 strike costs me $3.50 and I buy it. I'll go ahead and put in a sell order GTC to sell the $25 call for maybe $4. As the price moves up, I might get that $4 to sell the $25 call. Now my cost of $3.50 turned into a $0.50 credit (I'm now risk free), plus if the price stays above $25 I'll make $8 a share on the spread. If I do that with 10 contacts, I originally paid $3,500, sold calls for $4,000 making it risk free and making a min $500, and if the price stays above $25 I'd make $8,000 on the spread ($8,500 total)."

I should have been more clear on my question. I've had some SoFi stock for a bit and want to buy calls after open today. And I've really been trying to learn options lately. YT *In the money* is an awesome recommendation!!! That's actually where I did learn a ton of stuff over the past week! They are longgg but worth it (Watched like all 6 hrs of beginner options videos in one day 😫) 

So I guess the part I'm still not too sure about is the dates. I was looking at SoFi's  7/2 7/9 and 7/16 calls, but aint 7/2 a bit early? I guess it's not really being confused but moreso not being confident? Idfk... Thank you for trying to help ❤"

2021-06-29 07:12:07,wallstreetbets,"Retardation aside...

You want to buy calls 60+ days out. Theta eats away at the value of your options quick at 45 days, fast at 30 days, and warp speed inside two weeks. 60+ days gives your trade more time to work and your delta to outpace your theta.

Think of it like milk. When you go to the store to *buy* milk, you reach in the back to find one with a day or two later expiration date. If you were the store owner trying to *sell* milk, you're putting the soonest to expire up front hoping someone buys it. Similar idea with options."
2021-06-29 08:31:34,wallstreetbets,"Shorter dates = higher volatility/risk/reward. It also requires you to watch prices more carefully or set sell limits. 

My portfolio is 100% options.

I never have more than 10% of my portfolio in <30 day options and no more than 30% on one company because if you trade long enough, eventually a trade won't go your way and you need to limit the damage."

The Porsche is daily therapy. I love it. I bought it new ($150k) and didn’t blink. That was nice. 

The car is great, but what I’m really looking forward to is quitting the day job. The money made in real estate and the market has enabled me to essentially retire early and exit the rat race. I’ll still trade and invest in real estate but I’ll never update my god damn resume or have to deal with corporate politics ever again. July 27th is my last day.

2021-06-29 13:21:39,wallstreetbets,"So that depends on how low you buy, and what the yield is. I don't hold anything lower than 5 percent yield. And it does fluctuate.  So if you put 3500 in a 6.39% yield you would roughly make $234.50. You take that and dump it back it or you can try to double up on a cheap stonk and maybe push passed 300. Then reinvest and wait for the next yield. Currently I'll see a 7.18% yield on my initial investment.  I dump that into CLNE because its been on a dive. If I buy in 500 dollars worth for example, and then reinvest for the next quarter, I would gain 1,200 dollars overall in a week or two from just that. Repeat and hold accordingly. Now if for some reason it moons. I'd sell that motherfucker off and retire immediately. So you don't need 500k. Or even 55k. I started out with 4 thousand dollars and just repeated my process. High yield above 5 percent,  share price 10 or less dollars. Now if you're broke, a lower yield is acceptable until you can do big dick gains."

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Annaly Capital Mgmt NYSE: $NLY TL:DR Undervalued Stock. Pay big Dividend. Under $10. Strong Buy Ratings. Recent Court Action Good.   Cheap Ass Options. Who doesn't like it Annaly once in a while?

Annaly Capital Management, Inc. is one of the largest mortgage real estate trusts. They trade on asset-backed securities in both the residential and commercial real estate arenas, which includes leverage of their portfolio to manage risk and debt.

They presently trade at $9.16, down from an early June price of $9.55. The downward pressure came, somewhat, from the uncertainty related to *Seila Law v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau*, which threatened to unwind years of Freddie and Fannie loans, upon which Annaly depends. With the SCOTUS ruling in that case keeping those transactions intact, Annalys' sentiment should benefit.

Present stock value is only 2.97x earnings, which is ridiculous for this sector.  This stock is crazy undervalued. Most analysts have this is a strong buy, which leads to why it should appeal to this sub: They have slightly OTM Jul 16 9.5C at .03.  Yes. three fucking cents.  For $30 you can grab a contract for 100 shares at $9.5. With a little attention, this stock will crush $9.50.

They recently announced a large dividend, which sits at about 9.5%. Buy and hold and you profit about 10% a year.  I know that profit is a foreign concept to a lot of you, but you can buy stocks for cheap, cover 10% and gamble on the calls, hoping it pops.

Also, I know you all like it Annaly.  This is the stock for you.

Positions: none as of the time of this writing, but looking to dump $9k in stocks and few hundred in options.

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$QDEL is undervalued First shot at DD so 🌈🐼 with me. Not a professional financial expert and this information is not intended to be taken as financial advice. Quidel is a medical diagnostics company with the aim to democratize testing. The company has been profitable for multiple years. Sales and revenue prior to the pandemic were strong and continually improving. 

The company was able to create a very good rapid Covid test utilizing its propietary and relatively affordable analyzer. This allowed them to grow exponentially in 2020 with revenue in excess of 1.6B dollars. Currently the stock is trading around 125$ but went as low as low 100s and during covid surge as high as 250$. The reason for the volatility is the relatively small float volume of 42.6 million shares and the decrease in covid cases with wide vaccination efforts. The current stock price gives the company a market cap of 5.2 billion. 

If you have followed the company you will know it most recently released an over the counter rapid covid test that they sell in retail pharmacies and online retailers such as Amazon. In addition to their professional testing segment which has huge potential for growth, the companies future growth I think lies in its  attempt to sell directly to the consumer diagnostic tests that previously needed a physician to order and a lab to process. 

This democratization of medical testing can be compared to the adoption of OTC pregnency tests. The market is huge and will be compatible with an ever increasing push for digitalized primary care medicine. Short term there is an adjustment for loss of revenue from decreased covid testing in a hospital or clinical setting. 

Long-term, the company is undervalued imo. This stems from its potential to shake up and advance medical diagnostics tests for direct consumer purchasing. We will likely see OTC flu tests and whichever other testing there is a market for. My position is long with 68 shares. Company also has short interest at 13.40% or around 5m shares as of 6/15. I say that only to reflect current investor sentiment and not to imply any cheeze potential.

Regardless, a move up is well overdue.

This is a descending channel dating back to last November. Today, it finally broke up. While we would like a weekly close for confirmation - a daily close is enough to at least scale in **1/2** \- **3/4** a position. 

Now - we should target **428.10, 453.30** resistances on the low end. Above there could even see this **502 - 507** supply zone.

**375** is key support - I'll stop out below here.

My only issue with this is the huge lack of volume - I'd like to see an uptick before the end of the week. Remember - this week is the end of the quarter - lots of funds are rebalancing and shuffling their hands for the next quarter.

2021-06-28 20:07:43,wallstreetbets,"I sold some cash secured puts on BB ($14.50p 2 Jul) a few weeks ago, with a break even price of $12. I will probably get assigned at the end of this week."
2021-06-28 20:07:45,wallstreetbets,"did anyone notice a consistent bid all day in that when the stock dropped, it was immediately bought up?"
2021-06-28 20:09:14,wallstreetbets,I'm up a total of 60%. Buy when nobody is paying attention.
2021-06-28 20:18:18,wallstreetbets,"I mean, this is how I felt about my 200 shares of AMC back in January.  And GME before that.  Fine chilling."
2021-06-28 20:31:28,wallstreetbets,Bag holder here.  This makes me cry.  Why OP wanna make me cry?
2021-06-28 20:56:13,wallstreetbets,"Damn you,, I would be in the money today if I hadn't decided to double down at $19"
2021-06-28 22:15:40,wallstreetbets,Fuck you dude if you had actually watched the episode you would know that cartman is only playing to be retarded. A retard wearing retard skin. Which cancels itself out so buy more blackberry.
2021-06-29 00:50:20,wallstreetbets,I'm not leaving.
2021-06-29 01:45:01,wallstreetbets,BB is building a cup and handle formation.... give it a couple more weeks.
2021-06-29 02:00:41,wallstreetbets,Man fuck this stock 😩
2021-06-29 10:16:37,wallstreetbets,"BB IS THE NEXT AMC

And I mean amc being the poorman’s gme from Jan. Only reason amc pumped was the metric assload of bagholders and new poormen that jumped in after gme pumped in May.
By my calculations, BB bros will not have a shot at an AMC pump until AMC pumps a bit in late fall. Then BB will overshadow AMC like AMC did gme recently, and poormen will find the next bag to hold."
2021-06-28 22:49:51,wallstreetbets,Dumped BB last week to buy stocks that will actually have a ceiling. BB might move when AMC and/or GME move but that stock is crap.
2021-06-28 20:01:08,wallstreetbets,I’m bag holding at 16.5
2021-06-28 20:19:07,wallstreetbets,"I bailed a week ago.   Lucky but the attitude around here changed drastically so I sold all my gme bb and amc...and others.

2021-06-28 22:12:30,wallstreetbets,"I hope BB becomes the next GME. BB is working on new tech while GME is retail and outdated. It would make more sense for BB to spike up  like GME instead of GME itself. But again things in life a lot of times don’t make any sense, just go with the flow. I hope my 310 shares become $100k+. Let’s go BB!"

2021-06-29 11:01:38,wallstreetbets,BB GON HIT 50 TODAY!!
2021-06-29 12:55:39,wallstreetbets,"Blackberry is an innovation icon and a pioneer in smart car ecosystem. Blackberry IVY advisory council now includes GEICO TELUS HERE AWS CERENCE and it's expected to be launched in February 22.

Just today Blackberry was awarded 4 patents and they have nearly 500 new patents pending approval.

Blackberry Patent sale is nearly complete. This is going to be in billions and it's likely Facebook is the buyer of the patents and Blackberry may be partnering with Facebook to secure WhatsApp Messenger

When asked about patent sale, CEO John Chen said stay tuned. He meant hold don't sell your shares because Good News is Coming Soon.

Blackberry recently beat revenue estimates in Q1 FY 22 and went on a hiring spree. They upped sales hiring and expected to increase foot on the street by 23% this quarter.

In the quarter Blackberry customer wins include US Canadian and European Gov. In addition to highly regulated industries such Bank of China.

Don't sell your Blackberry shares only to discover that Facebook paid Blackberry over 2 billion in royalties and Blackberry and Facebook partnered to secure WhatsApp and will split revenues 50/50

More recently Facebook announced WhatsApp stores and messenger for Enterprise with premium. Blackberry could have their finger in this new venture by Facebook and it's a win win situation both both companies.

Blackberry Facebook partnership is very likely and the news could be out very soon.

Who isn't partnering with Blackberry these days.

Blackberry is on the world's stage dancing with the giants. You must pay attention who they are hanging around with and why. From Amazon AWS to Geico to Microsoft, Telus, and Baidu, Here, Cerence, Vodafone Verizon.

Is Facebook next. I wonder.

From smart phones to smart cars. Blackberry is an innovation icon. The best is yet to come for Blackberry."
2021-06-29 13:59:51,wallstreetbets,In at $10 and change. Plan on holding for a while anyway so not too worried about Ups or Downs right now.
2021-06-29 14:39:35,wallstreetbets,Its seems to pump along with the other meme stocks during a run. I am just waiting to buy in when its cheap.
2021-06-28 20:28:40,wallstreetbets,I cashed out of BB at 15 bought in at 9 🤪
2021-06-28 20:36:51,wallstreetbets,Yeah...I pussied out and sold.

2021-06-29 01:02:10,wallstreetbets,Bought at $20 all is lost
2021-06-29 01:11:17,wallstreetbets,I actually got lucky for once you tards and bought at $12.50. Been long in the other WSB since Jan so I figured why not give BB some love
2021-06-28 20:01:20,wallstreetbets,I sold it to you
2021-06-28 20:09:01,wallstreetbets,WHO’S RETARDED NOW

2021-06-28 23:24:34,wallstreetbets,Didn’t think there was anyone else more special than me buying in at $19. I respect you
2021-06-28 23:42:56,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-06-29 00:25:08,wallstreetbets,I feel better. I bought at $19. Thanks guy!
2021-06-29 12:04:22,wallstreetbets,Are we not boosting $BB anytime soon? All I'm seeing is $SOFI
2021-06-29 00:45:43,wallstreetbets,"Basically at this point I'm just consoling myself that by the time I finally make some profit, I can probably realize them as long term capital gains."
2021-06-28 22:07:51,wallstreetbets,Same here. They’ll come for us eventually.
2021-06-28 22:46:49,wallstreetbets,"This post is about the people that are buying in and thinking it’s like the meme stocks. It’s not, it’s a legit long term stock. But there are people who bought in hoping for a quick buck"
2021-06-29 00:34:37,wallstreetbets,"Is it? BB stock has already doubled in value in the past six months. In the same time frame, TSLA lost like 15% of it's value and Amazon gained by about 5%. Even in the short term of 6 months BB has significantly outperformed the market average. I guess in the context of GME everyone expects to be a millionaire overnight now, but for most investors doubling your money in 6 months is pretty awesome.

The thing I like about BB is it is great short and long term."
2021-06-28 20:13:23,wallstreetbets,Just sell covered calls man
2021-06-28 20:00:22,wallstreetbets,We got this!

2021-06-28 20:37:34,wallstreetbets,I bought 1 13$ call right away this morning and was gonna buy more if it remained in the green for 30 minutes after open. Fell back asleep woke up phone in hand and no more calls. Still rooting for my 1 and my 100 shares though!
2021-06-28 20:15:17,wallstreetbets,"Well if you want a real answer, sub 10. If you want to be a retard like most of the holders in this sub, above 20"
2021-06-28 21:23:36,wallstreetbets,Blackberry has money in the bank. They want a partnership. WhatsApp Messenger is going to be Blackberry Secure. SecuSmart enabled. For premium. Split 50-50
2021-06-28 20:09:12,wallstreetbets,So you're going to be holding trash then
2021-06-28 20:08:23,wallstreetbets,Yup right at 12.70. Huge selling pressure and it popped right back up

2021-06-28 21:19:02,wallstreetbets,Congrats on the almost $3.5 gain today
2021-06-28 22:21:48,wallstreetbets,One had extremely high short interest tho.

2021-06-28 22:08:42,wallstreetbets,"I love those plays. Well done.

I bought BB down a couple times but then decided to wait and see where the actual bottom was going to be. And I didn’t want to tie up more money. So sometimes you just gotta chill and see what happens."
2021-06-29 11:33:55,wallstreetbets,What does buying shares long term have to do with wallstreetbets? Go to r/personalfinance for that

2021-06-28 21:09:21,wallstreetbets,The IV is too low and it keeps going down. You'd need to sell calls that are practically ITM to get premiums above $1

2021-06-28 20:29:16,wallstreetbets,It seems someone with deep pockets was picking up all the bids as soon as they were available.

2021-06-28 20:47:39,wallstreetbets,"Luckily I don't ""double down"" after a rise.  Get it where I think it's low and let it float or not.

Small money player but I'm green on every stock except SNDL (which is a $1 each fluctuating by pennies so no big loss).

Truly just learning the game.  No options.  And trying to read about all the dumb yolos and retard DDs so I know what NOT to do.

Still a retard.  Just trying to pretend not to be one."

2021-06-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SOFI Lockup Expiration Play How do you do fellow apes,

Here's my first DD on WSB. Hopefully the mods don't take it down. I will keep it as simple as I can so that you smooth brains can understand.

First we need to talk about another WSB darling: PLTR.

As you can see on Feb 18, the lockup date for PLTR expired, which meant that insiders holding on to their shares could finally sell. From the chart, you can see how the stock kept dipping as we approached the expiration date.

Now look at this graph, notice any difference? Exactly. SOFI is also dipping because today, 06/28, is the lockup expiration date for SOFI as well.

[SOFI](https://preview.redd.it/mhnvdg3f31871.png?width=930&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb450e83058b3720135ead0899ff36c849723d0f)

Now, after the lockup date expired for PLTR, it opened 10 percent higher the next day and kept climbing to 29 bucks. I expect SOFI to do the same.

The play here is to buy near dated calls with a strike price that is around 18-20 dollars. Your profit on an 25 dollars investment on an $20 strike call will be upwards of 50 dollars. That's a 200% increase.

how can u pump lock up expiration as a reason to buy now?? Ur saying pump it up so they can jump right out at sweet premiums at our expense?? fuck em they can wait. I'd give u credit for pushing options and not shares, but its the same locked up holders who are the ones selling options against their shares!

so hard pass for now.

I am on the other side of the trade. Yesterday I sold 10 covered calls with a $47 strike that expire this Friday and another 17 covered calls later into the month.

2021-06-29 00:02:35,wallstreetbets,"It was overpriced at $5, and it's obscenely ridiculously overpriced now. Just because it still hasn't returned to reality doesn't mean the current price is at all remotely reasonable. 


I mean TSLA has been stupid crazy for a long time now, but that doesn't mean that it's justified to be worth more than Toyota, Honda, GM, Ford, VW, and BMW combined. Just demonstrates the truth of that old saying: the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. 


Think about it. Attendance has been declining industry-wide for 2 decades, the studios are shifting towards their own streaming services and bypassing theaters directly, the company was already losing money pre-pandemic, they have thin margins in a good year and they now have a shitload more liabilities and debt so it's unlikely they'd turn a profit even if attendance immediately snapped back to pre-pandemic levels. Oh and on top of that, despite all the money they've raised (by diluting the absolute fuck out of their shares), they're at risk of being completely out of money in 18 months. They got through the pandemic by deferring a lot of their rent and debt payments to this year, so expect those costs to increase, making it even *more* difficult for them. And that justifies a $30B market cap? For a company that has revenue a little over $5B normally and makes like $100MM net income in a *good* year??


And yet apes are lining up to give their money to the hedge funds they think they're bankrupting by buying obscenely overpriced shares in a dying movie theater because they think there's gonna be a squeeze, even though the volume over the last month has been multiple times the float, sometimes even exceeding the float in a single day (meaning that even if you're shorting and losing money, it ain't exactly hard to cover if you need to).


Now if you've made money then congrats, but don't act like this is a smart play by any means. It's so mind-bogglingly stupid that it's hard to even put it into words. Is it possible it goes up further? Yeah, totally. I'm not exactly a TA expert but even to my eyes I think there's a chance it goes up over the next few days and I'm considering buying calls as much as I hate it, because I don't hate money. But good God is this retarded, and it won't end well. Many of y'all are gonna lose >90% of your ""investment"" when it's all said and done."

2021-06-29 05:13:16,wallstreetbets,"I saw a quiet place 2 at the theater.  I like going there but I'm not supporting bad movies being made simply so I can support a business being open.  That's absurd.  Make good movies, I'll go there.  I'm not using AMC as a portal to Marvelland."
2021-06-29 05:47:24,wallstreetbets,"I like it. But before FF was just revving, ricer cars and NOS. There’s a bit more character development after Tokyo Drift and it kinda pulls all the character together which is fun to watch. Is it realistic? No of course not, but it’s a fucking movie and not a documentary how realistic do you expect it? They even poke fun at themselves for being invincible somewhat breaking the fourth screen. Is it a cash grab at this point? Yes of course it is. Even Vin Diesel said the follow ups would ruin the original but you can’t say Fast and Furious 1 and 2 was lacklustre in terms of character. You never understand Dom or Brian or anyone in fact."

2021-06-29 05:28:37,wallstreetbets,"Lmao you’re comparing coin base to AMC now? A failing movie theatre chain (pre pandemic) that was losing profitability because of streaming.

What has AMC changed? 

There’s people piling into their stock for a squeeze and diluted the fuck out of their shares and raised capital to pay off debt.

No change in business plan. They plan on acquiring a few more theatres that went bankrupt and were in high revenue locations.

They haven’t announced any fundamental change to their business model. It’s literally the same pre covid failing company. 

Theatres, as they currently stand with no innovation, are a novelty. Sure people enjoy going to the movies every now and then. But streaming is going to continue to end the theatre business like Netflix ended blockbuster. 

The numbers might be exciting as the country opens back up and people are excited to go to theatres again, but you’ll see them quickly die back down as we return to normal and so will AMCs stock price.

Unless they keep all of you captivated and find more people that think coin base and AMC are comparable in any way, shape or form."
2021-06-29 00:27:58,wallstreetbets,"The key detail when discussing shorts and their coverings isn't whether they have covered, it's whether they CAN cover. If they can cover but choose not to, you don't get a squeeze. It only happens when there's that ""oh shit, I gotta close this out now"" that then forces others to close their shorts. And with AMC's volume, they have had many, many opportunities to cover if they needed."

2021-06-28 20:33:44,wallstreetbets,"Exactly my point.

1. I'd call it a data point, and you immediately come off as offended which is hilarious and makes me think you work for FB, or one of their PR firms, or are just a huge asshole that values being contrarian.

2. No shit, my point is the reduction in traffic means less money for them as advertisers begin to realize the decline in value when spending their ad money at FB. FB has been touting strong MAU's for years, but stalling or declining DAU's would show the true story.

3. If that's even true, aside from the fact that online advertising chases the 18-35 crowd, thinking that's something GOOD to say about a company to try and justify falling youth engagement is funny.

4. And? I'm willing to bet their DAU's have also peaked. They're more fresh than FB, for sure, but I've long since deleted my account, as have many others I know. Fewer people are looking for online validation, it's become ""not cool."" And if you are, you're on newer social networks. Twitter I'd grant an exception to. I think their formula is a bit more timeless."

2. I misread your comment before and thought you wanted the MAU, not the DAU. Anyway [here you go](https://www.statista.com/statistics/346167/facebook-global-dau/). Surely you could've googled it yourself. Besides, it wouldn't make sense for revenue to be way up if website traffic was down.

3. You're arguing this as if FB's advertising revenue isn't public knowledge, which it is. If you looked it up you would quickly find out that FB is growing faster than any other FAANG company. I guess the free market disagrees with you regarding the value of older users. And I'm assuming you haven't even considered Facebook's penetration in developing nations.

 I do have a bunch of other long positions (shares, call spreads at various expiries & strikes) though will likely unwind some of the spreads this week as I have captured most of the reward and now the risk/reward may not make a ton of sense)."

2021-06-28 21:00:48,wallstreetbets,Nah. $14-$17 rangebound for the foreseeable future.
2021-06-28 21:08:58,wallstreetbets,"2% of WISH shares are available to the retail market. About 3% of that 2% (0.0006%) is short interest on retail shares. 

So, it’s not me just saying it, but those 200 shares (or any of the rest of retail volume on WISH) doesn’t matter in the slightest. 

Just buy options and watch the momentum metrics for any sea change and otherwise just the enjoy the ride. Share purchases mean zero on this one."
2021-06-28 20:02:06,wallstreetbets,"No kidding!!! The deep ITM calls aren't traded very often. Thankfully, this specific one has a decent OI, so it's not as illiquid as others."

It’s your point. You explain it if you want to"
2021-06-28 20:12:17,wallstreetbets,"I wanted a delta over 85 that let me buy control of as much stock as possible. That way, it’s basically like buying at 2:1 leverage without the headache of interest."
2021-06-29 03:14:53,wallstreetbets,"Yes more shares would result in both more gains and losses. Very efficient thought process you have, along with a knack for distiling a 'complex' topic, and astounding accuracy when it comes to which comment you're replying."
2021-06-29 01:53:06,wallstreetbets,Better to exercise then sell.  Especially if you can exercise for free.
2021-06-28 21:31:09,wallstreetbets,Yes I like this. But you are not planing to exercise it I suppose?
2021-06-29 02:52:32,wallstreetbets,Exercise *a right to buy*. You still need to have the cash to actually buy the shares before you can sell them. That's why it's often preferable to sell instead.
2021-06-29 08:58:35,wallstreetbets,"That's not how I understand the math.  

eg. My NIO 8/20 $45c is currently worth $7 with the underlying value of the stock sitting at $50.  If I exercised the contract, I would only get $5 vs. sellling the contract for $7.

> Especially if you can exercise for free.

Fee and taxes are the last thing you should be concerned with when selling assets."
2021-06-28 22:41:56,wallstreetbets,"No. Def not planning to exercise. 

I have 4 exit criteria:

1) Drops below $12
2) Fails to break about $17 before 7/9
3) Spot hits $23.5
4) July 23 comes around, regardless of spot price."
2021-06-29 05:53:55,wallstreetbets,"could just exercise in small batches to sell, but it kinda depends on fees volatility, bid/ask spread for option vs shares, etc."
2021-06-29 13:19:05,wallstreetbets,"This is where it matters whether it's a $3,000 stock or a $7 stock"

2021-06-29 03:07:54,wallstreetbets,"I don't doubt that they've changed their short positions to be less visible, but FWIW - all the DD here and elsewhere says that short sales OTC/in dark pools still need to be reported. And there are certainly a boatload of ways that stocks can be shorted without it showing up in the publicly reported percentages.

Whether they're *actually being reported* as short sales, however, is a whole different bag of cats."

2021-06-28 20:49:45,wallstreetbets,You're probably right. I've been in since IPOE. Screwed up and averaged up the DAY before they dipped hard. I didn't think they would go lower than $20. If they go down to $15 I'll buy more🤷‍♂️
2021-06-29 15:49:41,wallstreetbets,Can you stake shares on fidelity? If the tards would like to short it I’ll gladly let them pay me to do so
2021-06-29 06:07:52,wallstreetbets,Imports and exports
2021-06-28 22:36:55,wallstreetbets,"I'm kind of conflicted to be honest. I agree with the hype that this is a long term play and has some serious potential once they complete the bank merger and add the missing pieces on their investing arm. If I take advantage of the pump, I'd probably wait till a bit later in the week or even until next week, I think it might build up for a little bit yet"
2021-06-28 22:42:53,wallstreetbets,"SPACs make life weird.

My approach has been to wait for things to get cheap during the SPAC period. You see lots of SPACs dip below $11 until the merger hits. If I really like a company, that's when I get in. Usually around or below $10.

So far, the only one that has fucked me on this strategy is TALK. Even then, I'm willing to sit on the shares and see where things go. My thesis there is that if Medicare/Medicaid approves therapy apps as a broad category, it's going to be a land rush.

SOFI is far from my favorite, I concede.

FTR, I have nothing against buying the dip, especially in the post-lockup period. I just think folks are overlooking what a flood of liquidity can do in terms of triggering a dip.

Of course, there are folks hunting for squeezes, too.

And there are people pumping the stock before they sell. It's not an accident, for example, that CLF got a pump right before MT sold their stake."
2021-06-28 22:34:08,wallstreetbets,"That's good to know. Fintechs seems like a crowded space. As much as i hate to admit it Robinhood sure did know what they were doing for new investor and with their ipo coming later this year I'm curious how bad that gme incident will impact them. I find myself second guessing a potential play when the bearish outlook is questioning their ability to make a profit... That being said I've been trying to use webull, thinkorswim, etc and just can't find a platform that i like yet. Maybe Sofi will provide that when they that options trading. Any word on a time frame for adding that ability?"
2021-06-29 07:44:15,wallstreetbets,"Sofi also doesn’t let you choose what to display for your stocks, like it’ll show day change and price, and dollar day change but it won’t show your day return or total return.

2021-06-29 16:46:17,wallstreetbets,Good to know. And is the risk of allowing them to do this just that you may not be able to sell your shares when you’d want to?
2021-06-29 16:47:48,wallstreetbets,Nah. You can sell. The paperwork lays out the risk.

I am new to investing but I happened to buy some VIAC at $40 and I don't have any plans to sell it. I like the collecting stocks aspect of investing, but I understand little about how you guys determine the stock to be undervalued. It's only in the extreme cases like with AMC where I can totally understand that it isn't a $30 billion business. Any insight is appreciated."

2021-06-28 23:37:50,wallstreetbets,I am friends with some one who was in a top level mgmt positon at dnb. In charge of corporate events which were one of their biggest money makers. Unfortunately no more companies are having partys and get togethers anymore and they have laid off that entire section of their business in this store and others.  Not sure how much of that is their percentage of revenue but it is a decent amount for sure.

2021-06-28 20:48:33,wallstreetbets,No thanks. I don't invest on a bet that your sports betting will generate more revenue to try and bring you out of the hole. And that's only at stores where it is legal. You are also expanding with new stores which is good in most cases but is this expansion too much too fast? Only time will tell.

2021-06-28 23:30:39,wallstreetbets,I think around $18. Probably $20’s next week if we can break the $15 resistance tomorrow
2021-06-28 23:50:32,wallstreetbets,"I think it’s pretty much impossible for it to fizzle out now. It’s had higher volume than GME, AMC, BB etc consistently. It’s showing up on every momentum and volume screener, day traders and swing traders all see the set ups. Just has to follow through before they can enter at correct times. I’m not a “YOLO”er typically but I’m pretty confident with WISH. May not be getting spammed in the comments of WSB but there’s tons of big time investors on social media with huge followings that are all touting much higher PTs too so I think it has nowhere to go but up. And soon"
2021-06-29 00:36:37,wallstreetbets,"You're not looking very hard. It remained in the top 5 of WSB pretty much all day, Stocktwits volume on it was significant, and multiple Youtube streamers are following it."

So here is an infinite money glitch 2021. It is the 2.5%APR on margin. I am borrowing 50K from the generic bank for 1 Year for 4%APR, not monthly, yearly. Drop it into RH for that sweet 2x power upgrade, so that 50K is now 100K at an additional 2.5%. If you can't beat 6.50%, and not even that much, I am just too lazy to do the real percentage, you have no business going this route. And you won't get to wake up every day for a week straight of 5K to 10K margin call."

How does Obama figure in?  I know my wife gets pissed about some of the insurance problems and ways doctors/patients can abuse the system due to some of his choices but does it extend to the cost of med school?"

His problem is he is spending as fast as he is making it and not paying any debt down but actually increasing his debt across the board.  This guy is simply making bad choices upon bad choices.  I should also say we are just leaving covid which drastically reduced his earnings for the last year plus and he during that time continued to spend like he was making what he expected to make.  So essentially he has compounded his issues and he will feel it for years to come."

Maybe we should just hurry up and die so you can have our home huh? Who gives a shit right? As long as you get what you fucking want, piss on everyone else? I'm getting pretty fed up with us boomers always getting spit on in this sub. No one handed us a fucking thing. We've worked our ass's off to get where we are and a lot of us are nearing retirement with not near enough money  to live a comfortable life because we've got our grown ass kids (looking at you) and grandkids living with us because whether you want to admit it or not, the government/stock market hasn't just fucked over your generation, they've been fucking over all us for years. Fuck off with your entitled millennial bullshit."
2021-06-29 03:51:43,wallstreetbets,"Federal take over of student loans was part of the ACA. The feds have control over the rates and have kept them FAR above the prime rate. They could have dropped the rate to prime or pinned it at a fixed 2% or something easy for people to pay back, but chose to keep rates high because really, they don't give a rip about the American people. Also, they give loans out to anyone and everyone, which sounds like it's a good idea until the schools realized that they could now charge whatever they wanted because people need to get degrees, and now they could get loans from the government for whatever amount the school desired.  Obama's policy put them in position to absolutely rape their students financially, saddling whole generations of students with a mortgage on their bain before they could even get a job. Student loans are also one of the most toxic forms of debt, in that you can't even bankruptcy your way out of it. 

TL:DR; When you subsidize something (student debt) you get more of it (higher tuition costs)."

2021-06-28 21:21:23,wallstreetbets,"Lol, the 🤣 emoji =/= mad.  I'm not mad. I am, however, calling out how funny it is to see people that do not realize how much the price of tuition has grown in comparison to wages since they went to school.  Acting like the only way to graduate with six figure debt is by being an idiot or by wasting money.

Also, your privilege is showing and you are making the exact same wrong assumption that I was calling out, except this time you are assuming people's parents wasted too much money as opposed to the students wasting money. 🤣  Not everyone has parents that can afford to save enough for college. Some people are born into families barely scraping by and for whom college was not even something they saw as a potential future to plan for, because none of them went.  You think families like that can afford to put aside $750/month (that's what I've calculated and am saving for my son) for a 529 plan?!"

2021-06-29 00:18:01,wallstreetbets,"If you read my post I was saying that in past generations life expectancy was lower and most people would sell their homes in move into assisted living or die (which is a fact of life). It’s in the name “baby boomer” which means there’s a significant population of older adults then in past generations. There are a variety of factors including wage stagnation and the cost of living in proportion to wages earned that contribute to unaffordable homes. That said, if you guys don’t leave/downsize it’s going to obviously create a shortage in supply. Now that I’ve covered the shortage aspect, now let’s talk about price. If the home is 20 or 30% over valued then it will take significantly longer for us to build equity which in turn means wealth bc most Americans wealth is tied mostly to their homes equity. Don’t take it personally, when I say “fucking boomers” I’m not talking about your old ass specifically rather boomers in general. My parents are boomers and I love them, they’re super smart paid off their mortgage within 13 years. They already have told me they will die in their home. Most likely other boomers will do the same and perpetuate the shortage. As medicine advances I assume this problem will get worse. I see older folks are getting butthurt but it’s just facts, I’m not making this up or saying it bc I have a grudge against the elderly lmao. In conclusion, I don’t want buy a townhome that’s 2000sq for 600k. That’s unreasonable even for metropolitan areas considering those same town homes were 450 not long ago. If I’m right and a crash occurs in the next year, my gamble paid off and at least I saved 50-100k. If housing prices somehow maintain then I’ll have bite the bullet and work till I’m 75 Ig or hopefully get lucky on GME.

Edit: I even was thinking of moving to Georgia to save on housing costs even there it’s skyrocketed. Let’s see what happens when forebearnace ends and market downturns occur which is bound to happen bc it’s cyclical."

2021-06-28 21:51:14,wallstreetbets,"LMAO. The guy whose first comment in this thread was about how everyone's parents should have saved more for their college fund is now lecturing about making sacrifices. Something tells me the people who grew up on government cheese and food stamps that go on to college and success know a hell of a lot more about sacrifice than the person saying mommy and daddy should have saved more.

Not that it should matter since I am talking about our education system as a whole, not particular people, but since you seem so keen on making this about it panning out for me financially, I'll point out that I am doing just fine thanks. I am 6 years out from graduating law school with $250k in debt, I make great money and I have paid off all of my loans, and am on my way to early retirement (I'm also saving to fully fund my kid's college tuition, because I can and because I know it will allow him to be more competitive and have more options).

This isn't about me or you. It is about a system that discourages very capable and intelligent people from pursuing an education if they want to. A system that actively makes us less competitive in the global economy. But yeah, keep crying because you think I am looking for donations to some ""useless cause."""

My point was, *assuming the market is efficient* selling covered calls (or, something like the wheel) should not do better than (say) buying and holding an index. I know I'll get downvoted for saying that because only successful day traders post here, but for the average retail investor it's pretty clear according to the literature.

But it's definitely true that it is tax disadvantaged (short term instead of long term cap gains) which does not relate to market efficiency. So, you actually have to do like 25% better than the market to break even."

>I think if Canoo can get some corporate contracts for delivery vehicles (UPS/USPS/Fedex/Amazon), that's really where the money is.

I don't get excited by any offerings from VW. They have always uninspired as a company. I can't recall any innovations they've brought to market in the last 20 years. The june buggy and vw mini van were their claim to fame, made popular by the mainstream icons of their time.

They look look conservatively luxurious but that's about it. Not hating, just have never met anyone that did not regret their purchase due to high maintenance costs and the frequent need to fix things. Canoo brings customizability, comfort, and convenience.

2021-06-28 21:55:47,wallstreetbets,"and.. took away the street view window from the base model...I mean Come on man, that wasn't cool to put cool interesting features in the prototype and then take them away after people were invested - how is that acceptable to any investor - they must not pay close attention to design as part of their investment thesis - with Canoo I think design is 99% of the investment - either it's going to fken blow up or it's going to just be ok"

2021-06-28 22:01:34,wallstreetbets,except Tesla successfully did all that around the same time? which makes Fisker suspect now just in it's whole storyline in my opinion - like..will I ever be a successful car company? certainly doesn't seem to be sure thing - companies that are a sure thing don't try to push their car on the Pope
2021-06-28 21:30:20,wallstreetbets,Valid points. I can defiantly see them in certain environments. I do like the skateboard platform though. The vans and minivan have good potential.

2021-06-29 01:13:26,wallstreetbets,"My point is that anyone that succeeds or fails during the start of an industry are flipping a coin. Tesla had tons of issues, they also rely/relied on 3rd part Battery production (panasonic, LG, and Samsung to name a few). By all accounts, they should have failed. Why didn't they? Legacy automotive just didn't fucking move. I really thought after I saw the Chevy Bolt that was the start of a wave. This is the real story imo. How ineffectual ICE has been.

Conspiracy autismo brain: it would be in the Legacy industry best interest to bag on as many of the new start ups as possible. Maybe the bears are just GM? joke. GM has been involved in a few start up failures. Nikola and now seemingly lordstown...

Considering that...Fisker looks competent.

Then you have faraday future who should be looked at worse than Fisker as their issues were more recent...

Lucid isn't really much better.

With that in picture it explains why Fisker looks more safe. They had financial issues but things are different. Designer is known and has worked in the industry. Already 2 contracts that show a road map(future). I do think they are a risk. All investments are. Its just there is no way im getting in Tesla with 2020 prices and the majority of investors who missed out are looking for the next Tesla/NIO.

so you see Fisker...

I dont like the reasoning but I'm not going to deny investors more money than sense approach. 

2022 will be wild though.

The pope PR thing is actually hilarious. Consider what Elon has done in the past, this is fairly child's play. Who actually is going to buy a car because of its affiliation with the pope? It was purely for the headline and the stupid look of the pope mobile.

Some side info/insider shit: I know someone in GM, they told me that GM is positive that Tesla wont break 7% of the market and they do not see them as a threat. (market? domestic? international? no idea). lets see if legacy doesn't shit the bed again this decade..."

2021-06-29 07:45:13,wallstreetbets,"Yeah theta was my bad. I'll make the adjustment. As for collars and straddles, they are less popular here because they're more risk averse than your typical bull/bear spread but they are used for particular market conditions. 

Straddle is when you want to bet on the volatility of the stock without knowing where its gonna go. 

Collar is betting stock trades within a certain range. You think upper limit is strike price of the call you sold and down limit is the strike of the put you bought. Because you sold a call and bought a put, you can trade within a range without having a cash outflow because premiums of the call will offset premiums of the put"

There were several posts on wsb over the last few weeks discussing it. There's literally like 5-10 posts a day on wsb, so the fact you haven't seen any means you don't frequent at all.

That's not my fucking fault.

It was basically an analysis of different meme stock DDs and demonstrated that **as a ratio** no more GME posts were removed than any other. Also, the whole argument was ALWAYS moot because **anyone** can see why their post was removed.

Go frequent /new of wsb and tell me how many gme posts you see being made. It's not rocket science dumbass. People migrated elsewhere because they're literally the DUMBEST fucks around.

""Don't let them divide and conquer us apes!!""

• buys AMC as well  
• moves to a different subreddit that's an echo chamber  
• tell everyone in the echo chamber that wsb is compromised so the echo chamber gets fucked by the reddit admins  

Let me fucking tell you, so far... apes are being herded like fucking sheep.

Say 50% profit margin to be conservative, so if they can get 5 spaceports running that’s 5 billion in revenue or 2.5 billion in earnings.  On a 20 PE that’s a $50 billion market cap or $225 a share."

2021-06-28 21:09:42,wallstreetbets,"Today was 10k and 3300 volume respectively on those calls. 

Volume of the stock was below average… 3m-ish. 

The float is so low on UWMC though…"
2021-06-28 21:52:41,wallstreetbets,"Forgive me, I'm still learning and don't think I'm understanding correctly.

1) You said there was 60k and 40k calls (10m shares combined) between $10 and $11 calls. What were the DTEs for these 100k calls? Is that a combined count for *all* purchased calls at those strikes regardless of expiration? And where did you get those numbers anyways?

2) by volume lf stock, you mean remaining/unpurchased stock? If that's the case, doesn't it mean the stock pretty much must go up from there?"
2021-06-28 23:24:19,wallstreetbets,"I’m not really sure what DTE is.
That is the open interest on the next expiration date (16 July), you can look at open interest on $10 and $11 calls. I’m not sure about the future dates.

The volume of the stock, just the daily buys/or sales. UWMC has a float of about 90m. So if the owners of those 90m didn’t really want to sale, the price would go up to meet those sale prices"

On the 13th, just to make an example of idiot FUD retards like you, I made a point to call every major trade I was going to make before I made them, just so people could see the candles happen (or, in the case of the movie theatre you're probably also into in your quest to invest in the shittiest theses in the world, called that I was not going to let the price exceed 59.98 and then threw up a 35,000 share sell wall 3 minutes later to ensure it).  It's documented.  Hell, it's STILL documented, because my intern has been slacking on keeping my comment feed cleaned up. You can timestamp literally every trade from that day and then see a corresponding unusual level of volume and price movement that happened a minute later.  I've literally made millionaires here.  I don't have to prove anything.

You, on the other hand, might need some of that Lawnmower Man treatment"

After the split, I bought 10 $61.50C for 7/16. Calls exploded after Google announced the pushback date of 3rd party cookies removal from chrome."
2021-06-28 22:15:20,wallstreetbets,But that IS how you play earnings.

2021-06-29 12:51:29,wallstreetbets,I have a wireless keyboard. When it's charging it often stops working in wired mode. Like if I reboot the computer

2021-06-28 20:00:44,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-06-29 13:14:13,wallstreetbets,Check out the massive insider buying. Seems like a strong indicator of good things to come.
2021-06-29 11:42:40,wallstreetbets,"Man at 4.84 in Feb?  You must have caught the absolute peak hour, peak day as I dont see the price hitting that high looking back 6 months.  Its coming though.  Look at the 10% gains this morning, out of nowhere.   Insiders have bought MILLIONS of shares in the past 3 weeks.  

Pipelines are not killing offshore drilling, land fracking is.  Thing is, land fracking is frowned upon more than offshore drilling because its in your back yard.  The Biden admin is deadset against fracking and pipelines in the US.  Offshore drilling is invisible to 98% of the earths population, Biden has little control over it overall, and unless there is a catastrophe its happening.  This stock is coming back, Im confident of that.  Where it will end up?  Cant say that, but if we hit hit $100 oil theres no reason it wont be over $10-$15 at bare minimum."
2021-06-29 11:49:31,wallstreetbets,"It has several things going for it.

1.)OPEC+ wants high oil prices, but they also want to keep wildcat frackers in the US from going apeshit, so they will carefully control output to prevent sudden spikes that would encourage frackers.

2.)Keeping frackers constantly on their toes with the threat of plunging prices from OPEC is good for deep water drillers, as these projects take a lot of time and investment.

3.) The Biden admin is extremely anti-fracking, anti-pipeline for the contentinal US.  This is great for offshore drillers like Transocean.

Its not going to be a $GME, but then again, its a real stock with real potential.  Real stocks often take time to build momentum, especially boogeyman oil stocks.  This stocks valuation is reflecting that right now.  When overall sentiment changes to positive, RIG can definitely become a rocket."
2021-06-29 18:33:18,wallstreetbets,"Let me get this straight. You think Biden will kill pipelines, but somehow has no say in offshore approval?  You also believe that the entire East Coast/Gulf of Mexico,, who recently dealt with oil spills. Is somehow less vocal than people who don't want new pipelines?  You also seem to miss that RIG is a service provider. Not an oil company. The price of oil, means nothing. Unless there is a large increase in demand that OPEC cant keep up with.  And at the current pace of increase. We won't even see 2019 levels of oil usage till 2022. Outside of 1 insider buying alot of shares. Every other point you make is based on nothing.  https://www.nrdc.org/experts/valerie-cleland/biden-pauses-offshore-drilling"

2021-06-29 15:31:45,wallstreetbets,They dipped huge back in may. Then the stock split. Then Google announced they were waiting until mid-2023 to phase out 3rd-party cookies from Chrome. I’m not expecting much of a dip soon.
