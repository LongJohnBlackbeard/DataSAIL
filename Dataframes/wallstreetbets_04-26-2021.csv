2021-04-26 19:48:40,wallstreetbets,"I bought at the top, been averaging down as grab more shares in both Tilray and Aphria. I am long on this also."
2021-04-26 19:58:04,wallstreetbets,"Balls deep in tilray, saving up some more to average down."
2021-04-26 19:49:11,wallstreetbets,Uh bagholding at $30... Reporting for duty... uh reluctantly
2021-04-26 19:52:09,wallstreetbets,"Holy fuck. Your retarded high buy price resulted in a big gain. 

Permaban if you sell for anything less than this."

2021-04-26 19:34:37,wallstreetbets,Since I'm 💎🤲 handing my GME and AMC i have some on RH but they will be first to go when time to exit... not sure when that will be??? 🚀🚀🚀🌕
2021-04-26 19:47:44,wallstreetbets,Never apologize for what brokerage you use. It's your fucking money.
2021-04-26 19:29:47,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
2021-04-26 19:50:01,wallstreetbets,I am grateful for you apes for showing me the WAY!
2021-04-26 19:29:22,wallstreetbets,Looks right to me!
2021-04-26 19:47:37,wallstreetbets,Congrats!  Nice chart
2021-04-26 19:29:25,wallstreetbets,Teach me!
2021-04-26 19:53:09,wallstreetbets,I certainly feel foolish for not buying a call when I saw it at $12 last week. Now my funds are all tied up in other plays. I'm not too upset. This week looks like it's going to be good for me. But this would have sent it over the moon. :)
2021-04-26 19:50:53,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-26 19:34:40,wallstreetbets,Congratulations and go fuck yourself.

2021-04-26 19:23:53,wallstreetbets,You son of a bitch!!!! Well done.

2021-04-26 19:43:49,wallstreetbets,I would post mines but Got damn. Well done 👍🏼
2021-04-26 19:24:24,wallstreetbets,Is it too late to buy?

2021-04-26 19:22:59,wallstreetbets,Please xplain. I want to buy options. May 21. 35$. Don't understand. If I do and the price is 35 on may 21. How much do I make? Do I need to sell the option to make the $.?
2021-04-26 19:25:39,wallstreetbets,Sndl to the moon 🌙 🌙
2021-04-26 19:33:31,wallstreetbets,Edit: did not mean to reply to comment 😬
2021-04-26 19:58:56,wallstreetbets,Not selling till buyout.
2021-04-26 19:51:44,wallstreetbets,My limit sell is set at $150 I'll move it to $200 when we hit $100 pps.
2021-04-26 19:50:45,wallstreetbets,Shorts will buy back* sending MVIS to Saturn
2021-04-26 19:51:53,wallstreetbets,"Just bought 2 shares $28 per share, people are saying that I'll go 100-700 per share by the end of the week or upcoming weeks...Thoughts on this?"
2021-04-26 19:33:07,wallstreetbets,"Ah this question again. What answer are you expecting? Everyone here is going to say something along the lines of “the best time to buy MVIS is now 🚀.” In my opinion, we have another day of this, so my answer is no it’s not too late to take some tendies home"
2021-04-26 19:56:34,wallstreetbets,Holding 50 shares of that one. 😉
2021-04-26 19:24:15,wallstreetbets,I don't recommend buying options until you've learned the answer to this question on your own
2021-04-26 19:27:39,wallstreetbets,Just buy shares and study on options before entering that game
2021-04-26 19:25:48,wallstreetbets,"Based on this question, I’d give it a few years before you buy a single option"
2021-04-26 19:47:58,wallstreetbets,"What others said, don't touch it til you actually know whats going on. But maybe find a random one at like 5c and buy a contract for $5 to play around and see what happens to its value over time. But for some more info:

I bought 3 contracts of May 21 @ $35 for $1.70 each. That gives me the right (or the option) to buy 100 shares * 3 contracts so 300 shares at the $35 price no matter what its actual current price is. As of now those contracts are valued at $4.20. Instead of buying 300 shares at $35 each, I can also sell my contracts back at the $4.20 value and turn my original investment of $510 into $1260. The value of the contracts does not correlate specifically with the price of the stock, but the likelihood that the price of the stock will be at or above the strike price ($35) before expiration, and thats based on a couple factors like price and rate of change and stuff (Implied volatility).

Way way more info to figure out before you really touch it but its not thatttt confusing once you look into it a little."
2021-04-26 19:54:51,wallstreetbets,"Some very good answers already given. Understanding options is difficult at first but you'll want to make sure you understand how the basic things like stock price and time affect options before you invest too heavily into them. 

I learned the old fashioned way... by losing money with my first options."

2021-04-26 19:48:15,wallstreetbets,Learn the Call option first. Know it well. Then learn the Put and know it well. Then learn the Greeks. Then learn the market. Then develop strategies. A normal mind is what needs to be changed if you want to understand options. But I don't know anything.
2021-04-26 19:45:54,wallstreetbets,"Go check out InTheMoney on Youtube, he covers it great and quickly."
2021-04-26 19:52:16,wallstreetbets,Hope they keep buying back :) another hedge fund about to close its doors.
2021-04-26 19:53:08,wallstreetbets,I see 100 as realistic. Especially if buy out news is released & they’re named a tech leader in their space.
2021-04-26 19:34:05,wallstreetbets,Thank you

2021-04-26 19:52:08,wallstreetbets,"This is what I'm doing, I can get $3c Jan'22 GSAT options for 18 cents right now. I can afford the $18 for 1 contract and see what happens.

Edited to add: I'm replying to the first paragraph you wrote"
2021-04-26 19:54:59,wallstreetbets,Dope. Thanks for that explanation. I thought I needed to have enough money on my account to cover the actual purchase of the 300 shares ( ur example) in order to get profit. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm). U da man. Thanks
2021-04-26 19:38:36,wallstreetbets,"Np. Good luck. If you decide to jump in, just remember that all of these “yolos” will be dumping soon. Just get out before they do 😉"
2021-04-26 19:57:41,wallstreetbets,"Do it, fugget. Thats how I lost my first $20 too! haha. Jan 22 is a good ways off and likely that something at least comes out of it at some point during the year. I started with ones expiring in 1 or 2 weeks and learned quickly not to do that again haha. They lose value quite quickly when the date is fast approaching and not an obvious trajectory towards being ITM."
2021-04-26 19:49:18,wallstreetbets,"While I agree that there will be profit taking by some, and that there will be an consolidation of the stock, but if you look at my average you'll see that I'm long on MVIS and this isn't a Yolo. I'm in till the buyout."
2021-04-26 19:39:30,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate that. I love learned that from a ton of other stocks on here, primarily gme lol"
2021-04-26 19:56:52,wallstreetbets,Same I seen 108 for buy out.
2021-04-26 19:40:23,wallstreetbets,Perhaps additional short positions were opened because the stock rallied 300% in a week? Couldn’t be
2021-04-26 19:29:05,wallstreetbets,"Well, I cashed out an 85% gain in my trading account, & it bumped my kids ESAs up by $390.  Yes I realize these are tiny gains, but consider Im using borrowed money at the moment.  So, this is a big help to me, & my poor ass wants to thank all you crazy apes for turning me on to MVIS.  Im gonna keep putting money in to work, & following everyone here.  Many thanks to all of you for giving me a hand up!"
2021-04-26 19:26:31,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t be shocked if a ton of people covered. That AH spike was ridiculous.
2021-04-26 19:03:47,wallstreetbets,I’m betting it doesn’t get shorted. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
2021-04-26 19:31:38,wallstreetbets,Literally bought calls 10 minutes before close and sold it 5 minutes before close cause I paper handed. Only to see this and the stock shoot up in AH. Literally retarded god I hope I never have to explain my transaction history to anyone 😂😂😂
2021-04-26 19:24:02,wallstreetbets,20%? Those are rookie numbers
2021-04-26 19:39:21,wallstreetbets,Every company ever listed is now a short squeeze
2021-04-26 19:50:00,wallstreetbets,APES FOUND THEIR NEXT TARGET. HHHHOOOOOOOLLLLLLDDDD & Buy all the shares you can:) 100+ coming to your wallet soon
2021-04-26 19:37:37,wallstreetbets,Idk what I'm doing...smooth brained 🦍 but made 1600 today and a few hundred a month ago which is good for me. Been swinging with Mavis for a couple months now. Im waiting for the dip to jump back in. Maybe it won't happen but I'm happy with my little bitto tendies for now.
2021-04-26 19:06:48,wallstreetbets,"I’m confused by what this means, I’m just getting into stocks"

2021-04-26 19:40:12,wallstreetbets,"Some idiots bet on falling prices. Just too bad if prices aren't falling.

Back in early 2020 Tesla was the NYSE's most shorted stock with an short interest of 18%. 20% is considered to be very high.

GameStop was about 140% short."
2021-04-26 19:28:50,wallstreetbets,"Shorting is when an investor borrows shares of a stock and sells them. You do this when you expect the stock to go down. If it does, you can pick them up cheaper, and give them back, keeping the difference. Borrowed and sold at $100. Replaced at $90. Kept $10 profit.

When you make this sort of deal you need to replace the shares you borrowed in a certain time period, say a few days or weeks or months. If the stock goes up, you’ll be facing having to buy it for more than you sold it for, eating the loss. If it goes up a lot you might not even have enough money to replace the shares you borrowed. You could hope it goes back down, but that doesn’t help if it doesn’t go back down before your contract expires. 20% of of MVIS has been borrowed and sold by someone who is now in just this predicament. The more people who buy it, the harder it is for the short sellers to replace their borrowed stocks. Hence why everyone here is buying it right now. 

Not financial advice - just answering the question. Someone’s gotta lose $1 for someone else to make $1 just the same. How many losers will be hedge funds losing on their shorts, and how many will be redditers who bought at the top? We’ll see."

2021-04-26 19:28:21,wallstreetbets,Sounds as convincing as my cousin in early Feb that said they're up 200% and can only go up from there. No basis. I wish you luck on your play though.
2021-04-26 18:47:22,wallstreetbets,"Whether you have to pay qrtly or not is a function of what your final tax due is as compared to your withholding throughout the year.  If your withholding isn't high enough, again, based on your final tax due for year, then you will be assessed penalties and interest for under withholding.

If you're making 10s of Ks in stock trades (gains) through the year, then you might want to talk to a CPA.

Haven't done taxes in a very long time, but that's the gist of it."
2021-04-26 18:30:19,wallstreetbets,End of year is what you owe capital gains taxes on as you don't know final profit or loss yet. But it wouldn't hurt to set aside your potential tax payments quarterly if you're worried about it.
2021-04-26 18:44:29,wallstreetbets,"It's funny, I've only been trading for a few months too and I know more about taxes than options"
2021-04-26 19:25:18,wallstreetbets,All mvis did is put me back to where I purchased them 2 months ago. Still nice though haha.

2021-04-26 19:38:05,wallstreetbets,Most of my research was based on what people in the yahoo stock message board were saying under the MVIS ticker. I am good investor.
2021-04-26 18:50:25,wallstreetbets,"It does come down to whether you owe at the end of the year. If you owed >$1k at the end of the year, there is a penalty. There are many strategies to deal with taxes. Have more taken out of your job's paycheck or pay quarterly, for example. 


Keep this up, and you should probably pay quarterly.  

Check with r/tax to be sure."

2021-04-26 18:38:04,wallstreetbets,Just remember to sell
2021-04-26 18:36:28,wallstreetbets,Literally same. Sold n now hold $30 calls
2021-04-26 18:33:03,wallstreetbets,I was going to buy calls last week. I snoozed so I lose lol. I have 34 shares though.
2021-04-26 18:18:56,wallstreetbets,Congrats!!
2021-04-26 19:33:10,wallstreetbets,Oh no
2021-04-26 18:26:51,wallstreetbets,Can you show me how?
2021-04-26 19:16:13,wallstreetbets,You son of a bitch👏
2021-04-26 18:19:24,wallstreetbets,How early did you get in on that?
2021-04-26 18:40:46,wallstreetbets,My first one cost me the same as most of the others. I suck at options.
2021-04-26 19:12:35,wallstreetbets,YES
2021-04-26 19:45:14,wallstreetbets,I lost like 40 bucks on my first option which is a lot for me considering I was at 120 I made 10 bucks back though in the past week because stocks are easy
2021-04-26 18:42:46,wallstreetbets,If you sell don't you have to own the stock to cover if the buyer exercised the option? Or am I full of baloney?
2021-04-26 19:01:01,wallstreetbets,"I would prob recommend selling, right? 

Wouldn’t it be good to sell for $10k. Then buy for example 4 $30 calls for $4k & profit 6k?

I imagine this single $15 can net more than 4 @ $30. But at least you guarantee cash. 

This is kind of a recommendation to OP. As well a question to the one I’m replying too.

I’ve done well so far options trading, learned to cash in those profits quickly. Just started a few months ago myself. I like to hit CLF, that’s kinda my go to poor man calls"

2021-04-26 19:18:03,wallstreetbets,"What's your brokerage? 

Also, this was a tiny bit lucky and not a daily thing you can pull off regularly on the fly. I cleaned up on my virgin call too but its been like 70-30 since with not-so-heavy returns at times, and there is a touch of luck to the timing of shit. I'm down to show you what I know and have learned so far if you want."
2021-04-26 18:31:55,wallstreetbets,I second this as someone with the interest and capital try.. I would like to lose or win idc just wanna try it with something that’s actually going to budge
2021-04-26 18:21:31,wallstreetbets,Wednesday when it was around $12. I thought it was going to just hit $17 so I just bought calls.....I think I was wrong
2021-04-26 18:51:18,wallstreetbets,"He bought the call. It gives him the right to buy 100 shares at the strike price. But he doesn't have to do that. He can sell the option.

And yeah, you're mixed up. Buying a call means you think the stock will go up. A $10 call means at expiry you can (but don't have to) buy 100 shares for $10. If it's trading at $20, you made money. 

But you never have to exercise. He can sell the option for it's market worth at any time."
2021-04-26 18:49:16,wallstreetbets,He probably bought a call and sold it later. You have to own the stock only if you write the option yourself (covered calls and puts).
2021-04-26 19:37:42,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino. Are you going all in on red or black?"
2021-04-26 18:48:23,wallstreetbets,"Hell yeah, congrats!"
2021-04-26 18:53:55,wallstreetbets,Well I guess I need to get into options trading
2021-04-26 18:58:40,wallstreetbets,Anybody have a good introduction to call options? I get how they work in theory but when I look into doing some of my own suddenly my brain forgets how numbers work and short circuits trying to piece everything together
2021-04-26 18:52:55,wallstreetbets,God this stuff is so much voodoo to me and yes I've been studying all I can find about it. So if I buy a call option on robinhood I can sell at any time and that's that?
2021-04-26 19:38:13,wallstreetbets,Green plz
2021-04-26 18:57:45,wallstreetbets,Great plan if you want to watch your money piss away

2021-04-26 19:14:51,wallstreetbets,Go buy a spy call for exp 4/30 for $60. And if it hits for $100+ just think if you would have bought 10 or 25.
2021-04-26 18:56:27,wallstreetbets,As long as someone's buying yup
2021-04-26 19:31:59,wallstreetbets,"That's why you never put all your eggs in one basket. I spread out my option dates. One or two contracts for one date, few others for another date, etc. If I get the itch to do a weekly option, I only get like one or two at most."
2021-04-26 19:03:01,wallstreetbets,I understand the risk involved and I never gamble more than I can afford to lose.
2021-04-26 18:59:21,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I get that much, have to find a buyer."
2021-04-26 19:45:14,wallstreetbets,"Also worth mentioning, calls/puts can't be sold/bought in pre/postmarket."
2021-04-26 19:46:25,wallstreetbets,"I rarely trade in those windows anyway but good info, thanks"
2021-04-26 19:08:21,wallstreetbets,why are my may 21 calls not printing? why?

2021-04-26 17:56:27,wallstreetbets,HF and overall bears have proven to be as equally retarded by still holding Shorts and Puts on a Stock owned in majority by retail. Especially AMC on that matter. They are digging themselves in a bigger hole.

This subreddit has unintentionally used the word ""retard"" to convince HF's that we may actually be mentally challenged, so to them, it's like being the smartest kid in the special ed class. They keep doing the same thing hoping they can rely on your goldfish-like memory. What they don't realize, is that only 75% of this subreddit is medically retarded and forgot to sell at $483. I don't even want tendies anymore. This is just like an arcade game, I put my $250 into the coin slot once a week just to play, I don't expect to win anything."

2021-04-26 18:47:46,wallstreetbets,"Because apparently they were gradually selling shares for awhile. It’s likely apart of the constant downward pressure during the past weeks making it trade sideways. Now that is gone, there seems to be more upward pressure."

2021-04-26 18:21:47,wallstreetbets,"You may be onto something. VIAC dumped because why, exactly? Following the trend over the last year, it's low. I think the price will oscillate a bit until it settles back into a steady upward trend, unless earnings are ridiculously good or bad."

2021-04-26 17:48:46,wallstreetbets,I’m pretty sure zjz is Cramer.
2021-04-26 17:46:42,wallstreetbets,"A bit of backstory:

I propose a general stop to using the phrase ""yolo"".

Investing is an art, sometimes a science, which is focused on the careful allocation of risk units in exchange for reward units. The smart investor understands that he is always taking some sort of risk, even in Treasury bonds. That intelligent investor has made a careful assessment of the expected return and has thought through the risk being ""worth it"".

The ""YOLO"" term undermines the central point of investing. While it is tautological that one only lives once, your capital may die a premature and permanent death. This ""roll the dice"" mentality is amateurish: I have never heard it in 15 years on Wall Street.

Investing can be exciting, and that can be a good thing. But simply searching for thrills is unwise. You can Bloomberg search for stocks with the highest implied volatility and flip coins on binary events and earnings announcements for a living, if you'd like. It doesn't lead to outsized returns.

Last year I made a very big bet on a biotech company called Celladon, earning over $20,0000,000 in my personal account. I was pleased but this was not a ""YOLO"" moment. I thought carefully about the embarrassment and ramifications of LOSING $20,000,000. I researched the situation for months until I felt comfortable I knew more about this company's drug than the company did. I was right and slept sound. No YOLO.

Becoming wealthy is difficult and requires immense patience. This ""yolo"" attitude discourages this perspective. Remember that the world's best fundamental (non-quantitative, non-insider trading) investors are making 15% returns (at best) in the current era. You will need a large starting capital base to become wealthy. Those investors are not simply in stodgy old-line stocks that prevent their returns from being large. They are appropriately (usually inappropriately, actually) measuring the tradeoff of risk units for return units and trying to make as much money as possible. No hedge fund manager would deny themselves a 100% year, but most do as the necessary risk to achieve that kind of return will subject a portfolio to disappearing.

I hope these thoughts are helpful as you pursue your investment careers.

2021-04-26 18:49:12,wallstreetbets,slightly more conservative approach meaning you spent $320 per contract on a position that was 100% out of the money betting on a catalyst which we'll know if it'll pay off in a matter of a few months and if it doesn't the stock will tank..?

My question is to what extent has this been priced in?

2021-04-26 17:04:16,wallstreetbets,"Also, something I didn't mentioned that I found interesting, the company is owned primarily by insiders, usually with small pharma companies the founder and insiders have long since sold off the majority of their shares, it seems those in the company believe in the success of the drug enough to gamble most of their net worth on it."

Look at any pharm company developing a single drug, they burn cash for years until they get to this point, the NDA filing and FDA approval. The risk here is they may do another offering in December before the FDA approves the drug. Best case scenario the sell the patent before that point"

Lets say is is only approved to be combined with C-GSF in breast cancer patients and no other and remove China from the population since the company only owns 51% of the rights in China. There are roughly 290,000 cases of breast cancer a year with 50,000 requiring chemo, that will be our target population. Patients tend to get about 3 cycles of chemo when its needed, so 50,000 x 3 doses. C-GSF, a 30 year old drug makes 6,500 a dose, 19500 a patient. In total about 1 billion a year. Conservative estimate, lets say the brand new drug plinabulin gets 6,500 per dose, 1 billion a year on this extremely conservative patient population. Taking another conservative estimate, 30% of those 50,000 patients will receive it, personally I think it will be standard of care to combine it with every dose of G-CSF but lets be conservative, it puts revenue at 300 million a year, for a company valued at 400 million. 3X peak sales for company valuation (again conservative, biopharm sometimes uses 4-5x peak sales) places an estimated valuation at 900 million, so more than double the current value. Now letting out imagination run wild, we open it to the Chinese population as well and open it to every patient who recieved G-CSF we receive a yearly revenue in the billions for the CIN use, with a company valuation over 10 billion. This is only for the CIN use, there is a non zero chance that the chemo use of the drug is approved as well following good results later this year, that would instantly skyrocket the company a few tens of billion in valuation.

2021-04-26 19:45:49,wallstreetbets,"CIN isn’t something I deal with in my specialty but if the standard therapy becomes G CSF + this drug then that would be pretty big. 

And to be fair I need to do some more thorough DD on the studies to see the design and the magnitude of the the therapeutic affect."
2021-04-26 17:29:20,wallstreetbets,"Ya, the stock offerings did some damage and their management is pretty shit at PR, but they finally limped to the end and filed their NDA, the actual market cap of the company has not changed much"
2021-04-26 16:37:37,wallstreetbets,"Lil bit of A lil bit of B. Probably more since its a pharma stock under the cap, double the risk, double the fun"
2021-04-26 19:49:55,wallstreetbets,"When combined its a bit over 50% more effective than G-CSF alone, which is a pretty nice improvement. They lay out some of the basics in the press release given out with the NDA filing.



 

The application is based on findings from the phase 3 PROTECTIVE-2 trial (Study 106; NCT03294577), which showed that the combination of plinabulin and pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) was 53% more effective in reducing CIN incidence than pegfilgrastim alone in patients who were undergoing chemotherapy.2

The incidence of profound neutropenia was 21.6% with the combination vs 46.4% with pegfilgrastim alone (*P* = .0001) in patients with breast cancer who are undergoing a chemotherapy regimen comprised of docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC). The combination also resulted in a 41% reduction in the risk of febrile neutropenia vs pegfilgrastim alone, based on a reduction of profound neutropenia.

2021-04-26 17:30:17,wallstreetbets,Elaborate on why you favor this share class of the stock. I don’t disagree with you. I have the same theory on VIAC and opened 3 short $40 6/18 puts and 1 long $42 1/2023 call last week.
2021-04-26 17:05:15,wallstreetbets,pls fix
2021-04-26 18:03:17,wallstreetbets,I favor VIAC over DISC even though both went through the Archegos fiasco. VIAC has so much going for it with P+ and the new Avatar Studios with its cult following. I think it has room to grow beyond the $50-$60 range in the next year.
2021-04-26 18:41:54,wallstreetbets,"Same here; long on VIAC but will have to be patient.  Both of these are severely undervalued right now. I have more faith in VIAC too, but DISC is in similar position and I'm not sure why people are still nervous about buying."

2021-04-26 18:33:56,wallstreetbets,I am dead inside
2021-04-26 17:57:01,wallstreetbets,TSLA has mastered the art of making money from non core business.  The revenue from regulatory credits jumped 46% to $518 million and recorded $272 million proceeds from sales of digital assets.
2021-04-26 16:11:37,wallstreetbets,flat? wtf
2021-04-26 16:13:46,wallstreetbets,+1% -1% +0.56% -0.43% +0.32% +0.45% -0.34% -1.4%
2021-04-26 16:44:52,wallstreetbets,I expected a rally in the after market lol. Deceived nicely
2021-04-26 17:13:39,wallstreetbets,To everyone who are complaining that the stock is not going up despite being a beat. You have to remember that Tesla beat the expectations more then 50% of the time so you have to do more then beat for it to go up.
2021-04-26 16:16:32,wallstreetbets,WHY IS THE STOCK NOT MOVING WTF
2021-04-26 16:47:39,wallstreetbets,Short on tesla and get money
2021-04-26 16:26:31,wallstreetbets,Tesla earnings a total non event. Think the momentum in that stock is over.
2021-04-26 16:28:52,wallstreetbets,I am sorry for those who turned all Portfolio to TSLA yesterday hope they can manage to sell without big loss tomorrow...
2021-04-26 16:12:22,wallstreetbets,"So is a TSLA beat good, bad, or neutral for my NIO calls?"
2021-04-26 16:29:55,wallstreetbets,Priced In
2021-04-26 16:20:16,wallstreetbets,"For those who bought TSLA calls thinking it would go up a significant amount after earnings, good job. Next time, look up ""priced in"" and ""IV crush"""
2021-04-26 16:30:19,wallstreetbets,"lmfao still unprofitable without regulatory credits

hell of a growth stock"
2021-04-26 16:11:34,wallstreetbets,Wow they just blew it away 🚀🚀🚀

2021-04-26 16:25:19,wallstreetbets,Maybe it's priced in since it's up almost 25% the last month.
2021-04-26 16:19:39,wallstreetbets,"I had a notification pop up that literally said “TSLA blows away earnings expectations!  Stock down $8 post market.”

Is this manipulation or is there something else that causes this?"
2021-04-26 16:31:22,wallstreetbets,Fffffff
2021-04-26 16:38:01,wallstreetbets,Why did it dip like that?
2021-04-26 17:11:26,wallstreetbets,I'm ignoring everyone else who said it was priced in and listening to you
2021-04-26 18:27:43,wallstreetbets,"How much would they have to price the cars at to make up for the credits? Like, if the credits went away 100% how much would a Model 3 have to cost for Tesla to have the same financials?"
2021-04-26 16:12:45,wallstreetbets,Everyone expected this beat. Stock will move on next quarter guidance and Gigi factory update during the call.
2021-04-26 16:23:01,wallstreetbets,Oh it’s moving alright...not in my favor.
2021-04-26 16:24:17,wallstreetbets,First time?
2021-04-26 16:46:59,wallstreetbets,because this was already priced in.
2021-04-26 16:23:45,wallstreetbets,NIO will fly regardless
2021-04-26 16:23:17,wallstreetbets,Good in that maybe it’s a sign of the industry as whole but it could be bad because it could mean less profit for NIO
2021-04-26 16:39:35,wallstreetbets,Thanks
2021-04-26 16:46:17,wallstreetbets,Actually .39 is GAAP EPS.  .93 is Non gaap
2021-04-26 16:34:20,wallstreetbets,But it was down 40% prior to it going up 25%...
2021-04-26 16:32:31,wallstreetbets,"Yes. There is something that causes this 

When the stock has rallied from $350 to $3500 in 12 months youve pulled away future growth to the present 

They had good numbers but not spectacularly stellar numbers so the market sells it or trades it flat"
2021-04-26 16:21:58,wallstreetbets,"I think ""blows away"" is doing a lot of work here. The devil will be in the details, regardless, especially future guidance."
2021-04-26 16:43:00,wallstreetbets,"It will rally this week. I think those that don’t want to risk their $$ on a single call probably pulled out, and will Re buy tomorrow . Good profits = more investors."
2021-04-26 16:53:12,wallstreetbets,"From some of the analysis I’ve seen, many people thought it could’ve been as high as $1.14 EPS.

I’m still bullish on Tesla long term but a wee bit disappointed with Q1 Results."
2021-04-26 16:42:40,wallstreetbets,Probably lower than the whisper number
2021-04-26 17:41:59,wallstreetbets,Smart the only time it went up that I can recall was their first profitable quarter. Last year
2021-04-26 18:50:15,wallstreetbets,"You can't make that comparison, because Tesla is already missing out on $7,500 incentives per car compared to each of their competitors except for GM since they're at the 200,000 EVs sold cap.

You could look at what EV car prices should do if incentives were removed altogether, in which case Tesla's cars would have to increase $2,900 to maintain margins while their competitors would have to reduce their prices by $7,500 to maintain demand."
2021-04-26 16:16:01,wallstreetbets,"How’s that make sense 

Shouldn’t it rise with this report"
2021-04-26 16:19:06,wallstreetbets,giga factory updates are in the report. Don't expect any big move on any direction now.
2021-04-26 16:58:44,wallstreetbets,I want a refund
2021-04-26 16:58:53,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-04-26 16:58:38,wallstreetbets,This is bs I’m pissed
2021-04-26 16:37:48,wallstreetbets,"But it was up 1200% in a year prior to it going down 40%, which was prior to it going up 10%, then up another 25% recently."
2021-04-26 16:18:14,wallstreetbets,"The beat was expected, so it was priced in already."
2021-04-26 16:27:50,wallstreetbets,"What? Are you newer to trading? That is how all earnings reports work. People predict the report before the report comes out and make moves prior to the report release. So since it was widely expected that the numbers released would be what they were, people made moves accordingly and since the report didn’t have any surprises the stock is flat till the call."
2021-04-26 16:56:39,wallstreetbets,Everyone needs Elon on the phone before they optimism buy—just wait til about 30 min into the call.
2021-04-26 16:41:33,wallstreetbets,"Most companies beat estimates. It's setup that way with a purposely low bar.  If it was accurate it would be 50-50 on meeting expectations, but it's substantially higher rate of beating expectations than missing."
2021-04-26 16:35:53,wallstreetbets,Everything the company wants to say is in the report but the analyst questions that will help move the stock based on info they can extract about the gig factory updates could move it. It will move with the call just watch.
2021-04-26 16:33:19,wallstreetbets,"Beat the meat

Eat the meat"
2021-04-26 16:14:22,wallstreetbets,Can’t wait to see this keep growing. Great news on the horizon!!

2021-04-26 16:16:04,wallstreetbets,I was gonna wait but got back in 26.... with the fairly low float these people keep buying it could run hard.

My thoughts are these levels probably act as short term resistance, and i'll be looking for bounces in between for adding or trimming positions"

2021-04-26 16:50:30,wallstreetbets,"If a buyout is in the works you def have plenty of room for more growth. People are gearing up for big news Thursday, if that news comes expect 80+ a share. If it's no buyout and just good lidar demo news 45$ land is a modest valuation"

The tech will improve. Crashes will become less frequent.

Smoke til 165 internal on the thick cap then pull and wrap in butcher paper and continue to smoke until 204 internal. Pull it from the smoker and throw it in a cooler wrapped in towels to sit for 2-3 hours.  Then separate/slice the fat cap off horizontally from the flat and re spice and throw back on the smoker for a few hours to get burnt ends.

2021-04-26 18:33:42,wallstreetbets,What if MVIS was the missing piece to the margin call that sends GME and MVIS to the moon? There's room on both rockets.

2021-04-26 16:56:19,wallstreetbets,it’s more about the capital they raised. will help out the company transformation
2021-04-26 16:58:25,wallstreetbets,No? That was priced in when it was announced. Now it’s positive because they are debt free and have more cash on hand.
2021-04-26 16:56:01,wallstreetbets,I think it’s that they’re finished and the price didn’t crash
2021-04-26 17:01:57,wallstreetbets,"GME dropped by 5% when they announced the dilution, so it's priced in"
2021-04-26 17:00:45,wallstreetbets,It is positive news they are done selling. They announced the dilution a month or two back.
2021-04-26 17:02:25,wallstreetbets,"It is fundamentally good that they're debt free so I'd say that it diluted without decreasing the value held by each shares. 

The issue with GME as an investment is that there's a whole lot of irrationality governing its price action so I wouldn't do anything but trade it. And only that with the guidance of a master 🐐"

2021-04-26 16:53:24,wallstreetbets,"it was a relatively small offering.  I think the positive reaction here is because a major driver of built-in price uncertainty has been removed (i.e., ""they finished the offering and the price held up pretty well"").  Plus, now they have a ton of money to fuel the upcoming plans from Cohen."

2021-04-26 17:16:00,wallstreetbets,Everyone buy and hold. Social hype plus true good things coming with the new CEO is a recipe for a moon landing. They have 100% viable reasons for a full or partial buyout.

2021-04-26 19:47:47,wallstreetbets,AFRM is a great play. I’ve done a few trades in it since IPO and also think that this ticker still has legs to go far!
2021-04-26 19:38:02,wallstreetbets,Definitely one I’m eyeing. Bought in too early and sold to stack on some more MVIS shares a couple weeks back. Will likely buy back in once my capital is freed up
2021-04-26 19:55:31,wallstreetbets,Now probably
2021-04-26 17:48:14,wallstreetbets,Shut up lmao

2021-04-26 17:10:31,wallstreetbets,If gamestop sold shares would the price not go lower?
2021-04-26 18:21:01,wallstreetbets,Logic doesn't apply with this stock. Just buy at good price points and profit
2021-04-26 18:21:43,wallstreetbets,"A. Not the effects of it. It was a minimal offering compared to the float. And now GME will be debt free by 4/30 (utilizing cash already on hand) AND now Cohen has over $500 million to play with. Acquisition? Dividend to expose shorts? Any other number of things to increase value of stock to shareholders. 

B. So you do the logic from A."
2021-04-26 18:21:00,wallstreetbets,The offering closed today and they raised $551m.
2021-04-26 18:20:16,wallstreetbets,gme's price has nothing to do with the news. it's just apes and ppl who are taking advantage of all the dumb money flowing in. My guess is seeing MVIS go up got the FOMO kicking in.
2021-04-26 18:58:11,wallstreetbets,Then load up on some GME and MVIS and turn that frown upside down
2021-04-26 17:10:55,wallstreetbets,For a good reason
2021-04-26 17:38:36,wallstreetbets,"Yes, buy after it goes up 22% in one day!"
2021-04-26 17:35:52,wallstreetbets,You’re the same dumbass who proclaimed that GME would never again see above $100. Which proves how much you know Lmao.

2021-04-26 19:16:25,wallstreetbets,"Sideways Price Action Last Week

Hi guys executive ape here. Holding since January. 

This is not financial advice. I am retarded. I eat crayons. 

———————————————————————————

Ok. Last week the price moved sideways, ALL WEEK. Honesty I kind of enjoyed it. But wtf was the reason?

If it was GME slowly selling shares throughout the week for the offering, does that mean that the T+21 theory is not valid?

Today may have been the first day GME stopped selling shares for the offering. Removal of that selling pressure may have been the reason for the upward price action. 

If the reason why the stock price stayed low last week was in fact because of GME offering, then that means the shorts have tons of borrowed shares they didn’t have to use last week. Keep in mind, volume was next to nothing all week last week! 

I graduated from the University of Reddit in market analysis and know close to nothing about the stock market and how it works.

But based off 4 months of DD I have read; and despite the complete smoothness (bowling ball smooth) of my brain, I created this thought somehow. And if it holds any truth then that means SHORTS HAVE ALOT OF AMMO that they haven’t had to use. 

Now today I saw a lot of posts about the small to none amount of shares available to borrow. I have no idea what that means, but they might not need more borrowed shares, because they may have been stock piling the hundreds of thousands of shares/day for a bit of time now. 

I expect duckery as always. But if the price drops dramatically, I will always remember these key elements:

-GME is debt free
-GME has 600-700million cash on hand
-Shorts haven’t covered
-My wife’s boyfriend has a phenomenal jaw line 

I love GME, and I love the community that surrounds it. 

Have a great day apes 🦍"

2021-04-26 17:49:03,wallstreetbets,Makes sense.  But technical analysis is a funny thing.  It's like reading tea leaves.  Everybody sees something different.  A pennant which we have here works 2 ways. It can break out to the up side or the down side. Also tend lines soon by lost forever.  Usually a stock bounces off the line 2-4 times and then either breaks to the down side or goes flat.  I see two possibilities. A break hard to the down side.  I can real hy see it at 85 in a week.  Or it goes flat and trades in a range for days or weeks.  That's the scenario  I'm being on.

2021-04-26 18:25:39,wallstreetbets,How in the tits is this technical?
2021-04-26 18:28:17,wallstreetbets,I guess GME is suddenly OK to talk about now? I guess the sell out mods need more material for their movie
2021-04-26 18:39:34,wallstreetbets,"bro, i have 11 4/30 contracts @ 4.00 strike

AM I WINNING?!?!"
2021-04-26 18:56:01,wallstreetbets,"Isn't the short interest down to around 15%? I feel like this is going up based on the new fundamentals alone and is a good own without the squeeze. 

Just wondering if this is still possible to see margin calls as a result."

2021-04-26 19:53:24,wallstreetbets,Frightened ape here... I'm doing a transfer of assets right now from wells fargo to fidelity with my 30 shares. It says projected completion date is 4/30... I'm so afraid I'll miss the squeeze

I was a bit nervous at first, but then I remembered that no hype stocks go sideways for weeks before they crash. They build upward momentum by going sideays.

2021-04-26 17:16:19,wallstreetbets,"I think $CLOV is the big distraction operation.

How do I know? Mötley Fool has been writing a lot about it inbetween articles reminding you not to forget about forgetting about $GME. 

They said: ""For those who like to swim against the tide, Clover Health might be the healthcare stock to buy now."""
2021-04-26 17:25:21,wallstreetbets,"Lol bought some 5/21 $25C on MVIS on Friday. Sold today. Rolled all my profits into GME 200C 4/30

This has been a pretty great day"
2021-04-26 17:17:09,wallstreetbets,"I wasn’t a distraction, it was actually pretty good move and very foreseeable a few months ago, but GME is my child and i owe it 100% of my attention"
2021-04-26 16:45:47,wallstreetbets,For real  mvis sounds like a distraction for gme
2021-04-26 19:42:51,wallstreetbets,I made $300 on $MVIS today so I don't mind the distraction lol
2021-04-26 18:46:09,wallstreetbets,I sold mvic calls for nice 300% profit. Then bought gme $420 7/16 calls when price was around $152 this morning. Felt pretty good about it.

2021-04-26 17:27:22,wallstreetbets,That was the bait and switch they let that run up BASED on the information they spread on here about MVIS hoping we would get paper hands and sell to get hundreds rather than millions. So while everyone was watching MVIS boom this is going to the moon
2021-04-26 19:36:55,wallstreetbets,I'm so pissed I'm holding only 2 in mvis.
2021-04-26 18:32:16,wallstreetbets,No way. Same day stick and poke.
2021-04-26 16:21:53,wallstreetbets,And then you would get fucked because you shorted GME
2021-04-26 19:43:46,wallstreetbets,Reminds me of those ‘20 ways Bernie can still win!’ memes.
2021-04-26 19:56:27,wallstreetbets,"It was such a boss ass move they quietly did over a couple/few weeks. I think shorts were salivating thinking about getting more shares in the market with it and got hoodwinked. In short, everyone kept retarding into these cheaper shares, GME eliminates its long term debt while also accumulating 330 mill. You can’t look at these financials and say shit at this point. There’s virtually no bear thesis."
2021-04-26 18:04:59,wallstreetbets,I've noticed that the money offering and this recent sideways GME action have coincided fairly well. Today the money offering was completed and today we start shooting up.
2021-04-26 18:03:21,wallstreetbets,Stock astrology.
2021-04-26 17:04:38,wallstreetbets,"It's just lines. Doesn't mean anything. Some people think that if you're able to draw lines in a specific way, the stock will go up."
2021-04-26 17:48:30,wallstreetbets,Literally means nothing. He has arrows and circles
2021-04-26 18:56:19,wallstreetbets,"This isn't even ""real"" TA. He just circled some pivot lows, drew a completely incorrect fib retracement, and then some random arrows."
2021-04-26 17:13:49,wallstreetbets,So the line would be referred to as an ascending (going up) line of support (floor where a stock might bounce based on history). The last two times the day patterns were similar leading up to the day it hit those lows and the had drastic increases within the next couple days. So just look at the points where the line touches and the pattern within his circles is all it’s showing.
2021-04-26 16:44:41,wallstreetbets,10m or no deal
2021-04-26 16:30:38,wallstreetbets,10 mil

2021-04-26 19:30:10,wallstreetbets,"At the bell tomorrow, buy GME."
2021-04-26 19:29:56,wallstreetbets,Buy 60 shares tomorrow at open
2021-04-26 17:18:44,wallstreetbets,"10 mill, I thought we all understood this is the floor"
2021-04-26 17:19:54,wallstreetbets,Hold until infinity dollars
2021-04-26 18:47:07,wallstreetbets,Of course. It’s a long term play at this price point. Or obviously the squeeze happens. Either way it’s a win.
2021-04-26 18:42:37,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you're about two centuries too late, assuming you're in the US."
2021-04-26 18:24:30,wallstreetbets,IT'S GOING TO DROP TO IT'S TRUE VALUE OF $20 ANYDAY NOW!!!
2021-04-26 18:13:32,wallstreetbets,"Because today the price went up, which is quite rare lately.  So that must mean it will go up forever."
2021-04-26 18:22:39,wallstreetbets,Didn't this thing go to from like $60 > $320 a months ago in a matter of an hour 2 months go and here we are? How quickly we forget...
2021-04-26 18:43:19,wallstreetbets,LMAO
2021-04-26 19:06:16,wallstreetbets,"No bro ! It’s going to a million ! The DD said so ! 

Own 1000 shares at $345."
2021-04-26 17:18:42,wallstreetbets,I think it’s tradingview
2021-04-26 17:31:44,wallstreetbets,Damn straight.
2021-04-26 17:51:33,wallstreetbets,Get that corn outta my face!
2021-04-26 18:29:06,wallstreetbets,Meaning I accept your offer of 69k/share
2021-04-26 18:40:45,wallstreetbets,Great album
2021-04-26 18:49:54,wallstreetbets,Imagine 300m
2021-04-26 19:01:33,wallstreetbets,It’ll take a couple days to reach 10M anyway
2021-04-26 19:18:02,wallstreetbets,"Ditto, started my transfer Sunday. Literally told some friends ""Just watch, it'll squeeze the second I start getting off RH and move it over to my real broker account."" 

Maybe... we were the catalyst all along..."
2021-04-26 19:29:16,wallstreetbets,Multiple technical analyses posted here pointing to a jump between 350 and 520 in the immediate future. Do what you will with that info
2021-04-26 16:50:14,wallstreetbets,Yeah I can’t wait to buy lots of cheap pltr tsla and Arkg after gme is fully squeezed
2021-04-26 16:13:32,wallstreetbets,Every stock is next! The entire market is buttclenched because they are withholding our tendies!!
2021-04-26 19:35:03,wallstreetbets,What do you expect from a bunch of retards?
2021-04-26 18:34:08,wallstreetbets,Scorpio Full moon right now
2021-04-26 19:12:44,wallstreetbets,Yes. Many naked shorts.

2021-04-26 18:35:13,wallstreetbets,"Erase everything from ""understand..."" to ""...wanna""."
2021-04-26 19:29:19,wallstreetbets,"When did they do this? Today?

Isn't this supposed to increase the float and go down in value?"
2021-04-26 17:42:27,wallstreetbets,Bro it just jumped 18$
2021-04-26 19:58:35,wallstreetbets,"You’ll be fine. Mine took 2 days, squeeze should last at least 3 days"
2021-04-26 18:31:59,wallstreetbets,Yeah
2021-04-26 18:54:09,wallstreetbets,Soo.. when was the last time this made a higher high?
2021-04-26 19:11:40,wallstreetbets,"Just because the cult is big enough to keep it floating around this level for now doesn't mean it's not a cult. 90% of the bullshit labelled ""technical analysis"" or ""due diligence"" here is just straight up wrong."
2021-04-26 16:36:25,wallstreetbets,Yah fam.
2021-04-26 18:29:07,wallstreetbets,Still here. I didnt know $200 was your squeeze goal.
2021-04-26 17:57:02,wallstreetbets,"Second to tendies, this is the sweetest part"
2021-04-26 19:55:01,wallstreetbets,hey... who rustled this guy's jimmies?
2021-04-26 19:37:45,wallstreetbets,Post positions or stop babbling
2021-04-26 18:44:18,wallstreetbets,Gloat much?
2021-04-26 18:30:47,wallstreetbets,There it is. The dumbest comment I've seen today.
2021-04-26 19:19:50,wallstreetbets,"The believed mechanism the hedge funds have been using to avoid covering their shorts cycles every 21 days. Today was the 21st day in the cycle, so they were forced to purchase deep In the market calls to reset their Fails to Deliver (FTDs) on their shorts. This results in other players buying gme to delta hedge against the deep ITM calls. This isn’t the squeeze. Unless a ton of people FOMO in, or some whales decide to fuck over the shorts, driving the price up over 400, we won’t see the squeeze tomorrow either. But it’s a nice confirmation that we are on the right track in regards to understanding the hedge fund fuckery. 

It’s also important to note that this T+21 strat gets more expensive to maintain each time they do it because they have to aggressively short on other days to keep the price down, so it might slowly build to a margin call without any real catalyst."
2021-04-26 17:29:40,wallstreetbets,No one tell him
2021-04-26 17:10:28,wallstreetbets,420.69

2021-04-26 17:23:27,wallstreetbets,🦆💪
2021-04-26 17:43:00,wallstreetbets,Nah. Corporate was probably the one holding it at $155 all this time. The good news about it is that the company no longer has long term debt.
2021-04-26 17:43:39,wallstreetbets,They owe way more than 3.5M shares
2021-04-26 18:23:55,wallstreetbets,Am I too late to jump on the rocket ship?
2021-04-26 18:53:03,wallstreetbets,TradingView I believe

2021-04-26 18:57:52,wallstreetbets,They have been selling them over the course of the month.
2021-04-26 19:04:55,wallstreetbets,Papa Cohen laid his plan to bring back the company.  What’s the plan? No idea. I’ve just been holding for months now.
2021-04-26 19:25:33,wallstreetbets,The best time was yesterday. The second best time is (tomorrow).
2021-04-26 19:25:38,wallstreetbets,depends on if we can make it over $200
2021-04-26 19:41:00,wallstreetbets,Samesies
2021-04-26 19:36:15,wallstreetbets,"Not too late to buy some, you won’t regret it"
2021-04-26 17:42:16,wallstreetbets,Bruh... Smh
2021-04-26 16:51:50,wallstreetbets,did you look at the chart retard?
2021-04-26 17:43:18,wallstreetbets,Oh you mean delaying the inevitable and giving us a fire sale. Sure I don't mind.
2021-04-26 17:51:48,wallstreetbets,I hope no one FOMO'd the price up to $200 today. That would suck.
2021-04-26 18:01:07,wallstreetbets,"OH, I forgot to mention they have the patent on CBD Inhalers"
2021-04-26 18:43:32,wallstreetbets,"You've been away, huh?"
2021-04-26 19:34:27,wallstreetbets,Someone miss out?
2021-04-26 19:36:15,wallstreetbets,No way this guy fucks
2021-04-26 17:30:23,wallstreetbets,Yet we’re up on After Hours
2021-04-26 19:12:21,wallstreetbets,It would be a good play now if it squeezes.
2021-04-26 17:24:07,wallstreetbets,"Please don't, there is always a next dip to buy and/or a next opportunity. And if it goes to 1000$+ 165 or 250$ doesn't make much of a difference"
2021-04-26 18:56:41,wallstreetbets,If it reaches 10k a share I will tattoo my cock into whatever you choose.
2021-04-26 18:52:41,wallstreetbets,Likely not many. Only 3.5 million shares. They are short muuuuch more than that. Retail already owns the available float and then some. It's going to be a spicy week ahead
2021-04-26 17:28:06,wallstreetbets,Making my first mortgage payment this week. Imagine if that first payment was the only payment.
2021-04-26 17:24:45,wallstreetbets,I need a $17000 to be debt free. beyond that… Glory be.
2021-04-26 17:26:00,wallstreetbets,Mortgage and student loans! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
2021-04-26 17:18:28,wallstreetbets,Me too
2021-04-26 19:20:47,wallstreetbets,Why on earth would you do that? You realize you can make more investing that same money than your mortgage costs you in interest right? Likely a 10% spread on average annually.
2021-04-26 18:32:41,wallstreetbets,I want a mortgage
2021-04-26 18:36:42,wallstreetbets,Mortgage and school loans got a foot on my and my fiancée’s necks. Imagine the relief without these loans
2021-04-26 19:14:22,wallstreetbets,"Stop thinking so small.  You’re paying off your mortgage, then moving in to a bigger house, straight cash, baby."
2021-04-26 19:38:51,wallstreetbets,Just wanna pay the wife's mortgage do she can move the boyfriend in. I'm relocating to the moon.

2021-04-26 18:35:22,wallstreetbets,"Depending on the situation it's usually advisable to invest that money in other places and make it work for you instead of paying off a low interest loan. I totally understand wanting to get out from under any and all debt though, and not have a mortgage payment."
2021-04-26 18:36:09,wallstreetbets,"all i wanted was new golf clubs,  and i got those already but still have xxx shares...

2021-04-26 19:02:46,wallstreetbets,"I totally agree with you on wanting to pay off the mortgage. But I’ll be holding well after the point I can do that because I greatly want to be able to do good for others along with doing good for myself. 

Factor in extra money for taxes and everything, too. My floor is well above my mortgage."
2021-04-26 19:11:44,wallstreetbets,Same!!!
2021-04-26 19:14:48,wallstreetbets,I gave you 666 mark of the beast for good luck.  No more upvotes in respect.

2021-04-26 18:52:14,wallstreetbets,The numbers at this point don’t really matter until they get margin called in my opinion. I buy anything less than $200 when I can.

2021-04-26 17:40:16,wallstreetbets,"And also just look at what Jim Cramer said about MVIS, a strong don't buy (He said that when it was at $10/share last week)."
2021-04-26 18:25:23,wallstreetbets,Sounds like you just refueled for GME
2021-04-26 17:45:40,wallstreetbets,Same here. No other stock has the potential GME has. I made 2.5k on mvis and sold at 26 today and bought gme
2021-04-26 16:52:33,wallstreetbets,Maybe it's just me but I'm fine with getting distracted if it means getting distracted by money and 3x gains
2021-04-26 16:57:21,wallstreetbets,Lol not every major event is a distraction from GME. MVIS and GME can blow up together.
2021-04-26 17:37:21,wallstreetbets,"It's not, there was some really good DD when it hit its first ATH. I'm in on both, GME heavily, and it's awesome"
2021-04-26 17:45:14,wallstreetbets,Nar people are more that capable of having several stonks in the portfolio at once without getting distracted
2021-04-26 18:20:45,wallstreetbets,"Solid DD for MVIS, I bought and sold small amount for fun, will buy again after squeeze. Read the DD and come up with price for yourself to invest in after moon. One thing I’ve learned from GME is there are many undervalued stocks out there and don’t get too greedy."
2021-04-26 19:37:07,wallstreetbets,"Long on MVIS, def not a distraction. Serious DD in that sub!"
2021-04-26 17:34:19,wallstreetbets,"MVIS is just a fuel resupply for GME, don't hate."

2021-04-26 17:58:43,wallstreetbets,"> if you're able to draw lines in a specific way, the stock will go up.

but if im able to draw lines going up the stock will have gone up"
2021-04-26 19:06:50,wallstreetbets,I'm kind of astounded that everyone here thinks highlighting bounces on a trendline is something particularly complicated or absurd.

And if it doesn’t, let me tell you the day after that is gonna be like...whoa.

2021-04-26 19:59:45,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, that is good to know. The funny thing is, I had a feeling the second I sent my shares into cyberspace that GME would begin to climb lol"
2021-04-26 19:33:54,wallstreetbets,"This photo for instance proved nothing. 

And in a couple days nothing in this stock sill have changed"
2021-04-26 19:04:32,wallstreetbets,"I mean he has a point. I've been in since January for the squeeze and the RC story, and though I can agree lots of GME hypers are pretty annoying every time we have a $2 jump up ""OMG IS THIS IT?!"" and a $2 decline ""OMG I feel sick."", so many people come in here and just shit on their parade. Nay sayers should just mind their business and stay out of GME threads. Here's to gains for everyone!

2021-04-26 17:07:51,wallstreetbets,Yes.
2021-04-26 17:36:53,wallstreetbets,I'd be iffy on paying it all off right up front like that with the rates where they are right now.  Unless you don't think you can earn 4% ROI you're better off keeping some balance on there and putting the money you would use to pay it off into a relatively safe investment where you're confident you can earn an average of 4% or more over a 30 year span.
2021-04-26 17:29:57,wallstreetbets,Holy shit that would be fucking sick.
2021-04-26 17:30:35,wallstreetbets,This is the vibe.
2021-04-26 18:32:10,wallstreetbets,What a mind fuck that would be to your mortgage lender. 😂

2021-04-26 18:41:05,wallstreetbets,Right there with you fellow ape. $250k for house and $130k for my wife and my student loans! They can't hold us down
2021-04-26 18:45:48,wallstreetbets,I will be doing the same and hoping for the same
2021-04-26 18:53:49,wallstreetbets,We just bought a car this weekend. Said the same thing.
2021-04-26 18:58:51,wallstreetbets,This is the dream
2021-04-26 19:04:28,wallstreetbets,I would demand you cover your Dick in sharpie and mush that motherfucker into the notes line
2021-04-26 19:11:37,wallstreetbets,Don't make that payment.  Buy GME FDs instead.  Regardless of what happens your mortgage problem is solved.

2021-04-26 19:25:26,wallstreetbets,Closing in 3 days!
2021-04-26 19:35:04,wallstreetbets,Your lender would be very disappointed because he/she didn't get the opportunity to feed you to fannie mae. Prolly bad ass for your credit score tho.

2021-04-26 17:39:25,wallstreetbets,dont pay off loans at least until payments resume next fall.  if they weren't seriously considering it they would have stopped talking about it by now.
2021-04-26 18:43:25,wallstreetbets,I often think about that — imagine how relieving it would be to have no real monthly debt obligations. What would that even be like?! Amazing.

If you compare $MVIS to similar stocks that where trading at $0.XX at the same time, you'll see how they all kinda mirror each other. Most of them have been absolutely wrecked but $MVIS survived and is now mooning. Besides, this sub has had a thing for $MVIS for a while even before $GME.

I doubt $MVIS was intended to be a distraction but I do think $CLOV is sus."

Not to mention over the life of the loan you pay like 100% interest of the amount borrowed unless you pay extra every month. Why would I pay them that much when I can pay it off and start investing that monthly amount. It'd take a while to build but I'd be willing to bet that in the long run it would work out better in your favor."
2021-04-26 18:20:00,wallstreetbets,"Can you find another place to borrow hundreds of thousands of dollars for less than 4% APR?  No?  Don’t pay off early. I can pay my mortgage off, but it’s nice to not have to ever borrow at a higher rate."

2021-04-26 19:49:35,wallstreetbets,Paying off your mortgage is the quickest way to becoming wealthy quicker.  Pay it off asap.

2021-04-26 17:56:23,wallstreetbets,At least residential mortgage debt. Once the interest is over five percent it starts to look like a better plan to retire the debt.
2021-04-26 18:02:51,wallstreetbets,Paying off a 30 year loan at a very low interest rate when you could use it to make enough money to pay the debt off and have some pocket money isn't a good investment.

2021-04-26 18:30:43,wallstreetbets,"That would only impact you if you cleared 1 million that year from what I understand.  A safe dividend type stock or group of stocks like I'd suggest for capital preservation and slow growth wouldn't be something you'd liquidate to that level nor would you be making a quick million bucks on the stock.  These would be the stocks where you'd make a bit more money than you're paying in mortgage interest and would be able to use dividends to slowly siphon capital to pay your mortgage payment if you wanted to go that route. 

Say your mortgage balance was 500k, you could pay that off immediately and start putting your paychecks into the market, or you could toss the 500k into a group of stocks that pay dividends and are relatively safe.  For example sake say UTG which pays a monthly dividend that comes out to $2.16 a year. If you put the entire 500k into there you'd be able to generate almost $2,600 a month in dividend payouts that you can use to pay that mortgage and still retain 100% of your original 500k.  Over the course of a 30 year loan even if the dividend never went up (it has grown consistently on a yearly basis since it's inception in 2004) that would come out to $939k without touching your principle."
2021-04-26 18:43:47,wallstreetbets,HELOC rates are nearly double mortgage rates so that wouldn't really make any sense.  You'd be better refinancing if your current rate is anywhere near the level of HELOC rates (5.6% average vs sub 3% for refinance).
2021-04-26 18:46:45,wallstreetbets,"The amount of money is irrelevant, even if he only owed $100k chances are he could safely invest it and earn a higher return than he'll be paying in mortgage interest."

2021-04-26 18:54:32,wallstreetbets,Refi's aren't free though and if you finance closing costs it can take a few years to recoup your expenses.
2021-04-26 18:33:57,wallstreetbets,I got incredibly lucky and was refinancing at exactly the right time. Switched from a 30-year to a 15-year for only $100 more per month.

I just stopped paying after that because fuck them, then it ended up on some debt collectors desk where eventually I was able to settle the debt for half of what I owed and took a hit to my credit. I was 20 years old though, so who cares, it's all rolled off now."
2021-04-26 19:32:35,wallstreetbets,100%. Credit card debt with a crazy APR is awful. Never leave a balance on there unless you absolutely have to.
2021-04-26 18:00:24,wallstreetbets,You sound like someone who doesn’t own a paid off mortgage like I do. That’s fine. Please borrow against your home and invest it. I was so happy to buy my condo in 2009 for half off.
2021-04-26 18:31:45,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, way better to invest it, and let the house appreciate further, and then pay it off when you sell, and make far more on investments, especially right now when mortgage rates are sitting below 3%. Getting more than a 3% return is dead easy, so 100k or whatever would net you $10k in the market - $3k in interest on the house vs putting 100k into the mortgage and saving $3k in interest but having no money to invest, and no cash available for anything else."

2021-04-26 19:13:51,wallstreetbets,"Bah

Long term property prices will outpace any downside to this strategy

Cash out refi every couple years put that money into investments... When there's a downturn just skip the refis until they make sense again.

Only trap here is you can't get used to the refi money otherwise you're gonna be hurting once a downturn comes... But beyond that houses are like free money

2021-04-26 18:18:37,wallstreetbets,"You're correct, I don't have a paid off mortgage. I'm not going to borrow against my home to invest (definitely not what I said), but when I have leftover money at the end of the month once I've covered my mortgage and my bills and my discretionary spending, why on earth would I use it to pay extra on my mortgage, the real interest on which is likely negative, when I could Invest it instead?"
2021-04-26 18:42:03,wallstreetbets,"I'm not a bear, but you realize that literally this exact sentiment was prevalent before the great depression.

That's great advice until you dont make 3%, and instead 15-40% of your initial investment goes up in smoke in a correction/crash.

You're also exposed to interest rate risks. No guarantee these rates stay low the whole term of a 30 year mortgage.

I agree (and am actually doing) exactly what you suggest. But it's dangerous to suggest that it's a sure thing.

There is no surer return on investment than retiring your debt. It wont give you the best returns, but it's incredibly safe."
2021-04-26 19:23:28,wallstreetbets,It would only be taxed as income if you're buying and selling before the 1 year mark otherwise it would be taxed as capital gains or at the dividend tax rate.

2021-04-26 18:48:51,wallstreetbets,My interest rate will stay low for the term of a 30 year mortgage because I'm not completely retarded and didn't sign up for a variable interest rate.

2021-04-26 18:51:25,wallstreetbets,"except your interest rate is locked, and as long as you come out ahead in the long run over 30 years, you are still better off not paying off your mortgage early (and having no cash available to you)"

2021-04-26 19:30:17,wallstreetbets,"Residential mortgage debt in the United States is the most ridiculously subsidized financial instrument on the planet. You have a limited amount of money each month.   Whatever you don't spend is savings. We're both investing it, but I'm investing it in an IRA where it will make average gains of 4% or more annually, and you're investing it in paying off debt that costs less in real terms than holding cash. Obviously if you have a variable rate mortgage or an interest only loan or a low down payment so you have PMI and other costs on the debt, the calculations are gonna shift but over the life of a thirty year loan the difference in total value is dramatic."
2021-04-26 18:55:42,wallstreetbets,"So you literally signed a 30 year term at 3%? I have never seen a 30 year term mortgage and even if I did I'd never sign one.

2021-04-26 16:25:19,wallstreetbets,"Anything above 50k should be considered yolo imo

2021-04-26 16:48:40,wallstreetbets,Let them think that!
2021-04-26 17:29:12,wallstreetbets,"Nah big expectation about April LIDAR demo and bumped up earnings, plus rumored buyout (with lots of substantiating evidence behind it). If their LIDAR exceeds LAZR they should be worth at least the market cap of LAZR (8B as of today - $50+ per share)"
2021-04-26 16:28:03,wallstreetbets,This is the users only post...either trying to show us da way or trying to use us to make way

2021-04-26 16:11:41,wallstreetbets,"Nice bro...I dropped 15k on it @ just over $11 average buying dips since Feb...not sure I would have had the stones to do it at 1.5 so fair play, well deserved!"

2021-04-26 19:20:28,wallstreetbets,"really depends on the deal that is reached. The entire company may not be sold in one transaction - there could be a special dividend for the sale of one or more verticals while you keep the shares, there could be some kind of deal where X MVIS shares get converted into Y shares of the acquiring company, etc."
2021-04-26 18:57:56,wallstreetbets,Roughly $6.60 per billion buyout
2021-04-26 16:29:44,wallstreetbets,Tfsa baby
2021-04-26 16:49:26,wallstreetbets,"There is no buyout right now. Just rumors. Be careful.

Micro is positioned well for one, and they are looking for one. That's it."
2021-04-26 15:52:58,wallstreetbets,Soon by May this could be 100 been on since 10.93avrg up cost
2021-04-26 19:18:15,wallstreetbets,"This price runup is pure speculation. Great company and well positioned for one, but no garuntees. Proceed with this as u will"
2021-04-26 16:13:58,wallstreetbets,This could be 100+ end of the week spread the word this squeeze / coupled with a buyout GME type surge
2021-04-26 16:30:34,wallstreetbets,Tfsa
2021-04-26 16:28:27,wallstreetbets,If you invest within contribution limit why not.
2021-04-26 15:55:54,wallstreetbets,Cut that ape shit out.
2021-04-26 18:47:55,wallstreetbets,Lets not
2021-04-26 18:58:56,wallstreetbets,"Dude that‘s so missleading, there won’t be a buyout that soon"
2021-04-26 19:28:46,wallstreetbets,"it's possible, but I don't think a buyout is going to be announced this soon. The automotive LIDAR sample was supposed to be ready to demo to partners by the end of April, so that could be a catalyst for this move. Given the really high volume in the last two sessions, maybe shorts are giving up after failing to drive this below $10."
2021-04-26 19:28:19,wallstreetbets,glad to give you a helping hand!
2021-04-26 16:31:11,wallstreetbets,Congratulations man. I don’t even know you but I’m excited for you
2021-04-26 18:34:33,wallstreetbets,Very misleading message. There’s no guarantee on a full buyout
2021-04-26 15:56:29,wallstreetbets,Cheese
2021-04-26 18:45:42,wallstreetbets,"No guarantee on anything. Could be way off the Mark indeed ,"
2021-04-26 19:40:45,wallstreetbets,"It could very well be a fluke and crash 
Positive thoughts and positive action breed results

2021-04-26 16:51:55,wallstreetbets,"I was expecting the ending to be: “When are we squeezing?”.

Still a great video."

2021-04-26 17:14:57,wallstreetbets,"I agree there’s a correlation that can by analyzed with Elliot wave theory, but you should know well enough now to understand that GME is not a normal stock and doesn’t function within the bounds of widely accepted theories or analysis. 

That being said, this increase was carefully constrained by someone out there. Look at the 168.5 level and how many times it was hit and brought back down. There’s an Elliot there, and a ratio could probably be found after a few rough calculations. Also, if you watched it real-time you’d notice as SOON as it hit 168.5 it dropped IMMEDIATELY to 168.41 EVERY TIME until it finally broke through. 

So I agree you could possibly use Elliot theory to  predict the future because whoever is constraining the price to not move too high too fast is kinda forcing it that way (either because that’s the best they can use what they have or cause that’s the design they’re used to), but I wouldn’t hang too much on to it. 

Just hold and the analysis won’t matter"

2021-04-26 19:13:11,wallstreetbets,"i mean you said it yourself, this only goes as far as the longs can sustain buying, but that becomes much much harder as we trend upwards, breaking about of the 400s will be so difficult since low volume days provide good shorting opportunities( plus the systematic opening dumps we have seen these past few weeks )   
so in addition to the organic buying that pushes us higher, the longs also need to fight any shorts that are entered in these higher ranges. im not saying its not doable, just increasingly less likely. there would have to be some serious big money to really push GME to past 500, but once it breaks out into new ATH it will be game over. a gamma squeeze is also way more likely as i believe most may option chains only go up to like 430(monthlies, weeklies are lower i think) so there will be a shit ton of selling to avoid that all the way up to that price point for each week."

2021-04-26 16:13:31,wallstreetbets,"TBH, im not literate enough to explain how margin calls play together, but I'll do my best from my knowledge. 
Margin call, in this case, is applied when your broker notices a deficient value in your holdings. Meaning you bit more than what you can chew. That was at the discretion of the player. What we should be doing is analyze the greeks in the calls (more here) and puts and see where the brokers are moving their money towards to. 
Elliot waves can help confirm movement from a random and chaotic manner (in which GME is a good example because its all over the place)
Yes, we need to close well above $350 to confirm Wave 3 and if not, the recount of waves needs to be done again. Looking back in Feb, it broke through 350 several times (which is  good!) however, more recently, it did find resistance as you stated which now is the target price. We should expect movement towards $350 but there will be hiccups. It will test and fall down and then potentially break it,"
2021-04-26 19:11:34,wallstreetbets,"Those types usually also panic sell, no?"
2021-04-26 19:27:22,wallstreetbets,"What goes up must go down. GRowth can only be sustain if there are moderate retracements at hard stops. So, for those who are FOMO, there will be entry levels for them to enter when and if the price retraces."

It is your platform and you need to adjust it to your liking so that you can understand it. If it works for you in that way, i highly suggest to sticking to that path because it works for you."

2021-04-26 19:24:11,wallstreetbets,"That is partially true. There are so many things going on that its hard to put in context for everyone. Company outlook should be viewed, Feds rates, and buying power but the market cant sustain repeated growths like this. Its unsustainable. 
My theory is that GME price is controlled by faucet leveling. Let some out, close the rest and repeat. THey are sustaining this as far as possible to wreck those OTM calls and have them expire worthless. Thats a theory. I'll get to others another time. 
We need to close above $200, and then retest resistance levels again and again. In order to go up, we need to go down. Thats the fundamental theory. 
Low Volume theory. This subreddit has been flooded with bots and has been diverging a lot of investors away from GME. Low volume and seeing other investors succeed in other stocks causes FOMO. They cash GME out and invest out into others cause a slow decline in GME stock as we can see. But it doesnt explain two factors that I wont divulge in. 

Small steps inorder to reach higher. We need to take smaller steps to gain momemtum for the ""short squeeze"". You also have to look into how many hard stops we have to go through. This shit can just mooon and then collaspe. How many retail investors are ready to cash out like that in a short time period? We would be screwed if that happened. Prices needs to be sustained or else you crash the stock"

2021-04-26 15:32:38,wallstreetbets,"What? No. $13 is the strike, the ""c"" is Call (versus p for Put).

I'll write it out full, thanks for letting me know it's wonky looking."
2021-04-26 15:44:08,wallstreetbets,"1) if things go REALLY well ($40 or higher), I'm exercising the call and getting more than a 4x payout
2) if things go KINDA well, I still have 2+ weeks to sell it for profit, which right now I'm up 60% on.
3) if it goes south or if someone screws with the price, my losses are only the premium I paid (instead of taking the loss on buying 100 shares when it was $17).

Basically, I didn't have $1700 liquid to buy 100 shares last week, but it was way less than 1/2 that to gamble on 100 shares' worth of movement.

Edit: well my bad, apparently I can't math. I'm up over 100% on that call lmao. Dumbass me."
2021-04-26 16:59:21,wallstreetbets,Three weeks? I only saw it spoken of as of last week. Luckily I bought in at $10.

2021-04-26 15:49:22,wallstreetbets,Thanks for explaining that.

2021-04-26 15:16:44,wallstreetbets,"Have been invested in TSLA for years and my experience is that every earnings I am myself bullish by everything presented but the stock always tanks the next day only to rally hard a month later. I think the trend will continue. 

Position: 300 shares"
2021-04-26 14:56:37,wallstreetbets,"Will most likely beat, and then tank. That's how most stocks have been performing the last two earnings cycles unless its a MASSIVE beat and MASSIVE guidance."
2021-04-26 14:55:28,wallstreetbets,"Yes. 

It can also beat earning estimates and tank 10% anyway."
2021-04-26 14:54:31,wallstreetbets,"What's your play/timeline here? Where do you think TSLA will be 20 years from today? It's fun to make money playing short term targets but extremely risky. I'm bullish on TSLA for next 2 decades. Buy and hold.

P.s. not an analyst. Just an individual retail investor who believes in Musk."
2021-04-26 15:10:05,wallstreetbets,"Up to 1k? I'm sure everyone with options expiring soon would hope so. Even if it does, it'll prob tank within 12 hours."

2021-04-26 19:36:37,wallstreetbets,"I'm from the future.

Its going down a bit."
2021-04-26 17:16:45,wallstreetbets,"Tesla stock price hasn’t had much to do with earnings. Investors seem to have faith that what Tesla is doing is a game changer and that eventually Tesla will become immensely profitable. I hope this is true, and I do think positive earnings would send the stock higher. I just want people to be realize that Musk has really been taking moonshots with his enterprises. While I admire him greatly, I can also empathize with anyone who thinks the stock is overhyped and overvalued."

2021-04-26 16:48:00,wallstreetbets,You were right
2021-04-26 15:05:54,wallstreetbets,"if it does it will be back fast imo, hype for possible summer event; tsla executing"
2021-04-26 16:01:28,wallstreetbets,"10% isn't really tanking, since it's up nearly 400% this year.  It's simply people taking a little profit.  Tanking would be puting it back down into the low $400 range, which I don't see happening."
2021-04-26 14:56:29,wallstreetbets,"> It can also beat earning estimates and tank 10% anyway.

2021-04-26 15:22:57,wallstreetbets,"It will, the revenue is so damn good. They can make 1.2b/ year and the market cap only 2ish b which is like totally crazy"

2021-04-26 15:29:35,wallstreetbets,We’re holding on OCGN?!
2021-04-26 15:16:58,wallstreetbets,I sold all of my shares when it went up to $18
2021-04-26 14:37:35,wallstreetbets,"I honestly see this as a no brainer, and mines smooth. Tendies will come"
2021-04-26 14:38:04,wallstreetbets,Time to throw some YOLO money at this because I’m down on the month anyways
2021-04-26 14:58:19,wallstreetbets,">This is all very very very exciting news for holders of OCGN, and look at the asking price. It's fairly low for a company who may be the next Pfizer, Moderna, JJ. The stock rose 20% today but that is still a far too low price point for what I expect for this stock.

Alone, the price of a stock says absolutely nothing about the value of a company lol"
2021-04-26 15:39:41,wallstreetbets,the only way ocgn makes money is via US EUA approval. don't be confused. i have a long position for a few months now that i will sell at the right price but this is not as easy as people are making it. however! keep this squeeze going and let's get that EUA approval!!
2021-04-26 15:05:22,wallstreetbets,Ive got 988 shares
2021-04-26 14:49:59,wallstreetbets,I BOUGHT 100 SHARES LETTTTSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
2021-04-26 14:37:37,wallstreetbets,"Been there before. India won't buy from ocgn. It's only the right to sell in USA and I don't know but something like  30% for OCGN.
Pfizer distributes worldwide..."
2021-04-26 14:36:07,wallstreetbets,You had me at $30
2021-04-26 14:41:27,wallstreetbets,I'm small potatoes but I'm in nonetheless.
2021-04-26 14:42:57,wallstreetbets,I'm in with small positions and a few contracts. But my advice to anyone buying would be wait until tomorrow to see if the dip happens from the shares released.
2021-04-26 15:19:07,wallstreetbets,"You really need to edit this.  Bharat has the right to sell it in India as they developed it with public funding.

What could be bad for Ocugen is if India limits export of vaccine given the crisis there"
2021-04-26 15:41:50,wallstreetbets,"Also, they’re not only in the covid game, look at what they’re doing for blindness. I’m in long with a $6 average."
2021-04-26 14:33:32,wallstreetbets,This just convinced me to spend the rest of my buying power on ocgn godspeed
2021-04-26 15:03:30,wallstreetbets,Ok fine I’m in for 50 shares
2021-04-26 15:11:29,wallstreetbets,"Another point to add with everything surrounding OCGN is a possible squeeze play. I know that word is thrown around over and over again, but with the high level of shorting and the looming catalysts of EUA and FDA approval, it could pop.  

The downside, it could go back down to where it had been the last month (5-7) if the US requires US based trials. I believe the upside is more likely, but time will tell."
2021-04-26 15:30:42,wallstreetbets,"100% efficacy on preventing death only

But lower efficacy on other measures. Especially on the one measure that it does poorly, vs. MRNA/PFE 95% efficacy"
2021-04-26 14:32:51,wallstreetbets,Been here for a while. I would love to see some other Apes in this with me.

2021-04-26 15:24:55,wallstreetbets,"That’s what I’m fuckin talking about, OCGN to the moon 🚀🚀🚀 They are also going to issue 10 million shares at a price of $10 tomorrow. Let’s see if MVIS can catch up to these gains

https://imgur.com/gallery/cbF7nhW"
2021-04-26 15:52:35,wallstreetbets,"Same. I only had about 400 shares at around $1 average. I unloaded 200 at $15, and held $200 for fun. I’ll take that profit every day of the week!"
2021-04-26 19:01:48,wallstreetbets,"I bought at $5, sold at $13 since I knew it was a pure hype play. Put it all into $NVAX at $206 (although already had $NVAX at $40). $OCGN gets partial profits and only US - where they still have to apply for EUA and by then US might not even need Covaxin. Novavax UK EUA is imminent (early May imo) and the UK has already ordered 60m doses and Novavax aim to distribute 1-2b doses in total. Plus their unique protein based vaccine imo would be perfect to combine with their best in class flu jab for a combo flu/covid yearly booster jab. PT for me is at least $400. Optimistic is $600."
2021-04-26 15:39:12,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been in since under $1. This stock does some really weird things, be ready for a roller coaster."
2021-04-26 17:12:13,wallstreetbets,What's the right price for you?
2021-04-26 14:52:31,wallstreetbets,45%*
2021-04-26 15:18:23,wallstreetbets,"They are in talks to supply entire North America now with Covaxin which is 4 countries. USA, Canada, Mexico, & Greenland.   Me speculating but with the crisis getting worse in India and supply short my guess is they will let Ocugen distribute as much as possible even to help India."
2021-04-26 15:40:02,wallstreetbets,Totally agree. And I’ve been holding since $1. It’s the same highs and lows with this stock. I have very low expectations.

2021-04-26 14:56:10,wallstreetbets,Thank you. Been a while since my DD in January.
2021-04-26 15:40:30,wallstreetbets,They’ve “been in these same talks” for 6+ months.
2021-04-26 14:50:03,wallstreetbets,"Bharat Biotech developed and produced covaxin and made all trials. OCGN only sells it in USA. You should know it when you offer a DD. Bharat Biotech is a big player in vaccines. And I totally believe in covaxin playing a good role in the vaccination campaigns, but do your homework."
2021-04-26 15:46:50,wallstreetbets,What do you expect mindmed to open at? I have been interested in that as well.
2021-04-26 17:35:58,wallstreetbets,You got in at a good time. I guess my comment was more in line with what I’ve experienced over the last 6-8months of being in this stock.
2021-04-26 15:43:41,wallstreetbets,"The entire North America distribution was just brought up a couple weeks ago. Not just rumor and speculation by retail traders, it was actually brought up in a live meeting by a BB representative."
2021-04-26 16:24:52,wallstreetbets,"true but if India approves, OCUGEN will be big players in manufacturing this vaccine. I don't believe India one player can manufacture enough vaccines for the entire country plus the quality of approved vaccines produced in USA are much higher quality than the supply chain in India."
2021-04-26 15:53:32,wallstreetbets,"Full disclosure, I'm a smooth brain when it comes to this but I should think it will open at whatever the last  OTC price was, right now its $4.76 so I'm thinking $5 a share or thereabouts. Maybe one of the guys in the know can school me if I'm wrong in my impression."
2021-04-26 15:56:24,wallstreetbets,Yes. And it was also discussed by them in January.
2021-04-26 16:55:55,wallstreetbets,"Ocugen doesn't manufacture vaccines, they're just a handful of employees and have the rights to a percentage of sales in the US which already has a lot of vaccines.

Ocugen makes $0 on any sales in India.

I'm not sure what this post is, but it isn't a DD."
2021-04-26 19:01:38,wallstreetbets,"There is no question that Covaxin is getting FDA approval. India is our most important ally in the Quad when it comes to leveraging our reliance on Chinese trade and we just slapped them in the face by hesitating on sending raw vaccine materials. The US now has to prove to the world that India is our close ally and there is no way in hell that the FDA insults them again by rejecting Covaxin. It amazes me that the price dipped today given the statements released from POTUS, PM Modi and high ranking ambassadors regarding vaccine partnership to meet global demand, but hey, soon the whole world will know. 🚀"

2021-04-26 14:38:42,wallstreetbets,Been holding since Feb at $26 and averaged down so hopefully this will swing back.
2021-04-26 14:37:13,wallstreetbets,Arbitrage is over.
2021-04-26 13:50:28,wallstreetbets,There was definitely more asymmetry ~2 months ago when the merger ratio was being talked about here. They're pretty much moving in lockstep now so the opportunity's gone.
2021-04-26 13:38:55,wallstreetbets,The arbitrage opportunity was there before the announcement it's not anymore.
2021-04-26 14:43:36,wallstreetbets,I'm about to sell all my apha shares to throw more into mvis
2021-04-26 16:47:36,wallstreetbets,CANADIAN WEED COMPANIES DO NOT STACK UP TO US MSOs WTF are you morons thinking buying these garbage companies!!! Fuckin hilarious
2021-04-26 15:48:42,wallstreetbets,"By design, it shouldn't be advantageous to own one over the other.  Just make sure you own one of them?  Yes? Can anyone confirm this??"
2021-04-26 17:02:23,wallstreetbets,"They will likely be close. If you own APHA, and it converts to TLRY that's worth comparatively more, it's called Arbitrage."
2021-04-26 19:33:49,wallstreetbets,What will happen to my call if I have a call for Aphria for 5/21?
2021-04-26 13:38:55,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-26 14:07:55,wallstreetbets,They paying off?
2021-04-26 15:27:34,wallstreetbets,"This right here. Once they come together, Tilray will be a force to be reckoned with."
2021-04-26 16:45:59,wallstreetbets,What about curaleaf?? Bhahahaha
2021-04-26 13:44:58,wallstreetbets,Also both stocks have fallen so anyone trying to take advantage of the arbitrage lost money in the process
2021-04-26 13:44:29,wallstreetbets,What is the new merger ticker? Or is it all converting to $TLRY?
2021-04-26 14:49:13,wallstreetbets,That doesn’t sound like a thing
2021-04-26 16:00:24,wallstreetbets,I thought it was apha taking over Tilray?
2021-04-26 16:30:06,wallstreetbets,"I disagree. Whatever the price on the day the stock tickers merge, I think it's about equally likely to go up or down over the next few months after the merger.

Let's say for the sake of argument that they have no issues getting regulatory approvals and finish that process by the end of June and then set the date 7/15 as the official date: All during this period people will be looking at valuations of the company separately (now at $4.7bUS and$3.2bUS) and then together ($7.9bU.S.). If those evaluators tend to think that the combined version is going to be worth more than $7.9b, they'll drive the stock up well in advance of the actual merger date in July. At the end of trading on the 14th the stock price for the two entities separately will be based on the equilibrium of those evaluators' valuation assessment (evaluators are weighted by their investment mass of course). 

If you think the combined entity will operate more effectively after the combination because of cost saving synergies, production alignment streamlining or market power due to increased market share, you should buy now (or maybe after the Tilray vote). Don't wait until after things go through in July to buy. At this moment, it doesn't matter which stock you buy."
2021-04-26 15:08:16,wallstreetbets,it me @ $27 APHA average
2021-04-26 13:49:50,wallstreetbets,APHA will convert to TLRY
2021-04-26 16:43:44,wallstreetbets,"Aphria is taking over Tilray, but it’s wearing its skin after the merger.

Like when you kill a wild beast and you wear its hide as a cloak"
2021-04-26 16:44:16,wallstreetbets,No
2021-04-26 15:37:33,wallstreetbets,🙏😞
2021-04-26 16:16:09,wallstreetbets,"I feel ya, I bought in @33CAD"
2021-04-26 17:53:08,wallstreetbets,$TLRY @42. maybe one day we will be in the green again.
2021-04-26 13:55:59,wallstreetbets,Pinky promise?
2021-04-26 16:24:55,wallstreetbets,"What will happen to APHA calls that expire after the merger? If I'm holding APHA calls that expire in May or June and the merger happens this week, for example?"
2021-04-26 17:07:59,wallstreetbets,underrated comment x1000
2021-04-26 16:46:16,wallstreetbets,No
2021-04-26 17:09:02,wallstreetbets,It comforts me to know there are others with IQ levels lower than mine
2021-04-26 14:19:56,wallstreetbets,Yep that’s the terms of the merger
2021-04-26 16:31:55,wallstreetbets,They’re still valid they will just also pair down at the .838 ratio. Instead of holding a call for 100 shares of APHA you’ll hold a call for 83.8 shares of TLRY. This happens to calls similarly to when a stock splits or reverse splits
2021-04-26 18:57:46,wallstreetbets,"They turn into special options..I'd unload those calls before the merger if I were you, you're gonna have a hell of a time trying to sell those afterwards"
2021-04-26 16:56:54,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-04-26 19:10:33,wallstreetbets,"Luckily, and yes pure luck, I have no idea what I'm doing, I bought mvis @10 and mmed @3.5. I've by far made up my APHA losses."
2021-04-26 15:05:35,wallstreetbets,"Which still has to be approved by Tilray shareholders on the 30th, though that's probably a done deal."
2021-04-26 13:56:56,wallstreetbets,Red is the new black.

2021-04-26 13:41:40,wallstreetbets,ETrade. I'm a fan. This is the web view but the desktop app is also pretty sleek and customizable
2021-04-26 15:21:51,wallstreetbets,Ya its power etrade. It used to be optionshouse before etrade bought them out. Ive been using it a long time and its my favorite. Good compromise between being clean but still good at charting.

2021-04-26 19:45:38,wallstreetbets,I was a 16$ bag holder 🎉
2021-04-26 16:08:26,wallstreetbets,It has a great product but this company has horrible financials
2021-04-26 13:55:41,wallstreetbets,This is the way! Wendy’s is hiring
2021-04-26 14:30:27,wallstreetbets,You pay 5k a month? Wtf

2021-04-26 18:42:23,wallstreetbets,"There are lots of options ITM now, if it holds through friday close, who knows what can happen. Gamma? Selloff?"
2021-04-26 15:38:26,wallstreetbets,I forgot to cancel my $20 limit sell order from a month ago. I could’ve made $50 more!!!
2021-04-26 13:56:09,wallstreetbets,Of course! 35 eoy
2021-04-26 16:37:27,wallstreetbets,"As a rule I never hold through earnings. This rule has cost me gains on occasions, but it’s never lost me money."
2021-04-26 14:37:01,wallstreetbets,I just sold half of my position but I got in at 12... so earnings report 4/29 could keep running until then honestly...
2021-04-26 17:11:14,wallstreetbets,My guy

2021-04-26 15:31:59,wallstreetbets,Don’t get too greedy man 576% is insane lol
2021-04-26 15:34:25,wallstreetbets,Traditional wisdom says to take profits when your calls print 100% but you're in brain damage territory - personally I would hold until I couldn't stand it.
2021-04-26 15:25:01,wallstreetbets,"I'm not an advisor, but commenting so I can see the replies.
I'd say pull out when you can't handle any more green."

2021-04-26 14:40:38,wallstreetbets,End of Weiner
2021-04-26 13:20:04,wallstreetbets,Oh no
2021-04-26 13:11:51,wallstreetbets,End of week
2021-04-26 15:58:25,wallstreetbets,450$... Or more?
2021-04-26 15:45:55,wallstreetbets,"Just chill, the big news day is Thursday. Everything up until then is just noise"
2021-04-26 16:40:37,wallstreetbets,Don’t think it’s possible.
2021-04-26 18:10:11,wallstreetbets,"This is inaccurate. It opened at 10.64 on 4/21/21. It is currently at 28.80. 10.64*2.0932 = 22.27. 

This is up 270.67% in 4 days. You forgot that the gains start over every day, so 20% the first day, then that second day was a 5% increase on the new value at the COB."
2021-04-26 15:15:09,wallstreetbets,Weekly stimulus check

2021-04-26 15:45:50,wallstreetbets,Just interview at McDonalds. Drive to at least 10 different locations around you and make a quick $500.
2021-04-26 14:32:20,wallstreetbets,"That how much the boyfriend tells me rent is, why is that a lot?"
2021-04-26 19:24:59,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-04-26 14:29:23,wallstreetbets,Also have some 5/21 $17.00 ITM
2021-04-26 15:44:32,wallstreetbets,Why did you dump it?
2021-04-26 16:48:01,wallstreetbets,I like your style
2021-04-26 16:14:21,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure there was never a rumor of an acquisition happening this week. I’ve heard summer yea, but nothin about this week besides that they want to get a tech demo out before end of month."
2021-04-26 17:28:43,wallstreetbets,"Lidar sample is this week, BO is for later...

EDIT: Soon."
2021-04-26 16:49:02,wallstreetbets,I had a buddy tell me to sell at 20. I'm glad I didn't listen.
2021-04-26 19:50:02,wallstreetbets,"RIP, that's why I use a trailing stop. As the price goes up, so does my stop and I'll be taking profit regardless, currently have it at 12% to allow room for some dips, I also pulled my principal out and am riding the rest."
2021-04-26 13:56:48,wallstreetbets,Ok I pure 2k today
2021-04-26 14:24:32,wallstreetbets,Did you meant EOW? ;)
2021-04-26 17:04:39,wallstreetbets,Oh gosh! Sell tomorrow then when they open you think? Or hold through EOW?
2021-04-26 14:38:22,wallstreetbets,Ok good to know! I’ll keep an eye on it then! I got in at 13.20. Do you have OCGN?

2021-04-26 16:03:33,wallstreetbets,$42069
2021-04-26 15:35:56,wallstreetbets,"Yea. Shoot. Maybe I’ll just take my profits and just buy more shares. Based on everything I’m looking into about MVIS, plus I have some time after the earnings, these option calls may be worth a lot more if I wait but I don’t know. Lol"
2021-04-26 15:36:31,wallstreetbets,Lmao.
2021-04-26 17:38:29,wallstreetbets,I'm up 178% on May $20 calls at close today. Stop loss set at 150% gains.
2021-04-26 15:27:17,wallstreetbets,Ok. I don’t know. I want to get her pregnant so I don’t want to pull out too early. I’m just trying to get opinions so thanks for the reply.
2021-04-26 14:54:48,wallstreetbets,"Just the tip.

\*This is not a financial tip\*"
2021-04-26 16:00:20,wallstreetbets,What if the Weiner never ends?
2021-04-26 16:06:26,wallstreetbets,Any kind of green
2021-04-26 18:49:54,wallstreetbets,S’new to this and can’t find shit about news this week where can I find some threads to explain this mvis movie
2021-04-26 18:15:30,wallstreetbets,https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MVIS/performance
2021-04-26 19:49:26,wallstreetbets,That’s pretty genius. If you stay around for 60-90 days (can’t remember which) at one near me you’ll get an extra $300 I believe.
2021-04-26 15:03:40,wallstreetbets,My money is on you having unrestricted visitation this weekend my man
2021-04-26 19:25:21,wallstreetbets,"No wait I could spend it, but shouldn't have lol"
2021-04-26 15:55:20,wallstreetbets,"Not OP but I sold at 98% gains. After only holding the stock 2 trading days I figured I wasn't going take my chances of not taking profits on a quick double return. As the old saying goes, ""If it's good enough to screenshot it's good enough to sell."". My long term plays are elsewhere but if I see a healthy base forming I may go back in before earnings."
2021-04-26 16:05:58,wallstreetbets,"Buy the dip, sell the rip.  This is the Ron Popiell way."
2021-04-26 16:38:59,wallstreetbets,Because Green is always good.
2021-04-26 14:03:39,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
2021-04-26 14:29:30,wallstreetbets,Let’s fucking go 🦍💪
2021-04-26 15:11:31,wallstreetbets,Easy
2021-04-26 17:11:37,wallstreetbets,Maybe set a price tomorrow as a stop loss that you’d be happy with before earnings.
2021-04-26 19:03:32,wallstreetbets,feck off with ya gosh
2021-04-26 14:52:40,wallstreetbets,"

I have both. 20 and 20"
2021-04-26 15:42:24,wallstreetbets,"If I were in your position, I'd probably sell 1 option, use 25% to buy shares, 25% profit, 50% to cover your original costs give or take, and then let the other option run since it's house money."
2021-04-26 16:07:15,wallstreetbets,Yeah EOY should be huge for MVIS 1000% definitely looks better but anything over 100% is impressive enough
2021-04-26 17:42:30,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you really want to get her pregnant. If you pull out too late, you're fucked."
2021-04-26 16:50:46,wallstreetbets,😏
2021-04-26 18:49:31,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, my bad, I forgot to remove the initial 10.64. Lol. So 170% which is what it was when It was at 28.80. 

Basically, divide the current value by the starting value and subtract 1, then multiply by 100. So 28.8÷10.68=2.7067

2.7067 - 1= 1.7067

1.7067*100= 170.67"
2021-04-26 15:14:26,wallstreetbets,"Tendies AND cuddles?!

**Brace for Impact!!**"
2021-04-26 17:02:08,wallstreetbets,"Yep.

I was in at 12 and out at 23 after it seemingly peaked at just under 24 and had a slight retraction to 21. 

Obviously regret that now but for all I know it could've dumped back to $9 so 🤷‍♂️"
2021-04-26 17:45:28,wallstreetbets,If you're at 98% gains why not sell just over half to cover your costs and wait a little bit longer to see what happens with the rest?
2021-04-26 16:35:30,wallstreetbets,I had a sell limit of 5$ for my July 30c. Bought at 1.20. Very happy with the gains but I’d forgotten I’d place the sell limit.
2021-04-26 17:24:58,wallstreetbets,"Just curious, what are some of your long plays that have more potential than MVIS?  It’s going to be an incredible week.  Not hating as profit is profit...just interested."
2021-04-26 16:26:05,wallstreetbets,I am in until at least Friday along with some 5/21 $17.00
2021-04-26 16:33:49,wallstreetbets,What does Rip refer to in this instance?
2021-04-26 17:12:10,wallstreetbets,"It’ll probably go higher tomorrow.  No idea after that,"
2021-04-26 17:24:28,wallstreetbets,Good idea.... what to though to be safe? I don’t know!😅
2021-04-26 15:00:25,wallstreetbets,What are you planning on doing? Holding or selling soon?
2021-04-26 15:46:19,wallstreetbets,Thank you!! I’m doing this. 💯
2021-04-26 16:17:42,wallstreetbets,Now I know. So much research and time and I was stumped on what to do. Now I will carry one option through and see what happens and I got 70 shares of MVIS.
2021-04-26 18:29:43,wallstreetbets,Wanted the money available for other short term plays. I may revisit and go long but hindsight is 20/20. I don't know enough about MVIS yet and mostly went in based on Thursday's sudden volume and mention spikes.
2021-04-26 17:09:08,wallstreetbets,"For me, when a stock has a substantial increase in price, I.E. 10% + gain.  I usually set a sell price and let it go.

Set it and forget it.
-Ron Popeill"
2021-04-26 16:31:20,wallstreetbets,i was going to hold for a bit. Hoping for \~13 on OCGN and looking for at least $30 on MVIS. I got OCGN at 11 and MVIS at 20.
2021-04-26 15:50:40,wallstreetbets,Good luck! Obligatory not financial advice lol. Im in for 650 shares at around 12.xx
2021-04-26 16:32:40,wallstreetbets,🤝 let’s get rich.
2021-04-26 19:38:21,wallstreetbets,Fair enough.
2021-04-26 17:09:30,wallstreetbets,$30 will be tomorrow on MVIS tomorrow forsure... hit $29.70 today!
2021-04-26 17:32:15,wallstreetbets,I’m kinda nervous about earnings day. What do you think?
2021-04-26 18:08:49,wallstreetbets,Me also. I'm real new to this. Not at diamond carbide hands level yet.
2021-04-26 18:58:54,wallstreetbets,I think tomorrow it will go up with a volume like it was today! I’ll be watching it all day!
2021-04-26 12:28:31,wallstreetbets,"I buy based on yolos, not dd 😎."
2021-04-26 12:30:38,wallstreetbets,"I bought it when you made you first post brother.  I’m not selling yet, this thing could go vertical"
2021-04-26 12:52:47,wallstreetbets,Saphyr systems getting wider rollout in Europe. Once approvals are there for wider clinical use I think the sky is the limit. Huge potential. I’m in for almost 400 at an average of $8 (which is an average down)
2021-04-26 12:23:53,wallstreetbets,Is too late to jump in isn’t it?

2021-04-26 13:07:14,wallstreetbets,It's been getting beat up for about 3 months now. Since last week it's been treating me good. I'm all in as well. 70 Calls 🚀🚀🚀🚀👩‍🚀🌛

2021-04-26 18:28:55,wallstreetbets,Been a believer in BNGO and the Saphyr system for a while now. Will hold until hospitals start using it to cure cancer. Only then will the adventure end.
2021-04-26 13:07:30,wallstreetbets,"Could i ask what trading platform are you using? 
Sorry for the dumb question."
2021-04-26 16:11:59,wallstreetbets,FUCK YEAH 💦💦💦 BNGO BOIZ

2021-04-26 12:21:21,wallstreetbets,"And... sell, lol"
2021-04-26 13:02:45,wallstreetbets,This is certainly one of the ways
2021-04-26 12:57:26,wallstreetbets,Whats the estimated date on that?
2021-04-26 12:24:33,wallstreetbets,"I personally don’t think so.
EDIT: This is not financial advice I’m a retard"

2021-04-26 13:17:33,wallstreetbets,The picture most likely indicates Robinhood
2021-04-26 14:29:36,wallstreetbets,It's actually worked on for me so far lol
2021-04-26 14:30:01,wallstreetbets,Later
2021-04-26 17:04:17,wallstreetbets,Well I think one of the reasons the share price hasn’t taken off yet is because its not clear when the likes of FDA approval will happen (which will open the equipment up to direct clinical applications)
2021-04-26 15:03:21,wallstreetbets,Naw this was 15 a couple months ago. Will be moving close to it again

2021-04-26 17:34:25,wallstreetbets,"$25 EOY is pretty reasonable. 
Especially given backing from the NHS, even with a tory government its still a very high bar to reach"
2021-04-26 14:41:17,wallstreetbets,Sadly no funds left to YOLO into BNGO... watching it now. Wish I could!
2021-04-26 12:20:16,wallstreetbets,So a ‘fat’ loss on ‘SUMO’ ?
2021-04-26 12:19:36,wallstreetbets,Nice 27.5% loss. Come back when it's 99%.
2021-04-26 12:26:39,wallstreetbets,You're still in because you're a retarded ape!
2021-04-26 12:20:34,wallstreetbets,I was in and out of SUMO. I’d be down to go back in but would need to hear some solid DD for price improvement. Any thoughts on why it will go up ?
2021-04-26 12:46:06,wallstreetbets,"I saw that a bunch of folks affiliated with the company sold quite a lot recently during this downturn.  That can't be a good sign, can it?

2021-04-26 16:26:20,wallstreetbets,Sumo is insanely undervalued..bought 7k more today
2021-04-26 12:21:23,wallstreetbets,Just saying this cuz I appreciate this ape community. You need to switch to $MVIS asap... Let's go boys.
2021-04-26 14:27:57,wallstreetbets,"SUMO is too specialized. Amazon and DataDog are going to to eat in to their prime business. They will be purchased within three years.  I have no skin in this game, and I won't be adding any either.

As usual, I'm probably wrong."

2021-04-26 12:42:51,wallstreetbets,Amateur hour.
2021-04-26 14:47:38,wallstreetbets,Man get out of these names when they are down 10-15% stocks like these when the go up they go to the moon when down to the abyss. Get out man. Buy some stocks making new ATHs.
2021-04-26 12:25:24,wallstreetbets,I do believe that they have a solid product (I actually use it in my work on a daily basis and it saved my company's ass multiple times) and that they should be able to get a big chunk of market from DataDog ($DDOG) which has >10x the valuation.
2021-04-26 18:53:24,wallstreetbets,Bought into sumo as well
2021-04-26 12:32:14,wallstreetbets,Ain’t it too late to hop on though?
2021-04-26 12:35:21,wallstreetbets,"It will for sure be late in 5 days, but right now this stonk can get you really interesting money... I am not a financial advisor though, do not take my word for granted..."
2021-04-26 12:36:27,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah I understand that, what do you think the high could possibly be coming soon?"
2021-04-26 12:39:59,wallstreetbets,"I don't think that it will get to the maximum point soon, but its price will for sure go a lot higher."
2021-04-26 14:26:23,wallstreetbets,I know I'm hopping in.  Looks like it's going well.
2021-04-26 12:43:38,wallstreetbets,Cant hurt to buy a few 😏
2021-04-26 14:24:27,wallstreetbets,"noo, noo. Till the buyout news time goes by. Better by on the next correction. (holding for 2 monthes, averaging it on each dip)"

2021-04-26 12:55:20,wallstreetbets,GME’s movement today on such low volume!
2021-04-26 15:57:52,wallstreetbets,Gmes getting censored tho
2021-04-26 13:05:26,wallstreetbets,Might as well take gme off because it’s posts are being deleted now.
2021-04-26 15:00:23,wallstreetbets,So Reddit mods are trying to control what users see and believe that's popular. By deleting other peoples posts.

2021-04-26 18:57:12,wallstreetbets,"damn its crazy that somehow every single person that is anti GME has also simultaneous made tons of money off it and has timed the market perfectly. Its ok, you can admit you didn't actually make any money lol."
2021-04-26 15:12:09,wallstreetbets,"Ibogaine is a psychedelic molecule that is made from iboga plant in West  Africa . It has been found to totally turn off your addiction. The problem is it gives you a 2 day super trip . And it also can cause some heart issues.  Mindmed owns the right to 18mc , which was synthesize and they removed the psychedelic trip and the heart problems , they designed a new molecule.. It’s in fist stage trails , for opioid addiction.   But in laboratory rats it worked on nicotine, alcohol,  cocaine , meth and people how over eat . It truly is a amazing molecule.  It’s going stop a lot of human suffering."
2021-04-26 13:55:26,wallstreetbets,"Cue MVIS echo chamber and follower mentality lol you literally just described what happens every time a stock runs on wsb. 

The news: “MVIS is the new wsb favorite what you need to know.”"
2021-04-26 13:53:35,wallstreetbets,It’s pretty obvious nobody is investing in MVIS. I think we all know what stock to invest in if you’re trying to make money and it sure as hell isn’t MVIS
2021-04-26 14:10:01,wallstreetbets,"Then why are AMC, and GME posts getting deleted? If people want to post their favorite stock; *they should*."
2021-04-26 13:39:17,wallstreetbets,We are not a cult
2021-04-26 14:06:42,wallstreetbets,I’m guessing it was like a family who had a frat house move in next door [gone sexual]
2021-04-26 14:03:31,wallstreetbets,"For months it was just GME threads with the same exact comments week after week. There was no stock movement to even justify it. So many people came here from all the publicity, hoping to get rich quick, and spent money they shouldn't have because every single thread and comment was about GME going to the moon any day now. At least with MVIS the stock has actually been going up when people starting making threads and commenting on it."
2021-04-26 12:32:57,wallstreetbets,"Reddit has this amazing system to display posts on a subreddit. There are ""Hot"" posts, which displays the most popular posts of that moment, the ""Top"" posts, which displays the most upvoted post of the last day/week/month/year, and there are the ""new"" posts, where new posts are posted."

2021-04-26 14:09:32,wallstreetbets,Also hilarious calling people poor when you’ve probably got like $2000 in Robinhood lolol. Fucking kids man
2021-04-26 14:27:00,wallstreetbets,Because 99% of it is low effort ape bullshit.

2021-04-26 14:06:34,wallstreetbets,"Granted, there was little room for other stock. Valid point."
2021-04-26 12:52:53,wallstreetbets,"Oh yes it's true thank you for the explanation. I thought there was a new WSB page haha.
The problem with the ""new posts"" is that there are a lot 😅"
2021-04-26 16:13:42,wallstreetbets,Okay cute. Don't rag on other people for not following the same tickets as you. We're all going for the same outcome.
2021-04-26 18:31:58,wallstreetbets,"Historically - generally yes.

In the future - most probably not."

2021-04-26 15:25:58,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your information. I appreciate your input. Doing a quick dive I noticed that the company was known by another name. Do you know if it was once called Broadway Gold Mining Ltd. or is this incorrect?
2021-04-26 18:41:11,wallstreetbets,"Not being a fucking soulless sack of shit that outsources the actual sales to dubious third party vendors like amazon does, for one. Come on, man. Chewy beat amazon at selling fucking dog food, and it was an unknown company on a small market. You don't think GME can beat amazon at this shit after all the free marketing it got this year alone? Jesus. I already don't buy amazon where I live, and it's either them or a local (national) online marketplace."

2021-04-26 12:35:13,wallstreetbets,As do I. Buyout likely incoming. But you did not give yourself much of a time horizon here.

2021-04-26 17:36:37,wallstreetbets,"OP bought at 28 contracts at $360 per contract and at close they are $530.  He's up $4760 in one day on a $10k bet.  After market is blasting off too.  Might wake up to another $5k.  

At least he isn't like me selling CCs on MVIS last week.  Locked in 35% profit doesn't feel so good."
2021-04-26 15:44:00,wallstreetbets,After they took 1.5 months to pay out and them stopping trading. I tan from them
2021-04-26 15:53:19,wallstreetbets,Because of the tomfuckery with restricting the purchase of stocks.....right when they are running up. They really screwed up the GME short squeeze back in January and fucked a lot of people.
2021-04-26 17:16:54,wallstreetbets,RH leaves out so much data in their UI and gamifies the interface. You indirectly pay a lot in getting worse fills compared to using an actual broker which is like $10pm.
2021-04-26 14:57:23,wallstreetbets,was it?
2021-04-26 15:36:02,wallstreetbets,I never said today is the beginning. Hope you analyze charts better than analyzing comments
2021-04-26 14:59:49,wallstreetbets,"Foot meet mouth. Unreal PA this past week, glad I didn't sell"
2021-04-26 12:13:13,wallstreetbets,"The cost for each contract would be 0.36 * 100 = 360 since each contract covers 100 shares. At expiration date, if the stock price reaches 40, the intrinsic value would be (40-strike price) * 100. But I don’t see the strike price here so not sure how much it gonna be. The profit however, is (40-breakeven)*100 = 640 per contract"
2021-04-26 11:58:36,wallstreetbets,For sure OP wont loose money. I am sure he makes enough profit. but just trying to learn about options....so trying to understand what happens when calls expire. Will it be 10k loss?
2021-04-26 12:53:45,wallstreetbets,"I just bought the cheapest one I could get right at open (May 21 @ $35 for $1.70) and it peaked up to $3.25, back down a bit for now but still green. I mean yea if you want, il yolo your money for you no problem lool"
2021-04-26 13:11:55,wallstreetbets,Also if you're selling options your exit should be about 50%.
2021-04-26 16:32:48,wallstreetbets,"But if there were a sudden spike let’s say 2 weeks out of 4 in the contract, but it’s below the strike price still. Would you profit just based on the volatility? I’m thinking it would be more safe because you have a greater chance of getting that spike over 4 weeks as opposed to a weekly"
2021-04-26 15:44:32,wallstreetbets,We all are
2021-04-26 15:08:01,wallstreetbets,Your comment aged terribly. OP is up 30-40% already lmao
2021-04-26 14:00:32,wallstreetbets,You a bum
2021-04-26 16:11:13,wallstreetbets,OP made 4k today. Wbu?
2021-04-26 16:51:38,wallstreetbets,It does and the premium you paid to get the option. If those three things exceed the buyout price you lose. Very easy to do.
2021-04-26 14:30:57,wallstreetbets,Thank you Captain Obvious.
2021-04-26 13:41:45,wallstreetbets,Yeah im sitting on a pretty batch of 5/21 25c and the delta at .58 is making my micropenis look like less of a second belly button
2021-04-26 12:33:15,wallstreetbets,I believe so
2021-04-26 13:16:27,wallstreetbets,Cookie Monster have many cookie. But Cookies expire. So Cookie Monster eat more cookie longer he has them. No more cookies when expired.
2021-04-26 13:15:35,wallstreetbets,Options are a decaying asset. At 30 days until expiration it starts decaying much faster and you need a larger price move in the underlying stock. Theta is the amount of daily decay.
2021-04-26 16:38:15,wallstreetbets,"Question, what happens to option contracts during a buy out?"
2021-04-26 16:42:49,wallstreetbets,"Ugh. Bought at 10, sold at 17 at slightest hint of red. Am idiot, never again. Fomoed back in at 26, knowing that is a pretty bad time to buy. Wish me luck."
2021-04-26 17:49:13,wallstreetbets,I do hope so!  We will see tomorrow if this continues or IV crush occurs
2021-04-26 14:57:46,wallstreetbets,That’s what the chart shows
2021-04-26 12:00:16,wallstreetbets,"If OP doesn’t sell the option before the expiration day, then nothing left. 100% loss, would be nice loss porn"
2021-04-26 12:01:34,wallstreetbets,If he doesnt exercise the option or sell he will lose eveything. With options you want to sell before the expiration date or as soon as possible because they lose value with each day. If the price stayed the same by may 20th he'd prolly be down 60-70 percent. I might be undercutting idk. Someone can correct me if im wrong
2021-04-26 16:39:47,wallstreetbets,i would say most OTM contracts are sold before they become ITM. you can make a killing off of IV and demand. i don’t think i’ve ever sold an ITM remotely near expiry
2021-04-26 19:06:07,wallstreetbets,"Sure, 7/16 30c more than doubled today."

2021-04-26 17:22:42,wallstreetbets,"But did it feel good?  

I bought 200 @ $10.25, sold $14 calls for $300 ea.  Getting boned.

Then 100 more @ $12, waited to sell a call this time at $19 for $600.  Getting boned.

100 more @ $21 this morning and sold a $22 call for $600.  Not getting totally boned yet."
2021-04-26 12:06:11,wallstreetbets,"How much would he have to invest in order to get this call?

What will be potential profit if the price reaches $40?"
2021-04-26 17:24:30,wallstreetbets,I bought $11 calls last week 6/18 (price was $10.50) and $22 calls 1/21/22. Not sure what I'm going to do with them. Could exercise the $11's but may sell them if price keep rocketing.

2021-04-26 17:30:11,wallstreetbets,not financial advice - i wouldn’t execute unless i believe in the long term future of the company. i don’t give enough of a shit to learn about MVIS fundamentals so i’m trading contracts. though if you do your DD and like the company then it could be worth it owning 100 shares long at $11 🤷🏻‍♂️

It has ridiculous spikes out of nowhere and then always seems to withdraw back to $16.50-$17.50 before regaining. However each drawdown is a little higher than before. Last week I had 20c long positions, sold a 18c covered and placed a 17.50 put after the spike and they all ended up ahead at end of week. Big volatility"

I too have noticed the recent swing patterns. Recently bought $15c when it was I believe $13.95. Suddenly popped to $16.50ish, sold it & bought a put for $13.5. It went to $13 that same night.

This was all on a Thursday, so I got the call for like $10, think sold for $85. & bought the put for $5 & sold for I think $35.

Something like that, but it was a cool $100+ in a 3-4 hour span."

2021-04-26 19:34:30,wallstreetbets,"Actually, around $430K"
2021-04-26 13:52:07,wallstreetbets,"It all depends on how long you plan on holding it. Cemex isn't going away.  They're a top global distributor of cement and so America's infrastructure spending alone won't be as impactful on CX as it is on CLF.  CLF is a great domestic stock and so responds more favorably to domestic spending.  For day traders CX has enough volatility that getting in and out can be profitable, and for those holding long, it has enough sustained growth that I don't have to worry about it too much. However, it does have periods of sharp and quick decline followed by slow recovery. Depending on how you look at that, it could be a blessing or a curse. If your goal is to put this in your portfolio and come back in 25 years expecting a fortune, that might not be the case. Those periods of sharp decline followed by slow recovery are a blessing for those who can come up with decent capital but just need a few days to do it. The stock is very forgiving in that way. You don't need to be some dickhead with a ton of cash catching the dips. 

Overall I like CX a lot, it's one of the better performing and maintenance free stocks in my portfolio.  If you're trying to ride the infrastructure wave, it's good to have some $CLF, $CX, $CAT, and $CLMT. Calumet Specialty Products Partners is another great stock I don't hear much about around here."

2021-04-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD: GME Implied Volatility Update - Trend is Lower For transparency, here is my original post.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lu921a/dd\_pros\_are\_buying\_gme\_on\_this\_datethis\_is\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lu921a/dd_pros_are_buying_gme_on_this_datethis_is_the/)

This post is just to share what I have been tracking since I first started trading options in GME.  Every week or so I've been keeping track of option prices at different strikes.  When GME first lifted off to the Moon the market was pricing a dramatic move within 1 week.  When it was at $325 around the end of January the 1 week move was plus or minus 40%.  That means a 1 week option at a strike of $325 cost about $130.  As you can see in this chart, the options market is not pricing in a big move anytime soon.  The expected $ movement week to week has been getting smaller and smaller.  

&#x200B;

[Call Option Data.  Source: I personally gather it on those dates through Etrade.](https://preview.redd.it/vr9m0ff98jv61.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d39ec5abcaf2a85d2238fc9e517d56c899825e8)

What do we do with this information?  If you own shares or options then you can feel a little more comfortable that it's not going to drop to $50 overnight as CNBC would have you believe.  They parade idiots on their shows as Analysts (aka experts).  Keep in mind they are experts of history and have no predictive value.  Same for most people.  You could buy some insurance by buying longer dated call spreads in the $80 - $100 range as they are cheap right now.   Also, keep in mind as I stated in my previous post that the cheaper options b/c the more ability retail has to control the price through aggressive buying of shares and options.  Gamma pressure easier to manifest.  If the stock ever does drop below $100 I imagine the out of the money call options will be relatively cheap at first which could be a good buying opportunity.

Everyone is waiting to hear the transformation plan led by Ryan Cohen.  The first sign of that may be on the June earnings call.  

I won't update this every week but when I see a change in trend or a big move in IV maybe I'll post again.  Good luck!! 🚀💎 🙌

2021-04-26 15:43:51,wallstreetbets,Why not $2000 today
2021-04-26 16:53:13,wallstreetbets,"Lower IV means it's less likely to make that big a move in one day. Also, it's no guarantee. IV is lower simply because the price has been pretty flat for the last few weeks. When it's not acting volatile, people are not willing to pay as much for far OTM options. When it makes a big move again, IV will jump because the big move means it's becoming volatile again. It's not the IV number that causes it to make big moves - it's the big moves that raise the IV number."

2021-04-26 12:06:58,wallstreetbets,"Agree but to make the risk reward most favorable its best to wait for Mr. Market to take this stock down like 20-30% like it did right after earnings (I think).  The stock ripped back up.  Buy when others are fearful....its much cheaper.  This will continue to be a narrative stock for the rest of this year.  Change takes time and all Ryan C. can do is get the people in position and slowly and methodically execute.  This is not an overnight success in terms of revenue and profit for the business.

My guess is when they report earnings it will be a disappointment not b/c they don't make alot of money but b/c people want details on the transformation and if they aren't transparent about it then the pro's (who are jokes and have gotten it completely wrong up to now) will see it as a trading event to the downside.  The pro's got slapped around in the last dip."

2021-04-26 13:36:11,wallstreetbets,"I picked up OCGN at .25 on 6/1/20


Edit 

After thinking about this more. The main reason I bought it was pure speculation and the fact that the stock price dropped about 60-80% in one day. Got a warning for delisting so that right there is enough incentive to get the stock price above $1 (minimum price for regulatory listing approval) so possibly losing a few bucks on the chance it will  go from .25->1+ was a 65/35 in my book. Even if for a matter of 1 week, where the stock demand was pumped to get the price to close at 1+ for a week or more, was enough incentive for me to buy into a company that had a decent cash reserve and other orphan drug designations in its portfolio. Only risk was if it came April/May and the price was still sub $1.

2021-04-26 11:35:31,wallstreetbets,I’m VERY NEW to stocks as I started last week and bought 6 MVIS at $10. I would love to get more insight on upcoming stocks that I can invest in that are still cheap. Any suggestions?
2021-04-26 11:32:07,wallstreetbets,Too many clueless investors getting into companies like mvis without knowing anything about its fundamentals with this recent short squeeze
2021-04-26 15:26:44,wallstreetbets,When would be a good time to sell?
2021-04-26 15:31:48,wallstreetbets,When to sell though? That's the question.
2021-04-26 12:58:03,wallstreetbets,Is this what WallStreetBets is now just bragging about what mf hold? How about letting us know what to hold next?
2021-04-26 12:20:57,wallstreetbets,Bhbbbbnnuuhlkiiiiooo

2021-04-26 14:35:52,wallstreetbets,So mad I forgot I had stop sell limit on my MVIS and it kicked in the other week when it dropped and of course it starts ripping up now. Oh well it was only 100 shares so not to big of a deal.

But mate, investing and holding from $0.74 is out of the world. Those are true diamond hands! Curious to know what made you start on this one, and what made you hold."

2021-04-26 19:56:28,wallstreetbets,So... I'm on fidelity and can't buy shares under$1... What's a good way to buy shares when they're that low?
2021-04-26 11:08:58,wallstreetbets,I don’t get the MVIS hype. It’s only shorted 20%. There’s also a lot of buzz that their tech is not it’s cracked up to be at this point.
2021-04-26 11:38:14,wallstreetbets,"Just got 20k shares of APSI @ .29 cents looks GREAT ... Could double or triple QUICK 😉😁😍
Already up to .37 !!!"
2021-04-26 12:14:54,wallstreetbets,I don’t see why you should not trade out profits and put them into options to protect half of the cash and still control more shares..
2021-04-26 12:22:32,wallstreetbets,What are your new / next plays... Getting early is a boon
2021-04-26 12:44:35,wallstreetbets,"Have 1,000 shares of OCGN avg price $2.20.. have sold some shares here and there. Really think this has potential for $50-$100 a share, I'm just saying I like the stock, and if it does I'm guna pewp my pants and start finger painting"
2021-04-26 11:28:26,wallstreetbets,They were both no brainer for me
2021-04-26 18:28:26,wallstreetbets,Just start a blog with some affiliate links for your pics bro

2021-04-26 19:52:10,wallstreetbets,Apparently I need a pm too
2021-04-26 16:58:26,wallstreetbets,Hey I bought some call options for 25 dollars and Robinhood cancelled the at the end of day trading hours. I had 10 contracts for 2.08 worth 5k. What caused that?
2021-04-26 12:54:08,wallstreetbets,Sooner than .74?!?
2021-04-26 14:05:43,wallstreetbets,Omfg🤦🏾‍♀️
2021-04-26 12:37:27,wallstreetbets,Let me know when you find another one like that
2021-04-26 11:28:13,wallstreetbets,"I work until the emerging tech sector, MVIS is 3 blocks from Microsoft office and already did a ton of work with them, and they have a ton of patents for lidar. 100bil in USA military lidar contracts. Microsoft will likely acquire them and that will push it over 80 a share for 2022-2023. OCGN has groundbreaking eye repair and the covaxin vaccine was secondary for me. Got at the start of lockdown initially at 1.7 because everyone would be looking at screens, and Ocugen can cure blindness. It’s amazing tech, also the whole board of directors is star studded to be understated and half were in high profile positions at FDA so approval is easy for them, always front of the line. Lidar is a 5-10 year move for me rn, it will explode as it’s needed for all drones and AI and EV, MVIS has the patents. Also when trump came in office he pulled all of Ocugen s grant money, Biden put it all back. So that will slowly be priced in as well."
2021-04-26 12:17:22,wallstreetbets,Yeah these were companies talked about all throughout 2020 on pennystocks
2021-04-26 11:28:32,wallstreetbets,r/pennystocks has some great DD.
2021-04-26 12:18:38,wallstreetbets,Is it worth it to buy some now?
2021-04-26 11:09:11,wallstreetbets,"Meant to say added 10,000 more"
2021-04-26 12:25:32,wallstreetbets,"I will HOLD if you will... bought for $100,000"
2021-04-26 12:22:48,wallstreetbets,"NO DOUBT, I LOVE MONEY 🤘🤘🤘💥🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
2021-04-26 15:11:45,wallstreetbets,100 by end of week
2021-04-26 14:38:21,wallstreetbets,Stop trying to make MVIS into the ball of flaming retardation that is gme rn
2021-04-26 17:08:14,wallstreetbets,Im holding this until $45
2021-04-26 18:10:34,wallstreetbets,Great 3rd phase data - Gates foundation behind them and Emergency Use filing around the corner. Over 500 Million shares traded yesterday - LETS GO!!!!
2021-04-26 15:18:34,wallstreetbets,"Bought early this morning (so happy). I wonder, will holding until Thursday be optimal?"
2021-04-26 12:35:16,wallstreetbets,Because I fucked your mom
2021-04-26 15:17:49,wallstreetbets,No way to know anything like this for sure sir. There's equal parts research and good luck going on.
2021-04-26 12:36:25,wallstreetbets,Try not having funds cleared fast enough
2021-04-26 19:40:39,wallstreetbets,"Congrats, But I got a question I recently bought Mvis at a price of $28 per share bought 2, people are speculating that by the end of the week or upcoming weeks it'll be 100-700 per share...Any thoughts on this I'm hoping it skyrockets."
2021-04-26 18:26:49,wallstreetbets,Yah that’s the bullshit I’m dealing with...
2021-04-26 11:29:29,wallstreetbets,I’m gonna be selling next year or 2023
2021-04-26 15:35:49,wallstreetbets,But better

2021-04-26 17:11:32,wallstreetbets,Emergency Usage coming up!!!! This will shoot up to $45 very soon
2021-04-26 12:10:07,wallstreetbets,Board of directors has been head positions at FDA for 20 years before OCGN. They have restorative vision technology that is in phase 3 and groundbreaking. Go to their site and look how not “shady” they are you clown
2021-04-26 12:13:11,wallstreetbets,"USA company with USA grant money with billions in USA funding... vaccine is already in place in 80 countries, and outperforms all other vaccines"
2021-04-26 17:09:40,wallstreetbets,Holding this until $45!!! This will get emergency use and rocket up!!!
2021-04-26 12:42:03,wallstreetbets,Yeah no
2021-04-26 15:39:27,wallstreetbets,MVIS has never been that high you thinking of GME
2021-04-26 18:36:10,wallstreetbets,"march 20, 2020 it was at 18 cents a share"
2021-04-26 11:54:18,wallstreetbets,No she is ugly
2021-04-26 12:53:52,wallstreetbets,"Said literally every person ever. You’ll notice these type of posts happen AFTER it has a big run up. Why?

Because when these companies popped up on pennystocks sub they went up and down like crazy for months. They were on the frontpage of that sub a LOT. Plenty of people could have held since 50 cents and didn’t. Why? Because this post is entirely hindsight, he could easily have lost like the other 9/10 people. 

This isn’t a get rich quick scheme and i look forward to your loss porn following people like this who got lucky."
2021-04-26 11:32:54,wallstreetbets,Don’t be mad you didn’t get in lidar early
2021-04-26 11:39:19,wallstreetbets,Keep trading based on the FuNDaMenTaLs and see how far that gets you. Enjoy your no gains lmao
2021-04-26 15:32:42,wallstreetbets,I'm holding 220 shares and I want to pull out when the gettings good but I don't want to lose out if it rockets again.

2021-04-26 17:38:21,wallstreetbets,"Got in at 13, averaged down to 9.40, sold at 12.50 when it recently spiked last week. I really dont know about the EUA i was pretty glad to bail with a profit."
2021-04-26 16:49:12,wallstreetbets,Why did you sell? Just curious
2021-04-26 11:32:09,wallstreetbets,"Lidar is undeniably the future and required for drones, EV, AI, and military"
2021-04-26 11:59:16,wallstreetbets,So you’ve read nothing and assume this is a short squeeze play? This is a real company with a real product that’s going to be highlighted this Thursday. Not everything is a squeeze...
2021-04-26 11:31:22,wallstreetbets,It’s irrelevant how much it is shorted...
2021-04-26 11:32:52,wallstreetbets,"Those that know the value of mvis got in at $10 or lower, everyone else is late to the party and just taking advantage of the short squeeze

Either way lazr is booming as well as a result and also has weekly contracts"
2021-04-26 12:16:12,wallstreetbets,I’d rather add shares because I’m not poor
2021-04-26 12:15:52,wallstreetbets,"I have 200 options with 5$ strike... no reason to trade out profits with such good entry and My PT is 80.. why sell, I’m not a fool"
2021-04-26 11:31:34,wallstreetbets,Message me your next picks please.  I want to be secondmosthighsecondmostfly.
2021-04-26 14:58:25,wallstreetbets,Haha make your own subreddit with your picks lol
2021-04-26 12:56:42,wallstreetbets,"afterwards yeah of course im thinking ""they have been talking about self driving for years"" so yeah OK Lidar and Boom.

Still, its not a given that you can detach yourself from the day to day market, and just think your positions WAY ahead. That's great for you, i need to work on that.

Cheers

2021-04-26 19:29:24,wallstreetbets,"Honestly you ought post some DD bro.  If those were no brainers that early, you may be on to something"
2021-04-26 18:39:12,wallstreetbets,"I don’t fully understand your scenario/question. However, it sounds like your order was never fulfilled (My guess is the price rose quicker than your contracts filled). 

If your contract doesn’t fill, then it’s automatically canceled.

Edit: I just read it again and you possibly already owned the options? Your post could use some commas, but I’m also dense at times. If you owned them already, then maybe margin called? I don’t know. I feel like I’m not really helping here."
2021-04-26 19:24:42,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah I got in @0.15 but was just starting out so I was gun shy only got 50 at the time looking back I’m

2021-04-26 12:20:33,wallstreetbets,80$ by next year would be amazing. I should have bought more
2021-04-26 11:33:23,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the info!
2021-04-26 11:40:07,wallstreetbets,"Interesting then. I have 10 and 20C may contracts, was thinking of selling but maybe just exercise the shares hey?"
2021-04-26 12:19:21,wallstreetbets,Now I’m thinking I need to hold for a while
2021-04-26 12:36:42,wallstreetbets,So a large part of this is circumstance. Lucky bastard!
2021-04-26 11:46:32,wallstreetbets,"OP, any other companies worth exploring apart from these 2?"
2021-04-26 12:31:07,wallstreetbets,Do you know any cheaper stocks right now ? I don’t have much so was just curious to what you though some new up and comers are. ?
2021-04-26 14:53:10,wallstreetbets,Thanks. Great research.  What do you think of bb. I feel the same about them. Been holding for few years waiting
2021-04-26 19:05:14,wallstreetbets,I owned MVIS for years before selling when they just couldn’t ever productize anything. I was in it for microled or something. I think I paper handed when they went after lidar thinking this company is never going to make a product. Made a nice profit back then and another one from watching wsb because I knew it would become a meme fav. Paper handed my calls again and only turned a 100% return in a couple days instead of a 10 bagger if I held. I suck.
2021-04-26 12:27:50,wallstreetbets,Yeah I bought at .34 cents only bought 100 shares thou
2021-04-26 16:39:00,wallstreetbets,I think many of those companies have also not really gained in value
2021-04-26 12:20:40,wallstreetbets,Bought this morning. Definitely still time to buy in. We got some resistance at $13.  To the moon!!!
2021-04-26 12:21:21,wallstreetbets,Yes do your own DD on the tech the company is easily worth 60 a share at least
2021-04-26 12:25:40,wallstreetbets,"Only you must decide, I think it will continue to growth and it’s depends only if we all hold our position. But once again it’s only your choice."
2021-04-26 11:09:33,wallstreetbets,🤘🤘🤘
2021-04-26 14:07:36,wallstreetbets,What are your thoughts on buyout and PT?
2021-04-26 12:17:45,wallstreetbets,You forgot a 0
2021-04-26 12:27:12,wallstreetbets,100K 😳😳😳 you are 🤘🤘🤘 I wish I could have 1/10 of your $
2021-04-26 14:52:23,wallstreetbets,No prob just calm down relax and look the gain of MVIS btw +50% at this moment
2021-04-26 15:52:19,wallstreetbets,I think so
2021-04-26 12:36:20,wallstreetbets,I wish she told me sooner :(
2021-04-26 16:18:31,wallstreetbets,"I'm a lady, but ok🤷🏽‍♀️ I'll keep👀👀👀and learning 😊"
2021-04-26 19:43:37,wallstreetbets,"I will answer this based on the answer to my question of: What was the purpose of your stock purchase? (e.g. long term 5-10 years -some people consider actual stock purchases long term but I do not, short term days/weeks/months)"
2021-04-26 19:58:02,wallstreetbets,Are you memeing? I can’t tell
2021-04-26 15:42:05,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-26 16:38:53,wallstreetbets,"I've broken even with all the money I've invested so far. I gained a load on amigo loans (UK company) and a mining firm called kodal minerals, some from GME and AMC but been badly burnt on other stocks like virgin galactic and Bahamas petroleum"
2021-04-26 11:59:21,wallstreetbets,Surely if there is a real squeeze you would try to sell at the top and buy back in after the dust settles no?
2021-04-26 12:47:14,wallstreetbets,It’s over 150 PT you clown
2021-04-26 17:10:26,wallstreetbets,This is a winner - Has all the data and more so than any other vaccine out there. Going to $45 short term!!!
2021-04-26 12:19:55,wallstreetbets,"1. Only 20 million in cash on their balance sheet. 
2. Approved in 6 Countries

2021-04-26 17:27:24,wallstreetbets,Pfizer and Moderna got their emergency use on their strong US data results. FDA approval on Indian data results is not happening buddy . This is not bollywood movie. Please get back to planet earth.
2021-04-26 12:44:27,wallstreetbets,pretty please.
2021-04-26 16:46:04,wallstreetbets,"It did, 21 years ago"
2021-04-26 17:06:22,wallstreetbets,Apes don't think.
2021-04-26 18:45:56,wallstreetbets,"ah, I was going to say...but I didn’t, way before Reddit, so I redact my feigned incredulous remark. I say: Good for you!"

2021-04-26 14:30:16,wallstreetbets,"Op aggressively responds to anyone saying he got lucky and he can’t accept it lol. Guy’s post history goes from fashion for a year, then switches to this with no post history in any stock market sub for a grand total of 300 karma. When asked about other positions, he basically says “just trust me bro, im not a noob” without ever being accused of being a noob xD. If you need more proof of how silly this goober is, his ocgn pt is $150 a share.

 The depth of this guy’s dd is “ocgn is curing blindness and during covid everyone is staring at screens.” 5 dimensional underwater backgammon world champion IQ on this legend.

I suppose only time will tell if he’s smoking crack or really is a prophet."
2021-04-26 13:11:51,wallstreetbets,"Calm down bro I was just asking. I’m not saying I’m trying to get rich quick or anything, I just can’t invest a lot and would like to have fun with feeling the market out."
2021-04-26 11:40:38,wallstreetbets,What? I've been in mvis since it was $5 lol
2021-04-26 11:41:08,wallstreetbets,Fundamentals already paid off with mvis and lazr so I don't see your point
2021-04-26 11:35:08,wallstreetbets,I’m holding for 5 years idc what ever squeeze is going on now
2021-04-26 12:00:08,wallstreetbets,Squeeze is not the objective of this run up. You guys need to realize there is more to life than short squeezes
2021-04-26 12:42:43,wallstreetbets,Would you advise to buy mvis stocks at the current price??
2021-04-26 14:22:14,wallstreetbets,Ha!  One persons rich is another one’s poor.  Value is value.  Money is money.  % does not know the diff
2021-04-26 12:16:59,wallstreetbets,Trade them out for $17.  Again same number of shares and if all of the profits are rolled then again you control so many more shares than with a call price that low
2021-04-26 13:32:01,wallstreetbets,Lidar? Boom? Are these stocks? Please explain ?
2021-04-26 11:45:10,wallstreetbets,"Beat me to it, lol. I second the message of next picks please!"

2021-04-26 13:01:10,wallstreetbets,PM me
2021-04-26 18:55:29,wallstreetbets,Seconded
2021-04-26 11:48:32,wallstreetbets,None that I’ll share 😂😂
2021-04-26 12:33:22,wallstreetbets,Look at CYDY
2021-04-26 17:10:50,wallstreetbets,"Don't think about just price, think of it in percentages.

If a stock rises 50%, it doesn't matter if it was 300 or .50 a share, your return is 50%"
2021-04-26 12:56:28,wallstreetbets,I had 500 of OCGN at .31 and sold at $2. Kind of regretting that now lol
2021-04-26 16:42:32,wallstreetbets,"honestly looking back at the stocks I day traded last year and it's painful to look at. BNGO, MARA, RIOT, OCGN, MVIS, DLPN, REKR, SUNW, GEVO, NIO - I'm sure there is a lot more too. Sure, there is some stinkers too, but fuck lol"
2021-04-26 12:33:36,wallstreetbets,I'm waiting for it to dump again
2021-04-26 15:09:55,wallstreetbets,"Because MVIS is a good stock, GME is a meme cult. One is going up for good fundamental reasons, one is a cesspool of bagholders and dogcoiners."
2021-04-26 16:40:17,wallstreetbets,So she actually told you
2021-04-26 19:33:48,wallstreetbets,"I randomly found a thread of people talking about MVIS when it was about 11, it seemed like both a good long play and possibly might get bought by Microsoft. It felt like a good short term and long term, which I like, because if it does pop, I sell a bit as it goes up to cover my initial position, but I still feel good about the company if it goes on to drop some, or never pop at all, but steadily grows. 

So for me, the work with LIDAR and everyone saying they had really good tech, and the work with Microsoft with the Lens thing, and Microsoft having a 22bil deal with the military with that Lens thing. Felt like a gamble still, but a relatively safe one for longterm holding if the gamble didn't work out.

But it just takes practice (and luck.) But something that doesn't take either of those things is just regularly dumping money into $VTI. It's not as fun as picking stocks, but as an individual you are almost 100% guaranteed to do worse picking your own things, than you would if you just threw your money into SPY or VTI or whatever.

I do about 80% boring VTI+VXUS+BND (https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) and 20% risky/fun stuff."
2021-04-26 19:48:06,wallstreetbets,"You're right, I usually drop low on stocks, but I don't want to miss out on an opportunity like I did with Gamestop stocks, so we shall see if if it don't I'm planning to hold it for the long term. I guess in order to win there are risks to take..."
2021-04-26 11:59:59,wallstreetbets,No I wouldn’t I don’t care. I’m an investor not an swing trader. Don’t plan on selling for 3-5 years
2021-04-26 16:20:03,wallstreetbets," not every stock has some mystical squeeze man, MVIS isn’t going to be dependent on that."
2021-04-26 13:03:29,wallstreetbets,"this thread is hostile as fuck, but you wanna give some pointers on why thats your pt?"
2021-04-26 12:22:02,wallstreetbets,Those are all false lol read the S1 and the latest 10K on SEC site fool
2021-04-26 18:02:18,wallstreetbets,Shows how much you know about India and vaccines buddy. 70% of the worlds vaccines come from India. Do some research and stop talking out of your ass
2021-04-26 12:45:28,wallstreetbets,Nah
2021-04-26 11:58:18,wallstreetbets,I’m good her pusy trash
2021-04-26 14:36:17,wallstreetbets,"Oh absolutely. 

The most common thing i see across every single big win, even the guy who turned 150k into 3 million, is when they are asked about their current plays, its usually garbage 😂. That big win is too much undeserved confidence that ends up being a string of bad plays thereafter."
2021-04-26 19:27:05,wallstreetbets,"This thread is hilarious, Twitter/tik tok investors talking shit, never seen a correction, their attitudes are literally the opposite of DFV, some of them should take a lesson, guy is a hero because of the way he handles the wins... humble 💎"
2021-04-26 12:10:55,wallstreetbets,Exactly it doesn’t even matter
2021-04-26 12:43:04,wallstreetbets,I’m not a financial advisor
2021-04-26 12:17:41,wallstreetbets,Nah I’m good I’d rather relax and just sell a portion in 2023 thanks though idiot

2021-04-26 13:15:32,wallstreetbets,"Good on you.

Any crazy ideas after buyout if it happens? =)"
2021-04-26 15:50:43,wallstreetbets,Hey I sent you a pm congrats on the great plays here!
2021-04-26 13:26:42,wallstreetbets,Please me too sir🧐
2021-04-26 15:51:13,wallstreetbets,How many folks can be added to this distribution list? Space for one more?
2021-04-26 13:15:51,wallstreetbets,Me too please

2021-04-26 15:09:51,wallstreetbets,Me too🥺
2021-04-26 16:39:13,wallstreetbets,Me too
2021-04-26 13:38:13,wallstreetbets,"Why? Is there a reason for people to try to hide what they invest in? 
Genuine question, I ain’t bothered about you sharing your investments"
2021-04-26 15:22:09,wallstreetbets,First result is a class action law suit filed against them for securities fraud 😂
2021-04-26 12:58:22,wallstreetbets,You got a good return thou
2021-04-26 12:44:53,wallstreetbets,At this point I would be happy with entrance points of $21 or lower. I doubt we will see it drop too far below that.
2021-04-26 15:58:09,wallstreetbets,"It will slide again before Thursday, but it will be going to the moon. 

Going to pick up more when it dips again."
2021-04-26 16:25:00,wallstreetbets,"I got in at 10.22. Wasn’t expecting it to bounce like this though. Honestly was a long term hold for me. They aren’t even profitable right now. I just had them as a speculation hoping for an acquisition. Figured maybe they would get up to $20 a share and I’d sell. Spiked so fast I never even had a chance to look at why. Just saw today that WSB was main catalyst. Was hoping it was news of a buyout. Personally I have no interest in adding more at this price point. Sold half my shares at $24 so what I have left is free money. I’ll hold and hope for the moon. I have been moving my stop loss up though. I set it at $1.5 below value. I’m afraid that when it starts to tank, it will fall pretty quickly. It’s a 4 rating on tip ranks with 1 hold. No buys. No sells. Stock news gives it an F ranking and reports that their revenue is down 1065% since December 3rd 2020. It has just eclipsed its 52 week high though and money is money. Doesn’t matter what the catalyst is. In this case it seems mostly due to WSB but that’s not a bad thing. Fundamentals don’t matter if the price keeps going up. WSB is its own catalyst. Look what happened with GME. Terrible fundamentals yet it went up over 1000% and is still trading $100 higher than it was before WSB got hold of it. I owe a big thanks to this community."
2021-04-26 17:59:13,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-04-26 12:59:46,wallstreetbets,I took 3 dumps waiting for it to fall again
2021-04-26 19:59:37,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, to everything you just said. If you are ok with losing a pre-determined amount (and I do mean all of it) you could buy buy option contracts and make a huge profit but if you believe in the company and the fundamentals, as well as the corporate strategy, think about holding long term...

Edit

Either way, you never actually make a profit or loss, until you sell or the option gets called..."
2021-04-26 12:05:57,wallstreetbets,"So your identity as ""not a swing trader"" is more important than securing abnormal gains? You can still be ""an investor"" while taking advantage a unique situation."

2021-04-26 16:43:00,wallstreetbets,"Of course. However when MVIS started showing up on WSB last week it was under the guise of a short squeeze. And after having back to back 30% then 50% days, it's certainly playing like one. There is a strong chance it hits some ATH ($30?, $50? who knows) and settles back to FMV. My only point was it seemed like a waste to watch it bubble and not create arbitrage."

Their best ever numbers and yet still tumbled hard.  Enjoy the ride!  You’ve done great so far but the entry is just way too low for someone buying today.  And my rule is that if wouldn’t buy again at today’s price it is time to trade up.  Cash on the sideline locks in future awesome entry points for the next round

2021-04-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I analyzed 66,000+ buy and sell recommendations made by financial analysts over the last 10 years. Here are the results. **Preamble:** I suppose all of us have come across an analyst report while doing DD on a stock. Most of the reports that are freely available to the average investor are either dated or limited in access (we only have the buy/sell ratings and not the deep dive on the stock). According to [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/put-price-investment-research-2/) Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs charges $30K for access to its basic research, JP Morgan $10K per report, and Barclays charging up to $455K for its equity research package.

What I wanted to know was if you actually pay for the reports and then follow their recommendations, would you be able to beat the market in the long run? Surprisingly, there were no trackers following the performance of analyst picks over the long term and I decided to build one.

**Where is the data from:** Yahoo Finance. I used yfinance API to pull all the analyst recommendations made from 2011 for S&P500 companies. While this is in no way a complete list of recommendations, I felt that the data I had was deep enough for the analysis. Both Bloomberg and Quandl provide richer data but costs more than $20K for their subscription and also won’t allow you to share the recommendations with the public. (I have shared all the recommendations and my analysis in an Excel Sheet at the end)

**Analysis:** There were a total of 66,516 recommendations made by analysts over the last 10 years for S&P500 companies.

https://preview.redd.it/thiw0k9v6jv61.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=79936feeeeca457ede4d38f1ad7e1765dd402d68

For the three sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods.

a. One week after recommendation

b. One month after recommendation

c. One quarter after recommendation

I benchmarked the change against S&P500 and also checked what percentage of recommendations increased in value compared to the benchmark. I limited my time horizon to one quarter since analysts usually create reports every quarter and I did not want to overlap different recommendations. Finally, I also checked which banks made the best recommendations over the last decade.

**Results:**

https://preview.redd.it/8fuxjisp6jv61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=80a346af5eb6a8b3733c7ab13390dab1de5b4562

Out of the 35K buy recommendations made by the analysts, the average increase in stock price across the time periods was better than the SPY benchmark with one week returns bettering SPY by more than 40%. Adding to this, I also benchmarked the percentage of times analysts made the call and the stock price went up vs the SP500 index. 

https://preview.redd.it/hsml4g6f6jv61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=80758b9786b9962e308d20ba28495e9e139ae859

Sell recommendations given by analysts definitely have a short-term impact on the stock price. As we can see from the chart, the one-week performance of stocks that were recommended as a sell was lower than that of the benchmark. But this trend does not hold over the long term with stocks having sell recommendations significantly outperforming the market over the time period of more than one month. Another thing to note here is that on average even after the sell recommendation, the stock price did not fall. (ie, the returns were not negative)

**Which investment banks made the best recommendations?:**

https://preview.redd.it/vflyq18t6jv61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a35ad742267d57e9e2b33281d2bef8ea83dfb38

I analyzed the returns of the recommendations made by different banks. The most number of recommendations were made by Morgan Stanley who made more than 2300 recommendations in the last 10 years. From the above chart, you can see that overall, the best returns were made by Barclays with their recommendations beating SP500 by more than 125% in one-week gains and more than 30% in quarterly gains.

**How much money should you be managing to profitably buy analyst reports?**

I did a rough calculation on the amount of assets you need to be managing to make sense for actually paying for the reports. From the above analysis, we could see that the analyst reports beat the market by 23%, and on average full access to analyst reports of a bank will set you back by $500K per year. Putting in the above numbers, you need to have a whopping $19MM of assets under management just to break even. Going on a conservative side, to comfortably make profits and not to have the analyst report fee considerably impact your returns, you should be managing at least $100MM.

**Limitations of analysis:**

The above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, this is not the full list of recommendations made by these companies and are just the ones that were updated on Yahoo Finance. I also could not get any information on price targets made by the analysts to supplement my analysis. Finally, even though this analysis covers the last 10 years, it had been predominantly a bull run and this can bias the results in favor of the banks. This aspect could also be seen by observing how poorly the sell recommendations made by the banks fared.

**Conclusion:**

I started the analysis skeptical of the returns generated by recommendations made by analysts. There have been a lot of rumors and speculations about whether analysts have access to information the public doesn’t. Whatever the case may be, the above analysis shows that if you have access to the analyst reports, you definitely can beat the market over the long run. Whether it's financially viable or not to access the reports depends on the amount of assets you have under management, in this case at least $100MM!

 *Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and in no way related to any investment banks showcased above.*"
2021-04-26 12:54:37,wallstreetbets,"I did my undergrad dissertation on a similar question, but instead looking to see how much sell-side analysts on the LSE influence stock price changes. The TL;DR was that the market only cares if it is a sell recommendation, but I found that over the past 10 years they are having less and less influence."
2021-04-26 13:01:59,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, very interesting.

I think it is noteworthy that you actually disproved your own hypothesis - you said you were skeptical of their claims, but now actually you are not? That's the opposite of confirmation bias."
2021-04-26 14:04:26,wallstreetbets,"I have a methodology question. If you have already answered this, I missed it. But it relates to a problem I always have with reports that analyze the results of analysts' recommendations:

When did you assume that the stock was purchased?  Most (all?) analyses that I see assume that the stock was purchased at the last price immediately prior to the recommendation being released. But most such reports cause the stock to move up or down immediately upon their release. 

So the only way that I could achieve those returns would be to be able to front run the analyst. That would be illegal of course. I'm not saying that it isn't done, however."

They have pretty reasonably priced plans too."
2021-04-26 14:28:35,wallstreetbets,"You’re analyzing data SPECIFICALLY over the course of the longest bull run and market growth in history. Overall, if you invested in ANYTHING and that company did not go under then you definitely made a lot of money. I don’t see how this analysis can give any credit to analysts moreso than it could a consistent investor in the market"
2021-04-26 14:10:31,wallstreetbets,Why do you go max one quarter into the future if price targets are set for one year out? I think your data is wrong. I read similar studies that claim the opposite and trust them more than some random on wsb. Great effort though. I recommend reading a random walk down wallstreet.

2021-04-26 14:41:00,wallstreetbets,"@nobjos, please answer this :).

Are you comparing the market price of the stocks post-recommendation or before its published? If after, are you including after-hour prices?

If it's after, it seems totally reasonable to make an auto-trader based on recommendations and win out."
2021-04-26 14:48:08,wallstreetbets,">So the only way that I could achieve those returns would be to be able to front run the analyst.

The analysis includes price performance over 1 week, 1 month and 1 quarter. The idea is that these timeframes will even out any short term volatility due to the announcement"
2021-04-26 16:57:23,wallstreetbets,Yep. I think it should be a week or even day after recommendation.

2021-04-26 15:32:31,wallstreetbets,+1 for yearly!
2021-04-26 14:38:39,wallstreetbets,"He benchmarked against the sp500, and that seems totally fair."
2021-04-26 14:43:17,wallstreetbets,"There's two ways to look at this:

* one, is the analyst recommendation accurate (like if they say the price will be X within Y time)
* two, does the analyst report being published have a positive impact on the stock price, as compared to the market

I feel like he answered (2) and that's pretty good to at least act on and make stock picks"
2021-04-26 12:25:16,wallstreetbets,"Please don't ping the mods unless we've specifically asked you to.   Some of the big kids are under a tsunami of notifications.

For the record, you can always ping me this time of day and I'll be happy to review a visualmod/automod removal."
2021-04-26 16:34:51,wallstreetbets,"Yes. So, my motivation was the impacts MiFID II - which is bad for sell-side research - and reducing information costs are having on how much the market gives a sh*t about analysts' recommendations. Since most of this material lessening has happened since 2018, I attributed it most to MiFID II. Got a good mark, so must have been somewhat good research lol"
2021-04-26 16:29:30,wallstreetbets,Thank you for this. This is what I come to this sub for.
2021-04-26 19:44:35,wallstreetbets,Math never lies!
2021-04-26 15:04:30,wallstreetbets,"If I understand you correctly, you're saying ""It doesn't matter."" 

But I believe that it truly DOES matter, because it determines what the denominator is when you calculate the return."
2021-04-26 13:52:36,wallstreetbets,I'm clapping right now I'm clapping so hard this is the such a moment
2021-04-26 14:45:55,wallstreetbets,"Yeah and fairly enough he states that the bull run can be a contributing factor as well as the poor long term sell recommendations so that’s fair. I mean to take no credit away from the analysis. Helluva a lot of hard work put into it, I am just skeptical of people who are paid to sell me stocks"
2021-04-26 12:36:17,wallstreetbets,Thank you so much! Ohh Ok. I didn't know about this!
2021-04-26 15:30:54,wallstreetbets,So basically you should not take the stock price when the analyst rating was releases but some time (2 weeks?) before that?
2021-04-26 12:42:06,wallstreetbets,"Thank you - this sub is what it is because of folks like you making great OC and posts.

2021-04-26 13:07:32,wallstreetbets,I am typically available as well.
2021-04-26 16:11:06,wallstreetbets,It should be the price at market open after the rating is released rather than previous day ending price.

2021-04-26 16:58:15,wallstreetbets,"Very real possibility of a buyout, also MVIS holds patents on some game changing tech revolving around self driving and augmented reality. There’s a lot of upside you won’t find in the fundamentals, but I understand if trading on fundamentals is your thing."
2021-04-26 12:15:10,wallstreetbets,Buy the rumor sell the news. It’s a feature the algorithms like to keep. Do that then buy back in immediately during the sell off. As I said in my post you replied to it’s a plan for the short term
2021-04-26 12:06:05,wallstreetbets,Hahahahaha hahaha RIP
2021-04-26 11:54:50,wallstreetbets,I thought reading short squeeze in the meme video but I just misread 😔
2021-04-26 17:14:25,wallstreetbets,What makes MVIS so great is that it is both a legit play and a short squeeze play. If the buyout happens before shorts cover...shit is gonna be absolutely insane.

2021-04-26 18:32:22,wallstreetbets,"No, I simply became less retarded from the book and in its absence reverted back to original retardedness. 

Retardeder means more retarded than before and while possible was never established by a licensed practitioner. 

Now I did buy hyliion for an average of $30 and sold for $18. Took that money and put it into tqqq at an average of $85 and sold it for $105. Then took that and went back to Hyliion and bought in at $9. 

This could very well be evidence of retardeder."

2021-04-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$XM Qualtrics - Your Favourite Company’s Favourite Company So much of what gets posted here is some stock with incredible growth potential and very little REAL value, like a bet at the roulette table on 35 black.

Qualtrics is definitely NOT that type of company. So what do they do? They operate in a new SaaS (software as a service) company that uses AI and deep learning to bridge the experiences between business, employees, consumers and products. It’s a cloud platform that helps businesses grow, engage employees in a positive work culture, customers spend more and companies develop better products. Right? BORING.

Here’s what you actually need to know: they IPOd this year and are severely undervalued. Over 13,500 companies and organizations use XM, including about 80 of the Fortune 100 companies. Q1 subscription revenue is up to $186, up 46% YoY. And forward guidance is super juicy. Remaining performance obligations total $1.1B, which is up 77% YoY. If you don’t already know, performance obligations are contractual agreements to delivery services for revenue, a peek into future earnings.

The stock popped about 22% on the Thursday after an earnings report. What was really interesting was that the earnings report didn’t contain any real information. Their IPO filing already had disclosed through its performance obligations what the revenues were going to look like. What had happened was that the market had finally admitted/realized some of the latent future cash flows.

And BTW don’t confuse this ticker with Sirius XM Holdings LOLLLL

**Fair/intrinsic value: \~$150**

Current value: $42.00

Disclaimer: I’m not an advisor and this is not financial advice. I do have a long position in the company.

EDIT: This is an edited repost from an accidentally deleted post the other day."

2021-04-26 11:37:04,wallstreetbets,"I manage ongoing data collection for a social science lab at Stanford. Stanford has an enterprise license with them, so any of our .edu accounts can use their template and have some pre-approval for usage (think IRB). Then, per lab / per study, we take out contracts with Qualtrics for additional cost. The back and forth with their actual humans is obnoxious. 

+ Trade secret I've noticed by digging through the data I've collected., Which includes all activity partaken on participants' smartphones. Qualtrics, and others like them apparently, are tapping into what is a effectively a class of professional survey takers, a funky sector of the gig economy. Not clear as of yet how much bias that adds to any data gathering, but it's a plain fact that's totally unacknowledged. I've brought it up with my rep and gotten just shrug emoji as an answer.

So, enterprise licensing makes for stickiness. Actual interaction makes for crummy service. Recruitment product is weaker that is commonly known."

Also, they don’t have to have another scalable product. They have one already. They just need deeper market penetration and a higher spend from existing customers, which many of their clients are already happy to do."
2021-04-26 12:48:32,wallstreetbets,"I’m currently working for a startup thats trying to build an app and qualtrics is a big part of its functionality. From speaking with their engineers and sales reps about anonymity and data security they said that there is no form of tracking or collection of data on their end through their survey/xm tools. They sell the qualtrics subscription or license (license for my company’s purposes) and then that’s all they can see. They can’t tell how many times you’ve used it, the questions or features your using, and definitely not the results of any work. Not sure how standard this is but I pretty sure their security is done by a third party and other checks are put into place to ensure the confidentiality/security of your data. My companies main customer is the DoD so this is a feature they really like, but this isn’t where qualtrics is innovative. They’re rapidly expanding their XM software capabilities (employee, product, brand etc) and are HUGE into their own user experience. Qualtrics regularly asks for feedback while using it and the company spends a lot of time, money, and resources into expanding/helping out other companies who want to expand on their softwares current capabilities,(like my company is doing). This feedback and collaboration with others gives them a clear enough direction on where to take and keep transforming their software. Not sure if this is part of my NDA but fuck it I also know that there’s 2 more phases of their current XM software to come out in the next year which add more capabilities and customization for the user. So what myself and people are using now isn’t even the final envisioned product and it’s still (imo) some of the best software for the price. I use the XM, dashboard, employeeXM, and survey stuff everyday even weekends. TLDR; innovation will come from the feedback and partnerships theyre investing so heavily into, not data. Also their current software hasn’t even reached its final form so Long-term🚀🚀🚀"

2021-04-26 11:04:54,wallstreetbets,"I made $2,100 on Friday. Then jumped in Riot and made another $2,100. I'm back on MVIS."

2021-04-26 12:42:59,wallstreetbets,Damn MVIS is flying today!
2021-04-26 12:51:44,wallstreetbets,My only regret is not investing more when I made my first buy
2021-04-26 13:01:04,wallstreetbets,"What's making it soar?


I bought in at 15 and sold at 14 then it went to 10 so I thought it was a done deal."
2021-04-26 13:19:31,wallstreetbets,Up 45.92% since last Monday y'all. To da 🚀🚀🚀🌝
2021-04-26 13:33:48,wallstreetbets,"I now love this stock, been in since $1. This is the double headed dildo we’ve all been waiting for."

2021-04-26 14:41:27,wallstreetbets,"Bought a call and made 300 percent and closed wayyy too early but sold a covered call  for a  $600 premium with a $28.10 strike price (May 17), unfortunately i think you retards are gonna blow past that and i'm gonna have to sell my shares albeit for a hefty profit."
2021-04-26 15:00:01,wallstreetbets,"Look at Mindmed index comparison, hit that stock too."
2021-04-26 15:02:50,wallstreetbets,Word is it's definitely not too late to buy in

2021-04-26 15:15:39,wallstreetbets,"I could only afford 7 shares at 14$, so I'm not as cool as you guys. But man it feels good to see the numbers going up."
2021-04-26 15:16:15,wallstreetbets,Just in @$25c hope it’s not too late

2021-04-26 15:29:01,wallstreetbets,I made £7000 profit in a week. Got in at $12 (was going to go in at $10 then chickened out). I invested £5000. This is crazy money for me. I’m waiting on $30 before I think of what to do next
2021-04-26 15:30:26,wallstreetbets,"I'm glad I saw this at market open! $300 is a lot of tendies for this sub but, I'll take it."
2021-04-26 15:30:29,wallstreetbets,"My 20 shares were bought at $15, up 70% so far!!"
2021-04-26 15:34:53,wallstreetbets,I’m pretty excited by their upcoming new product the mplea (micro penile laser enhanced artifact) consumer product ; this will blow up the penile industry . Tits to the jack.
2021-04-26 15:35:34,wallstreetbets,Just reloaded with 5k! 😍🍽
2021-04-26 15:38:31,wallstreetbets,Dude nano is heavily shorted we need to attack that bitch ASAP too!
2021-04-26 15:41:49,wallstreetbets,Do you guys plan on keeping long term or if not what price is the goal?
2021-04-26 15:46:13,wallstreetbets,You are my Hero and we are not worthy of basking in such testicular fortitude.
2021-04-26 16:10:29,wallstreetbets,What is the price goal here bois?
2021-04-26 16:25:24,wallstreetbets,Im gme gang and now mvis gang but not sure where we going with the price??

2021-04-26 16:30:36,wallstreetbets,Insaneee
2021-04-26 16:31:22,wallstreetbets,Do you guys think it’s too late to get involved? Been holding off for a couple of weeks and kicking myself now!
2021-04-26 16:31:55,wallstreetbets,🔥🔥🔥🔥
2021-04-26 16:37:58,wallstreetbets,When are you guys expecting MVIS to cap or start going back down? Was today the glory day and it's all downhill from here?
2021-04-26 16:55:02,wallstreetbets,"I’m playing this one safe and day trading it, buy 4,000 shares at support, sell at resistance, over and over again, over 3,000$ in gains just today alone with zero risk"
2021-04-26 17:10:59,wallstreetbets,You forgot to post AMC gains
2021-04-26 17:47:47,wallstreetbets,I'm 7 shares in - shoot for the mooooon
2021-04-26 18:10:05,wallstreetbets,"I missed out on MVIS and MMEDF!  I had limit orders set on both of them but didn’t wake up in time to see that my orders didn’t fill (damn west coast time!).  By the time I checked both were up 30% on the day!

I’m a retard.  I woulda made a few thousand with the two orders I had set if I had just gone market instead of limit.  Dumb rookie.  I can’t even call myself an ape."
2021-04-26 11:40:14,wallstreetbets,"Get ready for the LOSS, This is an options dream stock because it has huge gains followed by long falls. I have seen so many YOLO’s today with people paying $22-$23 dollars a share for this stock. This will take all the daily movement out of this stock. You have to learn to make money on movement and not buy shares and hold them. That’s for people that can’t invest."
2021-04-26 12:06:01,wallstreetbets,GUH i sold for a gain at $17 last week lmao
2021-04-26 15:09:01,wallstreetbets,I bought puts at $13 so you’re welcome everyone
2021-04-26 13:27:00,wallstreetbets,Yea i had like 150 shares at $1.30 and sold at $4 lol fuck my life
2021-04-26 13:10:03,wallstreetbets,How did you find DD about $MVIS so early? I caught it at $14 which is still early enough for 100%+ but I would have loved to have caught it at $4!
2021-04-26 15:11:56,wallstreetbets,"That's incredibly lucky, don't worry about what you couldn't afford in the past and enjoy what you can afford now - all is good!"
2021-04-26 11:54:35,wallstreetbets,Dayummm your killing it!
2021-04-26 18:38:29,wallstreetbets,Makes me feel proud of you for some reason lol I invested at 13 for out at 20 you must be doing pretty good right now
2021-04-26 19:10:23,wallstreetbets,Maybe time to get one more share lol
2021-04-26 10:53:04,wallstreetbets,I'm no expert but I use TD and my shit goes though almost immediately.
2021-04-26 10:33:39,wallstreetbets,That's absurd. There's no excuse why it should take that long.
2021-04-26 10:41:56,wallstreetbets,"You can still buy and it will debit your account

When the deposit hits it will counter the debit and balance out"
2021-04-26 10:39:29,wallstreetbets,Ouch!
2021-04-26 12:18:33,wallstreetbets,Vanguard has repeatedly fucked me like that and today they hung up on me after I was on hold for like 15 minutes.
2021-04-26 12:55:23,wallstreetbets,Man I missed out on $11 calls because my funds didn’t settle on ameritrade
2021-04-26 13:50:08,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the stock market where you will feel like youre issing out on 12k whether you made or lost money all the time
2021-04-26 13:50:32,wallstreetbets,"Fuck Webull too, chinese owned motherfucker!"
2021-04-26 11:58:37,wallstreetbets,yeah no its definitely not your fault for not being prepared def your broker
2021-04-26 13:17:16,wallstreetbets,Every bit counts. Congrats on your gains :)
2021-04-26 16:32:37,wallstreetbets,I hear ya man. I’ve been doing pretty badly lately so I’m pretty thrilled with what I made on MVIS. I only bought 12 shares at 10.22 but it’s great seeing some 100+% gains in my portfolio for a change. Lol. I’ve been moving my stop loss up as the price has been going up. It did trigger at $22.26 for 6 shares so I have my investment back plus some and still have 6 shares remaining so I feel pretty dam good about it. 😀
2021-04-26 13:35:16,wallstreetbets,Same! 😍
2021-04-26 16:20:28,wallstreetbets,Good job!
2021-04-26 18:27:32,wallstreetbets,Anyone have more info on what the stock is possibly going to ?
2021-04-26 19:06:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, crazy shit I made $46 on my 5 shares."
2021-04-26 13:52:44,wallstreetbets,Lol you better take some gains before wsb ducks it up
2021-04-26 09:47:50,wallstreetbets,I am calling in sick. Selled the others.Bought 20K MVIS.
2021-04-26 10:42:34,wallstreetbets,Literally the same thing
2021-04-26 15:38:56,wallstreetbets,"I wanted to, but didn't have my account set up. Now I'm salty that I put that off"
2021-04-26 10:00:03,wallstreetbets,Made $800 since Friday w00t w00t 🚀🚀
2021-04-26 11:01:31,wallstreetbets,Woke up to 140$
2021-04-26 12:38:40,wallstreetbets,I'm up almost $1k since buying on Thursday. It's weird seeing green...
2021-04-26 11:10:03,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-26 17:07:29,wallstreetbets,Sold mind med a month ago and said I'd check out the company in a year. What a f up!
2021-04-26 14:30:32,wallstreetbets,"Same, when you selling?"
2021-04-26 16:45:01,wallstreetbets,Just set stop limit at a level your comfortable with. I’ve been in and out of MVIS several times. Took some losses when stops hit but just kept buying in again at lower price. Got in at $17 initially. Stop hit at around $15 the same day. Got in again at around $13.5. Stop hit at around $12. What I have now I bought at $10.22. I’ve been setting stops on half my shares the entire time. Didn’t have one trigger until $22.26. Sold half there. Right now I have it at $24.5 and am completely comfortable selling there if it triggers. All depends on how much risk your comfy with.  —— edit—— just saw price is at $27.77. Moved stop up to $26.25. Hope it keeps pumping but it feels good knowing what I’ll make at the bare minimum
2021-04-26 10:31:46,wallstreetbets,Same - I keep greedily buying. Let’s go!!!
2021-04-26 13:13:51,wallstreetbets,Same i just bought 830 at 22. No going back 😎
2021-04-26 16:51:51,wallstreetbets,"Just set a stop limit at a price your comfortable with. Right now it’s trading at $27.77. I’m up 157% and have already taken my original investment back so it’s all profit but I still keep moving my stop limit up. For me I just set it a little higher at $26.25. I’m greedy but if your worried about the bottom falling out and you want to relieve some stress about it, just set your stop at a limit your comfortable selling at"
2021-04-26 18:10:42,wallstreetbets,"Also a newbie, but I have seen people saying that they'll say when it goes way higher (like $80), at a buyout which apparently gets you shares of the buying company or 'til earnings"
2021-04-26 11:28:04,wallstreetbets,Hold till Thursday. Try to lower your average if you can
2021-04-26 12:09:56,wallstreetbets,"Options are the way for this play, even if premiums are sky high. Have to hit the sky before the moon !!!"
2021-04-26 11:39:17,wallstreetbets,Why is this so popular? From what I hear this is a long term play? Or are people using short term calls/puts?
2021-04-26 13:34:06,wallstreetbets,"Nicely done, I bought about 300. Standing by for liftoff"
2021-04-26 19:10:23,wallstreetbets,which strike and what expiration?
2021-04-26 18:11:39,wallstreetbets,forever the tendies shall grow
2021-04-26 19:57:35,wallstreetbets,"Nah, just don't show up and let them fire you.  Don't worry, you won't need to use them as a reference."
2021-04-26 09:48:13,wallstreetbets,"Im holding, i don't own much lol. But it is what it is."
2021-04-26 09:42:39,wallstreetbets,But is the moon 30$ ? I want to buy but don't want to be too late to join now.
2021-04-26 09:44:51,wallstreetbets,The beginning it is...News Thursdays. This is the way.
2021-04-26 10:30:38,wallstreetbets,I keep buying more!
2021-04-26 10:22:09,wallstreetbets,And after 28 $?
2021-04-26 10:36:14,wallstreetbets,Wow that what you think I will be happy if it will be 100 🤣
2021-04-26 10:45:15,wallstreetbets,$100!!
2021-04-26 11:13:41,wallstreetbets,I don't know if this would be possible but my guess is probably $ 50?
2021-04-26 12:15:45,wallstreetbets,"Competitors valued around $50 and MVIS is supposedly best in class so dumb math says at least that (and that’s not even including Hololens vertical) 

Waiting on results of A-Sample demo which is rumoured to be coming this Thursday with earnings"
2021-04-26 10:43:20,wallstreetbets,Hooooold
2021-04-26 10:30:56,wallstreetbets,No way - I keep buying more!
2021-04-26 10:54:59,wallstreetbets,It's only Monday bro
2021-04-26 10:09:40,wallstreetbets,That’s what people said on Friday 😅
2021-04-26 12:55:56,wallstreetbets,"Lol, you think that's bad...I closed $13 calls on Friday morning for 100% thinking I was a boss...those same calls now are about 1000%.  Doh"
2021-04-26 11:37:08,wallstreetbets,It's just the beginning I recommend before Thursday or it may be too late but even though today is much higher than last week it's still expected to atleast double/triple by then.
2021-04-26 12:29:19,wallstreetbets,I just bought more 🤑😜🙃😊😅
2021-04-26 11:22:15,wallstreetbets,Atleast you took your profit. Most here wont take the profits.
2021-04-26 10:34:23,wallstreetbets,"Yah i was a newbie and cashed mine during a dip, made a decent return but nothing in comparison to what's going on right now. Little heart break."
2021-04-26 10:24:36,wallstreetbets,It’s not too late.
2021-04-26 11:56:10,wallstreetbets,Just bought in again @22 already profit now ✌🏼 just sayin
2021-04-26 17:08:25,wallstreetbets,Nothing wrong with 300+% gains my man. I agree with hoddlers. Most here will buy at the top and be bag holdin at the bottom. Investing is all about taking gains and minimizing risk.
2021-04-26 10:41:29,wallstreetbets,It can’t. The short float is in no way comparable to GME.
2021-04-26 10:31:28,wallstreetbets,Mge went so high
2021-04-26 12:48:59,wallstreetbets,"When my wife’s brother asks me about this stock, its absolutely a future crash and burn situation. 

People who have only ever bought gme and had no idea why are now buying MVIS, that should concern the fuck out of people who bought above 20."
2021-04-26 11:39:47,wallstreetbets,What’s going on Thursday? I have MVIS 5/21 $21c that I’ve been holding for a while now.
2021-04-26 10:06:44,wallstreetbets,To low
2021-04-26 10:02:06,wallstreetbets,Way to low
2021-04-26 10:59:30,wallstreetbets,Between earth and Uranus
2021-04-26 10:59:15,wallstreetbets,Far beyond where we're at 👌(not a financial expert tho)
2021-04-26 17:19:42,wallstreetbets,Mine triggered at $22.26 for half my shares. Still about 120% so I have my investment back plus 20%. In cool with that. The other half is still gaining. I just keep moving my stop limit on those up as the share price rises. No matter what I’m guaranteed to win big on this one
2021-04-26 11:35:30,wallstreetbets,"Bought 4 shares. Also since im new to this, im using the robinhood app, do i just keep an eye on a companies shares until the buying price goes up enough to where i wanna sell?"
2021-04-26 12:53:02,wallstreetbets,"Anytime you hit that breakeven you can close it but it's up to you. July 16th it runs out so if it fell below again, you are OTM and the call goes away. If you think it'll keep going then leave it. Welcome to the casino lol"
2021-04-26 16:20:41,wallstreetbets,"$22.60, earlier this morning"
2021-04-26 17:21:43,wallstreetbets,22
2021-04-26 18:12:30,wallstreetbets,"Just watch this video.  These guys are next level tech

https://youtu.be/UHuSy6YENb8"
2021-04-26 11:12:18,wallstreetbets,I invested at .88 but only $150 :( have about 3k now
2021-04-26 10:07:34,wallstreetbets,🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘 HOOOOOLD  MVIS TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-04-26 09:50:05,wallstreetbets,Wondering the same. I got out of RKT at the right time and trying to figure out my exit strategy on this one.
2021-04-26 10:32:45,wallstreetbets,"Hold on this one. Wsb is only adding the rocket fuel right now, we haven’t even lifted off"
2021-04-26 11:02:56,wallstreetbets,"thats ok, it won't be a constant upward growth, it will fluctuate throughout the day but will continue with an upward trend through the week.  If its going down I would buy if you can, theres def an opportunity to make some cash."
2021-04-26 10:52:49,wallstreetbets,Just came here to see why. I’m in at $150 and it’s down almost 6% since I bought in.
2021-04-26 12:33:08,wallstreetbets,"Pending an Elon tweet or insane retail volume, the price targets look like 35-40 as the first point of resistance and then 45-50 after that. This isn’t a short squeeze like GME. This company has decent dd and LIDAR tech. I’m not saying it can’t go 🚀 🚀 but don’t expect it to just go to $100 overnight. 

Not financial advice"
2021-04-26 12:29:04,wallstreetbets,Nobody replies for this !! You keep an eye on it
2021-04-26 12:28:18,wallstreetbets,I put 100 dollars in this morming when the shares were about 20.00. About how much would you say is good to throw in for a good profit? I use the robinhood app.
2021-04-26 13:43:18,wallstreetbets,Another great option that just had a class action lawsuit filed against them...
2021-04-26 15:09:15,wallstreetbets,target price?
2021-04-26 18:25:07,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-26 17:25:38,wallstreetbets,"Jim Cramer said ""don't buy"" that's all the DD I needed"
2021-04-26 13:47:51,wallstreetbets,Man I tried to get an option call at $13 at open Friday but my order just wouldn't go through. I finally had to cancel and place another at $16. Luckily that one went through
2021-04-26 14:39:47,wallstreetbets,"Not OP but I was looking for some subs to learn projector mapping and somehow stumbled upon their sub. It's my first stock, so im pretty sure its all downhill from here lol"
2021-04-26 17:25:07,wallstreetbets,Cramer said don't buy. That's all the DD I needed
2021-04-26 15:56:35,wallstreetbets,There's a youtuber that talked about it at 0.50. Deadnsnyde
2021-04-26 17:43:08,wallstreetbets,"I don't think it's too late and if it makes you feel any better, I bought in today at $26 when my funds freed up."
2021-04-26 19:12:34,wallstreetbets,I bought because I yolo’d on oled and wanted a hedge against other upstart display technologies. Their move into lidar was news to me. I got in at about $1 but paper handed multiple times
2021-04-26 11:55:27,wallstreetbets,On percentage but i need that life changing $$
2021-04-26 12:47:16,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-04-26 12:24:16,wallstreetbets,"I use Fidelity, and it takes forever to ""settle"", but I can use my ""unsettled"" balance in a couple days"
2021-04-26 13:40:35,wallstreetbets,Even RH lets you use 1k immediately
2021-04-26 14:39:08,wallstreetbets,Maybe you can help. It says when I have under 2 grand I can only use cash funds. I have 75 bucks in cash funds but it won't let me buy anything with it. What am I missing. Thanks for any help
2021-04-26 13:00:41,wallstreetbets,That’s why the block chain is the future
2021-04-26 11:52:15,wallstreetbets,Sure there is. They want to validate the transfer before you invest money you don’t have because you lost it on Robinhood already.
2021-04-26 11:26:25,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately it blocked the trade.
2021-04-26 12:00:06,wallstreetbets,I mean 1 day is reasonable for an ACH transfer but 7 days *after* the transfer has landed is nonsense.
2021-04-26 19:08:58,wallstreetbets,"Awesome, congrats on the gains. Those 6 shares could double again!!"
2021-04-26 18:53:56,wallstreetbets,To the moon bby
2021-04-26 12:14:35,wallstreetbets,It’s a week long battle so don’t throw your weapons seeing the downfall. #StickTogther
2021-04-26 10:22:37,wallstreetbets,Nice!
2021-04-26 11:13:47,wallstreetbets,I sat too long. Had 3500 check to deposit sitting on my dashboard for a few weeks…if I had dropped it all at 12 last week. I’d be doing well.
2021-04-26 10:05:47,wallstreetbets,Same didn’t think those 35 dollar calls would make money so fast
2021-04-26 11:23:15,wallstreetbets,Up $2K for me
2021-04-26 13:08:51,wallstreetbets,it's weird making money just by being on my phone. since March 18 I'm up 189% on my investment. I'm just having some crazy stupid good luck. for God sakes I bet on a meme currency and it paid off. I'm kind of retarded.
2021-04-26 11:11:30,wallstreetbets,ain't much but this is what I could lose
2021-04-26 14:35:09,wallstreetbets,Before earnings and swapping to shares if I still feel bullish
2021-04-26 12:31:09,wallstreetbets,I'm on my 4th buy in 2wks. Started buying around $10. Most recent was at $21. No regrets.
2021-04-26 11:40:43,wallstreetbets,What is happening Thursday regarding MVIS?
2021-04-26 13:47:36,wallstreetbets,Sell Thursday?
2021-04-26 11:50:13,wallstreetbets,Potential buyout from Microsoft
2021-04-26 19:25:05,wallstreetbets,14 May 21
2021-04-26 10:54:57,wallstreetbets,"I'm with you! just picked up a little chunk, if it goes big I'll make a little cash and thats all I care about, unless the bottom falls out and I sell at a 85% loss, which is what usually happens to me, timing has never been my strong suit."
2021-04-26 13:05:49,wallstreetbets,"Just getting into the stock market and investing. Took a little bit to research, but here goes my first buy. Just bought a couple shares this morning."
2021-04-26 16:56:33,wallstreetbets,Well it just eclipsed it’s 52 week high at $24.18. It’s trading at $27.77 now. These are not normal every day stock gains. I mean it happens but don’t think this is typical. Who knows where the top is. Personally I bought in at $10.22. I was hoping it would get back over $17 this year. It’s already $10 over that in 3 days. This is a special kind of run up. I didn’t think GME would ever top $100 either though so who knows. Set stop limits at a price your comfortable with and enjoy the ride
2021-04-26 10:02:21,wallstreetbets,"For someone here $15 is late , $20 is late , $25 will be late , I can give you answer but I enjoy this and will hold until the end. It’s only 3rd continuous day gain. MVIS to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🤘🤘🤘"
2021-04-26 13:55:45,wallstreetbets,Do you like buying something for $20 when it was $2 6 months ago and no news or change have occured? Feel free to chase if you have a stop loss plan otherwise let this shoot up for to $30 for one day and then dump back to $6 and let wsb burn you again. If it's on the front page and everyone is  congratulating how smart they are you are too late and it's the top.
2021-04-26 10:18:56,wallstreetbets,"Moon is 300$, or more, like gme did.."
2021-04-26 09:59:01,wallstreetbets,Thursday gonna be crazy now. Most of us on MVIS subreddit did not expect a WSB surge and now there’s added pressure for the Thursday meeting to go really well. I doubt most WSBers are waiting for BO news and plan on dumping it by end of week too
2021-04-26 10:23:22,wallstreetbets,"$28 today, after 🚀🚀🚀🚀"
2021-04-26 10:41:59,wallstreetbets,"It’s $28 today , but yeah if it will be pass $100 today it will be renamed to spacemvis 😜. I don’t buy just for +10% . We are on 3rd continuously day gain just hooooold and we all enjoy this ride. MVIS to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🤘🤘🤘🤘"
2021-04-26 10:48:19,wallstreetbets,Tell me this will be like game?
2021-04-26 12:31:08,wallstreetbets,You think it will  go up to 100 or more?
2021-04-26 10:58:05,wallstreetbets,"thats what said too, broke down and bought in at 23 this morning.  fingers crossed"
2021-04-26 12:50:04,wallstreetbets,"And every day it goes up they become more and more right. If you didnt buy yesterday, its even dumber to buy the next day. 

Newbies have no concept of just waiting for a new opportunity. There is ALWAYS a new opportunity for patient people."
2021-04-26 12:01:02,wallstreetbets,You really think it's gonna 50-60? I got 210 shares and a call at around $10 and kinda wanna go all in and buy more shares
2021-04-26 11:59:46,wallstreetbets,I sold 6 un-namable coins when it was at $300 and thought I was clever for doubling my money...
2021-04-26 12:58:17,wallstreetbets,"Haha yeah I think this account is the equivalent of your wife’s brother, has like two weeks of comments and just spouts shit about holding at all costs"
2021-04-26 12:52:37,wallstreetbets,MVIS moved their earnings call that quarter a week in advance and apparently good news to be announced for the shareholders. Either way it’s bullish for the callings to be moved to this week instead of next week
2021-04-26 12:13:27,wallstreetbets,Something something ER?
2021-04-26 14:20:16,wallstreetbets,Based on?
2021-04-26 17:20:25,wallstreetbets,I strongly encourage you to learn about stop limits immediately and implement them
2021-04-26 13:14:33,wallstreetbets,"OK thanks, so ideally, I want to wait until it hits at least $30 to exercise.?
My portfolio says it's up like 400% from this option, so it's just a little confusing."
2021-04-26 10:41:49,wallstreetbets,"Holding on tight!  I only own 4 calls but, I don't mind taking the wait-and-see against theta...let's hope april 29th is good news."
2021-04-26 11:04:39,wallstreetbets,Ya you're right. I will buy more if its going down. Lets make a combine effort ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|slightly_smiling)
2021-04-26 11:04:48,wallstreetbets,Sounds good. Let’s make some cash!
2021-04-26 11:36:32,wallstreetbets,I bought it Thursday last week. Was down 500 at the end of the day. On Friday ended up 1000 so have faith.
2021-04-26 11:23:55,wallstreetbets,Ya those who bought during pre-market for those shares are still positive. But don't loose hope together we will make it happen![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|slightly_smiling)
2021-04-26 12:47:49,wallstreetbets,Okie dokie
2021-04-26 15:47:10,wallstreetbets,"Still has a high buy rating, and up over 5% today though. Why is the lawsuit not impacting this? Or is it something that we'll see the impact of soon?"
2021-04-26 15:17:21,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't mind seeing it hit 6.99+ on this uptrend.
2021-04-26 17:56:16,wallstreetbets,😂 I was just telling a friend of mine earlier how when Cramer says something I do the opposite and it usually works out....battleground my ass we're storming the beaches!!!
2021-04-26 19:14:55,wallstreetbets,"Dude, Creamer is the worst!"
2021-04-26 17:26:42,wallstreetbets,If you're using robinhood I have a guess
2021-04-26 15:55:14,wallstreetbets,The first one is always free.
2021-04-26 17:40:41,wallstreetbets,hey let me know if you find any good subs for projection mapping! I just got a lightform and I'm loving playing with it but I'm wanting to learn how to do more with it.
2021-04-26 18:59:51,wallstreetbets,which sub?
2021-04-26 12:31:04,wallstreetbets,"Yes, fuck that unsettled shit and ""good faith violations."" Obviously a margin account fixes that, but for some reason, they always deny my application. I called to find out why—I have what I'd think is plenty of capital, and good income, but they said they have no insight on the team's approval decisions. Soooo fucking annoying, given I've been with Fidelity for various products for years.

Going to apply for a TD account (since they have ToS) or Vanguard and see if they'll approve margin. I have it with WeBull and moomoo (and Robinhood if I pay), but I want it for OTC and stuff too."
2021-04-26 12:55:25,wallstreetbets,"settlement is usually 3 days, if you got margin you can float the settlements"
2021-04-26 16:42:00,wallstreetbets,"Isn't the bad faith violation basically if you sell it before your cash clears? So if you buy right away with the intention of holding it's not a bad faith violation?

Somewhat new to this."
2021-04-26 16:35:15,wallstreetbets,"I use fidelity too but because it takes so long for funds to settle, I use it mainly for long hold Penny stocks. Webull does the same thing. If I buy anything with unsettled funds I get a bad faith violation of my stop triggers so even though I despise Robin Hood and vowed never to use them again, I keep finding myself investing more and more using them simply because I have so much more freedom with my funds"
2021-04-26 18:41:11,wallstreetbets,Try 74 get back at me lol
2021-04-26 12:26:36,wallstreetbets,"Other places do it faster, but they're all too slow. Technology is better than that."
2021-04-26 11:31:46,wallstreetbets,"Damn sorry to hear it
Same thing happened to me with GME
Tried to buy in at $20 but Vanguard had a 2-3 day hold on new accounts, so I didn’t get in until $150 lol"
2021-04-26 12:25:23,wallstreetbets,You fell for that? I did not call-in sick! I'm at work! Yelling at people.
2021-04-26 12:09:15,wallstreetbets,"It’s all good. If she didn’t hold that $10 support last week, she would have dropped into the $8’s and you would have been kicking yourself. The main thing now, is she looks like she’s just turning on her boosters and there’s a seat for ya 🚀

I just like the stock. Not financial advice. I held heavy bags for awhile. Always invest wisely."
2021-04-26 10:06:21,wallstreetbets,I got in at $12 so just enjoying the ride
2021-04-26 11:46:50,wallstreetbets,I cashed out a 5/21 $22c this morning for $350 in profit. Still holding my shares.
2021-04-26 12:50:28,wallstreetbets,Same here! Didn't have a lot to invest but I got in in the $11-12 range.
2021-04-26 11:27:53,wallstreetbets,"I could only afford 116 shares, you must be in for a bit more than that I'm guessing.."
2021-04-26 15:38:20,wallstreetbets,"So, before Thursday?"
2021-04-26 12:44:17,wallstreetbets,^ this... third today at 22.  Bulk at 12 low xxx holding until buyout...
2021-04-26 12:12:23,wallstreetbets,Earnings and potential PR on A-sample demo
2021-04-26 11:57:00,wallstreetbets,Earnings
2021-04-26 11:58:16,wallstreetbets,Earnings report is coming out.
2021-04-26 15:20:51,wallstreetbets,Buyout or $80
2021-04-26 14:07:46,wallstreetbets,Thats on you. I’m personally holding till the buyout
2021-04-26 12:09:10,wallstreetbets,"And so much more! A sample results dropping, possible buyout, details about Microsoft’s Holo project"
2021-04-26 13:33:17,wallstreetbets,"I highly doubt that, that's more like a chance for a budget, no buyout at all ..  
Clearly you haven't done any DD :S"
2021-04-26 19:36:35,wallstreetbets,plot twist: they’re bought by nikola
2021-04-26 11:51:13,wallstreetbets,I bought at this morning’s end of the bull run. I’m in the red on this stock already 🤦🏻‍♂️
2021-04-26 11:56:02,wallstreetbets,"I'm with you, I took a major hit with $can bought in to high and then forgot to set stop loss"
2021-04-26 13:08:33,wallstreetbets,"same i just bought like a few shares, lol. But it's whatever. You know at least if i lose i lose. It's fine. I can afford to lose. because wallstreetbets/other news etc. Made me think it could be a possible good buy. So i bought some."
2021-04-26 10:57:12,wallstreetbets,"There is no way to tell, it could go belly up and fuck us all, or aliens could show up and shoot crayons up my ass, who knows...I sat and watched this stock go from 13 to 23 in the last few days, and every time I kept saying shit I'm too late, as it kept rising...so I YOLO'd at 23, fuck it."
2021-04-26 10:06:37,wallstreetbets,Okay...
2021-04-26 16:58:38,wallstreetbets,"^^^ this! If your buying in after it’s ran up over 150% in 3 days, just set a stop limit. It’s fine to try to catch on to a moon shot. It’s also fine to have realistic expectations of risk though"
2021-04-26 15:18:46,wallstreetbets,Thanks for being 100%
2021-04-26 10:40:59,wallstreetbets,It won’t go that high.
2021-04-26 11:07:20,wallstreetbets,"Probably a dumb question, but what’s happening Thursday?"
2021-04-26 10:27:04,wallstreetbets,I bought 3000$ at 20$ to put more? Where you think mvis will be at last
2021-04-26 10:44:45,wallstreetbets,"I am holding this stock already more then 1 month.
That’s why I am  asking?"
2021-04-26 10:54:28,wallstreetbets,Yessir (not a financial expert by the way!)
2021-04-26 12:12:58,wallstreetbets,"No, there’s a good reason for people to think share prices will go that high because of a potential buyout"
2021-04-26 17:43:20,wallstreetbets,"I originally bought at 57 cents last year, I love penny stocks...  when it was soaring a couple months ago I bough 100 shares at $23.34 then it tanked and I was sitting in a tub of my own tears.  I'm crossing everything you and I both."
2021-04-26 13:52:59,wallstreetbets,It's possible hard to tell but at the pace it's going I don't see the momentum slowing this week
2021-04-26 17:03:53,wallstreetbets,If your feeling anxious just exercise your options and set a stop limit your comfortable with on all your shares. Or set a stop limit on some of your shares at a price that at least gives you back your initial investment. It’s so much nicer enjoying a runup like this knowing that you can’t possible lose one red cent.
2021-04-26 18:15:53,wallstreetbets,"oh god

edit: now I don't feel bad for missing out on $20"
2021-04-26 13:14:33,wallstreetbets,I like this… It’s been holding onto my calls for the last month and a half so no reason to sell now!
2021-04-26 12:17:47,wallstreetbets,Gotcha. Thank you
2021-04-26 14:48:37,wallstreetbets,At this point is +43% only today. If you don’t believe in this it’s ok. I will continue to hold like many others .
2021-04-26 17:28:37,wallstreetbets,Okay i read up on them. Pretty simple. How can you set that up on the robinhood app or website?
2021-04-26 13:37:40,wallstreetbets,"It's up that much because that contract is in high demand. If MVIS stock was tanking right now, your contract would be worth less than what you paid for it.

Most people won't exercise an option contract. When you do that you are buying the shares, so in your case you would owe your brokerage $3000 ($30 strike price x 100)."
2021-04-26 17:46:21,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm, I don’t know. Guess just have to keep an eye on it and see what happens."
2021-04-26 18:09:48,wallstreetbets,"I have called it the anti-Cramer effect. 
This is not financial advice for your smooth brain"
2021-04-26 18:18:36,wallstreetbets,Everybody gets one
2021-04-26 17:50:25,wallstreetbets,"Lol so random. I have the lightform as well, love it so much! 

The best (but still not great) I found was /r/projector_mapping and /r/vjing I believe, then there's a few if you look for the most known software like /r/resolume and i was gonna say /r/madmapper but that one only has 150 subbers. 

I'm actually quite disappointed in lightform, the sub was inactive and i managed to get control over it ans handed it over to their team, but they haven't done anything with it. I could have grown out it a lot for them, and even did by plugging it on some FB groups. Those are actually pretty decent if you can stomach the FB format, I'm on Lightform Users and Lightform Learning Community. 

happy projecting bud! :)"
2021-04-26 16:47:12,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, that 'unsettled funds' thing is stupid. RH didn't do that, why not the others as well?"
2021-04-26 18:54:53,wallstreetbets,That’s exactly right. Swing trading is very doable  this way.
2021-04-26 18:54:17,wallstreetbets,Nah I've tried 50 thinking there's some kind of fee. No lucks. Ready to day fuck it and pull all my cash out. . ... If they let me.
2021-04-26 12:08:24,wallstreetbets,"Hahahaha same thing for me on GME, wanted in at 40$, got in at 71$. Didn’t matter though held past the squeeze and sold at 100$ like a chump"

2021-04-26 11:00:31,wallstreetbets,"I did at $13.90.

Haven’t made much cuz I was too afraid. This is the first stock I’ve r bought"
2021-04-26 11:32:11,wallstreetbets,Nah. I just put $800 in some calls on Friday. $30c. Got 6 of em. Sold for $$2600 today
2021-04-26 11:30:32,wallstreetbets,Or bought in way early.
2021-04-26 11:12:27,wallstreetbets,downvoted for having a working brain cell. lmao
2021-04-26 11:13:46,wallstreetbets,"A great way to learn is by getting a couple leads on here and then looking up the ticker. It will tell you they are releasing their earnings report.
I'm this case, earlier than anticipated which should mean good news...or... The reason for doing so is attached to even better news. When you're young, you don't run up to your parents with your report card as soon as you walk in the door if it sucks... You prolong that s#!t. 🤜🤛"
2021-04-26 11:11:08,wallstreetbets,Mvis historically runs up 40-50% on ANY PR news. Thursday specifically is the earnings call where everyone will ignore the actual earnings and await news on the HIGHLY anticipated demo they did of their automotive LiDAR module that was scheduled in April to private customers. There’s also a  slim chance that they will announce strategic partners or a buyout of the company which all results in the stock soaring even more
2021-04-26 11:08:54,wallstreetbets,They’re announcing earnings and demoing the product
2021-04-26 10:33:33,wallstreetbets,"I believe Friday around $150-170 but is to early to predict it , if we all continue to hold our position we can make higher, is all depends if we can handle this and just don’t afraid 🤘🤘🤘 I don’t buy MVIS for 10% I will stay hold and enjoy the ride 🤘🤘🤘"
2021-04-26 12:47:09,wallstreetbets,"Stop asking this maniac for advice, he is brand new to investing and selling insane ideas to other newbies"
2021-04-26 10:45:25,wallstreetbets,Wow 😳 you are 🤘🤘🤘
2021-04-26 10:57:12,wallstreetbets,I just bought 3000$ more 💪
2021-04-26 10:54:52,wallstreetbets,👍
2021-04-26 19:53:35,wallstreetbets,Correct mate
2021-04-26 18:38:15,wallstreetbets,"OMG, buying in at 50 cents is a dream, I hope you bought a ton! From what I'm seeing on various subs this could get pretty high, where buying in at 23 is still a deal."
2021-04-26 14:59:04,wallstreetbets,I'm still in Im just asking why you guys think it's going that high.
2021-04-26 18:27:09,wallstreetbets,"Hit the trade button. Then the sell button. Then up in the upper right corner click the little down arrow for more options besides shares. There you can opt for dollar amount instead is share amount but at the bottom there are several other options. One says “stop limit” click that click either stop order or stop limit order. Stop order allows you to sell at market price if the share price hits the price you set as your stop order. Stop limit order will trigger at whatever price you choose and then it will sell at whatever price you set. Basically the same thing as far as a simple stop order goes. I personally set my stop orders at 15-25% less than current market price. You can decide on whatever price you choose though. It just helps ensure that if a stock falls to a price you are uncomfortable holding at, then it will sell however many shares you set it at"

2021-04-26 17:56:46,wallstreetbets,"yeah they seem to be most active on their blog from what I've seen. I follow their FB page but don't see it in my feed a lot. Bummer that they aren't more active on sites like reddit. I'm already on r/vjing but r/projector_mapping isn't turning up any results? BTW I don't know the first thing about using them as I'm literally just starting out, but there's a couple free pieces of software I've found for making effects. You probably already know about blender, but I also for Django recently which looks a little simplistic but potentially useful. If you ever find a good community for projection mapping please drop me a line! Cheers and happy projecting to you too!"
2021-04-26 18:03:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I wonder what benefit Fidelity gains by not allowing it. I guess it's technically a loan until the purchase is executed. At least margin fixes it...if they'll approve you.

After I wrote that, I followed through and applied for a TD Ameritrade account. Took <10 minutes, and I was approved for margin on the spot during account creation, so ""free rides"" won't be a big deal there either. I probably won't pay to move things over, but I'll do new transactions there. (Making this the 5th brokerage I have a funded account with, ha.)"

I've heard Thursdays Q1 meeting and private customer LiDar show case should help us out, but this isn't my first stock take over. Sadly I also had invested in Sundial (SNDL) before Reddit came after it. I shoulda sold at the high of $3 but I didn't and lost a good opportunity."
2021-04-26 18:04:02,wallstreetbets,"My bad, /r/video_mapping was the one. Also found /r/lightingdesign but don't think I've checked it out. 

havent tried any software for creating yet but there's some great sites like pixabay.com where you can find a lot of free/cheap videos and animations to get you going in no time. google some stock vid sites and theres a bunch. 

They're not too active but the mentioned communities on FB are pretty big and mostly very helpful if you're stuck or looking for feedback. 

Appreciate the tips, will def check them out!"

With an enterprise value of c. $40 billion and ARR of $580 million as of January 2021, the company is valued at an EV / ARR multiple of >70x. Thats a rich valuation. In comparison, the median EV / ARR multiple of [Meritech’s SaaS index](https://www.meritechcapital.com/public-comparables/enterprise#/public-comparables/enterprise/comps-table) is 22x for a growth rate of 34%.

2021-04-26 10:20:19,wallstreetbets,I think it is 100% inflated. I bought blue prism awhile back who is a direct competitor of theirs and it hasn’t gotten even close to the level of this PATH IPO. Bullish on the RPA software space in the next 10 years though.
2021-04-26 10:28:11,wallstreetbets,Blue Prism is the deep value play on RPA software. Blue Prism has 1/3rd the revenue of UiPath yet Path is trading at 23 times the market cap.

2021-04-26 11:32:49,wallstreetbets,"If you knew anything about the RPA space, you would know that BP is a dinosaur and handed UiPath its #1 spot due to lack of innovation and overall stagnation.  They are now being pushed off the leaderboards by Forrester and soon Gartner.  The better play if you think PATH is overpriced is wait for the inevitable AA IPO (unless they get bought out first)."

2021-04-26 11:15:13,wallstreetbets,"As a UK company they probably were incentivized to list on a domestic exchange since their government is desperately trying to promote growth and investment in their country. Obviously Europeans can't properly value high growth companies, particularly in technology and enterprise software. Hopefully a US listing will come this year, American investors will likely value it about 10 times the current price."
2021-04-26 11:20:08,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I get it. The LSE is only good for boomer stocks (oil, gas and mining companies). The investor pool is really shit for tech companies.

If you read the original, you can just look for the* ***Updates:.***

***1.*** ***Intro***

Greetings Apes and Apettes! I'm excited and a little scared to post my first DD here. I learned of WSB like many of you and have been commenting and trying to be a good ape since January when I jumped on the GaymeStonk hype train. While I knew quite a bit about the market due to my work and education, I will admit that my investment strategy up to this point has been ""buy Vanguard Index Funds."" Safe, but boring. Being a part of this community has pushed me to go out of my comfort zone and finally make an ape gamble on something other than buying GaymeStonk shares.

So, I've been reading your DDs, watching the financial news, and just generally paying more attention to the markets in search of my first options play. I need to earn my stripes, one way or another, and I have found my first target: [$LADR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LADR?p=LADR).

***2.*** ***The Target: $LADR***

**Ladder Capital Corp** is a REIT traded on the NYSE with a market cap of just under 1.5BN. It's not a huge company by any stretch and options volume is a little low, but hopefully not so low that this post gets clipped. The company was started after the 2008 crash by three former executives who all worked for an internal real estate hedge fund at UBS. That HF collapsed after making investments in the subprime housing market. **I'm sure they learned their lesson and vowed** ***never to do that again***. RIGHTTTTT.

In fact, what they're doing now is *probably worse*, though the fallout may not be on the same scale as what happened in 2008. After all, the entire CMBS market is only **\~$500B**, as opposed to the residential housing market at \~**$8T** just before the crash (btw, current housing market sits at \~**$35T** \*\*\*whistles\*\*\*)**.** So, even if the entire CMBS industry goes tits up, we're not looking at a complete economic meltdown like we had in 2008, *unless it causes other dominos to fall, but that's another topic..*. Anyway, we can still make money if the thesis is correct, right? So, read on, dear apes.

What set me down this path was [this recent article](https://theintercept.com/2021/04/20/wall-street-cmbs-dollar-general-ladder-capital/), which someone coincidentally linked in a GaymeStonk thread. Weird, I know, but take a read if you have a few minutes as it forms the basis of my thesis.

***Update: If you're an ape who can't read, you can watch this video that the author of the Intercept article and Flynn did with The Hill last week:*** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=pRHwhvUc54A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=pRHwhvUc54A) ***Thanks*** /u/_dmm ***for the link!***

Reading this article first is sort of putting the cart before the horse, but the main point is that [Professor John M. Griffin](http://www.jgriffin.info/bio/) from UTA, decided to do a forensic analysis of claims made by an SEC whistleblower and found those claims to be **correct**. The claims will be discussed in one second, but just know that this guy's specialty is ""*forensic finance, or understanding the role of anything that is potentially illegal, illicit or immoral in financial markets*."" If you want to read the actual paper Mr. Griffin published, you will definitely develop some extra brain wrinkles. The paper can be found [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3671162). It's a good, but technical, read.

Anyway, according to Griffin, the worst offenders when it comes to income overstatement are shown on the right side of this graph:

[Most of the shadow banks above the line on this chart are probably decent put plays](https://preview.redd.it/e34jcp09aiv61.jpg?width=840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3b14dca2e49628d3360d4d656d71893bbd1e233)

*Smol aside*: *I was curious if John Griffin and Kenny Griffin from Shitadel are related or if it's pure coincidence that they have the same last name. I can't find anything saying they are related, so let's chalk it up to a common last name. That said, it appears that Shitadel thinks $LADR is garbage, too, as* [*they have been getting rid of their shares and have purchased substantial additional puts*](https://fintel.io/so/us/ladr/citadel-advisors-llc)*. I feel dirty that I may be on the same side of a bet as Kenny G, but what's an ape gonna do???*

Anyway, the genesis of the Griffin study was a 2019 SEC whistleblower complaint that is discussed in this Pro Publica article from **May of 2020:** [https://www.propublica.org/article/whistleblower-wall-street-has-engaged-in-widespread-manipulation-of-mortgage-funds](https://www.propublica.org/article/whistleblower-wall-street-has-engaged-in-widespread-manipulation-of-mortgage-funds). The article describes a complaint filed by [John Flynn](https://commercialobserver.com/2018/07/john-flynn-cmbs-transparent/), [a veteran of the CMBS industry](http://creloanadvisors.com/), which alleges rampant overstating of borrower income to prop up shitty loans that were packaged into CMBS by 14 major lenders including Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo, and our target Ladder Capital Corp. The world renowned plaintiff's class action attorneys at **Quinn Emanuel** have taken note of the impending CMBS market correction and issued a very detailed and easy to read [firm memo](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/the-firm/publications/us-outlook-potential-cmbs-litigation-arising-from-the-2020-downturn/) on the subject, which explains the myriad ways this thing could fall apart.

Anyway, $LADR isn't just taking loans originated by unrelated mortgage loan officers from various banks around the country and packaging those up into shitty CDOs. No no; they are **originating the loans themselves** and then packaging those crap loans together with other, better looking loans, and then **securitizing the garbage for their customers in an inflated CMBS.** I shit you not. Seems weird to risk your reputation by selling crap, but more on that later.

On top of the above, the firm appears to be engaging in some pretty shady practices when repackaging loans acquired from other lenders that had been part of a previous a CMBS that was unwound. Flynn's whistleblower complaint states that Ladder has been revising the previous income statements of the borrowers such that their **net profits were overstated anywhere from 10-30%** from what was reported by the prior lender, meaning they were given much larger loans than they are capable of paying off.

All of this just screams SHORT THIS SHIT, but if you want another reason to hate on Ladder, and I'm not trying to make this political, note that one of Ladder's largest investors is **Steven Ross.** If you don't know him, let's just say he's a billionaire BFF with 45 and, get this, Ladder is [one of the Trump organization's biggest creditors.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/08/09/billionaire-stephen-ross-holds-stake-in-one-of-trumps-biggest-creditors/?sh=7a2848863af4) Whatever you think about Trump as a President, one thing we know for certain is that he's [not that great at real estate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html)**. Seriously, don't make this political**. This is about *fraud and bad bets in the CRE market*, not politics.

The final point I will make here is that the outlook for CRE for 2021 is just not that good overall, to say nothing of the CMBS market. The [National Association of Realtors is predicting](https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2020-q4-commercial-real-estate-trends-and-outlook-survey-01-21-2021.pdf) Q1 2021 CRE prices ""to decrease in the office market (-3% y/y), retail (-6% y/y), and hotel/hospitality (-6% y/y)."" Guess what markets $LADR is heavily invested in? That's right; [office, retail, and hospitality](https://s2.q4cdn.com/455099226/files/doc_downloads/company_overview/2021/03/Ladder-Capital-Company-Overview-(March-2021).pdf).

***3. Timing***

So, this shit is shady and Ladder seems ripe for a fall, along with the rest of the CMBS market. In fact, I think you could make this bet against most of the offending lenders identified in the Griffin study, but especially against the shadow banks like Ladder. Thus, the real question is; **when lambo**???

This is a REALLY tough question and where this play certainly opens the door to either major gain or major loss porn. ***Please, only bet what you're able to lose***.

The problem, of course, is that the market was made aware of this malfeasance when Flynn filed his complaint **in February 2019**. Flynn was under the assumption that 10 year commercial loans sold in the run up to 2008 crash would be defaulting in 2017-2018, but that didn't happen. From the Quinn Emanuel memo: ""*Commercial loans backing CMBS typically have a shorter term than the residential mortgage loans backing RMBS, and a different amortization schedule. For example, a standard CMBS loan will have a 10-year term during which it will pay mostly interest and very little (or no) principal, with a large “balloon” payment of principal at the end. Often, the loan is refinanced at the end of its term, meaning that some or all of the balloon payment becomes the subject of a new loan, with a new term, which is frequently then secured in a new CMBS.*"" So, when the original CMBS 1.0 loan defaults didn't show up in the market, Flynn started digging and found that the original loans had simply been repackaged and papered over to new investors based on the **newly restated and inflated NOI** numbers, which triggered his SEC complaint.

But, the SEC hasn't acted on the complaint (AFAIK) and the market just didn't give a shit. Oh yeah, his complaint isn't actually public, either. What's more, Feb 2019-Mar 2020 was a banner year for CMBS returns and commercial real estate in general. Further, most analysts of the CMBS market agree that the new ""CMBS 2.0"" market is much healthier than the CMBS 1.0, i.e. pre-2008, market, so ***there's a chance I am completely wrong on this***.

All that said, the $LADR stock price did plunge from its ATH of $19 in Feb 2020 to about $3 in March 2020 due to the **COVID scare** that caused a broader market downturn at that time, but it has steadily inched back up to where it is today, at around **$11**. How can that be if their business is built on a pack of lies?

Well, as the Pro Publica article mentions, the Fed [threw a bunch of money at the CMBS market via the CARES Act](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200409a.htm) last April (PPP, mortgage forbearance, etc.), which likely kicked the can down the road. And while Biden's recent **$1.9T** **American Rescue Plan** doesn't contain any *direct support* for the CMBS industry, it's clear that the QE provided by that plan will likely push any widespread CMBS correction further into 2021 or 2022. This aligns with some speculation by the Motley Fool (\*throws up a little\*) back in June that people should keep their eyes open for CMBS failures ""[over the next 12 to 24 months](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-financing/articles/cmbs-fraud-allegations-propublica-and-industry-veteran/)."" There's also an outside chance that the [2020 Hope Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7809?r=98&s=1), which ""*establishes an equity facility in the Department of the Treasury to assist commercial mortgage borrowers*,"" could still pass and kick this failure can further down the road.

All that said, my prediction is that we'll likely see a *short term uptick* in the CRE market as businesses come back on-line following the easing of COVID restrictions, but this won't be enough to save the market from bad underwriting. The [Griffin study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3671162) supports this when it says, on page 4, that ""*the difference between dubious and duteous originators will persist after the current COVID crisis.*"" So, we'll eventually see the house of cards collapse and I'm going to bet it does so **by the end of this year or early next year**. Now, if there is some wider market correction \*\*\*cough CLO/Treasury collapse\*\*\*, this could all happen *much sooner*. Note, the farthest out you can buy puts on this stock is 12/17/2021. \*\*\*sad trombone\*\*\*

I will also be paying close attention to the $**LADR** **Q1 earnings release on May 3, 2021.** Current EPS consensus is .08/share, which is the same as it was for Q4 2020, but which the company missed by .03/share (actual EPS was .05/share). Note, the company issued a dividend of $.20/share in the lead up to their Q4 2020 earnings report, and they have [done the same for Q1 2021](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ladder-capital-corp-announces-first-201500466.html). Accordingly, I'm also predicting **a** **30% miss on EPS for Q1 2021**, just like Q4 last year. I don't anticipate, however, that this EPS miss will have a huge impact on share price. Might drop it a buck or so in the short term. The real fall will come when their shitty loans start going bad later this year.

***4. Target Price***

As far as price goes, this is where I get out of my depth. I am just not equipped to crunch all these numbers from the articles and read financial statements and all that shit in order to say the company is going to drop by X%, so I'm just going with my gut feeling here. **I would really love some help on this point from some wrinkly brain apes who are good with numbers.**

So, I'm just going to look at what happened to the stock back in March 2020 and say that it will probably happen again when the shit hits the fan; ***the price will drop to around \~$4-5/share.***

***5. Counterarguments***

So, there are obviously a lot of counterarguments on which I would be happy to get some feedback. I have considered these, but maybe not weighted them strongly enough, in drawing my conclusions. I welcome your comments and criticism on these and any other counterarguments I may have missed:

* Even if $LADR is chronically overstating the income of their borrowers, the value of **the underlying real estate may be sufficient collateral** to stem any losses from widespread defaults.
* **Most analysts are bullish on this stock**, with the consensus rating now being to **buy**. Current analyst price target range is $12.50 - $14.00 with **an average of $12.80/share**.
* As the Intercept article posted above notes, Ladder's ""[three largest tenants are Dollar General, BJ’s, and Walgreens.](https://theintercept.com/2021/04/20/wall-street-cmbs-dollar-general-ladder-capital/)” This is good for Ladder given the current inflationary economic environment as consumers are looking for ways to save money and discount retailers benefit from this. In fact, Dollar General is having an amazing year. Their stock price has gone up about [55%](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/DG#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--) from **$140** following the March 2020 crash to **$218** yesterday. So, **if Ladder's largest tenants continue to do well, Ladder may be able to absorb/mitigate any loses** from their poor underwriting for other borrowers.
   * ***Update:*** /u/steveressi12 ***and*** /u/_dmm ***both note that DG isn't actually doing that well. DG apparently has a Debt:Asset ratio of 75% (I haven't been able to independently verify this number). DG is also going to*** [**hire an additional 20,000 employees**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dollar-general-dg-hiring-spree-130201383.html) ***soon, which will significantly increase their expense load. This is bad news for their ability to pay back their debt. Lots of bearish DG articles on Yahoo! Finance in the last week. I may do some further DD on DG, as it looks like that may be another good bearish play. Guess I'm becoming a*** 🌈🐻?
* **Ladder's business is not limited to CMBS origination and securitization**. They also are a commercial landlord, which could, again, offset any losses from their CMBS shenanigans.
* **Ladder won't be holding the bag** if these CMBS fail; *their investors will*. As the Flynn study notes; ""*the loan originator is not paid according to the loan’s future performance, but from fees and markups when the loan is sold... \[Accordingly,\] originators and underwriters may have incentives to build and burn their reputation.*"" So, there's always a possibility that **these securities fail, but** **Ladder survives**.
   * ***Update:*** /u/steveressi12 ***notes that Ladder's weighted LTV is about 67% (another number I did not independently calculate), which should be sufficient to weather a few defaults, ""barring a major uptick in cap rates across different CRE spectrums."" S/he also notes a weighted average remaining term of 13 months might be ""odd for a portfolio of that size"" and that ""their unencumbered asset to unsecured debt ratio is relatively thin (1.74x vs. 1.50x typical unsecured facility covenant) and loans that are struggling are typically marked down more aggressively within 12 months of maturity... All in all it should be an no \[sic\] interesting two quarters to see what they do.""***

***6. Closing***

Boy, if you've read this far, I really appreciate you and would welcome your thoughts and criticism.

I feel pretty good about this thesis, but not good enough to YOLO, since it's my first time doing something like this. In fact, I've only made a very small investment by purchasing the following Puts:

* **20 x 12/17/2021 $7.50p @ $.25/share**

***Update:*** ***The following math is just the easiest way to calculate a potential gain on this play.*** /u/greenday10Dsurfer ***pointed out that the EV/IV of these options could actually result in a bigger gain than this depending on if/when the stock crashes. The thing I will be watching is the premium on these contracts. If it goes above $2.25/share I will be doing better than the below scenario.***

If I'm correct, my potential gain is **\~900%:**

|Cost of Contracts (20 contracts @ .25/share = 2000 shares x .25 = $500) + $20 commission|$520|
|:-|:-|
|Cost of 2000 shares @ $5 price target|$10,000|
|Right to sell 2000 shares @ $7.50 strike|$15,000|
|Profit from share sale|$5,000|
|Profit minus cost of contracts|$4,480|
|Total Return (4480/500)|**896%**|

Yes, a \~$4.5K profit on a $500 investment is **small potatoes**, but I want to dip my toe in the water and see if my ape brain is working properly before taking bigger risks.

Let me know what I missed, fellow apes and, again, thanks for reading!

2021-04-26 14:05:42,wallstreetbets,"I have to say this is some nice work. However, I don't fully agree. Dollar General is a top class tenant and they pay their rent. as long as they pay their rent, everything is fine. The value of the real estate that underlies dollar general is very specific and tied to its use as a dollar general store...this is a risk. The practice that Ladder lends itself money to buy these dollar generals, then sells these loans in CMBS at lower yields is common for CMBS shops and frankly genius. It's called arbitrage. The claim that they are overstating income on these CMBS packages seems pretty speculative as underwriting is an art. These loans may have been recently stabilized and undergone a business transformation which could explain a discrepancy in actuals vs. UW income.

&#x200B;

I am of the opinion that Ladder won't collapse and they are really good at finance and making money...although I do not like the company."

This tells me the practices might be shady but for them to get crushed financially the entire market needs to tank, and they’ll be at the tail end if it (think Novastar in ‘08). Probably a good one to keep an eye on but for me if I were to buy puts they’d probably need to be mid to late 22 to have impact of bad cmbs dealings turn into a stock route."

Several forecasters say the month of June is the correction.  I suspect the hedgies are leading the media to believe that and will bring a early to mid May major dip surprise for investors world wide.

Just my opinion and I have no solid proof."
2021-04-26 17:40:27,wallstreetbets,"I read all of your post, all of The Intercept article, and most of the two Emmanuel memos.  I have also been reading about possible causes of a future market crash over the past 6 months.  I think the shared prediction of a CMBS-driven market crash is not only correct but it is 100% inevitable and unavoidable.

HOWEVER:

1) This is going to be near impossible to time properly, especially with options.  At a minimum we would want to wait for either a climbing CMBS delinquency rate (currently 4.3% and falling) or a big surge in CMBR disputes.  Then there is also the government kicking the can down the road which sure as shit can and will outlast our options.

2) Ladder won’t be the bagholder - investors that bought their dogshit products will.  Since they get paid at sale and are completely free from future consequence monetarily, I don’t see their stock price taking any kind of massive dive until we’re in the thick of the crash, at which point puts on anything on the market would be green.

So, if you feel like this is a high conviction play, then you can risk it for the biscuit with LEAPs (or the closest thing to it).  Alternatively you could short for a longer play (don’t kill me).

But for me, I think it is too early to try to time this thing, especially with the numbers moving in the wrong direction currently.  So for those reasons, I’m out."

2021-04-26 10:42:09,wallstreetbets,TLDR- give me a strike and a date
2021-04-26 15:47:28,wallstreetbets,"1.  CMBS structures are the most simple in the securitization universe.  Straight plain vanilla waterfall.  If AM vs. AJ does not convey very specific meaning to you, you don't know enough about CMBS to even pretend to know something about CMBS.
2. If you have a BBerg terminal, you can look at every loan in every deal, trivially.  Anyone buying this shit should have a BBerg terminal and know how to use it.
3. As for putting ""shitty"" loans in with ""good"" loans into a deal, not necessarily a CDO, but a CMBS, what is wrong with that?  That is the entire reason for doing CMBS.  It is ""more efficient"" in that you putting the high-yield stuff in to get a higher total return on the investment.  The probability of default is accounted for if you are not a moron, and you are taking a bet that you can get more dough out of the deal than it costs to finance the position if you are a hedge fund, or will beat an index if you are a doing money management.
4. These guys have cut risk like crazy since last year.  Look at their balance sheet: [https://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?FilingID=14748711-152969-157455&type=sect&TabIndex=2&dcn=0001577670-21-000009&nav=1&src=Yahoo](https://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?FilingID=14748711-152969-157455&type=sect&TabIndex=2&dcn=0001577670-21-000009&nav=1&src=Yahoo)  Loans out standing down $1B, carried CMBS down $0.5B, cash up nearly $1.B.
5. This took all of five minutes to look at that.  Speculation on what Kenny G is doing with respect to this and the option market is wanking in the dark.  You have no idea.
6. CMBS is likely to get into trouble, but you are only going to make money on that if you do CDS, get paid to beat an index, or wait around to pick over the carcasses like everyone did after 2008.

The bottom line is that these guys might suck, but this not in any way clear from what was presented.  If the management came from UBS, that was indeed an extraordinary cesspool of humanity, so one should not expect them to do anything honorable or honest.  Additionally, they are near retirement age, and so would not feel bad milking the cow until it dies.  

You just have no idea what is going on here, this is a total punt.  Besides, the chart doesn't look that bad given what is going on with rates and all."

2021-04-26 18:01:46,wallstreetbets,Very fair criticism and definitely a big risk for this bet. Thanks for taking the time to read and comment!
2021-04-26 12:25:10,wallstreetbets,This may be my one and only ever bearish bet depending on how this plays out. LOL
2021-04-26 17:42:35,wallstreetbets,Agree that this is a big risk.
2021-04-26 10:27:56,wallstreetbets,"Noted in my counterarguments, but it's a definite concern. 

That said, LADR definitely is still the lender on the underlying note, so they are the ones who have to try to recoup the loses by foreclosing the note/mortgage if the loan goes into default. If there are too many defaults, the CMBS collapses and it all rolls back down to the original lender."
2021-04-26 10:44:52,wallstreetbets,">20 x 12/17/2021 $7.50p @ $.25/share

Might be safer to wait until 2022 contracts open up, but the above is what I bought."
2021-04-26 16:24:43,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the reply, especially the data in point 4. 

As to the rest, I'm not sure I agree as your premise seems to be that if someone doesn't have an insider's amount of knowledge regarding the CMBS market, they don't have the ability to read and understand **research by people who do.** 

That's like saying ""you can't understand a newspaper article unless you're a journalist."" It's just not true, IMO. 

I read the Griffin study cover to cover. It's the exact type of research you're saying people should do to understand this. Well, why do I need to do the research myself if an expert has already done it and concluded this shit is shaddy? 

That all said, I think the biggest problem with my bet is timing. It could very well not play out until 2022. Hell, it may never play out and I have acknowledge that, but this is a casino and I like my odds."

2021-04-26 09:15:54,wallstreetbets,"When the world needed him most, he disappeared..."
2021-04-26 19:19:44,wallstreetbets,"Once again...  Cramer is a hero. This subreddit does a great many things right, but the insanity on attempting to trash talk a man, who has LITERALLY financially educated millions of people out of poverty to the point where they fight against the system, with the same ideas/ideals that this rebellion was founded on is idiotic. 

Perhaps the term apes is correct. There is a saying the the Robinhood trader knows nothing. They can't read a balance sheet, calculate a PEG, P/E, or a stock multiple. They don't do an hour of homework per stock they own, they don't diversify, & they overspeculate among many other cardinal sins. This is why the majority of them are bagholders & why Robinhood themselves was able to take advantage of them during the GME fiasco - because none of them actually read the EULA, terms, & other legal mumbo jumbos, nor did the have any other legit accounts (ie: Fidelity) like myself which never stopped trading. 

Had you listened to Cramer you all would have made much more money. Been able to buy & sell this stock repeatedly 5 to 10 times over by now & transferred so much wealth from the rich to the poor that the term ""Robinhood"" would have been shoved down those crooked little bastard's mouths.

Perhaps you should read his books like I have & understand the context in which he speaks instead of just being like many of the fake news spreaders of this world - ie: Grandma & her OAN buddies just sharing claims of election fraud on her Facebook account & actually fact check things yourself instead of seeing or hearing a clip about someone & taking it out of context & thinking they are the enemy. 

Cramer is & was one of the first apes... & He laid some of the earliest ground work for us to be here. Those that are not apes... But worse.... Neanderthals are the only ones dumb enough to mock him, & the ones blindly following in that mocking are the lemmings of said Neanderthals. How bad is it to be so mindless that you follow the mindless? 

In Cramer We Trust. Diamond Hands. Screw Melvin Capital. GameStonk WSB4Lyfe. 

These things are all the same."

Fellow WSB member

Amongst the amazing feats of video magic include 'take on me', 'sledgehammer', 'thriller', 'bohemian rhapsody', 'ghostbusters', 'jurrasic park', and 'the ten commandments', which are still gold standards of video and story telling, have been deemed too dated for the world today. A relic of a bygone era.

A day may come when certain graphics and stories meet their obsolescence. Beyond their time, old and decrepit, sent to the grave for not being strong or as good as they could have been... but it is not this day!

When we are dictated to by the future fiction of the world and told what to believe is right and which is an illusion... but it is not this day!

This day we fight! 

Against the negatives of the world and show support for such great imagination and creativity. I bid you stand, Ape of WSB!"

Ironically gandalf is a lower tier god and quite immortal while pippin is a hobbit which is a type of man, and men specifically do not go to valinor as gandalf describes, only elves go there when they die.

They do all of the leg work and word of their mission travels by multiple avenues (the trees who are slow to take action, the undead ghost army dormant in a bog).  Meanwhile the enemy just keeps getting stronger.  Think Voldemort with an army of orcs.   I think this might be one of the scenes at the end where they are trying to defend this fortress and it looks like yet AGAIN they are about to get their asses handed to them, but then ALL of the allies show up, last frigging minute (the trees, the ghost army yadda yadda) and they obliterate the enemy."

2021-04-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"BlackBerry Stock Is a Top Turnaround Play BlackBerry stock: It’s still a sexy play in my books

BlackBerrry’s collaboration with Amazon.com Web Services (AWS) is truly something to get really excited about, global agreement to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud.  Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences.

BlackBerry IVY addresses a critical data access, collection, and management problem in the automotive industry.  Modern cars and trucks are built with thousands of parts from many different suppliers, with each vehicle model comprising a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components. These components, which include an increasing variety of vehicle sensors, produce data in unique and specialized formats. The highly specific skills required to interact with this data, as well as the challenges of accessing it from within contained vehicle subsystems, limit developers’ abilities to innovate quickly and bring new solutions to market. BlackBerry IVY will solve for these challenges by applying machine learning to that data to generate predictive insights and inferences, making it possible for automakers to offer in-vehicle experiences that are highly personalized and able to take action based on those insights.

BlackBerry IVY will support multiple vehicle operating systems and multi-cloud deployments in order to ensure compatibility across vehicle models and brands. It will build upon BlackBerry QNX’s capabilities for surfacing and normalizing data from automobiles and AWS’s broad portfolio of services, including capabilities for IoT and machine learning. BlackBerry IVY will run inside a vehicle’s embedded systems, but will be managed and configured remotely from the cloud. As a result, automakers will gain greater visibility into vehicle data, control over who can access it, and edge computing capabilities to optimize how quickly and efficiently the data is processed. With BlackBerry IVY’s integrated capabilities, automakers will be able to deliver new features, functionality, and performance to customers over the lifetime of their cloud-connected vehicles, as well as unlock new revenue streams and business models built on vehicle data.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8jnz4dg4iv61.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=332562ea2e475ec71455d52feb6aee9b907d454f

For instance, BlackBerry IVY could leverage vehicle data to recognize driver behavior and hazardous conditions such as icy roads or heavy traffic and then recommend that a driver enable relevant vehicle safety features such as traction control, lane-keeping assist, or adaptive cruise control. IVY could then provide automakers with feedback on how and when those safety features are used, allowing them to make targeted investments to improve vehicle performance. Additionally, drivers of electric vehicles could choose to share their car’s battery information with third-party charging networks to proactively reserve a charging connector and tailor charging time according to the driver’s current location and travel plans. BlackBerry IVY could also provide insights to parents of teenage drivers who may choose to receive customized notifications based on insights from vehicle sensors when the number of passengers in the vehicle changes, when the driver appears to be texting, distracted, or not observing speed limits, or when the vehicle occupancy level rises above the parents’ desired safety threshold. Similarly, parents of infants could receive a reminder to engage the child safety lock when the vehicle detects a child in the rear seat.

BlackBerry IVY will enable automakers to compress the timeline to build, deploy, and monetize new in-vehicle applications and connected services across multiple vehicle brands and models. Instead of investing in one-off solutions that conform to the unique engineering of different vehicle models (as they do today), automakers using BlackBerry IVY will be able to leverage different types of data as common building blocks for new services that could work across a range of models. Automakers will be able to use the platform’s application programming interfaces (APIs) to share data and outputs with their software development teams, giving them the ability to innovate, while also protecting customer privacy and security by controlling whom can access vehicle and app data and at what level of detail.

In addition, BlackBerry IVY will make it easier for automakers to collaborate with a wider pool of developers to accelerate creation of new offerings that deliver improved vehicle performance, reduced costs for maintenance and repairs, and added convenience. For instance, by analyzing real-time performance data, automakers could recognize the first signs of potentially faulty parts, deploy code to identify affected vehicles, notify impacted drivers, and perform targeted recalls. Automakers will be able to remotely deploy and update the software from the platform’s Cloud Console (a web interface for managing BlackBerry IVY) to continuously improve the functionality of the system.

“Data and connectivity are opening new avenues for innovation in the automotive industry, and BlackBerry and AWS share a common vision to provide automakers and developers with better insights so that they can deliver new services to consumers,” said John Chen, Executive Chairman and CEO, BlackBerry. “This software platform promises to bring an era of invention to the in-vehicle experience and help create new applications, services, and opportunities without compromising safety, security, or customer privacy.  We are pleased to expand our relationship with AWS to execute this vision and deliver BlackBerry IVY.”

“AWS and BlackBerry are making it possible for any automaker to continuously reinvent the customer experience and transform vehicles from fixed pieces of technology into systems that can grow and adapt with a user’s needs and preferences,” said Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, Inc. “Through this joint effort with BlackBerry, we will provide automakers with the insights, capabilities, agility, and speed they need to thrive in an increasingly connected world. As automakers seek to race ahead in their digital transformations, BlackBerry IVY empowers them to build their brands and set the standard for connected vehicle services across the automotive industry.”

The future looks bright for BlackBerry

&#x200B;

I believe the collaboration on project IVY with Amazon Web Services (AWS) could evolve to become a major needle-mover for BlackBerry stock, as it continues to push toward meaningful organic growth to finally prove itself to the skeptical analysts that maintain their hold ratings and single-digit price targets.

BlackBerry stock has collapsed, yet IVY is still happening, and contrarians should be as excited as ever as the company looks to spread its wings in the auto market, which may be on the cusp of exploding higher on the back of EVs (electric vehicles) and autonomous driving technology.

Although the QNX business hasn’t recovered as quickly as most investors would have hoped, I still think BlackBerry stock is a great value bet for those willing to put up with turbulence for the next three to five years. Looking ahead to the post-pandemic environment and things are likely looking up for QNX and many other segments that have fallen under pressure due to COVID-19.

Add IVY into the equation and I think BlackBerry may be shaping up to be one of the greatest Canadian turnaround stories of all time.

TLDR

Stay the course and put your trust in the hands of CEO John Chen, and I do think you’ll be happy with the rewards to be had over the next decade. The stock is likely to yield meaningful fruit over time.

2021-04-26 09:04:41,wallstreetbets,"Spread awareness about BB, it won't ""blast off"" like people expect it to for at least a year but trust in the process that will eventually let it reach the 300$ range at least in 5 years, you know, like a normal stock.

2021-04-26 16:02:02,wallstreetbets,"100 @ 19. Those bag got heavy QUICK.

Can't even sell a CC above my cost because comission is bigger than contract value or doesn't even exist."
2021-04-26 08:36:53,wallstreetbets,"Bless your souls, bag holders. Stay strong- it won’t surprise me if we see these prices again on GME squeeze.

That said, I’m holding BB for the long haul."

2021-04-26 13:53:13,wallstreetbets,What am I? a Native American ?
2021-04-26 08:55:06,wallstreetbets,"Haha, yep.  That’s how I ended up with 1000 @ 12.  Just put it on a shelf and let it marinate. Check back in a couple of years."
2021-04-26 08:49:22,wallstreetbets,What's your expiration on those?
2021-04-26 17:42:00,wallstreetbets,This is the way.

2021-04-26 17:36:44,wallstreetbets,you might be a thousandaire by June.. not a millionaire.
2021-04-26 09:11:52,wallstreetbets,damn he spent hella typing minutes writing that. tough crowd. didnt have to add the T and F in
2021-04-26 09:29:08,wallstreetbets,So? If you are in for the long run there should be nothing to worry about
2021-04-26 08:41:43,wallstreetbets,Lmao!
2021-04-26 08:33:59,wallstreetbets,🤣 So true!
2021-04-26 13:11:31,wallstreetbets,You misspelled PLTR. Same sentiment for both companies lol.
2021-04-26 16:51:07,wallstreetbets,*random marketing pics in there make the post super legit
2021-04-26 08:48:23,wallstreetbets,"Patent sale happens, big investors go “well there goes their revenue streams”.....price drops. That’s my expectation so that I can be surprised. I got burned for about $10k on 2/19 and 3/19 calls I held too long after the restrictions and trading halt. Im just buying shares and have some $9.50, $10, and $11 calls for January 2022. I’m not touching and short term options for this stock, not in its current phase."
2021-04-26 09:30:22,wallstreetbets,Patent sales would likely drop the price.
2021-04-26 08:29:15,wallstreetbets,An apes ape right her fellas!!
2021-04-26 07:21:37,wallstreetbets,I had to average down to 15 lol
2021-04-26 07:24:32,wallstreetbets,"I'm still holding mine at about the same lol, this is part of why. Then there's the fact that Blackberry and AWS are two of the most trusted entities of the US Gov, they pull this off and it will saturate that market too. BB is handling business."
2021-04-26 08:02:27,wallstreetbets,I think it would be a safer investment to buy actual black berry's
2021-04-26 12:16:29,wallstreetbets,"hear, hear"
2021-04-26 07:27:29,wallstreetbets,They just signed the AWS deal - What have you been hearing for years?
2021-04-26 09:44:28,wallstreetbets,"What is their distribution / adoption stream for yet another work comms software?  Even if it is amazing, how will they get ppl to drop slack or one of the dozen other similar pieces of office productivity tools out there?

I would wager such a tool would fail to get traction regardless of quality.

Don’t forget the BB10 tablet was actually pretty solid and ran on the first dev of the QNX OS for BB and face planted.

This company is known for grasping at its existing IP and channels in security, not growing market."

2021-04-26 15:36:21,wallstreetbets,"People love to act like warren buffet till it comes time to do warren buffet shit

The reason you’re a dogshit investor is because you’re trading based on price movements and not logical thesis’s. Buy when people are scared pussy"

2021-04-26 13:16:41,wallstreetbets,Which is why you buy LEAPS.
2021-04-26 09:31:10,wallstreetbets,100%
2021-04-26 08:13:27,wallstreetbets,"The BB partnership is different. AWS engineers are actually working with BB engineers on IVY, its not just BB using Amazon's cloud - Amazon is working on IVY.

Most of the partnerships you see are just companies using AWS cloud."
2021-04-26 07:53:50,wallstreetbets,Garbage collection. I see what you did there.
2021-04-26 09:46:06,wallstreetbets,You think BB will nearly 40x in 5 years? Not a chance lmao. Normal stocks do not go up 40x in 5 years.
2021-04-26 07:27:50,wallstreetbets,This is casino
2021-04-26 12:42:01,wallstreetbets,Haha right

2021-04-26 13:28:50,wallstreetbets,110 @ US$6
2021-04-26 19:08:25,wallstreetbets,"61 @ $15.23 average, might need to buy 8 more shares"

2021-04-26 10:33:38,wallstreetbets,"Bought at the peak, you have the best shares sir.  Get what you pay for I was always told"
2021-04-26 11:15:55,wallstreetbets,"Originally had 460 @ $26.41... ouch!  Averaged down a bit but had to sell off most to free up cash.  Still holding 150 but, it needs to run over $60 for me to break even overall."
2021-04-26 09:37:25,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your service.
2021-04-26 09:38:49,wallstreetbets,average down?

2021-04-26 15:38:10,wallstreetbets,its going to take a long ass time for it to happen imo
2021-04-26 09:24:33,wallstreetbets,What GME squeeze? Wake up man..
2021-04-26 09:19:35,wallstreetbets,"just avg down man, this is the way"

2021-04-26 12:08:39,wallstreetbets,Mine expire in June so im probably going to roll them out or at a minimum sell some calls against it. I want to buy a house next year.
2021-04-26 12:07:53,wallstreetbets,June. Ill probably roll most of them out.
2021-04-26 12:02:26,wallstreetbets,Why you hating? I don't hate on your Uber comments.

2021-04-26 15:04:08,wallstreetbets,Oops 😂
2021-04-26 10:10:46,wallstreetbets,JC clarified there is going to be a 7 year tail on the sale of patents. Not too shabby really.
2021-04-26 13:42:53,wallstreetbets,How much do you know about the patents? I got into a discussion with a guy (ModernBuddha1**)** about the value of them.
2021-04-26 08:23:34,wallstreetbets,Nokia 3310s all the way
2021-04-26 09:34:11,wallstreetbets,"And who do you think that benefits more?

AWS will slap a partnership on anything and enjoy the press and incoming $$ - pretty standard play for them in industry.  I wouldn’t read too much into it.

I’d personally be a little worried that BB is way too reliant on QNX, a small, low growth acquisition who has since found itself with much larger competitors."
2021-04-26 07:28:16,wallstreetbets,BB is a TuRnArOuNd PlaY
2021-04-26 15:54:42,wallstreetbets,"Lol, I’m bag holding BB for months now! Just like the rest...I don’t see any BB in Warrens portfolio!"
2021-04-26 08:41:10,wallstreetbets,"Okay, I see. It’s definitely not as generic as i guessed. Ivy will actually get a section in the AWS console, etc.

This is more like the VMWare partnership, which admittedly is keeping VMWare relevant in a big way."
2021-04-26 09:42:40,wallstreetbets,"No, this isn't true - AWS has an absolutely massive list of partnered companies.

[https://aws.amazon.com/partners/](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/)

They're not just AWS customers, it's companies using AWS products (for BB its the cloud, AI and ML products AWS offers) and AWS expertise to build solutions for customers.

BB isn't in a unique position. There are hundreds if not thousands of partners across many areas of business."
2021-04-26 09:39:42,wallstreetbets,"Lol that isn’t unique at all. I have been on heaps of cofounded or partnered AWS projects that included AWS dedicated devs and resources (same for Azure).

They’ll throw cash and bodies but you’re crazy if you think the goal isn’t to expand their service offerings to be compatible with car IoT, NOT BB specifically.  I mean on the front it’ll appear to be IVY but in reality it is designed agnostic under the hood.

AWS wants IoT because IoT is data rich and they found someone willing to take a run at it with them in this specific space.

BB needs the deal, AWS chose the deal because it benefits them long term regardless of BBs success.

It’s a vanilla presser that people are reading way too much into.

If you like this deal, I’d recommend investing in Amazon, not BB."
2021-04-26 10:05:33,wallstreetbets,I don't think you understand the value of data they are about to collect via IVY and other platforms nor the exclusivity they have in this space.
2021-04-26 10:12:36,wallstreetbets,Shit was not 7.50 early jan he’s bagholding and can’t do long terms

2021-04-26 10:37:36,wallstreetbets,i just bought 69 at 11 loonies
2021-04-26 12:39:28,wallstreetbets,Wish I had more money to average down :/. It's okay I'm a long term investor now

2021-04-26 12:38:53,wallstreetbets,7 year tail plus the initial lump would give them hella funds to put into ivy and building out products marketing and sales for consistent revenue increase overall.
2021-04-26 14:40:58,wallstreetbets,"They could determine a value based on future revenue taken to a present value discount. The question is how many years of revenue? 7? 10? How many patents? We don’t know, could easily be a $1B+ sale."
2021-04-26 08:47:20,wallstreetbets,They were talking about the stuff in the grocery stores.
2021-04-26 10:03:22,wallstreetbets,Yeah you're getting downvoted but completely right. Aws marketplace is analogous to the app store. There are hundreds of companies that sell products on aws. They need to start raking in more clients and building a moat.

There are plenty of companies with products that achieve the same purpose as what IVY is meant to achieve, and have been doing it for longer  Microsoft, Google, Otonomo - not to mention some OEMs like Tesla build their vehicle data platforms & analytics in house.

IVY won't ship in physical cars until 2023, whilst other players like Otonomo are already in cars - over 20mn, and that figure was from 2020.

When I realized I was bag holding I bought more to average down and also now I got an even 100 so I could sell an OTM call. I at least got something for it now, and I know it will go up someday. Doubt the call I wrote will execute and that’s fine by me. Its all a gamble but that’s why were here."
2021-04-26 14:41:47,wallstreetbets,I just keep adding and will be allll year. Love this company.

2021-04-26 13:03:54,wallstreetbets,"ouf. I should have averaged down, but I dumped a lot into mindmed"
2021-04-26 18:04:45,wallstreetbets,"lol 

GME went up 25% today. That's a fact, bro."
2021-04-26 15:20:45,wallstreetbets,$15B is absurd from the research I’ve done. They do like $1B a year in revenue currently 😂

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On March 23 the price of **SPY 6/18/21 $320** strike leap calls was **2.50**. Lets say we used $25k to buy 100 contracts and hold until expiration.

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the last price of **97.00** which gives us a total value of:

#$970,000

No TA and no DD needed. Invest in a boring index **on a dip** and you can secure your retirement.

1. **There is no news**
2. **There are over 600K shares available to borrow, in Fidelity alone, with only 0.75% interest rate**
3. **The volume is not even 15% of the free float**
4. **Open interest for puts expiring this Friday is 3.7 times larger than calls that means gamma squeeze is not even a remote probability.**

Let me tell you why, because they know you will buy far OTM calls the moment you see a 5-6% spike and then they will slowly bleed the SP in next trading days to kill those calls (and also puts). I said this long ago, this will keep repeating many more times.

Go ahead and start downvoting!"

I had some shares when it was around 10/11 just over a week ago. I noticed the quite high short interest and commented something about it saying it could squeeze soon or we could see a bunch of people hop on. However, it got downvotes a bunch, and after reading some bearish cases I sold 🤷‍♂️ I thought they’re probably worth $5 unless a buyout. 

Anyway, here I am. An idiot

2021-04-26 14:57:55,wallstreetbets,People need to seriously educate themselves on the stock. Big day is Thursday. Do DD.
2021-04-26 06:47:27,wallstreetbets,Those 4 seem trustworthy hence the due diligence
2021-04-26 09:16:12,wallstreetbets,Ew I accidently summoned a thetaganger. Someone get the broom!

2021-04-26 09:15:20,wallstreetbets,Always
2021-04-26 07:38:56,wallstreetbets,Right. This was known. WSB can’t claim this one.
2021-04-26 08:05:48,wallstreetbets,And I wouldnt expect anything less
2021-04-26 08:38:11,wallstreetbets,I threw 40k down the toilet in 10 minutes my first options play lol
2021-04-26 08:38:06,wallstreetbets,Yours was only 1.5k? Lucky
2021-04-26 16:28:49,wallstreetbets,"Well that is what I like to call, pain"
2021-04-26 15:17:03,wallstreetbets,"Remeber, you didn’t make shit unless you sold. Congrats either way."
2021-04-26 07:35:20,wallstreetbets,"I’m on your team G, I get cautious when WSB is hyping an already mooning stock, track record isn’t that great."
2021-04-26 08:06:04,wallstreetbets,Can they support the weight of a hefty adult? I’m looking for a new indoor swing.
2021-04-26 13:15:44,wallstreetbets,Peak retardation lol
2021-04-26 13:17:27,wallstreetbets,When you lose money but gain internet fame
2021-04-26 13:33:16,wallstreetbets,18mins? TSLA 0DTE ITM. Try 18 seconds
2021-04-26 13:33:52,wallstreetbets,I have lost that much in 18 seconds tbh
2021-04-26 13:39:16,wallstreetbets,"18 mins? 

I lost that in a tick last thursday."
2021-04-26 13:41:11,wallstreetbets,I get it guys we’re all really good at losing money in a short period of time I was mostly playing on the months -> mins being similar words bc that’s how my smooth brain works.
2021-04-26 08:11:33,wallstreetbets,"This dude talking to himself, bullish for shroom meds."
2021-04-26 09:21:51,wallstreetbets,"Be one with the flow, my friend"
2021-04-26 07:02:20,wallstreetbets,then you missed the day a couple weeks ago when it went up almost 20% after open before closing at like -15%
2021-04-26 06:46:50,wallstreetbets,90% from Monday. Bag holders gonna be pissed once it tanks EOW
2021-04-26 08:21:56,wallstreetbets,Same. Like an actual primitive SAVAGE. I was so close to putting in a couple grand this past weekend when it was around 13/14 and then again at 17/18 but my bitchass pussied out. Now it’s probably gonna be like 22/23 by the time market opens up but FUCK IT BITCH LESGO
2021-04-26 07:31:40,wallstreetbets,"Up +100% MVIS two days on zero verifiable news, should I still FOMO in?"
2021-04-26 07:52:16,wallstreetbets,"I would hazard a guess that new members during the GME runup can be divided into two camps: one that got burned and will soon stop investing, and others that learned a lot in the process and redoubled their efforts to learn more and not get burned again.  Not sure what the distribution is.  I'm definitely in the latter camp."
2021-04-26 07:31:02,wallstreetbets,"Quick version with some keywords and the basics:

- Company has been around for 20 years and has never made money, yes. That’s 20 years of research and development on MEMS scanning which has never been a profitable venture. That is changing as the technology is becoming scalable and has actual applications and emerging markets that include “holographic” near eye displays and automotive LiDAR.

- The company made a secret deal with MSFT in 2017 to have two of their parts power the Hololens 2. Commercial HL2 shipped with these two parts, so it is highly likely those parts are also in the IVAS system that just won a 22B Army contract. MVIS gets royalties from MSFT but it is unclear how the deal might differ for IVAS. 

-  CEO stated that this month MVIS would complete a LiDAR module that outperforms the current competition in the field and could significantly advance the autonomous vehicle LiDAR space. Earnings was just announced for April 29 and investors believe that this is confirmation of the good news. CEO believes production will start in Q3 or Q4."
2021-04-26 10:41:20,wallstreetbets,He's a trillionaire?!? 😮
2021-04-26 07:46:22,wallstreetbets,Thanks Wendy
2021-04-26 08:21:39,wallstreetbets,Before a potential BO I’d say around $28
2021-04-26 08:14:55,wallstreetbets,"To the mooon no fuckinggg stop so maybe 50,100 or 120 WHO tf know hold hold hold motherfuckers"
2021-04-26 08:11:48,wallstreetbets,I'm not sure because I'm retarded
2021-04-26 07:20:52,wallstreetbets,Fridays dip almost took 4 hours. Could be similar. I bought at the top of the peak Friday. And I’m up 15% pre market haha.
2021-04-26 07:22:49,wallstreetbets,No ones gunna be bag holding if they buy today. 🤔 💯
2021-04-26 10:41:56,wallstreetbets,"Yeah.  Saw trip-digit percent profit, couldn't turn it down.  Gotta make up my losses on CLOV :p  DFV I am not"

2021-04-26 11:50:27,wallstreetbets,"You buy the coke, you make crack silly. 

Noobs these days..."
2021-04-26 16:43:10,wallstreetbets,Not really all good news. They were only profitable since they sell their regulatory credits to other auto manufacturers. Over time all those companies are making their own EVs so they'll be buying less from companies like Tesla
2021-04-26 07:06:28,wallstreetbets,"I’m already playing apple, just wondering what other people are doing"
2021-04-26 11:58:11,wallstreetbets,Money back guarantee?
2021-04-26 13:52:03,wallstreetbets,That actually sounds good tbh
2021-04-26 07:38:13,wallstreetbets,They don't want to hear it here. I already tried 😅
2021-04-26 13:18:05,wallstreetbets,"Well done autist, well done!"
2021-04-26 06:24:14,wallstreetbets,Are you saying I should buy TSLA calls at open?
2021-04-26 10:14:40,wallstreetbets,Already reeling over not getting in on Friday like I had initially planned. I’ll take the pain at this point.
2021-04-26 11:34:57,wallstreetbets,God wills it
2021-04-26 12:48:48,wallstreetbets,"if it hits 800, its back in style"

2021-04-26 14:59:33,wallstreetbets,micro pp convention
2021-04-26 08:41:50,wallstreetbets,Lmfao why would your first play involve more than 40k
2021-04-26 08:39:39,wallstreetbets,2k for me so far and MVIS is the only play I haven’t fucked up...yet
2021-04-26 07:04:02,wallstreetbets,-15% for the whole day?
2021-04-26 08:23:11,wallstreetbets,It iz what it iz i can see that 28$ minumum untill friyay.
2021-04-26 07:39:15,wallstreetbets,Can’t go tits up. Make sure you save money to buy more on X day when I plan to sell!
2021-04-26 07:48:42,wallstreetbets,No problemo Mr Hwang
2021-04-26 07:13:49,wallstreetbets,"yea, I'm too lazy to look it up right now but it was maybe a couple weeks ago, closed somewhere between 10-15%. This is more dramatic than usual but those sorts of days aren't that uncommon"
2021-04-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,HUYA and DOYU YOLO update 2021/4/23 
2021-04-26 11:11:59,wallstreetbets,impressive dude. still can't decide if i want to pull the trigger on DOYU. I bought more calls on HUYA today. I'm in HUYA for 100k now
2021-04-26 06:07:16,wallstreetbets,"Options liquidity is pretty rough, but I'm looking at an entry"
2021-04-26 06:34:58,wallstreetbets,"Holy!

Best of lucks, may the seas of green crayons be with you"
2021-04-26 07:18:57,wallstreetbets,"I need douyu to go below $10 again so I can finish accumulating 10,000 shares. Once the merger is done, this will be the most undervalued company in the market."
2021-04-26 06:00:19,wallstreetbets,Good luck my dear friend!
2021-04-26 07:35:11,wallstreetbets,"You are not alone my Friend, $DOYU only here tho."
2021-04-26 08:32:00,wallstreetbets,Interesting companies to keep watching!!
2021-04-26 08:43:50,wallstreetbets,Dang. Im convinced this is a good play but i dont have the balls to do it like this. Worste case senario you own two good companys in a thriving market
2021-04-26 17:09:22,wallstreetbets,I'm balls deep in Huya only also and thinking about getting some douyu. I've been in for a long time and this is one of the most frustrating stocks to own even though the company itself feels like one of the most undervalued on the market. The biggest thing I can't understand is the short interest. It just seems like pure manipulation considering the price movement this thing went through the last couple of years.
2021-04-26 11:12:39,wallstreetbets,yea spreads are big. It'll get more liquid one it starts running. spreads get big when its consolidating
2021-04-26 07:31:40,wallstreetbets,Who are they merging?
2021-04-26 10:30:35,wallstreetbets,When are they due to merge?
2021-04-26 17:57:29,wallstreetbets,It’s all about the merger arbitrage. I have 2 good DD posts on this. Highly recommend the read. Free great research and explanation
2021-04-26 07:34:18,wallstreetbets,"Huya,  
Tencent is Backing it, they will own 80% of streaming in China.   


Needs to get approved."
2021-04-26 07:36:52,wallstreetbets,"Huya and douyu merging, big arbitrage opportunity if China allows it to go through, 0.73 shares of Huya per Douyu share."
2021-04-26 10:45:22,wallstreetbets,"Some time in q2, so within 3 months there should be a decision by the Chinese regulators."
2021-04-26 10:54:31,wallstreetbets,"Why is the gap between the price of Doyu and so big? 

28% discount in case the deal isn't going to survive?"
2021-04-26 11:04:39,wallstreetbets,"Yes, there are doubts that the deal will go through. Tencent owns a large stake in both companies and is the architect of this deal. China is cracking down on monopolies and this deal would give Huya 80% market share in game streaming. Rumor is that China wants Tencent to at least give up exclusive streaming rights to their games like League Of Legends. I think Tencent will end up making whatever concessions it has to in order to make the deal work."
2021-04-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,MVIS - been on the mvis Yolo game for a while with my 💎HANDs. Don’t miss out on this trip to the moon. I LOVE this Stonk!

2021-04-26 06:59:25,wallstreetbets,Do the hedge funds really think they can just say some words that we like and call a scam a stonk and then we’ll buy it?? That isn’t even the definition of a stonk or diamond hands lol
2021-04-26 08:22:56,wallstreetbets,$GME better
2021-04-26 01:06:40,wallstreetbets,"You sir, have diamond hands 🙌 awesome entry as well. Congrats 🎉"

But i do have 5K in play money saved up. and every part of me is not letting me allow myself to put it in RH."

2021-04-26 09:43:09,wallstreetbets,This stonk has got me nervous of a crash. It’s about to hit a new 52 week high!

2021-04-26 10:02:41,wallstreetbets,fuck
2021-04-26 10:02:59,wallstreetbets,Help a brother out and keep this above $23 as i am blocked and cant sell until tomorrow. I hate this cashapp investing because they limit you to day trades in a rolling 5 day period.
2021-04-26 10:08:07,wallstreetbets,Now liquidate that other 34.76% and put it in as well. Be a true ape.

2021-04-26 10:38:21,wallstreetbets,Does it still makes sense to buy options given it's too high now?
2021-04-26 10:51:11,wallstreetbets,"Thank you guys, I just sold at 120% gain"
2021-04-26 11:18:55,wallstreetbets,Had 100 shares at 1.40$ months ago and sold cause I needed to pay some bills. I knew I was gonna regret it
2021-04-26 11:26:43,wallstreetbets,What whale sold?
2021-04-26 11:34:36,wallstreetbets,Nice avg congrats
2021-04-26 11:45:18,wallstreetbets,What's your exit strategy?
2021-04-26 11:59:03,wallstreetbets,when did you buy ???
2021-04-26 12:11:38,wallstreetbets,Is it projected to go up? Or do u think it will? I sold mine at $14 cuz I don’t know anything bout it
2021-04-26 12:26:11,wallstreetbets,How much farther do you think it can go
2021-04-26 12:30:15,wallstreetbets,Stock was super volatile before WSB took notice. You could ride the options weekly up. I’ve been doing options on it for a few months now and it’s a winner. Now with WSB taking notice it’s going to rocket
2021-04-26 13:31:49,wallstreetbets,Threw some on kync today
2021-04-26 13:49:33,wallstreetbets,"Annoyed my trading apps don’t have this on. I’ve got a proper dealing account but I’ve never set it up for trading US stonks. 

Looks like I’ve missed the boat 😢"

2021-04-26 01:59:29,wallstreetbets,How soon can we expect a squeeze?
2021-04-26 01:42:34,wallstreetbets,What do we think the stock can hit???
2021-04-26 02:07:33,wallstreetbets,I’d Take my profits and dump it on WRHLF. Hoping that is the next run
2021-04-26 10:17:56,wallstreetbets,Amc going up 🙌💎🚀😆
2021-04-26 01:45:44,wallstreetbets,Too late to get in?
2021-04-26 01:46:20,wallstreetbets,Is it too late for tendies?
2021-04-26 07:55:21,wallstreetbets,What's this topping out at today??
2021-04-26 08:16:02,wallstreetbets,Huge moves in this stock today! Jumping on the flight no doubt!
2021-04-26 09:06:44,wallstreetbets,Wsb is healing
2021-04-26 10:05:58,wallstreetbets,Nice gains. Personally I’m not gonna chase this one. Hate that I missed the run lol
2021-04-26 11:48:34,wallstreetbets,Ouch !! That is super risky
2021-04-26 01:07:17,wallstreetbets,I 100% agree with you!!!
2021-04-26 11:34:38,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-04-26 09:50:47,wallstreetbets,"Now it's +27%, he's closer to +$50,000 on the day now"

2021-04-26 08:26:30,wallstreetbets,Should I buy calls for 30 or just buy shares?
2021-04-26 13:34:18,wallstreetbets,"we hittin resistance, i want a new ATH"
2021-04-26 01:17:43,wallstreetbets,I see what you did there Jeffrey Epstein
2021-04-26 06:28:48,wallstreetbets,No🧊🧊 noiceeeeeeeee
2021-04-26 10:06:39,wallstreetbets,That sweet 2.5% margin interest rate has OP hooked.
2021-04-26 09:43:15,wallstreetbets,"Tomorrow you will come with same thoughts, if $30 will be 40 if $40 will be 50. Will see you tomorrow 🤘 MVIS to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀"
2021-04-26 06:58:28,wallstreetbets,"I'm another long. 

That hold from 23 to 10 wasn't too hard when you believe in the company. Amazing tech."
2021-04-26 02:17:35,wallstreetbets,Any comments saying they own shares were also made the same week his account was made its so obvious
2021-04-26 08:34:48,wallstreetbets,"Not really? Tons of YOLOs are posted by accounts like that. Even RoaringKitty made a new account for his YOLO posts...

I think it's pretty normal for people to not want to associate their accounts with large sums of money."
2021-04-26 06:40:33,wallstreetbets,Also the articles being pushed out don’t call this a “meme stock” pretty strange if you ask me
2021-04-26 01:45:06,wallstreetbets,Don’t be scurred of my tested Diamond hands!
2021-04-26 07:33:27,wallstreetbets,I noticed a little bit of that myself
2021-04-26 05:54:54,wallstreetbets,I own calls and shares. Similar avg cost as OP.
2021-04-26 07:43:30,wallstreetbets,You all sound the same 😂
2021-04-26 19:31:53,wallstreetbets,Lol they are so obviously fake. Loads of the replies to this too. You can tell they're just kinda basic and cringe.
2021-04-26 04:52:55,wallstreetbets,Well for me MVIS is the reason I wanted to even create a reddit account. Reading the subs for years but the MVIS subreddit and wanting to be a part of it is what finally made me make an account.
2021-04-26 06:19:37,wallstreetbets,I share calls
2021-04-26 06:43:06,wallstreetbets,whats funny? they wanna make money and be a part of something.
2021-04-26 05:00:53,wallstreetbets,I own shares.
2021-04-26 16:01:18,wallstreetbets,I’m here with my 78@22.  Up $361 so far 😘
2021-04-26 05:07:38,wallstreetbets,I own calls
2021-04-26 08:35:52,wallstreetbets,I own shares.
2021-04-26 10:07:41,wallstreetbets,"I'll put it this way, I'm still holding my shares because I believe the stock is just getting started. If I at felt like this was the peak, I would be selling off. So if someone ask me if it's a buy, I say yes. If the answer was no, I'd be out myself."
2021-04-26 05:06:25,wallstreetbets,Not late at all! Bear in mind this stock has a target price of $120 in the next few years!
2021-04-26 07:52:40,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-04-26 04:55:49,wallstreetbets,No
2021-04-26 09:30:59,wallstreetbets,"It's still going to rise over the next 3 months, so no it's not too late."
2021-04-26 04:12:53,wallstreetbets,It was $0.25 just 12 months ago
2021-04-26 04:23:47,wallstreetbets,That’s how a P&D works.
2021-04-26 01:02:07,wallstreetbets,Holding for 30+ before I sell any.   Not worried about the dips.
2021-04-26 02:35:17,wallstreetbets,"Diamond hands are for profit???   I thought diamond hands are for never letting go.    Like me and all my 🦍 in GME BB and AMC. 

🚀🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌.🍌🍌🍌.🍌 💎🤚"
2021-04-26 01:45:35,wallstreetbets,I feel the same way. New account and a another “Diamond hand to the moon yolo” interesting
2021-04-26 03:36:30,wallstreetbets,"I purchased 1000 shares on Friday.

The only thing you’re on to is other users getting tendies.
Sincerely,
The resident GME and BB BAGHOLDER"
2021-04-26 02:07:12,wallstreetbets,i feel you but he’s commented on posts before i’m the same way i don’t post much or comment much but it’s annoyed when you get taken for a bot or a boost account
2021-04-26 11:21:11,wallstreetbets,Us long-term holders do exist. I posted about MVIS on WSB a few years ago and have 15k shares @ 0.90. Check my post history.
2021-04-26 02:00:20,wallstreetbets,100% it’s fake.  Made it all up.  Been making it up since MVIS was at $1.
2021-04-26 08:33:02,wallstreetbets,"Previous high around $20 not that long ago. No one really knows, but don't let fomo control you."
2021-04-26 06:43:55,wallstreetbets,"When I got in last week, my price target was 20 for this week. Anything less than 20 is safe for me. I'm putting in more because of the hype. If it goes sideways, worst case scenario, I wait a few months to get my money back since this goes to 10-19 and vice versa in like a month lol. But I will most likely just break even if this goes sideways."
2021-04-26 01:08:12,wallstreetbets,Was GME 70 to late? Not advise ofc.
2021-04-26 06:09:16,wallstreetbets,Go to mvis subreddit read the DD then decide for yourself. Gme is completely different situation coz this ain’t about a squeeze. Mvis should still be rising in the next weeks
2021-04-26 03:41:53,wallstreetbets,"Probably, yes. Save your money for the next go around."
2021-04-26 01:05:49,wallstreetbets,yes
2021-04-26 04:54:49,wallstreetbets,"Buy now you won’t miss out on MVIS, it hasn’t started yet in my opinion"
2021-04-26 09:50:56,wallstreetbets,I saw the DD on Thursday on this sub and bought in at 13.15. Then it dipped to 12.85 and thought I should have waited. I knew the company was a great buy and my target is hold until $30+ but I didn't think I'd almost double my investment in a couple days. Lets go MVIS!
2021-04-26 01:57:33,wallstreetbets,I’m new to this thread and a broke college student but kind of want to yolo this one. Do you think it’s too late at current price/ too risky 🥶
2021-04-26 01:57:16,wallstreetbets,That’s been the plan since I first got in.
2021-04-26 08:09:06,wallstreetbets,I always ask the same thing. Learning about tracking these down early is the goal.
2021-04-26 12:39:49,wallstreetbets,"Me too, bought 750, 50 for me, 700 for covered calls, its looking like a good day"
2021-04-26 15:57:39,wallstreetbets,"You know you can sell GME, right? You could use the money to buy this one, make profit, sell, and then buy even more GME later. The MVIS thing will most likely end on Thursday anyway, while GME has low chances of squeezing this week, especially now that so many are focused on other stock."
2021-04-26 16:10:02,wallstreetbets,no
2021-04-26 10:08:42,wallstreetbets,We all hold 🤘🤘🤘
2021-04-26 08:36:29,wallstreetbets,Yeah you’re not invited to the ape party now
2021-04-26 07:54:29,wallstreetbets,"RemindMe! 1 week ""tears"""
2021-04-26 07:42:50,wallstreetbets,They even got another chance to sell at $250 plus about a month after the squeeze. GME is a religion though so we'll be hearing about it for time to come.
2021-04-26 15:48:03,wallstreetbets,"You guys need to start taking your heads out of your on butts ... Being an ape is fine, but don't become a monkey... selling all my GME to buy this stock was the best option ... I am actually slapping myself, because I had my reddit closed for few days, and discovered this just Friday... even so, at this moment I am 68% up. Compare that with the last 2-3 weeks of limbo in GME... For the squeeze to happen GME needs to push above $360 or so, it won't reach that value this week, especially now that so many are focused on other and more profitable stock. For me a thing is sure thou, on Friday I will have way more money that I had on the last more Friday, and I would own more GME stock as a result."
2021-04-26 04:50:57,wallstreetbets,"Fuck no look at the pre market, the real run hasn’t even started yet if we continue to buy and hold"
2021-04-26 07:54:25,wallstreetbets,I also make stupid mistakes in life sometimes.
2021-04-26 15:52:49,wallstreetbets,"And I sold GME to buy MVIS ... GME doesn't go anywere, any time soon... so I can hold onto to this, sell it on Thursday and buy GME after ... the difference is that unlike with GME, I am actually making money this week ... GME didn't really deliver in the past 3 weeks."
2021-04-26 10:50:07,wallstreetbets,GME is ALWAYS a thing but diversification is not a bad idea.
2021-04-26 16:01:04,wallstreetbets,"It won't... RH intervened to stop what is essentially an artificial bubble, and prevent a devastating squeeze at the expense on WallStreet. This stock on the other hand, while helped by the popularity on WSB, is actually growing naturally. There is no squeeze, no conspiracy... is just good stock."
2021-04-26 02:15:05,wallstreetbets,Can you just do a proper TLDR
2021-04-26 11:40:54,wallstreetbets,Puts
2021-04-26 10:03:26,wallstreetbets,any suggestions on a better platform to trade on?
2021-04-26 12:45:43,wallstreetbets,"There is some really good DD in MVIS that is older and better explains what is happening. MVIS is going to likely be bought out by a mammoth company like microsoft and it is expected to payout more than the stock currently is per share. They also moved their earning report up to this week and many believe they will be releasing the results of their A-Sample testing, which would be big.

2021-04-26 01:08:45,wallstreetbets,"I just barely got in at 13.93

Unsure if it would be worth it to dump some
10k in at the current price of 17.97"
2021-04-26 11:35:29,wallstreetbets,My average cost is $12.95 at 1500 shares myself
2021-04-26 12:35:57,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, now I'm just wishing I had bought more. I only got in for 100 at $13.64. But oh well."
2021-04-26 09:56:55,wallstreetbets,Those figures require balls of steel. It's amazing he can walk whilst carrying those cannon ball nuts lol. I'm playing with 20k and no debt attached so I'm cool either way it goes

2021-04-26 02:18:42,wallstreetbets,Damn good looking. Funny how that is huh?
2021-04-26 07:00:52,wallstreetbets,I own shares.
2021-04-26 09:10:01,wallstreetbets,How is that sketchy? WSB received tons of publicity after GME. This is the next hot stock. How many new accounts were created just for GME?

2021-04-26 08:02:03,wallstreetbets,Imagine ruining yourself financially for a meme.
2021-04-26 08:48:00,wallstreetbets,why is this ape downvoted so hard? 🤨
2021-04-26 08:43:56,wallstreetbets,"It's funny you got downvoted, because 2 weeks ago you'd have been applauded.

I guess things are finally changing around here.

Good or bad, time will tell, but probably good."
2021-04-26 07:01:59,wallstreetbets,"Look at the mvis sub where there is a really solid amount of due diligence. My average will end up being in the low $15s. They moved up their earnings report but more importantly are likely to be purchased by a behemoth like Microsoft relatively soon (they are openly for sale)

Some folks here will sell if it hits 30, some won't. I dont know if I'd buy in at 20 because I'm an idiot, but this isn't a distraction stock like some people think."

2021-04-26 11:02:37,wallstreetbets,"Same here. Bought at 10ish and figured if it went up even a little, it's money. I'm not a to the moon investor but the stock yoyo's reasonably regularly so it's hard to lose if you get it at a good price."
2021-04-26 01:12:43,wallstreetbets,"No I actually bought GME at $320 and averaged down to $272 on dips but GME is a little different beast with all the shorts don’t you think?

2021-04-26 04:52:06,wallstreetbets,Is this shit like gme case? Short squeeze ?
2021-04-26 02:23:37,wallstreetbets,"No but here’s the rest of it since I see your reply as a glimmer of interest.        ......I still got 20K scattered in there *RH* that I want to take out!   The 5K cash stash and a desire (but procrastination) to open a Fidelity has been burning a seriously hole in my pocket!!! I’m busy enough at work to not die from fomo but DAMN. 

I do have a heavy E*TRADE portfolio.. but E*TRADE is for my long term investments since my smooth brain don’t know how to move anything around in that platform anyway. Lol.   Might wire the 5K there for MVIS 😂.        I don’t even know if E*TRADE even let you trade a stock twice in one day. Or if there’s a 5 trades per month “you don’t have a daytrader approval” limit.   Everything about E*TRADE has me lost af.     Well, that’s where my longs are. Bc I don’t know how to have my money bouncing around and screw myself like I do with WeBull and RH 😂.       

* * * * 

TLDR:  welcome to the world of an actual neurodivergent (autist).     It’s not all it’s hyped up to be.  

*edit* Q: can’t you just?   A: somewhat. —> “idk how one could trust RH with that much money. I can’t.”"

We touched up on stocks when I was in high school but I never really understood even though I was number one in school when it came to like investing in getting returns on it, it’s  weird I know but I just wanna know how to do it in real life"
2021-04-26 07:01:33,wallstreetbets,Shit... I’m not even in yet... spending $10k at open and I’m sure I’ll be at $20
2021-04-26 01:11:07,wallstreetbets,It’s a tough call to make.  It should run with all attention it’s getting because of the YOLO WSB plays.

2021-04-26 09:52:12,wallstreetbets,Hope you did
2021-04-26 14:25:33,wallstreetbets,Yeah I bought 70  5/21 $12 option contracts. Just trying to determine how long to hold out before the inevitable return to the support line.

2021-04-26 11:07:26,wallstreetbets,"If you buy the upgraded Robinhood gold, you get access to a margin where you can borrow money from RH to buy stocks. It used to be 5% interest, but this year they lowered it to 2.5%. The amount you can borrow is proportional to your equity (i.e. if you double the amount added to your account, you can borrow double as well). 

OP might only have only put $6k of their own money in the original purchase with the other $5k being borrowed. At least that's what I would have done."
2021-04-26 15:37:28,wallstreetbets,Stay mad at a brokerage instead of getting better at trading

2021-04-26 08:13:33,wallstreetbets,Do you have any reasoning why it might hit 100+ soon? Any news about them?
2021-04-26 09:18:12,wallstreetbets,How many first posts or comments were there about GME?
2021-04-26 10:13:06,wallstreetbets,"money is still being made, so..."
2021-04-26 02:21:16,wallstreetbets,Yeah.  First post.   Doesn’t mean it’s fake.
2021-04-26 08:48:50,wallstreetbets,"then don't throw a lot of money at it... let it dip at open, buy a 100 shares with a strict stop loss and set your SL higher and higher manually. even if you exit with $50 on your $2000, it's still a few % in a single day.

(Although to be fair, i'm recommending this but i dont intend to do it... meh maybe with a 100 shares. We'll see how deep it dips)"
2021-04-26 02:48:09,wallstreetbets,Like my checking will say 50 bucks for a few days if I dump 🤣🤣

2021-04-26 11:00:12,wallstreetbets,Rumors of talk with Microsoft and their tech
2021-04-26 08:18:03,wallstreetbets,"Yes! They have 20+ years of r&d leading them to have multiple verticals in game changing technology such as Augmented reality (powering the MSFT hololens 2) and Lidar for autonomous vehicles. They are set to announce the completion of the best in class Lidar which will most probably happen this Thursday at EC. And they have stated they are seeking to be bought out. A very realistic, middle of the road estimate of a buyout would be at 17billion for all their tech and intellectual property. This would send us around 102$"
2021-04-26 02:59:26,wallstreetbets,"check CLOV. Imagine being richer than fucking countries, would you buy bots if u were grabbed by the balls?"
2021-04-26 15:49:56,wallstreetbets,"Well, why does stock normally goes up? Because is valuable and peoples make it buy it."

2021-04-26 08:54:52,wallstreetbets,Okay...I’m bullish on MVIS and I have 1700 shares...but this is just ridiculous

Someone buy them please!"

2021-04-26 08:55:47,wallstreetbets,"How is this ridiculous? Luminar is only lidar, has shittier lidar and was valued around 7bil not long ago"
2021-04-26 17:20:02,wallstreetbets,Didn’t you know a bunch of other brokerages blocked to buy as well? Why are you hyper focused on RH
2021-04-26 19:08:17,wallstreetbets,"I see you removed your comment cuz you realized how wrong u are. Interactive brokers. WeBull. Bunch of others blocked buying GameStop. And no, it’s not because they felt like it."
2021-04-26 10:11:09,wallstreetbets,Besides a myriad of other reasons...You don’t pay the price of an Apple tree for the seeds. There’s still work to be done after a buyout. We’re years from that evaluation. The direction will look good depending on how the samples go most likely. Hopefully we get positive information on the 29th.
2021-04-26 19:11:14,wallstreetbets,I think a mod removed it. But whatever man idk wealthsimple trade didnt block anything
2021-04-26 10:50:51,wallstreetbets,"Well if the apple tree could produce trillions dollars worth of apples and you would have to get early into the apple business to establish a leading position, then you would be willing to spend billions to get the seed that will do that for you"
2021-04-26 11:46:16,wallstreetbets,Lol I appreciate your optimism. I also have some seeds I'd like to sell you so I can buy more MVIS shares.
2021-04-26 11:57:09,wallstreetbets,I think a lot of people underestimate the value of mvis. This is really at least two of the biggest innovative tech of the next decades that will change life and bring about soooooo much profits for the ones ahead. Companies dont simply have to plant a seed and we sell the seed like a farmer would and he could pick any fkn seed. These seeds are Bills Gates level GMO seeds that are patented and are a cumulation of 20+ years of straight development. The ground’s and the climate’s conditions are so harsh and complexe a seed farmer doesn’t even want to spend countless years to research a good seed. Because he knows other farmers are after the same tree that once grown allows you to dominate the future of all the hoomans in your village because all they had to eat so far are frog eggs and bugs

I'm now at 8 shares. But the growth is making me happy bc like... it feels like things are going right. AMC is up. MVIS is up. And thanks to this reddit, I feel like I can make better judgment calls on what to do with my spare money.

And that's gamble it away.

Seriously though, first victory I've had in a long time. I love all of you."

2021-04-26 02:37:38,wallstreetbets,Options are pretty pricey after the recent movement. What date are you guys buying?
2021-04-26 02:55:05,wallstreetbets,What would be the lowest expected price that it would increase to after the buyout?

2021-04-26 04:59:23,wallstreetbets,OMFG you fuckers are about to send this thing to Uranus.  I once owned 7k shares of it.  Should I sell my Gme and yolo on this one? I'm down $6k on GME
2021-04-26 05:38:10,wallstreetbets,Wow give me  $1.4m then I stop being a ass kisser here in South Africa. That is  20M South African Rand
2021-04-26 06:14:44,wallstreetbets,Honest question from someone who has no idea of what it is all about in MVIS: What is the hype all about?
2021-04-26 07:26:23,wallstreetbets,Let's Make the squeeze happen
2021-04-26 08:17:49,wallstreetbets,"Earnings are due on 28/4.

Don't stocks usually plummet on earnings even when they're good these days?

&#x200B;

Is it worth waiting to get in till after the earnings drop?"
2021-04-26 09:47:46,wallstreetbets,At this point some of these guys have too much money but that’s why we lose it
2021-04-26 09:54:01,wallstreetbets,Earning to Amc and GameStop 🙌💎🚀
2021-04-26 10:25:59,wallstreetbets,Amc 🙌💎🚀

2021-04-26 00:48:06,wallstreetbets,This is not the way.
2021-04-26 00:53:35,wallstreetbets,"The average cost is $17.97, with that much cash you should have sold thousands of in the money puts and waited for assignment. You would have lowered you average cost by hundred of thousands... And then sell covered calls."

2021-04-26 09:33:51,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't pay too much attention to that director's share count. He's only on the BoD because his family owns \~20 million shares.

2021-04-26 02:13:55,wallstreetbets,"i swear MVIS has gone from 11 to near (and at one point above) 20 and back down again multiple times. Ive been waiting since like January for the April announcement. This wasn't a run, its been this way for weeks. The real ""run"" is in a few days, from all this hype and the Thursday announcement"
2021-04-26 00:46:36,wallstreetbets,It’s called a trust fund

2021-04-26 10:36:34,wallstreetbets,Right behind you with 2 shares just for the fun 😂
2021-04-26 10:06:17,wallstreetbets,To Saturn!
2021-04-26 11:24:05,wallstreetbets,Also in for my 5 whole shares. I got in at 17.58 so I'm seeing a nice little return.
2021-04-26 00:57:11,wallstreetbets,I think you have more than enough time to get your cash back
2021-04-26 02:38:52,wallstreetbets,Brah I feel the same. I keep seeing post with hundred thousands and mills dropped! And I'm out here yelling Yolo with my spare hundred for the week
2021-04-26 00:46:00,wallstreetbets,It's amazing what you can find when you read lmao. Nice balls bro
2021-04-26 09:16:36,wallstreetbets,"Your averaged ""true value""  of 18 bil X $6.33 gives you a value of pps$117. That's a good place for the shorts to start at!!"
2021-04-26 03:58:42,wallstreetbets,How could you possibly end up at this conclusion? I'm actually interested in your thought process here.
2021-04-26 07:53:57,wallstreetbets,What makes you think that's the true value
2021-04-26 01:14:01,wallstreetbets,Yours will serve you well too!
2021-04-26 08:41:05,wallstreetbets,How high can it go?? 🤔
2021-04-26 16:06:28,wallstreetbets,Congrats 🍾

2021-04-26 00:46:54,wallstreetbets,**Bold is you**
2021-04-26 02:15:29,wallstreetbets,You are that bold to be one ☝️
2021-04-26 02:49:11,wallstreetbets,"If we Miss Out after experiencing the Fear Of Missing Out, we then know that Missing Out wasn’t something to have worried about to begin with.  Therefore, FOMO needn’t exist. 

Furthermore, if we don’t Miss Out, oftentimes we wish we had Missed Out due to unforeseen negative circumstances.  I propose that FONMO (Fear of Not Missing Out) is a more justifiable fear and should be elevated as the new standard of FOxO."
2021-04-26 02:06:49,wallstreetbets,I love it 👊🏽👊🏻👊🏽👊👊🏿
2021-04-26 00:11:32,wallstreetbets,Happy to meet someone else good at maths!
2021-04-26 17:54:31,wallstreetbets,If he had 1.4 milli to yolo at MVIS... I think he was already there
2021-04-26 01:03:56,wallstreetbets,"I'll post it there later..., just a loop of me hitting the ask"
2021-04-26 01:06:58,wallstreetbets,"Damn, I guess I'll start over"
2021-04-26 10:16:26,wallstreetbets,That's exactly how I feel. Could surge to 5000% and then drop below the start point the very second my trade goes in
2021-04-26 10:12:02,wallstreetbets,That's my hope!
2021-04-26 01:15:32,wallstreetbets,Thanks for this. The hype explains what is otherwise something to avoid based on what I see in their financials and what is called out here in section 1A Risk Factors of their most recent 10-K: [$MVIS Risk Factors](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/e1052d61-f7d2-4114-bb5e-fda0b4546f93)
2021-04-26 09:05:04,wallstreetbets,"Have put about $1,000 on MVIS with money that’s feels dicey to spend. I won’t be out on my ass if this fails but definitely will hurt. You aren’t the only retard don’t worry"
2021-04-26 00:43:34,wallstreetbets,"Not even close to the top bud. There's valuations anywhere from $30-120+ for the buyout, and the sale of a vertical might result in a one-time special dividend of $6.30ish per billion dollars of sale. In the case of a special dividend OR buyout, the number of shares held is the key profit driver. Not so much the share price"
2021-04-26 01:19:16,wallstreetbets,"Post history says he bought in December, so 2-4$ range is likely."
2021-04-26 00:47:48,wallstreetbets,I’ll give you the tip 🍆
2021-04-26 00:33:56,wallstreetbets,"It's still a strong play this week, but expect it to go fucking bonkers at a moments notice. Then it's gonna crash like GME. I think we exit the rapids around 20."
2021-04-26 09:47:22,wallstreetbets,Why you ask ? Don’t you see ? Relax and let’s MVIS to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-04-26 09:46:32,wallstreetbets,me too ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)

2021-04-26 08:35:29,wallstreetbets,"It's risky, and greatly depends.

A lot of this momentum is riding on a significant announcement beyond just earnings, whether it be partnerships, acquisition news, sample lidar etc. All of these things have decent  possibility of happening, so the only scenario its worth getting in is if they just report earnings and don't clarify any other factors. That would cause a dump IMO.  


PS I am in on MVIS"
2021-04-26 08:50:52,wallstreetbets,"This earnings will be great, msft payments and a lidar update that will blow the top off"

2021-04-26 00:55:49,wallstreetbets,"Sweetie, if you think that's my average you need to look at the picture again. This account only hold shares, I'm up to my elbows in calls, ii would not sell covered calls with a buyout looming.... Puts sure"
2021-04-25 23:56:27,wallstreetbets,Poor dude you got caught bag holding huh?
2021-04-26 07:55:31,wallstreetbets,"Bag holding? Most people are still holding. I see people mentioning dfv and this is the way on other stocks then gme and it makes me laugh. We will continue to hold and buy more until the end game is finished. Dfv doubled his position as most of us have done . If we wanted to sell out for a shit $400 a share and give hf a way out then what was the point. I am actually still deep deep in the money on my position and could sell out any time I want, but that’s not the way !"

2021-04-26 08:27:16,wallstreetbets,Unless the hype is already baked into the price and this is the run. I’m debating selling ahead of Thursday to lock in gains and look for another entry point... but realistically I’ll get greedy and it’ll drop and hit my stop.
2021-04-26 09:51:41,wallstreetbets,if you had to guess what do you think this will level out at? after a big spike?
2021-04-26 04:39:54,wallstreetbets,This is so true! The run up hasn’t started yet this is typical MVIS movement

I sold a few hundred at previous peaks just to recoup my initial investment. Just a note: this stock is very swingy. Hold on through it and it’ll get back up there if it does start to fall. MVIS is a rollercoaster. 

Who knows though, this is the first time in over a year I’ve seen such widespread interest (stocktwits, Reddit, etc.) and that means a lot."

My plan is to watch for the stock to top out friday, and do my best to sell that peak. Alternately the news is tragic, and I'm out at open.

I then just wait, profits secure, for what I think to be the bottom of the correction and have at it.

&#x200B;

So, in summary, I plan to make shit a lot more complicated because I'm retarded and high. Or maybe it works and I did something right for once in my miserable life. =D"

I started about 6 weeks ago, after GME ran its course. I've been putting everything I can into Fidelity, and found MVIS almost instantly. I didn't buy in as it was still on a peak and I could smell the FOMO in the DD I had seen, but I kept a close eye on it because I saw value. My taxes came in and I got my first 200 shares at 12 and change, and another 50 under 11.

I hadn't lost all my money gambling on RKT,  and when I saw MVIS under $11 with insane IV and no volume, I stayed up all night forming a thesis and fleshing my plan out. 

Monday I sold literally every stock I owned besides MVIS, and doubled down at 10.50, and posted my DD to WSB. 

All because I saw a decent DD on /new in here and made a note."

2021-04-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$TAP Miller-Coors: A company that has re-invented itself and wallstreet is sleeping Alright retards, here’s a DD that contains no technical analysis because if this company had good technical’s it wouldn’t be a sleeper. This is a social arbitrage DD. Also, I don't care about how many micro-brews you have in your town. Beer is somewhat irrelevant to this play.

Molson-Coors is no longer the piss beer coors brand that your drunk uncle remembers. It’s now a company that’s woken up from the dead with new leadership and rollout of fantastic products. They have focused on a completely new product lineup, that involves seltzers, energy drinks, THC beverage’s, and a ""beyond beer"" segment. Couple all these new products with the lockdowns ending globally and you are going to have a monster Q2/Q3 earnings report. Not to mention this stock is beat down so much from wall street it’s a asymmetric trade as it stands right now.

First off, wall street fucking hates this company and for good reason. The past 7 years they were stagnant and failed to adapt to new markets/trends. They took on billions of debt to purchase SABmiller. Another shit beer company that wasn’t doing shit. The beauty of this is that wall street is frozen and is going to be late to the party when they get smacked in the dick with earnings for Q2 and Q3 of this year. They have a wait and see attitude to towards this company and they will be forced to pile on once they see the results from the new products molson-coors has deployed.

To name a few:

* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer: Owned by coke but Molson- coors has exclusive manufacturing, distribution and marketing rights. This new seltzer is the hotness on the streets right now. It had a soft launch 3 weeks ago in 9 states and it already has over 3% of the seltzer market. Go out and pick some up(if its not sold out everywhere) and I promise you you’ll be throwing your life savings into this company on Monday morning.
* Zoa: New energy drink from the Rock. Who knows how this is going to sell but with the Rock pushing this to his tens of millions of social media followers, im sure it’ll do just fine. I've spoken to a health store(cant name it here because of the automods) rep who have said this is selling as well as redbull and monster.
* Light Sky: One of the best if not best light beers out there. Its blue moons light offering. Go check it out, it’s a crushable summer beer. Perhaps the best light beer on the market right now.
* Yuengling: Signed distribution rights to expand the company to the West Coast.
* Vizzy Hard Seltzer: Another new solid seltzer offering. Has vitamin-c and shit that all the crunchies like. Also has great taste and flavors.
* Coors Seltzer: Not sure who buys this but I heard its selling really well. Just glad the company has many different seltzer offerings now.
* Truss Beverage: THC infused beverage offering that’s killing it in Canada and has plans to expand to the US.
* [Beyond beer hub](https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2021/04/08/Molson-Coors-launches-Beverage-Hub-for-beyond-beer-beverages): This is super exciting. Molson-coors has been bleeding out the past 10 years because they failed to adapt to new and emerging markets. This endeavor will enable them to be on the cutting edge of any trend that is emerging. Just think, if this company got into seltzers when it was starting to materialize 4 years ago, the stock prices would be well over $100/share minimum. With this hub you can be sure that Molson-Coors will never miss an opportunity like that again.

The Selzer game is absolutely huge for this company. This is a main pillar of the company’s revitalization. The seltzer market is doubling every year and theres projections TAP will take a minimum of 10-15% of the market with Topo Chico and Vizzy alone. That is hundreds of millions to billions in revenue for a company that only has a 10B market cap. This can easily drive this stock price up by multiples.

Check out this quote from an insider: “Just talked with a 10 year brewer in Milwaukee with coors- moors, extremely bullish conversation overall. Coors seltzer is see high sell through, heard vizzy is selling well, he brews light sky and blue moon, said sell through has been amazing, told me the company acquired/did a deal with columbay(?) For a hard coffee drink, he raved about the sampler packs they got, and extremely good initial response from that, rolling that out soon but didn’t know timeline, he’s heard topo is flying, the whole company is buzzing, but didn’t know much beyond that. Said his factory laid 200 people off start of 2020, and have now hired back 350. He was extremely enthusiastic. Overall said in his ten years he’s never seen coors do so well. Very confident in management and direction”.

All of these solid new product additions coupled with the US coming out of lockdown and they are going to blow the tits off earnings Q2 and Q3. I expect the earnings call this week to be terrible for Q1 due to lockdowns and a cyber attack that stalled beverage production. Good time to jump in.

TLDR: Revitalized company with new leadership, fantastic new diverse product offerings coupled with ending lockdowns will be rocket fuel for this company. Q1 earnings will suck because of the lockdowns and cyber-attack disrupting production but Q2 and Q3 will blow the tits off wallstreet. In my opinion the Q1 report will give us all a solid price to buy in. $SAM 6X in 3 years and I expect similar performance or better here. The stock is so beaten down from the past 5 years it's a safe asymmetric play with incredible upside potential. Even Michael Burry owns this. But he'll probably sell out before it rockets like GameStop because he's a boomer.

My Position: 20 $47C Oct '21, 30 $70C Jan '22, and 769 Shares(Buying after earnings 5/29)"

2021-04-25 22:19:55,wallstreetbets,"Alcohol sales rep here: Seltzer/FMB (fermented malt beverage)  is the fastest growing segment in the alcohol industry. Marc Anthony Brands (private company) owns white claw, which accounts for over 58% of the total seltzer category. Second is Samuel Adams, which owns Truly, which accounts for roughly 21% of all seltzer. Third is Anheuser-Busch with Bud light Seltzer, making up about 8%. Miller coors does not even crack the top 3 products in the fastest growing segment. $SAM has been smashing earnings, and if white claw is the ""coca cola""/first brand that comes to mind, then Truly is the Pepsi of the seltzer market. I'd recommend playing $SAM over miller coors.

2021-04-26 00:58:08,wallstreetbets,You forgot the part where they also have white claw. And being a previous beer merchandiser for budweiser. They are losing the aluminum race since Busch has controlling interest in an aluminum mill. They are only losing money right now due to shortages. Their shelves can barely get filled. Soon as they fix that problem the stock will rise.
2021-04-26 19:48:39,wallstreetbets,"Here's the thing though, most of the distribution of vizzy and topo chico seltzer is leveraged through white claw and Truly. For example, Allied Beverages in Los Angeles distributes Truly, White Claw, Vizzy, Topo Seltzer, and Coors Seltzer. The ONLY reason Vizzy and these other brands are even on the shelves is through the leverage of truly and white claw. And do you know what happens when those garbage products expire? They get picked up for a full refund in accordance to ABC laws. So on paper, it will say ""X # of cases sold in 30 days, look how big this product launched"", which usually occurs due to incentives for reps to get distribution. Fast forward 90 days and half of that stuff gets picked up as credit, falls off distribution, and never sees the light of day again. If you run a market share report within 90 days of a brand launch like Topo Chico it will show that it has taken share, but zoom out to an 180 day or one year report and most of that stuff doesn't even dent the market share of the top 3 seltzer brands."

2021-04-25 22:13:39,wallstreetbets,"Sure I’ll do one right now:

Del Taco is gross. It’s a shittier Taco Bell found in random towns across middle America. The only Del Taco I’ve had the displeasure of eating at was during a visit to Grand Junction, CO. I left not only not satiated but can also remember thinking I wouldn’t feed Del Taco to my dog."

2021-04-26 08:05:28,wallstreetbets,Playing SAM is completely missing this trade. SAM is safe but it will not have the gains you’ll see with TAP. The TAP play is about an unexpected comeback with a stock that is beaten down to nothing. Follow Topo Chico/vizzy market share over the next couple of months compared to White Claw. That will be your gauge on this trade.
2021-04-26 10:39:52,wallstreetbets,Fellow booze hawker here. Agree with everything you said. This is just Molson Coors chasing trends that have been established for a few years already. What here is game changing? Nada. Just a few more sku's muddying up store shelves. Plus I'll die on this hill - nobody gives a rats ass about THC beverages. They take too long to kick in and it's not the same as throwing back a few cold ones after a game. The future of Cannabis is vape pens and edibles.
2021-04-26 08:20:52,wallstreetbets,I work for an ab distributor and not a chance in hell I would touch that stock.
2021-04-25 22:12:25,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, seltzers are the most overcrowded slice of the beverage market. I expect this crap to be collecting dust at the bottom of the rack in no time."
2021-04-26 00:10:14,wallstreetbets,"I've never seen anyone drink anything other than truly or whiteclaw.    If it's something different like bud light seltzer it's usually a one off for the novelty.  

This is definitely an observation and not based on personal use, as I've never heard of any drinks listed."

2021-04-25 22:34:00,wallstreetbets,"uh yeah... TAP can’t even get retailers in stock, and not because of demand but because their supply chain is trash. Every brewer and their wife’s boyfriend is getting into seltzer’s it’s not a differentiator and there’s no reason to think they’ll take meaningful share. BUD much better positioned and probably going to have a CEO change soon which is overdue and will be a catalyst when they get someone who can drive organic growth"
2021-04-25 22:02:54,wallstreetbets,It’s called diversification.
2021-04-26 07:54:56,wallstreetbets,Wrong. You don’t understand the play if you think that. The whole premise of the play is this is a beaten down shitty company that is making a massive comeback and people aren’t going to realize it until Q2 and Q3 earnings. BUD is already a well respected established brand so it won’t have the same price volatility as TAP.
2021-04-25 22:42:40,wallstreetbets,"Haven’t dug into it, but how the fuck is an ancient beer company not profitable? You have low overhead and sell fermented rice/corn for 4x the price of Coke. Everyone was at home drinking all year."

2021-04-26 07:48:40,wallstreetbets,My price target is minimum $80 after Q3 earnings. Once they reinstate the dividend and blow away Q2 and Q3 we should be closer to the industry average of 26x earnings
2021-04-26 07:57:21,wallstreetbets,Hold your shares until November. You won’t regret It.
2021-04-26 07:56:42,wallstreetbets,Exactly. I foresee coke and TAP doing a lot of business in the future
2021-04-26 04:01:10,wallstreetbets,"TAP is an exclusive  distributor for Zoa, unclear how lucrative the deal is"
2021-04-26 07:45:08,wallstreetbets,How could it be priced in when the stock is trading at 12x earnings and the industry average is 26x?
2021-04-26 10:12:45,wallstreetbets,"Good, we are at the bottom. Makes me even more bullish."

2021-04-26 12:27:15,wallstreetbets,Dividend is coming back soon. Hold until November. Competitors are trading at a much higher PE than this. It’ll rocket if it does half as well as I expect

2021-04-25 22:39:23,wallstreetbets,Shittier Taco Bell?   Not possible.  Apparently the single random Del Tacos across middle America and the East do not represent the best the brand can be.  Poorly executed franchise model...perhaps.  But visit a store in CA or AZ and there is no way you say a shittier Taco Bell.  Everything is better from the cheese to the produce to the meat to the sauces.

2021-04-26 09:00:45,wallstreetbets,When this man says “dah bomb” I think he is referring to the fact Del Taco may be a covert terrorist organization since ingesting their food may in fact terrorize your asshole as eruptive diarrhea forcefully explodes from it shortly after consuming.

2021-04-26 17:29:05,wallstreetbets,Claw's the law baby
2021-04-26 19:47:11,wallstreetbets,"Here's the thing though, most of the distribution of vizzy and topo chico seltzer is leveraged through white claw and Truly. For example, Allied Beverages in Los Angeles distributes Truly, White Claw, Vizzy, Topo Seltzer, and Coors Seltzer. The ONLY reason Vizzy and these other brands are even on the shelves is through the leverage of truly and white claw. And do you know what happens when those garbage products expire? They get picked up for a full refund in accordance to ABC laws. So on paper, it will say ""X # of cases sold in 30 days, look how big this product launched"", which usually occurs due to incentives for reps to get distribution. Fast forward 90 days and half of that stuff gets picked up as credit, falls off distribution, and never sees the light of day again. If you run a market share report within 90 days of a brand launch like Topo Chico it will show that it has taken share, but zoom out to an 180 day or one year report and most of that stuff doesn't even dent the market share of the top 3 seltzer brands."
2021-04-26 09:27:36,wallstreetbets,"In my area, Miller Coors is the distributor for Sam Adams.

I think there's a possibility that whatever deal they have with Sam has already been priced in since Sam has been rocking 1k a share for a few months."
2021-04-26 10:55:46,wallstreetbets,"As someone who was a bartender for around ten years prior to Covid... these are the only Molson-Coors products I've ever seen anyone express an interest in: Blue Moon, Crispin Cider, Killians Irish Red, Fosters, Leinenkugel, Terrapin, and Yuengling (I'm in PA). I do think that Topo-Chico's seltzer could be a hit, but it looks like most of their (Molson-Coors) products have grown out of favor with the general populace and I'm not seeing enough marketing or interest for that to change anytime soon."
2021-04-26 15:48:24,wallstreetbets,"Once everyone starts getting out again & walking off those LBS you will want a Real BEER 5% or above!

I can confidently say that he also loved the taste of del Taco.

2021-04-26 19:53:28,wallstreetbets,All indications show Topo Chico being a hit but you’re right. The big risk is sustained demand. If Topo Chico takes a sliver out of white claw and trulys market share then it’s a massive success. If Topo Chico dies off and can’t keep fridge space then I’ll look to sell off.
2021-04-26 09:31:18,wallstreetbets,I dont think its priced in solely based on t he PE. SAM is 56 and TAP is 13. This makes me even more bullish that TAP has tons of room to run.

But the one thing everyone gets wrong with MVIS is that their LiDar tech is much smaller than the rest of the markets which allows car makers to use them and not have it look unappealing to the consumers. Plus MVIS is doing much work to make their LiDar at a much lowers cost which is key especially for the average car instead of the higher end cars. This will allow auto makers to catch up to the autonomous software used in the higher end cars without the automakers having to invest a lot of time and money. Then there is their Augmented reality which is gonna be huge in the years to come. We all know the hololens 2 made from Microsoft that  uses  Microvision Tech in the augmented lenses. However it seems a lot of people overlook the use of augmented reality into today's society. Hello pandemic goodbye big business conferences, meetups, face to face interactions. Here comes augmented reality to still be in the same room and looking at the same material and be able to interact with the people and material. Future of construction, construction workers can work on the physical site with an augmented layout of what they are working on and be able to interact with that blueprint right at the sight. How this will save so MUCH MONEY AND TIME for construction. Hello Biden administration massive infrastructure plan over the next 10 years. How about training new employees. There are many people looking for jobs and many companies hiring (today's issues of hiring isn't not enough jobs but not enough qualified people for those jobs). So how do we get those people hired and trained quickly to be able to keep up? Augmented reality! A much more fast and cost efficient way to get that on job experience. This can be applied to mechanics, healthcare workers, construction workers, many sales & marketing, field service, farming, architecture. The uses of MicroVision tech and almost infinite. MVIS owns 55 patens and 90+ pending patents.With most of those very high tech patents that can be HUGE revenue income for them."

Okay guys I said this at 5 am last night, I slept all day and now the stonk is going for a cool 23 dollars!

Same question ladies and degenerates, is it worth buying at 23? This time if someone could give me some news as to why this company is taking off that would be great"
2021-04-25 22:32:49,wallstreetbets,"I had MVIS long before the GME moon mission began. It's a good stock, LIDAR is a long play, it's still an emerging tech that hasn't been fully realized imo.

2021-04-25 20:03:41,wallstreetbets,"I question the value of LIDAR in augmented reality as we ourselves use vision not LIDAR. Meaning that any augmented reality system has to be able to essentially understand vision. If it can't understand what it is seeing with vision then adding LIDAR might not add anything. Not saying it has no place, but this fantastic future seems to me, built around AI and vision, not LIDAR (or LIDAR as a specialty tool for where vision is not sufficient). You will need vision in any case so vision is a sunk cost, LIDAR is a variable that you can save money if you can skip it.

As to LIDAR in vehicles, well you are essentially betting that Elon Musk and Tesla are fundamentally wrong here, because if they are right, then everyone will drop LIDAR as quick as they can, because it is an extra unnecessary cost.

Look, not saying MVIS is not a great investment, but there are reasons to question the future profits from this tech. Of course in the short-term prices move as they move and money can be made on the hope that others buy into this positive story or some news comes out that reaffirms their glorious future."

Not financial advice. I'm just a teacher"
2021-04-25 20:25:15,wallstreetbets,"Please explain how AR will make construction go quicker?? A person that is working in construction should know how to read drawings and do not need AR for them to conceptualize how something is to be built. They already have that technology and it is called BIM. BIM even has its problems and causes change orders all the time because of coordination issues. These goggles will only cause a safety hazard to the skilled workers that are building it. Can you imagine all of the OSHA fines and lawsuits that will come from this when the first accident happens. The root of the problem is bringing in young quality workers and keeping experienced workers that are good at their craft. That will make things go quicker. A good team of workers in the field make a job go quicker and under budget. This technology is only viable for a developer who wants to show potential clients what the space would look like before it is finished. But good luck selling that to a developer that is already trying to undercut every contractor for labor and materials.

I’ve Worked in construction for 10 years and own a small construction company. Small and medium size contractors couldn’t afford this. Large GC’s have only a few people testing this technology but it wouldn’t translate into the field (built) environment. It would only be in the office environment which doesn’t make the actual work go faster and more cost efficient. If they can perfect BIM it will make the jobs go smoother for the project managers, estimators, and Superintendents. Which would make for a smoother project without a lot of change orders. But there are always change orders because clients always want to make changes so it ends up being more work for the architects and more coordinating with subcontractors and vendors"

2021-04-26 15:27:08,wallstreetbets,"Grats on this play if you're invested, I disagree with your sentiment about the construction industry though. A lot of GC's and EPC's are reluctant to adopt BIM (building information modeling) and all its synergies and savings into their businesses. Augmented reality in the construction space is a possibility, but in the dog eat dog market of construction it needs a to be bonafide savings to the over all business."

2021-04-26 10:31:48,wallstreetbets,"Well I do agree with your general thesis undoubtably, the construction aspect is the only one I cant see. That would cost soo much more money for a company to implement the tech and have their employees use it. Ex: If the owner of the company I work for wanted to start that type of program, I the superintendant would have to learn to use the aug-reality, how to make changes to the prints, plus get paid while doing it since that would be ""work"". Regular blue prints have been around for 1000's of years, if it aint broke dont fix it?  Personally I think they should use their augr for the virtual word aka metta-verse. You know the coins that shall not be named...."

i could only imagine..i bought in at 1.81 and im kicking myself i didn't invest more."
2021-04-25 21:06:50,wallstreetbets,That’s exactly what I was thinking.  I bought 500 shares at 10.55 and sold 300 at 18.  Covered my expenses and made a couple hundred and I’ll let the other 200 shares ride.  When to sell the 200 though?  I’ve heard hope of 30 and even some moon missions to over 100 but who knows.
2021-04-25 20:59:46,wallstreetbets,I bought in at 10.50 and also sold just over $18!

2021-04-25 21:58:39,wallstreetbets,For once I did the right thing and set a trailing stop order. In around 10 out around 17.
2021-04-25 21:00:36,wallstreetbets,I did the same. Out on Friday around $18
2021-04-25 21:32:07,wallstreetbets,"Bought at 10 and holding, stop order at 17 just in case things go sideways."
2021-04-25 21:08:45,wallstreetbets,"Same I sold a lot at $18, will buy calls at the dip. There is no reason to believe this company will be bought out anytime soon, and if they do it won’t be this week."

But this can go back to 15 just as quick as 30+ right now I think..good long play for sector is FRSX...thats the looooong play. Muhahah"
2021-04-25 22:43:37,wallstreetbets,"Nah you were very smart.  The buyout rumors are bullshit, can't Google anything on it reliable.  ""Buyout imminent"" is all originating on Reddit / Stocktwits and circulating there."

2021-04-25 22:45:51,wallstreetbets,"0 revenue, 0 product, 0 inventory.  History of big promises and under-delivering.

Buyout rumors all started and end in the Reddit echo chamber.  Nothing from Google on it except the CEO stating ""we are trying to sell"" which they better fucking do because they have no other way to make money.

LiDAR - late entrant in a super competitive field.  We have a 2 minute hype video thus far, nothing more.  Primary application is SDC's a tech that isn't viable yet and likely will not be for decades.

I go with meme.  But retard strength is a thing so tomorrow is unpredictable.  If it keeps going though def. gonna buy puts.  I was lucky to get in at 10 and paper-handed at 16 because shit started to look fishy and well winnings is winnings fuck it."

2021-04-26 01:14:44,wallstreetbets,Same. Also the only performer 😎
2021-04-25 22:53:08,wallstreetbets,I would have thought that LAZR would be a better LIDAR bet. LAZR actually capitalizes on their patents unlike MVIS. Why do ppl think MVIS will become the LIDAR king when it’s clear their patents don’t really make too much money and they over spend on R&D and could never really capitalize on their products...

2021-04-25 20:31:25,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-04-25 20:54:54,wallstreetbets,"I think lidar is big for the AR Bc it helps scale things. If you’re doing a massive contraction site, seeing the 3D model of the building requires it to scale in size as you move closer further etc. lidar I think helps with this and the ability for you to interact with the AR as it can sense your movement, lidar isn’t a the main focus on the AR either. They have a ton of patents for memes laser that make the AR possible, it’s not the lidar, just something that helps a little."
2021-04-26 00:46:55,wallstreetbets,"Apple already bet on LIDAR for AR in the latest iPhone, and we are probably going to see it in their AR glasses. 

Until recently the hardware costs behind LIDAR were the limiting factor in adaptation. With lower cost units becoming available it wouldn’t be surprising to see if more widely used."
2021-04-25 20:08:57,wallstreetbets,"Just in regards to the autonomous vehicle and lidar, you may be betting against Tesla or Elon but there are plenty of big car companies that have plans to use lidar. I would say a bigger factor is that there is a lot of competition so it just depends who gets the best contracts and who can develop the best tech in lidar!"

2021-04-25 21:15:37,wallstreetbets,"The use of AR in construction is regarding clash detection on large construction projects and unique building situations that require a complex assemblies. There are many companies building digital twins of buildings, like Willow, that can benefit from AR usage. 

Right now there is a company working on complex assemblies for AR called Fologram, the tech is promising and speeds up construction time on these types of assemblies. Companies/Universities are still in the research phase of using AR but there are plenty of case studies showing how the tech is beneficial. 

The tech is not meant for small projects, it’s meant for projects like sofi stadium and huge developments, the use of a digital twin, and people who actually can harness the power of BIM. Not just drafters that say they can use Revit. Being able to do this does reduce Change orders and increase project schedule. Saving the client in the end even though the upfront cost may be more. 
A prominent construction firm researching AR is XL construction in collaboration with Google R+D

I can understand not having faith in it. It’s quite obviously mainly  influenced by speculation and any news stating it’s going to fail to deliver or be longer than anticipated is going to trigger a massive sell off but really that’s not going to happen till the 29th I think most people are still safe to expect a further run up till then."

2021-04-25 20:07:18,wallstreetbets,I’m there with ya. Apparently MVIS has never dipped hard before.
2021-04-25 21:27:13,wallstreetbets,"Lol .... and you’re sure that benefits MVIS? Because some guy took apart a Hololens more than a year ago and saw MVIS chip? 

If your thesis is based on MSFT you should be worried. MVIS earned a total of $3M revenue in 2020. If MSFT is indeed their only customer, MSFT thinks they’re worth $3M a year. 
 
From 10-K. Apes are positive that MSFT is the “April 2017 customer” welp 

The decrease in contract revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was attributed to decreased contract activity because the contract with our April 2017 customer was completed in 2019. **Our contract backlog, including orders for prototype units and evaluation kits, at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was zero.**


The decrease in product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to reduced product shipments to a major technology company. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019 and through the end of February 2020, we were selling components to a high definition display system that we developed for a customer under a development agreement. **The volume and resulting revenue and gross profit from this business was fairly low.** Therefore, in March 2020 we transferred production of the components to the customer. Starting in March 2020, we earn a royalty from the customer for each unit shipped"
2021-04-25 22:14:46,wallstreetbets,"There are already clash detection softwares out there. Why couldn’t you just use a tablet to take around and visualize the 3D image for clash detection?. Oh wait they already do that... It just seems like another added cost to an owner. But I guess if it’s a government funded project who cares 🤷‍♂️
Lidar has use in construction that I think adds value. Especially when you can save time and equipment cost for shooting a point cloud to get dimensions and a 3D image. But I don’t think AR will ever catch mainstream construction practices until the cost equals to the value it has created"
2021-04-25 21:35:55,wallstreetbets,Looks like a lot of people just standing around looking at a 3D image that most of them can visualize on a drawing
2021-04-25 22:55:02,wallstreetbets,"I guess this could save paper. They wouldn’t need architectural drawings and various others, to get certain heights. Could save a marginal amount of time, to not have to find those drawings. But the tablets they use, have search features as well. I digress; innovation is innovation  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯."
2021-04-25 22:56:42,wallstreetbets,I know that its useless
2021-04-26 09:42:20,wallstreetbets,Thx
2021-04-26 09:32:25,wallstreetbets,"You’re essentially gambling that on 5/28, the price will be $40 or higher. Usually people sell contracts before the expiration date, unless they have the cash to exercise the option (1 option is a contract for 100 shares). If the price is higher than your strike price (ie. $40), then the owner of the contract can exercise that option to buy 100 shares of the respective stock at the strike price. For example if MVIS is at $50 on 5/28 and he exercises the option, then he will buy 100 shares at the price of $40 each; immediately making roughly $1000 (minus the premium, the price you paid for the contract). Granted this could all change depending on what the stock does after acquiring.

Pretty basic rundown of buying calls, hope it helps. Godspeed retard.

Edit: I accidentally said on 5/28, when in reality the owner of the contract can exercise the call at any given time. It just expires on that day."

2021-04-25 22:21:02,wallstreetbets,"I'm holding.  It will.  MVIS exists not as a legitimate going concern, but solely as a vehicle to fuck me in the ass, depriving me of capital.

My positions I've had since my first run up finally went green.  It will absolutely be sub $10 by close on Tuesday."
2021-04-25 21:37:15,wallstreetbets,It was at $10 a week ago. $13 is not unreasonable at all. A lot of profit taking can happen in 4 days
2021-04-26 16:08:09,wallstreetbets,Simple I will never brake. Even with the low acceleration of RTGs if I never brake I should reach a good speed.

2021-04-26 15:58:20,wallstreetbets,"Good decision, it hit 27.30 today! Will see where the rest of the week comes.

2021-04-25 23:48:44,wallstreetbets,"They moved up the earnings call, pretty strong signal. I've been along for several of these cycles on MVIS and this time feels different. I'm not selling any covered calls, that's for sure"

2021-04-25 22:23:43,wallstreetbets,What would it likely go to? I’m thinking of selling at 40
2021-04-25 23:45:51,wallstreetbets,"If it doesn't drop the sell order isn't triggered.  If it DOES drop, then I wait til I think we're near the bottom of the dip and decide if I want buy back in.  I'm not waking up at 5:30 am to monitor this minute by minute lol"
2021-04-26 07:49:41,wallstreetbets,"I’m not too familiar with a lot of other Lidar companies. So it’s a little hard for me to say, but I know at least with data collection as well as actual size, MVIS is a big front runner and it makes them viable in more markets than just cars. Things like alternate reality, can greatly benefit. At this point there have been rumors that Ford could be the company most likely to buy them out, but Microsoft, Apple, the military and various other big companies would also see huge benefits from acquiring MVIS."
2021-04-26 15:45:34,wallstreetbets,"From what I’ve heard, Ford, Apple, Microsoft are some of the companies that are looking for LiDar solutions. One of the former execs from Ford now works for MVIS as well which spurred many to believe that it could influence their decision."
2021-04-25 23:52:34,wallstreetbets,I mean that's literally what everybody said about Tesla until this year

2021-04-25 23:07:50,wallstreetbets,"FOMO is how you become a bagholder.  Taking profits when theres a huge run-up based on completely unfounded mania, on no news at all, is just smart."
2021-04-26 06:16:46,wallstreetbets,"Idk, looks like GME 2.0 but whatever it'll likely end badly with lots of bagholders.  Idgaf I'll just be waiting with puts when it starts to fizzle."
2021-04-26 06:08:45,wallstreetbets,"Waymo, THE LEADER in SDC's himself has said this."
2021-04-26 06:11:14,wallstreetbets,I don't have a position yet although I might get some puts tomorrow.  If you see my comment history I'm mainly replying to an army of MVIStards at this point.  I shared a few negative opinions and my inbox died. Literally 200+ msgs.

2021-04-25 21:15:18,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily. Plus giants like Volkswagen and Merc can easily keep costs lower than Tesla and dominate the market even while using lidar. Tesla just has a stupid market cap which doesn’t speak for their bottom line, but the other automakers can catch up and even surpass Tesla in the autonomous driving industry."
2021-04-26 08:20:38,wallstreetbets,Enjoy losing money while everyone else makes it on MVIS this week I guess lol
2021-04-25 23:21:34,wallstreetbets,"It calls for a minimum of 300,000 IVAS units so yes I do believe it benefits microvision.  At the end of the day you’re looking at the value of the company all wrong.  It’s not about how much money they’re currently earning, it’s about the impact their technology can have on the future.  Most longs are holding for a buyout Bc they potentially hold the keys to essential technologies in the future."
2021-04-25 22:50:51,wallstreetbets,"You’re right, one can use a tablet to visualize the clashes on sight and this is quite effective. The case for using hololense is that one it allows the workers hands to be free and manipulations on site can be made that update the model in real-time so that clashes can be detected and fixed. While that is more applicable to AEC, I find the ability the create bespoke construction assemblies more interesting as it negates the contractor having to interpret the drawings and gives the full assembly in the headset. This making sure that the built construction is identical to the digital model.  I think this tech will have an impact on future construction, once it is shown that it does save time and money.  I think right now we are still in the stage of adventure and awe but in a few years the Mixed Reality will become commonplace on site."

2021-04-25 21:58:43,wallstreetbets,"Per MVIS seems that they are hoping to achieve scale at a price below $1,000 ASP (not sure what ASP means, but assume it means the complete LIDAR module).

So tell me, how many LIDAR sensors like this would you need in a car? If the cost of buying and installing such a system runs $1,000, if you have two of them that is going to cost you $2,000... Well don't forget, you also need cameras because vision and all that can't be avoided. So let's do some math... if you are planning on selling 10M cars a year and you can save $1,000 per car, that comes to... $10B in profit per year. If you need two sensors and you can save now $2,000 per car, that is $20B in profits.

So, yeah... If you can solve autonomy without LIDAR, only a company run by morons would use LIDAR."

Seval OZ joined BOD a few months back when the April demo was announced and there was no S3 or S4 filing outlining her compensation which either means she is working for free or being compensated from an external source for being their. IMO she is a pawn for the hiring company to oversee the demo and eventually the acquisition. Within the last week MVIS dropped an SEC filing that outlined the details Sumit Sharma’s compensation in the event of a buyout. Everything that has happened recently is about as close to saying a buyout is imminent without simply coming out and saying it.

This could basically prove that Microsoft has already made a deal with MVIS and we’re just waiting on a definitive answer now. A lot of the time before an acquisition, the price of shares takes a big dip which deters the less serious investors from the stock. Up until just a day or two ago, MVIS was in a pretty big dip, so as far as I can tell I’m going to be holding all 511 of my shares and I expect the share value to increase"

I am just going with MVIS's own release as to pricing, I guess you have a better source of info. Even if each car had one sensor at a cost of $750, if that is an unnecessary cost in 10M cars that is $7.5B in profits. It is really hard for me to conceive of any situation, where if this cost can be avoided, automakers do not do their best to exclude it.

I have no position in MVIS (traded some calls last week.. nothing significant) currently. Like I said short-term stocks can go all different ways. I was mainly offering that anyone considering investing long-term in this should consider the bear case here. Granted, if LIDAR ends up being necessary for self-driving and the cost is low enough it is clear MVIS will be a great long-term investment. Myself, I am very skeptical of this rosy future."

I’m asking you about Tesla’s products from 2003 to 2008. 

From my standpoint Tesla and MVIS are way different types of companies. Tesla makes a product whereas MVIS licenses it’s technologies. Their technology is behind the Microsoft Hololens. Even their A-Sample they’re working on now isn’t exactly a “product”. 

I’m not familiar with the company pre 2010’s but I’m also not sure that’s relevant to today’s company, but when have they received billions in funding?"

To some extent you are right about the echo chamber phenomenon. At some point you have to take the facts of what is happening and draw your own conclusions. If you truly do your DD you will find there are too many moving parts to toss this up as coincidence. You can Google all you want and nobody will announce that a buyout is imminent. That’s simply not how this works. You won’t get those sorts of query results until the buyout is officially announced.

Current Utilization:   **100%**   \-   7 days ago: 99.40%

Days to cover:   **0.93.**   \-   10% increase from 7 days ago. Should go up alot when January isn't calculated in the 3 month average. 

3 month average:   **156 Million Shares**    \-   Should go down alot after the April, since the crazy average volume comes from end of January, and it has decreased alot in Mars/April.

I didn't mind that they were issuing shares to raise capital, because I figured they were going to use the opportunity provided them to make a big move to be able to come into reopening with a real jolt. Maybe a $PLAY acquisition or at the very least a partnership. Use the time to retool their operations to an all in one entertainment option of some sort instead of the tired old model of $20 movie tickets and overpriced chicken sandwiches.

Instead, executive leadership used the money to hand themselves fat bonuses for ""saving"" the company when they literally didn't do anything but let the share price be elevated on sentimentality and meme status and act like they had something to do with it.

Then they asked to issue even more shares. No vision. Just cashing in and using the company like an ATM.

So I voted no. Millions of times. Then spent a few days unwinding my position. The company is dead to me. I don't know why anybody would invest in them. They had an entire year to come up with ideas on how to grow their operations or make a move, and they literally just collected their paychecks and raided the company coffers. That's bad leadership"

Just committed to my sink cost fallacy. And trying to make smarter moves in the future. Whether boomer stonks or big gambles."

2021-04-25 20:53:39,wallstreetbets,R/amc
2021-04-25 21:42:10,wallstreetbets,Because AMC was trading at $6 pre-pandemic and they diluted the shit out of the shareholders in the last twelve months and have plans to sell another $500M in shares while the CEO showered himself with a hefty payday. All the while streaming became more popular further denting their business model. I'm not a AMC hater and hope shorts get rammed but this is not a long term play imo....
2021-04-25 23:04:37,wallstreetbets,"To OP, regardless of what all of you new people think, 23% is NOT heavily shorted. Stop comparing it to Gamestop. 

23% is not 140%

153M shares on loan. Yea, 153M out of 450M. Gamestop was 98M on loan out of 70M. See the difference? More shares on loan than even existed. 

Days to cover means exactly zero, it means nothing. It's not a requirement. 

Remember seeing those Failure to Deliver numbers? If part of your premise for why you think this stock is going to squeeze is: ""The shorts have to cover."" And ""Days to cover is 'x' days"", then how do you reconcile that theres easily 3x the available shorted shares to purchase to cover those shorts? And how do you reconcile that the shorts have to cover in 'X' days but theres massive failures to deliver?"
2021-04-25 23:38:03,wallstreetbets,Also loading hella puts on this soon people just flat out don’t go to the movies like that. This stock has always been a g m e hanger on. Time to move on.

That was like 4 months ago. WSB has been around for like 5+ years buddy."

2021-04-26 06:52:22,wallstreetbets,"Because is overrated garbage stock, that barely fluctuates. If you have hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars to throw away, you can buy when is below 10, and sell when is 10.60 ... or in the rare occasions it hits 12... honestly is volatile like hell ... I did the mistake of buying this shit, and lost over 2 dollars in value while I was taking a piss. This is a stock that requires your constant attention, and with so low margins, is so damn easy to lose money. I've been looking at this stock for months, and is been a while since I sold. And I don't feel that I missed something... fortunately, even if I lost like 3 times money on this stock, it was all just pocket change, nothing substantial... there is way much better stock out there, for both short and long term. Is really no point in bothering with this one. Peoples have been trying to make this one the second GME, but it failed ... some more wealthy members made some money, but overall this is nothing like GME ... the directors are morons, the shares got diluted, and it's already over priced. This stock was worth 6 dollars before the pandemic ... how the heck is it worth 10-12 dollars now ? ... especially after dilution. This stock is a waste of money. I am curious how the price would change, once the cinema's fully open again, but I am not very optimistic...."
2021-04-25 22:50:43,wallstreetbets,Cause they’re a failing company and it was a short squeeze play. Remember when it went from $4 to $20 in a day? That was when you take profits and move on. Amc is still a failing company
2021-04-26 07:28:55,wallstreetbets,"No one cares about a dying movie theatre that have issued millions of new shares and are still trading double what they were pre covid, and even if a squeeze were possible (which its not) they would just issue new shares to raise money (since there a dying company) and people would be able to cover there shorts🤔"

2021-04-26 07:40:24,wallstreetbets,Well GME has now reached a herd level cultist following so it will dominate until it crashes completely.  MVIS is now up +100% since it was first being promoted here 2 weeks ago so rightfully so it's going to get some attention for a good while.  It's lifting off and is printing.  AMC.. still trading back and forth between 9.9 and 12 and will likely do so for some time.
2021-04-26 09:42:16,wallstreetbets,BC AMC blows dude....they sold so many freaking shares and theyre still in so much debt they'll never get out.

Considering that they went from a 100k to 450k float over this last year they are over valued compared to their best years. 

There is zero innovation with AMC, other than placing a sub woofer under your asshole.

There are no fundamentals. And they can literally kill a squeeze even if they are shorted past 100%."

2021-04-26 17:48:49,wallstreetbets,"I like the brand itself; their marketing, the atmosphere of the theaters themselves... it *feels* like a premium experience, even if it's one of the worse AMC locations. I've only been to a couple different theater companies, but AMC has always been my favorite. I also like how they pivoted to offering a rental of entire movie rooms for a party to reserve; perhaps an obvious move, but so smart to implement this. 

I don't have DD on the company's practices or leadership, but I think the brand itself has lots of untapped potential. They have a large number of theaters (perhaps the most) and like many have noted, the pandemic has led to a huge pent-up demand for this kind of luxury entertainment experience. 

If they could step up their snack game, improve their staff culture, and survive until things get back to normal, I could see huge improvements for them. They'd really go to the moon if they could find alternative ways to add value to the theater experience and utilize empty movie rooms."
2021-04-26 08:49:28,wallstreetbets,"To me, this always seemed obvious... like, the GME bull thesis was DESPITE it being a terribly run company and the squeeze only became a potentiality because of transformation. While the AMC thesis was... theaters are good? In a market full of competition, current and future? Was there the idea somewhere that people who got rich driving the company into the ground would change their course?"

2021-04-26 08:53:38,wallstreetbets,This is what kept me away from the stock. I haven't seen anything that makes me feel like the stock is going to go any higher then it was pre-pandemic.
2021-04-26 09:57:27,wallstreetbets,"Well that of course, but most importantly.. AMC is Silver number one.."
2021-04-26 10:17:50,wallstreetbets,The fact that they didn't open up blow-up drive-ins in their parking lots on day one is all I needed to see to know that they suck.

2021-04-26 11:58:42,wallstreetbets,yep
2021-04-26 12:17:48,wallstreetbets,"The bonuses were contractually obligated and agreed to as part of total compensation before hand, no?"

2021-04-26 06:43:25,wallstreetbets,Yup I lost like 20k when tsla was 500 a share because I bought puts.

2021-04-25 22:01:45,wallstreetbets,Pretty laughable as GMC is a religion and you censor other tickets
2021-04-26 04:30:07,wallstreetbets,"Well you basically decided that it can't be talked about in a dedicated daily thread. And since 99.999% of threads are auto removed you've effectively neutered discussion. 

Y'all set the expectation that you will make daily threads of every highly mentioned ticker. Gme and Amc should continue having daily threads until the community decides otherwise. I shouldn't have to explain that mods have no business deciding what the community wants for them but then again y'all already ruined this sub five times over so I have next to no expectations anymore."

I am not saying that you mod guys are deleting posts. What I am saying is that people won't post about AMC or you name the stock bcs of the environment that can be very negative. Freedom of speech is always worth fighting for but respect the person you're arguing with is worth just as much."

And there are no more shares to short bcs we hold the rest 300 million shares. I think it will rocket in time, gamma or short it will rocket."

2021-04-25 23:52:14,wallstreetbets,I’ve been around here since 2014. People who say ‘old wsb’ these days just mean like four months ago.
2021-04-25 22:51:33,wallstreetbets,Same bro I barely got into stocks in the beginning of January because of gme and wsb. This sub has taught me a lot believe it or not. But like u said I’m more interested in learning about everything else GME was just a gateway for me. I’m just soaking everything in and hopefully one day I can my loss porn on here(if I ever post a loss porn then that means I actually made it)

2021-04-25 20:34:50,wallstreetbets,"It's honestly really sad.  The old sub was such an interesting and unique place, with a hard-to-define sense of humor and camaraderie, as well as some interesting posts and concepts.  

Now it is just the same bullshit day after day, with lowest-common-denominator humor and the same GME posts and comments spammed thousands of times every single day.  Even when all of these GME people finally accept reality and leave, it's probably impossible to capture the old spirit and atmosphere."
2021-04-25 21:38:04,wallstreetbets,Yep. I've been offending the clowns for some time now. I got sick of it. I've lurked here for years and I hate what became of the sub. I learned so much here. Then it turned into fake DD and people thinking this sub was a movement.

2021-04-26 02:40:52,wallstreetbets,"Hey come on now GME is a once in a lifetime event. Hedgefund shorts got smacked, said it was over but then got caught and smacked up a second time, now I have no idea what's going on but they might still be slowly getting smacked around. The ups and downs on GME are astronomical compared to other stocks and you can't even see the ups accurately on charts since the times they really finally decided to pay out they did so in single ultra brief price spikes."

2021-04-26 01:57:01,wallstreetbets,They still have 43M previously authorized shares to dilute this year before starting with with new 500M tranche next year. Seems way more likely to slowly bleed back to reality than to squeeze.
2021-04-26 06:51:58,wallstreetbets,"That is true they don't dilute with the new shares if the vote passes. 

They will probably do it early next year as soon as they can though. Again if the vote passes. They barely have enough money for 2021 so it really would not be surprising at all if it passes that they dilute the current amount they can and then further dilute next year in 2022."
2021-04-26 10:10:48,wallstreetbets,His cost basis is significantly different than about 99.9% of people on here and he has already locked in life changing amounts of money. Him doubling down is a free roll. Try again.

Kong vs Godzilla 
Mortal Combat 


It’s New CEO has an incredible business history with ties to blackrock. They know he is a moneymaker

The company is making money and has soaring mobile app downloads and its streaming service is AMC on demand not amc networks

It’s doing all of this on half capacity. This is not Toys R Us. Management has done an amazing job considering they had to go from 500m in rev to 0 overnight 

They weren’t trending across social pre Covid either? 
 I still think it’s short sighted to not look at the fact that it’s trending on social media and is the biggest movie chain coming out of a pandemic which is now adapting to streaming plus mobile subscribers"

Just like the game store only rents space in strip malls.  And not a lot of demand for giant ass buildings which can only be used as standalone Macy's or something.  Most of those are getting gutted and turned into Amazon fulfillment centers."
2021-04-26 11:52:28,wallstreetbets,I have to agree our AMC theaters opened up here in Washington state and all tickets sold out. And a few hundred people outside. We live in a rainy state we like our movies.
2021-04-26 10:23:54,wallstreetbets,"yeah, this is certainly fair and I know its a big element of the gme thesis, too -- in both cases the shorts came from a place of shorting terrible management, and unfortunately for my amc homies, without an RC-force it looks like management will continue to rip failure from a jaws of success despite some good fundamentals on their side. fwiw I genuinely hope Im wrong and would love to see some short fucking, of course"
2021-04-26 10:34:00,wallstreetbets,"Altough true, its imo still ""shitty"" RE. Again comparing to GS, which had shops (many in malls), which you can transform from brick and mortar to whatever you want or selling it, as there always will be demand for some other retail company.

With AMC again, you get a specific kind of Realestate with a big ass screen and seats in it, theres not much you can really change it into, without a major overhaul.

And thats again where GS is much better positioned going forward. The gaming sector has been steadily growing, year after year and the demand exploded during Covid. 

With AMC again, its aa complete other story. Cinemas have been already dying slowly pre covid, there barely are any movies worth going to the cinema for and most of the cinemas have been survining on overpriced popcorn and soft drinks. Covid also didnt help and as Covid is picking up again, and god forbid some mutation pops up that makes our current vaccines useless, then there is no future for cinemas imo"
2021-04-26 10:32:25,wallstreetbets,"What squeeze? They've already shown they have no hesitancy to issue more shares and cash out, what makes you think there's any possibility of a squeeze when the target is perfectly willing to dilute itself?"

2021-04-26 12:27:47,wallstreetbets,"Interesting point that I was not aware of, thanks.

Traditional movie theater competition is shrinking while streaming competition is growing.  Some people believe that streaming will replace/exceed traditional competition.  I'm betting that long term streaming competition is not as bad as many think.  All AMC has to do to gain market share is survive.  

Why do I think this?  Not a very good reason but.... I rarely watch movies at home or the theater.  I much much much prefer the theater though.  If the kids wake up the babysitter can handle it.  I'm cuddling with the wife and eating popcorn until my lips fall off."

&#x200B;

Also, ""quits"" is code for ""the Norwegians were kind enough to let him save face and not get fired""  Aron's big stamp at the movie theatre was to be to capitulate to movie studios in shortening the exclusive window theatres had for new releases.  Oh, and acquiring Carmike and Cineplex Odeon to reduce competition in the space, which yielded no real earnings fruit but did serve to make the transactional experience worse. The guy has a long history of fucking up.

&#x200B;

He helped to run Pan Am into the ground. He helped take Hyatt from being a global force to a niche player in hotel space through terrible marketing.  He was part of domestic air travel going to shit, he couldn't turn Norwegian around, and all he did to save Vail was capitalize on the value of the real estate.

&#x200B;

Oh, and let's not forget that his big move to ""save"" the share price when it began to tumble when they put that extra dilution to a vote was to make a press release promising jilted Redditors that he promised he wouldn't dilute them to oblivion again until next year.  The guy doesn't get it."

Why such efforts if it didn't have the potential to squeeze?

As for the 500 million shares, yes that could be a possibility since they would be doing so in attempts to save the company, but this will also affect their relationship when it comes to retail investors. If they keep their word of not using the 500 million shares this year, not only will they profit from it but they will gain and maintain the trust and loyalty of retail investors."

Think of it as Wix, but for automation and artificial intelligence, only Wix simplfies the process of web design for their users, while UiPath simplifies the process of designing and applying intelligent bots and deep learning. Their purpose, they claim is “To accelerate human achievement”. More from their IPO filing:

“Our platform leverages the power of AI-based computer vision to enable our robots to perform a vast array of actions as a human would when executing business processes. These actions include, but are not limited to, logging into applications, extracting information from documents, moving folders, filling in forms, and updating information fields and databases. Our robots’ ability to learn from and replicate workers’ steps in executing business processes drives continuous improvements in operational efficiencies and enables companies to deliver on key digital initiatives with greater speed, agility, and accuracy.”

Cool story, bro. Let’s talk fundamentals.

Its market cap is currently \~40B USD. It has INSANE gross margins, between 82-89% for the last two years. They’ve cut their operating costs from $520M to $92M in just a single year, trimming their cost of sales and marketing from 144% of revenue to 62%. This investment in sales and marketing has already offered immediate returns. It has generated revenues of $336M and $607M in the last two years, representing a growth rate of 81% YoY. The icing on this cake? They also disclose that their top 50 customers increased their spending by a MULTIPLE OF 81x from their first month to present spending. In other words, the clients with the most money to spend couldn’t wait to give this company more money.

More: “As of January 31, 2020, we had 6,009 customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 61% of the Fortune Global 500. As of January 31, 2021, we had 7,968 customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 63% of the Fortune Global 500.” The company is already disrupting the accounting industry. A representative from PwC spoke about saving 5 MILLION HOURS of work by using UiPath, saving them $500M already.

And then the cherry on top? Cathie Wood and ARK Invest have already purchased 2.7M shares.

TLDR: UiPath talks the talk, but they walk the walk. And I like the stock.

**Fair/intrinsic value: \~$400**

Current Value: $74.84

You can build a “robot” or robots to do that (log into systems, input data) so you no longer have to. You spend your time doing the knowledge work. So think rpa as automating those mindless tasks.

A few years ago I transferred to a new “automation” group that was building robots. It was 6 months in and they were using Blue Prism. After another 6 months in, I was the resident technical expert as I was one of the few that actually had a programming background.

An exec in another side of the business wanted UiPath for his area. The leader of our area was not receptive to it but after the COO got involved we needed to look into it.

I felt horrible having to write a glowing recommendation of UiPath over Blue Prism after the team spent so much money investing in it. Also I looked into AA as well as part of that and was not a fan."

2021-04-26 09:49:35,wallstreetbets,"Yet the vast majority of people on this sub are the main drivers of the HFT market by refusing to accept anything other than free trading platforms with zero commission trades. What’s more, you actively make fun of idiots that would have the audacity to pay a platform or advisor a commission or fee for trades, you know who isn’t selling your odd-lot small volume order flow to citadel so they can front run it.... 

The only way a platform like Robin Hood can exist in perpetuity by giving you free access to their platform and free trades is payment for order flow. We’ve seen the articles posted here more than we can count, how Robin Hood receives nearly double if not triple the price for their order flow compared to places like fidelity or Schwab, how they even get caught giving their customers worse than average fills and have paid huge fines for it in the process. Yet, how many people on here have actually left “free” trading platforms like RH for a platform that doesn’t engage in these practices? 

Yes, HFTs have done a lot to narrow spreads in the market and create added liquidity especially in names that have low daily trading volume, go fund any small cap stock with tiny volume and put a buy order in at the market or even a limit order around the market price and chances are you’ll get filled within a few seconds, back in the day you’d probably need to put a GtC order in and wait hours if not days for it to fill. And again, platforms like Robin Hood could not exist without them. How many of you upvoted this post, but still logged into RH today to make some trades...."

2021-04-26 12:41:19,wallstreetbets,"Dark pools allow larger orders to execute without tipping their hands and moving markets as much.  That's it.  It's not shady or nefarious.  In fact, some of those large institutional orders may come from places like Vanguard, meaning less market impact -> better retail returns in 401ks holding passively managed funds.  Vanguard has put out white papers about how HFT has reduced their trading costs.

&#x200B;

It's a fair discussion to have as to whether dark pool transactions lower liquidity in markets and whether we want this.  But markets are more than liquid enough for retail orders, this isn't something the average investor needs to worry about.  Costs to trade are lower now than they have ever been in history."

2021-04-25 21:48:13,wallstreetbets,"This is an salient point. Reminds me of a part of the book Never Split the Difference, which discusses negotiation from the perspective of a hostage negotiator. In the book he says (paraphrasing) that the perpetrator who uses the word “I” when referring to themself tends to have less control/power, for instance if they are working the job with others, and the one that uses “we” tends to have more power/control. The latter’s use of “we” is meant to both complicate the situation, by making it appear there are more people involved in the crime, and to diffuse blame off of themself, appear like the good guy or at least not like the mastermind. The author notes that it’s the “we” perpetrator who is likely the head honcho and calling the shots. 

All this to say that people/entities in control who want more control and have vested interests know that being relatable and appearing nonthreatening is a strategy to maintain their position."

False.

Google is a Marketing Firm first and foremost.

Example; they sell keyword access, if you're a Politician, the strongest thing you can do is buy influence in googles Algorithm. Turns out even they can be swayed.

How influential is the algorithm? It's so influential and so stable that sales can be gauged based on your position on the list. If your advertisement or website is on page 2, it might as well not exist, since 90% of all searches never leave the first page of results...

If your order is a 'bad price' the brokers literally give them the option to take the reverse of the trade. If they take the reverse of the trade, citadel is the one who sells you the stock not the open market."

So much so that they pay your broker to route your order through them.  Robinhood famously gets paid the most to route its order through citadel.  Since switching from robinhood to fidelity I have noticed a big difference in pricing.  I get the stocks cheaper on fidelity.

2021-04-26 12:51:48,wallstreetbets,"So what?  Why do you care who the counterparty is on your trade?  When citadel or any other HFT internalizes your trade, they will almost always give you price improvement over the open market.  Further, the brokerage selling your order has to demonstrate to the SEC that their clients are getting best execution.  So either:

a) you get the price available on the open market or

b) you get an even *better* price

How is that nefarious?  It seems to only benefit you."
2021-04-26 09:28:39,wallstreetbets,are you kidding? worse. the answer is always worse
2021-04-25 21:02:55,wallstreetbets,OTC/Dark pools are for routing orders through an exchange that does not effect the price of a stock. People looking through the OTC data see that Citadel is routing small RETAIL orders through otc/dark pool exchanges. They are abusing the system to supress stock price. They're meant to be used by market makers to route large orders so as not to make a stock jump too much when institutions enter/exit.

2021-04-26 00:54:34,wallstreetbets,"By more, he meant less."
2021-04-26 12:58:22,wallstreetbets,"His wording was poor, but what he's saying is that when Citadel executes a client order, they guarantee (as required by law and monitored by the SEC) that the client gets *no worse* than the best price that is currently publicly visible on any exchange.

Then he realizes that with dark pools, midpoint orders etc, the publicly visible best price may not be the best possible price available if you executed the order exactly the right exchange.  Since there's no way to know where a hidden order might exist (being hidden and all), Citadel is not obligated to provide that price to a retail order."
2021-04-25 23:47:44,wallstreetbets,? Check mechanisms were like the main topic at the constitutional convention.
2021-04-25 22:32:12,wallstreetbets,Not really. I talked about dark pools in another response to my top level comment. Dark pools are far less nefarious than they sound and are fairly transparent in their reporting.
2021-04-25 22:26:01,wallstreetbets,"“Dark pool” is a sinister name for something pretty ordinary. Institutional investors typically hide size by trading in a dark pool but not price. All the prices are derived from the “lit” exchanges so it’s not like a dark pool is the Wild West where traders are trading at whatever price they want. Secondly, all trades that occur in a dark pool are reported to a Trade Reporting Facility either at Nasdaq or NYSE which are then reported to the SIP, for all investors to view. A dark pool isn’t particularly scandalous and trades that occur there are fully transparent.

Also, I’m old enough to remember paying 10 bucks a trade on TD Ameritrade. Commission free trading for the retail investor is because of the much maligned payment for order flow. Payment for order flow isn’t particularly scandalous either and I’ve written another long explanation on the practice. Basically, because retail flow is uninformed regarding short term price movements and uncorrelated, a market maker like citadel securities can earn the spread on retail volume without the risk of adverse selection. They can also improve execution for their other strategies by buying/selling passively at the near price. Certainly there is a volume threshold at which 10 bucks is cheap relative to 1 or 2 tick slippage, but I doubt retail investors are trading at that size.

Other than that, I agree that because of retail internalization by citadel, virtu, etc., order flow that hits lit exchanges tends to be more toxic, but that affects precisely none of you trading here via RH or TD or whatever. 

I also agree that PhD’s are hired to game financial markets but there is a TON of money in it so I can’t really blame them. I got into this industry because I have technical skills and want to make a ton of money. All that providing liquidity and social good explanation is bullshit. I’m also only an undergrad and trade my own book now, but that is my main motivation. 

Anything else I can answer?"
2021-04-25 22:58:50,wallstreetbets,"Yes , not only are they making money on the bid/ask... but there may very well be something more nefarious going on. No one will ever know. The only people that will know are the phds who signed the million NDAs and won't talk about it. For example,  they could be stepping in front of the trades and taking the opposite position and filling from dark pool shares so that retail buys dont affect a stock price unless they WANT it to. Do you know how much money you make when you completely control the price of a stock... because you get to decide whether the orders actually hit the exchange or not ?!"
2021-04-25 23:23:30,wallstreetbets,"Anyone who works in HFT knows the business model even if it isn’t the exact strategy they use. It’s basically high frequency market making which is 80-90 percent of HFT activity. So yes, I do know exactly what they do with that order flow."
2021-04-25 21:50:27,wallstreetbets,Market makers have always existed. And they’ve always been insiders who can react quickly. Not sure how a bunch computers competing is worse. It appears to be cheaper.
2021-04-25 23:29:14,wallstreetbets,"Markets always require a buyer and seller. Dark pools only keep a transaction private, they can’t control the terms between buyers and sellers on public markets. Most of a market makers job is pairing between different exchanges. Given the prevalence of hft dealers are incentivized to keep their trading private so they don’t get front run, thus the popularity of dark pools. When you hear Ken talking about how bad dark pools are and how we need transparent markets it’s bc he’s faster and wants to front run. Imo."

Fucking shits thought they were being clever when all it did was make people (like me) resent them; even with location turned off, you can see that the request is coming in from a Brooklyn IP (and at least an NY one, and most definitely at least a US one). Still gets me fired up lol.

Look into Payment for Order Flow. Citadel, for example, buys order flows from robinhood and then earns a profit on the bid-ask spread. It might be a few pennies per order, but it adds up quickly when there are millions of orders coming in per day.

Citadel was fined for using order flow data to direct trading activities, however. They would see where volume was and long/short it wayyy before the market would ever have access to that data. I'm sure this still happens regularly though, and there are no clear regulations that aim to prevent this AFAIK."

2021-04-26 01:53:36,wallstreetbets,"This depends. I am an engineer, not software. But you still can get tough interviews later in your career. 

I had a full day interview a year ago at a smaller tech company you have heard of. And it was tough. I have about 7 years experience in my role. I am an electro-acoustics systems engineer. 

And even with the experience i was getting very technical questions, and one of the interviewers was a phd in material science who was grilling me kn FEA simulations making me go to the white board and work things out. 

Why did they grill me in those things? Cause it was in my resume.  

So it can still be tough with hoops to jump through, but with the experience it's more like, if it's in your resume, expect them to make you show you know it. And just be honest. (I did get that job offer. But didn't pay enough to justify relocating my family so I turned it down.)

And I know my work is different than cs. But I have also had an interview at a tech company that is well known for tough interviews where they did give me programming problems, even though I'm not a programmer in my job beyond simulation work."
2021-04-26 03:09:30,wallstreetbets,A limit order just says don't pay more than this for that stock.  Say you like a stock and you set a limit order for 10 dollars for it.  You use robinhood and they send it to Citidels dark pool.  The stock is there for 9.90.  Citidels high frequency traders algo will buy it and sell it to you for 10 bucks.  They just scalped you for 10 cents and it's a dark pool so you will never know.  That's why they pay robinhood to flow your trades through them.  If you trade through a better broker you aren't in a dark pool and you get the better price.  I personally use fidelity.  Terrible app but better prices on stocks.
2021-04-26 06:12:33,wallstreetbets,It still does. Because we're talking fraction of a fraction of a fraction. Say you set your limit order for 15.50. It'll say it executed at 15.50 but really it executed at 15.500015623. On a place like Robinhood you'd get a slightly worse execution than on Fidelity. But each individual investor might be getting ripped off but he won't notice it. It's that they're making fractions of pennies on billions of trades.

(Direct feeds are faster on the order of milliseconds). All this information affects stock prices in real time. There is absolutely no concept of hiding trades and “controlling” price.

I don’t understand your example, what would Citadel gain from doing this? I just don’t think people fundamentally understand the market making business."
2021-04-26 00:21:14,wallstreetbets,"right, and if you are the buyer and citadel is the seller from their dark pool stock - the underlying stock price doesn't move. Controlling the price of a stock on the open exchange is a sure way to make tons of money... even if it is just for a day or two and deciding what trades go through to the open exchange and which are being filled from dark pool shares."

The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit."

Their “heterodox” economic ideas at this point is literally just economics fan-fiction, it’s all theorycrafting and when they stick with methodological individualism while also refusing to show how it applies to any empirical economics whatsoever, it’s not surprising none of them hold actual degrees.

As the technology and access to these data streams are technically available to the public (albeit extremely expensive and not necessarily as fast), large firms and market makers can take advantage.

It's also worth noting that some firms have been charged with fraud by mispricing securities. Citadel was fined \~$21 MM for mispricing . Citadel manages over 1000x the size of that fine. The algorithm that was mispricing securities managed an average of about 1% of the entire US market flow for over 2 years.

Major quant firms like citadel can use order flow data to rapidly assess market trends long before anyone else.

Robinhood and other pay per order flow systems get to tell you that anything you buy is real stock that you actually own , but they omit the fact that a bigger fish can step in front of your order and take the opposite position. Think about it , as long as the dark pools have 40 percent of the shares,  it means they can completely control the stock price . If you can completely control the price of a stock on the open market , you can always profit on options because anything you sell in options can be guaranteed to expire worthless.  The only way to break it out of this cycle is to purchase MORE than is available in the dark pools. This is what happened when robinhood stopped buys on gamestop. As soon as they worked it all out and now the stock price is too much for retail to deplete the dark pools completely,  it's back to a money printing machine for citadel again"

2021-04-25 23:34:57,wallstreetbets,"Amen. People always shift the responsibility to the government when the private sector does selfish or unpopular actions. Again, the companies bare the responsibility first and foremost not the government."
2021-04-26 01:48:30,wallstreetbets,exactly...one look at someone like steve munichin (same on the democrat side) and u will see he worked at Godlman Sachs before he worked in the government. Its all the same people.
2021-04-25 23:31:28,wallstreetbets,"First of all, the public sector also kills people. Negligence and corruption is prevalent from authority figures to mismanagement. Two examples are the police department or law enforcement and the other veterans affair etc. Now with that said, regulations are not the focus and people need to wake up and focus on the real culprits ** companies who commit gross practices. **  We talk about responsibility and how people need to develop a good moral sense especially in the USA. Ironically, why of all the entities we never use the same logic are businesses? Why does the government have to guide a company on how to behave? Why does the government have to be the private's sector daddy and tell him what is right and wrong? Where is the personal responsibility when it comes to the decisions and actions of corporations. We grouse about every other sector of society to have some form of morality yet when it comes to businesses or corporations why do they get the benefit of the doubt? 

Funny, how most of you are focusing on the wrong entity. Who is committing these terrible actions? The government or the private sector? Answer me this."

2021-04-25 23:00:04,wallstreetbets,"Sorry to bust your libertarian bubble, but the private sector has ALWAYS abused.  Just because they've since managed to manipulate the government to enable rather than restrain them, doesn't mean they'll just magically behave if the government is taken out of the equation. Looks at this country's own history to see what happens when capitalism isn't restrained. 

Rich douchebag capitalists don't magically become nice people if you remove government control, they just become *completely uncontrolled* rich douchebag capitalists."
2021-04-25 23:38:00,wallstreetbets,"The private sector is not a child. Stop ignoring the focus on who is to bear responsibility. The government didn't do these actions the private sector did so it is their fault. People need to believe in their personal responsibility logic or else they sound hypocritical and ignoramus. 

I thought the private sector is mature and capable enough to be self -efficient? Why does it need daddy government keeping an eye on it? 

Again, the government bares no fault, first and foremost, focus on the real culprits and that is the private sector."

2021-04-26 03:47:43,wallstreetbets,"Latency arbitrage is definitely a problem, you're right, but the post I replied to stated they observe order flow before it is executed and make trades based on that. That would be front running, which is illegal. Latency arbitrage is just kind of, ""we see shit before you can"", even by a few milliseconds, if your request to cancel your sell order is being sent to your broker, which is then sent to the clearing house, which is then sent to the exchange, by the time all that happens, the HFT already bought your stale sell order on the exchange.

Still scummy and likely predatory for sure, and it needs to be regulated, but it's a different thing, cause one is directly defrauding investors, and one is taking advantage of differences in latency between retailers and the market makers."
2021-04-25 23:11:39,wallstreetbets,Imagining...Just buy and hold w/ DCA seems like the best way to still do well with it.
2021-04-26 13:25:54,wallstreetbets,"Is there though?  Retail clients routinely get prices that are better than those available to a professional HFT desk.  The cost to trade in the US equities market is lower than ever, and it's way more liquid and fair than any other market on Earth.

Most retail customers get prices *better* than those available to professional HFT desks as they are routinely executed inside the spread.  They pay $0 commissions while they do it, and then complain that somehow someone somewhere still finds a way to make money to pay for all this infrastructure and demonize the whole industry.

Dark pools basically exist to match large institutional traders without HFTs picking them off, but they suck at it. Liquidity stratification is among the dumbest ideas in existence and unsophisticated asset managers fall for it hook, line and sinker.

It becomes and issue when regulations and fines dont actually match the scale of illegal gains and manipulation (which I also talked about in a reference to fines that Citadel has previously received).

Regulators, when combined with campaign contribution limits and ideally public financing matching have a reasonable chance of passing regulation in the public interest. If they don't, at least you have a chance of kicking out the politician that appointed them.

Even corrupt politicians don't like losing power and may be pressured to make some token moves in the public interest. A party however that argues regulation is always negative, conveniently creates an out for itself so that it doesn't have to even try, where the default heavily favours its donors."

2021-04-26 01:03:45,wallstreetbets,"Uncertainty leads to market makers pulling their quotes back and widening spreads. In simple terms, they are demanding higher compensation for making a market with greater volatility which implies greater adverse selection risk. There is obviously a derivatives market which I am not nearly as familiar with but there was some interplay there as well.

Some firms probably had alpha in those names based on retail activity and they traded with those alphas.

Some firms probably said, fuck it, and didn’t touch those stocks.

All quant firms basically realized that they need to limit their exposure to meme stocks, so they updated their risk models to reflect that."
2021-04-26 00:10:47,wallstreetbets,Right.

This possibly a long read for anybody with an attention span lower than 50 seconds and needless to say it will contain words that you were not taught in 5th grade. You read the following summary if you happen to be a drooling neanderthal  
 

Summary

Great business, getting better, smashing Intel in coming years, price is low ,gonna surge, buy fucking ape

**Performance and demand**

We are now on going through a cycle of extreme demand for products that facilitate digitalization, EV’s, pc, datacenters expanding. This has all been accelerated due to the covid cause all you dumb fucks have been watching 4k Pornhub filth from you mums basement, while pausing the newly acquired PS5. Those of you with a job perhaps thought working from home would require a new laptop and what have you.   
 AMD delivers the chips for all this. AMD doesn’t make the shit slow useless chips but the high-end stuff which the market just can’t get enough of. Take look here from last year:  


[  ](https://preview.redd.it/r00ra8z42ev61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=202c74284d233302021728aa85fb4ba74b3f424a)

Notice the gross margin rising a bit whilst revenue is up 45% Y/Y. The numbers and performance are both completely ridiculous.

 And the FCF here killing it 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/duor4te82ev61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fde98b17738977483ab0e7d77363a4c53b5e811

  

And their official outlook from last earnings:

  


[  ](https://preview.redd.it/d4c3gafa2ev61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=92970732d0fe8eee9f2ba564e0a52cdcb5cb0ac0)

Most analysts though have higher expectations than the guidance from January. Can’t blame them. AMD will in coming quarters buy XLINX and expand their business to other segments in the semi conductor industry so there is plenty of room for further growth on the outlook.

&#x200B;

  **Supply and competition**

TSMC is the main foundry supplier for AMD. They have kept prices intact but there are so far rumors that they might hike them soon enough. Last year many of the sites were shut down and capacity hasn’t met the surge we have seen late quarters. The problem is not exclusive for AMD but it’s the same for most of its competitors. They have stated though that they expect to be back on track for 2022. Intel got hammered last week in earnings with losing market share in datacenter segment and margins absolutely murdered. AMD has been trading inverse to Intel basically as the market expects AMD to be one of the main causes to Intel's howler.

However let the bears beware of the CEO’s lady Su’s own words live:  
 ""we have enormous demand, demand is very, very strong"" continuing their seeing record growth in multiple areas including PC, gaming and datacenter. Lisa added: ""to answer your question, it's good -- it's very good""  
 [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.tweaktown.com/news/78289/amd-on-the-cpu-and-gpu-chip-shortage-its-very-good/amp.html](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.tweaktown.com/news/78289/amd-on-the-cpu-and-gpu-chip-shortage-its-very-good/amp.html)  
 Now ask yourself if that’s something a smart insanely well performing CEO would say 6 weeks before an earnings report if the shortage was really smashing the business. My cents are on her being right and even a bit conservative on it.

  

**Analysts**

Market analysts are quite divided on the target ranging between 70 and 135. The best rated one here Hans Mosesmann has a price target of 120. Look at his bull following  here:  


https://preview.redd.it/sff74g1h2ev61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc0a633c6ae0959148e8859d4b968f54499e4df7

  

As for my positions I hold a few calls but mostly shares. I think this is a long-term case but earnings could be a blow out like last summer that caused the stock price to explode. Its a bet if you fancy but If you buy leaps you are defo safer. Shares are really attractive at these levels though"
2021-04-26 00:29:11,wallstreetbets,"$AMD is pegged to 10x P/S, if they meet expectations and Lisa Su reiterates 37% growth, their fair value should be around $91.50 (with a Year end target of $113) so I expect there to be a run up to that amount before earnings.  Lisa Su tends to be conservative in her guidance, so you may want to sell before earnings, or hedge your bets here.  However, I believe she'll guide much higher, considering all the rumors of extra Wafer capacity at TSMC, to as high as 80% extra capacity at 7nm, due to Apple jumping to 5nm early \[[https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-overtakes-Apple-as-TSMC-s-main-7nm-customer.528532.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-overtakes-Apple-as-TSMC-s-main-7nm-customer.528532.0.html)\]; so if you're a betting person, you'll hold onto your calls, especially if they're already ITM, because I'm expecting AMD to go stratospheric!

Vast majority of my 5/7 Calls are ITM, ranging from $75 to $82, but I also have a bunch of cheap $100 lotto Calls as well, I'm planning to keep all my Calls past earnings, since I'm expecting $91.50 to be the absolute floor.  Goodluck to all my AMD faithful, may Su Bae make us all rich this week!"
2021-04-26 00:22:18,wallstreetbets,I think the big difference here compared to the past that many are missing is the indications in Intel's earning call that AMD was cutting into them hard.. The big thing that has been keeping AMD in check is that they were against two titans (Intel and Nvidia) in their primary markets (CPU & GPU). They have have knocked one of those titans out of the box and are quickly closing the gap on the other. The 11th generation Intel chips have been slammed hard by the press and customers simply aren't excited about their offerings anymore. When their main competitor can't even manage to outperform AMD's last gen offering that puts them in a great place. This stock is poised to rally hard. Not financial advice I just like the stock. In for 50 shares @ 79.03.
2021-04-26 10:01:19,wallstreetbets,"AMD almost always tends to tank after earnings. However, it just feels different this time around. Price hasn't fully recovered since the Feb and March sell off. Still within its 100 day moving average and looking really bullish if it breaks 85. I think it goes to 100$ very soon

HODLing 70$ leaps"
2021-04-26 00:48:04,wallstreetbets,"Agree with you about Lisa Siu.  She's been pretty bullish on this quarter and at this point, gotta trust her.

I believe they beat earnings pretty convincingly"
2021-04-26 04:45:34,wallstreetbets,"Holding 26 at 78,23!! AMD will explode on April 28!"
2021-04-26 09:39:23,wallstreetbets,"AMD- wow, that brings back memories.
I remember when the Athlon was the hot new thing- it was fully pipelined!"
2021-04-26 10:00:35,wallstreetbets,"Amazing gains today as well.  


100% in calls from Thursday in total. Feels good. Won't double down though. I've been burned by that in the past. Looking forward to the data center revenues."

2021-04-26 10:42:03,wallstreetbets,"AMD has been stealing market share from Intel and instead of focusing on the immediate threat, Intel decided they were going to focus long term by building their own facilities while continually losing customers to a better product line from AMD. 


To add insult to injury, Nvidia announced its throwing its hat in the cpu ring and will their product line ready in a couple of years. 

I think for the next year or 2 AMD will continue to blow up and after that Intel will just continue to lose their contracts to Nvidia and AMD"
2021-04-26 13:35:58,wallstreetbets,"Sell some covered calls before earnings. As someone who's been fucked by Lisa Su every earnings week on long calls, I think it's a safe bet.

2021-04-26 15:14:49,wallstreetbets,Why?
2021-04-26 09:17:07,wallstreetbets,"Not much..... Have only been trading for around a Year, and in that time I've made a lot of money (relative for me), and lost a lot of money, and made it back and then some.... It's been a stressful learning experience, but I'm only up around 25% of my total cost basis for the year.  I've been watching and analyzing AMD to death, and spent more time out of my life obsessing over them than I would care to admit, so I'm more confident about my views on AMD."
2021-04-26 07:52:10,wallstreetbets,Not necessarily.

2023 calls are the way."
2021-04-25 22:31:31,wallstreetbets,They had a huge run up and now don't want to keep rising. It honestly doesn't make sense because good news just doesn't affect it anymore.
2021-04-25 22:05:31,wallstreetbets,"I guess I didn't formulate my question properly. Is it possible that the IV after earnings decreases to the point that the increase in the underlying isn't enough to compensate? If it is possible, how often does such a thing occur?"
2021-04-26 17:33:44,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, thank you. I myself have puts opened up near end of day, hoping for a sell off. Historically the selloff has been on earnings reported and a 1-2% continued growth can be expected tomorrow I think. Which should teach me a lesson."
2021-04-25 22:47:48,wallstreetbets,"That would be an interesting research to do, how often does that occur and if there are any trends. Going through each companies' earnings reports to get goals is a bit demotivating though lol."
2021-04-26 00:37:35,wallstreetbets,They dropped because DCG down YoY which means there's competition from ARM and AMD. That's a long term bear sign when data center still had growth overall
2021-04-26 08:14:37,wallstreetbets,"they had horrible earnings

data center margins dropped 20%+"

2021-04-26 02:43:46,wallstreetbets,I got them Friday for two weeks out. I am going to sell them tomorrow. Friday seemed to be a local high on the charts and most people don't like to play earnings and close their position which will drive the price down before earnings which is Tuesday

2021-04-26 13:00:38,wallstreetbets,"Alright you and I sound alike. I’ve done a ton of research into this company and despite all the good markers and catalysts, we’re trading a bit sideways in a downward channel recently. I decided to buy some calls in February. 

So I’m going to ask you point blank. I have 7 7/16 $95c at an average of 4.26 per contract. Do you think I should hold through earnings, or sell before?"
2021-04-26 10:46:23,wallstreetbets,Any insights to why AMD is so insensitive compared to other industry disruptors? I would think their trajectory in this bull run would be similar to the more explosive tickers or even Nvidia for that matter. Are they married to TSMC’s capacity now?
2021-04-26 07:55:38,wallstreetbets,Why not?
2021-04-26 02:16:28,wallstreetbets,No. If i wait 50 years you still wouldnt have won an olympic medal
2021-04-25 22:32:50,wallstreetbets,They could have some catching up to do after that run up. I plan on holding these shares for a very long time
2021-04-26 05:50:42,wallstreetbets,"Because a lot of stuff is priced in, their revenue was 3.2 billion last quarter and even if that doubled for this quarter it still wouldn't change the fact that amd isn't worth their market cap purely from a financial perspective.

The market thinks that amd will be worth 100 billion, but it's not worth that now, the market simply is betting that it will be worth that eventually. It doesn't matter if they blow earnings out of the water and make 6 billion in a quarter, so much growth is already priced in.

Of course i will happily eat my words if i'm wrong, i am personally betting on amd being worth well over 100 this year. But i don't think it will go up this earnings."
2021-04-25 22:13:42,wallstreetbets,Yes. If IV is pricing in a 2% swing and it only moves 1% even if it’s in your favor the price of your call will go down
2021-04-25 22:50:14,wallstreetbets,I think it was last earnings report where they beat earnings and the stock price went down because people's sentiment was that the stock was already priced in that they would beat earnings.
2021-04-26 01:26:28,wallstreetbets,You'd have to look at the charts and numbers for their past earnings. Don't compare AMD to other companies tho. Perhaps maybe only in the same sector if you do.
2021-04-26 01:30:28,wallstreetbets,Their loss of Data center market is actually the real reason I’m playing AMD calls for earnings. Totally doesn’t mean AMD picked up a bigger market share but if they did 🚀
2021-04-26 02:46:55,wallstreetbets,Strike? Thinking of getting rid of my calls tmrw and switching for puts Tuesday
2021-04-26 09:49:39,wallstreetbets,"Ok, understandable hehe. I'm pretty hopeful for this report tbh. I think they will have to move up the guidance a bit. Feels like they could deliver a ""STFU-report"" this quarter, as we say in Sweden (håll käften-rapport)."
2021-04-25 22:20:39,wallstreetbets,It’s up about 200% over the last 2 years. Calm your tits and enjoy the ride
2021-04-26 11:35:51,wallstreetbets,AMD is not a stock market darling like Tesla or Nvidia. They have to show continuous growth in their ERs to convince the street.
2021-04-26 15:18:15,wallstreetbets,They are in correlated industries yes. But its a stretch to say the earnings will benefit them. Thats not the case
2021-04-26 13:12:45,wallstreetbets,"Hold.  July is a good ways away, so you have some time on your side if AMD is flat  or dips a bit after earnings, but I expect them to rip.  The signs are all in TSMC earnings, their HPC division, which is basically AMD, grew 14% in Q1, and their 7nm revenue grew 25%, which AMD is their largest customer at that node.  AMD has been suffering because of worries about chip shortages and news about INTC and NVDA, but TSMC has been increasing wafer supply all last year, it doesn't add up why AMD is so low.

2021-04-26 13:53:36,wallstreetbets,"It's probably more historic than anything else.  Anyone whose been investing in the semi space for 30 years has been on this ride with AMD before (more than once, maybe).  In the days of Opteron, it all felt very similar, only for Intel to come roaring back and crush all the inroads AMD was finally making in the datacenter/server space.

Although, this is very different now, and it's not going to turn out the same way.

But, this is all just a lack of faith that AMD can maintain a competitive advantage.  And I think that presents a big opportunity to be long AMD."
2021-04-26 08:11:59,wallstreetbets,100 premium is cheaper because its further out of the money and depending on IV and time crunch
2021-04-26 09:13:10,wallstreetbets,"Closer to ITM Calls are better than OTM....but OTM are vastly cheaper with more potential to earn a huge payout if the stock exceeds the value.  I have mostly ITM Calls for less risk, my 100c are cheap lotto Calls, if AMD hits big and Gamma squeezes, I could potential make vast amounts of money for not much cost, compared to my ITM Calls."
2021-04-26 08:09:23,wallstreetbets,IV can make options OTM worth profitable than options ITM depending on the premium you paid.
2021-04-26 10:50:56,wallstreetbets,"100 is cheaper. You can buy more 100s at $300 profit per option than you can 91s at $1,200 profit per option."
2021-04-26 05:03:07,wallstreetbets,burned!
2021-04-25 22:34:48,wallstreetbets,"If you already have shares, then hold em, but I think buying calls, even with earnings, is risky, because there's some reason they've hit a stop.

I don't know what it is, but unless they blow earnings out of the water, I don't think they'll take off past 100.

Obviously can be wrong about it, wouldn't be the first. But I've been fighting AMD for like 6mo now hoping it'd break triple digits."
2021-04-26 06:38:07,wallstreetbets,You misunderstand pricing. The price should correspond all future earnings discounted. So the pricing today is expectations of tomorrow. So the market cant expect it will be worth a 100 billion in the future if todays price does not reflect so
2021-04-25 22:33:38,wallstreetbets,"Got it, thank you!!"
2021-04-25 22:52:44,wallstreetbets,"I see, thank you. I guess the safest play is to buy calls on stocks that have high expectations from earnings reports and then sell on the day of."
2021-04-26 02:49:26,wallstreetbets,Mine are $83 puts. Playing earnings is dangerous though. I prefer sitting them out. That's why I'm closing on my puts tomorrow/Monday. Go with your gut feeling.
2021-04-26 16:15:32,wallstreetbets,"I meant more a good earnings report would be good for AMD, which in turn would be good for other stocks that move with AMD’s momentum. It’s not my original idea I’m parroting a couple different articles as I said before."
2021-04-26 16:17:01,wallstreetbets,I shouldn’t have been so specific I’m just excited about MVIS rn
2021-04-26 13:16:14,wallstreetbets,"That’s exactly what I’ve been thinking. It’s a great chance to get some free cash. Been buying every dip I can. Hoping we breach 100 by mid/late May, that would be a nice payday for me. Good luck brother"
2021-04-26 06:01:14,wallstreetbets,*Incinerated!* ^Dust
2021-04-26 00:22:36,wallstreetbets,That’s my plan. Got 20 calls at the dip on Thursday at close. Ill prob sell Tomorrow or Tuesday .
2021-04-26 16:25:52,wallstreetbets,Or maybe your are just trying to get attention to your own position. It has nothing to do with AMD
2021-04-26 16:26:37,wallstreetbets,Go be that elsewhere
2021-04-26 00:39:34,wallstreetbets,"Okay cool, thanks for sharing!!"

2021-04-25 20:55:23,wallstreetbets,Yes....I’m 50% OXY and 50% PPA
2021-04-25 20:52:36,wallstreetbets,Cotton?
2021-04-26 00:55:34,wallstreetbets,"i think you can't go wrong with anything in oil these days. Though I'd prefer some of the smaller Canadian players. I think they're more undervalued and many have better balance sheets. I'm YOLO'd GXE/GENGF (Gear Energy). At $60 WTI making 30%+ Free Cash Flow... debt free by end of this year or early next. Followed by stock buy backs. 

If looking for a larger company I'd pick SU (Suncor). Some other small companies : MEG, BTE, etc."
2021-04-26 02:40:15,wallstreetbets,How are they financially? They were on the brink of collapse mid pandemic. They are also part of the carbon capture trend. So maybe a revival?
2021-04-26 03:54:35,wallstreetbets,"I see that you are still keeping OXY warrants - **OXYWS**, great."
2021-04-26 04:43:39,wallstreetbets,I’m in XOM shares 👍🏼 just over $350k
2021-04-26 07:58:37,wallstreetbets,I take my Oxy everyday. They make me feel warm and fuzzy inside. This looks like a buy to me
2021-04-26 12:44:51,wallstreetbets,"Glad to see someone made some tendies on this company.  I lost a shitload last year trying to bounce off the bottom.  It eventually did bounce, after I lost all my money."
2021-04-26 13:45:39,wallstreetbets,Im thinking about MRO
2021-04-26 14:34:18,wallstreetbets,A fellow oil Barron in the making huh. I too have oxy and holding. I bought at 24 and held until 30 and unloaded a little. I have calls $32 September and also chevron. When buffet bought Cvx it threw a lot of calls itm. I expect it to bounce to those highs again by August after the summer of sodomah and Gomorrah uses up more oil
2021-04-26 14:59:40,wallstreetbets,as a holder of 10000 warrants i agree with your thought process
2021-04-26 00:16:57,wallstreetbets,"Yeah ‘All In’ sure - Although,  this stonk is not going terrible, but I’ve been holding a whole seven shares + auto dividend fractions for over a year.

2021-04-26 03:57:11,wallstreetbets,"I bought **OXY** by $15 last year, but sold out all my shares and warrants couple months ago."
2021-04-26 00:45:01,wallstreetbets,Clearly doesn’t know what “all in” means
2021-04-26 13:40:22,wallstreetbets,I take Oxycodone
2021-04-26 16:41:33,wallstreetbets,Not too late to buy some more! :P
2021-04-25 21:17:35,wallstreetbets,I recommend mods check user history
2021-04-26 08:44:10,wallstreetbets,Still working on buying more this week and possibly sell all ET and buy OXY
2021-04-25 20:15:15,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been heavy in the oil sector for the last decade (401k) . Essentially,  I have not made shit the last 10 years and kept averaging down.  Now, we could see $100 barrel."
2021-04-25 22:36:27,wallstreetbets,Best of luck to us! :D
2021-04-26 11:19:30,wallstreetbets,"First ask yourself if you think oil is going to skyrocket in price over the next few years. If you don’t, don’t buy oil companies. If you do, buy oil companies with high debt. Think about it. Debt means nothing if the price of the thing you sell goes up 5X"
2021-04-25 22:19:05,wallstreetbets,That's the point.  They go up much faster as the oil proce goes up and down much faster too.  In any case even with the debt payments they have a breakeven of 38 bucks a barrel.  They are drowning in free cash flow.  Compare that with Exxon who is at like 50 bucks breakeven.  I've been long Oxy since 10.50 a share.  The balance sheet is healthier now than before the pandemic and before they were trading at 41 buck a share.  They have tons of room to run.
2021-04-26 09:13:15,wallstreetbets,Buying out anadarko was a mistake when they took on all their debt
2021-04-26 08:13:35,wallstreetbets,Best of luck to ET!
2021-04-26 08:04:23,wallstreetbets,Yep Oils are so undervalue! I’m only familiar with SU in these u mentioned but agreed SU is also great!
2021-04-26 08:15:09,wallstreetbets,"They are good financially from my perspective now. Debts are safe, it’s more of a leverage now with the current oil price"
2021-04-26 06:14:14,wallstreetbets,"If you think it’ll move up a lot in the next seven yrs, warrants are basically option like leverage w a very very long expiration date"
2021-04-26 10:21:09,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I got them from dividend last year and just gonna hold it until OXY gets up to $50 - $60 and sell it. Buying the warrant is also a good play since it doesn't expire until 2027, It's less risky then regular 2 years option from my perspective."
2021-04-26 08:06:42,wallstreetbets,Best of luck to both of us!
2021-04-26 08:07:18,wallstreetbets,Yep total a buy. I’m still buying more with these cash that I have!
2021-04-26 16:40:26,wallstreetbets,Sorry to hear that.

2021-04-26 10:20:05,wallstreetbets,What's your pt
2021-04-25 21:05:36,wallstreetbets,All oil companies wrote down all the last ten years of losses last year. Now the bad debts are gone and assets written down they will have massive profits the coming years.
2021-04-25 22:19:15,wallstreetbets,why not just go with the XOP? You get exposure to the smaller caps and lessen the risk.
2021-04-25 22:35:29,wallstreetbets,"Yep. With Oil being above 60, OXY is at a very healthy state in terms of debt. It's more of a leverage at this point to me."
2021-04-26 11:55:04,wallstreetbets,im all in on ET too.
2021-04-26 08:12:19,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely, I'm just looking for a little more torque hence the smaller company. Check out Eric Nuttall's 20APR21 tweet and chart on 2022 ev/cf @70 WTI for many of the canadian players:
https://twitter.com/ericnuttall?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor

You'll see a good list of names to investigate. Nutall just opened a large position in GXE/GENGF and I also like that Wilson Wang head of HFIR research is on the board of directors, but most of those names are great opportunities."
2021-04-26 18:40:14,wallstreetbets,"Thanks.  Oh well.  Not the first time I've been off on my timing, definitely won't be the last."
2021-04-25 22:33:26,wallstreetbets,"Yep, looking forward to it! :D"
2021-04-25 22:48:46,wallstreetbets,From your mouth to the WSB gods ears !
2021-04-26 07:23:18,wallstreetbets,"OPEC+ shoots itself in the head by turning on the tap. Nearly all major oil-producing nations balance their budgets via oil revenues. If they flood the market, they get fucked Gaddafi-style."
2021-04-25 22:34:27,wallstreetbets,I'm using pre-covid stock price as a benchmark and OXY is still farthest away from it (more growth potential) compare to others.
2021-04-26 08:14:28,wallstreetbets,Will do. Thanks!
2021-04-26 08:07:42,wallstreetbets,"That's why they're gonna turn on the tap just enough to fuck US shale and not shoot themselves in the head. That's been the game since march 2020. End of production cuts starts in may, guess we'll see."
2021-04-25 20:03:23,wallstreetbets,"What about all the power to run them fans? Every power source available emits carbon if you take the production process into consideration (eg solar panels). Not saying it won't work cause it does, just questioning the effectiveness and profitability of it. Especially for a company like oxy with a 40b debt and probably soon to be carbon taxed on the oil segment."
2021-04-26 08:19:36,wallstreetbets,"But how does that affect OXY, which has some of the best acreage in the Permian with break even costs in the low 30s? 

For some context, SA has a fiscal break even at 65$+, while Russia is at ~41-42$ a barrel."
2021-04-25 20:16:21,wallstreetbets,"Im just discussing the technology not the company, OXY is in a lot of debt and has to prove they can get out of debt plus have growth potential in all their segments

only exxon and chevron support carbon tax, oxy and every other O&G company wants carbon credits, but it’s still a battle between two huge giants vs everyone else

the European fans currently max out at 4000 MT of carbon annually and the OXY fans do 1 million MT of carbon annually, and once it’s decoupled from the oil extraction process I believe it does have legs"

2021-04-25 23:30:11,wallstreetbets,"Pro tio here for when you're living under a bridge: Ok so if you really to get drunk for cheap then get some Lysol and spray it on bread, then eat the bread.  The Lysol high in alcohol content, but spraying in on bread is a convenient way to consume it while limiting how fast you can do so.  This keeps the bad chemicals in it from killing you faster than normal street alcohol would."

I put in a relatively small amount and I am startinng to think I might lose that entire amount. I put more into Aphira and Tilray and I am getting absolutely crushed on both of those. However, after the merger and whenever the US legalizes, I think those 2 are in a much better spot for me to regain the losses. Regardless, I really believed once Biden got elected all of these would rise and yet they have all gotten crushed."

Once I’m back up where I’m happy, I’ll get back into sundial, I think it will definitely come back up sooner than later. I also believe people dumped it for other stocks to get rich quick with and we were left to foot the Bill."

2021-04-26 18:05:06,wallstreetbets,really? I kind of feel like  Sundial is one of the worst ones out of the Cannabis stocks but I hope I am wrong. What are your thoughts on Aphria/Tilray?
2021-04-26 15:13:51,wallstreetbets,Upnips
2021-04-26 19:21:10,wallstreetbets,"Sundial has $719 million in cash and can also buy other companies to expand. They are trying to get away from wholesale and move towards branded retail. If they can get the right marketing down it will take off. 
Aphria and Tileay are merging, since Aphria seems to be in trouble financially. Tilray’s fourth quarter was also lower this year vs last years. These two stocks may be merging, but they seem to have tapped out financially and won’t be growing like Sundial has the potential to. At the moment, the sky is the limit for sundial to figure out which way they are going and nail it. If they do, then that’s a larger profit. 
I see sundial to have more room to grow in the next two years, since it looks like legalizing cannabis won’t happen in 2021, but maybe in 2022, and Aphiria and Tilray have already reached their max at the moment, doesn’t look like they have room for gains. My guess, is that by the end of 2021, more talks about legalizing cannabis will happen and Sundial will have better footing of what products they will sell here and their stock will take off again, but it won’t until we legalize here."

Frank Hamlin, who resigned as chief customer officer in March, had restricted shares valued at $33.5 million as of Friday.

The company's merchandising chief Chris Homeister, who is planning to leave the company, has 289,000 restricted shares valued at around $43.6 million as of Friday.

Former GameStop finance chief James Bell had restricted shares of $43.6 million as of Friday.

Shares of video game retailer GameStop Corp. as well as other heavily-shorted stocks such as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE: AMC) and BlackBerry Ltd. (NYSE: BB) skyrocketed in January amid a rally fueled by retail traders belonging to the subreddit channel r/WallStreetBets. The traders bid up the stocks to create a short squeeze.

GameStop's shares jumped last week after its CEO said he would leave before the end of July.

On April 13, the company said it is redeeming senior notes worth $216.4 million due in two years, a move that would leave the company mostly debt-free."

2021-04-25 21:57:50,wallstreetbets,If anything that should tell you they are more than safe
2021-04-25 21:58:23,wallstreetbets,Probably. There’s a solid chance of that one squeezing.

2021-04-26 03:04:57,wallstreetbets,Why because he's an alien?  I'm sure his species is planning for an invasion soon.
2021-04-26 00:02:26,wallstreetbets,Fuck it margins being turned on 🤪🤪
2021-04-26 00:02:09,wallstreetbets,You haven't made shit until you sell it.

2021-04-25 23:09:22,wallstreetbets,"I grew a beard because I was going bald, felt like it balanced things out"
2021-04-25 23:11:55,wallstreetbets,"I have a beard because hair grows on my face pretty fast and I don’t like shaving all the time, but my chin could stand to be a bit stronger."
2021-04-26 01:17:07,wallstreetbets,The dumbest thing about playing $TSLA earnings is that there's never any real surprise.  They update so damn frequently that everybody pretty much knows a week in advance what the numbers are going to be.
2021-04-26 01:18:25,wallstreetbets,"Yea, but it worked spectacularly those two or three times in 12 years right?"
2021-04-26 06:14:07,wallstreetbets,"upvoted for dreams can't be buy, didn't expect to see it here lol"

2021-04-25 22:21:01,wallstreetbets,"Dude just be honest and contact them. All this ""game"" shit is retarded. If you like someone let them know."
2021-04-25 22:19:57,wallstreetbets,"Dude same thing happened to me last year, in July I went on a date and hung with the girl from 2pm to like 10pm, she expressed during the date that she loved being with me, never heard from her after lol it happens to the best of us"
2021-04-25 22:20:46,wallstreetbets,Call her
2021-04-25 22:41:34,wallstreetbets,"Well there is a couple things. 1. There is Someone who is better than and more important to her than you. As to which who cares dont beat yourself up over it. Women will come and go. 2. Shes legit busy. Let it go and wait. 3. Caught up in work and getting a project done/sundays a “myself” day for her. 

Chill dude and relax. It will ethier go your way or it wont. Hope it will go your way and move on. Dont be a bitch who had a great time but demands closure/a convo to move on. She will come around and contact you if and when she wants. By the way i hope the best for you!"
2021-04-25 22:25:53,wallstreetbets,You know where she lives? Show up where she lives. Do the Cusack thing w the boombox.

2021-04-26 00:10:07,wallstreetbets,It’s called Wall Street Bets not investing
2021-04-26 00:09:43,wallstreetbets,Except calls on QQQ or SPY are usually the play.
2021-04-26 00:12:12,wallstreetbets,"I really don't understand this. SPY/QQQ is almost always going up, and via spreads you don't really even have to eat the premium to breakeven. Playing tickers it's so easy to get beta-fucked, where one random ticker having a good day can carry QQQ."
2021-04-26 00:10:49,wallstreetbets,FDs will make your dick fly off when they go in the money that’s why

2021-04-25 20:30:48,wallstreetbets,"I want to talk to a FOREX trader, I can’t imagine the amount of coke and risk needed"
2021-04-25 20:31:15,wallstreetbets,"I just traded R2K futures for $2050 profit. Bought at 2268, sold at 2272.1.

2021-04-26 00:10:22,wallstreetbets,"Beginner warning. Monthlies are the biggest trap out there, and it fools newbies all the time. They’re too short dated to recover if things go sideways, yet they’re also too expensive to use just for a quick yolo. You’re basically buying in at the exact moment the theta curve peaks.

Go 2/3+ months out minimum for longer term plays and under 2 weeks for yolos."
2021-04-26 00:05:21,wallstreetbets,Stonks only go down when you buy

Like, when everyone in the discussion is freaking out, that's usually a good time to buy a call.  Usually."
2021-04-26 01:21:08,wallstreetbets,Oh I fux with it.

2021-04-25 20:32:30,wallstreetbets,It always amazes me that people keep so much in the stock market knowing something like this is inevitably going to happen. And possibly soon. Is it just the rush of making money?
2021-04-25 21:12:28,wallstreetbets,I think May and June will be rough

2021-04-25 20:16:57,wallstreetbets,"Yeap. Because the only comments allowed were geared towards making money. Even on the weekends: if it didn’t make money (or lose it) it didn’t make sense. 

But the newbies complained about the big bad mods who wouldn’t let them talk about absolute fucking garbage which had no insight into making money or making moves in the market. Didn’t matter what it was, just had to be market related. But the new people bitched too much so now that shit is here and it poisoned the place."

Which could well end up affecting the US again. If ABNB makes it to the other side stronger there’s a decent bull case. On the other hand they are a cash furnace and boomer stocks have been beating the pants off tech lately. I’m staying away until we get more green on the screen.

I was so ashamed that I scrubbed it clean for like 25 minutes but I still couldn’t give it back to my sister cause I mean y’know, so I smeared peanut butter on her face and gave it to the dog."

2021-04-26 04:29:27,wallstreetbets,Depends.  What's the quality of work? What if the guy producing 15 averages 5-10 rejects that don't meet quality control per 100 he produces while the guy producing 12 only has 1 reject per 100?  Who is better?  Maybe the guy is slower because he's producing a higher quality product on average? Producing more isn't always better if it greatly increases the sigma of your results.
2021-04-26 04:30:21,wallstreetbets,"Depends on what the quantity produced by the average worker is. If 12 is still above the average or break even point then no, but 15 should have incentives to it. Some places pay employees based on work done instead of hours worked meaning the sky is the limit for the employee to make money but at the same time means they can not just sit around or slack off on work and expect pay."

There's some algo hedge funds out there which are incredibly impressive.  Renaissance really sticks out.  These are run/designed by incredibly intelligent people.

Sounds totally reasonable. With all the talk of smart beta etc. there are clearly a lot of people who want more risk than a 1x lever, and costs of leverage are indeed much higher to retail investors than to institutions.

>the portfolio can run gross exposure up to 15 times and will typically be around nine times.

2021-04-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD: DMTK - Short Interest Greetings you fools,  

Wanted to share my due diligence in a company I heavily believe in. 

DermTech (DMTK) focuses on non-invasive skin disease diagnostics, particularly skin cancer. Current standard for diagnosing skin cancer is to take a surgical lesion biopsy, which is an inherently invasive and unwelcoming process. DermTech has pioneered a new way to test for skin cancer through a non-invasive patch which is 99% accurate. This process cuts the cost of your standard biopsy testing by 25%. No cut needed. I came across this company while looking for undervalued buys in Q4 of 2020 and continue to add because I believe this will become a new adopted standard. DermTech has recently entered into an agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield in Texas to use their product as an in-network option for melanoma testing. 

Better yet, they do not require any FDA approval. 

From the May 2020, S-1 filing-

""We have not obtained regulatory approvals from the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for any of our tests as we operate a clinical laboratory under the CLIA guidelines and believe our tests are laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, that are not currently being regulated by the FDA.""

Now, I’m sick of these short-sellers going after companies with amazing fundamentals, products, and processes. My goal is to predict trends, and I’m confident that genomics will be an industry dominate trend 5-10 years from now, maybe sooner. This company is heavily shorted with a short float of 23.64%, and I honestly couldn’t tell you where the opposition is grounded. 

**My opinion:** Genomic medicine will lead us into a world in which we will easily understand what health conditions we are at risk for. Moving from a system in ‘which we fix you after you are sick’, to one ‘in which we know what you are going to become sick with and preventing accordingly’, will turn the global medical industry “upside-down.”

I've completely YOLO'd my savings on this company, wish me luck, or don't, fuck you."

2021-04-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Viacom CBS DD So bear with me cuz this is the first time I have ever pulled back the curtain from lurking to actually step up with my own contribution to the community... so let’s just get right to it my fellow crayon munchers, we all know about the Archegos fund meltdown and what it did to big ticket holding like DISCA and VIAC. 

Now obviously after seeing drops like they went thru no one wants to touch these stocks with a 10 foot pole, until now. These stocks massive sell off has created a huge opportunity for another bull run on Viacom since it is now undervalued by about $15 or about ~25% increase in the stock price as it currently sits. Conservative fair value estimates put the price target for VIAC at around $55 while some of the more bullish analysts price targets I have seen are sitting at $69 which would give it an upside of 42.0% (coincidence? I think not). Anyways all things aside the sell off has basically put a top performing stock on firesale with a huge upside that wall st has just started to see in the past couple weeks as it was up 8.24% this past week. 

While I know alot of you apes see gains under 10% and are like so what who the fuck cares if its not 70% intraday gains like GAMESTONK or MVIS, to which I say fair enough keep sewering your money on weekly FDs if you please (I am still long GME with shares don’t crucify me for looking for other opportunities as well). However, if there are any apes out there who are looking for some longer term safe plays with decent returns look no further, Viacom is a massive media conglomerate with rock solid financials, stellar management team and solid business model, their shift to streaming orientation is going to really boost their growth and kickstart what I believe will be the comeback of the year forsure. Position 1000 shares at $38.40 lets go to the moon boys, you saw what Archegos did to the stonk lets show em why the planet of the apes is just as powerful!

TLDR: VIAC is on fucking firesale right now because of Archegos sell off and Wall st is just now seeing the opportunity for a comeback, this is a hugely profitable company that is a healthy safe bet which is set to head back towards its previous levels in the next year so expect upwards of 20% growth by mid year.

Look at the revenues made in the last 4 years for every single broadcasting company. They even state that most of their revenue is from political revenue on their filings

Just because you’re somehow butthurt about politics for some reason doesn’t make the facts incorrect. DD on a stock can include politics, whether you want it to or not. Some companies are involved with news, and news makes money from ads, and ads make more money when more people watch it more, and people watch more tv when it’s interesting tv, and US politics was interesting the last 4 years. .

2021-04-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$FSR Bear Update Hi! Me again 🌈🐻, if you didn't see my first two posts ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maa6g3/fsr_is_worth_0_a_share/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/melf8c/fsr_updated_price_target_421/)), I have serious doubts about Fisker as a company.   Just wanted to pop back in with a couple updates.  My goal of these posts is to make sure that anyone investing in this company has a full grasp of the risks.  In their 10K that was (finally) filed, I grabbed two important pieces of information that I hadn't really discussed in depth.   I'll try to keep this short this time.

**Manufacturing Agreement:**

First, is that the reported deal with Magna International to manufacture the Ocean is not actually finalized.  It's more of an memorandum of understanding with a basic outline of terms.  So, the clock is ticking on their Q4 2022 production date, and they still don't have detailed terms with the manufacturer.  Who is also supposed to be performing the majority of the engineering, design, and testing of the car itself.

Might want to get moving on that.

**Manufacturing Agreement Terms:**

The terms of the above agreement are that Magna will get a series of warrants for FSR stock that are exerciseable upon three main milestones: (1) preliminary production spec, (2) detailed manufacturing agreement, (3) start of production. If fully exercised, these warrants amount to 6% ownership in Fisker.

Let that sink in.  If Magna produces a single Ocean, they own 6% of the company.  This (maybe?) makes sense for a long term strategic partnership, but Fisker has already announced that they want Foxconn to make their second car.  How much ownership does Foxconn get?  And if they make a third car?  Does everyone just get 6%?  So of course Magna made that deal.  No downside risk, and the upside is 6% of an EV company.

&#x200B;

As I said in a comment on my previous post,  I""ll be keeping an eye on May.  They had announced they'd have a production version of the Ocean ready for the LA Auto Show that was supposed to be in May 2021.  The show has been moved to November (Covid-19), but it will be telling if they debut a production ready Ocean on that original timeline, or if dates are already slipping.

I don't think this company leadership has any idea what it's doing.

&#x200B;

Current Positions: None.  Intend to scale into puts if the price moves higher, but right now it's just in a slow bleed/consolidation that burns Theta."

2021-04-26 13:51:03,wallstreetbets,">Unfortunately, they broke down after \~40 miles and a homebrew EV truck using Nissan Leaf parts went significantly farther than them.

aren't we supposed to use facts?  The lordstown buggy didn't 'break down', they ran out of juice faster than expected due to the super soft sand.  That was a screw-up, a miscalculation, and a cluster-fuck, but it wasn't a break-down.

the shitbox was put together by a team that had run the course several times in the past and used 7 battery pack change-outs to get as far as they did.  they also thought that they had enough juice to complete, but the course conditions were so  bad that even the ICE entrants were portaging fuel into the back country and borrowing fuel from other teams due to way higher than expected fuel consumption.

yeah, i'm long on ride, you caught me."
2021-04-26 13:58:18,wallstreetbets,"Even if everything you just said was accurate, the negative perception to losing (badly) to a shit box is significant.

As to what you said, the course is ~250 miles and they made it ~40 miles.  Additionally, their average speed was ~17 miles per hour.  They drove the thing like a baby and only made it ~40 miles.  There's no way to sugar coat that into a positive.

P.S. I'm long on $RIDE as well, I'm just not delusional."
2021-04-26 14:11:25,wallstreetbets,"not denying it was something of a shit-show, driving the wrong way on a course ffs... can't refute it gave a negative impression due to a lack of preparation, whatever the reasons for that.  Can't even contest that they drove conservatively compared to the ICE entrants designed from the tires up to handle the course.  It was never the goal to beat it to death to make spectators happy.  Of course, a better result would have been .. better.

That said, its not 'sugar coating' to merely make a statement that they did not break down.  Its just a statement of fact, it is an opinion to speculate what that means going forward and how it affected investor sentiment etc.

if you can point out where i'm delusional, i'd appreciate the free psychoanalysis"
2021-04-26 14:31:33,wallstreetbets,"Firstly, you continue to defend the shit show.

Secondly, you are taking them at face value that nothing broke.  

Given they talked this event up big time and implied their goal was to finish the course, how in the world can you believe they simply ran out of battery after 40 miles?  (especially given their pace)

Surely they didn't think they could go 250 miles on one charge; therefore, they would have had a charging plan, right?  If they simply ran out of battery, why didn't they charge it?  

Instead they sat ""dead"" in the same spot for ~2.5 hours and then gave it up.  

Sorry, that doesn't sound like ""we miscalculated our range"" and sounds a lot more like something broke.  

Bonus points for running a vehicle called ""Endurance"" in an endurance race and breaking down ~40 miles in.  

They would have been far better off not even starting the race to be honest.  They could have came up will all sorts of excuses.  (E.g. have the vehicle shipping the cars to baja ""break down""....)  Something... Anything....

2021-04-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Broadband Supremacy: Musk and Bezos fire shots in broadband star wars. The Tesla billionaire is riling rivals as he launches satellites to beam down internet access 
2021-04-25 20:16:39,wallstreetbets,"There's already a company that's signed with and backed by some of the biggest telecom names in the world. 

ASTS if you haven't heard of them. They've been down lately due to PIPE selling post merger, but their tech is launching soon en masse. 

Less than 40ms or so latency has been proven and documented with their satellites. Their plan is to help supplement major phone and internet providers, not compete. You can think of their tech as an amplifier for internet for any spot in the world that doesn't have high speed internet. Best part is your phone doesnt have to do anything to use their satellites. 

I'm curious if Starlink plans to work with or compete against ASTS, but either way the company is criminally undervalued.

Position: 1000 shares, 12.00-ish average"
2021-04-25 20:37:50,wallstreetbets,"I am in the Starlink Beta, and it's fucking amazing for being a beta.  Serious upgrade from DSL or slower providers.  Competes with cable internet speeds.  So far in beta it's great for large upload/download jobs (like streaming) and general internet use.  It's ""ok"" for connectivity intensive stuff like online games or zoom calls - there will be a drop or two a day on that kind of stuff that needs a constant connection.  I'm guessing this happens when it switches up satellites.  In theory this should improve as more satellites are launched.

Anyhow, it's impressive tech and I can absolutely see this taking over the internet access world to anyone outside of urban city limits that doesn't have access to good fiber/cable internet."

2021-04-26 04:27:51,wallstreetbets,"While nice for the future satellite internet should be unnecessary just like satellite phones. Unfortunately the USA is a third world country with a politically powerless dictatorship that's more interested with lining it's pockets than doing anything, so satellites might be the only way to get around utility monopolies written into the law itself even after ISPs stole literally hundreds of billions of taxpayer money and didn't do anything they were supposed to."

2021-04-26 12:13:14,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think you understand how starlink works. It is extremely sensitive to obstructions in the direct line of sight between the receiver and the satellite (obviously) because it uses laser light to communicate. This has nothing to do with FSD. You can’t even use it under a tree. But it’s pointless telling you this...you will yolo your money anyway at the chance to cuck for Elon. Godspeed I guess, you’ll probably do as well as any other retard"

2021-04-25 21:59:33,wallstreetbets,"Competition can breed more progress than cooperation.

If Bezos and Musk joined together, they would have to compromise on their individual visions and would have less drive to work hard.

edit: If you want a real example, the ULA is exactly what you proposed. Boeing and Lockheed Martin joining forces. Its had poor results because individual contracts are more interested in extracting more money than in furthering joint goals."
2021-04-25 22:00:31,wallstreetbets,"> its annoying that capitalism doesn't work so well on a massive scale

It works better than anything else. The problem with all economic systems is that they are run by people and people suck. Capitalism generally handles our faults the best."
2021-04-25 20:05:37,wallstreetbets,"Elon works because he's got a joined up vision, the thing is it's not a very democratic way to decide the future but he's fuckin doing it anyway. I don't personally agree with giving this much governance to companies... but capital is outgrowing governance so... He also has a backdoor into the massive venture capital group looking to plunder the deep-sea for rare earth minerals and battery metals, and I wouldn't be surprised if Bolivia was in some way entangled in his new geopolitical landscape with the tussles going on there. 

So I don't follow his vision 100%. I don't think the EU does either, I'm yet to see his fantastic battery recycling plan for dealing with the huge amount of E-waste that's going to emerge from his lithium revolution... until then despite respecting the mans tenacity I still prefer hydrogen because it uses simple steel, doesn't risk as much long scale contamination, and is free of the geopolitical bullshit of scarce element supplies (ok a bit of natural gas whilst the infrastructure develops...)"
2021-04-26 10:47:57,wallstreetbets,"Starlink satellites will all fall out of the sky in 5 years. No long term mess.

ASTS satellites are huge enormous nets. If they lose control they will become massive fucking targets.

At higher orbits dead satellites become space junk for millennia. Starlink isn’t a problem, everyone proposing higher-orbit satellites is a problem."
2021-04-26 10:49:29,wallstreetbets,"The US is a low-density country. It’s unfair to complain about US rail, or telecommunications infrastructure without accounting for how fucking huge the US is. Most European countries are the size of individual states."
2021-04-25 21:51:41,wallstreetbets,"From what I gather, Starlink can’t operate in densely populated areas due to the limitations of satellite. I wonder if they can ever overcome this technological density issue. Until then I think T and the other major telecoms are pretty safe."

2021-04-26 01:47:47,wallstreetbets,4g and 5g allows you to connect to the internet. It accomplishes both things due to... the way it is. I'm not really sure I'm following what you're getting at.
2021-04-26 04:09:03,wallstreetbets,You can get 4g routers so dont see the problem. The real big driver for ASTS will be IOT in my opinion.

2021-04-26 00:06:52,wallstreetbets,"That's the thing, AT&T basically has a rural monopoly in the Southeast. It will suffer from starlink, especially after they've had time to get the density up to the point medium to large towns can start using it."
2021-04-26 10:52:14,wallstreetbets,"Hopefully when they lose their rural customers to Musk, they bleed weak enough for Google to come in with Fiber."
2021-04-26 05:13:16,wallstreetbets,If every star link receiver nearby could communicate with each other they could probably solve that issue with routing. But I don't think they do that.

Nobody is losing sleep over Musk, good on you though letting everybody know you have chronic issues with projection.

And yes, there is no revolutionary innovation made by Musk apart from improving current tech (with his team), the world has already done wonders before Musk came along, and will continue to do so after he is gone, even if we can no longer have more of his very innovative™️ LED tunnels.

2021-04-26 06:57:42,wallstreetbets,It was a national initiative that’s the sad bit. Then the companies just stole all the subsidies and didn’t deliver in their promises.

Even though I literally only pointed out how your previous comment had no substance because your only counter was playing a grammar nazi ”LoLz hE sHifT No WorK” and not what was being discussed here. Congratulations on proving my point, now go wash your ass.

Also, good for you."
2021-04-26 12:45:27,wallstreetbets,We are in wsb you fucking neck. There was absolutely no substance to the discussion at hand other than that guy (I now assume you're them on a different account) is insanely jealous of a billionaire. At no point did I suck off Elon on this comment thread. Seems you're the one projecting. I bet you're a manlet.
2021-04-26 13:18:04,wallstreetbets,"Yes, because everyone knows that when your only counter argument to criticism is spamming the j-word like an NPC, that is the sign of an intellectual who definitely is not investing all their waking hours worshipping a figure and their ”money”, that’s pretty contradictory for someone who ”doesn’t care so much about a billionaire” yet you get mad and assume things that were not being mentioned. Have the audacity to tell me that it is not cult behavior when the only ones who care about billionaire status (keyword ”billionaire” aka money) are the ones who follow one like a herd. Because clearly pointing out the errors in Musk’s actions, which there are countless of by now and the over exaggerated high praise he gets for basically things means that I’m the one who thinks about the moneyz and not the one who pulled that out of thin air because their god is not as wholesum funni as they think he is, and that also means I’m the one projecting somehow 😳, funny how that works. Most other celebrities have been cancelled for way less than Musk, but these mfs are still losing losing sleep over money, you should start losing sleep over the definition of ”projection” and catch some self-awareness on the side.

But I’m sure at the end of the day, you are very busy trying to advance society™️ by contributing thoughtful insight and discussion as much as you lot think you care about doing it. If you pull that bullshit on your dog next time, he might be the one who eats it up."

You're just projecting your jealousy."
2021-04-26 13:37:47,wallstreetbets,"”I don’t think he is as good as people think”

”You are just jealous”

Did the part about having nothing other than accusing everyone of being jealous go over your head? Lmao and then you say ”thaT isn’T me11!”, yes I am the one projecting."

Cash flow is the lifeblood of a business. It doesn't matter how innovative their product 'will' be, if they can't meet the costs of R&D they're fucked. They get stuck in a loop of constant debt financing or stock issues and most don't even have a end product as they run out of money."

This is regarding all stocks not MVIS in particular. If you put in a limit order with a price you think is fair for the stock then don’t worry about it, if you put in a market order you’re going to pay whatever it opens at."

If I double down and it tanks I lose a sweet profit. If you buy in now you'll probably realize one. Tell you what you throw that 200$ in and I'll sell shitty old CLOV and bump up my average a couple bucks. Nice if it dropped a couple bucks at open for us.

Avg is 16.70$, I think we're going to 27$ today. Gonna keep my stop loss two bucks below current price until it tanks or Friday, that's when a lot of fellows reckon it'll moon. Congrats, good choice, good luck."

There is a chance, that the therapies will be used without knowing much about the off-targets, but then it should(?) require many long-term studies and patients before releasing it (but I don't know, how loosely the fda will handle that).

2021-04-26 00:30:53,wallstreetbets,"Part of the reason some companies developing self-driving cars have not used LiDAR is due to cost. A cost-efficient LiDAR would change that because LiDAR has better range and resolution and isn’t subject to weather conditions. 

But LiDAR is important for more than self-driving cars. There are other autonomous vehicles, like drones, and tons of applications from military, agriculture, home security, and beyond. Whether or not you want to invest in MVIS or any other LiDAR company doesn’t really matter, but your understanding of LiDAR as a technology appears limited."
2021-04-26 06:15:27,wallstreetbets,"Even the 2 minute hype video, all we have for MVIS is all about cars.  And that's literally all they have showed the public so far.  Beyond that we know nothing.  All that you mentioned is nice but the real reason billions have been poured into LiDAR, a crowded field is SDC's.

Also let's not act like MVIS has been in the LiDAR game from the start like all the other LiDAR companies.  They are relatively newcomers."
2021-04-26 09:54:32,wallstreetbets,"Your response seems odd to me. I didn’t try to “sell” MVIS’s LiDAR. I’m talking about LiDAR in general, and it’s clear from your response that your knowledge is extremely limited."

2021-04-26 05:42:08,wallstreetbets,"Uhm. I think you are overestimating how much ""china"" cares about a small stake in a shitty company in the middle of nowhere desert. Dont get me wrong i own a couple shares in MP only because i agree with the idea that steel prices should rise and this company has too many shares shorted.

 But. Making statements like:
>China is only the leader because their population bears the cost of production that will likely see boycotts or backlash

""China"" is not what you seem to think they are. China is a communist country. There's no such thing as boycotts. People boycott = they get killed. And then their family gets killed.

Do not let the press feed you bullshit that they are changing and becoming more democratic. They are becoming more profitable and more capitalistic. But their slaves *(oops, i meant employees) do not have the right to boycott."

They bought a telehealth company precisely to circumvent the whole Dr.'s office problem. They are not only developing several medical treatments, they are developing tech to deliver these treatments to as a wide a population as possible. Rahn's vision is to get the medicine where it is needed. He spoke about rural america where opioid addiction is severe. These areas don't have psychiatrists. Mind Medicine is not only seeking to treat these people but to take the medical professionals to them.

I don't think you did much research on this company.

From what I see basic bullish case is the fact that people may need hella booster vaccines as all of our MRNA shit appears to be a temporary solution and we may need a ""traditional vaccine"" to back it up.
On the bear side, basically everyone who wants a vaxx is getting one pretty quick here in the US and OCGN only has manufacturing and distribution rights in the US (although Bharat may expand that to the whole Western hemisphere which is my conjecture as they don't even have enough for India). Anyway looks like EUA application is imminent so I'm interested to see what you think about a short term EUA scalp versus a long term value play as they may get business manufacturing for 3rd world countries possibly on the US dollar"

> I'm just saying your thesis of them having some sort of blowout of  earnings has a flaw in that it's predicated upon something they don't  experience, and most of their sales are baked in because analysts  understand what their total production capacity is. 

thank u for replying and chiming in... Must be honest and concede just on the fact that i'm convinced your knowledge about the details on the subject is much greater than mine... On the other hand (and now in retrospect it is clear) i wish i decided not to wait for today thinking there might be a dip to go w my game plan... My  going all-in on AMD for upcoming ER was predicated, by a large part, on what i believe will be a very good ER (w upbeat guidance) which will result in run up in SP based on sentiment alone and, in addition, boosted by a dose of irrational exuberance just is appears to me investors are just looking for a valid (even if it is perceived as such) reason/excuse to run SP up to triple digits and from what i'd call SP decline fatigue in whole sector....

Was looking to get in close to $80 even a bit under but so far it doesn't look we'll see that SP anytime soon; now i will be thinking coz i def was not planning on $85... :)"

2021-04-26 01:00:18,wallstreetbets,"No.  That's a limitation on production capacity of the entire unit, not just the silicon itself.  You can't get a new GPU because they're excessively good at mining for the Devil's Gold (or rather, the Devil's Gold younger ghostly brother), not because there's a shortage of silicon.  It wouldn't matter if you handed EVGA 10 billion chips for 3080 cards, they would still only be able to make as many cards as they make.  If you look back to $NVDA's Pascal architecture for the 10 series GTX's, there were similar constraints based on production limitations; that wasn't a chip shortage.

&#x200B;

When we talk about chip shortages, we talk about destruction of fabrication capabilities in China and Malaysia on the commodity level of the sector.  There's a chip shortage because less chips are being made, not because demand is outstripping maximum supply."

2021-04-26 01:07:53,wallstreetbets,"You're correct that battery swapping stations COULD be feasible for short-haul and last-mile heavy duty transport (though it raises its own set of questions and problems).  Long haul I don't see it, just because of the infrastructure costs and the fact that it would basically be a mechanic service every few hundred miles, which can take significant time (unlike, say, $NIO, which can have you hot swapping a car battery in 5-10 minutes), but I posit to you this:

If we agree that batteries and swapping stations are not feasible for transcon transport or heavy machinery runs, and you're the purchaser for a transport fleet, which solution are you going to pick?

* One which part of your fleet is reliant upon batteries and swapping capabilities, putting your entire fleet at the mercy of continuous power delivery so those batteries can stay charged.....and then for part of your fleet, implementing a completely different solution for long-haul.  A solution which, consequently, also completely removes the flexibility to move your rigs between short haul and long haul functions based on current market conditions and ties you to a split fleet or
* One which your entire fleet is standardized upon a single fueling solution and will never be subject to the whims of weather, natural disasters or the like?

&#x200B;

And remember, right now everybody has a 1-product solution:  Diesel, so clearly they like simple.  Now, I'm not a logistics coordinator or supply line optimizer for a transport fleet, but if it were me, I'd go with the simpler one that gives me flexibility and allows me to control my own chain."

2021-04-26 07:11:11,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, you put things in order very well.

One solution that may have been overlooked is putting the batteries in the trailer. Most freight loads don't reach the max gross vehicle weight of 80k in the US. With drop and hook runs tractors can run on their own power for dead head miles and then plug into the trailer for the paid miles. Since the bobtail (unhitched tractor) is already swapping the entire trailer then charging can be accomplished while it's being loaded and or waiting on a lot. The extra time for drop and hook is already priced in. Likely no reason that the ev trailer cannot be used with ice power units other than opportunity cost.

I'm sure there is a reason why they haven't considered this as well and likely the same as you described above and also thank you for replying. If feel the wrinkle growing and I also feel really special.

Also feel a lot better about Cielo."

And USA already has orders for like 600 million vaccines from pfizer, moderna, etc. So, how many more of this new vaccine would they order? Do they have that many new variants in the USA?

Guess my perspective is different since I've held shares so long. Until the last few weeks with the spike in cases in India there wasn't really a question if bharat would be able to supply vaccine until ocugen got manufacturing set up in the US. That's totally changed now so there's a potential gap in actually having doses to supply if they get EUA in a few weeks.

2021-04-25 23:19:54,wallstreetbets,"Roku is just such a better way to play this trend. 

I mean these guys are really going to struggle to make money, and the only plan for making money relies on something that hasn’t happened yet. And guess what platform they really used to scale? It’s Roku. And you can bet your ass they’ll get a cut of whatever it is that Fubo does, along with every other competitor out there. 

Roku still has 10x opportunity, no doubt in my mind. Is it guaranteed? No, absolutely not. But I like their odds a hell of a lot better than a Fubo which will always be subject to the margin pressures of a commodity business."

2021-04-26 07:25:22,wallstreetbets,"Looks like a good bargain - esports, good user and revenue growth. Together with the short % it’s a no brainer. 

Need to get GME moonboy attention - cuz this has some serious potential to fly. 💯💯"
2021-04-26 09:36:34,wallstreetbets,"Glad you wrote such a through post on this man. I will summarize my thoughts on Huya too, which are pretty much the same as yours (I'm in 2,100 shares at 19.30 USD).

1. Huya became a ""value-gem"" about a month ago when all growth stocks dropped leading fears the FED would raise interests due to inflation. On top of that, we had China aiming to impose additional regulatory requirements for Chinese tech companies and the US requiring audited financials from Chinese corporates listed in American exchanges.
2. Last week Chinese regulators released the additional requirements platforms such as Huya would need to comply with. They happened to be negligible for a company like Huya. So, this is out of the bear case.
3. The ""Holding Foreign Companies Accountable"" act requires companies to comply within a 3-year timespan. This is more than enough time for Huya to comply and remain listed in America. I think all Chinese companies got punished and it did not take into account the ability for individual companies to actually comply and remain listed. Huya has huge  backing from institutional investors and I am sure they will find the way to comply with the requirements imposed by the HFAC.
4. Valuation is at about 2.5 P/S. However, you have to take into account a balance surplus of about 1.4billion currently sitting in their balance sheet. If we adjust the ratio to account for a 1.4billion surplus on their balance sheet, then the P/S would be at about 1.8. This is a HUUUGE bargain por a stock that's growing this fast.

For me this is a no brainer and the upcomings months will tell whether there is any sort of sanity in equity markets or there is none... This stock should be trading (much) higher."
2021-04-25 23:27:52,wallstreetbets,Been riding the HUYA train since $12. Went up to $36+ and sank. Still holding for the $200. 33k shares
2021-04-26 06:37:56,wallstreetbets,"I long HUYA and DOYU for long time, more than 1 year since 2020/3, finally I saw this perfect analysis from you. Really great job man! You can have a look at the stock position I have through my YOLO post. I have 45000 DOYU shares and 15000 HUYA shares, the avg cost of DOYU is about $5.2 and HUYA cost is $12.6, at the same time, I also hold some call units."

2021-04-26 15:09:32,wallstreetbets,"I’m super bullish on this stock. I originally bought at 19 last year and sold during the first run up to 36, because these gap ups tend to pull back a bit. After I rebought at 24 and doubled down at 18. Similar companies have 10x plus the valuation of what huya has, and not to mention value hyper growth stocks are super rare."

2021-04-26 09:04:59,wallstreetbets,"Analysts set the target for $23, and in February this stock was $33, high short,
 
public float close to outstanding shares, strong employee ownership, 

Morgan Stanley have 32% ownership which make them the biggest institutional owner with 26 M of shares.

In China, Huya are huge. I am an europoor and own American stocks, so what if Chinese people start to trade American stocks easily like in Europe? Huya will get more holders and it can 🚀🚀🚀"

2021-04-26 04:05:31,wallstreetbets,"HYPRO up 13,16% today! Hopefully some of you bought at open :) Pareto securities has a price target of 100NOK. Also since the IPO at 34NOK the future prospects of the company has gotten immensily better because of the new technology and partners.
HYPRO has their annual report on the 30th of April and because HYPRO has been very silent this spring I expect a rise in price when they tell about their plans for the future."

2021-04-26 05:57:09,wallstreetbets,"You’re welcome, I’m glad to hear that! Hypro is the one I’ve looked into the most and have the biggest position in. 

I think MP materials is an interesting bet. They provide 15% of the worlds rare earth elements that are used in renewable energy infrastructure and EVs and so on. I can only imagine the demand for these elements go up. Currently all elements are shipped to china to be processed but MP will soon start to process them in the US which should increase their share of the market. Here is their website: https://mpmaterials.com/what-we-do/"
2021-04-26 06:01:25,wallstreetbets,Also any ETF containing the big names in renewable energy should be a good long term investment. I can’t point out any single company.

2021-04-26 03:53:11,wallstreetbets,"The price of renewable energy and the efficiency of producing hydrogen has come down tremendously in 20 years so it’s more likely now. 
Also, we can’t act like fossil fuels are incredibly cheap. Drilling oil from under the seabed or shipping coal hundreds or thousands of miles is expensive stuff. Subsidies from governments are keeping the prices down. Renewable energy is often cheaper than fossil fuels but they can’t phase out fossil fuels alone because they need a way of storing energy. Many view hydrogen as the best way to do so. Hydrogen can also decorbonize industries like steel production and other industrial processes that require high temperatures which renewable energy alone can’t do.
Will it happen? Some of it will happen for sure but the extent of it is uncertain."

2021-04-26 08:42:02,wallstreetbets,I have seen a few analysts that follow TSLA very closely. Dudes on Youtube.  One that is pretty good thinks they could post non-GAAP of 90c - $1 ... Let us say we could project $4+ earnings for the next 12 months.  Where would that put the stock   @ 200x $800... So many $800 calls sold.  My gut says they will not allow this to go over $800 this Friday. Very interesting trying to predict price of this one based on the OPTIONS curve when the stock could really become attractive with the earnings some are expecting. Although my wager here is very small. I think I will just take it off and spectate on this one.

2021-04-25 23:41:38,wallstreetbets,Need a comment TL:DR
2021-04-26 03:16:52,wallstreetbets,"I've read this critique before and honestly if you don't understand why you wouldn't already see dropping MCRs in a rapidly growing Medicare Advantage provider then you just  don't understand the business model. The entire reason that Medicare has allowed this model is because it allows for better long term outcomes for patients by correctly incentivizing prevention of health issues. So of course you're not going to see the savings right now for a company that's rapidly growing, you're not seeing the savings down the line yet from the preventative effects of having intervened sooner. Getting your patient that colonoscopy now doesn't save money up front, it saves you money 5 or 10 years down the road when they don't have colon cancer. For a rapidly growing company almost all their patients are only now getting this preventative intervention because they're almost all new patients, so it's only several years from now where you'll start seeing significant cost reductions from the first batch of patients that joined years ago.

That's why it's a long term play. This critique is honestly complete idiocy. Maybe Clover's investor deck had a couple silly slides in it, but that doesn't change the legitimacy of this model in the long term.

I'm not saying this is some low risk investment, if you want that go buy Verizon shares for the 4% dividend or something. Maybe Clover won't manage to actually succeed. But I like the business model, I like the way the incentives are aligned with better healthcare outcomes, and frankly I like that there's a very real short squeeze opportunity since the short sellers have been overhyping the negatives and piled on far too much. There's no short term reason that Clover shares should continue to go down, they've got the Walmart partnership last year, they've gotten approval for a significant geographic expansion, and they just put Kouzoukas on the board. What's the thesis on why the stock would actually go down much further over the next 1 year?"

2021-04-26 10:23:03,wallstreetbets,I don’t have a savings account....but I have stonks!
2021-04-26 12:26:28,wallstreetbets,"Buy some puts if you're so sure, unless you know you're just being a salty whore. 

Do your dd btw, even Zacks rates it at $151 price target. Sub $100 ain't happening unless it gets shorted there, even then not for long.

But I'll come back to check on you in a few months and see how much you're enjoying eating your own words! Btw, crayons really help with the flavor.

I'm done arguing with you and feeding this nonsense. If you wanna take a deep breath and talk our your issues with someone I'll listen, I won't judge or mock you.

2021-04-25 20:28:14,wallstreetbets,"I know what you mean. I've done it multiple times. However, there is never a 100% security a dip is a dip. I mean the last couple weeks proved it. Sometimes after a dip it goes even lower. 

Still, you are talking like you easily make millions every day and I dont think that this is possible for a ""normal"" person. Dont mistake your luck with knowledge."
2021-04-25 20:42:25,wallstreetbets,"It must be that my last 15 day trades in the last 3 weeks have been luck, sorry you haven’t figured out any patterns in the last month. Nio and spy is all you need to trade right now, the dips are obvious patterns. My longer plays are shitting more than the day trades"

2021-04-25 21:37:55,wallstreetbets,No offense taken -- still learning options.  Just don't know what you mean by doing an 80 delta vs 40 delta.
2021-04-26 00:30:55,wallstreetbets,"Delta is part of Greeks, along with gamma, vega, theta, & iv drive black scholes for pricing options.

In it’s simplest terms, delta implies probability of the strike occurring. An at-the-money (ATM) strike has a 50 delta, meaning there’s a 50% chance the strike will stay in-the-money (ITM) at expiry"

I’ll post a yolo update later to show progress from today.

2021-04-25 20:24:48,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-04-26 12:53:53,wallstreetbets,It's mainly an excuss to recall your shares and trigger that sweet short squeeze.
2021-04-26 11:29:38,wallstreetbets,Ah okay sry I am german did not knew the word
2021-04-25 22:48:37,wallstreetbets,"If you think shorts covering at $150 would cause the price to skyrocket, what makes you think that shorts could cover while the price falls? They can't. Shorts covering would cause immense buying pressure making the price go up up up to the moon. It doesn't matter if they start covering at $10 or $1000. 

Also keep in mind we already went from $480 in Jan to $40 for most of February. Why didn't shorts cover then? Because no matter the price they can't cover without causing a massive squeeze."
2021-04-26 03:07:39,wallstreetbets,I voted based on how I liked their names
2021-04-26 09:49:34,wallstreetbets,"Any time you or I can buy a stock, they can buy a stock to cover a short. It's just a matter of how many they buy at once, and how long a period of time they have to do that over without spiking the price."

2021-04-26 11:22:36,wallstreetbets,"Great DD
And spot in with where zymergen and ginkgo will be.
Both will likely have great IPO and SPAC runs ups but will eventually fade and trade at accessible amounts.
Amyris is definitely ahead of the pack here, by 5 years as noted.
Look at the revenue and the leveraged sources of revenue, Amy is a beast and will continue her ascent to $30-50 this year.
Just wait for any news in the monoclonal antibodies project as well as other tricks up her sleeves. This will rocket."
2021-04-26 14:46:11,wallstreetbets,Aunt Kathy is all over on Zy and Ginkgo is valued at $20B. need to know what these other 2 are doing so different.
2021-04-26 14:47:31,wallstreetbets,It's just market awareness. I think Amy refuses to let Cathy see their pipeline while the other two are happy to provide it.
2021-04-26 18:44:52,wallstreetbets,Maybe she prefers a cleaner balance sheet? Amyris is in the middle of it's turn around.
2021-04-26 14:53:57,wallstreetbets,is this speculation or is there a way this can be verified?
2021-04-26 16:36:44,wallstreetbets,speculation. Also Amyris management needs to start delivering on its promises. It did borderline shady stuff to stay afloat.

Anything below $4 is an absolute steal for this company. If you take into account the chance that even one of their pipelines gets approved, which is incredibly high, your looking at a quick 5x from $4 => $20 (modest). I see them getting at least one approved in 2022/23 so holding long should be in everyone’s interest. It’s unbelievable how much anecdotal evidence is already out there with regard to psychedelics as a mental therapeutic. Myself and many others can swear by it and it’s only a little while away before the concept becomes mainstream and free of stigma. I’m in law school atm and willing to bet some of my savings on this company cause I have such a strong conviction. Whatever the outcome, at least I can say I’m invested my money towards fighting addiction, depression and ADHD. To the Moon 🚀💎

Note: the stock would spike 4-6x just on a single approved pipeline, they have a handful which all look promising."

MindMed and Compass are both in phase 2 of their trials and MindMed has way more things going for them than just shrooms. So why wouldn’t MindMed get to $50 in a couple months when Compass has?

2021-04-26 10:32:39,wallstreetbets,"I hate all of you clowns because your nonsense is gonna crash the market soon enough, but I am thrilled that you guys will be my bag-holder once you overheat the stock as I've been in it since 50 cents. Was planning to hold it longer as I firmly believe in the science here & the management team, but I'll gladly let you clowns help me cash out early. Holding 4,000 shares in my Roth so no tax liability when I sell the hype either!!"

2021-04-26 16:20:49,wallstreetbets,How do I buy this on E*TRADE?  I cannot figure it out
2021-04-26 14:46:15,wallstreetbets,So if we have some of the OTC (can't say the ticker) it will autoconvert in our brokerage to MNMD tomorrow?
2021-04-26 16:16:29,wallstreetbets,Congrats!!!

2021-04-26 00:19:39,wallstreetbets,I averaged down from $4.00 to $3.22. My Serotonin was on MAX last Friday.
2021-04-26 01:02:51,wallstreetbets,Mmed and trip are the most legitimate have them both.
2021-04-26 13:20:08,wallstreetbets,Ofc we like the stock
2021-04-25 23:37:57,wallstreetbets,No  one will know until market closes Monday
2021-04-25 20:17:00,wallstreetbets,I dropped my BB bags for this and havent looked back. Welcome to the revolution!

2021-04-26 10:33:40,wallstreetbets,Nasdaq volume will have big effect plus I believe little bit of media attention and YOLO calls will make it +20$ very soon
2021-04-26 11:42:15,wallstreetbets,It's still only just at it's previous high before this. It had a pull back before the listing news
2021-04-26 17:28:35,wallstreetbets,"Wondering same thing, maybe overnight it’ll switch over to nasdaq approved brokerages that’ll let you hit pre-market orders?"
2021-04-26 17:55:18,wallstreetbets,Mindmed has 357 mil shares outstanding and compass has 36 mil that’s why and Mindmed is already worth more then compass .. look at market cap
2021-04-26 17:35:30,wallstreetbets,Holy #$&*! MARKET CAP
2021-04-26 10:35:14,wallstreetbets,"You have no access to Frankfurt exchange ? If no, then wait for NASDAQ listing tomorrow, it's not too late btw, the party just about to begin with target +20$ within few weeks"
2021-04-26 10:40:10,wallstreetbets,Alot of people buying for long term
2021-04-26 12:21:04,wallstreetbets,So many idiots on here I swear. You're playing it smart by putting it in a ROTH IRA. I bet you some numb skulls aren't using a ROTH IRA or TFSA so they'll have to pay back their gains in taxes
2021-04-26 13:13:47,wallstreetbets,"Dude it’s just getting started. Listing tomorrow, then hang and I don’t mean just for tomorrow. It’s only fueling up now. Tomorrow is just ignition."
2021-04-26 16:19:42,wallstreetbets,Great question cause i couldn't find it anywhere on RH but finally found it on Fidelity.
2021-04-26 11:49:50,wallstreetbets,How do you invest in the company before its listed publicly??? Don't mean to sound like a idiot I'm just a noob and want to invest in good shit and I love psychedelics and am all for the benefits so I need to invest in this
2021-04-26 11:46:57,wallstreetbets,4.99 high today so far.
2021-04-26 17:41:36,wallstreetbets,Judgement day tomorrow 🍄 🚀
2021-04-25 22:59:37,wallstreetbets,im buying $10k worth tomorrow. lets run this up to $20 by tuesday!!
2021-04-26 19:58:06,wallstreetbets,Thank you! I’m newish to this. Makes sense now.
2021-04-25 23:21:14,wallstreetbets,thank you
2021-04-25 23:19:50,wallstreetbets,maybe it will finally pay back all the other ill-advised crap I bought
2021-04-26 03:20:01,wallstreetbets,Just bought some here as well!
2021-04-26 11:51:54,wallstreetbets,It’s listed on a different exchange. NEO exchange to be exact.
2021-04-26 11:49:32,wallstreetbets,Let’s close 5$ and it’s game on.
2021-04-26 09:39:53,wallstreetbets,Congrats. I put a buy order for 30k shares in @ .10 over the ask and it didn’t get filled. Seems like this is going to the moon.
2021-04-25 23:06:22,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-25 23:38:11,wallstreetbets,I have had some rough luck as well. I believe in this company though
2021-04-26 11:43:33,wallstreetbets,Ya think? Tried to get any painkillers lately. I couldn't even get any when my back surgery was postponed
2021-04-26 11:45:14,wallstreetbets,"Well it ain't heroin thats for sure, both are members of the opioid family, and thats where the similarities stop"
2021-04-25 22:11:17,wallstreetbets,"Me neither. Xans work too. But guess what, doesn’t matter, first to market matters. 🚀"
2021-04-25 22:02:58,wallstreetbets,So what's exactly does pre market and otc mean? When it changes roles on tuesday does it automatically transfer to that?
2021-04-25 22:12:04,wallstreetbets,Which I’ll make tendies off and hate myself the entire time
2021-04-25 22:22:55,wallstreetbets,Pre market is something different but if you meant the Nasdaq market then that makes sense. Yes any OTC shares will automatically switch to Nasdaq shares on Tuesday. The Nasdaq is available on every trading platform and will increase volume and visibility of the stock!
2021-04-26 11:49:14,wallstreetbets,"I have my pharm tech certificate and worked in a pharmacy for 2 years before realizing it would never pay me decently. Gained the knowledge though.  


And maybe best of all I even learned to spell heroin"
2021-04-26 08:59:20,wallstreetbets,Every cheater that goes down makes me smile.
2021-04-25 21:14:49,wallstreetbets,"BAML also froze the buy button and they self clear. 

Same with IBKR.

The actual reason is that the shorts were trapped, Thomas Petterfy said so on TV twice."
2021-04-26 11:21:37,wallstreetbets,YOU WERE SUPER WRONG. ADMIT IT
2021-04-26 02:07:38,wallstreetbets,"Considering standard for approval for covid vaccines is only 50% I think we’re good to go.  JNJ has a similar lower efficacy compared to mRNA vaccines.  And due to its single dose administration and less strict storage requirements saw it skyrocket in popularity.  I believe Covaxin will see a similar burst in popularity due to its storage/shelf life.  

One thing to note is that Covaxin is showing 70% efficacy against other strains of Covid.  95% efficacy on mRNA vaccines was founded during early-mid covid.

Plus you guys are saying this is too cheap?  Government is subsidizing covid vaccines across the nation, trust me they’ll pick the cheapest one they can find.  From my perspective in the pharmacy field, I’ve heard our reimbursement rates are upwards of $40 per administration.  I think the government would love to tightened up the margin a bit if they are paying less for the actual vaccine."
2021-04-26 12:04:41,wallstreetbets,"My thesis hasn't played out yet, I'm not right or wrong"

2021-04-25 21:00:11,wallstreetbets,"Another damn reason to own Paysafe. 

NY has plan in motion to legalize sportbetting. Texas and California soon will follow. Paysafe will wins no matter what platform people choose to bet. I love monopoly!

2021-04-25 20:07:03,wallstreetbets,"Got 200 contracts may 21st 2.50 NKLA 2 weeks ago
I’m praying it goes down"
2021-04-26 18:41:35,wallstreetbets,NKLA is a great stock to short. No one will shortsqueeze it like GME.
2021-04-26 11:35:14,wallstreetbets,"The lock up ends the 30th which means they can't sell till May 3rd correct?

I mean, that's what your comment implies, just making sure I'm not misinterpreting some of the comments here because some people bought puts that expire this week... whereas I'd expect the PR train to ramp things up until Monday if they can't sell things until then."
2021-04-26 14:13:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I think it’s smarter to just play it safe and short sell the stock. Stock prices often moon right after lockup as insiders hold their shares a little longer than expected, people take that as a bullish signal and buy in, then the insiders get to unwind their positions at the heightened price.

Of course, that also might not happen. But that’s why I’m going with shorts over puts. Either way, this stock is going down sooner or later—I’m just not gonna tie myself to an expiry date."
2021-04-26 11:46:22,wallstreetbets,"Insiders cannot sell until after April 30. Others, knowing this, will sell this week. The mass insider sell off will begin May 3."
2021-04-26 08:10:53,wallstreetbets,But will it run CRISIS?
2021-04-26 11:54:51,wallstreetbets,"Makes sense, looking forward to the chaos."
2021-04-26 08:09:18,wallstreetbets,That's not too soon? I'm thinking deadcat bounce here for a few weeks.
2021-04-26 03:46:04,wallstreetbets,I'm about to pass out from laughing-crying so hard.
2021-04-26 08:12:11,wallstreetbets,...is that you never cured Boneitis?
2021-04-26 18:55:40,wallstreetbets,Looks like neutralization of the variant b.1.617 is its main attribute and by that regard it may be better but still “only” 78% effective against all variants. I’m just saying this may not be the “most effective” in all regards...that said I bought 15 shares of OCGN today at open.
2021-04-25 21:08:34,wallstreetbets,if you check the other 3 vaccines submission->approval time it is just under 3 weeks from submission of the application. they are presumably filing that this week (that was their target in previous communications)
2021-04-25 22:31:56,wallstreetbets,"Interesting, this person works in the actually office that processes this exact type of authorization. I’m sure there is a rush on things that could possibly save many lives by the day. I’d imagine anything WuFlu related has been on a rushed timetable."

2021-04-26 19:45:27,wallstreetbets,"Usually I can detect sarcasm, but this ape shit has gotten absurd. I see people talking about asking others to remove their sell limits and how gme is going to hit 1 million dollars a share. I think they have be come so deluded I pretty much just assume everyone in here is just stating what they think."
2021-04-26 03:23:30,wallstreetbets,You selling or buying puts??
2021-04-25 23:34:54,wallstreetbets,I'm selling calls if you want them. I'm long af AMD but this week... I'm feeling shorty.
2021-04-26 00:16:43,wallstreetbets,AMD or NVDA? Serious question.
2021-04-26 01:24:43,wallstreetbets,I bought some Jan23 calls at 67.5. They break even at 90.
2021-04-26 02:46:46,wallstreetbets,Didn't they just say redditers? Oh that's right. When someone mentioned reddit they must be specifically talking about WSB. It couldn't possibly be the SKLZ sub that has been talking about a short squeeze for a couple weeks. Lol. Smh. Apes.
2021-04-26 10:11:13,wallstreetbets,Buy it up SKLZ let’s buy it now push we doing numbers this week!!
2021-04-25 21:33:48,wallstreetbets,"They don't develop their own games. They take a cut from the developers.

What happened to their prices immediately following the sales, though? 

Did it add those 100's of millions to their market cap overnight?"
2021-04-26 02:35:39,wallstreetbets,"Patent trading is big brain energy but that’s probably 50x Michael burray levels. I mean MB just had to look at total mortgage number and compare with income (who the fuck knows how he got those numbers). Patent trading is.... very difficult. I also kinda doubt blackberry has anything that others need this far out, unless it’s in their new direction which is self driving cars... but Tesla and google are ahead there.. patent trading is a dark, dark rabbit hole not worth going into. There’s easier ways to make money. You’d actually have to compare patents too and like ... know how the patents will be useful.

But hey in a new innovative industry it might be a great early indicator to see which companies (EVs for example) would be THE dog."

2021-04-25 22:08:29,wallstreetbets,Don't miss out 8 seconds more. I want every single one back.
2021-04-26 05:02:57,wallstreetbets,Yeah it sounded like a great idea untill I really thought about the business model they have. Would I get a mortgage from an app? Hell no. I was just looking for the gains without putting the work in. I've since learned that you really have to believe the company will succeed when you buy in or your just a sucker.
2021-04-26 04:58:31,wallstreetbets,Nope I'm using a service called skate. And it's very much like robinhood. Except can't trade options (being outside of the us and all). It's very difficult to find a quality US stock trader when your not actually in the US.

&#x200B;

>First off, as the pandemic hit and caused everyone to be forced to stay at home, the desire for residential fitness equipment skyrocketed. Even till today, residential and commercial customers are still having a hard time getting their hands on new dumbbells and strength equipment. Peloton monopolized hard on this pandemic not only by selling a shit ton of residential equipment such as spin bikes and treadmills, but by also requiring a pretty hefty subscription based service to use them. Something around $39 a month.

The reality no one has come up with a competitive fitness subscription service. There are many but can any of them command a $39 a month price tag, retain 90+% of their members, while also having such a high customer service rating. It's not even close. 

&#x200B;

>Second off, during late last year they made the financial decision to buy out a MAJOR fitness company that has been making commercial treadmills, ellipticals, upright and recumbent bikes, and several different strength equipment for 40 years. Peloton bought out Precor, along with all of their factories. Gyms will still be buying Precor simply for the name. Most gyms once they have a brand they like, keep buying that same brand for everything. Precor will still be a heavily demanded product.

This is one component that most people are underestimating. While Peloton got to ride the 2020 at home wave, they are in a position where they can ride the reopening wave as well. 

&#x200B;

>As for the recent accidents involving Peloton treadmills, all treadmills are dangerous and can kill you. This isn't something unique to Peloton. I don't care if they have roller guards on them or not, there is not one single treadmill out there that will protect you, a child, a pet, or any item from being sucked underneath the belt.  
>  
>If you want to prevent unnessary injury or death, remove your safety key from the treadmill when not in use if you live with children. Fitness equipment are not toys.

Exactly this. Any product can be misused. I read an article recently where someone tried to compare it to some item that meant for babies to sleep in. It was flipping over or something and killing them. The company refused to recall the product. It is truly mind boggling to me that they couldn't see a difference between this things. 

I know Peloton is saying they don't plan on doing anything about this but I'm willing to bet they are trying to come up with a solution. I think a software update could solve the issue to an extent. 

>Peloton will bounce back from this, and when they do, they will still be neck deep in both the residential and the commercial markets.

&#x200B;

Agreed. I think they will beat earnings and growth will be stronger than expected during earnings. Either people will catch on before earnings or after but by end of June I expect to see $150+ 

&#x200B;

I'd like to see some of the following be introduced in the next 12-18 months. 

* Commercial Peloton Equipment

I don't see this occurring in the near future but it's a no brainer with Precor buy. 

&#x200B;

* Strength Equipment (Residential)

This will happen this year I believe and I'd like to hear an update during this earnings report. 

&#x200B;

*  More of a focus on it's digital, $13/ month membership. 

Not everyone can afford the equipment and the reality is PTON makes it's money off of memberships. More time and effort should be put into people using the basic membership. There's talk of a Peloton fitness tracker coming out. I think this might not be the way to go. But I think they should consider sensors for 3rd party equipment  as well as a heart rate sensor so the people not buying the equipment can use their classes on their own. Right now while you can, there's no integration. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

By far the biggest mistake that can be made is comparing Peloton to other equipment manufactures. The idea that someone who bought a $2,000 bike will cancel their membership and stick their bike in the corner is ridiculous. Peloton wanted to start selling used bikes. They offered people who own the $1800 bike a $700 trade in credit towards their new more expensive bike, they have yet to start selling used bikes. My guess is because they aren't receiving enough bikes. They are in such high demand that they are selling near retail price used and they sell quickly. You'd have to be really lazy to give up nearly a $1,000 and not just sell it privately. 

 Their equipment is nothing without a membership, NO ONE will buy a Peloton and not get the membership with it. That next owner will buy a membership and Peloton keeps on pulling in money. The fact of the matter is a bike could exchange hands over and over again over the course of it's life and 90% of it's owners will be paying $40 a month for a membership. 

Comparing Peloton to another manufacturer is like comparing Tesla to Ford. Yeah, they make and sell cars but they do it in fundamentally different ways."
2021-04-26 07:37:24,wallstreetbets,It's broke $100 several times now recently and has bounced back.
2021-04-26 07:47:47,wallstreetbets,">90% of people quit their ""new"" exercise routines after 3 months.

Peloton has had an very high member retention rate long before COVID. This isn't relevant to PTON. 

If you spent $2,000 on a stationary bike: 

A. You are in the 10% group.

B. You are more likely to stick with it simply because of the expense you took on.

C. If you spent $2,000 on a stationary bike and the expense wasn't a big deal, you'll keep paying for the membership regardless of how often you use it.  

&#x200B;

>Once COVID restrictions let up, people are going to shy away from just working out at home

Agreed, but I don't think people will just toss their bike in the corner and cancel their membership. Again, if you spent the money on the bike and the membership you can probably afford a $20-$50 gym membership on top of it. Spin classes are not the same as a gym membership. People will want to continue their spin classes while also utilizing equipment a traditional gym has, such as strength equipment."
2021-04-26 07:56:40,wallstreetbets,"Exactly this. There's many things, that if used as it wasn't intended and disregarding the safety guidelines can hurt and kill you. If people were getting hurt while using the equipment correctly and following guidelines, and be all for them doing something about it."
2021-04-26 07:53:16,wallstreetbets,Lol do you know what commercial gym equipment costs?? A ton. Besides the fact that gyms buying in bulk would probably get a hefty discount.
2021-04-26 14:03:57,wallstreetbets,"So you think people are going to keep paying $39/month for something they don't use?  Interesting.

I don't think people are going to ""throw them away"", but there's two possibilities:

- People just stop using them and cancel the $39/mo.  Becomes a coat rack in their basement.  Subscriptions drop.

- People dump them on the used market.  This will reduce new purchases by quite a bit.  Subscriptions remain flat as those buying the bikes would now become a member.  

I think that overall, new customers is going to drop quite a bit.  Once people aren't trapped in their houses, many will be back at the gym, etc."
2021-04-26 07:50:24,wallstreetbets,"Exactly this. People want to believe the world will go back to exactly how it was and the reality is some things have changed forever. Gyms, movie theaters, the workplace will be permanently changed. Gyms will not see as many people as they did pre-covid, at least not in the long term."
2021-04-26 16:34:56,wallstreetbets,"I don't think anyone is going to consciously think I'm not going to use my $2k bike anymore, let me cancel membership and use my bike as a clothes rack. I think use will go down subconsciously but people will retain their membership. I mean this is the gym model, sell way more memberships than the building can handle and hope they don't use it.  

Yeah people might drop them on the market but Peloton makes their money through their subscriptions. I don't have a bike, the $1800 price tag plus a $40 membership is too steep for me but if I can get one on Craigslist for less than $1000 I'll jump on it. Or if I realize 50+% gain on my shares lmao

A used bike selling for less means they are able to reach more people."
2021-04-26 19:26:30,wallstreetbets,"Yes, Peloton makes money on subscriptions, but if people sell their bikes to other people, then it is a net wash in subscription growth.  (e.g. -1 for sale / +1 for purchaser  vs. Original Owner (+1) / New Purchase instead of Used Purchase (+1) )

I understand the membership model; however, I suspect people are going to go BACK to gyms and it is unlikely they will maintain both a gym membership *AND* a peloton.

2021-04-26 05:18:26,wallstreetbets,"Russia won’t invade Ukraine, they’ll get the entirety of NATO on their ass, they got the people, but their equipment is shit.
Would not be in Russia’s best interest to do so."
2021-04-26 14:37:20,wallstreetbets,"Yes, then you agree ceding from Ukraine was the only choice on the ballot. Hence it was an illegitimate vote. I guess even the Tatars voted to join Russia since all of the polling places were surrounded by vacationing Russian soldiers with machine guns. Just Russia's weak attempt to legitimize their aggression. If it was a legitimate reaction to NATO interference, why did Putin have to lie bout the involvement of the Russian military and print up ballots that would have allowed the citizens to vote to stay in Ukraine as one of their choices. His actions kill your argument. We will never know what the majority of the populace wanted."
2021-04-26 13:06:02,wallstreetbets,Need some new RKT posts on WSB......LFG!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-04-26 15:21:01,wallstreetbets,I got the bubble teas.
2021-04-26 15:23:30,wallstreetbets,"No way man, bulk are shares actually, I've lost too much on options on this stock already. It's being pinned down because degenerates bought too many options. Provides a great entry for shares though."
2021-04-26 15:29:13,wallstreetbets,Wait till after earnings and we can post our Gainzzz Porn
2021-04-26 15:12:51,wallstreetbets,"hahaha, thanks. I'm trying to make DFV proud."
2021-04-26 15:25:59,wallstreetbets,No fun either!
2021-04-26 15:20:11,wallstreetbets,"We ride together, we die together, Rkteers4lyfe...(though watching MVIS does make my eye twitch)"
2021-04-26 15:36:33,wallstreetbets,"Really? You cray cray... jk. There's plenty of DD you can search, as for my personal reasons you YOLOing, I detail them here. Contains links to youtube so couldn't post it as DD.

2021-04-26 15:14:45,wallstreetbets,"I really didn't want to insult you BTW. All good fun.

Also I'm looking forward for your updates. Good luck again!"
2021-04-26 15:17:29,wallstreetbets,"Haha, I know man. It's all good. Thanks, you too."
2021-04-26 09:42:15,wallstreetbets,And now? xD omg
2021-04-26 14:50:12,wallstreetbets,You don't even wanna know it's dirty
2021-04-26 14:52:06,wallstreetbets,Anyways I love your absolutely perfect timing on this play haha HOLA
2021-04-26 00:08:41,wallstreetbets,"Here is my DD on gopro. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O\_7eLO-FhWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_7eLO-FhWs)

Not financial advice, not an investment professional/financial professional/financial advisor. 

I'm just here to say fuck gopro."
2021-04-25 23:29:06,wallstreetbets,I thought WSB was against shorting?  Happy to squeeze your money into my pockets with this crappy bear thesis.
2021-04-26 03:14:50,wallstreetbets,No bamboozles it’d be easy for GoPro to improve their company to 25/share in today’s environment.
2021-04-25 20:00:24,wallstreetbets,well thats part of the subscription.. 30-50% off their accessories..
2021-04-25 22:44:56,wallstreetbets,Fighting hedge funds? Dude wsb is about making money if you have other goals go join an activism group...
2021-04-25 23:32:02,wallstreetbets,"The gopro sub organically grew to 500k subs from 2017-2019 prior to them focusing on improving the subscription perks.  What did they learn?  People re-subscribe.  They will resub for the camera insurance alone let alone all the other perks.  I'm actually happy to see a WSB thread shorting this, because honestly I don't think many people here have big brains"
2021-04-26 15:17:00,wallstreetbets,In for 1500 shares!
2021-04-26 14:55:10,wallstreetbets,"Bruh, this is 80k now"
2021-04-26 09:07:21,wallstreetbets,It's at $20.40 now.
2021-04-26 16:39:15,wallstreetbets,HAHAHAA
2021-04-26 09:59:53,wallstreetbets,"\+22% today, this one has been wild so many +20% days"
2021-04-25 22:53:40,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations, that’s an awesome accomplishment! I’m coming up on 18 years and I still talk like I’m coked out of my mind sometimes ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grimacing)"
2021-04-26 00:10:12,wallstreetbets,you've just unlocked parts of your brain thats all.. cant undo
2021-04-26 15:46:25,wallstreetbets,congrats on your strong hands for MVIS!
2021-04-26 00:25:29,wallstreetbets,Just bought 100
2021-04-26 15:06:11,wallstreetbets,It’s a shame this guy deleted his comment lol
2021-04-26 11:21:35,wallstreetbets,Not a millionaire but I’m comfortably out of debt now. I did take some profits for that reason on our last run to $24 but kept right at 4500 shares. Have added since then and still except awesome profits
2021-04-26 13:07:44,wallstreetbets,Yes sir!
2021-04-26 17:46:15,wallstreetbets,Please tell me you held the calls.
2021-04-26 14:50:00,wallstreetbets,You’re still having a good day I hope. Really wishing I’d jumped in on some of those haha
2021-04-26 18:06:28,wallstreetbets,"fucking DUH. these things aren't even close to done. personally, I think they are gonna kick ass on the 29th (why move up the date unless you had really good news) and this shit will hit $40+.

that said, it might be great news and then the stock goes down $2 lol. you know how it do.

cost basis: $98.68
current value: $740

i had already invested everything else i had into other stuff or I would have YOLO'd this because I knew it was a good play, but my philosophy is to stick to your guns once you make a trade, so I didn't suck money out of other stuff to fund this one."
2021-04-26 18:12:53,wallstreetbets,"I hope you're right. I bought with all my remaining cash when Jim Cramer said to avoid this one.

Cost basis: $443.60 Current value: $1,170

Also didn't YOLO because I'm committed to other investments."
2021-04-26 18:20:10,wallstreetbets,"Rofl same. I was already bullish on it but when Cramer shit on it I immediately opened a position lol.

It's not gonna save/break me one way or the other. ""sell before earnings"" yeah okay, but I bought this specifically to sell it AFTER the earnings because I think it will go up.

Good luck to us both!"
2021-04-26 18:24:27,wallstreetbets,"also, I think after the buyout it could go to like fuckin' $80 or something much higher than $45. that could well happen before August 20, and if it does? these things will be fuckin' moon tickets my man"
2021-04-26 00:20:25,wallstreetbets,"Here's a theory for why BB wants to settle with FB on the patents: if AMZN wanted to acquire BB, they don't want to be locking horns with another tech giant.

Long BB 62,350 shares @ $8 since 2013"
2021-04-26 12:48:58,wallstreetbets,I got my fills but per usual I top-ticked it. We'll see about earnings!
2021-04-26 02:47:57,wallstreetbets,How so?
2021-04-26 03:19:20,wallstreetbets,They are setup to profit $2000 per vehicle on the base model and more on upper trims.
2021-04-26 00:09:19,wallstreetbets,"I think I may FOMO into TLRY tomorrow in size

Even if it doesn't moon this year, it eventually will because people like to fuck with this stock every couple years"
2021-04-26 00:10:50,wallstreetbets,FOMO'd into TSLA this past week. This thing is going to moon after Elon's SNL appearance.
2021-04-25 20:56:39,wallstreetbets,"Right there with you brother, to the effin moon"
2021-04-26 07:33:01,wallstreetbets,AMD long!
2021-04-26 14:42:19,wallstreetbets,This didn't age well...
2021-04-26 07:18:20,wallstreetbets,"Lol. This aged well. If it were so easy to predict how juries will decide a case, there wouldn’t be an entire industry based upon jury selection techniques by trial lawyers."
2021-04-26 07:27:43,wallstreetbets,"True. I still like the spirit of this play though. VERY minimal downside, reasonable potential upside. Safer than straight gambling, though I like straight gambling too. Definitely safer than playing straight earnings"
2021-04-26 12:11:48,wallstreetbets,Care to give us an update after 5/5?
2021-04-26 13:12:59,wallstreetbets,"I think I'll update after calls expire and I pick up 4,500 more shares. Up about $5k right now on the position so this week has been positive!"
2021-04-26 16:11:53,wallstreetbets,Sweet
2021-04-26 16:44:05,wallstreetbets,"OP, how is it looking now?"
2021-04-26 16:19:24,wallstreetbets,Getting nervous??
2021-04-26 19:12:03,wallstreetbets,"Ouch , tell me where did it hurt ?"
2021-04-26 02:15:39,wallstreetbets,So how has this year been at your company? better than last?
2021-04-26 18:03:53,wallstreetbets,this is very old news
2021-04-26 07:50:02,wallstreetbets,Please do it. I can't wait any longer to get a house
2021-04-26 09:33:31,wallstreetbets,"for bet sake, 5"

2021-04-26 16:25:56,wallstreetbets,I love you bastards!
2021-04-26 12:14:50,wallstreetbets,Like bigger things are still coming
2021-04-26 15:20:29,wallstreetbets,How much do you think it will go up to?
2021-04-26 17:37:28,wallstreetbets,"I had all ready to buy my next round of MVIS options at 930 bell for around 3.50 a share.... but i dozed off and woke up at 1030 and they were 6.50 a share for same thing.. wow i hate myself today. Still got some though... so i got some real cheap, and some pretty expensive... if anyone asks ill just say i bought them all at my $12 avg... lol"
2021-04-25 22:58:23,wallstreetbets,My only worry is one day this son of a bitch uses the Inverse Cramer strategy to his advantage.
2021-04-26 15:51:19,wallstreetbets,I have mvis. YOLO
2021-04-26 16:16:42,wallstreetbets,"Ok, fine, I'm in."
2021-04-25 21:06:05,wallstreetbets,Considering most of their new products are shit compared to what else is available im not surprised. only reason they still have any power is because they own the OS and have gov tie-ins.
