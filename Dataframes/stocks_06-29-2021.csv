6/29/2021 19:42,stocks,"Oh yes... All day. I have bought 3 cars from them, all excellent deals and amazingly easy to buy... Honestly the easiest car buying ever.... With the used car market jammed up with massive demand and OEM dealers having chip shortage issues, I'd believe it."
6/29/2021 19:40,stocks,"FED doesn’t want to do this since 

a) It would scare the entire market. If they suddenly announced that they were going to raise rates in the short term, people would go nuts.

b) They still heavily feel that inflation will be transitory. They have repeated this over and over again. FED thinks that hikes in commodity prices can solve themselves as time goes by.

and c) FED is trying to get as much people to work as possible. That is their main priority right now and will be until they think enough people have gone to work."
6/29/2021 19:49,stocks,So what makes you think raising interest rates would ease commodity prices at all? Quite frankly all it would do at this point is make small business (the ones reliant on loans) absolutely crumble and tank the stock market in it's entirety. Lumber prices? There's still not enough lumber around to meet demand so that wouldn't fix it at all.
6/29/2021 19:58,stocks,"Yeah the FED is waiting for full employment at the same time our government had been handing out more dollars for people to stay at home.   The FED has gotten themselves in a pickle.  And the child payments kick-in in July.  Labor and raw materials are costing companies more money, prices will continue to rise as companies digest these higher costs.   And the only place to make a decent return is the stock market which is becoming one of the highest valued market in stock market history (currently just behind the dot.com bubble]."
6/29/2021 19:36,stocks,Banks aren't making much money off of money
6/29/2021 19:38,stocks,"Labor shortage, not product scarcity. Thats why they say inflation is temporary. Theres access to supply and demand is high, but apparently executives cant run businesses by themselves..."
6/29/2021 19:44,stocks,"It’s about credibility. The Fed said they’d let transitory inflation run, and if they backtrack on that after just a couple quarters of inflation the market will take a massive shit"
6/29/2021 19:39,stocks,There are some people buying houses today that are absolutely maxing themselves out. The base rate they are paying is partly based on the FED rate. If the rate goes from .25 -> .5 the effect could wipe them out. I personally think if you put yourself in that situation you're stupid..
6/29/2021 19:52,stocks,"The Fed had a difficult balancing act.
If interest rates go up the US will have even bigger deficits."
6/29/2021 19:46,stocks,I know
6/29/2021 19:58,stocks,Do you think it’s really transitory? I feel like they wish it would be but know better
6/29/2021 19:56,stocks,Tbf some people can’t wait an eternity for housing prices to come back to reality.
6/29/2021 19:15,stocks,"The Q&A was enlightening, as well. I was going to take profits but I might add as others sell."
6/29/2021 19:48,stocks,2000 shares at $4. One of my personal favorites
6/29/2021 19:15,stocks,"There are some shitty analysts following this stock if they missed their estimates by 5x

Negative revenue for an ammo company in a time where gun stores can’t keep it on the shelf seems like a pretty big red flag. Why are they having so much trouble?"
6/29/2021 19:16,stocks,In for 1000 @ 9.55
6/29/2021 19:33,stocks,I'm not selling this is long term growth for at least a couple of years. maybe they will do a Dividend later down the road.
6/29/2021 19:35,stocks,They wanted the price down so they could get in cheap!
6/29/2021 19:34,stocks,"Did you get in today, or was this from before? i would like to see $25 by EOY"
6/29/2021 18:38,stocks,There will be an increase in the amount of shares which Tilray will use to raise capital. This could cause share prices to drop as they are now more diluted. The positive to this is the company now has more capital to make acquisitions that will bolster Tilray going forward.
6/29/2021 18:44,stocks,Vote yes and buy puts.  /s
6/29/2021 19:04,stocks,Welcome to biotech stocks. This is what happens on trial news usually. Either they beat expectations and report really positive results and the stock spikes or they report mixed results (which happened with this one) and it's below expectations and the stock sinks. If you are starting I could recommend just steering clear of most bio stocks they can be too much of a gamble imo.
6/29/2021 19:50,stocks,"Thanks for the insight! Now I gotta look into my other stocks, didn't realize bio could be such a gamble. I might hold on a little bit otherwise I might bail with the rest.

Appreciate the response."
6/29/2021 19:45,stocks,"I’d hold both honestly. As others have said, AMD is taking more and more market share with their cpus, both consumer and data center. 

Nvidia has a HUGE AI benefit with their GPUs and I see that being a giant plus for their future as we move toward a more autonomous workforce. 
I’d probably go 60/40 NVDA/AMD"
6/29/2021 18:28,stocks,I own both and use both. I see better growth for AMD tech.
6/29/2021 18:16,stocks,Just here to comment that I own both in equal percentage in my portfolio! I love them both!
6/29/2021 19:08,stocks,"Learn as much as you can about both. This could be a very good example of Buffett’s “great company at a fair price is better than a fair company at a great price.”

However, I also think that the XLNX acquisition is going to improve AMD significantly, and based on revenue projections and price multiples, the share price stands to have a solid, market-beating upward push over the 2022-2024 time frame. (This is the same math I used to predict its 2021 would leave something to be desired.)"
6/29/2021 19:09,stocks,AMD
6/29/2021 18:28,stocks,"AMD no question, much lower multiples concerning P/E and price to free cash flow with more growth potential in my opinion, is destroying intel in gaining market share of CPU's and in data centers. NVDA is trading at a ridiculous multiple and has run up of the news of a split which doesn't change anything. I LOVE both COMPANIES but hate NVDA's stock. I could be missing something tho."
6/29/2021 18:57,stocks,"NVDA is valued the way it is because of GPU sales. It prints moneys.

I'm not sure if AMD has the same kind of pricing power. It just didn't have a mining specific advantage (that's what we're talking about here).

The ability to price their cards higher to get more fab space. Nvidia is still higher performing."
6/29/2021 19:25,stocks,Just buy both
6/29/2021 18:39,stocks,Nvda
6/29/2021 18:43,stocks,AMD ALL MY DICK BABY!
6/29/2021 19:16,stocks,"I think they're both great investments if you'd bought them earlier, but, personally, I'm not getting into either right now. They've both recently had big run-ups in a small amount of time, and I think it would be buying at the top right now, which means I think there's a good chance both might start going down soon (although there might be a spike up during NVDA's stock split). In that sense, I think they might both could be risky investments right now. Then again, I might be wrong, too."
6/29/2021 18:22,stocks,Plan on purchasing NVDA after split. Interested in opinions.
6/29/2021 18:57,stocks,"Go against the grain, buy INTC.

Undervalued, better fundamentals, and traded at an attractive price than these two."
6/29/2021 19:43,stocks,"aka just buy it, time in market>timing the market"
6/29/2021 19:00,stocks,"Like others have said, watch for a pullback post-split, will likely be some profit taking. Then average in."
6/29/2021 18:55,stocks,"TSLA took a long time to recover after the selloff after its split.

Be careful on the timing."
6/29/2021 18:53,stocks,whats the difference
6/29/2021 19:18,stocks,"My guy even as someone who looks for undervalued companies there is a large reason for why INTC is trading at such low multiples, AMD. Just today INTC delayed another one of their data center chips. Even as someone who used to own INTC and now has AMD you have to realize that you have to pay a premium for growth, in this current market a lot of stocks are way above their deserved premium but AMD is not one of them, they have very strong growth prospects regarding chips and I see it as the best chip play followed up by AVGO, SWKS, and QCOM."
6/29/2021 19:56,stocks,"Intel can’t even break the 12nm fab barrier while AMD is already at 7nm. Intel has already lost 20% of the data center chip sales to AMD, and it’s going to get worse. Intel won’t get their own fab plants up and running for years, and TSMC will be treating them as second class citizens in the mean time. The list goes on and on."
6/29/2021 19:18,stocks,Their stock split might be treated as a pump and dump
6/29/2021 19:41,stocks,dawg this isnt gme or amc
6/29/2021 19:06,stocks,You can build the quintessential reddit portfolio with the majority of the recommendations here. Someone needs to create a reddit etf.
6/29/2021 18:51,stocks,"Fintech is a big space for me, e-commerce will keep growing and payments will keep becoming more digitized, so I'm all about SQ and PYPL"
6/29/2021 19:49,stocks,"The entire genomics sector—CRSP, NTLA, BEAM, etc.

The possibilities are world-changing in a dozen different ways, and the technology is only going to get more sophisticated. What’s happening currently—CRSP has very possibly cured sickle-cell anemia—is incredibly promising, but it feels like the gene-editing equivalent the first game developers releasing Pong. I believe big things are coming from this sector over the next few decades, and I want to get in on the action early."

6/29/2021 17:56,stocks,"UMG. I’m in PSTH already and I’m not advocating anyone invest in it without doing the research first, but the music industry is coming back with a vengeance, streaming is up, live music will be making comebacks, NFTs are starting to get mentioned with Universal, I think it’s going to be an earner YOY for me for at least the next 5 years. Holding for that long is the initial plan for me and will reevaluate after.

Really high quality business, a sister play would be WMG as well. I’m fairly certain it will trade on the NYSE, but if your interested in the music industry there is a lot of time to research. Do your own DD and when it does list, it’s going to be a solid long-term play."
6/29/2021 17:45,stocks,"NVDA when it splits and PLTR, yes it was a meme stock but its 33% of my portfolio and has good financials and targets are always exceeded. Continue to increase your AMD and AAPL and I think you’ll be happy in 10 years!"
6/29/2021 18:35,stocks,"BABA. The biggest retailer in the biggest country in the world, and it's expanding."
6/29/2021 18:46,stocks,TTD
6/29/2021 18:16,stocks,"I will try to give picks that aren't the same as the previously mentioned ones

Cloudflare - imo the best CDN and has a large customer base. Cyber security will just be get even more important as time goes on.

Funko - huge play into nerd culture that is just growing and growing. They are expanding into the children sector and to me kids and nerds spend the most amount of money. NFT is nice but i am not banking on that for Funko to grow

STEM - A SPAC but imo it's the best play into renewable energy sector. The way I see it the only way for our electric generation to be 100% renewable is through virtual power plants (in short you save electricity when it's easily generated (ie windy days or sunny days) and use the saved electricity when it's harder to generate. Some areas may generate more electricity than others so you sell from high generation areas to low generation areas) Mix and match renewable sources for maximum success. The weather related failure of the power grid is just showing the problems with a centralised power grid that STEM can solve as well. 

Kroger, Unilever, Proctor Gamble, Kimberly Clark - recession proof, for UL PG and KMB the range of products and brand power will almost ensure that they will thrive in the future. Kroger imo the best grocery stock.

Huya/Douyu - streaming is the future, Huya and Douyu individually are bigger than Twitch and they have a better monetization structure. Being Chinese (although not from China) I know how much mainlanders love their eSports and Huya has that sector on lockdown. Imo the death of traditional sport channels in china will be at the hands of Huya but even if they don't, the gaming industry is big in China and is getting bigger. If Douyu and Huya merges, it's practically a monopoly. It's already profitable and the YoY growth is amazing.

Edit: I think all mentioned will be big in 10 years time but I think some of them are extremely overvalued. Funko, Cloudflare are crazily overvalued rn, UL had a huge jump in price recently so maybe just keep them on your watchlist Huya is crazily undervalued tho"
6/29/2021 17:57,stocks,"Highest conviction: PLTR, CCIV, and my own mini etfs for space and fintech.

Highest confidence: visa, MSFT, apple, amzn"
6/29/2021 17:44,stocks,"PLTR. 

They have mastered the government business and are expanding into the private sector. Thiel is a genius and I have full faith in him and Karp. 

Data analytics is a huge problem to solve and they are showing they are the best at it. 

Just my guess."
6/29/2021 19:38,stocks,"CRSR all the way. At the moment it seems that only actual gamers really appreciate what the company is doing and capable of. CRSR having the ecosystem of products it does, the ability to expand and up-sell is one of the most promising attributes of this company."
6/29/2021 17:57,stocks,"NVDA and AMZN

I also love COIN, SQ and DE long term (saying nothing about current valuations)"

6/29/2021 17:51,stocks,Workday. Their product is a recession proof SaaS that is head and shoulders above the competition. Oracle and SAP are considered downgrades by industry insiders. It’s not hard to envision a world where most or all companies are Workday customers.
6/29/2021 18:42,stocks,"ORGN - super speculative as no earnings yet but great order sheet and potential trillion $ market

NET - cybercrime will continue to grow fast and it causes trillions in damages. Their services also a key piece in the data privacy puzzle.

6/29/2021 19:58,stocks,"I never see it mentioned here but AXON. They invented the tazer and sell body cameras to police departments. They also now sell recurring revenue cloud products for storing data about these products’ usage (body cam footage, tazer usage, etc). Plus with a market cap of only $11B I believe, there’s plenty of room for them to explode in the coming decade."
6/29/2021 18:20,stocks,"AMD and DIS. It’s my entire portfolio outside of my 401k. 
I might short BA, but I’m not going long on them.

Additionally, many of the products they sell are non-essential which I don't like considering we're coming out of a pandemic and people only buy the products as a gift. Lastly, and this was the breaking point for me, their recent acquisition of Depop.

We don’t watch the NFL anymore, don’t spend money on Nike, Starbucks, target etc, don’t have Netflix because of the child p o r n. As bad as Disney is in this regards, I’ve got a 2 year old son, so we’ll have Disney+ for at least the next decade as longer as it keeps the older stuff. 

Agree with my politics or not, this is how half the country feels and a significant portion of the world. 

TL/DR Disney+ is essential for ALL parents period.

P/E is Price to Earnings. Usually the lower the P/E ratio the better the stock since the stock price isn't so high compared to the company's earnings. When I was in college, anything with a P/E ratio ocer 20 was a loser stock. But the internet revolution changed that where the P/E didn't matter because of expected growth. 

PEG is P/E divided by expected growth. Anything over 1 is considered overvalued.  So its your P/E ratio divided by expected earnings growth."

6/29/2021 17:50,stocks,"There are many ways to calculate PE ratios. Most of the time, they are likely using different Earnings amounts. Some people like to use TTM earnings, some people like to use earnings from fiscal year end, some use average earnings over a certain amount of years, forward earnings, etc. 

Price also sometimes vary, I see some people use average price over a year, current price, day closing price, fiscal year end priced, etc. 

There is no one correct way of calculating a PE ratio because at the end of the day, all methods they use, use a variation of “price” and “earnings”. This is why you should calculate your own PE ratios."
6/29/2021 18:01,stocks,Different sources classify some companies into different industries.
6/29/2021 17:52,stocks,"Damn. So, what’s the point of calculating it if it’s just going to be subjective/speculative to a degree of ones own liking ? How is that a reliable measure of valuing a company or, comparing two ? I am confused."
6/29/2021 18:51,stocks,"Different websites don’t take into account that you’ll use other websites to compare companies. One website one prefer one way to calculate PE over the other because they believe it’s a more reliable measure. 

For instance, TTM PE vs Forward PE. One website might prefer TTM PE more than the other because they might believe it’s a more accurate measure of what the “true” earnings are for a company because it’s already earned (past tense - achieved). While another website might prefer a Forward PE because they believe companies are valued for their future earnings hence, using projected earnings is a more accurate depiction of whether or not a company is undervalued. If a company has a historically inconsistent earnings, you might choose an average PE over a TTM for example. 

Is one right or wrong? Not really, they both have their own arguments supporting their own calculation of PE. This just really goes to show that not one metric can be reliably used as a base measure for all industries/ companies.   

Investing isn’t really about getting it numerically correct. You want to be “just about” correct than absolutely wrong. If investing and figuring out a company is over or undervalued is a complete numerical game, computers would already be invented for it and there would be no jobs in the industry besides the mechanical/ maintenance staff. 

You don’t necessarily have to calculate it yourself, you can use a website if you really want, but like I previously mentioned. Websites typically just use 1 way of calculating PE since it’s typically run by software programs. That one way might not necessarily be the “best” way of valuing a company. Again, Forward PEs might be better in growth companies and TTM PEs might be better for more stable companies.

Edit:
Besides my long winded explanation above, the other comment actually answers your main question about industry averages more accurately as well. Websites classify some companies in different industries. For example Apple might be really hard to classify."

However, granted that it would be easy to flip money back into the stock and potentially hit gains, 1.5 would be bare minimum. And that would be with getting a house, which removes rent and leaves property taxes, so annual cost drops.

The “maybe”’in that first paragraph is related to living off a fixed income while everything around you is getting more expensive. I’ve no idea how old you are, but let’s say you could successfully pull in $100k / year for the rest of your life. As inflation happens - rent goes up, property tax goes up, food, gas, cars get more expensive, your income stays the same.

6/29/2021 18:27,stocks,Why do people say this isn’t possible? I’ve made upwards of 20% return every month on my swing trades for two years…. If you buy 5 stocks a month and each gain 4%-5% each thats an easy 20% return…. Correct me if I’m wrong or if I’ve just gotten lucky…
6/29/2021 17:24,stocks,"This doesn’t seem to account for taxes.  You would need 100k (assuming 20% tax rate).  If your investments earn 4%, you need 2.5 million to have 80k spendable cash.  Also, make sure to account for health care when calculating ur expenses."

You've also been spending $ to live during that time, so now you're down to $400k if your expenses are 50k/year. So now next year you make 10% (avg return) and you're at 440, but you spent 50 to live. 390 now.

The problem with having the minimum is needing a large stable emergency fund, or you're screwed in the dry/bearish period having to spend off your nut"
6/29/2021 18:26,stocks,A monkey could’ve gotten a 20% return in 2020.
6/29/2021 18:08,stocks,"You take risky investments (fully expecting to lose them) TO build up a big number, let's say one million, then you take that one million and get 5% a year but much lower risk. That's a big reason *why* you want to retire with a huge amount of cash. 

When you invest risky you make up the losses with your paycheck. If there was no risk you could just retire with a tiny amount and live off that 20% a year."

Ill do this 4-5 times a month resulting in a 20% return.

6/29/2021 19:58,stocks,I’ve made 40% return this month just swinging meme stocks. Maybe instead of everyone hating why not ask my game plan and hope to have the same results?
6/29/2021 17:07,stocks,"Sorry to disappoint but a 38% return last year wasn't necessarily very good.

In the last 12 months the NASDAQ is up 40%
In the last 12 months the S&P is up 38%

Your returns day trading are on par or slightly below what they would have been had you just stuck your money in an index fund and didn't touch it.

Here's the thing, the S&P 500 since 1926 has averaged about a 10% return. That's nearly a hundred years worth of stock market data telling you that while not uncommon to see a gain over 20% in one year, it's very unlikely for that gain to be sustained year over year.

If you are looking to retire early most people follow the 3.5% rule. Which states that if your investments are well diversified it is considered safe for you to withdraw 3.5% of your portfolio to live off of every year. This withdrawal leaves room for inflation and market volatility.

So the math is simple unless you can consistently and I mean in both good markets and bad markets beat the S&P 500, then you better not retire until you would be comfortable living off of 3.5% of your investments."

I'm averaging a 32% annual return which is about double the S&P for the same time frame. But I know the odds of me sustaining that are against me. And that I really benefited by investing heavily in tech which of course is on a historic bull run.

The dream is to trade full-time along with some other side hustles so I can quit my day job. But I don't think I can do that until I have plenty of runway and a couple more years of sustained success."
6/29/2021 18:40,stocks,"The last 15 months have been an insane bull market, plenty of stocks have done 100+% in that time, making money when the market is sideways or down for long periods of time will be much harder"

6/29/2021 18:49,stocks,"The last bear market we seen was during the pandemic in 2020 and the last one before that was 2009. I understand the concern for losing a majority of your portfolio in a bear market, but if you play your cards right and look at it like a buying opportunity I don’t see it as being negative. Yes I won’t see my normal returns monthly, but once the bear market ends my investments I bought on the dip will pay off. I’m just super confused as to why people think this is so impossible."
6/29/2021 17:38,stocks,"Don't worry about the down votes. People are doing it because one year worth of returns mean very little in the grand scheme of things.

If you enjoy day trading keep doing it and continue trying to get better. But remember your success should not be measured based on your return but rather based on your return versus the indexes. If you can't outperform the indexes over the exact same date range then your trade was actually a losing one."
6/29/2021 18:57,stocks,"The issue is thinking it'll play like that for the rest of your life, especially as you age and spend less time trading. The original comment was about retirement, and expecting to be able to double the returns of the market as a passive investor is unreasonable."

Yes my luck may run out  sooner than later, but if I can make 1% off of a $100,000 investment that’s a quick $1000 if I can do that 5 times a month at 5% return thats an easy $5000 a month. I don’t think it would be entirely impossible to retire with this strategy but then again I spend 10 hours a day researching my next move."
6/29/2021 19:25,stocks,"Right, you are playing the risk, and eventually your luck will run out. Unless you really know what you are doing, you are essentially at the slot machine right now on a hot streak.. but the house always wins."
6/29/2021 16:35,stocks,"Buying a company for cheap you get a one-off benefit of going from the cheap price to its fair value. And then you own a shit company. Returns will end there. 

Buying a great company, you get no one-off benefit from it being undervalued / cheap. But you own a great company that is presumably well run and therefore grows strongly and is profitable. So in the medium-longs run you do better."
6/29/2021 17:56,stocks,"Simply put, because the wonderful company is going to keep growing and producing gains. The average company isn't. Time > timing and all that."
6/29/2021 18:27,stocks,“A great business at a fair price is superior to a fair business at a great price” - Charlie Munger (Buffet’s long time business partner who often doesn’t get the credit he deserves).
6/29/2021 17:02,stocks,"For simplicity, assume that the stock has $1 in earnings and sells for $10, with a P/E of 10.  You buy 1,000 shares for $10,000.  Hold the stock for 50 years, with the earnings compounding at 12% per year.  The $1 in earnings becomes $289.  When you sell, the P/E has dropped to 5.  You make 10000\*(289/1)\*(5/10), which is still slightly above 10%.  

&#x200B;

So... the longer you hold the stock and the longer the earnings are allowed to compound, the less the ""exchange rate"" (i.e., the differences in P/E on the buy and sell dates) will affect your annual compounding rate of return.  The better the company, the more confident you can be about how quickly earnings will compound.

&#x200B;

Of course, it's even better to buy when the P/E is low and sell when the P/E is high."
6/29/2021 18:43,stocks,Buffett is a really old dude and the main narrative he throws out is that he has seen plenty of companies come and go.  So I would assume he is thinking long term investments.  Wonderful companies last while average companies die out.
6/29/2021 19:26,stocks,"Because more cash goes to wonderful companies.If it’s a company that no one heard of, then there’s less chance for price improvement as no one is buying it except you. Think AAPL,TSLA,GME, huge speculation, price is soaring"
6/29/2021 16:50,stocks,"This. Think Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, etc. They were very rarely - if ever - cheap, but they have been outstanding investments."
6/29/2021 17:11,stocks,"What I’m really looking for here is the math. If the cheapest 1% returns 20% per year, how much do the “best” 1% return?  And how is that even measured?"
6/29/2021 18:54,stocks,Agree. The original Warren Buffett buys dog-crap undervalued stocks. Charlie Munger taught him about picking stocks with competitive moats. That's what made Warren Buffett today.
6/29/2021 18:39,stocks,"There is none. The entire thing is theoretical and whether something is great or average depends on what you base the view on. Referring directly to your question here, not the entire topic.

The main enemy in the market is risk. That's why risk management is such a big thing and why most people recommend just investing into large indexes like country or world ETF. Most people can't deal with risk well and even those that can can't always predict it. And losses hurt hard. 

Many people have the mentality that losing 1k in your first year is nothing so who cares.

1k on 10% yearly return for 40 years is 45k. By doing nothing anymore, just a 10% return on 1k e.g. on the SP500. 

So what's my point? Back to the companies. Great companies are less risky. They are usually solid and at the top or as top player will eventually return in line. Average companies however might fade away or simply fall off. That's also the risk difference of investing into the top vs growth vs small cap. While a shift is normal and 40 years ago only a bare minimum of the top companies today even existed they are the safest and most secure to remain their profits or at least stability even when a pandemic rolls in. And while value doesn't reflect stock price at any given time it usually trends and reverts back to it."

6/29/2021 19:10,stocks,"My entire portfolio is DIS and AMD calls. Dis June 22 calls at 220 and 260 SP.

DIS is worth the current price on Disney+ alone."
6/29/2021 16:21,stocks,I needed some spending money....sorry...
6/29/2021 16:22,stocks,"I got rid of my DIS shares before the last earnings report. It's been tough for me to hold. I like the company, I like Disney plus, love Disney world... but the stock has been underperforming the past 6 months. I'm not sure why. I'm just as puzzled as you are. It seems to be moving in sympathy with travel related stocks."
6/29/2021 16:29,stocks,"If this is expensive, then people should not be buying Tesla, DocuSign, Roku, etc. all these are way higher than their projecting, yet people still are pouring money into them. They may be tech, but Disney is a solid choice at any price below 180 IMO."
6/29/2021 16:28,stocks,"Isn’t every stock overvalued? This one is at least profitable. I mean, let’s look at Twilio, apple, Tesla, DoorDash. Lots of overvalued stocks, yet everyone knows it’s overvalued and still puts money into it."
6/29/2021 17:23,stocks,"What about short term price action? Why did it go up towards the end of last week to go down the last 2 says? Just don’t see enough news to shake it. Not the cruise lines, not the ROCE."
6/29/2021 16:34,stocks,"Which is stupid for it to be. Let’s put this in perspective, they make like 16 billion in rev from theme parks each year. They make 8 billion from Disney plus per year. So they lost out on a year worth of theme park rev, but after reopening they’ll get that 16billion back eventually consistently. So they just added another 8 billion a year and are set to new record highs. And that spells...short and sell the stock? Too overvalued? That doesn’t make sense to me."
6/29/2021 18:31,stocks,It's kind of stuck being in the twilight zone. It's part re-opening stock and part growth stock. It took a hit in Q2 ER because it seemed like it wanted to be a growth stock when everyone wants it to be a reopening stock. Now it's taking another hit because reopening isn't happening soon enough.
6/29/2021 16:34,stocks,"Lol doesnt change the fact its expensive just cause people are pouring money into tesla etc. Different companies. I never said its not a good long term hold, it should be a decent gainer for the years coming. I just dont think it will do much in the short term unless disney + stays really strong"
6/29/2021 19:24,stocks,"Difference is these companies have much more growth built into their valuations whereas Disney's growth is primarily with streaming/direct to consumer. Don't get me wrong I've had my eye on Disney as well, but I'm not buying. Yet. By the way I own Tesla, I'm sure that'll make you squirm in your seat."
6/29/2021 16:57,stocks,"I guess most good companies are overvalued right now, that’s why I’m sat with 70% stocks and 30% cash so I can capitalise on a dip if and when it comes. And if it doesn’t I’m still making money."
6/29/2021 16:42,stocks,That's because the alternative is cash which you for sure lose money every year to inflation and bonds which you lose slightly less money every year to inflation.
6/29/2021 18:03,stocks,"Part of it is because Disney cruises can't sail yet for fear of COVID, as evidenced by RCL.

I bought DIS during today's dip. It might go lower. One potential catalyst would be how well Black Widow does on opening weekend. If it has a strong turnout, then confidence in DIS might return. If not, then I might sell some of my other positions and average down."
6/29/2021 17:38,stocks,"I ultimately don't know but I do know DIS is on quite a few ""long term"" lists and US States are slowly opening back up so it might just be some collective anticipation"
6/29/2021 16:39,stocks,"I hear you. Disney+ generates 8 billion a year right now, and Disney doesn’t have to exactly create tons of new content to keep viewers. They have a huge library of movies they can rotate. I just think their price action this week was unjustified. I see 177 by eow."
6/29/2021 19:33,stocks,"It doesn't make me squirm that you own it, I just think it's price is unrealistic. You can buy every airline and still have money left over for the price of Tesla. That puts things into context.

Also, Disney's growth is based on streaming and media and exclusive sales. Huge following for Disney related gifts, and also for movies and media they produce. Either way, people make tech companies look like they have infinite potential."
6/29/2021 16:59,stocks,2% ROI isn't making money
6/29/2021 16:45,stocks,"Yeah, but I think the swing away from value stocks was an over reaction. Back into tech is fine, but not at these levels. They’re all at all time highs yet, people still think it’s best to buy?"
6/29/2021 18:05,stocks,"sorry, but the cruise line isn't a factor. People keep saying it is but it's less than 4% of their overall profits. Not enough to rock the stock imo. The ROCE comment is also stupid, as it's know how they operate, so why raise the concern now? They literally just pulled 8 billion out of thin air with Disney+. I hope they go up a couple percent tomorrow."
6/29/2021 17:45,stocks,"TBH i think it's just manipulating. There was constant downwards pressure today and it gapped down hard instead of steady downward trend. And when things were moving up, it quickly moved down within a split second. So it's clear that it was being manipulated, just don't know who and for how long. Just hope they have to cover tomorrow or Thursday."
6/29/2021 17:01,stocks,"Eh, we'll see.  

I think the streaming gains we've seen from 2020 are going to start to evaporate."
6/29/2021 16:43,stocks,"Wall streets main focus is disney+, everyone knows the parks are always gonna be a hit. As long as disney+ meets targets/surpasses them it should be a solid pick. Its definitely a better buy now then it was at 190+ like it was before."
6/29/2021 17:17,stocks,I have 70% in stocks that are up a lot in the last 12 month? I use the cash to get good entry points rather than buy at ATH? Not sure why you’re confused
6/29/2021 18:08,stocks,"I mean most people expect there to be a correction when interest rates rise. Interest rates aren't rising yet, so the market is just waiting. I don't think there's a clear direction - in April and May there was a significant correction in technology, such that even blue chip stocks like Amazon and Apple went down more than 10%. But now, that correction's swinging in the other direction. 

Why? Because nobody is sure what's going to happen. Government can raise rates at any time and set off a panic. Bottom line is everything is over valued so the only real ""direction"" is inflation, since if everything costs too much, then it's the dollar that's worth too little. We all know why that is - low interest rates & mass money printing.

The people who get hurt the most in an environment like this are the people who rely on fixed income vehicles like bonds, savings accounts, and social security. They're the ones who are going to see their quality of life drop as the dollar loses value."
6/29/2021 18:24,stocks,"I mean, if you don't want to believe it's partially due to the cruise lines, then that's fine. You are entitled to your opinion. If you doubt it's because the broader market reacted negatively to travel news, then you're just ignoring reality. Airline stocks are down, cruise stocks are down, travel booking stocks are down, cinema stocks are down. Sure, Disney is a conglomerate of many things, but its resorts/theme parks are still a major part of the business. The part that was still hurting in Q2/21. Maybe it's the algos, maybe it's humans, but whatever it is, the stock is down today because the broader ecosystem in which it belongs to is down.

Speaking of Disney+, that's been priced in already. You could go look up the Q1/21 and Q2/21 transcripts or summaries if you have questions.

Seems like you aren't looking for a discussion, contrary to what the flair suggests."
6/29/2021 18:01,stocks,Can always count on insider trading or market manipulation.
6/29/2021 17:10,stocks,"Might as well say the same as Netflix, yet their stock is going up. Disney is at least diversified, so if that area isn’t doing as great, they still have many other places to get rev."
6/29/2021 16:46,stocks,"Yeah, I have stocks and short calls. I’m just curious why it went down today and yesterday on no news. The cruise line news is not enough to jolt the revenue, so just don’t get why there is bearish sentiment. Even the news with Amazon didn’t help."
6/29/2021 18:10,stocks,"Disney will thrive whether there's inflation or not, there's always someone who wants to go or consume their content. It's not even a tech company where they trim their software, there will always be a consistent flow of rev for them in all areas. Even Disney+ will probably reach half a billion in the next 3 years."
6/29/2021 18:38,stocks,"I am looking for a discussion, but more geared towards reasons that actually make sense on news that could swing the stock. If I said streaming movies isn't going to be a thing in an article, do you expect Amazon to dip 1%? Probably not, cause they're filled with so many other products and rev streams that it's negligible for that day. Will it affect them, probably. Is it enough to shift their stock, most likely not. Travel news does play a part, but so far the only area affected for Disney is their theme parks. Disneyland and Disneyworld are like 80% of their park rev. Since both are open and sold out for tickets, i'd say Disney isn't hurting right now from the news. Could they be affected later, yeah, but the action this stock specifically the last 2 days was an overreaction to the already known. At most, i could have seen a half a percent dip, but not a 2-3% dip."
6/29/2021 18:05,stocks,Unless you're on the opposite end.
6/29/2021 17:15,stocks,"Netflix, Viacom, Disney, and Comcast are all in the same boat. 

Consumers are experimenting with having multiple streaming services, but how long is that trend going to keep going?  

Disney is a great company.  I own quite a bit of shares, but my cost basis is in the low 70's.  Like the other commentators here I'd be wary about entry at this price point.  If Disney has some blockbuster movies this summer and fall or a major, major uptick in park revenues I'd take another look, but not right now.  

I feel the same way about all entertainment and game companies"
6/29/2021 18:53,stocks,"There doesn't seem to be that much additional news, so by process of elimination, travel news seem like the most reasonable explanation.

Maybe the market doubts DIS Q3/21 EPS will meet analyst expectations, which seem pretty high, so they're taking bearish position against DIS. Analysts should just treat DIS as a growth stock, then it's P/E will seem cheap in comparison."
6/29/2021 17:22,stocks,"Let’s be honest though, Disney owns their content and lots of kids movies. Parents will always want that, so the steaming service will be around for every new generation. Why did Comcast go up then? Why did Netflix stay stagnant? Disney is more than just streaming. They should be considered a conglomerate that has its hands in all of media and entertainment. It’s def not losing profits, it’s only gaining. I don’t think 200 price tag is justified, I do see 180 justified based on adding Disney+ to their stack last year. It grows at like 20%-30% yearly making 8billion a year right now. It isn’t even launched in a quarter of the places that Netflix has. So yes, I do think 180 is a justified price for future outlook and rev. Unless we throw out that saying, forward outlook. Then all tech should be half of what they are now yet analysts keep raising price targets. It’s all a manipulation game and those with the most money get to control the direction of the stock."

Meanwhile, covid crashed the economy and took everyone by surprise.


Conclusion : you can't tell, even if you have a gut feeling there is no way to say how it will happen and what to do beforehand. So, just keep buying consistently, every month, average down and invest in what you believe. That's all you can really do."

6/29/2021 16:14,stocks,I think there will be a 10 to 15% correction by end of September. I took some profit so that I have 20% cash on my accounts. Total crash > 50% may be unlikely unless we have another lockdown.
6/29/2021 16:47,stocks,"I'm not sure about a crash, but the market will begin to re-price based on signals from the fed (ie. if the fed is buying less bonds, some market participants will eventually move from stocks to bonds). There's a lot of liquidity in the system, so people caught on the wrong side of trades that are over leveraged could cause a ""crash"", per se. Best way to handle this is to dial back on companies that don't generate free cash flow or sell CC (can only do this if you have x100 shares in a company) as a way to reduce cost basis and ease back in after market turmoil. SPY puts can get pretty expensive depending on your bankroll. Something that I'm watching is potential backwardation in VIX (ie. VIX futures expiring in August /VXQ21 are more expensive than VIX futures expiring in September /VXU21)."

Top companies are also no longer considered when investors buy into index funds. Purchases without looking into fundamentals usually creates a bubble, and I highly doubt the market has the cash or demand to support a selloff if people want to convert their large-caps & indexes for cash. 

IMO, we’re due for a major correction. If there’s no market-moving news, probably just a bear market for quite a while. I have FB PUTs that expire in October, and some other negative-beta investments that support the theory. 

To summarize, I predict a crash by the fall, probably once mortgage delinquencies rise."

We're coming out of covid people have money and want to go out and spend it. Businesses and industries are buying materials. The infrastructure bill is going to lift the economy with good paying jobs. The ceo of American express said ""People have more money in their savings account then they have had in the past 20 years""  i.e. they have money to spend. Yeah we some supply chain issues right now but they will end soon enough. I think it's just the start of the boom."
6/29/2021 18:56,stocks,Putting all my money in $amc and &gme because that’s what’s causing the crash
6/29/2021 16:24,stocks,I won’t do anything differently. The stocks that I am holding I will continue to hold through the crash. I have a six month cash emergency fund at all times for hardships. My wife and I’s jobs are pretty stable so if the market drops out then I’ll probably use some of that cash in the emergency fund to load up on stuff.
6/29/2021 17:25,stocks,"I honestly don't know if a crash is ever coming, at least anything bigger than what we saw during the start of Covid. If I we're to speculate, we'd probably see a correction in the form of a bear market for a prolonged period of time or trading sideways. My second speculation would be big players selling off and initiating a chain reaction forcing margin calls to create a cascading effect, thus, your crash, due to people over leveraging themselves during the last year and taking big, big risks."
6/29/2021 17:17,stocks,"No one knows when a crash will happen and anyone who claims they do is full of shit. 

With that in mind, I am buying in every month like I’ve always done."
6/29/2021 18:48,stocks,"I do believe a crash is coming, but I'm already as prepared as I can be. Just diversify. That's the point of diversification is that you hold money in a lot of places, so that if one or more takes a hit, you still have others that maybe weren't hit as bad, and bounce back long term. I have a small amount in a thing I can't mention in this sub (like 3% and I wouldn't start investing in this already risky asset right now), some in a few stocks that tend to do well in recessions, and a lot in savings.  
  
I'm holding a lot of my cash, except for things like my Roth IRA, or my money market, which will come back in a few years, and are long term investments anyway. I have more money than usual in savings. If shit hits the fan, you do need cash, even if inflation hits. Also, cash is king for when you want to buy the dip. If the market does crash, we probably won't see prices that low again for awhile. So buy solid companies on sale.  
  
Secondly, I already hold about 2 weeks of emergency items, and have accumulated them slowly. This is a good standard practice for all emergencies, not just a market crash. You don't need months of supplies, just maybe a week or two extra in case of supply issues. I don't go buy out the store, just get one extra of things I'd normally buy anyway until I have a small stash. Things like Toilet Paper, Shampoo, deodorant, extra cans of chili, peanut butter, crackers, eggs, toothpaste, and non-electrical entertainment."
6/29/2021 17:04,stocks,"I've made my selections, I believe they'll get hit hard, but I believe in them. I trust them. 

That said, I have cash available to buy with once we crush into the ground somewhere, after the dust settles. 

If you don't know how to average down then teach yourself. I learned how with one of my picks, Hyliion. We went from 60 down to just above 8 lol now around 11 to 12 ish and made my money back because of it. Not an expert, you might consider consulting one if you're that nervous about it.

Write down a scenario and then write down what you will do if it ever happens. Repeat for as many scenarios that concern you.

6/29/2021 19:44,stocks,"no. I believe there will be a general stagnation in 2022 like what we say in this first half of the year in the nasdaq, but this year will be overall decent. 

I say 2022 b/c I think that's when the talk of the raising of rates will get serious. 

There will be no housing crash, just staleness and maybe a little pullback.

1. people buying are not like 2007. these people are paying in cash or are only financing smaller loans; have credit scores over 800; and are buying second homes or investment properties. also blackrock is involved in buying now. 
2. almost no new building has occurred, especially in the areas most in need. lumber will come down but not immediately and permitting and construction takes time. once that starts it will increase supply but too slowly to drive prices down much.
3. there are some good articles about foreclosures and evictions, but they all seem to indicate that it's not nearly as bad as many imagine. very few people are actually in danger of losing their homes when it is lifted.
4. interest rates aren't increasing until 2023, they say. that's what will ultimately drive prices back down but it happens slowly b/c the Fed won't want to rattle the whole economy.

Pandemic effects aren't going to be sorted out fully until 2024/25, just based off supply chain bottlenecks that I don't think some investors have respect for. I speak with a man that works for one the largest toy companies in America and they were paying 3,500 for a shipping container from China in 2020 and the price now is 13,000 and that's if they can even get one - THAT'S a huge factor in why everything is getting more expensive and ""inflation"" is the talk. Most of the containers right now are being filled with the most in-demand products (lumber) and extremely packable items (microchips)."

You can see someone everyday calling for a crash. But even if they have the right fundamentals, a bubble can take longer to pop that one can predict.

The fed has alluded to a potential crash occurring in 2022. Goldman Sachs proclaim that if interest rates rise to anything above 1.5%(I may have mis remembered that figure) we could see spy fall by 17% or more. I don’t personally am unsure if the FED will raise rates. Housing is in for a disaster by the start of 2022. I wouldn’t be surprised if people start to default on payments.

6/29/2021 18:43,stocks,"I don't care if a crash is coming. I mean, yeah, I don't want to lose money, but my approach doesn't require me to guess what's going to happen because I have been wrong more than right, and I learned I do worse making moves thinking I can see the future.  The vast majority of my stupid investing mistakes occurred when I tried to guess moves and thought I could be a sophisticated short-term investor. 

So, I set an appropriate asset allocation. Once a year I rebalance to that allocation. That's it. 

If stocks go down and my 70/30 allocation is out of balance, I sell bonds to buy stocks to get back to 70/30. And vice versa. That forces me to buy stocks when they are low and sell some when they are high if I get out of balance from 70/30. 

So when I say ""I don't care"" I mean I never have to change my method no matter what happens to stocks. I just execute my plan. It has worked well and relieved me of the agony of guessing what I should do. Since I am a long-term investor, this works fine.

There could easily be a pullback, that’s why I typically keep 20% of my assets in reserve if I’m nervous about the market. Market drops 5%, I wouldn’t pull from the 20% I have.

6/29/2021 18:17,stocks,"Crashes happen when the real world economy crashes. There was a crash last year as the economy shut down and GDP dropped by double digits. There was a crash in 2008 when human greed and poor regulation led to millions of bad choices regarding mortgages and millions of people defaulted on their loans. Going into the future I don’t see anything in the real world economy that could cause a crash. A correction is very possible 10%-20% as many stocks seem to be over valued. But we could also be on the cusp of one of the largest economic booms in our lifetime. The delta variant is a cause for concern but it also seems like people have learned how to live with Covid in our lives and the economy is humming right along.

Everyday there are people calling for a market/economic crash. Perma bears you can call them. A perfect example is TheMoneyGPS on YouTube. Dude has been crying negative shit about the economy for years and I believed him for sometime during 2018 and ended up just losing money by not investing. They have always existed. But a certain group…… stonkersuper have taken that concept and blasted it into the stratosphere with unbelievable amounts of conspiracy trying to trick people into believing that a crash is coming and that the game store stock is a hedge against it.

I agree with you. Shorts sellers always spread rumors of crash so the Longs can leave their positions. Even if a crash happens in reality, it can't be like the March 17 2020. There was so many going on at that time and then Covid added more stress to it."

6/29/2021 17:01,stocks,"That really depends on if the fed does the responsible thing and raises rates. Which it won't do. When you have a 5x leverage on an asset, and the margin rates are ridiculous, people max out their buying power, as they should. But if rates go up, the buying power is greatly reduced, and that is the only way home values will level off. 

The fed like the housing market going up, because they don't figure housing in their inflation reports, so if the majority of the newly printed money goes into housing  costs, they can pretend that they were right.

The only problem is that bond rates are super low, because the fed keeps buying them at non market prices, even though they are a super shitty asset. Along with ""high yield"" (aka sub-prime) mortgage backed securities. 

It is essentially inflation squared... print money, to buy bad assets, in order to extend credit to bad borrowers, who create more bad assets, that the Fed needs to print money in order to buy."

6/29/2021 19:06,stocks,High inflation will cause an increase in interest rates. Increased rates cause money to flow from stocks to bonds.

6/29/2021 19:54,stocks,"You cannot refinance on a mortgage with multiple late payments within 12/24 months. The problem with equity gain is that is it really hard to access when you actually need it, emergency normally means job insecurity and without verifying they can repay the loan, the banks cannot give them a new mortgage - per the law.

The 2nd mortgage/home equity loan market has dried up due to the massive bubble that we are currently in and those lenders don't want to be in 2nd position and left holding the bag when the values drop and they are underwater... like in 2008. Some homes from 2006/2007/2008 just got back to positive equity and just in time for the next crash. If they weren't able to fix/update the home over the past decade and values drop down again, more than likely they will need a major repair and will end up walking away.

\*Edit - Forgot to mention, those who are in a forbearance (depending on the lender) cannot refinance unless they are current on their payments, or have made 3 payments -on time- with the new modified terms (adding the deferrals to existing loan balance)"

6/29/2021 19:19,stocks,"I hear you, I just think this market no longer plays by the old rules and actually hasnt for quite some time.  

A favorite example of mine is Amazon.  For 10 years all Ive heard is how Amazon is a bad investment because their P/E ratio has been sky high.  And yet Amazon has been one of the best performing stocks of the last decade.

Now you could say that Amazon is an outlier and thus dismiss it as an aberration, but yet there are loads of other stocks doing the exact same thing (TSLA anyone?)  

I'm in the market to make money and if you look at the stocks that are performing well and making money, most of them are not playing by the traditional ""rules"" and as such I don't put an extremely high emphasis on those things."

6/29/2021 19:25,stocks,"I meant like some numbers somewhere. With house prices sky rocketing it is hard for me to picture a ton of people underwater on their houses. 

Why would foreclosures increase because of delinquency if you can sell your house for a profit or roll your missed payments to the end of the loan?"

6/29/2021 17:58,stocks,So are you trying to say that in the beginning of 2008 the housing market had no correlation with the stock market?

6/29/2021 18:14,stocks,"I agree.  They make billion because they have 100s billions.  The percentage of their profit is what people should look at, not the actual amount.

6/29/2021 19:01,stocks,A little inflation might be a net benefit for debtors.  Hyperinflation would be good for none of us.  I don't relish the idea of carting a wheelbarrow of dollars to the store to buy bread.

6/29/2021 19:47,stocks,"In that case a war would probably just be good economics. Get the population manufacturing weapons to stave off unemployment, make young men enlist so they're not causing trouble in your own country, and unite the people with a common enemy that isn't the 1% to avoid a revolution.

A severe, prolonged market crash would almost definitely lead to a war, in my opinion."
6/29/2021 19:50,stocks,"Funny how everyone knows these huge funds are willing to pay asking or above asking for houses, but never consider what that means.  Perhaps they know something you don’t?

6/29/2021 18:32,stocks,"They arent propping up the housing market, they are endangering it. With stupid low interest rates, and high demand, due to millenials reaching the historical average age for first time home buying, demand is through the roof, and the bank thinks the solution is to flood the market with more buyers.

Just last week, Fannie Mae just reduced the minimum credit score for an FHA loan from 580 to 540. They think that they are helping, but they are just creating more false demand for a limited inventory. Sound familiar? Basically, politicians relaxing regulation in order to be the one to say ""look at me, im providing the American dream!"

6/29/2021 17:59,stocks,"Correlation doesn’t equal causation. Not always at least. The point is that just because you saw a trend in the way banks were lending doesn’t mean you predicted a stock market crash. Once again, no one can predict a crash. Anyone who says they can is a liar. If you’re making such accurate predictions, why are you not working on Wall Street making billions right now?"
6/29/2021 17:47,stocks,But with that logic. Isn’t almost every single car company eventually going to be more tech than not?
6/29/2021 17:49,stocks,"Tech films does not mean you're a tech company. Their service isn't tech, they just use tech to do something. Theme parks are packed and tickets are sold out. This is an absolute good sign for Disney, yet analysts won't cover that. 

Analysts want to cover the negative pieces because they were probably paid to do so. Hedge fund pays analyst 500k, says write an article that sounds negative. Hedge fund shorts the stock makes millions. Hedge fund pays analysts to write positive news, hedge funds already covered most, buying stock on the way to pump up their new bags.

6/29/2021 18:11,stocks,I never listen because they never predicted 2008. My feeling is when eviction moratorium is over. PPP and emergency lending facilities have ended. No more stimulus. Continued rising inflation. Naturally occurring or pressure to raise interest rates. Lumber futures have already dramatically corrected. Infrastructure spending will only boost commodities and specific stocks. Then there will have to naturally be a correction. I could add more but just my thoughts anyway

1) You shouldn't use a 7 month time frame to judge a long term investment.

2) Since Tesla shot up over 1000% in a year before being added to the S&P 500 it was probably due to cool off/correct somewhat in the short term.

3) Tesla's 1000% surge is one of the reasons why a lot of people were saying at the time that Tesla probably should have added to the S&P500 years ago. There were some discussions back then if the S&P's eligibility criteria (which was tightened after the dotcom bubble) had become too strict. After all, isn't it strange that you have to be profitable to enter the S&P 500, but NOT to stay in the S&P500? Some people were asking how you can still make promising companies with great long term growth prospects and a clear path to profitability like Tesla of a few years ago eligible while not making giant money losing pits with no realistic hopes of ever achieving profitability eligible."

6/29/2021 12:34,stocks,"It’s a derivative and rebalances daily, so you really get hurt when the market starts to decline or trades sideways.   That and the rebalancing management costs just make it a riskier assets to hold long term, much like options are in regards to time premium.  

For example, QQQ is trading at 355.  If QQQ drops 10% then you leveraged ETF drops about 30%.  The rebalancing means there is less funds available to leverage.  So If QQQ recovers 11.1% it is almost back to 355.  However, your leveraged ETF will still be at a loss of about 7%

At the end of day, the leveraged ETF works as a directional trade, but it will slowly bite away at you in a sideways market, and crush you in a declining market"
6/29/2021 12:23,stocks,"high risk high return

if tqqq existed in 00 crash, to this day, you would still be down"
6/29/2021 19:47,stocks,"Nothing wrong with using these if you buy when it has corrected and sell on the rebound. Use a bit of TA and don’t just buy blindly. Also, just cap your leverage to X% of your portfolio, e.g., don’t go all in when we’re at ATHs."
6/29/2021 15:38,stocks,"> It’s a derivative and rebalances daily, so you really get hurt when the market starts to decline or trades sideways.

Daily leveraged ETFs will underperform over a sideways period, but you are completely wrong about the level of underperformance. Not sure if you actually understand how the actual rebalancing costs work, but they use swaps to get leverage and the cost of that is very low (LIBOR rates), and doesn't have anything to do with options. Your example is also incorrect. If QQQ dropped 10% in 1 day, TQQQ will drop 30%, but if QQQ goes up 11.1% the next day, TQQQ will go up 33.3%, with very slight errors, making the drawdown from rebalancing about 7% (1-0.7x1.33). However this is using a 1 day change of 10%, which almost never happens. What actually happens in real life? QQQ went down about 11% from 02/12/21 and recovered by 04/09/21. TQQQ did go down about 30%, but what was the drawdown on 04/09? Only about -2.9%, not the -7% drawdown of 2 days, and definitely not -22% in your example. This is because although QQQ went down by 10%, it did so without much **volatility**, and **volatility** is actually what determines the amount of underperformance of leveraged ETFs, not simple examples that don't mirror real life situations. The bigger problem is that nobody really knows how TQQQ will perform in the future because not only you have to predict where QQQ will go, but you have to also predict future daily volatility, which can be indexed by something like NDX VIX futures."
6/29/2021 12:36,stocks,Thank you. Good info. I understood the declining market problem but hadn’t looked at a sideways trade over time.
6/29/2021 14:22,stocks,"But if you had DCA over the years instead, you would be massively up."
6/29/2021 12:31,stocks,"Wouldn’t it have taken something like 15 years for QQQ to be back up too though? In a crash like that, the tracked fund suffered greatly too. If you DCA down after a pop, would that help mitigate the immediate losses of the pop as with any other “bought too high” position? Your example would assume you never bought in again. That would hurt no matter what stock you bought if you bought at the peak of a pre-crash scenario."
6/29/2021 19:57,stocks,"Yea. That’s exactly what I’ve been trying to do with them this past year. I bought into both in March of 2020. I’ve bought and sold a little in both since then as well. Currently, my LETF holdings are around 13% in my general play account (not A designated account like an IRA, just general extra savings). LETFs make up about <2% of my whole portfolio."
6/29/2021 16:02,stocks,"You are correct.  I was trying to do the math in my head on the fly and miscalculated.  I agree with the 7% net drawdown on that 33% gain given the lower rebalanced amount in the fund at the start of the day. 

I also know that options are not the derivative for these.  I was just trying to relate to a different type of derivative where a sideways market presents risks to these instruments.  

As far as my scenario, let’s change it up to 30 days of sideways trading.  1/2% down on day one, 1/2% up on day day, and going back and forth through 30 days.   QQQ would be down .53% and the 3x would be 1.81% down (roughly.. probably a little bit more with management fees included).  That is more than 3 times the loss.  Flip the example start with a 1/2% gain and follow with the loss and you end up with a .46% gain in the Qs, but only a 1.18% gain in the 3x.  That is less than 3 times the gain. 

Bottomline, overtime that leveraged ETF is going to underperform.  It will only over perform in a consistent direction move"
6/29/2021 16:11,stocks,"> If you DCA down after a pop, would that help mitigate the immediate losses of the pop as with any other “bought too high” position? 


No. The lots you bought at the top will always be negative no matter how much money you throw at the stock thereafter. That’s why it’s called Dollar Cost AVERAGING. It doesn’t erase your loss."
6/29/2021 12:54,stocks,"leverage cuts both ways

let's use the covid crash as an example (the math doesn't work like this in real life due to daily rebalancing to match 3x gains/losses but im using these simple numbers just to get a sense of leverage hurting you)

qqq: dropped 30% meaning it needed to go back up about 40% to reclaim its high (100 -> 70 -> 100)

tqqq: 3x 30 = 90% meaning it needed to go back up about 1000% to reclaim its high (100 -> 10 -> 100)

now obviously, if you have a super strong tech bull market this doesn't matter but no one can see the future which is why leveraged funds are not advised. if you're young and confident in the bull market of course, leveraged funds are a great resource. it's all up to the individual"
6/29/2021 16:37,stocks,"Agree with almost everything you said, but somewhat disagree with your conclusion. Your scenarios are actually a great way to show how these can work. What you have really shown is that it doesn't actually matter much what the period or drawdown of the index is, the daily volatility is what actually matters for the underperformance. For example in your 1/2 down/up example, QQQ is down 0.53% after 30 days, so a 3x performance should be compared to the baseline -1.59%, and the daily resetting one is -1.81, obviously underperforming. All of that is true and I don't dispute that TQQQ would underperform in any sideways scenario. However, this underperformance of about a month and a half is only -0.22%, in the grand scheme of things and even the daily movement of TQQQ itself, it is not really that much, and basically nothing compared to your first example of a daily volatility of 10%. In fact, if you do this with lower daily movements, but keep the same overall movement, you will see the underperformance go down, but never reach 0.

The reason that it underperforms in a sideways market is also the reason that it will outperform if the index moves up, resulting in daily compounding that can deliver more than 3x the index. TQQQ doesn't really need a consistent direction move, it will outperform in any scenario in which the compounding effect of an index moving up is greater than the underperformance effect from high daily volatility. In a stock market that almost always goes up over time, this can be a great long term bet, provided you chose the right index, even if there are pockets of sideways movements. Daily volatility of indices like QQQ, SPY, DIA (TQQQ, UPRO, UDOW) is actually very low and in real life examples, the underperformance is not really that much, apart from once in decades events like 08 and dot com. Also keep in mind that TQQQ leverages the **nominal** index, so even if a company is worth less in real terms, but not nominal terms, leveraged ETFs can outperform."
6/29/2021 18:13,stocks,Right. The lot at the top will be. But every lot you buy afterward makes it profitability point lower than the top. That’s how it averages.
6/29/2021 14:35,stocks,TQQQ dropped from $57 to $17. QQQ dropped from $235 to $170.
6/29/2021 17:04,stocks,"Is there a situation where the leveraged ETF outperforms the underlying when the underlying ends up back at 0% move?   I’ve run through some scenarios over hundreds of days and can’t find one where the leveraged 3x ends up better when we come back to zero, regardless the volatility swings over the year.  Wherever the Qs bounce around if the YTD change is 0% then the 3x will always be at least a little bit negative, if not a lot"

I am bullish on TDOC and had been for a long time, that is why I held despite being 30% down at one point. But I agree with some of the comments below that TDOC has some inherent risks like missing the next quarterly estimates and how the post pandemic scenario plays out in the near future (I am sure telehealth will be here to stay, but not sure if TDOC will be crowned the winner).

Thus, I have decide to cut my position at least by half. I will put some limit orders now."
6/29/2021 14:57,stocks,I wouldn't invest that much in a company only worth less than $26B.

6/29/2021 12:47,stocks,"It isn't if you're a big believer in the company. Personally, I would not invest that much into something like TDOC. But I'm not you and usually keep my individual holdings in blue chip companies like Apple."
6/29/2021 17:06,stocks,My portfolio is about 15% AAPL.  That's one of the few stocks I'd be comfortable allocating that large a position to though.

6/29/2021 12:56,stocks,"Generally, yes.  I would not carry more than 5% in an individual holding."
6/29/2021 12:20,stocks,"No. If you cannot justify allocating money into something else as opposed to that high-conviction stock, I would continue to use your best judgment and increase your position in your top holding.

I will say, TDOC is a relatively speculative play within this context. I would feel comfortable with 40% of my portfolio in specific blue-chip stocks, and, to me, TDOC does not fit that bill. 

I've been heavily into MSFT for a while and I have a hard time justifying allocation elsewhere a lot of the time. Concentrating assets into a single growth stock does not strike me as reasonable but so long as your DD supports your selection I view that as sound."
6/29/2021 13:02,stocks,"What is your investment ethos? Are you a part of the “diversify” category, or are you a part of the “diversification is for ignorant investors”. Either way.

6/29/2021 13:55,stocks,I have 15% in some stocks. Not TDOC tough although I do hold it.
6/29/2021 14:29,stocks,"Never a good answer for this question so my response is: it depends

For example I have TLRY taking up more than 20% but that's only because APHA shot up so much since I bought it. Is more than 20% too much because the stock shot up? I don't think so.

On the other hand if you're adding to average down a loss, like what you're doing with TDOC, be very careful. You can average it down, but sometimes it can be a money pit where you put more and more money in it but get nothing back. I won't say that 15% is too much because you just turned positive, but monitor the price in case it drops back down.

Off topic, but TDOC seems a bit dicey right now. They've missed revenue estimates for 4 straight quarters. Their report on July 27 could really hurt if they miss again."
6/29/2021 15:02,stocks,"Personally I don’t have any one stock that is more than 15%. That being said in a broker account I own there is a mutual fund that is 20% of that accounts balance. Within that mutual fund it has many stocks so I feel like it is also well diversified.

6/29/2021 15:18,stocks,I think 15% is a bit much for most scenarios much less with a higher risk company. Cut it back by half.

6/29/2021 12:28,stocks,"Agreed. And I stated I felt this was a bit strong. The point is that if you have the risk tolerance for it and trust your diligence there are bigger gains to be made from taking a large stake in a position.


Buffet does do this himself too. In general he would push heavily into positions he had high confidence in rather than spread the wealth around. We saw him do this recently with BoA and Verizon as well as BRK buy backs. That’s also part of the reason that Berkshire sits on such a huge cash pile, the so called elephant gun"
6/29/2021 12:31,stocks,The second part is what I think is valuable here. Of course you should always do your due diligence.

6/29/2021 13:15,stocks,"I tend to agree with Buffet on this one. Diversification won't save you in the long run if you forego DD anyway. If I pick 10 stocks and random.. Some may go up, others may go down. But if I didn't do DD on any of them, it's still down to luck, not DD. DD serves to gauge your conviction in a stock. I don't see a problem with owning a few big positions or many small, as long as you're actually basing it on something.  


Perhaps I'm misinterpreting what people mean by diversity? IF the idea is that many small positions is somehow always better than a few big ones. I disagree with that.  
DD should serve as sort of ""what i expect to happen"". If you don't know what to expect, you can expect financial ruin.

If you look some of their competitors, (GE, Lockheed Martin) and the airline industry (JETS, BA), I still see a correction due for RYCEY. They raised enough Capital to avoid bankruptcy for the next couple years. So unless they start to burn up all that cash runway I will probably stay fully invested."
6/29/2021 15:14,stocks,I sold RYCEY at a loss a while ago because I saw better places to put my money. I think rolls Royce will recover but I decided I didn’t think the reward was worth waiting for.

6/29/2021 12:31,stocks,"I have 2,000 shares for the same reason and I'm down about 5%. I have no idea when it will start moving, but researching the company I find it hard to believe there's much downside and I see a lot of potential upside.

It's also a pretty safe hold, sure you could find a high-growth company and probably net a higher return but if the market crashes then a stable stock like RR is a good hold. With limited risk of further loss."

For me, I used Duolingo and others for a very short period of time before I left it to seek out other resources. It's always great for just starting out and getting you going but it never seems too sustainable."

6/29/2021 13:29,stocks,"I used them for a while but stopped when they made it too easy to level up.  They were too focused on making people feel like they were learning that they crippled the achievement method that actually made you learn.  Instead of increasing the number of lessons you needed to complete per level (it used to be 20 lessons at level 5), they made it 5 lessons regardless of which level so you would gold star a lesson without ever grasping what you were trying to learn.

With the old method, I felt like I was actually learning.  Sure, some people probably complained that it was repetitive doing 20 lessons at level 5, but repetition is the key to learning a language.  By making it 5 lessons you could limp through without grasping anything.

I haven't been back to the app in over a year, but that alone was enough to make me lose faith in their ability to make good decisions.

I'm definitely avoiding this IPO"

6/29/2021 17:34,stocks,"When I was in 9th grade my Spanish teacher introduced us to it. I found it useful to help learn extra grammar or get practice forming sentences, but trying to learn other languages without classroom companion was impossible. 

This feels like where most of their market is from at the moment. I guarantee most Gen Z Americans have used Duolingo at some point if they’re at least in middle school."

6/29/2021 15:04,stocks,Now that’s an idea.. everyone knows spatial repetition works. And it’s really the best way to learn vocabularies. If teachers can incorporate that for vocabulary lessons then it will grab students attention a lot more and be successful. There is much more to say on the failure of the classroom environment for learning languages though..
6/29/2021 16:42,stocks,"It's not useless, but it's limited. I went through the whole Spanish course and came out with clearly a lower rating than they claim (they called it about 60% of the language and the [gauges](https://europa.eu/europass/en/how-self-assess-your-language-skills) I've looked at make it closer to 20%).

Fun on the phone but definitely needs augmentation to fill in the rest.

As a former Robinhood user, I agree with the rest. Don’t use Robinhood, switch to Fidelity. They have a new beta mode in their app that makes it feel like Robinhood but with actual resources and research options to help build your portfolio. Plus they have incredible customer service, compared to RH’s no customer service. 

Also, if you do switch, Robinhood charges $75 to transfer your entire account. Just ask customer service at Fidelity (or other reputable brokers) for reimbursement."

6/29/2021 16:30,stocks,"I'm not saying it's good or bad, just that it is breaking into the education community. Teachers don't use only Duolingo, but I see teachers requiring 30 min of Duolingo/week. Or teachers giving extra credit. Or teachers using it to help catch-up students who were out for multi-week long vacations or illnesses.

I see potential of Duolingo becoming standardized and integrated with education systems"
6/29/2021 18:03,stocks,It is terribly slow with ads interrupting flash cards and you have to use a touchscreen keyboard.  There are no flash cards and even the paid version has long loading animations with the cartoon characters when it should really just move onto the next card.  If you're serious about learning a language the first thing you should do is ditch duolingo.  I'm sure it's very profitable and people like the gamified experience but I don't like it and it's expensive for what it is.  It's very obvious they focus on monetization and they could easily push it too far and lose their growth story.  People were also locked in for the last year and might have used it more than they would otherwise.
6/29/2021 16:56,stocks,"For sure it's limited. So is a translating dictionary. So are conversations. So are conjugation charts.

Each is a tool that helps in a different way. Duolingo is just another tool that I am seeing teachers throw into their tool box for the class.

It's also a really nice tool as a teacher. Because it involves no effort on the teachers part, teachers can have the kids whip out the owl while the teacher grades or is doing one-on-ones.

I'm a history teacher, and if there is an emergency that I have to take care of, or something unexpected happens, I have my kids whip out Newsela and work on that. I always have Newsela, regardless of what grade/age I teach. It's a backup safety net.

I'm seeing language teachers use Duolingo the same way."
6/29/2021 16:45,stocks,"Fidelity beta mode isn’t even close to feeling like Robinhood. They still can’t generate you portfolio charts that only account for gains/losses like Robinhood does. That means if you put $1000 in Fidelity and make $100 and then pull out the $1000 to your bank account, it shows you as losing $1000 where Robinhood would just adjust it to say you have $100 in gains. It also won’t live update through the day showing how your portfolio performed over the course of the day.

I personally use Fidelity because Robinhood is so scummy and it has advantages Robinhood doesn’t, but I don’t think it’s fair to say they are similar."

However, I’m looking at both GOOG & GOOGL and it seems like GOOG is the one that’s at a premium right now and has had more growth.

Which one do you all choose to invest in?"
6/29/2021 10:36,stocks,GOOG is at a premium because they tend to buyback GOOG and not GOOGL. They both trade in enough volume that they’re extremely liquid. The voting rights don’t matter because the founders have not-publically-traded B shares that completely control the company anyways. I bought whichever one the etfs buy. Don’t know which that is.

Now what they do that is annoying is they aggressively send message/email spam to the most trivial headlines they have each day to attract a readership and sell their product. This is where people get annoyed from it. They make trivial message SPAM to get people to click to their website.

Ignoring the trivialization of the Reddit OP title, all the article says is the buyout cleared a regulatory hurdle in the UK. That's real and is just basic news reporting that those of us who already held AMD long-term are interested about. It doesn't say much else.

Last I checked there is a huge uptick so far in the aims of offloading processing onto dedicated specialized devices whether that be Microsoft/GraphCore, Google TPUs, Nvidia/mellanox/ARM, or the entire point of the DirectStorage/IF/nvme progression. The next gen markets are towards dedicated accelerator cards.

There is growth, but limited gains from conventional architectures with far more aims being to move the processing closer to the wire/data. Whether that be GPU/ML/SmartNIC etc... Did you even follow the recent stuff like the recent progressions in tele-conferencing and/or cloud gaming etc..

That doesn't even begin to talk about the other areas such as 5g, defense and automotive which itself are massive markets.

6/29/2021 8:47,stocks,Ah good catch. Thx
6/29/2021 12:33,stocks,"The whole purpose of ETFs is that the redemption mechanism keeps the share price tracking the NAV. For such liquid funds as SPY and VOO, if they deviate from NAV something has gone horribly wrong."
6/29/2021 14:14,stocks,So would it be right to assume VOO will bounce back to the S&P price relatively quickly. Essentially buying a discount? That seems too easy to me
6/29/2021 8:47,stocks,The date the stock trades without rights to the latest dividend. Whoever owned VOO yesterday takes the  dividend. Whoever buys it today doesn’t.
6/29/2021 8:46,stocks,"~~People who own shares on the ex-dividend date will receive dividends on the dividend payment date in the near future.~~

To compensate for this, the share price will decrease on the ex-dividend date by a similar amount as the dividend.

Edited: please ignore this comment and see the other comment.  The ex-dividend date is the date at which it is too late to own the share and still receive the dividends. Sorry!  But the share price will still go down on the ex-dividend date to compensate."
6/29/2021 12:53,stocks,"They do deviate, but will always drift towards the index.  The short term still has supply and demand, altering the price people are willing to buy and sell...   If I'm willing to pay double for 1 share of SPY, who's to stop someone from selling it to me and registering a higher bid/ask?"
6/29/2021 14:17,stocks,"Generally, yes. What you're essentially are looking for is its beta. Spy will have a beta that's almost perfectly pegged to the s&p. Voo would probably be a few decimal points off. Meaning, for the most part,, it should match the market, but not always."
6/29/2021 10:47,stocks,"Just to let people know: there's no mandate to change the price. The MMs open their quotes at yesterday's close minus the payment, and the rest of the market goes along."
6/29/2021 13:14,stocks,"How short of a term are you talking? If your one share bid enters the order book, there will still be millions of bids at the previous price and millions of asks that will be willing to meet them. Your brief overpayment will be a blip on the radar, lasting for one tick.

If suddenly the entire market wanted to overpay for VOO, the transactions would indeed sustain an inflated share price, at which point one of the Authorized Participants would exchange ETF shares for shares of the underlying to bring NAV back in line with the new share price."
6/29/2021 11:53,stocks,"Saying the rest of the market goes along is somewhat disingenuous. Since everyone else is missing the dividends, it's actually more accurate to say that the value to investors has decreased by that amount"
6/29/2021 13:16,stocks,I've no idea. I was talking out of my ass.
6/29/2021 14:59,stocks,"But the value is a fiction the market tells itself in the first place. People are always on both sides of the trading, so nobody really agrees on the value. They trade because of the disagreement."
6/29/2021 15:25,stocks,"Sure, but paying dividends is literally just money leaving the company. No interpretations about it. Otherwise I'd just buy into every high dividend stock right before ex-dividend date and sell right after. Literally free money, no?"
6/29/2021 16:21,stocks,"You literally can. And you'll make bank, because the market usually gets sloppy and discounts the drop due to the div.

However, only qualified dividends (divs that you bought 60+ days before ex-div) get the tax break. So you need to be better at reading div calendars."
6/29/2021 16:26,stocks,"You really can't because the value of the stock drops on the ex-dividend date...if you continued to hold then it would presumably recover but then you're just going long on a stock. 

High frequency trading algorithms would squeeze every last cent out of that so I really really doubt it's worth it for a human investor"
6/29/2021 16:31,stocks,This. There is no money to be made in dividend scalping any more.
6/29/2021 16:38,stocks,"You'll hold it a finite time, so it will run up a little before close after you buy and then again a little after open before you sell. Even if the MM nails the div from open to close the difference to you is a little narrower, so your profit is nonzero.

You should aim to widen that time interval so you get in and out while the price is quieter. That increases your exposure, but exposure averages out."
6/29/2021 0:00,stocks,"New to Biotech Stocks I recently came across SRNE and I read many DDs on it, i can't seem to find someone who comments objectively on it.

I want to learn how to identify weaknesses in a pharma / biotech company, but i cant if 99% of the post i read are people screaming t o the m oo n and sh ort squ eeze in coming. This is getting frustrating, i want to know what im getting into, and to be honest i couldnt give two flying fishes if it s queezes or not... sorry if this comes off as me being lazy and not doing my own DD, but im new to this industry could anyone explain the common downsides or dangers of investing in a biotech company. Maybe using SRNE as an example, with real reasons....

6/29/2021 8:07,stocks,"The downside is they may never discover or produce anything clinically useful, and your investment drops to near-zero."
6/29/2021 8:36,stocks,"Clinical trial data and FDA reports make many aspects of new biotechs, especially being a industry catalyzed by R&D, news driven. This being the reason why you see weekly large spikes and drops in many biotech companies. This scenario is mostly with companies without anything approved for market by FDA. Further DD can be done on companies with drugs already generating revenues. The main factor in successful biotech investing is pouring through the data, which can be overwhelming with so many competing drugs and data pools. I would start by grouping companies by the diseases they address and go from there."
6/29/2021 8:56,stocks,"I’m no expert and this isn’t financial advice especially since I’m still new

However, when I look at biotechs I stick with what I know or think I know. Stuff like well known diseases with great distribution across the population: diabetes, heart disease, etc. And the further I look from the big “popular” diseases and health ailments, the more it’s seems that treatment costs are parabolic and too specialized or niche. 

From a pure statistical view: cancer affects about 19M Americans whereas Diabetes affects 34M. I can’t even count how many cancers there are or the number of possible treatments; I can however tell you there are exactly 2 types of diabetes and the treatments are predicable. Guaranteed insulin and blood glucose measuring for type 1 and an assortment of treatments for type 2. 

Similar lines can be drawn for every condition 

So you have lots to choose from. Make it personal and that’s what you could use to fine tune which companies you want to invest in"
6/29/2021 16:15,stocks,"don’t. If you don’t use bio tech, are exposed to their products, or understand how they work. You’re at a severe disadvantage. Even if you learn you’ll likely never hear or notice small changes.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Kudos to all of you who held through these rough months. Now the question is, where to go from here? For those that have broken even -- do you intend to keep holding, or sell and get out? Are you holding to make a little profit first, or keeping your picks long term?

I intend to keep holding all of mine, but am going to be setting stop losses at the original purchase price if a cushion starts to form. I still like all my picks, even if some of them have high cost averages due to buying in Feb."

So I've recently started investing my money and have about 15k invested in my Money Market Account.

Some funds have given me a total gain of about 14% while others have only given me 1%.

After learning about leveraged stock, what would make investing in TQQQ a terrible idea? If someone could weather the losses short term, and hold it long term, it looks like the most ""reliable"" of the ""very risky"" but incredibly high payoff etf's or stocks out there.

6/29/2021 12:06,stocks,"If you look at their valuation for the past 5 years, they are currently trading a very significant premium.  When I did some small dd on them a while back, I put a buy price on them of 140 based on their 5 year avg p/s and p/e.  

There are a lot of reopening and Disney + expectations priced in currently, so it's very possible they could trade sideways for a few years while earnings catch up.

On the bull side, If Disney + shows very strong growth in the next 2 or 3 quarters, I'd expect the proce to push back towards 200.  I'm not convinced that will happen."
6/29/2021 11:47,stocks,"If you intend to hold longterm then why worry about the past few months?  


DIS is fine, it'll do well for you."
6/29/2021 10:54,stocks,"Be careful with stop losses, dips can be very quick on news over reaction and such, and it's very possible your shares get sold and then the stock price runs away.  

Better strategy would have been to DCA in when your stock choices were down to lower your average cost.  You could have bought a few shares around 72-75 each month since Feb and you'd currently be very up!"
6/29/2021 11:05,stocks,Bruh just hold. Fidelity posted an article saying that their best performing portfolios are the portfolios of their who died and so cannot sell. If the fundamentals did not change since Feb then why would you sell
6/29/2021 11:34,stocks,Both growth and value are winning in this market. Just hold and buy if there’s another correction
6/29/2021 13:07,stocks,QQQ finally exceeded where I bought it. Got it at $340 and watched it sink for awhile. Definitely holding for the long term.
6/29/2021 18:51,stocks,Still holding.  March was rough as shit but now I'm up 50k in the past 3 months.  Big tech is going to continue to post massive numbers and eventually the stock prices will start reflecting that a bit more.

Primarily due to their Aerie underwear/swimwear/athleisure brand that’s growing 80 percent yoy, but also in part due to the upcoming denim super cycle as you mentioned which will help both LEVI and AEO.  I just like AEOs financials and valuation a little better.

6/29/2021 11:08,stocks,"Depends at what price you bought them for and your sell method. 

By default, shares are typically  sold First in First out (FIFO). So the earliest shares are sold first. You can typically choose to sell LIFO, Highest cost basis, or lowest cost basis. Depends on your broker."

6/29/2021 15:34,stocks,Didnt they just apply to get on another stock exchange?
6/29/2021 16:22,stocks,"You are still holding the shares and are susceptible to having the price drop from underneath. The CC would give you a cushion but if you sold at the money and it lost 1% then you wouldn't sell.

Furthermore you are forced to hold onto the shares for longer  since you would have to wait out until the option expired unless you bought to close. Time is money and that money could just as well be re-invested in something else that has time to grow. 

I think selling a weekly ATM is perfectly fine though. It gives you some potential upside and the downside is cushioned"
6/29/2021 18:31,stocks,"Yes I like to buy with CSP and sell with CC if I am trading lots of 100, but you have to be prepared to hold it longer if it drops. If you really are intent on selling then just sell."

6/29/2021 17:07,stocks,"Banks would be more valuable. 

The issue with your question though is this thread will only be up for 24 hours before new one is made. We aren't going to see interest rates increases at the earliest 2022. The more likely time frame though is either 2023 or 2024. So we wouldn't know the answer for months or even years. We might have other stuff to worry about instead of interest rates by then."

6/29/2021 8:11,stocks,Are you generally bullish or bearish?
6/29/2021 15:06,stocks,"For utilities - really depends on the specific sector and where their holdings are.  

Many who operate out west are dropping because of the severe temperatures causing distribution issues and rolling blackouts.  Situation is becoming dangerous and the grid cannot handle it.  Imagine if all those people actually had AC?  Know many who are trying to go solar/battery like a TSLA power wall or similar setup and get out of the grid as much as possible.

Many in the northeast had their shutoff moratoriums from COVID recently extended until this winter, which is then basically automatically extended until spring since you're not allowed to shutoff in winter/cold.  So they might be at nearly two years of back payments due from residential customers.  

If they deal with consumer oil/gas, the continued truck driver situation is impacting them.  Many gas stations in northeast are on an every other day kind of setup now instead of daily.  Combined with more people driving for both going back to work and kids out of school for travel/vacations, it's a downward spiral."
6/29/2021 8:55,stocks,"Quarter over quarter growth was weak, but can be attributed to store closures due to covid quarantine. Q3 will looks good but this q was weak.

I can remember when Krispy Kreme was huge back in the early 2000's but I've never seen them regain that type of hype. For my tastes, KK is far inferior to donuts from Dunkin.

I hope you come out in the positive if you buy the stock, but I'm definitely avoiding it."

This is not financial advice, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night."
6/29/2021 12:39,stocks,Not if you think there are gains to be had elsewhere. If that movement holds you can set a price target and buy back in if it starts performing the way you’d like

I can't predict the future, but this is one of my high conviction companies.  There is a chance that this stock could run higher after the split.  It is that well loved by everyone.  Then there is the ARM acquisition catalyst that could go either way.  The semiconductor sector seems like the place to be and I don't sweat about buying the best of breed company in a sector.  I believe growth will come from data centers and AI chips."

6/29/2021 16:58,stocks,Not too late. SWBI took three days to gap up all the way. POWW will probably head to $11 the next three days. It literally crushed earnings and is pumping in revenue.
6/29/2021 11:55,stocks,Its like buying puts on America.
6/29/2021 12:36,stocks,Smart to wait on it to dip and if it does I will add to my position. I watched this stock for about 6 months before  buying it when it dipped hard during pandemic. I’m sitting at $86 cost basis so I’ve enjoyed the ride so far!

So if I’m understanding correctly, you sell cash covered puts when you’re looking to buy a stock in 100s?

Do you mind explaining what is the advantage of doing this?"
6/29/2021 17:28,stocks,Not really. Stocks went down 2% per day for a few weeks in 2018. It wasn't a sudden drop.

6/29/2021 19:49,stocks,"Well, it's almost the same thing as a covered call actually. On a covered call, you are saying that if the stock doesn't go up, then I make some money anyways, and you lose if the stock goes up a lot. For a covered call you should be comfortable selling the stock at the strike and holding below the strike.

for a cash secured put, if the stock doesn't go down, you still make money, and if it goes down below the strike then you get to buy it at a cheaper price than the day you opened the trade. You lose if the stock goes up a lot because you would have gotten more just owning the stock. You should be comfortable buying the stock at the strike and OK having the stock go up a lot but not make that much on it.

Really either way you lose if the stock goes up a lot or down a lot, and win if it doesn't move much. look at something called the 'wheel' strategy where you just keep going back and forth between CCs and CSPs. It works if you are long a stock that you don't expect to move quickly.. something like AAPL for example. I have been wheeling BAC for the last few months."

But it doesn’t have to. It’s just market forces at play, and investors taking into account the fact that they will not be entitled to the dividend so they lower their bids by as much. However if there is some other catalyst, the stock price can go up on ex-dividend day too.

So I’m not sure why VOO could be up for the day but ur portfolio was down.

Unless you meant that the S&P 500 was up but VOO (the etf) which tracks it was down by the dividend amount. Which makes sense."

>A great company is not a great investment **if you paid too much for its stock.** You’re just paying for its popularity contest, **not the value of the business represents.**

Every time I say that certain hyped stock is overvalued and they’re overpaying for growth, they automatically downvote because they don’t want to hear the truth.

And when the company keeps losing money and its reinvesting in capital, equity, and asset can’t catch up easily from the hyped price, they always use Amazon to justify it. It’s like every stock that loses money nowadays is Amazon.

Plus, by spreading too much, you can't put enough into the companies that you are knowledgeable about.

Upd: I'd like to expand here to explain my opinion. It's an important factor, but definitely not the most important one, and of course there are exceptions. For example, a company hires contractors to do 90% of the job and thus their number of employees is low. But in general huge cap with very few employees might indicate some scam - take a look at Tether. Then low number of employees might mean that some important areas are overlooked - for example, maybe it's a software company and their product is great, but they do not have security engineers. And also there is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor, the company might decline quickly if even a couple of employees leave it"
6/29/2021 15:47,stocks,"What a great question. It is genuinely difficult to find such truths.

My try:

Most people believe indexing is good, but the truth is its bad, because:

1. Eventually only people with the right temperament stick to only indexing (50 years ago, these were probably the people who bought gold and hoarded it).
2. It gives people a false belief that they will be rich when they retire. No they won't.
3. The true purpose of indexing is not to create wealth, it is to preserve it once you've already made massive amounts of money.
4. Indexing will only make your grand-babies rich because on a middle class income that's the  amount of time it will take. Not even your children, and they can't actually enjoy all that money which will be compounding slowly but inexorably. So if you want a billionaire grand-baby, start indexing like Mr. Buffett says.
5. It puts too much attention on the stock market, with its publicity and investor-harming incentives which have now had access to years of research on how to influence the human brain. Instead, people should be focusing on finding the one skill where they are slightly better than others and have a natural edge. This will ensure they understand things faster in that field and progress more easily. This also means they will love their job and find greater happiness and satisfaction in life. I believe people will then not care too much about all this business of making huge amounts of money, because they will already have most of what they want (with love and affection from trusted people).
6. Anything which becomes mainstream sucks because now all the advantage has gone out of it due to the law of unintended consequences."

In reality, every position I have that is up a large amount was purchased during a downturn or dip on the individual stock, most in late 2018 - early 2019 and then March - Oct last year.

Why on Earth do people think they can mathematically prove that it's better to buy now and watch it flounder and most likely go down rather than waiting for down weeks?  Doesn't make sense even when you do the math.  For example, I patiently waiting to buy more JPM and lo and behold I only needed to wait a month and then it dipped 10% to $148. And this keeps happening every few months on most stocks (though usually the drop is 5-7%.   People will shoot out vague platitudes like ""compounding"" without thinking that not much is compounding when the DJIA hovered in the same territory for 3 months, like we've been seeing!  People will unironically say it's best to buy know even if the stock continually dips 5-7%.  Like...what????? I am in this to make money.  Not just rush cash into my brokerage account

Tesla is going to repeat what CISCO/Intel/MSFT did in 2000 is my guess. Great company in an unestablished industry"
6/29/2021 11:56,stocks,How about ETF's?
6/29/2021 15:40,stocks,Yeah i have like 20% in a total market etf mainly to compare my performance versus beta. Then ive got 10 stocks for the remaining 80%. 10 because i really like all of them and couldnt choose which one to sell when adding the 9th and 10th. Wont add new names before removing one now though
6/29/2021 8:11,stocks,"What I have learned after five years of investing/trading (Making 2260.0% total returns over that period) is that:

1. Concentration builds wealth, diversification preserves it. Better to have conviction and large allocations to a few stocks rather than 10+. You will hardly get wealthy that way. Plus it's easier to manage.

2. The greater your risk, the greater your reward. Obviously only risk what you can afford to lose, but If you're only putting up $100-$1000 (for some that's all they can afford), don't expect to make millions. 

3. Keep your emotions in check. Fear will make you lose money and opportunities. If the underlying thesis for your investments remains intact, why are you fretting short term price actions?"
6/29/2021 9:27,stocks,"Sure, it works well until it doesn't. Short term pure luck means you'll win if toy pick a few companies...long term not so much. A majority of the whole market movement is thanks to *a handful* of companies and missing one or two is enough to underperform.



Sure, nowadays it seems easy enough to say ""tech"" and pick winners. But big companies do fall, or trade sideways. You'll not be a rich buying what's hot now, you need to find tomorrows winners before they're big/established. Or simply buy the index and you'll never fail. Or buy 2-5 companies and hope Lady luck is on your side."
6/29/2021 8:55,stocks,"Well you don't *need* a diversified 1.5 mil portfolio either, it just reduces your risk profile. You're okay with the potential decimation of your portfolio, some others may not be."
6/29/2021 10:54,stocks,I think it’s always much better to be concentrated than diversified.Even if you have a billion.Nick sleep ran a fund that did 20% yearly and at the end when it had 3 billion AUM he only owned 3 stocks.The thing is great investment opportunities are very rare so why would you put your money in the ideas that aren’t the greatest?
6/29/2021 11:55,stocks,Do you just stick with stocks and stay away from ETF's
6/29/2021 8:48,stocks,Hello from Instagram
6/29/2021 9:11,stocks,"You say “shouldn’t” but what you mean is “I don’t understand how companies with 50 employees can have a multi billion dolllar market cap”

Your lack of knowledge on a topic doesn’t mean that a counterintuitive event can’t happen.

People make this mistake all the time.  If a company has 50 employees and makes a shitload of money with growth ahead of it (which is entirely possible in this day and age with technology) it can definitely be worth billions.  Your belief on whether it should or should not have that valuation does not really matter."
6/29/2021 9:06,stocks,"I agree with you but I'd lessen it's importance every year from here on out, every job is at risk with automation. Last year I wouldn't have said that but I follow the legal field and I'm shocked at that level of automation. I wouldn't have guessed that ten years ago."
6/29/2021 11:56,stocks,"This is the first one I've read that really makes me scratch my head. 

I view it 100% the opposite way. Employees are a liability, a company that makes $10B with 50 employees is better than a company that makes $10B with 1000 employees. 

It's also part of my bullish thesis on WMT and AMZN. Hopefully automation allows them to cut their payroll substantially"
6/29/2021 14:44,stocks,"They’re not supposed to be better or worse, they’re just used for different goals and motivations than you may have."
6/29/2021 9:05,stocks,"Dividends aren’t absolutely useless, but they are the least efficient method of earnings payouts.  Capital investments, R&D, and stock buybacks are all more efficient than dividends.  And the fact that the culture of dividends is such that they need to be increased every year and should not go down in bad times makes them extremely dangerous as well.

Some dividend stocks can get away with this, like REITs, but companies like IBM and T are wrecked by their rich dividend payouts.

But on the other hand, reaching that elusive 20% yield on cost number is pretty fucking awesome.  LOL.  A bond can’t do that."
6/29/2021 10:47,stocks,Dividends are important in some companies.If a company is earning 30% on capital they definitely should not be paying out a dividend because it would be far more advantageous to reinvest.However if there’s a company that returns 3% on capital.Reinvesting more that needed is harming your returns and is a bad choice.
6/29/2021 8:14,stocks,Who is disagreeing with you on this?  I mean they aren't absolutely useless but I don't think anyone is saying high dividend stocks are a strong growth play.  They say the opposite in fact.
6/29/2021 15:58,stocks,"The modern market seems to agree with you, and values dividends very unfavorably. I tend to think dividends are undervalued by the market. I think there’s something reassuring about a company that can afford to distribute real money to its shareholders, especially with the insane multiples you see so many stocks trading at today."
6/29/2021 11:59,stocks,You should look up the total percent of s&p returns that came from dividends. I see this mistake often. The problem is that you're looking at div yield which is dependant on price
6/29/2021 9:44,stocks,Yeah I had some crazy GME returns (%) but total dollar amount wasn't even noticeable.
6/29/2021 10:50,stocks,Investing is about compounding.an annual 50% gain on 1k over 10 years or so will work out to much more money than 10% on 10k and is you go another ten years the difference becomes huge
6/29/2021 12:52,stocks,"Only if you invested and had the capacity to invest in either here. 

If your 10 times richer than I in the first place, then my 50% is most certainly more impressive. The problem with social media / reddit is you don't actually know most of the time what these people are truly working with, outside new people who will often offer that up. Some of the WSB people for example will ""YOLO"" 50k ... but really it's out of a 5 mil stack."
6/29/2021 14:46,stocks,How so?

6/29/2021 12:01,stocks,"I think MSFT is seriously overvalued 

I think AAPL is a little over valued 

And AMZN isn't too crazy, but still pretty pricey."
6/29/2021 14:45,stocks,MSFT is reasonably priced right now.
6/29/2021 7:12,stocks,Go ahead and short them then
6/29/2021 7:52,stocks,Well the only ways they gonna be 1/2  their current price is either another black swan event appear or those mentioned companies are no longer great and become a value trap.

6/29/2021 16:02,stocks,"That’s categorically false and is a falsehood pushed by people hawking ETFs or passive investment strategies.  

Kudos to you Vanguard for spreading this all over.

Most money managers *net fees* are unable to beat an S&P index.  

That is the fact that is so often twisted around.  There are lots of reasons money managers would rather slightly underperform the market *net fees* than try to blow it out.  You don’t take on additional risk for a blowout year when that 3-5 percent fee is a gravy train."
6/29/2021 16:04,stocks,Based on what source?
6/29/2021 7:28,stocks,">Index ETFs are a bubble

They are just the value of the underlying which is priced by active trading. I don't understand how this could result in a bubble especially since the vast majority of capital in the market is not invested passively in such funds."

6/29/2021 9:10,stocks,"It doesn’t even take a crash, all it takes is some modest declines in revenue CAGR and the value of these growth companies plummets. 

The value baked into so many of these growth companies is all based on future growth. If that growth slows down a little bit, the values sums don’t work."
6/29/2021 12:13,stocks,…..which is why the market only compensates you for bearing **systemic** risk (you sort of described what beta is in relation to CAPM). Idiosyncratic risk (eg the risk that iPhones become unfashionable or the risk of a foreign government nationalizing AT&Ts fixed assets) is not risk you can expect to earn a return on because it can be……diversified away.
6/29/2021 8:32,stocks,Everyone always says dividend companies survive crashes but they don't. Their value always fucking tanks and they usually take even longer to recover than growth. The last two crashes have proven as much. The excuse people always make is they'll use it to buy more but I'd rather have a company that will rebound quickly than one that will take indefinite years to recover my cost basis.
6/29/2021 8:27,stocks,"Your reply is confusing. The phrasing indicates disagreement, but your points align with the comment you replied to."
6/29/2021 15:57,stocks,"T lost a higher percentage of its value than AAPL both during the financial crisis, and during the COVID crash.  

During the tech meltdown of the early 00s it lost 60 percent of its value compared to 70 percent for Apple.  

I don’t get why you’re talking about T like it’s recession-proof.  It absolutely gets ripped during market crashes, and unlike Apple it recovers slower."
6/29/2021 10:17,stocks,"“Expected” returns? What prevents you from investing based on guaranteed returns? We all know the answer, of course: there are no guarantees.

If you’re buying in without absolute certainty of returns, you’re still speculating. Make no mistake, *all* investment is risk-reward speculation. At best, we get more data (reports of past actuals) upon which to form more likely expectations."
6/29/2021 19:26,stocks,"But, if you believe the all stocks are overvalued except one, and that one is perfectly priced, you should still invest in it. Otherwise you are missing out on the market entirely. If you are correct than over years would still beat the market"

When people talk about missed opportunities, they often don’t discuss it relative to the alternative opportunities for that money.  When thought of it this way, anything that has returned less than 320% since 2010 is arguably a bad investment.  You could have returned that much by simply investing in an S&P 500 index (total growth including dividends).  That’s opportunity cost for you."

6/29/2021 9:50,stocks,"Yeah but with 1.5 Million dollars i'd deal differently than with 10k. With 10k I'm looking for stable and quicker growth by making shorter trades (1 day- 2 weeks).

6/29/2021 12:14,stocks,Yes. I totally don't invest in any etf. it's way riskier but the reward may also be way bigger.

Even when considering a couple of % dividend yield. It's common sense actually."
6/29/2021 13:06,stocks,"No, that does not change anything. Or do you really think that the total return on Apple stocks would be higher if their dividends was 10%/year? More likely even to the contrary."

6/29/2021 8:40,stocks,I never understand this comment. A good company being overvalued does not make it a good candidate for shorting. I think people don’t understand that vastly overpaying for a quality company might make your investment go nowhere for 10 years but it might not crash down at any point.
6/29/2021 12:53,stocks,"That goes for every company.

And a black swan event is a carrington event, a nuclear bomb, yellowstone, san andreas, a huge unlikely crisis of some kind. A bear market is not a black swan event, it’s just the market cycle, but it sure as hell would half the price of AAPL or MSFT."
6/29/2021 11:28,stocks,"I downvoted because these opinions are based on institutions and not individual investors. To keep it simple, you're comparing apples to oranges.

6/29/2021 14:32,stocks,"Not really. There is no one formal definition.  Especially now that we have trillion dollar market caps.  Now before you respond, let's acknowledge the Redditor's habit of doubling down until the end of time no matter what. I've been in asset valuation for over 20 years, and the only place i've ever had ppl insisting ""no, microcap is this."",etc is on reddit.  In the real world, again, there's no one set definition and microcap is often referred to in that size range. I've been studying risk and return based on size for like 20 years now.  Ok, that's my response. Will be interesting to see if you're gonna do what 99% of redditors would do and just keep doubling down, or if you'll be one of the exceedingly few big enough to simply concede my point."
6/29/2021 18:18,stocks,This sometimes leads people to averaging down. Several times.
6/29/2021 9:17,stocks,"You’re taking a rather short term view of things… the last two crashes aren’t gospel truth on how this will go in the future. 

The value to a long-term investor of a dividend stock doesn’t actually move in a crash, if the dividend is safe. The cash flows are the same. 

But any stock which is overvalued as in its discounted future cash flows don’t match its current valuation, well, that’s fucked. When you buy a company you are buying a set of future cash flows. The more you pay now, 

When companies are described as being overvalued, at least in a rational way, they are referring to current EV vs discounted future cash flows. If the answer to that is negative, then in the long term, you aren’t going to make a profit. Unless you expect speculation to continue indefinitely, which is silly."
6/29/2021 8:30,stocks,I'm saying you are doing fundamentals not past performance. There are other things that inform our prediction not past performance.
6/29/2021 10:43,stocks,"All risk reward is not equal. To claim otherwise is silly.

And I don’t know how to have a rational conversation about investing if we don’t talk about expectations. How else are we suppose to discuss this? 

It is objectively true that if the internal rate of return is negative on a stock purchase vs the most optimistic analyst’s expectations of future cash flows associated with that company, you will not make money on it in the long run. You are left with short term speculation as your only means to make profit."

6/29/2021 12:09,stocks,"Yes, if you're trying to make a lot of money quickly. ETFs are a perfectly reasonable place to park your money for relative safety and have returns greater than savings or a CD. I plan to invest in some after I reach a certain level (hopefully soon 😉)."

However, based on the deal terms, each employee generated roughly $77m in revenue. I’m sure you’ll agree those are huge numbers. Well, and today, you know how it turned out. Instagram alone would be valued at over $100bn. So saying that a company with <50 employees shouldn’t be valued in billions is too shortsighted.

6/29/2021 10:58,stocks,Yeah buybacks are better because they aren’t taxed twice like dividends.More often than not managements do buybacks after the price has gone up than down but both are great.Buybacks are probably better.But dividends aren’t useless.
6/29/2021 8:30,stocks,"Weird.  I mean saying dividends are useless is wrong.  But saying there are better long term plays than dividend stocks or that dividends don't matter if you're looking for long term growth is obviously not wrong.

Such is reddit though."

But if you were a value investor, a nice sustainable dividend in an established business can be an attractive prospect."
6/29/2021 13:43,stocks,"If aapl div yield hit 10% tomorrow it's either because the share price crashed or they 15x their profit and dividend. If they increased their earnings and dividend the share price would increase and you would be here complaining about low yields again.

This is one of the more interesting threads imo, because it makes you introspect on why you believe the things you do and hopefully makes you question a incontrovertible truth you might hold.

Maybe one day it'll all come crashing down and those fair valued companies will seem good, but something tells me those companies are going to tank with everything else on that day, just as they did the last two crashes, and they'll take forever to recover, just as they did the last two crashes.

6/29/2021 14:35,stocks,"That's really an opinion. If you don't want to make individual picks for whatever reason, yes, this guarantees you get bare minimum market returns, but if you're serious, and you're young enough that the 40 year timeline is valid, it would be a great disservice to be too heavy in this. it really only takes 1 good year of stock picking to forever distance yourself from these all-caps.

Just for example, if you bought vti 5 years ago you're up 107%, very respectable, mutual fund who? What's a GIC?

The top holdings in vti, and as you imagine the largest companies in the world, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon. Each of those over the same 5 year interval has returned 370-450%. That same return over the backwards looking chart for VTI would require you to have entered near the bottom of 2008 crash, or sometime 2001-2002. 

Choosing any of those companies back then is obviously a moonshot, but it was a different time. People weren't sure about this whole internet thing, it was not obvious. 5 years ago, any schmuck would agree that those companies are behemoths that make revenues and profits on the order of countries. 5 years ago, they were an obvious pick. Today, they still are.

So yea, VTI and similar provide the bare-minimum return one should expect from the market, as you say, it's that easy. 14% annualized forever, not individual picking, so you can't be blamed for losing money. But just glancing at any of the individual top names shows just how slow of a lane you're in.

6/29/2021 12:00,stocks,"This is true. If we assume all the etf folks are buy and hold whatever the price, only the new capital inflow (net inflow) to something like SPY would be putting pressure on the price, although shares ""held"" by the ETF would reduce available shares to trade (again assuming ETF people just buy and hold for simplicity). At the extremes where you have like an overwhelming majority of passive investors, it's obvious to me that you can have price mismatches/dislocations, but it's way less clear when that happens

But also, is any amount of continuous buy side pressure on a stock enough to start increasing the price? I'm imaging that all the holders of a stock have a sell price, so there's a distribution of sell prices and then a frequency of people who want to sell at each price. If we assume that people are putting money (on average) into SPY everyday with the logic that it will always go up in the long term and ""time in the market"", etc, overtime, won't they slowly buy out the most bearish part of the distribution of shareholders and increase the stock price? Basically, if passive investors are share price inelastic and won't sell in response to perceived price dislocations, doesn't this ""irrationality"" and price insensitivity eventually lead to inflated prices?"

All-cap is literally average market movement, by definition. If you strive for average, look no where else. If you want to make more money, you can't do it there. 

Again... I'm not saying they are bad. I think everyone should be in an all-cap at minimum, but I would encourage people to be pragmatic, and perhaps decrease stake in it to make your own personal conviction call. If you notice you are not at least matching VTI year over year, certainly reevaluate, but I believe, along with many others, that picking individual companies is always worth it, and we have the records to prove it.

Why would any investing firm even exist, if Index is always best... it is best for *some* people, but far from everyone and certainly not fact.

Stock picking is not some lottery, these are business with cash flows, development, etc.. to think it is impossible, or hard enough to not try, to distinguish good from bad, is ridiculous.

Index forces you to buy the losers with the winners. Again, aapl, msft, amzn. Could you not see that 5 years ago? Do you think people are better off thinking it's too risky to own such incredible companies? They'd be better of blindly spraying their capital across the field?

It does seem to be more strict in the USA and most sites advise to wait 31 days no matter what, however fail to advise if there is a large movement when it may be possible to rebuy the stock without losing the tax concessions.


Example:
I buy a stock at $12

It drops to $10 but I think it will drop further so I sell

The stock then drops to $5

Can I repurchase the stock and still claim the tax loss of $2 per stock or is it still considered a wash sale?

Is there a percentage movement that is considered enough of a material change to rebuy?"
6/29/2021 5:44,stocks,Yes it is a wash sale. It’s all about time. In fact you will receive a wash sale if you sell a portion of your shares within 30 days after buying the stock. Example you buy 10 shares at $5 it drops to $4 the next day you buy 10 more. A week later it drops to $3 and you sell the first 10 shares. That is a wash sale. You can not claim that $2 loss per share of the original 10.  Now if you sell all the shares I do not believe it’s a wash sale UNLESS you rebuy within 30 days. 30 before and 30 after.

Romeo Power's stock was heavily beaten down after revising down 2021 revenues because of cell supply shortages that affected the entire EV market. It appears these cell shortages are being addressed and could allow them to get back on track with forward revenues- some EV related stocks have already recovered, but RMO has been left out of the recent run. On May 13th, the company announced they had made major updates to cell supplier agreements and were ""Shortly signing a deal for multiple gigawatt hours with a top tier supplier"" - Lionel Selwood, CEO. It has been over 6 weeks now since this statement, which drives me to speculate that ""shortly"" is almost here, especially with the management addition announcement on June 16th for their new CFO, Kerry Shiba - who has managed Billions of dollars for several decades, and has helped many companies outperform. 

&#x200B;

Speaking of ""short,"" the current float is 24% shares short, as the company is barely 25-30% off of its all time lows of $6.60, and over 80% off of its all time high of $38. Mind you, this company has deals to produce with PACCAR and BorgWarner. BorgWarner is also a major shareholder in the company. This is a legit and well resourced company that seems to have taken a series of overreaction hits the last several months. 

&#x200B;

Vanguard recently added over 7.5m Shares in their index funds on 6/1, and now own around 15M shares out of the 94M available in public float. BlackRock is also in on this with atleast 2M shares. The company was also included in the Russell 3000 on June 25th. Most analysts have an average fair value of $12-15, implying 45-80% upside from current price. We've seen this ticker jump over 50% in one day on April 6th and I don't think that was the last time we'll see that, and I think if we do get cell supplier news with a ""top tier supplier"" Panasonic, LG, BYD, or any of the giants which are mostly Asia based-  this time the gains might truly stick, as a solution to the cell supply shortages are the looming piece of news, that I'm sure Romeo's management knows, will shift the investor sentiment entirely. 

&#x200B;

Again do your own DD but most of what I've stated here are just observations available to the public yet not heavily discussed. TLDR; Romeo has Moon potential and the stars are aligned for it to happen sooner than later."

If I buy a call option for Apple with a July 2nd expiry and a $60 strike price, what is the risk assuming I fully plan on executing that option? Wouldn’t that just give me the right to buy 100 shares of Apple at 60 dollars for a ~7000 premium? 

Is that not guaranteed bread?"
6/29/2021 0:37,stocks,Where are you seeing $60 strike? The lowest is $65 at $70 which is $135/share. Apple is already trading at $134
6/29/2021 0:38,stocks,Umm technically nothing is stopping you from doing that but you aren't likely to find one that cheap and it would be 60 dollars per share you have to pay to close it out.

6/29/2021 5:02,stocks,Im 100% not sure but I guess there could be transaction fee benefits for some people and also allow you to buy with less cash in the short term if you are expecting money to come in. Likewise if it is on margin you pay less in the short term
6/29/2021 0:38,stocks,"Maybe I’m missing something but it would be $60x100 + $7000 = $13k. Based on current stock price of $134x100 = $13400.

6/29/2021 1:00,stocks,"Yeah the Jul 2 60 strike doesn't exist as far as I can tell, it's the $65 for $70 like you said, which makes sense for a short-dated expiry on something trading near $135."
6/29/2021 0:42,stocks,And option prices change drastically at market open so tomorrow morning the price you're seeing could be another 1000 dollars which would put you in the hole if you exercised it. Plus you have to find someone that is willing to sell an option that deep in the money.
6/29/2021 0:43,stocks,The cheapest  itm apple call I can find right now is a 65 dollar strike so the cost of the contract plus exercising it is actually a net loss of about 200 bucks.

**BULL ARGUMENT**

Iridium has the largest constellation and orbits closer to Earth than any other networks. This allows for shorter network registration times and low communications latency. Globalstar only has [48 satellites](https://sbs-satbill.com/globalstar-billing-platform/) and *does not* cover the poles. Specifically, Globalstar only has coverage [between the latitudes 70 north and -70 south](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1023/A:1019164909332).

In addition to having more satellites and more coverage of the Earth, [Iridium was certified](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/worlds-first-truly-global-real-time-maritime-emergency-service-launched-by-iridium-301193130.html) to use in the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System in December 2020. This ended a monopoly that had previously been held by Inmarsat since the system started in 1999.

Iridium is already a top key-player for global maritime satellite communications. The respective market was valued at $2.39B in 2021 and is [expected to reach $3.96B in the next 5 years](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/global-maritime-satellite-communication-market-2021-is-expected-to-register-a-cagr-of-69-with-top-countries-data-industry-size-share-business-growth-revenue-trends-market-demand-penetration-and-forecast-2021-06-15). That is a CAGR of 6.9%.

Iridium just secured a [$30M R&D contract](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iridium-awarded-30-million-research--development-contract-by-the-united-states-army-301318757.html) with the United States Army to develop a payload to provide more effective sensor-to-soldier data transmission when in the field. Matt Desch, CEO of Iridium, commented on the contract, ""This is one of the largest engineering contracts in Iridium's history... It also represents another phase in the evolution of our growing relationship with the Department of Defense."" Moreover, the U.S. Department of Defense has partnered with Iridium for more than 20 years and is the largest customer. In September 2019, Iridium secured a [7-year, $738.5M](https://spacenews.com/iridium-lands-seven-year-738-5-million-defense-department-contract/) contract with the Department of Defense for unlimited use of the Iridium satellite constellation.

Iridium completed a [$3B multi-year constellation upgrade](https://investor.iridium.com/2019-02-06-Iridium-Declares-Victory-3-Billion-Satellite-Constellation-Upgrade-Complete) in 2019, replacing all satellites and upgrading the supporting ground infrastructure. To complete the upgrade, eight Falcon 9 rockets were used to launch 75 satellites into low Earth orbit ([66 operational, 9 in-orbit spares](https://www.roadpost.com/iridium-satellite-network)). Final payments to SpaceX for those launches were made during the second quarter of 2019.

**BEAR ARGUMENT**

Iridium relies on single-source suppliers for the manufacture of most of the subscriber equipment, and purchases parts that are periodically subject to shortages. There is a large reliance on a few significant customers, particularly U.S. government agencies meaning a loss of that business will significantly impact revenue. Moreover, Iridium relies on a single primary commercial gateway and primary satellite network operations center.

Last, but not least, Iridium is in debt. Specifically, [$1.39B as of March 2021](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/telecom/nasdaq-irdm/iridium-communications/news/does-iridium-communications-nasdaqirdm-have-a-healthy-balanc). Iridium also has liabilities of $88.3M falling due within a year and liabilities of $1.81B due beyond that which outweigh the cash and short-term receivables by $1.62B.

**CONCLUSION**

I'm bullish on Iridium and I only see good things for the long term. Although in debt, I think Iridium can handle the current debt levels. They continue to be the front runner for government contracts and are the only provider that covers the entire globe. From December 2019 to December 2020, Iridium saw an increase of 176K subscribers (14%) and I believe this will continue to grow. Voice and data, and IoT revenues have historically generated higher margins than subscriber equipment revenue, and this trend will likely continue. The diverse customer base including end-users in land-mobile, IoT, maritime, aviation, and government will continue to grow overtime.

That'll bring my NVDA down to around 5% portfolio.  Is this a good move?

NVDA isn't some Saas stock with recurring revenue or easily scalable business. They've tripled revenue and profits in 4 years but price has gone up 6x so half of their rise has been due to valuation multiple expansion, not actual fundamental performance. 

Can it double again based on nothing? Absolutely. Just look at Tesla. Is it technically a good investment at this price? Probably not. This is also the era of Nike at 70 P/E while FB/GOoGL trade at 20-25 free cash flow. Things are weird."

Low rates and wealth inequality is the perfect storm for this type of stuff because cash doesn't matter. 

I in no way think these companies are bad but I also don't fool myself into thinking buying NVDA/TSLA/AMD/NKE and others at these valuations makes any sense. Their models/companies are amazing but they just aren't as profitable as investors hope.

There is no way that the 40-50 SAAS companies trading at 25-50x sales are ALL the next FAAMG.

You can also achieve similar results with good fundamental companies like google, fb, AMZN, LMT, CVS, MO, etc which all have moved 25%+ in the year based on fundamentals. Heck even the much hates INTC is still up from the 40s when it was labeled a dead company."
6/29/2021 11:28,stocks,[deleted]
6/29/2021 11:40,stocks,"My point isn't so much that you should stay away from growth or any great company. It's that why hold a way overvalued great company when you can hold cheap great companies with less than half the risk?

GOOGL, TGT, ETSY, BODY, MO, T AMZN, INTC are some I am a fan of. If these companies don't grow at all over the next 10 years I still double my money. If they continue at even half their current pace I double in 4 years. If they do great I double I. 2-3. I have no problem buying into NVDA at a great valuation.

NVDA/AMD are priced to perfection and any hiccups could cut their value in half. If any of those others lose half their value they just do stock buybacks or dividends so I can reinvest at firesale prices because they still make a ton of CASH."
6/29/2021 0:00,stocks,"Gold Miners With Potential BASICS

This is a gamble, but I think it has limited downside and significant upside potential. I have taken some small positions to leverage a potential rise in gold prices over the next 6 months.

$GOLD and $KGC are both fundamentally sound, well established companies. In terms of P/E valuation they are both trading at moderate discounts - $GOLD about 25% & $KGC about 40%, compared to industry average. Both of these companies trend with, but do not directly track, the price of gold. The gap in P/E valuation should close, especially if gold prices get back close to $2000/oz.

In addition to the Fed tanking gold prices after their meeting, at about the same time $KGC reported a fire at their Tasiast project mine in Mauritania. They have since provided a mostly positive assessment of the damage, and mining operations have resumed. They did however revise the 2021 projected output for the mine down to 2.1m oz. from 2.4m oz.

Gold took a decent hit after the Fed meeting. Prices dropped from about $1900/oz to about $1750/oz in a week. As a result, share prices for $GOLD & $KGC have taken a hit. Before the Fed meeting $GOLD was trading at the $23-$24+ level. $GOLD closed @ $20.89 on 25 June. $KGC was trading around $8.00 before the Fed meeting and the fire, closed @ $6.38 on 25 June. Here are some price points for comparison.

FUTURE PRICE FACTORS

Predicting the price of gold is tricky, and frankly there are many factors which are beyond my level of understanding. My thinking is this: Inflation is real, significant and not transitory. As the US and other economies continue reopening, and inflation begins to squeeze the budgets of more and more working people, regardless of what the statistics say, it is going to become more commonly reported in the news. The result will be that retail goldbugs will put persistent upward pressure on the price of gold, even if central banks try to mitigate the rise. I also expect commodities in general to recover and rise through the rest of 2021. Gold is a unique commodity, but commodity price increases should apply upward pressure on gold as well. I don’t predict the price to spike to new ATH’s (although it could), but I do expect the price to be back to $1900 level or higher by EOY.

On the downside, I really don’t see gold prices falling significantly from here. For that to happen I think you would need to see a roaring US economy with moderately and steadily rising interest rates, significantly tightening money supply, very moderate inflation, and a profoundly strong dollar. That seems like a black swan from where we are now.

$GOLD and $KGC have floats of 1.8B and 1.3B shares respectively, so they can't be pushed around for very long. While high volume can have an impact on price short-term, because the earnings and values of these companies are so closely tied to the price of gold, longs won't be able to hold the price artificially high, and shorts won't be able to hold the price artificially low for an extended period.

CURRENT POSITIONS:

&#x200B;

* 100 shares $GOLD
* 300 shares $KGC
* 20 x $GOLD 20220122 $25C
* 40 x $KGC 20220122 $10C

$KGC options are a bit more speculative than $GOLD, but both are cheap right now, with low to moderate IV, and decent theta. Both chains have good liquidity.

BOTTOM LINE

If you think the price of gold will be going up through the rest of the year, $GOLD and $KGC are both cheap buys now. If you think the price of gold is going up but aren’t sure it will be before the end of the year, buy shares and skip the options. Owning these companies should provide gains much better than owning actual gold or gold ETF’s. Based on previous price points, if gold rises 6.6% to $1900, I expect $GOLD up conservatively 15% to $24.00, and $KGC about 25% to $8.00. Those are conservative estimates. The Marketbeat analyst consensus PT for $GOLD is $33.25 and for $KGC it is $10.54. Overall, I'm looking for a 2-3 bagger on this play. Will reevaluate at the end of the summer, unless there is a big move before then.

Like I said, my understanding of gold market dynamics is pretty rudimentary. Happy to hear criticism and contrary opinions."

6/29/2021 9:35,stocks,"I am expecting GOLD to reach $35\~$39 by the end of this year. My thesis was similar to yours that gold is a good hedge against inflation it seems to track mostly money supply instead of CPI interestingly enough, so the more the government prints the more is gonna go up."
6/29/2021 0:36,stocks,"Labrador is an OTC which has been pretty volatile this year. I might watch the price action for a possible swing trade, but it isn't really the same category as $GOLD or $KGC which are more secure large cap / mid cap stocks."
6/29/2021 1:43,stocks,"All 3 are South African companies. South Africa adds a measure of instability, compared to Canadian $GOLD & $KGC. $GOLD and $ KGC options also seem to be trading at better prices right now.

I am curious  about the $SBSW chart. Last summer when gold prices were peaking over $2000/oz., SBSW was trading the $13 range. Today it closed at $16.66.  Do you know why that would be? The price action on this stock DOES NOT trend well with the price of gold. 

My objective is to make gains on an gold price rise higher than those available from actual gold or gold ETF's. $SBSW may or may not be a good buy right now - need more information to form an opinion. It does not really fit with my objectives on this trade though."
6/29/2021 4:03,stocks,Yes cannot understand why it is trading low. It's a big platinum producer as well. It's earnings was great and they payed a good dividends. They also have extra cash on hand they where looking to buy more mines.
6/29/2021 0:00,stocks,"Ethical Index Fund Investing (VOTE) Recently, as a dummy laid back investor, I struggled with the idea of supporting major polluters and oil companies by investing in an index fund. In a search for an ""Ethical"" S&P 500 ETF I discovered VOTE. VOTE was created by engine NO. 1 who recently replaced 3 members of Exxon Mobile's board with environmentally concerned individuals. 

What are your thoughts on this? I think this is at least a pretty cool idea and I am considering swapping all my VOO for VOTE.

Now those alone won't be enough unless we have great long-term energy storage, hence nuclear has a place. Oil on the other hand is most certainly less necessary, plastic is getting replaced in many places (see EU) and even US will have to follow eventually.

No auto company is more prepared to take over the EV industry than Tesla. Factories opening up in key areas will improve deliveries. Look at what GM is doing. They found out that Chevy Bolt's are losing too much money so they are changing their EV strategy to higher tier vehicles such as the Cadillac or Hummer where the margins are higher.

I don't know where you are getting Tesla going into space from. Those are two separate companies. But think about this.... Elon Musk is trying to get humans into Mars. Do you really think he would lose the EV race to legacy automakers who sat around and jerked off all this time? GM plans to go full EV by 2035.... Tesla is full EV a decade ago. The point I am trying to make is that Musk and his team are simply way more innovative than these legacy automakers. I trust Tesla more to come out with new and improved products. Cybertruck and Model 2 $25k sedan out by 2023. Name me an EV company coming close to doing that for the same performance at a lower or comparable pricing."

You can pull over and go get gas if you run out.  But if you run out of juice on the highway your stuck.

This year has been a real head scratcher for me as I've finally been getting back into my investment portfolio, moving some things or contributing a bit more when I can. In all reality, keeping my hands off of it for the past 5 or so years was probably the best thing I could have done and I'd like to do that again this year. But with all of the volatility and uncertainty, I'm in a bit of analysis paralysis. 

I picked up some more stable funds in my Roth IRA like VT, VTI, and SCHD/SCHY to form the less volatile base. Now I'm looking to compliment it with some relatively aggressive growth. 

I've had the ARK funds in mind since they had the limelight this year but at the time I was looking, there was a lot of negative sentiment and then they took a tumble. Then I just forgot for a couple of months until now.

At their current pricing and activity, what are your opinions of the ARK funds? I'm mainly thinking Innovation or Autonomous tech but Fintech is tempting and Space could be a big boomer down the road. If I had to choose 2, where should I put my meager funds down? Or should I go elsewhere for aggressive growth? 

I don't plan to look at these for 5 years or so again so I know long term today's price may not matter much but I want some of that emotional satisfaction of going in at a good price early."

6/29/2021 11:57,stocks,"My feelings are different depending upon which of the ARK ETFs we are talking about.

* Let's start with the one that I don't like. ARKX is a joke. It is supposed to be a space-related ETF yet it doesn't hold space companies like Virgin Galactic (Which they sold near the bottom right before it rocketed up; WTF Cathie?). Yet they do hold Netflix because when you think of space, you think Netflix. With most of the holdings in this ETF you have to really stretch to come up with a BS reason as to how it relates to space.

* I like and am invested in ARKG because I'm very bullish on genomics changing the world more than any other field over the next decade but I don't have enough knowledge in this field to pick the individual winners myself. Also, given that most of the companies in this ETF are small-cap, Cathie can influence their price when she adds a holding which then causes many other people to follow and buy-in as well and therefore helps to raise the price on these small-cap genomics stocks after she is already in so it pays to just let Cathie do the buying for me here.

* And for the rest of the ARK ETFs, I generally like them but am not invested in them because I feel that I'm knowledgeable enough to hand-pick the individual stocks that I want in these other areas. So, I just directly invest in companies that I share Cathie's bullishness on such as Tesla, Roku, Pinterest, and DraftKings while avoiding the ones that I disagree with her on such as Coinbase and Twitter."

When spending is this big it leads to wild speculation of which sector will be hurt or benefit the most. stocks will be volatile every time they push for another crazy spending bill that will lead to massive portfolio rebalancing. 

Most precious thing about ark is not their funds, but cathie’s insight about the macro investing environment. She predicted pre Biden growth strategies will take a hit when there isn’t a split Congress due to overdone stimulus leading to surging inflation and tax hike. Recently she thinks those growth stocks will be back because polls show swing states are strongly against tax hike and more big spending bills. Watch her videos and she points out the biggest risks or drivers for investing in growth stocks in the near term. She just never say it out loud that Biden is the biggest factor because retail investors still have a huge Biden fetish.

Picking the sector is basically the same as picking stocks. If you know nothing about the sector, you’re just gambling."
6/28/2021 23:29,stocks,Cathie wood is solid. I’d treat all her funds like a mutual fund (but better than most IMO) and dollar cost average in the funds that best suit your risk appetite

6/29/2021 16:45,stocks,"I never said that I know nothing about the sector. I said that I don't have enough knowledge to pick the individual winners. There is a difference.

I'm very interested in and have read multiple books on genomics to know enough about the sector to understand how life-changing things like CRISPR technology is going to be and to know that I want to have investments in it. But there are multiple companies working on that and they are still young with research that is evolving at a rapid pace so there is no way for me to get enough information about the individual companies to pick which ones will be the most successful without actually being a scientist in the field myself.

But there is not a doubt in my mind that the field as a whole is leading to the biggest revolution of my lifetime and there is a lot of money to be made there. Investing in a genomics ETF protects me against the companies that will fail in their endeavors while allowing me to benefit from the ones that will be successful and change our lives forever."
6/28/2021 23:29,stocks,Too speculative for my taste. And their ETF performance is hard to evaluate objectively because most emerging technology valuations are in bubble territory. It’s yet to be proven that ARK can replicate their success over multiple decades and business cycles.

OnT: Ark isn't Katie's first rodeo, and if we learn by her past results she seldom if ever re-enters a high once the decline has started. She has started (and abandoned) several similar ""disruptive"" ETFs after they took a nosedive, she goes for more risky stocks hoping to reverse the trend but generally fails.



That said if you get in early, and often (follow her projects), you'll come out ahead. ARK has had their highs and I fully expect her to abandon them within 1-2 years to start a new ETF unless she gets a major home run. Whatever she does next is probably a better investment then Ark is at the moment."

Interestingly derivatives were created in the first place to hedge risk, however when they are abused they can get dangerous. The thing missing in your concern is specifics, yes the derivatives market is huge and yes it is potentially dangerous however most derivatives are rather harmless and just ways to speculate to an assets price stuff like a European call option or a commodity futures contract aren't really cause for concern, it's the exotics that can be rather scary, stuff like swaptions, compound options, leveraged inverse floaters, bespoke CDS, synthetic CDOs and such are potentially destabilizing if abbused on a systemic level as we saw in 08, however these are quite rare to see even on an exotics desk and are not a systemic risk as of right now."

About every 10 years."
6/28/2021 23:10,stocks,"Depends on what the underlying derivatives look like. Suppose that a short position was hedged with a long position, and you just kept going. Everything went fine for a while, until someone else pulled out of your long and now you can't maintain your short because your collateral is now crap. And because you leveraged your short so much now you can't pay the margin call without selling off a bunch more stuff. And so on and so forth until the overleveraged positions are unwound. Basically the entire system being an extremely complicated version of one of those impossible chain things that hold itself up under its own tension, except with block-and-tackle pulleys. (The longs I'm referring to are a bunch of safe stuff on the Dow and S&P 100, fyi, implying ""the market"" is insanely mispriced)

IIRC, the nominal value of derivatives during the 08 housing crisis was 3-4Q. In that case the long collateral were housing derivatives that were fundamentally crap, not only because of the actual mortgages inside, but also because of the way the derivatives were recursively layered within each other. It was so bad because it obfuscated just how bad the underlying fundamentals were, and also a nightmare because it was so convoluted it couldn't be easily or quickly unwound. There were some that were never even resolved, some homeowners got a free house because no one could prove they owned the mortgage.

As for the value of derivatives right now, I'm honestly surprised it's so low!"
6/29/2021 0:13,stocks,Not if you're on the right side of them.   Lol
6/28/2021 22:03,stocks,"No, anyone who thinks the derivatives market is anywhere near that large simply doesn't know what they are talking about. Typically this comes from confusing notional values with some economically meaningful measure. But ""notional"" values are essentially made up numbers that exist only to be used in some calculation. They have little relation to market values or to amounts involved in any real world transaction.  

So if you are interested in the actual size of derivatives markets, what you want to know is **market value**. And if you are interested in how much is at risk, what you want to know is **credit exposure**.  

According [to BIS](https://www.bis.org/publ/otc_hy2105.htm), the gross market value of all global OTC derivatives at the end of 2020 was $15.8T, and the gross credit exposure in those markets was $3.4T. In addition to this, the global exchange traded futures and options markets combined had a notional value of ~ $66T (and so market values and exposure some fraction of that). 
  
Basically, due to the way derivatives are actually used, many are most commonly used in hedging, total amounts actually at risk are often much less than market value, after you offset contracts that essentially cancel each other out. So while a reasonable estimate of the total market value for all derivatives is likely less than $50T, the total amount actually at risk of loss globally is likely less than $10T."
6/29/2021 8:05,stocks,"The ""size"" of the derivatives market is misleading. For example, say I sell a $5 credit spread on a $1000 stock. That would lead to $200,000 worth of contracts being created in the market, but my position only has $500 of maximum risk, and the market value of my position could be close to $0.

So all the comparisons of the size of derivatives, relative to things like stock valuations, are really pointless."
6/28/2021 21:19,stocks,Is that the silly notation form like if you sell a 20 strike put of tsla for 0.01 it ‘represents’ $2000 worth of Tesla .  It just seems like a click bait title

The coupon rate is also leveraged compared to the reference rate, so for example for every 10 bp change in the reference rate the coupon rate could move 100. This is a bond that is structured by investment banks and issued by governments and such, but is not to be played with at all, this is probably the most complex instrument that crossed my path so far that is not 100% custom."
6/28/2021 21:48,stocks,"No not really, again the most common derivatives like call options or a futures contract are relatively harmless and won't cause any systematic crash and aren't cause for concern. The exotics are potentially dangerous if abused on a systemic level however as of right now they aren't very common and aren't a big risk to the whole system right now, however they are potentially very dangerous if abused."
6/29/2021 10:58,stocks,"Yes. Margin debt is very high right now, but due to legal changes in the amount allowed it can never be as high as it was before the 1927 crash. Then you could borrow 9X your net account value for 10X leverage. Now you're limited to 2X leverage in a margin account or 4X leverage if you day-trade consistently (actually trade in-and-out every day and have $25k cash and no debt every night).

It's still not a great situation, though, because social media and program trading mean a panic could spread more rapidly and a broad-market flash-crash could wipe out a lot of value. Market circuit breakers would halt trading part-way into that, but there's no guarantee people will calm down before trading resumes."

6/28/2021 22:08,stocks,call on a call
6/29/2021 11:58,stocks,"No I think what's confusing you is that is that the LIF is a type of bond. The bond has a reference rate, for example the US treasury rate or the LIBOR. The coupon rate of a bond normally has a direct relationship to the refrance rate however a LIFs coupon rate is inverse to it's reference rate. So for example if the reference rate is the US fed funds rate, and it goes from 4% to 3% the coupon rate will increase, if rates go up the coupon rate will decrease. It's also leveraged meaning the relationship is more than 1 to 1."
6/28/2021 23:51,stocks,"Yup, I work as a derivatives trader on the sell side."
6/29/2021 8:17,stocks, I do trade derivatives and I know this number probably represents a $1 call on a $20 stock as $2000 when in reality it is $1.
6/29/2021 8:34,stocks,Holy shit you are a fucking weirdo jfc
6/28/2021 22:12,stocks,"how does that work? so like if one call option is exercised the other option can also be exercised, so like is it betting on the outcome of an option with another option."
6/29/2021 13:18,stocks,"Bonds tend to have a negative slope of price to yield, is what I was getting at, so since these are bonds I was applying that to them. The coupon part I understood.

So when regular bond yields are rising, the coupon on the LIF is falling 10X as fast, so do the prices of existing LIFs then drop by 10X? Or does nobody trade them after they buy them?"
6/29/2021 0:31,stocks,Bruh what’s the best LEAP you can sell me right now?
6/29/2021 11:28,stocks,$100

The fuxking audacity!"
6/29/2021 14:08,stocks,"These are floating rate notes so they work differently than fixed rate notes. There is far less price volatility in floating rate notes because the coupon rate floats or changes so the price is less likely to differ from yeild to maturity vs fixed rate where the price can be far more volatile. With this in mind, the inverse floater which has an inverse relationship to its refrance rate also shares the same characteristics as the normal FRN price. People buy these when intrest rates are expected to go lower and sell them when intrest rates are expected to rise. The market price moves in tandem with the coupon rate so when intrest rates rise the yield and market price fall but the ratio isn't 1-1 since the market price of a standard FRN is less volatile than a fixed rate notes market price. So you basically got it but the thing your missing is that the refrance rate is never another bonds yeild and instead a benchmark rate ex LIBOR or Fed funds rate etc."
6/29/2021 0:40,stocks,"I won't sell you one because I work in the fixed income space, but I can point you in the right direction, use something called the black scholes model, basically what it does is it determines the theoretical fair price for an options contract, what you want is to buy an option that is priced under the calculated value for the best risk/reward. Now you do need something mathematical knowledge to use this but there are some good resources on YouTube and Google that teach you how to use it. Also note the black scholes model is only suitable for European style options as it assumes you won't exercise until expiry, usually black scholes is fine for American options as there isn't need to exercise early, but just note it is more sutable for European style options."
6/29/2021 11:30,stocks,"I mean $1 as in a far OTM call priced at 1¢, which is actually $1."
6/29/2021 9:00,stocks,"Yes, which is why I said I trade derivatives."
6/28/2021 22:19,stocks,"No that's not how they work, basically it's an option where the underlying asset is another option. Basically you have two strike prices, if the first one gies above the strike price and is exercised you get another option and that option if exercised gives you the stock. This isn't really useful in the stock market but Is far more useful in fixed income spaces to hedge intrest rate risk."
6/29/2021 15:10,stocks,"Okay. I'm getting it.  LIBOR and FFR are interbank rates, not bonds. And price•yield = fixed coupon is the reason ordinary bonds have inverse price and yield variation, but the coupon on an LIF isn't fixed so the price just follows the coupon up or down.

So are LIFs used as a hedge for non-inverse floaters, or are they used more to hedge interest-rate swaps?"
6/29/2021 11:39,stocks,That's a .01 call.
6/29/2021 10:14,stocks,Trading options doesn't mean shit man. Anybody can trade options nowadays.
6/29/2021 11:35,stocks,Trade VIX ~~options~~ ~~futures~~ options.
6/29/2021 15:35,stocks,"Yes that's basically the whole idea. They are mainly used as a hedge for the falling refrance rate of the bond. People use this to hedge falling intrest rates or to speculate on whatever the refrance rate of the bond is, they can also use it to hedge intrest rate swaps, but these are very complex and the client can get absolutely hammered I'd rates spike just a little, these are also incredibly hard to structure. This is the most complex product I saw, but someone who used to work in london talked about a LOBO loan which is only in the UK and is the most complex product in my opinion, so if you wnat to learn more about really complex derivatives go there."
6/29/2021 11:40,stocks,Yes that's what I just said. A 1¢ call has a $1 value.
6/29/2021 11:17,stocks,"Whats your fucking point asshole, I never said it made me special

Or did you just get yourself into an adversarial headspace and are too fucking thickheaded and dumb to extricate yourself?"
6/29/2021 16:22,stocks,"(small cloud of dust...)

Edit...oh, I get it. It's a kind of variable-rate bond that lets the borrower pay off early if they don't like the new rate set by the lender.

That's not too complicated. The 40-70 year term is a red flag though. Humans really don't have a good sense of the massive effects of compound interest over long intervals.

And anyone getting into a variable-rate loan should be thinking from the beginning of how they'll refinance at the first uptick in the interest rate."
6/29/2021 11:49,stocks,It's not what you said. You said a $1 call on a $20 stock. That'd cost you $100.

How would raising dividends to ""lure investors in"" help the banks? How do banks benefit from that in any way? And why would they do that? A ""rug pull"" doesn't do anything for the bank aside from destroy their credibility. 

> t has nothing to do with the pandemic

The feds upped the amount that the banks had to keep in reserves during the pandemic. They removed much of that now. So yes it absolutely has a lot to do with the pandemic. Banks have had tons of cash lying around doing nothing. They want to up their dividend to get redistribute their cash."

6/29/2021 16:01,stocks,"JP Morgan (JPM)  
  
During the years prior to the 2008 crisis, JP Morgan (JPM ) offered a dividend yield around 3%. By 2008, as JPM’s share price began to crumble, its yield rose above 4%. By February of 2009, JPM’s yield dropped to just 0.55% when the company cut its dividend for the first time since 1990 from 38 cents to 5 cents per share quarterly. This drastic change came as a surprise to many investors. Although many banks had recently slashed dividends, JPM was still considered one of the most stable investment banks, and was one of the last to cut its payout.  
  
This dividend reduction came soon after the company received $25 billion in TARP bailout funds. JPM’s CEO Jamie Dimon reported that the cut was unrelated to the bailout, and said that this cut was made to allow JPM to have more financial flexibility. The 87% dividend cut helped the bank save $5 billion annually, which freed up capital to repay bailout funds.  
  
Wells Fargo (WFC)  
  
San Francisco-based Wells Fargo (WFC ) kept up with its peers by offering over a 3% dividend yield in 2006 and 2007. In 2008, WFC’s yield shot up to 4.5% as its share price fell, similar to other banks at the time.  
  
Just two months after the bank’s purchase of ailing Wachovia in March 2009, the bank cut its dividend 85% from 34 cents to just 5 cents per share, leaving shareholders with a mere 0.70% yield. The cut allowed WFC to save $5 billion a year to help fund its toxic mortgage losses.  
  
Bank of America (BAC)  
  
Charlotte, NC-based Bank of America (BAC ) traded at around $50 prior to the 2008 crisis, and had a dividend yield that exceeded 5% in 2007 and reached 7% by 2008. The banking giant was historically a great choice for dividend investors, but that all changed in 2009 when the bank was forced to cut its dividend in order to comply with government restrictions after taking TARP bailout funds.  
  
In 2009, BAC cut its quarterly dividend to just 1 cent per share. This left investors with just a 0.23% dividend yield. Since the dividend cut, BAC has made attempts to raise its dividend, but has failed to gain government approval.  
  
Citigroup ©  
  
In 2006, Citigroup (C ) had a dividend yield of about 4% which increased to over 4.5% in 2007. By 2008, the New York City-based bank had a dividend yield of over 7% as its stock price began to fall. In 2008, Citi was bailed out by the U.S. government for the first time and given $25 billion in TARP bailout funds. By February 2009, Citi had received its third government bailout. The government owned one-third of its shares.  
  
To comply with the government regulations, the bank suspended its dividend entirely from 2009-2010. In March 2011, the company resumed its dividend, offering a yield of just 0.10%, or 1 cent per share. During this time, C also did a reverse stock split of 10 to 1, making its shares worth approximately $44.

Support is good and responds fast. Card works online and offline in America or Asia except at places (Micosoft, Facebook, Digital Ocean) which reject prepaid cards. You can still pipe it through paypal for those places.

This is what I like about it:
Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing. “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.”

Partnered with Coinbase, Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, and Pointsbet among many others.

Voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method”

Paysafe has the #2 digital wallet globally with a presence in 120 countries. They own Skrill, which is enabled for crypto-to-crypto trading (Bitcoin & 26 other crypto-currencies) and was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.”

In Europe, where Paysafe is more known, Trustpilot rates Paysafe as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) with over 29,000 reviews, and Skrill as “great” (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews. They are currently laying the groundwork for their US expansion.

Unlike any other payment processor, Paysafecard enables those without bank accounts or credit cards (the over 1.7 billion “unbanked”) to engage in online commerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.

Paysafe’s industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are slow to enter. CEO Philip McHugh: “When we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.”

In Q1 Paysafe had $90 million in one-time expenses associated with merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. This means without those expenses they would have beat analysts estimates and, going forward, they are well positioned to beat analysts EPS estimates for the rest of the year.

Recent debt management, saving around $92 million annually, secures higher margins and higher profits which will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.

Paysafe confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 growth projection which doesn’t include planned inorganic M&A growth pipeline and iGaming expansion (55% CAGR).

From 2017 to 2019, under Blackstone/CVC stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion. (28% CAGR) 2020 saw revenue stagnate due to Covid-related business closures and high-risk channel exits but, even so, if you add 2020’s performance, 2017-2020 still amounts to a respectable 18% CAGR, roughly the same as PayPal’s current projected growth.

Buy rating from all seven analysts covering Paysafe, with 50-70% upside from current price but, with everything noted above, it’s clear that Paysafe would still be significantly undervalued when compared to a basket of comps (PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign) with a collective growth rate of ~12.5% (in Paysafe’s 10-13% range):

​

Paysafe's price based on sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

​

Valuation Notes:

Removed all high outliers in each category putting PSFE at $100+
Unlike Paysafe's reported $362 million in free cash flow (on track to increase 29%) and 30%+ EBITDA margin, half of peers report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.
Paysafe has better EPS than over half of the peer group
Paysafe has better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them
​

Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, Bill Foley, has a proven track record in generating value for his investors through rapid synergistic inorganic growth. This is a key strategic pillar for Paysafe. Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). He says, “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.”"
6/29/2021 2:01,stocks,"Hardly. Peer valuation metrics with current cash flow, debt, EPS, and revenue put PaySafe 3x from here even with current growth projections which don’t take into account the expanding US iGaming market."
6/29/2021 1:41,stocks,"Common misconception. Actually pre-Covid Paysafe was growing faster than PayPal and if you include last year’s revenue which was severely disrupted by Covid-related brick and mortar business and sporting event closures, their CAGR over the last three years was 18%, which is equal to PayPal’s projected growth."
6/28/2021 23:50,stocks,Gonna run away from this one
6/29/2021 6:56,stocks,"Paysafe is big in esports, sports betting and twitch. They have created a niche for themselves in these areas. If you think they have a future, then paysafe does too. I agree with not doing 47b, doesn't mean it's not worth getting into. It has an average fair estimate around 18$s, which is probably worth something"
6/29/2021 1:34,stocks,Actually their margins and profit are decent.  The bear case is worries about growth.
6/29/2021 1:06,stocks,You might want to dig deeper. The only reason they weren’t profitable this last quarter was due to $90 million in one time expenses.
6/28/2021 20:37,stocks,"That’s a lot better.

To be honest, the case with most SPACs is that they are selling “castles in the sky” based on rosy projections. Case in point, most of the things you like about the stock are based on speculation and projections.

PaySafe might be different, but it’s still sus to me that they didn’t IPO the normal way. On top of that I don’t want to be someone who profits off gambling."
6/29/2021 8:41,stocks,No you’re trying to pump your bags
6/28/2021 22:11,stocks,This is not aligned with the company's expectation. IIRC they expect to grow 15% annually.

6/28/2021 20:40,stocks,"Understandable. Yea SPACs can be weird. I got hit with Hylion. I was up like 300% and held too long. Still made money, but lost out on a lot by holding too long."
6/28/2021 20:53,stocks,Good to be suspicious of SPACs because most are truly trash. PSFE is very different in that it already generates $362 million in free cash flow and recently reported that their on track to increase that by 29%. The SPAC route enabled them to do a deal with M&A master Bill Foley while paying down $1.2 billion in debt and avoiding much bigger IPO fees. There’s a lot more to it of course. GL.

However, I bought in for the long term and also bought some more in the event it memes. A $9B market cap is getting to be a bit high for meme stocks, as our neighbors over at that other subreddit more than likely aren't going to be finding $9-18 billion in the couch cushions to push it up 100-200%.

6/29/2021 4:07,stocks,"Cool. It's definitely more complex than just Covid, although it did hit them very hard.  Another key and perhaps larger aspect of slow revenue growth in 2020 is they exited high-risk Chinese and Southeast Asian markets. This was part of a planned restructuring they are currently undergoing to de-risk and be more profitable going forward.  In a recent ER transcript, they said that if they had not exited those revenue channels they would have reported Q1 YoY growth in the ""mid to high teens""."

Their offering of more shares simply reduces the investor's proportional ownership in the company. They are selling off more shares to raise capital, probably for a new project or to complete an existing one. The shares sold will be included in the public market cap, so +400M.

It's a risk you decide that you'll want to take to further invest in the company, since it's not specified why they are raising the capital. I do like the company, but missed out on this 50% jump. In the genomic field, I like ARKG."

I realize ARK G/genomics are the future, but at the same time, I want to be able to deploy my money tactically, like in the mid-term, if that makes sense. I don't want to end up holding the bag with growth ETFs that will take 6+ months to recover if there is a collapse."

Or, they could continue to be valued highly and low interest rates keep their business attractive and flush with very cheap funding, enabling them to make the major inroads they seek

6/28/2021 22:03,stocks,I agree. Their delivery app is among the best I've seen and same store integrated.
6/29/2021 6:53,stocks,I agree with Walmart is looking good for the future. People are underestimating it. I’ve loaded up on it as well.
6/28/2021 21:23,stocks,"Nice, I would buy some shares but I have ethical issues with pretty much everything Saudi Arabia does lol."
6/29/2021 12:58,stocks,These insanely low-profit margins are why Amazon is pushing to force the 15$ an hour wage onto Walmart. If this happens then Walmart will have to change how it prices its goods and will give Amazon another advantage.
6/29/2021 17:40,stocks,"It was a long time ago, so I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't as bad now. However, I will mention that I was going for a higher-end consumer laptop, not just a basic one, so the comparable apple product was macbook pro. It was waayyyy more expensive despite having a smaller screen and less powerful components."
6/29/2021 2:47,stocks,This might actually be the dumbest lie I’ve come across on Reddit.
6/28/2021 21:27,stocks,It’s kind of like when I misplace things. The item is always in the last place I look.
6/29/2021 17:39,stocks,"But what would happen if Walmart used each of their stores as warehouses to hold items used for <1 hour delivery.  Delivery in less than an hour is the next stage in home delivery and Walmart is perfectly positioned to not just compete but dominate in the US.  

Also, Amazon bought Whole Foods and has been looking at opening up Amazon brick and mortar stores so I don’t think having so many physical locations is that much of a drawback."
6/29/2021 17:53,stocks,M1 was a game changer in that that regard.  All models from the desktop to even the iPad have the same SOC.  I just wish it ran Windows with x86-64 support similar to how Apple implemented Rosetta 2
6/29/2021 9:12,stocks,"Counterpoint, he might not be lying he might just be incredibly gullible."
6/29/2021 11:55,stocks,It’s fact baby. All the stuff at apple stores on the racks can easily be unpackaged and snagged. They obviously never stole computers or iPhones.
6/29/2021 12:27,stocks,"iPods aren't kept on the racks afaik.

But even if they are, the iPod mini came out in 2004 and Beats was acquired by Apple in 2014. So you're saying your friend was in high school for \~10 years and was stealing Apple merch on a weekly basis?"
6/28/2021 20:34,stocks,Why does she keep telling you tho?
6/29/2021 12:54,stocks,It was one of the tiny iPods bro. I didn’t go back and look up the exact model I just know it was a tiny iPod without the touchscreen. iPod nano or shuffle perhaps? This was during 2011-2012 time period. They still sold beats in the apple stores at that time prior to the acquisition. Idk why you’re working so hard to disprove this. I literally saw the fruits of this labor multiple time.
6/29/2021 0:00,stocks,"Institutional Ownership What is the possible outcome of an institutional ownership going from 98% to 98% down to 0% - Is the company being bought out or going bankrupt?

6/28/2021 20:07,stocks,The 0% number is a mistake. I see 96.28 today. They are a very financially secure company. https://wallmine.com/nyse/jeld
6/28/2021 21:29,stocks,"Financial institutions can’t just sell that amount of equity on the open market like that. They’d have to file it with the SEC and would likely be sued by the company. 

I’ve noticed that there are a lot of buzzwords people come across on Stocktwits that are almost meaningless, (dark pool trading, manipulation, volume, institutional ownership) 

Don’t over think it. Most publicly traded companies have a high % of shares owned by financial institutions."

Cathie has been a very outspoken supporter of BTC and has been buying it through GBTC as she has not been able to hold it for tax purposes. I'm personally very interested to see how this etf is structured and what it's composed of.

However, after the very disappointing reveal of ARKX, I'm a little concerned that ARK is just churning out etfs to reap management fees but hopefully this etf proves me wrong."

6/28/2021 20:40,stocks,Hopefully they don't stick an ETF inside of an ETF again.
6/28/2021 20:12,stocks,"""Wood has said she sees a future where bitcoin is part of a balanced investment portfolio. Ark Invest estimates that if 1% of the corporate cash of every company in the S&P 500 were converted into bitcoin, then the asset’s price would balloon by more than $40,000 from its current levels. If the cash level increased to 10% from each company in the broader stock index, bitcoin’s price would increase by more than $400,000, the firm said.""

Imagine the price of bitcoin if we all just dump all our money into bitcoin /s"
6/28/2021 21:39,stocks,So what is a Bitcoin ETF?  A fund containing only Bitcoin and companies involved with Bitcoin?  What would those be?  Graphics card manufacturers?  Companies with substantial Bitcoin holdings like Microstrategy?
6/29/2021 0:51,stocks,"Actual question here:

Since ETFs are pretty much portfolios meant to track a certain group of stocks and spread out the risk. Why would you create an ETF that tracks one ticker?"
6/28/2021 22:17,stocks,Run away.
6/28/2021 20:09,stocks,lmao will probably hold John Deere and Netflix
6/28/2021 22:36,stocks,I love watching her videos from 2017 talking about Cryptocurrency!
6/28/2021 21:56,stocks,"Or you could just you know, buy actual Bitcoin."
6/28/2021 20:51,stocks,People commenting about ARKX ‘not doing anything’ while they explicitly say these are 5+ year outlooks
6/28/2021 20:11,stocks,Well when the good Lord tells you to make a Bitcoin ETF…
6/28/2021 20:21,stocks,Arkx has no space companies not even vacq probably the most qualified to be on there

6/28/2021 23:48,stocks,"I'm generally a fan of Cathie, but the ARKX ETF was a joke so now I'm skeptical of any new ETF. After what we saw with the holdings of ARKX, this new ETF might not have any Bitcoin yet have Netflix for some reason."

I still feel like bitcoin is going to pop and crash big time at some point. And every single crypto is so linked to it that they all will follow."
6/29/2021 2:08,stocks,Guaranteed to have Tesla in there.
6/29/2021 3:03,stocks,"I bought 50 shares of ARKX when it came out just for fun, knew its holdings were less speculative than other ARK funds. Wanted to hold it long term but only made it like 3 months before selling for a higher conviction.

Anyway 5-6% in that time frame isn't bad. ARK funds are worth it.

If I had to guess what this will hold...tesla, marathon, riot, nvidia, square, Sofi, Coinbase, microstrategy make sense. Br.qs or mo.go would be exciting."
6/29/2021 4:13,stocks,* Buys $TDOC and $SQ
6/29/2021 4:55,stocks,Excited for this

6/28/2021 20:08,stocks,Lol I just unloaded all the ark crap I’ve been bag holding. Be gone and good riddens you under performing waste of capital

6/29/2021 14:09,stocks,Fuck Cathie woods
6/28/2021 23:15,stocks,Top holding = John Deere
6/28/2021 20:24,stocks,Ark have the biggest holding in grayscale gbtc. Isnt conflict of interest here starting her own…….. she is going to beat grayscale to come with the etf first. First mover advantage ????

6/29/2021 0:37,stocks,Did it state which other ARK ETFs this one would own?
6/29/2021 1:14,stocks,Same impression here. Better to pick stocks and cryptos yourself. Not a financial advice.
6/29/2021 1:17,stocks,"Oh wow, so now if crypto crashes  your etf plummets in its entirety. Sigh...."
6/29/2021 2:16,stocks,Doesn’t BLOK accomplish this?
6/29/2021 2:24,stocks,Cathie missed out on SPCE and sold over a month ago. Crazy for a SPACE ETF
6/29/2021 3:06,stocks,Well what else is a Bitcoin etf supposed to do besides collect fees? You can literally buy bitcoin and the only reason for any Bitcoin etf is free money.
6/29/2021 3:19,stocks,Oh God. Now I'm scared to check my grayscale btc position....
6/29/2021 3:41,stocks,So GBTC ?
6/29/2021 3:50,stocks,Well she is not the first. every single application for crypto ETFs has been rejected. Not sure why hers would get through. Unless she is going OTC like GBTC
6/29/2021 5:30,stocks,"My impression of ARK is that each of their funds is close to being an index fund, with each in a red hot sector. 

Hot sectors make bad long term investments because they attract 100s or 1,000s of competitors. Of those 1,000s of companies only a few will do well, most will go bust through competition. 

ARK does not seem to focus on a handful of the best of the best in each sector, but has 40 or 50 companies. 

Even focusing on a few in a hot sector seems to be a bad strategy because there are 1,000s of companies try to outcompete them. 

So it seems to me that ARK are total hype funds which in 5 years time won’t have beaten the S&P. 

What do you think? Just my amateur observation."
6/29/2021 7:39,stocks,"A better bitcoin ETF, if that segment interests you, is getting bitcoin yourself."

6/29/2021 8:29,stocks,I don't know how anyone with a little sense left in their skull can trust her with their finances. A little background check would be enough. She's an absolute moron who coincidentally made a ton of money in one year. Her portfolio is literally full of overvalued garbage it's absolutely insane.
6/29/2021 8:42,stocks,Buy John Deere on the expected accumulation.

6/29/2021 10:14,stocks,What a stupid idea 😂
6/29/2021 10:21,stocks,considering how shit GBTC has been and probably will be for a while. They need to take matters into their own hands.

6/29/2021 11:55,stocks,Second layer solutions allow greater per-second transactions. Also what will likely happen is the bitcoin fees will be high due to low TPS and only whale money will move on BTC; regular transactions will occur on a scalable system like ethereum or other blockchain which handles greater throughput.

You can build on top of the network. Look up lightning network and nodes.

Normally you need days to do a cross border large transfer.

https://youtu.be/7bOo3zLFhEk

Not to mention the reserve arent going to be going through a lot of transaction, having cash is the least efficient use of capital, hence why some diversity reserves in bitcoin, precious metal and bonds

Countries that have weak fiat will adopt crypto and prove that it works, decentralized finance works and it would spread from there.

6/29/2021 8:50,stocks,"Except it kind of is, if one is being practical.  

Take MasterCard and Visa.  They have what you and I would probably call average security.  If they wanted, it they could crank that security up.  Way way up.  But with their current mild security, they can do hundreds of millions of transactions per second, cheaply, reliably, and with losses that are small enough not to really affect their generous bottom line.  And a lot of of their losses arising from soft security they can pass off to other parties.  

So why would MasterCard and Visa make their product work much crappier, slash their capacity, jack up their expenses, reduce their profits, burn more electricity, and piss off more customers... just so they can say ""our security is better!""  There's little pragmatic benefit.

And another point of realism... even with their pretty pedestrian security, nothing stops them from marketing statements claiming they have amazing security, even if they don't.  It costs nothing to brag."

She discussed getting in on private companies in the context of the ARKX fund specifically and was related to SpaceX/Starlink. She will absolutely get in on both (supposing starlink spins off) as soon as is pragmatic. I dont recall any update on her potential private investments yet though I don't follow every article and podcast that she does. I think there are some heavy fees and lack of ability to buy/sell SpaceX so I dont know when/if she planned on trying to acquire some prior to any future IPO but she certainly talked about the desire to make it happen. 

Additionally, Cathie bumped up max % of any single company to 30% (from 10%) in her ETFs.  


There is a Barron's fund that has \~10% SpaceX now and like 50% Tesla and the rest mostly ICLN or whatever the green fund is."
6/28/2021 20:05,stocks,Not any time soon. Some funds have SpaceX funds in them now. Someday (likely after Mars mission) they will almost certainly IPO. Elon has stated his desire to maintain controlling interest though. Starlink may get spun off earlier.. with Elon commenting several times that once it is stable profitability for a couple years they would IPO that.  The context is that Cathie Wood expressed interest in using ARKX to invest in private space companies.. aka SpaceX/Starlink. Also Elon has expressed a willingness to let long time Tesla holders in on those IPOs and Cathie's funds have tens of millions of long time Tesla shares. So she is in a practical place for both desire to acquire and likelihood to get a good chance for both SpaceX and Starlink (should they be offered separately).

Apple are design royalty. The software world and much of the hardware world follow and outright copy whatever they do (iPhone 4, iPad, Airpods, Apple Watch, MacBook M1)

To say Apple just use existing tech has to be coming from a point of tech ignorance. 

Apple has pioneered so much innovation in the tech space that its borderline unparalelled: Mac GUI (what Windows was based on), smartphone GUI (every smartphone has used since), WebKit (browser engine, Chrome was a fork of this), AR/VR Kit (best in the industry), Secure enclave (pioneered in iPhone 5), voice assistant Siri (first in a phone, and recently first to be executed entirely locally), A series chip design, M1 chip design, encrypted network of global devices via FindMy, and just recently Apple are deploying a global layered routing service similar to Tor for any iCloud user to access, a step above any VPN on web privacy. 

And things are just getting started: the M1 line is already industry leading in its first iteration, AR/VR is going fundamentally change how humans interact with computers, Apple have a self driving car, and there's rumblings of a search engine as well."

6/29/2021 10:08,stocks,"Yeah, for practical reasons speed is without a doubt important, but it never was one of Bitcoin's objectives, or at least not to the point of sacrificing decentralization for it anyway. Other cryptocurrencies or layer 2 solutions can do thousands or millions of transactions per second, but always sacrificing decentralization. 

You can also argue that being useful or not might be irrelevant to Bitcoin's worth as long as enough people agree on the given value. Certainly the past few years seem to support this, as unnerving as it might be for a good number of investors.

For what it's worth and IMO, you won't need complete decentralization and trustless, public transactions for your everyday, Visa/Mcard kind of stuff. But there's definitely use cases for it."

Right now you can get in on Barron's BFGFX and BPTRX. (Looks like they are down to roughly 5% in each portfolio as they must not have bought more as those portfolios grew in assets under management.) Those funds hold different classes of SpaceX stocks, so you would need to research which youd want.

I don't know of anything higher % than barron's though I havent dug around. The barron's fund had like 2.75% management fees to go along with those higher cost private transactions so it turned me off a bit. Also the weighting of Tesla is 41% in the TRX and 31% in the GFX) along with slightly different distribution of the other companies. I opted for pure Tesla play with ARK\_ funds instead. I will likely roll the dice with ARKX and hope they buy SpaceX/Starlink at pre-IPO prices but I have not bought any ARKX yet myself. I am long on the others as my disclaimer."

By the time legacy brokerages are trading a few cryptos Coinbase could be wrapping defi protocols seamlessly into their UI, half of which their venture arm vetted and seeded, with the best insurance offerings because of their understanding and history, and probably doing the back end custody and liquidity for those banks, etc. Their institutional support people will be way more knowledgeable, and have access to 100x deeper liquidity.

They will grow, don't get me wrong, but what really surprised me learning about space companies is the small satellite launchers that are already successful, and the number that have great projects in the pipeline that no one has heard of, with awesome ideas for re usability, practicality, and efficient manufacturing. For a long hold ETF, it's not a terrible move.

SPCE uses a plane launch platform currently, which is very limited on payload capacity and orbit trajectories. Yes this can be developed further, and they can eventually move to ground launches, but they don't have this tech and are not actively testing that tech while other companies are. They make the news because people like hearing about millionaires going into space, but small companies are making moves to have a mobile small sat launchers, and fully 3D printed engines which can be built in a day (early development here, but promising). Companies like that, have far greater potential in the coming decades as they can actually reach low earth orbit now, or are laying better foundational work to be able to so with larger payloads."
6/28/2021 21:40,stocks,"Yes, her interview on the Christian podcast *Jesus Calling* ([audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whg-wuVwOsA), [transcript](https://www.jesuscalling.com/podcast/surviving-and-thriving-to-help-gods-children-victoria-damone-catherine-wood/)):

> Well, I started ARK Invest at the age of fifty-seven, so it was quite late in my career. I believe my career is starting all over again, though. I decided to name my company after the Ark of the Covenant, because as I was going through that very difficult period starting in ‘06, where the market, nothing made sense to me, I started reading the One-Year Bible, after I would read the passage for the day, I would then just open it up randomly and say, “God, speak to me. Just show me what to do. Show me Your will. Show me Your way.” 

> And not every time I did that, but I would say every third or fourth time, I would run into the Ark of the Covenant being taken into the Israelites, taking the Ark of the Covenant into battle before them, because they believed that the presence of God was in the Ark of the Covenant. As I began to get this idea of a firm going and realized that I was fighting this war, I knew I had to name my company “ARK” for Ark of the Covenant. 

> I founded the company out of faith. I got this calling one day when I walked into my home. It was a beautiful summer day. I walked in to complete silence, which was very unusual in my household at that time. The children were all gone to Christian camps and other activities. And so I was all alone for the first time ever in my house, all alone for two full weeks. And I walked over to the kitchen island and I wasn’t happy and I wasn’t sad. I was just, Wow, this has never happened to me before.

> As soon as I said that to myself, I felt a wham and I really feel like that was the Holy Spirit just saying to me, “Okay, this is the plan.” And the idea was basically, “Look, you’ve been a student of disruptive innovation your entire career. Why don’t you disrupt your own industry? It’s broken. Why do you disrupt it with some of these new technologies? Why don’t you harness social media? Why don’t you invite people in—even your competitors—to brainstorm about these new ideas, to help spread the word?” And so I did that, and it’s been amazing. It’s so much better than anything that I could have possibly imagined. 

> I funded it for the first three years all by myself. And for the first three years, our assets didn’t grow that much. And I thought, Oh my goodness, what have I done? Every two weeks there was an exit of a significant amount of my wealth into the company. And I would kneel down and say, “Okay, God, You’re in control. Even if this company fails, I know I’ve done the right thing. This is a walk of faith for me. Your will be done.” 

> What we were really doing was encouraging the new creation, God’s new creation. We were allocating capital to its highest and best use: transformative technologies that were going to change the world and make it a better place, while the rest of the world started investing in the past, which they thought was safe. Today, the tables are flipped, so we feel like we’ve done the right thing. It is by God’s grace and the power of the Holy Spirit, I will tell you, that I moved in this direction.

> God’s standard of success for me in the financial world, and in my life generally, is following His will. And I believe that in starting ARK Invest, I was fulfilling His will for me here on Earth and that if I had not done it, that I would have died an unhappy woman not having not fulfilled my promise here. And so it’s not so much about me and my promise. It’s about allocating capital to God’s creation in the most innovative and creative way possible"

6/28/2021 21:13,stocks,"Yeah it’s been tough being an Arsenal fan. I bought the top of Arsenal so to speak, started following closely right after that cl loss in 06 and it’s been all down hill from there. I’m buying the dip with Saka tho, he has me as excited as Cesc did back in the day."
6/28/2021 21:10,stocks,I know it was a bit of a joke. Tbf memes are powerful these days and Tesla will lose its luster once all these other evs are ubiquitous.

6/29/2021 10:20,stocks,"Fair enough. I own some LMND and Lemonade's real advantage (not the AI bullshit they market) is the fact that the insurance space is a regulatory nightmare with completely different laws in each state, which prevents competitors from entering the space. So instead of Lemonade having competitors popping up left and right (e.g. Robinhood, Webull, SoFi, etc in the broking space) they mostly just have to outmaneuver clunky, bureaucratic, traditional insurance companies that do 99% of everything either in Excel or on a Mainframe. Not the worst moat to have, and maybe I should reconsider my thoughts on COIN."

6/28/2021 22:10,stocks,I feel like nowhere there says she lets god choose her individual stocks. She's obviously very devout but so are plenty of people in investing. She clearly says god is guiding her to investing in innovative technologies that will change the world. I don't believe in God but I have no problem investing in her funds.

6/28/2021 21:16,stocks,"I'm dumb, I thought you were replying to my other comment. Still, just look at the fucking graph lmao. ARKK has SP500 easily. Even if you count individual years, SP500 gets beaten almost every time."
6/29/2021 11:56,stocks,"Space exploration and innovation will probably improve lives in that way for the whole world and all kinds of companies (in your example, anyone who has anything to do with the internet). So why not simply include all of them? Just make it a broad market ETF that has every company because 'surely they'll benefit from it anyway'?  

The point is that this is for companies that are actually doing the exploring and innovating. That's what the prospectus says: companies *engaged* in space exploration and innovation. And therefore just ramming in random technology companies and hype themes makes no sense."
6/28/2021 22:44,stocks,"> She clearly says god is guiding her to investing in innovative technologies that will change the world. 

Yes, exactly.  Good luck with your investment."
6/28/2021 21:53,stocks,I also would not buy into your ETF.
6/29/2021 10:25,stocks,"Nobody’s pissed or defensive. Are you really so sensitive you can’t handle the truth. 

And stop trying to walk it back. You said it was due to Tesla, now it’s mostly do to Tesla. Like you’re so focused on Tesla driving the underlying, you discredit the dozens of other over-performing stocks, and don’t even acknowledge the etfs that have done great without any Tesla. 

It’s almost as if arkks success isn’t riding on Tesla. Numbers don’t lie. Just even looking at it simply, Tesla is only up around 250% the past year, and arkk around 90%. And it’s only been 10% of the weight at most on it’s best and worst days. 

I don’t really care what everyone thinks. Most people are idiots either way. This is directed towards your untruthful statements. It has nothing to do with bulls or bears or whatever you want to try walking back too."
6/29/2021 14:23,stocks,"Okay you can't provide information to back up your bullshit bc it doesn't exist.

Or are you just taking a trip down memory lane and conveniently ignoring the fundamental changes to the market landscape and the ongoing (very open) exposure she has to the vulnerabilities of running a hack nonsensical Ponzi scheme fund that depends entirely on customer inflows (not investments) for continued solvency?

Are you going back to 2019 to invest or is now relevant?"
6/29/2021 14:47,stocks,Dude. No one cares about you. You’re just overstimulated and young. Take a walk or something. Deep breath even. You’re not doing your blood pressure any good.

* \[MOAT\] owns 40 to 50 stocks with wide  moats and that are trading at a discount to fair value, usually in the  15% to 25% discount range. When moat ratings change or the discount to  fair value becomes comparatively noncompetitive with others, the  position is replaced. Not only do the components change based on moat  rating and discount to fair value, but the portfolio is re-balanced to  an equal weighting as well. This creates a relatively high annual  portfolio turnover of around 25%.
* The ETF, managed by VanEck, is based on the *Morningstar® Wide Moat Focus Index*, which includes only U.S. stocks and, as the name suggests, only companies that possess wide economic moats.

6/29/2021 0:00,stocks,"$POWW potential run up It is known that America’s economy runs on 3 things: McDonald’s, freedom, and guns. There are not many things that Americans enjoy more than these 3 items; however, some say ammo is a close contender. We are currently experiencing an ammo shortage like no other. [People are currently scalping ammo and selling it for 3-4X MARK UP.](https://outsider.com/outdoors/viral/ammo-shortage-scalpers-buying-ammunition-profit-resale-making-issue-worse/) This is insane and we have not had a shortage of ammo like this before. 

If we take a look at the charts of one of the largest gun manufacturers and ammunition providers in the US, Smith & Wesson ($SWBI), you can see their stock price has rose over 60% in the last 10 trading days. This is due to them blowing their earnings expectations out of the water and a share buyback announcement. In the conference call with the higher ups of $SWBI, the CEO himself states the shortage may continue to worsen and he does not believe it will get better anytime soon. 

Now here comes the good stuff: Ammo inc., also known as $POWW. This is a relatively new company that was listed on the NASDAQ on December 2020. They have some of the best financials you can hope for. Here is a link to their [investor presentation in April.]( https://ammoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AMMO-Inc.-Investor-Presentation-April-2021.pdf) Going back to the fiscal year of 2018, they are experiencing and projecting a 160.6% CAGR which is amazing. Their guidance for their net sales in 2021 was reported as $58M; however, they have now increased their guidance to $62.2M. For a company to increase their guidance by so much in such a short amount of time, you know good things are cooking. Due to this being the end of fiscal year of 2021 for this company, the addition to their guidance will be portrayed in their next earnings report, which comes out TOMORROW. I am banking on the fact that they will blowout their earnings just like Smith & Wesson. Their net sales, gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA are increasing tremendously year over year. They recently acquired a US department of defense contract to manufacture multi-purpose rounds. The company is becoming more and more financially efficient while also being in an extremely high demand area. 

If the earnings are not spectacular tomorrow, then this will still be a good long term hold due to &POWW’s exciting future. They are building a new production facility in Wisconsin that will increase their production capacity by over 100%. This facility will be finished and in production in early 2022. Just the fact that ammo is in such high demand and experts believe it will not get better anytime soon, I feel good about this play."

6/29/2021 0:50,stocks,"This is why people are saying this is an earnings play.

They are about to release totally new numbers tomorrow.  You are looking at numbers that don't take into account that they now own [gunbroker.com](https://gunbroker.com), which, by itself, should at a minimum double their last earnings.  This site generates ungodly sums of money annually.

On top of that, they also started inking deals with the pentagon this quarter.  Having U.S. military contracts is the next best thing to having a money printer attached to your business.  Congress and the pentagon are well known to sign off on damn near any military spending in front of them, and they ask little questions about vastly overpaying for military supplies.  Getting into military contracting is going to be a HUGE revenue increase for them.

Tomorrow they will also be talking to investors about forward looking data.  They already in the process of building at least one new huge manufacturing facility, and no doubt they intend to sign more military contracts, so their revenue numbers are going to be looking huge not only from what they have already done this quarter, but forward looking the next year."

Im still doing DCA regardless of the high valuations of the current market. Was just wondering what others r doing.

There is reasonable concern that if we hit those levels we can expect a fairly deep correction, that would allow for more DCA buying. Worst case we end up in a depression, I am sure in a few decades with money printing the way it is, we can accurately say, the SP500 will be 10k but the key a word is purchasing power. So in any case you will get growth as long as the FED prints and interest rates stay under 5%."

6/29/2021 0:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, June 28, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, June 28, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the Dow Jones (DIA) underperforming while the S&P 500 (SPY) and the Nasdaq (QQQ) kept pushing higher, with each recording new intraday highs, encouraged by the Fed’s outlook that interest rates won’t be raised until 2023. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell, hovering near 1.48%, an encouraging sign for equities. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for the June Jobs Report, set to be released this Friday. Consensus economists are looking for payroll gains to accelerate to 700,000 in June with an unemployment rate down slightly to 5.7%, with these metrics improving against May's payroll gains of 559,000 and jobless rate of 5.8%. 

Last week, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. 

Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, “The way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme."" 

Moreover, the Federal Reserve released the results of its “stress test” on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical “severely adverse” scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.

The results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs.

Looking ahead, market participants are gearing up for Q2 earnings season, which is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher.""

The dismissal deals a major setback for the agency's complaint that could have resulted in Facebook divesting Instagram and WhatsApp.

That being said, I believe higher prices will stick around for the summer and I don't believe OPEC will ramp up production until the end of summer when they have a clear sign that demand is here to stay. This makes sense to me logically, but it does leave out a lot of factors.

With EU coming back from the pandemic, maybe OPEC will be inclined to ramp up production to avoid oil prices that will compare to 2008-14. That would also cause US shale producers to react/invest quicker than most expect.

Oil prices are taking a dive today for sure, and I have actually bought calls today. I currently own Exxon, and I used to own Devon and Suncor, but I instead, sold the shares and bought ITM calls that are for next year that I plan on executing if the thesis stays the same. Oil is a swing trade, but I would like the opportunity to go long if I like what I see in 6 months. I do have price targets and also plan on selling majority of my oil trade at these price targets and evaluating if a long position would be worth it when the time comes. 

Today I purchased OXY calls for Jan 22, a new addition to my port.

I purchased MORE, Devon and Suncor calls. I did not buy more exxon calls today and actually instead trimmed my shares that I'm up on to diversify into the more leveraged names. I did not sell even 10% of my position though, I just wanted exposure and more leverage on my other names, as my Exxon position is very heavy, and I wanted to take advantage of the price action leading up to this OPEC meeting."

6/29/2021 0:00,stocks,"Thoughts on Grupo Supervielle (SUPV) What I’ve read ——Grupo Supervielle is one of Argentina's larger banking firms. Shares were trading for $30 as recently as 2018. However, the one-two punch of the recent Argentine economic meltdown and COVID-19 pandemic caused the stock to plummet to as low as $1.53 per share last year. The stock has rebounded to around $2.20 now and could have a lot of room to run. As it stands today, Supervielle is trading at just seven times trailing earnings, making this one of the cheapest stocks around both in terms of price and valuation. There is upside from a fundamental standpoint as well. Argentina is a large exporter of base metals such as copper. The price of these metals has soared this year thanks to the current inflationary wave. Furthermore, upcoming Argentine elections this fall could weaken the country's ruling left-wing party, offering a more constructive business climate for Argentine banks going forward."

There's nothing particularly special about this particular stock - overlay charts for YPF, TGS, BBAR, CEPU etc and you'll see similar trends. Stocks trading at a fifth of their historical high, wildly fluctuating +/- 20% at a time. I'll be looking to buy the dips with all of these, but I'd say for SUPV that's at least 1.80, possibly lower. Maximum upside then 2.40, not much more."

I understand that a lot of the market cap is based on it's potential, but is there any good reason to believe it should be valued higher than current dominant car companies like Ford? Even if the best case scenario plays out for Nio and they are a force in the future EV market, do we have good reason to believe they will have a bigger piece of the pie than GM currently does?

The only reason I can imagine the current justification would be valid is if we have reason to believe there will be a lot less competition in the future EV market and they will be among a few dominant players as opposed to a more fractured market we currently have.

6/29/2021 0:00,stocks,"ProventionBio is a steal right now I wanted to give everybody a heads-up with one stock, ProventionBio, as I expect this to go up significantly this year due to the release of a new drug in July. 
 
ProventionBio (PRVB) is a pharmaceutical company whose target approach is to prevent the onset or progression of disease. They currently have no marketed drug, but have one drug in the pipeline to prevent disease progression of Type I Diabetes. This drug, teplizumab, is expected to be approved on July 2nd. It has already been incorporated into the American Diabetes Association guidelines to be given at early onset to prevent/delay progression into full-blown Type 1 diabetes.
 
Here’s why I think PRVB will be worth significantly more after the release of teplizumab. Type I Diabetes occurred in 1.4 million adults and 187,000 children in 2020 alone. If half of these people were given teplizumab which experts believe to be very high (50-100 thousand per treatment course), this will make the company lots of money. The company currently has a market cap of 580M. If the cost of treatment is $50,000 and only 250,000 patients received the dose, that is 12.5 billion per year. Studies are also showing that many more diabetic cases in adults are caused by Type 1, and not type 2 diabetes, meaning that the market for this drug is only going up. 
 
The stock is a steal right now, as there was a setback for PRVB a couple months ago. All data from the clinical trial shows teplizumab to work well at delaying T1D onset. However, absorption studies were not consistent due to using old technology from when PRVB bought teplizumab from Eli-Lily. The FDA said that their absorption and other pharmacokinetic data needs to be more consistent before it would be approved. The company needs to just use more modern approach to developing the drug to get consistent absorption of the drug, which is very doable as monoclonal antibody based drugs are extremely common these days. Once that is fixed, it should be approved as an FDA advisory committee already recommended approval in late May. This drug did receive a fast-track designation due to its potential impact on Type 1 Diabetes. 

ProventionBio also has other drugs in the pipeline for Celiac Disease (currently no treatment) and lupus. I have great faith in this stock going way up in the next few years! 

I am not a financial advisor, but am a pharmacist, and just like the stock!"

6/29/2021 0:00,stocks,"Advice needed on $TTWO - Take Two Interactive Hi everyone. I predict that GTA VI (made by Rockstar who are owned by Take Two) is going to absolutely dominate the multi billion pound gaming industry when it launches, maybe sometime early 2024. I think that any announcements about it are being purposefully delayed due to the fact that GTA V (8 years after launch) is still incredibly successful, having managed to generate nearly a billion dollars last year. 

If the new game embraces the ‘Battle Royale’ style of gameplay made popular by Fortnite, PUBG and COD like I think it will, then it’ll be targeting an even more lucrative market: Fortnite generated $5.5 billion in its first year. 

Then consider that hype significantly impacts certain areas of the market more than most as a new wave of poorly informed investors (like me) have entered the arena, and news of a release date will certainly generate a lot of positive movement when it comes...

Then consider that any further lockdowns are likely to increase spend on gaming...

So my question is, why should I not put 40% of my portfolio into $TTWO now that it’s sitting at $178 (with a high of $213)? What am I missing? I’m sure there’s something, but I’m new to investing and I don’t know what I don’t know yet! Thanks!"

A couple of years ago I opened up an online brokerage account, and slowly started putting money into the account to play with the stock market a little bit with the intention of learning a little more about how the market works.  I was not playing with any large sum of money (it's all relative, but in my case after a couple of years of throwing money in I had about $1,500) as my real investments and retirement accounts are in much safer investments (mainly mutual funds).  The past few months I decided to give myself $1,000 of that account to essentially gamble in the market a little, buying and selling 1 or two stocks at a time every couple of days, using my 3 days trades most weeks, that sort of thing (no options or complex investments).

I have been trying to look into the tax side of things and (being typically a very cautious person) I just want to make sure I am not setting myself up for any tax issues at the end of the year if I keep playing with this account the way that I am.  I am sure I have run into the wash sale rule this year by buying and reselling the same stocks multiple times in the course of days or weeks.  I understand the basic concept of that rule, but not sure that I fully understand the tax implications.  I assume, at the end of the year, if I have essentially cashed-out that play account I would essentially just be paying the typical capital gains tax based on where I ended.  Is that correct?

6/29/2021 0:00,stocks,"Yield farming with covered $AMC options? 100%+ IRR I know 'option yield farming' sounds stupid, but hear me out why I am calling it this way.

Are you bullish or bearish on $AMC? Does not really matter and you can earn an extra yield on your position without risking any more dollars.

How? Very simple.

* If you are bullish on $AMC, write (i.e. sell) out of the money calls with the exercise price where you liked to sell your position. If $AMC shoots up above the exercise price, you just cash out at the price you wanted to sell anyways. And if the stock does not reach the exercise price before the option expiration, you pocket a juicy option premium.
* If you are bearish, write (i.e. sell) out of the money put options with the exercise price where you liked to close your position. As with above, if $AMC drops below exercise price your position gets closed out at the price you wanted anyways. And if $AMC share price does not reach the exercise price you pocket the whole option premium.

As AMC volatility skyrocketed, option premiums are staggering. One can easily find trades to earn 10% in a month. And then roll over again and again for the next few months.

That's 120% annual IRR.

Recently, we have [managed](https://www.specialsituationinvestments.com/2021/06/amc-entertainment-amc-options-trade-100-upside/) \+100% on selling $AMC options 3x out of the money. Crazy.

Again, all of this incremental yield is without any additional risk. Just additional return on your long/short $AMC position."
6/29/2021 0:00,stocks,"Taxable account tax question When it comes to “taxable accounts” please let me know if I got this correct.

1. Contributions are not taxed because you already paid tax on them prior to putting them into the account.

2. When you sell a stock you only pay taxes on the capital gains and not on the contributions.

3. When you reinvest the capital gains(that you already paid taxes on when you sold) they are now considered contributions and not taxed again.

So if everything above is correct...would I be taxed once I finally withdraw the “entire balance” from the brokerage account? For example. Save money for 10 years, paid capital gains each year on sold stocks, finally withdraw it all and pay off my mortgage. I assume not but I don’t want to make a mistake.

I just wonder how the government keeps tract, do they only watch the capital gains?Because if I withdraw 150,000 in one year thats a lot if they tax it again. But again this shouldn’t count because if I’ve been buying and selling I would have already paid the capital gains tax. Hope this wasn’t too confusing. Thanks!"
6/28/2021 20:04,stocks,"Assuming you are in the US, you are taxed only on INCOME (like dividends) and CAPITAL GAINS (like when you sell a stock).

""Contributions"" is the wrong term here. They are just transfers. Are you taxed when you move money from one bank account to another?

""Taxable account"" is also a wrong term. The account isn't taxable. The earnings are.

Some other countries have taxes on e.g. stock purchases and sales.

You are confusing yourself with retirement account terminology."

6/29/2021 0:00,stocks,"Pre-Market Trading Mechanics? Hi all, newbie here trying to learn about after hours and pre-market trading. Over the weekend I scheduled a buy order for Monday open at market price for a stock (NTLA) based on weekend news. NTLA is up 48% today but I only caught a .12% return.

Can someone help me understand how this works? Is there some sort of order or priority for trading at open? Who exactly was able to catch that 48% jump? Only those who held at close on Friday or were people actually able to get orders placed somewhere between Friday's price and today's open?

I tried to do some reading online and what I've found is that it is possible for retail investors to trade in after and pre-hours, but how exactly does one do that? Is that based on your brokerage? (I use SoFi)

thanks for any tips!

(p.s. I scheduled a market vs limit order because I had no idea how much the price was going to jump and didn't want to miss getting any stock by setting the limit too low.)"

6/29/2021 0:00,stocks,"Is anyone invested in Square? Here's some positive news but with sky-high valuations, is it a good buy at these levels? # SQ Stock Rises From Pandemic Crash

Most recently, Square’s first-quarter results released last month saw revenues climb a staggering 266% year-over-year on sales of more than $5 billion. Of course, in 2020 Covid-19 was just hitting U.S. shores and folks everywhere were being introduced to lockdown orders. And to be sure, it’s a low base for making comparisons. But still, right? Right!

Just over a year ago when shares initially struggled off the market’s March 2020 bear market bottom, most pundits were reading SQ stock its last rites on worries the failure of the company’s important smaller merchant base would drag Square down with them. The reality turned out much differently. Cash App has been a large part of that success generating gross profits of nearly $500 million on growth of 171%. And now SQ appears to have a couple more aces up its sleeves.

As InvestorPlace’s resident growth maven Louis Navellier recently discussed, Square has committed itself to building a U.S.-based open-source, solar-powered Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) mining facility. Along with the project reported to be a proof-of-concept effort, Square is looking to solve well-known challenges tied to Bitcoin’s egregious energy consumption and proof-of-work standard.

Similar to paying someone to store your gold if you had some in a safe deposit box.  The expense ratio you pay in part goes to the vault storage fees, auditing, etc.  Gold is extremely heavy so unless you only have a bar or two you wouldn't want to move it around, plus if you store gold bars in your house you are basically asking to get to robbed.  Since you own the underlying gold in the ETF, if the economy crashes basically gold will be more valuable and as such your holdings in the ETF will increase in value in tune with the price of gold, minus the expenses you pay for the ETF.  Like you said, also much easier to sell.  I personally think commodities are too volatile and would only allocate a miniscule part of my portfolio to any precious metals, just my two cents."

Also if the economy collapses, everyone will attempt to take their gold out of the ETF or sell it,thus plummeting the price of the stock.

I also don’t understand why you think commodities are more volatile than stocks, from my personal experience they’ve been much safer and retain their value.

Doesn't necessarily have to be the case, but for the past several months when TNX moves down too fast it hits banks, and when it moves up too fast it can hit tech (as there has been occasions where it's moved up a lot but hasn't). 

And like I said in the above post, the only thing that I can think of with V/MA is they somehow got grouped in with the reopening trade and all of that got hurt today.

6/29/2021 6:04,stocks,"It gapped down below all support, on Friday, which caused the sell-off at open (bulls closing losing positions). Yesterday, it gapped down even further, which caused the buying (bears closing profitable positions).

When it ran up yesterday, it bounced right off of old support, even with the second highest volume it has ever seen, and closed below Friday's high. It's been creating lower highs for over a month in a choppy bear trend. 

The only thing this has going for it is potential WSB involvement, because nothing on the chart says this is going to enter a bullish trend right now. It might, because weird shit happens all the time, but right now there's ~$2 worth of risk. If I did enter, I'd have a stop firmly planted just slightly below Monday's low."

Isn’t it?"
6/28/2021 20:58,stocks,"You forgot that inflation still continues even after you retire. By the end of the 30 years in retirement you’d be withdrawing over 160k a year. 


Also it would be rather unorthodox to continue holding entirely equity during retirement. Most people move over to safer assets such as bonds in retirement, which would reduce your returns. 


And no. Starting at $100k right now, and depositing $1500 a month here after, at 7% you’d end up with $1.68 million after 25 years. Which isn’t enough to retire on. At $8,460 a month, that’s $101,502 a year, or roughly 6% of your portfolio per year. The generally accepted rule of thumb is the 4% rule. Your yearly expenses in retirement should be only 4% of your portfolio in order for your savings to last 30 years, you sir are higher than 4%. That 2% difference doesn’t sound like much but it adds up due to its compounding effect.

6/29/2021 15:17,stocks,....except it is true. How could you get more than 15% on something that returns 15%? I am aware of how compound interest works. But if the APY on your CD is 15% it doesn’t matter how often they compound it. You’re getting 15% per year.

6/29/2021 15:38,stocks,APY on a CD includes compound interest. You will always get 15% after one year if your CD’s *annual* interest rate is 15%. They can compound it however many times they want. That is not the same thing as having a daily interest rate of (15/365)%.
6/29/2021 15:48,stocks,"I clarified several comments ago I didn’t mean 15% gains every day lmao. And then you proceeded to tell me that number of times per period doesn’t matter. I’m not arguing this anymore.

6/29/2021 15:59,stocks,"[https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/what-is-apy](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/what-is-apy)

If a CD's annual rate is 15%, you'll get 15%. The compound interest is already factored into the yield of the CD. That's different from any regular account with daily compound interest rates. That formula is literally just the normal interest rate formula A=P(1+r)\^t but you're using a different time scale, in this case it is a daily interest rate of (15/365) paid out every day. You're using a different r than what is given to you with a CD which are sold with annual yields that are not affected by compounding.

&#x200B;

Edit: I should say, that are not affected by compounding on any scale other than one year."
6/29/2021 16:09,stocks,"As far as I can tell you’re right with this. However, it’s my understanding that at one point CDs did have compounding daily interest rates. My grandma told me she was mad when she couldn’t get the “good interest” anymore. But she was old and probably didn’t understand it super well so this may not have been the case. I’m 27 so I’ve literally never considered using CDs, as they’re pretty much worthless nowadays."
6/29/2021 16:18,stocks,"Yeah looking at CDs is depressing, you’re lucky to get over 1% yearly returns lol. 

We both have a grasp on how compound interest works, it’s just a matter of terminology whether an investment has a normal compounding interest or an APY associated with it. It wouldn’t surprise me if they used to use normal interest rates but found that APY makes returns seem higher than when they use normal rates, so now they advertise APY instead."

Buy a SPY LEAPS if you fuck up. Sell PMCC against your SPY LEAPS. If you have under 25k, just trade SPY LEAPS and do PMCCs. Open 1 per quarter if you can afford it. Close at 50-100% gain"

6/29/2021 13:15,stocks,"The thing with you Jack and correct me if I’m wrong, but your mindset is likely “OK if I go all in with shares a REALLY bad scenario is a 50% drawdown in one of my yolos. In which case, I still have 1.25M and I started with fucking 35K” 

^ I feel like this probably takes you far, it seems a lot of people always seem scared you might blow your capital up. Which would suck but like ??? There is hardly a scenario now where you go back down to your principle amount. 

People treat their money too preciously sometimes, which is precisely WHY they will never see outsized returns.

6/28/2021 22:04,stocks,"You are, unfortunately, very ignorant. The question of whether a buyback is better than a dividend depends on 

1. Relative taxation of capital gains and dividends. RDS-B for example is a UK registered company. In the UK it is trivially possible for taxation on capital gains to exceed taxation on dividends. 

2. Inherent value of company vs. price paid. Let us suppose that the price of RDS-B was not £28, but £28000, with only £10 of assets per share on the books. Would it be reasonable for them to repurchase their shares at that level? How about £280000/share? £280000000/share? There is a point at which a buyback is value destructive; the amount paid for 1 share in the buyback exceeds the remaining discounted sum of cashflows that will be left to the remaining shares. 

> The only people who disagree with this simply do not understand taxes and/or basic math.

You are describing yourself. You are ignorant of taxation outside your home country, ignorant of the location of the company in question, and you are ignorant of basic accounting."

Also just lol Silicon Valley if you know how to network. Try about $120-$150k per year. For the record everyone makes a good $100k, if you don’t, safe to assume you’re homeless.

6/29/2021 16:40,stocks,I’m not sure about that last point. My understanding is the travel and vacation industries are experiencing absurd demand as everyone wants to go on all the vacations they postponed in 2020.
6/29/2021 19:08,stocks,Cruising is a very special segment of the broader travel industry. Even in normal times they have trouble bringing in new cruisers.

6/29/2021 17:03,stocks,"Pre covid stock price is irrelevant for ccl bud. Ccl has diluted their stock multiple times since covid. 1 share today does not equal 1 share pre covid.

Not to mention the fact that they haven’t been sailing for a year and draining money. While they may see absurd demand coming up, it’s going to take a few years until they are in a similar spot as a business pre covid."

Once you make that assumption, the rest of this is easy, but remembering the ""assumed values"" is a pain"
6/29/2021 4:36,stocks,How were you supposed to know you should assume $100? We did already figure out that the math for $12 works if that is the assumption.

6/29/2021 5:35,stocks,So they don't really know either. I wonder if FINRA would explain how.
6/29/2021 11:52,stocks,"From what I've read, I guess it's just an assumed value unless the value is provided. It won't ever be used in the real world, just for the SIE exam (and probably follow-up exams for related licenses)"

I bought Douyu initially to do some arbitrage since the merge at the time was certain. Still possible. I don't have a huge position in Douyu and if the merge doesn't happen I will most likely sell. This was my last buy on Douyu even tho I think Douyu can do decent without it."
6/29/2021 13:40,stocks,It’s so hard to tell if China would approve this deal giving them 80% share monopoly for gaming. Douyu is a better company than $7. They need to reinvent themselves and catch up to huya new innovation

I don't get excited by any offerings from VW. They have always uninspired as a company. I can't recall any innovations they've brought to market in the last 20 years. The june buggy and vw mini van were their claim to fame, made popular by the mainstream icons of their time.  
  
They look look conservatively luxurious but that's about it. Not hating, just have never met anyone that did not regret their purchase due to high maintenance costs and the frequent need to fix things. Canoo brings customizability, comfort, and convenience. I can't imagine vw introducing anything other than a legacy design/w updated electric engine."
6/28/2021 21:17,stocks,Ya how do you even know this? 100% BS
6/28/2021 23:32,stocks,"Because founding CEO's dont just up and leave a company they founded. This simply doesnt happen. So your two options are either they were running away from fraud or they were forced out. My gut says that this was a case where the CEO's had no power. Tony was making all the decisions against their will and basically told them to do as he says or walk. They called his bluff.

No matter what, there was obviously an internal feud and its clear as hell they didnt leave on good terms. Further, its not like those guys went off and retired. Ulrich took a job at Apple about a month later.

Tony Aquila, the guy who couldnt even finish high school, who did some very shady stuff at Solera, who lied about having 100 patents when he seems to only have 1 also said:

""...it was decided by our Board to deemphasize the originally stated contract engineering services line,""

Interesting how the founders arent even mentioned. Almost like they had no input on the matter..."
6/29/2021 17:36,stocks,"Thanks for elaborating. I just starting to follow the company, and from what I understand, yes-- Ulrich was likely ousted. However, I don't see it as a negative.

Ulrich, with his 20 years at BMW, has designed something that truly excites me. However, his business model was dilutive. He wanted to fund and scale the costly subscription model through partnerships /w other companies (Apple and Hyundai). Telsa nearly went bankrupt trying to go it alone, and this was Ulrich’s way to soften the journey to scale. As a small start-up with plans to build around a single skateboard platform, you don't want to reveal all your eggs to a major competitor for the sake of cheaper manufacturing. For the same reason, you wouldn't want another tech company (Apple) to have all the data you acquire from this next-gen lifestyle vehicle. You’d simply give them a competitive advantage over Canoo’s OEM add-on accessories and data collection points. Imagine Siri/Apple being so seamlessly integrated, that it becomes the customer’s first point of contact for anything regarding maintenance, accessories, or upgrades.

I can appreciate Tony's work experience as the founder/CEO of Solera-- Over 10 years in the auto software industry, gathering and delivering data to virtually every point of contact surrounding consumers. The executive level takeover would concern me if not for the sensical restructuring that emphasized sustainable growth through:

1. Greater control over brand equity.

Not giving Apple the option to release a model with IOS interface and pop-out apple branded VR headsets because they want to.

Protects consumer data through careful selection of hardware components and reducing potential for compromises to security.

Subscription customers, unencumbered by a responsible party, would destroy the vehicles. Outdoorsy adventures in the mountains (car camping); month long vacation in vegas; the set for my next porno movie. These things would compel me to rent an autonomous EV. Have you seen the lime scooters in San Francisco. Filth.

2) Data oriented to become the point of all contact for the provision of greater and more relevant value

Designing an ecosystem to suit different needs and lifestyles. High margin Add-on products because Canoo is similar to every other EV offered until consumers incorporate the modular components desired. How could Canoo capitalize on its modularity if partnered with companies that do all the manufacturing and distribution for you. This would cleave the potential for growth and relegate them to being a design house, versus a full fledged company.

Managing product through entire life cycle, facilitating transfers of ownership— tons of opportunities to provide incremental value through leveraging data and customer relationships.

I feel that Tony made the arrangements necessary for long-term growth by treating this product as the foundation for growth. Ulrich wanted to reduce the risks and rewards by piecing parts of the company out to others. He wanted to introduce a new business model that was disruptive to the industry, but constructed for publicity and generating acquisition interest. I’d sooner trust Tony’s understanding of the market to build a real company."
