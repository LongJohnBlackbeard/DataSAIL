Some of mine include SQ, ROKU, DKNG, PINS, GBTC, PENN and ARKG."
2021-04-10 19:56:28,stocks,If you’re not in a Roth IRA I would do that.  I just don’t want to pay taxes when I get old.
2021-04-10 19:41:59,stocks,Congrats on setting yourself up for the future. I'd go risk on if you have at least 20 years to retirement. Safe index funds at 50+. Whatever you decide to invest it in maybe roll some/all into a Roth IRA once your income is reduced. Get some sweet tax free gains. Talk to a tax professional if you decide to do that.
2021-04-10 19:27:38,stocks,"I'd say keep it as it is for now, your still going to be working so you have time for them to grow/recover in the case of a crash"
2021-04-10 19:47:44,stocks,"If you invest in index stocks (I'd recommend 60% in VTI and 40% in VXUS) by the time you hit 50 you'll have more than enough to retire. No need to get any riskier than that.

Or if you must, put $95k in what I recommend and keep $5k and do what you want with it --- I'd be curious if your $5k outperforms the $95k over the course of a couple years. The vast majority people don't beat the general market."

2021-04-10 18:46:57,stocks,I have SQ exposure in BLOK and MILN
2021-04-10 19:02:18,stocks,"Why not DCA into SQ?  No need to unload all at once. 

I have been consistently adding to it since it was $115 last summer and have built a nice position. 

I think this will be multiples of its present price in 5-10 years."
2021-04-10 19:06:19,stocks,If you want SQ exposure then buy SQ.  If you want Cathie to manage your $ then buy ARKF
2021-04-10 19:04:50,stocks,"I’m an ARKF bull, but it’s my only ARK fund that I hold. Like you said, I think SQ is solid, but I’m a little more optimistic on PYPL than you. I think PYPL is taking the hit on Venmo to grow the user base, and they’ll leverage it harder once they start their banking operations by integrating it. I’m expecting this around late 2022 or so, but I think the payoff will be there.

I’m making the bet that fintech will be one of the few growth sectors within non-FAANG tech that does really well this year. No clue if I’ll be right, but I buy ARKF low because I don’t want to buy PayPal and Square."
2021-04-10 19:31:44,stocks,"I'm in square but not arkf. If ur high conviction why pay a fund to rebalance risk, that being said it is risky for sure. 

Squares ability to bounce back from their previous woes (pivot fast) and overall vision and engineering is worth it imo. PayPal has been in the financial game for a very long time and hasn't moved as fast as square did the last few years. Also more sold on engineering at Square due to knowing the industry (tho I will admit this is a bias and doesn't mean a company is good just because engineering talent is better )."
2021-04-10 19:33:39,stocks,Why not sell some ATM cash secured puts on SQ and take advantage of some of that volatility.  You can run a wheel if it gets assigned.
2021-04-10 19:13:16,stocks,SQ is my solid stock at the moment. But thinking selling out to average my PYPL down as I bought it before the tech crash. Imo ARKF might be a safer bet. But the lady is too vocal and could slip on some words and chunk the stock
2021-04-10 18:55:20,stocks,SQ when goes back down below $210
2021-04-10 18:58:11,stocks,1% of your portfolio? Seems like a small enough chunk that you should be upping your risk-reward a bit. Go with MOGO if you’re looking fintech.
2021-04-10 19:51:45,stocks,1%? Lol what’s the point
2021-04-10 19:34:06,stocks,I had SQ but their core business profits are slim and basically tied with Bitcoin to generate more revenue.   I had to unload it when the Fed is subtlety signaling correction with all the bonds sells off on any sharp treasury yields.  Way overvalued right now for re entry point.  I’m bearish short term but I do like Jack ballsy move to make SQ as financial hub so I will take the roller coaster Long term on favorable price
2021-04-10 19:38:21,stocks,Oy. Good points. Maybe I will go with ARKF to reduce single stock risk. I see your thoughts on PayPal but cash app is something out of this world compared to Venmo. Reminds me of GS Marcus in its early days.
2021-04-10 19:54:48,stocks,Still a sizable amount
2021-04-10 19:55:40,stocks,If it was sizeable you wouldn’t be on Reddit asking for advice.

2021-04-10 17:35:54,stocks,Dividends. Some people love them.
2021-04-10 19:09:24,stocks,[Dividend compounding over 30 years](https://imgur.com/qqGV59d)
2021-04-10 18:14:41,stocks,"Some people believe dividend investing is a superior strategy. In reality, qualities that make dividend growth companies so great are the factors that can explain outperformance relative to the market. However, it’s not the dividend itself that explains outperformance. 

Personally I’m more of a total return kind of investor so I’m not really targeting dividends. But some people believe there’s downside protection in more stable stocks like JNJ and there’s a nice psychological benefit to getting dividends periodically. However, I would disagree that “stable” is really stable since disruption can come at any time, but I understand the psychology behind the thought."
2021-04-10 18:11:05,stocks,"I prefer growth stocks and the S&P over dividend plays because I still have a way to go until retirement. But if you are in a later stage of life and want less volatility tied to tech etc., and are more interested in dividends than growth, J&J is one stock that can fit the bill."
2021-04-10 19:38:49,stocks,So jnj has beat the sp500 since 1990 with dividends reinvested?  Nice!  Maybe I'll stock up on a few shares of JNJ!
2021-04-10 18:36:19,stocks,"Some people think less downside risk is better, but what they fail to realize is that missing out on potential returns is also risk.

For example.  They shun higher growth names as ""too risky"" and may opt for a 10% return from a more stable stock and over time miss out on all the outsized growth of the growth stock.

In the end if the growth stock wins out they risked more because they ended up losing greater potential return.

For example.  Last 10 years you had 10k in msft and 10k in sp500 index.  You acquired much greater returns being invested in msft.

So you lost more being invested in the sp500."
2021-04-10 18:31:42,stocks,Me too.  But jnj can help against volatility in the short term and 14% isn't a bad return.  Heck 10% isn't bad !
2021-04-10 19:38:14,stocks,"Ehh, I strongly disagree with your idea of risk here. I feel like risk involves the potential loss of something you **do** have, not something you **could** have. Otherwise one could argue that any approach that doesn't target the maximum return possible is taking on risk, and that doesn't really make any sense. If you get an 8% return on the year on your own stock selections, and the S&P gained 10%, you still **got money** (if realized). If you hit 3 bells instead of 3 bars on a slot machine, it's not like you lost money because you only won $500 and not the jackpot."
2021-04-10 18:49:24,stocks,"So, holding individual equities does not provide a higher risk-adjusted return than holding the market. And that’s what matters: having a standardized way of viewing returns which is why introducing the concept or risk-adjusted is so critical. 

Another thing is, people mistake volatility for risk. They aren’t the same thing. If you can handle market volatility, growth has shown an above average risk adjusted return relative to expectation. I don’t know if that will continue, but that has been the case in the past decade. 

Just some ideas to think about."
2021-04-10 18:36:43,stocks,"Full disclosure - I own a small amount of J&J in a retirement account because of their development of the COVID vaccine, in addition to everything else they have going on. 

Bought it in the summer and will just probably hold it forever.

EDIT:  I’m up 11% but don’t expect those as yearly returns from J&J. 

Meanwhile, I have several other stocks I bought during the same time up over 100%+."
2021-04-10 19:43:42,stocks,"All I'm saying is that over time growth tends to beat the market or at least keep up with it. That's what hindsight shows anyways.

Even JNJ and UNH have beat the market for a few decades. Uhh returned 21% since 2000 while sp500 returned 7%."
2021-04-10 19:41:17,stocks,"Because growth stocks do well when interest rates are rock bottom. When interest rates rise and companies need to actually be able to make money on their own rather than just loading up on cheap debt, growth lags behind."
2021-04-10 19:26:09,stocks,"All I know is that msft and AAPL and many other stocks have provided 2 to 5 times the return than holding only the market in the last decade.

If I invested $10k into DOMINOES or NVDA or MSFT or AAPL or lrcx or ASML rather than the sp500 I'd be much richer and consequently much happier.

Even boring medical stocks like TMO and ABT and UNH have beaten the market for over a decade.

TMO and UNH have returned an average of almost 20% since 2000. While the sp500 returned 7%."
2021-04-10 18:44:42,stocks,Most years you can expect greater than 10% return from jnj based on portfolio visualizer.
2021-04-10 19:30:04,stocks,There will always be winners and losers. Benefit of hindsight is identifying which ones won. I’d recommend reading more about risk adjusted returns to get a sense of how things should be compared. Best of luck with your investing journey.
2021-04-10 19:33:26,stocks,"Thanks.  I just keep 5% in each stock.  I also put a percentage in the Total Market too.  I have a diverse portfolio, save for a heavier weighting right now to msft and AAPL."

Wind and Solar have proven cheaper for grid production than fossil fuels, so they'll start taking over the grid field with future investment. With the EV boom, grid demand is going to increase heavily while the demand for potential chemical energy will drop. One company I invested in a few months back is Dominion Energy ($D). They're traditionally a natural gas provider but have realized this shift occurring and are investing in federal water wind farms. Currently they're the only company in the U.S. with one and they plan to expand it by 2024. Their growth rates are stable and dividend matches a low risk investment but it may be a good way to diversify while investing in what you actually care about.

If you want something more aggressive I have a DD on $PLL whose price will maintain suppression to around $70 a share until 22APR2021 before it can start realistically shifting again due to providing 4 banks with purchasing options at $70 a share."

Quite honestly, a lot of stocks are overvalued atm and retails will be last to know because Fed usually move in silence and give big players like the Goldman Sach signal first.  

I refrain myself for buying overvalued stocks for now.  Still cautious with some of my high risk picks too."

2021-04-10 16:01:31,stocks,Right now you'd have to lock up your money for 30 years just to earn 2.3% risk-free. Banks take credit risk on retail mortgages just to earn a few basis points over their cost of funding. They'd kill to make 3% risk-free.

UFPI's last two earnings reports were great, but the price did not rise with the earnings. Therefore, I bought a bunch of it. Now its P/E ratio is back up past 20 and I made some good profit from it.

And you can’t use it in every stock cause you need volume. Just think about it, if everyone would only use this kind of analysis nobody would start buying the stock up so you technical analysis guys couldnt even use this way

In fact, if you only use technical Analysis you will never be the guy who bought low and sold high.
You will be just the guy who is part of the cause the stock drops even faster if some paperhands, daytraders or swingtraders (I know they using tech analysis) selling without any fundamental reason"

I suppose that's how I see the difference, and my approach.

2021-04-10 16:21:38,stocks,"Technical and fundamental analysis are completely different from each other and can’t be compared. 

Imo, Technicals can be used for short term investing/ trading, but I believe using this method solely for investing for the long term is inadequate enough for a sound investment. 

Fundamental analysis is good for long term analysis because that’s how you find undervalued companies. What a company trades at today can be far detached from the fundamentals of a company making it undervalued for up to an extremely long period of time. This is something that technicals can’t really tell you."
2021-04-10 16:34:14,stocks,I don’t know what I’m doing. There are two lines on my charts. 200MA and VWAP. If the price is above those lines I buy when they dip to the line. Seems to bounce up often. It the price is below those lines I don’t buy.
2021-04-10 19:54:15,stocks,"Some TA is garbage, some is decent. TA can give you incite into the markets behavior and the general consensus of all actors. You can use this information to infer future behavior but it has no predictive powers on its own. 

It also has an element of self fulfilling prophecy. Some TA tends to be true because enough people believe it is. 

Fundamental analysis is different, if a company continues to post good earnings and rewards their shareholders the stock price will rise. However you could be waiting for a long time. 

The best way to select equities is to use a combination of both. Fundamental analysis tells you what to buy and Technical analysis tells you when."

But some people feel more comfortable and secure in their trading having a strategy while others prefer to wing it. Neither is wrong and neither is right it’s just personal preference."

2021-04-10 15:13:19,stocks,I’ve seen some people bash both fundamental AND technical analysis. I guess they’re the volatility and probability traders. So do volatility traders simply buy options when the Vix is low and sell them when it’s high?

2021-04-10 15:20:12,stocks,"How long have you been doing that for? My brother learned a little bit about fundamental analysis in his first few months in college, and then he started buying random stocks because he thought some of the financial ratios looked good. He did that about once a month for a few months and he made money, but I think it was mostly luck. He could have been right about the short term fundamentals of a company, but if the market were to correct a little bit, he would have lost money. And there is a lot more to trading than simply finding an undervalued company, there are important things like risk management and psychology. Sometimes he would think he found an undervalued company and he’d just buy it only to loose money when the company lost value over the course off the few weeks that he held it for.

I think that maybe there’s potential in something like yours, but it seems to me that it can’t be this simple, even as a believer of the “keep it simple stupid” principle."

Pinterest doesn't have much of a market to grow into, they can try to monetize their users more but the more you force the issue the more likely they are to leave for another platform. To make matters worse, Pinterest lacks long term staying power and there is a serious risk that they could fade into obscurity in 5-10 years. Similar products have fizzled out as the next generation moves on to the latest and greatest social media site.  Pinterest doesn't do anything that a new startup can't come in and do just as easily. They don't have the same opportunities for monetization that you get from a site like Facebook because they don't collect all of your personal information and they can't target ads as effectively.

The best hope for cashing in on Pinterest will be if one of the big players (FB, Amazon, Google, Apple, Microsoft) buys them out. Right now their valuation is too high for that to realistically happen, so it will either need to grow into its valuation somehow or suffer a massive correction.

Finally, in California cannabis accounts for about 8bil in revenue. About 1 in 5 citizens smoke. Mainstream doesn't mean it will go away or lessen.

Aside from Cronos, I think the ancillary cannabis companies are the way to play weed stocks because they don't contain cannabis and hence allow listing on the most liquid exchanges such as Nasdaq and institutional money can pour into these cannabis related names now/today as opposed to being shut out of other companies that contain cannabis because institutional money usually has mandates to not allow investing in something that is Federally illegal:

Hydrofarm (HYFM) - IPOed in Dec and a leading hydroponics manufacturer and distributor

GrowGeneration (GRWG) - leading hydroponics retailer

Agrify (AGFY) - recent IPO and a hydroponics growing solutions services provider

Weedmaps (SSPK) - unique, direct to consumer (DTC), cannabis play on the intersection of tech and cannabis. A type of Uber, Amazon, Yelp and Shopify all rolled into one for cannabis products. A SPAC that will turn into WeedMaps during sometime in the 1st half of this year. This one is special.

2021-04-10 15:46:18,stocks,"Most brokers allow you to have a margin account with less than 2k, but they don't give you any margin beyond your incoming cash amount.

If you open a brokerage account and deposit $500 and they give you ""instant buying power"" they are giving you margin for your incoming $500 dollars. The same margin they give you when you sell $500 worth of stock and can then use that money to buy more stock the same day. You have $500 incoming, it won't clear for 2 more days but they have confirmation that it is coming, so they let you borrow the money.

The margin they're talking about for over 2k is where you can buy more stock than cash you have, up to 100% more in some cases. So you can have $2000 and buy $4000 worth of stock.

No broker allows the second type of margin for less than 2k because it is against the law. Robinhood doesn't do it either."

Then they credited his account and told him to buy the shares at open (stock was up so that would suck) so he but the bullet and put in the buy. The credit they gave him hadn't cleared yet so it was rejected.  He ended up getting out near EOD after losing over a grand of his own money.

No but seriously, i think once you retire you can afford to live in lower cost of living areas, and if you are frugal like i am, i can get away with 20K/year (its actually what i am spending right now in higher cost of living area). But obviously this amount will increase over time with inflation... so in 10-15 years it's probably going to be 25K minimum.

People will hate to hear this but Virgin Galactic is kind of a gimmick. A company doesn't thrive from a handful of rich people using the product one or two times. The TAM is exceedingly low; how many people can afford the time or money to do this? Not everyone with the assets to do so will be a customer.

RocketLab is a real company with revenue, has a product and a growth trajectory in a field that is actually growing. Rocketlab has launched 104 satellites to date."
2021-04-10 14:47:51,stocks,"Hi.  I currently invest in both.  I see Rocket Labs as a space play that could distantly someday turn into an asteroid mining play.  I'm an techno-optimist, and I see that as a necessary and lucrative step for humanity.  I see Virgin Galactic as an airplane 2.0 play that just as they describe could become advanced transportation through hypersonic travel.

I like Virgin Galactic because largely it is the first mover in safe and reliable space tourism.  I'm sure someday that Space X or some company will start doing orbital hotel trips or moon trips.  But, I don't see that as a business threat because Virgin Galactic could lower their price points to market to address a different financial class of customers. 

I like Rocket Labs over the other available rocket companies (though if Space X ever IPOed, I'd switch over my investment very quickly) because Rocket Labs is ahead in execution and also they are vertically integrated and more diversified in possible future potential revenue streams.  It also appears that they are well lead, and I like that Peter Beck is building neutron. I believe that will take risk off of whether other rocket companies like Astra can launch at a lower cost than Rocket Lab's electron.

Between the two I like Rocket Lab more because it seems more of an ethical play.  Virgin Galactic focuses on entertaining the rich.  Though there is upside where it hopefully will get the rich space tourists to care and think more globally about the earth and the environment."

\- Steady stream of revenue

\- Proven rocket launcher, launched more than 100 satellites into orbit

\- Incredible engineering: consistent successful launches(better rate on insurance) and able to send customers to different orbits with their Photon satellite bus

\- Growth: New growing satellite business that will double their revenue

\- Competitive prices: Already costs less than SpaceX; reusability of 1st stage rocket will lower cost even more for customers

\- Business model: Many customers are happy, repeat customers

\- Even more growth: in addition to satellite business, new Neutron rocket to challenge SpaceX Falcon, will land on platform at sea or spaceports

\- Valuation $4.5B right now (dirt cheap stock price considering above, potentially lots of room to go up)

\- CEO Peter Beck is cut from the same cloth as Elon Musk

&#x200B;

**Virgin Galactic (ticker $SPCE):**

\- revenue? ugh, a big blank piece of paper

\- can't even get their rocket to work for years (around even longer than Rocket Lab, scary. You can stop reading right here)

\- business model: hard to phantom anyone would be repeat customer; one single loss of tourist life and it's over for your stock price (loss of satellites are covered by insurance)

\- growth? can't even get 1 working product, selling dreams only

\- valuation $6.94B right now (lots of room to go down)

&#x200B;

Sure the swings and gap downs can be extreme sometimes, but in the end, I've made a significant amount of money from them. There's circuit breakers that prevent the NASDAQ from dropping to 0 in one swoop, so I would pull out on it as soon as one of these major circuit breakers are tripped."
2021-04-10 14:17:59,stocks,"The decay comments always amuse me.   If QQQ drops by 10% and then pops up 10% the next day, it will be at 99% of the high - that's decay in a 1x ETF.   TQQQ has larger decay but it's something for investors to take advantage of and buy on sale.

The stock market tends to have a handful of days of large losses and a lot of days of modest gains, this behavior is ideal for levered products since they compound on the way up day after day (build a spreadsheet model and test for yourself). 

Have a trading plan for TQQQ, don't just buy and forget.  Buy it on dips with a stoploss.  Move your stoplosses up every few months when it rounds out a higher low.  If the market crashes, get back in when $MMTW rebounds and the market has a strong up day on high volume.   This requires a bit more work than the folks at personalfinance can handle but it's worth keeping an eye on the market once or twice a week."
2021-04-10 15:00:00,stocks,"If you bought TQQQ during the dot-com bubble, you would still be in the red. However, QQQ is up since then. So it doesn’t always outperform a regular investment strategy."

Disagree with wording that deals in absolutes like ALWAYS or NEVER. You sell the past 10 years of returns like it’s going to do that again with certainty. Dangerous assumption in my opinion. 

Here’s where I agree with you: Nasdaq will stay. Tech will stay. Here’s where I start disagreeing again: it doesn’t mean valuations will continue to act like they have over the past decade. We could get into a whole discussion of how the macro environment paved the way for this explosion in tech valuations. The logical next step would be to then discuss what the next decade could look like and why it’s unlikely to resemble 2010-2020."
2021-04-10 13:17:44,stocks,"Sorry, but no. No to all of this.

2021-04-10 13:50:00,stocks,"This has been my opinion on TQQQ. If you're young, there's very little risk as long as you hold, and continue to invest a fixed amount every month/year.

2021-04-10 15:01:48,stocks,"I was going to be one of the people warning you about the long term decay but it could work with DCA, i’m not sure. TQQQ has almost 5x the expense ratio than QQQ and that accumulates over the long term.

I suggest you track your returns over time, accounting for all your future entry points and benchmark that against what you would have gotten if you had just invested in QQQ. I suspect you would come out with higher returns over the long run but maybe around 1.5x vs the 3x due to decay and higher costs. You can then make the call as to whether the return outweighs risk of a market crash (30% tech crash will mean you will be liquidated to 0 - so if a black swan event like covid happens you will be wiped out). 

Would be interested to see your results after 3/6/12/36 months and also if it works it would be a good example to show all the naysayers (like myself) in the future. Good luck!"

Leveraged ETFs are great with low volatility, but in the current climate with 10y yields spiking overnight and the market generally on their toes on inflation worries and tech overvaluation i genuinely don’t think TQQQ will beat out QQQ in the next 12 months. 

When you backtest with data from 2007-2009 vs a low volatility period like 2012-2014 for example you’ll see that returns for TQQQ will be significantly lower than QQQ in 2007-2009 due to the volatility loss."

2021-04-10 14:25:44,stocks,"No, I was talking about TQQQ. But you obviously didn't read my comment.

If the nasdaq is trading sideways TQQQ loses money. A *lot* of money.

Say you have $1000 and the nasdaq goes down 10%.

If you've invested in QQQ you have $900. If you've invested in TQQQ you have $700.

Now say the nasdaq goes back up 10% the next day.

If you've invested in QQQ you have $990. If you've invested in TQQQ you have $910.

The QQQ portfolio has lost $10 but the TQQQ portfolio has lost $90. This is one of many reasons why TQQQ is *not* a good longterm investment.

Say the nasdaq drops 10%, you throw $1000 at TQQQ betting that it will return back up quick. In 5 days it return that 10% and an extra 2%. You sell TQQQ and keep your gains of $360.

Now assume you *don't* sell TQQQ and the next day the nasdaq drops 4%. You just lost 45% of your gains on a 4% drop.

See where this is going?"

Say you have 1 share at 100 that you bought last Monday. On this coming Monday you add another 100 but TQQQ drops down to $1 losing 99% of it's value. You buy 100 shares... Now when the stock goes back up to $100 (which because it's the NASDAQ, we can safely assume that it is a matter of when and not if) your position is worth $10,100.

2021-04-10 14:12:16,stocks,"Actually, statistically speaking outperforming securities will continue to outperform.  This is why ""buy high, sell higher"" exists as a mantra with growth investors. Or ""cut your losses and let your winners run"".

 Obviously there are stocks that were winners for a while and then turn into losers.  In the case of QQQ, those losing stocks would be replaced by up and coming winners.  This is why u/bangers132 is correct, TQQQ is a good bet long term for the most part.  It will stay invested the Top 100 or so stocks in NASDAQ which increases likelihood of maintaining an outperforming portfolio.

That said, TQQQ is not ""buy and forget.""  I recommend downloading QQQ history to a spreadsheet and building a TQQQ model for the years 1999-2003, it is sobering.   I have a lot of TQQQ in my portfolio, but I keep a stoploss in place and have a plan to get out if we enter a bear market and can get back in later."

You can't reasonably say ""apple will go bankrupt by 2021"" and you can't make a case for that because of past performance.

I am familiar with the QQQ history especially of the dot com crash. But from what I've read market analysts pretty much unanimously agree that a dot com crash may never happen again. Also the graphs that talk about back testing TQQQ through the dot com crash don't include additional cashflow/DCA. Also everyone says that if you sell instead of DCA you always lose potential profits. Stop losses will hurt you in the long run if you plan to buy the stock again."
2021-04-10 14:15:49,stocks,"Momentum is one of several factors that can explain performance, statistically. So true performance can continue for a stretch longer than people may expect. It doesn’t mean, like you said, you can pull a rip van winkle and check your portfolio in 40 years and expect to be worth billions. Also, sure you can make money doing this but what you describe is timing entry and exit points based on what you think are indicators of bear markets. I’d imagine for a leveraged etf you’d really need to time the exit properly right? So again respectfully I understand what you mean and what your approach is but conceptually some of the things you rely on tend to lower rates of return overall."
2021-04-10 14:10:25,stocks,"You clearly can’t say everyone understands because you appear not to. People should invest based on an analysis of prospective returns. Back-testing doesn’t give you that answer, that’s obvious. 

You use the results of your analysis to project future returns as if it’s a certainty that the leveraged etf will continue to behave as it has. That’s a misleading use of statistics. Stats don’t “work”, you make them work by using them for or against an argument. Everyone uses stats to mislead others it’s literally everywhere. 

Strong funds are strong because they were strong in the past. Got it. Everyone should chase performance then. What is strong continues to be strong, right? Guaranteed. Well if you invest based on past winners, you can look up all the strong funds over past eras to see how it worked out. I invest based on future expectations."
2021-04-10 16:46:28,stocks,"It's an example of a concept, not a reallife scenario. No cherry picking involved. 

And this concept is directly related to longterm investment as the longer sideways trading occurs the bigger the losses. Nasdaq goes down? *Huge* losses very fast.

If you're actively trading day to day there's no need to worry about decay. But, like you said, we aren't talking about active trading day to day. We're talking about long-term. 

Longer holding periods mean higher risk. As riskier assets outgrow their target weight, portfolio volatility will proportionately rise. When you start off with a high risk stock like TQQQ risk increases over time. That's a lot of risk.

If the stock market begins to drag or even go down and you're willing to sit on losses for 3, 4, 5 years then go for it. But most people aren't, and most of the time over longer periods there are better investment strategies than 3x leveraged funds."

I tend to agree that the Fed and US Gov are much more proactive in addressing market crashes since so many pension funds and 401k accounts are dependent on continued stock market performance.  A big crash like that would be worse shock to the real economy today that it was back then.  It's still on my outlier risk list.

Stoplosses can get whipsaw you, but like I said I add to my position on dips and the stoploss is about a 30% loss (vs 7% I typically use when buying stocks).  So I'll only get caught on a real downturn.

I have built a DCA model of the dotcom crash and it's still brutal for TQQQ.  I strongly encourage you to have a plan that isn't riding it out, but if TQQQ is a smaller part of your portfolio then maybe your ok."

Maybe I'll underperform TQQQ with entries and exits, but that's the tradeoff I'm willing to make to avoid a dotcom crash.  The return is high enough that it's worth it to me."

Say you bought 1 share for 10,000 at the peak before the crash. And it lost 99.9% of it's value you would have 1 share at 10. If you added another 10,000 after the crash you would have 1001 shares at $10. The chart says the hypothetical TQQQ never reaches greater than -70% of it's original value. Meaning that it never passes $3,000/share which you now own 1001 of. You've invested 20k and your account is worth 3 mil."

2021-04-10 15:43:55,stocks,Still wouldn't be possible. If you continually put in the same amount every month you would now be able to buy 1000% more equity with the same amount of money. Even at 100k shares it would only take 8 years to double that assuming a monthly deposit was worth 1 share pre crash and worth 1000 shares post crash.

2021-04-10 16:34:58,stocks,"It’s like they owned a $50k car and gave it to the bank as collatoral for a $250k cash loan. But they only gave the bank a promise on a napkin that they wouldn’t go to another bank with that same car and take another $250k out on the same car. 

They did this 5 times and then FOMOed into the top of the market and lost $2M. 

When the bank went to get the keys to the car, there were 4 idiots watching Goldman Sachs peel out the driveway giving them the finger."
2021-04-10 16:35:49,stocks,"They invested in something called Total Return Swaps.

These are pretty crazy contracts that allow the investor to essentially bet on the stock price going up without having to put up the capital to buy the stock.

They go to a bank and buy a contract from them that basically says if stock x goes up in price then I'll take the profits. The bank then goes and buys the stocks and holds it in a portfolio. If the stock goes up they take a fee and give the investor the rest of the profits. If the stock goes down then the investor needs to pay the bank the loss its accumulated from the price it decrease. This all happens without the investor having to buy any shares.

So its basically making huge bets on stocks without having to pay the capital to own them, meaning they can bet much more then they could if they had to buy the shares. It's kind of like a back room leverage deal.

Now imagine on top of this the banks gave the investor loans to reinvest more of this into these bets. So now the investor is basically super leveraged on the contracts.

When VIAC decided to make a stock offering at the market price, the price tanked a little. This got the banks making the bets worried since they are holding the actual stocks. Becuase Hwang was able to make bets with such little capital this made it so his small bets were actually causing a significant portion of the shares of VIAC to be owned by banks selling him these contracts. 

When one of the banks decided to unwind the contract, the price tanked and then another decided to sell and so on until the price plummeted to the point where the losses on the stocks were to large for Hwang to pay back. So now he needs to pay back the loans and also cover the losses for the banks from the price decrease.

It was a vicious cycle that started when VIAC issued shares and the banks decided to nope out of their contracts and dump all the underlying shares that he had bets on making impossible for him to cover as the unwinding of the contracts caused the prices to drop even further. 

The banks basically were lending so much to him through the  swaps and actual loans that it was a recipe for disaster. If one little drop in price happens on one of his bets the entire thing unravels."
2021-04-10 13:27:30,stocks,"I think the Bloomberg article did a decent job of explaining it. Hwang essentially operated in the shadows by making his money with derivatives. I can’t say I understand exactly how that works, but the key is that he doesn’t show up on any reports, whatever bank actually owns the underlying stock does. This meant that he didn’t have to disclose how much money he had in a certain stock, even to the banks that were loaning him more and more money. 

At one point or another he was operating with about 5x leverage, so 5 dollars for every dollar invested. Some of that is because Bank #1 doesn’t know that you got margin from bank #2, but how much the banks knew is also unclear iirc. But they also were perfectly fine making hundreds of millions of dollars from him without asking questions while he was running up Viacom and others with that much leverage. 

No bank will ever give you or I Joe Schmoe that kind of leverage, nor do you really want it imo. You’ll lose your house and entire life savings. What he did was basically what a lot of people did to GME except all by himself which is impressive. 

Goldman Sachs was smart enough to have Hwang blacklisted when he was caught for insider trading and wire fraud. The other banks deserve it imo. 

Anyway, the only lesson I took from it is that huge institutional buyers can run your stock up or crash it down without even owning the stock. Hopefully some change comes to that because a lot of people who just got in on these companies without knowing what was happening went down with him."
2021-04-10 13:48:21,stocks,They did a secondary offering to raise cash for the new streaming service Paramount+ which tanked the stock from 100 to 80 and then he got margin called for the swaps he owned as the swap price must have plummeted and he couldn't cover. So the assets (Viacom stock in this case) were seized by bank (Although the he never really owened then to begin with) and then sold to cover. that caused the rest of the slide from 80 to 40
2021-04-10 13:00:14,stocks,"Archegos has an amazing track record, but no investor is undefeated. Bad timing. VIAC has amazing potential and he bet the farm on it. VIAC owns the most top 30 cable networks among viewers between ages of 18 to 49 and 9 of the 10 original series with kids between 2 to 11 years old. The Company generated $2.2 billion of operating cash flow from continuing operations and $1.98 billion of free cash flow. As of Dec. 31, 2020, the Company had $3 billion in cash and $3.5 billion in revolving credit that hasn’t been tapped.

It just went the wrong way at the wrong time and he got margin called. It provides a good buying opportunity for VIAC for the retail investors at these prices. There are PTs in the 100s still and it’s in the low 40s... crazy."

What's the difference between his leverage, and say the leverage in a call option, which can be like 30x levered?"
2021-04-10 17:31:34,stocks,"FWIW you and I absolutely can get that kind of leverage. Portfolio Margin gives up to 6x if you have at least $125k or so. A whole bunch of us utilize that at /r/PMTraders, mostly for premium selling."
2021-04-10 13:42:31,stocks,"Thank you for sharing your take. I think he was using credit default swaps to get that type of leverage. Warren Buffet spoke against the strategy once because it allows the type of leverage you described. I love your take away:

So the losses were significantly worse and directly affected the banks. Options leverage doesn't increase how much money you can lose since it's just the value of the contract. Hwang ""invested"" the banks money they gave on margin which was great when he made money but also really really bad for the banks when he didn't."
2021-04-10 14:43:16,stocks,"I’m not totally sure, but there are different kinds of leverage right. If I buy options but not on margin I still have some leverage. He still used a form of option contracts so if you count that it was probably what like 1000x leverage? Lol"

Complement with a major LP or two if you must, retail and MO can fill it out. There you have a better ETF than what's out there. The major players at this point are the best way to expose yourself to the growth of the cannabis market."
2021-04-10 12:56:55,stocks,That’s probably smart but I’d like to hold it and I have more faith in a well run etf than I do in my own ability to monitor my stocks. I’m pretty hands off. I know it’s not ideal but I try to buy around that.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 12th, 2021.

# **Earning season is about to get underway and that could be a positive catalyst for stocks - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/09/earning-season-is-about-to-get-underway-and-that-could-be-a-positive-catalyst-for-stocks.html)**
*****
> The earnings reporting season gets underway in the week ahead, and it is expected to be a positive catalyst that could continue to send stocks higher for now.
*****
> The Dow and S&P 500 start the week at record highs after a strong rally Friday.
*****
> The coming week is packed with Federal Reserve speakers and important data, including a much anticipated inflation reading Tuesday, when the consumer price index is released. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell kicks off another busy week for Fed appearances with a Sunday evening interview on “60 Minutes.” He also speaks Wednesday at an Economic Club of Washington event.
*****
> Powell, in comments this past week, continued to reinforce that the Fed will keep its easy policies in place for a long time, and that any emergence of inflation should be temporary. But hotter-than-expected producer price inflation data Friday has made the consumer price index release Tuesday all the more important. PPI gained 1%, double the expected increase.
*****
> Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets, said he expects core CPI to rise 0.2% for March, or 1.5% year-over-year, but headline inflation should rise 0.5% or 2.5% year-over-year. Cummins said March is the beginning of a period where inflation could appear greater, just because of the comparison to low levels last year when the economy was shut down.
*****
> “I think the Fed has already moved ahead of it,” Cummins said. He expects CPI to peak at 3.6% in May but then calm down during the summer.
*****
> The other key piece of data in the coming week is the retail sales report for March, which Cummins said could show a 10% gain. The Dow Jones consensus forecast is for a 5.6% gain, following a 3% decline in February.
*****
> Cummins said March sales should be boosted by the $1,400 stimulus checks sent to individuals, which started reaching bank accounts in mid-March. More of the economy has also been opening up, as more people get vaccinated.
*****
> “The back end of the month should be very strong,” he said. “If you look at auto sales, that was the highest level in four years. It seems like restaurants are getting more crowded, with outdoor seating.”
*****
> # Earnings season
> But it may be the earnings season that is the real tell for the economy.
*****
> “It isn’t what they report,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. “For the first time, we are going to hear more and more companies now actually making comments about the future. Are they going to upwardly revise some of their outlooks or are they not? That’s what’s really going to be key about it.”
*****
> The big banks kick off the reporting Wednesday, with JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. Bank of America and Citigroup report Thursday. Morgan Stanley reports Friday. PepsiCo and Delta Airlines are also among the first to report.
*****
> “The consensus for the first quarter is earnings are supposed to be up roughly 22%. We have an easy comp from last year. That number could be closer to 30%,” said Brian Rauscher, head of global portfolio strategy at Fundstrat.
*****
> Rauscher said he expects the most earnings beats to be in the cyclical sectors, like consumer discretionary, financials and materials, all sectors that benefit from the reopening economy.
*****
> “I think earnings season is going to be constructive, and it’s going to be good enough to keep the market going higher,” he said.
*****
> Based on estimates and early reports, Refinitiv now expects earnings growth of 25% for the first quarter. Companies have been beating estimates so far at a pace of 81%. Earnings for the financial sector are expected to be up 76%. The consumer discretionary sector was hit hard by shutdowns a year ago, and its earnings are expected to bounce back by 98%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> “I think what we’re going to start to see is the operating leverage for these companies is really underappreciated. The earnings are going to start to come back faster than the revenues,” said Rauscher. “Corporate America has really done a good job in the last year of streamlining their operations, their cost structures and everything else. Revenues could come back 50%, and earnings could come back 100%.”
*****
> The major stock market indices were higher in the past week, but small caps lagged with the Russell 2000 losing ground. The Dow rose nearly 2% for the week, ending at a record 33,800, while the S&P 500 gained 2.7% to a record 4,128. The Nasdaq was the leader, gaining 3.1% to 13,900. The Russell was down a half percent at 2,243.
*****
> The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield stayed in the mid zone of its recent range. On Friday afternoon, it was at 1.65%, well below its recent high of 1.77%.

> # As Close to a Perfect Year For Equities as You Can Get

> Every day in our Morning Lineup, we provide a technical snapshot of the market looking at various metrics. One chart we show is the relative strength of stocks (S&P 500) versus bonds (US Treasury Long Bond Future) over the trailing 12 months (chart below). Whenever the line is in the green area, it indicates that stocks are outperforming bonds relative to the start date, while readings in the red zone indicate bonds outperforming stocks. What stood out about the chart in this morning's report was the fact that relative to one year ago (4/1 close), stocks have been outperforming bonds every day since. Sure, there have been periods in between where bonds outperformed stocks (falling line), but from a longer-term perspective, it has been about as perfect a year for stocks relative to bonds as you could imagine.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/040721-Bonds-vs-Stocks.png))**

> The chart below shows the performance of both asset classes individually over the last year. If you think the divide between political parties in the US has ripped wider, it has nothing on the growing divide between stocks and bonds. While the S&P 500 is up over 50%, the US Treasury Long Bond Future is down 14%. If we had to bet on which divide will start to narrow sooner, is there anything closer to a sure thing than taking the stock vs bond divide over the Democrat vs Republican divide?

> # Blowout Q1 Harbinger For More Gains

> Well-above average Q1 gains for DJIA and S&P 500 bode well for continued gains in 2021. DJIA’s 2021 Q1 gain of 7.8% is significantly higher than its historical average of 2.0% and the 17th best Q1 gain since 1949. S&P’s 5.8% gain was also substantially higher than its average of 2.1% and the 19th best since 1949. NASDAQ was the laggard up only 2.8% in Q1 this year, which is actually below its average of 4.1% since 1971 and the 28th best since 1971.

> In any event positive Q1 returns have been a harbinger for continued market gains for the year as whole. As you would imagine, subsequent Q2 and Q3 returns during the Worst Six Months are not as strong as Q4 at the outset of the Best Six Months. As you can see in the tables below, Q2 and Q3 post positive average numbers, but returns are lower than Q1 and Q4 and there are more losers.

> Further gains for the year as a whole failed materialized for DJIA in 1956, 1971, 1979, 1981 1987, 2002, 2011 and 2012 with lackluster performance for the remainder of the year in 1976 and 1992. S&P failed to produce additional gains in 1956, 1981 1987, 2000, 2011 and 2015 with weak gains for the rest of 1971, 1986 and 2012. NASDAQ failed to add to Q1 gains in 1974, 1981, 1986, 1987, 2000, 2011, 2012 and 2018 with paltry showings for balance of 1975, 1983, 1988, 2006 and 2015.

> Overall positive returns for Q1 resulted in full-year gains for: DJIA 40 out of the last 42 times with an average gain of 16.4% (median 16.3%); S&P 41 out of 45 times with an average return of 16.4% (median 15.6%), and NASDAQ 28 of 34 with an average gain of 18.9% (median 17.0%).

> # LPL Market Signals: Raising Economic and Market Forecasts…Again

> On the LPL Market Signals podcast, Equity Strategist Jeff Buchbinder and Asset Allocation Strategist Barry Gilbert update forecasts based on how the economy’s recovery from the pandemic, aided by vaccine distribution, massive stimulus, and the desire to return to normal, continues to surpass expectations.

> Strong March jobs report. The US labor market grew the most in seven months in March, as the economy added 916,000 jobs, trouncing the median economists’ estimate for a 660,000 gain (source: Bloomberg). Segments of the labor market most dependent on in-person interaction saw the greatest gains, notably hospitality and leisure. We expect to see bigger job gains in the coming months, potentially over one million per month into the summer, helping to close the gap on the more than eight million jobs still needed to get back to the pre-pandemic peak.

> **Raising U.S. and global economic growth forecasts.** An accelerating vaccine rollout, American’s desire to resume somewhat normal lives, and massive stimulus set the stage for booming growth in the U.S. economy this year. Our 2021 U.S. GDP growth forecast goes from 5—5.5% to 6.25—6.75%. A stronger U.S. growth outlook pushes LPL Research’s expectations for growth in emerging markets and globally higher as well.

> **Raising our 2021 S&P 500 earnings estimate.** With more economic growth comes more revenue opportunities for corporate America. Companies have been doing a tremendous job of adapting the pandemic, innovating, and generating efficiencies. We are leaving our year-end fair value target for the S&P 500 Index unchanged at 4,050—4,100 for now in anticipation of lower stock valuations as interest rates rise.

> **Raising our year-end target range for the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield.** Stronger economic growth and more stimulus spending may put further upward pressure on yields. We have raised our forecast for the US 10-year Treasury yield from 1.25—1.75% to 1.75—2.00%.

> # Global Growth Expectations on the Rise

> Before the pandemic we had begun to warm up to international stocks. Valuations relative to the U.S. markets had become increasingly attractive after a long stretch of outperformance by U.S. stocks compared with those in Europe and Japan. We had also anticipated that a weaker U.S. dollar would enhance international stock returns for U.S.-based investors.

> Then the pandemic hit. Since then we have maintained our preference for U.S. stocks over their developed international counterparts. In 2020 the U.S. market benefited from its heavy concentration in technology, digital media, and e-commerce stocks that are well positioned for the stay-at-home and work-from-home environment. More recently, as the Eurozone has struggled to contain COVID-19, our conviction in our U.S. preference has increased.

> “As the end of the pandemic has come closer into view and value stocks do better in anticipation of a full reopening, the environment should theoretically be better for international stocks,” said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “But the global dominance of the U.S. market has continued in 2021, in part due to sluggish vaccine distribution in Europe, and LPL Research continues to favor U.S. stocks over those in Europe and Japan.”

> A look at consensus expectations for economic growth around the world supports our preference for the U.S. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, not only is gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the U.S. expected to outpace Europe, the UK, Japan, and the broad emerging markets this year, but the U.S. has also seen the biggest increase in consensus expectations for GDP growth year to date—an increase of 1.9 percentage points to near 6% (source Bloomberg). Earlier this week we upgraded our U.S. GDP growth forecasts for 2021 to 6.25%—6.75%, while maintaining our growth forecast for developed international economies at 3.75%—4.25%.

> The reopening of the U.S. economy amid the accelerating pace of vaccine distribution is certainly a big driver of the increase in growth expectations this year. But massive fiscal stimulus—now over $5 trillion—is another key part of the story.

> The chart below illustrates how massive this stimulus is relative to the size of the U.S. economy (about 26%), and also how much larger it has been than the response to the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-2009. While U.S. stimulus is comparable in size to Europe’s, U.S. stimulus has included more direct payments and spending, and therefore has been more impactful than stimulus in Europe, which has included more loan guarantees.

> We continue to recommend investors focus their regional tactical allocations on the U.S. and underweight developed international equities. We also recommend a modest allocation to emerging market equities, where suitable, to take advantage of a strong economic growth outlook and attractive valuations.

> # A Goldilocks First Quarter Has Bulls Smiling

> Stocks have kicked off the year in a strong fashion, and history shows this may give reason to be optimistic for the rest of the year. After a solid—but certainly turbulent—year in 2020, the S&P 500 Index has continued to set new all-time highs in 2021, returning 5.8% in the first quarter.

> “Momentum breeds momentum, but you may not want too much of it,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Hitting singles and doubles has historically been the sweet spot for first quarter returns.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns between 5-10% have been the “Goldilocks” level in the first quarter, with an average return of 12.4% through the rest of the year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/revised-blog.png?ssl=1))**

> Returns through the rest of the year have historically been the worst when the S&P 500 is negative in the first quarter, averaging just 3.1%. However, too much momentum in the first quarter may not be ideal, either. When the S&P 500 has returned more than 10% in the first quarter, returns through the rest of the year have averaged 6.5%.

> 1987 is a year that is often referred to as the year of the “blow-off top,” as the S&P 500 returned over 40% through its peak in August, with over a 20% return in the first quarter alone. This was the only year with a first quarter return greater than 10% that was negative through the rest of the year, but removing 1987 from the data only raises the average to 8.7%, not enough to beat the 5-10% return group.

> # Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish

> Over the recent 21 years April is the top-ranked month for DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000. April ranks #2 S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Average gains over the period range from a low of 1.91% by NASDAQ to a respectable 2.30% by DJIA. The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. In fact the second half of April is just as strong over the recent 21-year period.

> Early April trading is usually positive for the first 4 days then flattens off around the seventh trading day. At which point, there is just a hint of weakness heading into mid-month. Then the market tends to resume its charge higher through month’s end. DJIA tends to close out the month strongest with NASDAQ closing weakest. This year the market is enjoying above average gains so far this April. NASDAQ is strongest, up 4.40% as of yesterday’s close. Russell 2000 is the laggard, up a modest 0.99%.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/stocks."
2021-04-10 12:51:31,stocks,Could TSM having a good earnings report be a catalyst for AMD going into their own report at the end of the month?
2021-04-10 18:54:38,stocks,"if Apheia APHA’s calls for May 21 are $25 it means TLRY tilray is estimated at about 30, is that correct?"
2021-04-10 16:03:02,stocks,What I’m more interested in for AMD’s earnings is updated guidance for the rest of the year. In Q4 earnings they guided full year revenue up 37% from 2020 while analysts expect ~52. AMD always guides conservative but good guidance from themselves could prevent the stock from dipping post earnings and prevent it from correcting after the pre-earnings run up.
2021-04-10 00:00:00,stocks,"What are your favorite scanners to use to find swing positions? I'm trying to expand my watchlist, but with so many possible indicators to use (MACD, RSI, TTM squeeze etc.) it's easy to get overwhelmed and tough to choose which to use when scanning for possible positions. I'm just wondering which have been the most successful for you?"
2021-04-10 14:00:26,stocks,"FinViz.

Common themes you want: low debt, good insider/institutional ownership, trading above your favorite long-term indicators but below your favorite short-term indicators, and make sure you look at the full historical chart to make sure it hasn't been caught in reverse split hell for 20 years. I look for very dramatic highs and lows and try to only trade near those."
2021-04-10 11:38:30,stocks,Finviz
2021-04-10 11:36:36,stocks,"Great question, I’ll be keeping an eye on the answers! I’m not familiar with any good scanners to be completely honest"
2021-04-10 11:36:09,stocks,A 200 EMA Always helps
2021-04-10 18:04:55,stocks,"Technical analysis is like astrology for investors.

Focus of financial metrics. Free Cash Flow, Sales/Earnings Growth, PE, and Price to Sales."
2021-04-10 16:31:22,stocks,I mean more of an imminent move to the upside or downside
2021-04-10 14:07:51,stocks,What criteria you looking at?
2021-04-10 13:45:13,stocks,"Noob here, how can I use 200 EMA?"
2021-04-10 14:52:11,stocks,all you could ever want from a stock screener
2021-04-10 00:00:00,stocks,"Investing in bonds Given the ultra low yield of bonds, who still actively putting money into bonds, and if so what's your reason?

Love to get some perspective as I'm mostly in stocks and would love some advice/pros of investing in bonds in the current market."
2021-04-10 11:29:23,stocks,"The basic utility of bonds is to generate some income and reduce overall portfolio risk.

If you’re playing with big money, bond prices are real sensitive to changes in interest rates, so you can make (or lose) a butt-load of money through trading bonds.

If you’re not near retirement age, most fiduciaries wouldn’t put you in a bond-heavy portfolio.

Edit: it also depends on your risk tolerance. If you’re suuuuper conservative, bonds might be more suitable for you than equities. You’re probably aware of this already, but this is more for readers who aren’t as familiar."
2021-04-10 12:06:15,stocks,Guy I know at Morgan Stanley who trades Muni’s said he only gets into them to trade later. Never waits for maturity
2021-04-10 12:28:42,stocks,"I have about 50% of my non-retirement account in bonds.  My reasoning is that although I don't have any immediate plans for that money, I might want to dip into that account in the semi-near future to buy a house or start a business, so while I can tolerate some risk and want to earn more than I could in a savings account, I still want a little more safety than a stock only portfolio could offer.  My retirement account, on the other hand, is 100% stock, because I'm young, and even if it gets wiped out by a crash, it'll have time to bounce back before I am even allowed to touch the money."
2021-04-10 11:38:53,stocks,"No, use preferred equities as an alternative"
2021-04-10 12:02:38,stocks,I really only use SPTS and BND as an alternative to holding cash when I want to hold onto reserve buying power.
2021-04-10 12:32:57,stocks,"You can make good money bond trading, but not bond investing."
2021-04-10 13:08:49,stocks,"I put some money into a bondfund. As others have pointed out it tends to be a safer alternative to stocks and in the event of a market downturn, the interest rates on bonds can fall, as well, meaning that the bonds you hold will actually have increased value by way of their relatively high interest rate. It tends to follow that if you believe that the market has become unsafe to confidently invest in due to overvaluation or what have you, it's better to move into bonds until your diagnosis changes. This is because although the interest paid out on bonds is certainly less than the average return on stocks over sufficiently long periods, jumping headlong into the market with all your cash just before a serious market downswing can put you back **decades**, and if you've invested it **all** instead of hedging with cash or bonds, you've just got to hold the bag or call it quits (most people just do the latter)."

My opinion:

40's: < 10% Bonds (LTT only)

50's < 15-20% Bonds (LTT Only)

60's > 20-40% Bonds (20% LTT / 20% Mixed)

70's - Dealers choice on allocation.

As for owning bonds before 40 for diversification, you can but I would simply allocate less than 5% of your total allocation for buying opportunities that you would back fill."

But it doesn’t take a genius to look at current valuations and realize we are in a huge bubble. Anyone who doesn’t recognize that is an animal.

2021-04-10 16:02:19,stocks,"The Dow  tripled over the last 10 years because the earnings justified the price just look at the increase in earnings of the top 30 companies , sooner or later the stock price will match its earning results. If the S&P companies can even double their earnings S&P may reach 10,000, IMO 500 companies doubling their earnings or even projected earnings for that matter is a huge ask, sure the more weighted in companies may grow my much more but then you also will have much of them slacking.

The liquidity around has been to recover the economy, not to propel it and the fed knows this, print enough dollars and the S&P500 may even reach 20,000 but the value of dollar will drastically drop. Though I must admit Dollar Index as of now suggests other wise, also Bond Yields rising could have multiple comprehensions and rising yields may be perceived as growth in the economy.

I am not a pessimist, but there is one thing that glaringly concerns me have look at the long term trend line and the 200 day moving averages whenever the prices strays too much north of these it is usually a sign of trouble.  Let's say, that the growth rate is way better now even then the price must be close to the 200 day moving average(exponential at least).

It is inevitable that the prices and the 200 day moving averages, now there are two possibilities-

* Either the market dips/corrects/crashes or
* The market stay round about here and gives a time correction and the earnings follow expectations and the 200 day moving averages rise to meet the current price.

&#x200B;

But, then again like Lynch has said ""*Way too much money has been lost in preparing for a crash then actually in the crash*"".

Stocks always go up, but sometimes they go down or stay stagnant before going up.

When you look at the historical gains of the S&P it usually gives the return that includes dividends but you are only talking about it hitting 10,000 so you can't include dividend gains.

If you look at the annualized return for the S&P since the end of WW2 you see it's 11.035% including dividends but 7.447% without dividends.

That said, there are a ton of other things working against the market too. For one, we're starting out the decade with loans and money very cheap and a huge influx from the federal government. Unless the government is going to collapse itself in 10 years then both things will need to change. The market is the only logical place to put money right now but that should change quickly over the next 2 years.

But inducing government spending on things like infrastructure and “next-gen” technology actually has the opposite effect of what you said. Yes more money is needed, but that money is flowing straight into lower to middle class jobs that are good paying without the need for college. So inflation is not just a guaranteed positive for rich people. If spent efficiently, it’s a positive for the middle class with minimal affect on wealthy assets.

And careful with the dip mentality. There was a fantastic post on Reddit in the past comparing dollar cost averaging, lump sum investing at the beginning of the year, versus waiting for the biggest crash each year, whether it was 30% or 8%. It also compared people who waited for those 20+% crashes whether it was 3 years apart or 10 years. In general, if it's an IRA then you can only invest once a year so mathematically you're better off putting it all in on January 1st. If it's a retirement account with matching or a brokerage then lump sums as soon as possible or DCA is still best. People who time the market end up waiting long periods of time and usually miss the gains before the crash. Obviously there are some worst case scenarios like a lump sum before a huge crash, but then that's the advantage of DCA when you're buying during the dip too."

Investment is easier than ever, way better than timing the market, which the latter might give psychologically unbalanced mind every day.

Idk if I’d call making mostly small personal sacrifices to save the lives of the elderly and immuno comprised ‘soft’. Let’s try pragmatic and humanitarian. Pretty idiotic take on that. Japan hasn’t been the worlds second largest economy since like 2006, and at that point it was completely contingent on auto manufacturing. The US’s global presence is highly diversified.  Also Japan had a strong presence in developed economies, not emerging ones. They don’t drive Japanese made cars in third world countries. Markets don’t crash bc of their size. Japans economy crashed for a litany of reasons, but the foremost was an insane credit crunch.

on Japan do more digging and research, on why their economy and markets tank and lost a generation when it topped. It's not because it didn't invest in emerging economies it didn't have to begin - Japan owns some 80%  US t bills and Japan was the king of asia - when it was all undeveloped and emerging - it literally funded all the economies of Asia.

Sold some in the last months to diversify my portfolio from 80% tesla to about 35% now.

Do I regret it? Yes and No 

I would have made more money holding TSLA all the way instead of trying stuff along the way, but I am very young and I don't want to purely depend on one stock my whole life, even if it's the best company there is. I barely had any money to begin with and cashflow as a student is limited.

So, yeah TSLA was basically my golden ticket to a diversified and somewhat larger portfolio. I learned a lot during the last 4 years and I am confident in all my newer picks. If they will outperform TSLA remains to be seen, but like I said it's not only about returns."

Got into stocks in 2011 which eventually became the cornerstone of my brokerage portfolio (GOOG, ISRG, JNJ) and also kept putting into my IRA.

I was in HS in 1988 during that crash and remember my dad telling over 1/2 my college savings got wiped that day. He didn't seem too concerned, maybe because I wasn't much of a student and he didn't think I'd go to college, but that's for a different post...

Anyway, I open an IRA finally in 2017, and consistently beat the market by a few points just buying & holding stock. Fortunately most of my picks were pretty good, but that is more a factor of the stocks being consistent outperfomers, not my stock picking acumen. AAPL, MSFT & V all netted me solid gains over the past 3 years. But I wasn't lighting up anything, just making a few bucks since it was a Roth IRA and I could only start with $6k.

The odds are you won’t. Most people lie about stuff on here anyway. I can’t tell you how many people said “I bought TSLA in March and I’m up 500%!” Just to look back at their posts/comments and find out they actually bought it a few weeks ago and are down 10%, and just wanted to feel cool. 


> How long did it take you to really starting making money?! 


A few years. Started taking investing seriously when I was 17, I’m 22 now. I’m hoping to be a millionaire by 25, then a multi-millionaire by 30. 


Made a lot of money in “the coin that can’t be named on this sub” in both 2017-2018 and 2020-2021. Made a lot of money on MSFT and V. Lost a lot of money on WFC due to a bad decision made from ignorance when I started.

For me I count that as the point where I started, since I didnt really make profit before that point and didnt do anything. It was somewhere mid november. I havent had long term stocks, made almost all my money sith pennystocks and some bigger swing trades like pltr and nio. 

Now 5 months later my portfolio is worth €49k which is a 600% increase, this might not be a huge amount of money for most of you, but im 21 and making €42000 in 5 months is amazing for me, especially since its for basically doing nothing.

Also its important to know: bad days will make you appreciate the good ones more."

1) the risk category of my stocks

2) the $ amount that I am away from getting margin called 

3) the overall market
 
A little more detail:

1) Every broker calculates the available margin differently. For me it highly depends on the risk category of the collateralized stocks according to the broker. High risk stocks can't be used as colleteral. So, I have to be aware of changes, but I get notified of any changes a week prior. 

2) I always keep a heavy buffer, so I don't ever get margin called. 20% margin is the absolut max for me. 20% margin can become 30-40% real fast if your portfolio is tanking. You should avoid margin calls at all costs. 

3) The overall market conditions can have an impact on margin requirements. That's also why a large buffer is key.

Hope that helps."

2021-04-10 08:28:02,stocks,Nice self control! I on the other hand am a margin maxer. Pro tip those interest rates are negotiable. When you start using large amounts of margin you should be able to call your brokerage and shave a percent or two off.

So for instance, if AAPL is down (like what was the case last month), I lever up to buy a much larger position and close out a portion after a runs up to profit and increase the long position I have in it. Currently waiting for ER to unload some of the shares bought or will just sell calls to pay down the margin used instead if IV is paying good premiums. Not a strategy for everyone and be respectful that margin can blow up your account if you don't use a clearly defined set of rules and follow them.

2021-04-10 13:27:27,stocks,"Not OP but I assume they’re referring to diversifying investments to ensure you don’t get margin called if eg. tech sector has a large correction.

Conventional investing wisdom is to have some % allocated to bonds and REITs to give you some stability if stocks get rocky, and that you can use to pay off your margin if it comes to that.

If you’re not adequately diversified margin will just amplify market trends. If it’s going up you’ll make a lot, but when it corrects (or worse, crashes) it will hurt hard and you may have to sell off a large chunk of your portfolio to cover."

It doesn't seem to be significant news either way, but I'm trying to make sense of the language as an exercise and I just can't. The whole article is just a few sentences. 

At first, ""gain on pension obligations"" seemed to me like they owe more money than before in their pension distributions, and if that's all they're saying, then fine. I get it. But then this sentence: ""The $2.8 billion non-cash gain it will record in the first quarter is mostly a result of an increase in the discount rate used to measure the obligation.""

Pension obligations are the benefits they would have to pay out when someone retires. Most of these payments occur in the future so they get discounted back to a present value.

My question is, where are the signs of an upcoming crash (if any)?

In general, what are the signs to look out for?



**EDIT AND UPDATE: Thank you all so much for your responses. Some comments in this post are quite complex for an investor like me lol, but in general I’ve got the idea that all of these stimulus checks, the unemployment numbers, the overvaluation, the excessive money printing, the sneakiness and deceptiveness, all of it shows that a market crash is on it’s way, but that it’s not something to be very worried about for the immediate future.**

**I’ve seen people’s estimates range from next week to never lol, but what I’ve learnt from this is that it’s not possible to totally predict a crash, although they are indicators and events that suggest one may be nearby, and that it’s good to have a decent cash reserve on hand to buy at lower prices and to average down.**

Second is if inflation ratchets and big players feel like the fed will be forced to tighten.  This will cause our beloved growth stocks to take a 25-50% haircut quite quickly.  Stocks like AAPL and MSFT could lose 25% no problem.  Stocks like ROKU, SHOP, TSLA, etc... could lose half their value.  This is valuation 101.

That alone is not enough for a crash.

Those conditions being the things mentioned here like the leveraging issue, the increased retail investor issue, the higher than average P/E multiple issue, among others.

Not because of an extended bull run, or inflation (only partly). 2008 was nothing in comparison. Two words: Bond Rehypothecation. Michael Burry (the guy who called 2008’s crash) is even predicting it. It’s a conglomerate of WallStreet being greedy and over leveraging, the fed being dumb and shady, and a decades long worth of inflation being downplayed and hidden. There’s a needle coming that will pop the countless bubbles one by one. Just pay attention to market news, Archegos margin call, Melvin -49% 1st qtr, Maplelane bankruptcy, ATH’s across the market (sound familiar 2008)."

2021-04-10 10:59:58,stocks,"Mainly rampant fraud.  You see rampant, blatant fraud being committed its time to secure yourself.  Bubble pops....meh the market will come back up after a brief correction period.  Bubble caused by Fraud pops.....it'll be back up but the ride will be wild and it'll be a bloodbath on both Wall Street and Main Street.

1929- Credit Fraud combined with changing Banking regulations (that would have been, and was considered by many average people, fraud a year earlier) and the introduction of modern style economics (money printer go brrrrrr) to create a doozy of a depression.  Financial Fraud on every level in the markets and governments around the world, defaults on war debts and treaty obligations due to worthless currency caused by over saturation caused by the need to make those payments on time (Weimar Republic).   The Global depression leading into WWII was caused by the defaulting of the Weimar Republic on the Treaty Obligations resulting from the end of WWI.  The money promised to the former Entent powers was used and spent prior to receipt (on credit).  Combined with the rise of the Credit Card concept it was a recipe for economic disaster in a time when Identities could not truly be verified,  many credit line bills went into default unable to be collected due to the credit company's having fraudulent information.  Closer to home, the idea of a central bank was still new, the introduction of regulations to limit onsite capital in the actual banks lead to Balance Ledger transactions with no cash actually changing hands or accounts....your money, that you deposited in your account was not actually there (it still isn't)....this was fine until a simple Butcher who had never written a check or used credit in his life went to go withdrawal money he had deposited to replace a piece of equipment.  When the bank told him they didn't have the actual cash and he would have to write a check....he was mildly perturbed to say the least.  He wrote an Op-Ed for the local papers that seems to have been syndicated nationwide and the Bank-run was on.  This Coincided with the Global Market crash leading into the Great Depression.  Nothing I've ever read on the incident indicates what happened with the equipment.  Not important....but I'd like to know.

1999-2000- Bubble caused by excitement in a disruptive technology (dot com bubble, the internet was still too new yet).  Mild, short term discomfort but overall no long term negative effects.  Limited Fraud at the time, mostly Overvaluation of businesses using as yet unproven technology that was still ridiculously slow at the time.

2008- Mortgage & Mortgage Bond Fraud....amongst other things, combined with the Wall Street bailouts causing the ""Great Recession"".....I would argue that we are still not out of this.  The Markets recovered, not so much the economy.

Skipped a few in there but you get the point.  If you see Rampant Fraud going unpunished/caught the Market will punish it itself,  those are always the bad ones.  The Bubble Pop crashes are generally pretty short and more corrective than anything else.

I would worry about the US Treasury Market and what's going on there.....there is some funny business going on.

Not Financial Advice, just my opinion on what to truly worry about out there, big picture."

2021-04-10 10:05:36,stocks,I think every year since like 2017/8 people have been calling for a major crash. As much as you can look at march 2020 as a crash the general market was and still is a bull market.
2021-04-10 11:17:23,stocks,"I think there are several reasons but the main one is that so many new retail traders have entered in the last year and really don't understand the underlying mechanics of the market. They get their information from social media and click bait articles that preach the apocalypse and then think that's it.

Everyone that just starts out investing has to learn, we all have been through it before, but when I started investing it wasn't very popular and social media was a place to lookup old friends only.

I had to study and research all the ins and outs and learned the hard way by losing money about the basics of the market. I'm still learning to this day which is great.

Now 1 guy can post a tweet and it becomes viral and people who haven't had time to learn how the market work all of sudden start spreading things like this becuase it gets more attention.

Negatively bias plays an important role in this as the media gets more clicks and insta stars get more follows when they report exceptionally negative things.

Truth is the market will have a correction in the future, that's pretty much guaranteed but when it happens and how long it lasts no one knows."
2021-04-10 12:15:33,stocks,Because pragmatism leads to people thinking the market is overvalued most people “seem” smart/safe by calling for a correction/crash. It’s likely that reason we continue to see the market grind/melt up rather than have a huge correction.
2021-04-10 12:26:43,stocks,"Basically, we have a very long bull run. The longer it lasts, the more likely it is that a crash will happen soon. Rising interest rates, inflation and high valuations on the markets are often seen as harbingers. And yes, some companies are currently very highly valued, especially in the clean energy and tech sectors. But most other companies, in my view, are not yet insanely highly valued. And yes, medium-term interest rates and inflation are rising right now, but I don't think that's a long-term trend. We're still a long way from full employment, and prices in some areas that are considered harbingers of inflation (oil, real estate, agricultural products) are still not particularly high. I think it's much more likely that all the scaremongering will trigger a selloff than that any of the three indicators I just mentioned will.

Addendum: Often the people who warn that a crash is imminent are those who have been sitting on the sidelines for a long time and missed the bull market."

Some hedge fund just bought a huge VIX contract, if I think of more I'll add them in. Indexes break out to new highs but fails to have much of a follow through.

As long as the printing is ongoing and the fed is artificially propping up MSB’s, junk bonds, repos, et cetera, nothing to worry about. That is unless the BLS reports accurate CPI number which would put current inflation between 6-8%.

We’re in a massive asset bubble. The government can’t pay its debt and we haven’t had a balance budget in 20 years. The government issues tbills to fund the yearly deficit and the fed buys them (along with other governments) from issuing banks. The government goes further into debt and prints more bonds which the fed buys. Charles Ponzi would be proud."

There isn't an unbalanced focus on dealing with the pandemic, getting vaccines made, getting PPE etc etc. Essentially all pandemic related booms are dying down and there isn't going to be a plain black and white market focus to take over.

2021-04-10 13:16:12,stocks,"It has something to do with rehypothecation of 10 year treasury notes in repo markets. The collateral has been borrowed and lent so many times there's more debt owed than is possible to repay and the exposure has been mixed around amongst a lot of major players. 

Effectively shorting the 10 year is causing the prices to come down and yield to go up. If some kind of catalyst causes someone to default it could set off a chain reaction that collapses the bubble.

2021-04-10 12:51:09,stocks,"The stock market has been propped up by a handful of mega cap companies leading up to the pandemic. 5 companies make up around 20% of the SP500. Those companies have done well throughout the pandemic as opposed to the smaller - medium cap ones. This may not be the best view when it comes to how well companies are doing. Borrowing for stocks has been at an all time high now too. You can even vouch that the Fed has been artificially propping up companies by buying Corp bonds during this as well. I do see where a correction sentiment is coming from.

But also, there’s been a renewed hope towards faster economic recovery due to rise in Covid-19 vaccinations, stimulus checks, future recovery plans, and a divided congress that have kept stocks fairly stable/growing. When it comes to inflation, it’s tough to predict on the scale it will occur. Not all stimulus checks were spent on goods/services, many people saved or paid off their debt with the funds. Inflation rate has also been below the target rate of 2% anyway, so the Fed may not necessarily be in a hurry to increase the federal funds rate. 

Better to be in the market than time the market. When others are cautious, it’s time to be greedy. I’d recommend doing some dollar cost averaging or diversifying your portfolio to decrease your risk."
2021-04-10 17:50:38,stocks,"Many people calling for a crash are linking the thread from the everything short in the GME subreddit. Keep in mind, some of the most upvoted threads there are ""idc about the money, diamond hands."" A lot of the statements made or DD posted there is just fundamentally wrong too. And when people call them out, they get called a boomer, shill, or paper handed bitch. 

I wish them the best, but I also know some people have lost a ton of money in GME due to online influence and DD. The people I know either cut out their long positions in growth stocks to gamble or just started trading with GME. Now, many of these same people are hoping the market crashes so they can rebuy back in. I made my profit off the first jump, and never bought back in. 

People can be really greedy and hope for really bad things for their gain. Remember, we are investing in companies, made up of people, whose lives and jobs depend on these companies. Calling for a market crash is no different than shorting or buying puts, which is exactly what they are targeting hedge funds for. It's sort of hypocritical. 

Personally, I think hedge funds are playing both sides and profiting either way. I remember seeing one thread when the market was red, and someone said in it ""it is obvious they have shorted the whole market and this is why we are down.""

If you believe the market is going to crash relatively soon, then buy puts. I keep seeing people calling for a crash, but don't intend to profitize off of it. This means to me they are literally just hoping to buy in long due to a price drop."

I think equities will be the best option for the next year at least. Maybe things won’t grow as red hot as they have been, but the SM has new highs on the horizon"
2021-04-10 18:42:23,stocks,"Market crashes=I buy more

2021-04-10 10:24:42,stocks,Disregard the bears.
2021-04-10 11:46:36,stocks,Market corrected 2 weeks ago. They're salty they missed the boat.

A few - like DIS - will stop dividends but the great companies keep paying."
2021-04-10 17:45:41,stocks,The market has been red mostly for quite some time now so I am guessing something is not right. Something is going to happen soon..
2021-04-10 10:47:29,stocks,"Same, remember SPY puts last April? People convinced the markets were going into meltdown and the recovery was just a 'dead cat bounce'. My portfolio is sitting nicely at about 50% gains over the past year, if I'd listened to the bears crying bubble and crash imminent I'd be at 0% gains. I'd rather take my chances in the market than trying to make a futile attempt of predicting when the next crash will come."
2021-04-10 11:28:54,stocks,"I'm just waiting for any kind of correction to buy in. 11 green daily candles in a row is a little ridiculous. Don't think we'll crash or go bear anytime soon thanks to the dovish Fed though

Edit to respond to everyone below: it is not normal for a crack-up boom like this to happen.  The market is 25% above february highs before covid.  Would you say the economy is in a better position now than it was then?  Valuations are out of control.  I am not saying this won't go higher - in fact I think it will go much much higher much faster with all the Fed assistance.  What I am saying is that the current SHORT TERM action of 12 green daily candles is unnatural and requires a SLIGHT correction to climb in a healthier manner."
2021-04-10 16:03:02,stocks,"It’s been going on way longer than that, there were heaps of bears in 2018 and 2019."

2021-04-10 18:12:22,stocks,"Last year the future looked bleak.  It now looks bright.  There will be corrections, but as long as people keep putting their money into the market, the recent optimistic gains equities have made may prove to be warranted."

2021-04-10 12:53:12,stocks,Weve only been on a bull run for a year since the covid crash lol. Last bull run lasted a decade.
2021-04-10 13:13:38,stocks,Covid that crashed the market more than 50%: “Am I a joke to you?”
2021-04-10 09:38:03,stocks,"We have not been in a long bull run.  There have been two crashes, one in 2018 and one in 2020 that were very clearly bear markets.

People just keep throwing those crashes down the memory hole because the essential thesis for people who focus on impending doom is the idea that we’re “due”. Which I find to be insane.  It’s just another manifestation of the gamblers fallacy"
2021-04-10 13:35:01,stocks,We are in a secular bull market
2021-04-10 13:06:12,stocks,Fixed income bubble is a little scary yeah. I don't see why noone else is really talking about it but when interest rates invariably go up it's going to pop and it's not going to be pretty.
2021-04-10 14:33:28,stocks,I would love to learn more about this. Any links to articles or videos on the topic?
2021-04-10 16:28:04,stocks,"Corporate bonds or treasury bonds? There's no risk of treasuries being revealed to be a bunch of Venezuelan bonds in a trench coat, like with MBS."
2021-04-10 18:02:03,stocks,I don't think that's just an opinion.  Their target is 2% and if they've also expressed a desire to let it run a bit hot in order to make up for averages below 2% in the recent past.  Maybe not up to 4% but I think they've hinted at 2.5% or so.
2021-04-10 13:17:29,stocks,"Another strategy might be to stay 100% invested, and when we get a big pullback lever up your portfolio - go to 150% or 200% stocks. To get there you could sell stock and buy deep ITM LEAPs instead. The rate to ""borrow"" money to lever up this way can be less than 1%."
2021-04-10 08:21:07,stocks,"Thanks for your reply :)

At what percentage of your position being down would you say is a good time to average down? For me, I’ll average down sometimes when it’s just 5% down, but I feel like it’s too little of a drop."
2021-04-10 08:39:43,stocks,"This. We've been hitting ATHs since May 2013. If you were scared of hitting ATHs then, you wouldve missed out on over doubling what you have, just from SPY alone. The best thing you can do is set an amount you want to deposit each week/month, and stick with that. You get to catch any downturns, and add while the stock goes up."
2021-04-10 18:34:17,stocks,Really?  I thought you bough high and sold low.
2021-04-10 18:57:11,stocks,"Thanks for your reply :)

So, big money probs will move money from stocks to bonds when the bonds come back up in value?"
2021-04-10 12:25:40,stocks,What’s a good source or reading for finding more out about what happened with Michael Burry and the SEC? Can you recommend something? Thanks.
2021-04-10 12:21:22,stocks,"SEC now issuing gag orders for people just telling the truth?  Gee, and I thought they were supposed to just combat market manipulation or something, not help maintain an ample supply of bagholders for the rich at all times.

To paraphrase Elon, might as well rename SEC to ""Suck Establishment's Cock""."
2021-04-10 08:12:05,stocks,"So in other words, nothing to really be worried about?"
2021-04-10 08:18:01,stocks,"Thanks for this insight :)

So, because the news at the moment is kind of negative, we shouldn’t really be very concerned about anything assuming the trend follows?"
2021-04-10 18:36:24,stocks,"I have similar fears, but no idea how to protect against it.  What's a sensible defensive strategy?"
2021-04-10 14:33:33,stocks,"Anybody can say there is a ""crash coming"" and be right eventually."
2021-04-10 10:56:33,stocks,I hope the market crashes after I finish my degree and get a job. I do not want to experience a recession upon graduation lmao
2021-04-10 18:29:08,stocks,"So where do you get that excess equity, rob a bank?  Because why the fuck are you having cash lying around doing nothing now?"
2021-04-10 10:33:30,stocks,"So the higher it is, the more likely a crash?

And where do I find this pls :)"
2021-04-10 08:11:36,stocks,"Absolutely, that’s the exciting part.

I’m trying to keep a decent cash reserve hopefully, what percentage would you suggest?"
2021-04-10 14:13:04,stocks,"False.  No one has a crystal ball, but we do have statistics.  My favourite indicator of a crash is the Buffett Indicator, which takes aggregate market price, and compares it to GDP.  It essentially tells us how overvalued the stock market is.  This indicator predicted the Dot Com crash of 2000, and right now, it's higher than it was during 2000.  There will be a market crash, I guarantee.  Things can't keep going up like this without a crash happening at some point."
2021-04-10 14:53:17,stocks,"> I would worry about the US Treasury Market and what's going on there.....there is some funny business going on

*Citadel and Palafox (and their entirely rehypothecated shorted treasury repo markets in Cayman islands) have left the chat.*"
2021-04-10 18:03:27,stocks,">combined with the Wall Street bailouts causing the ""Great Recession"".

This is absolutley incorrect.  The Wall Street bailouts didn't cause the Great Recession.  If anything, they actually prevented the Great Recession from becoming The Greatest Depression Imaginable.

(My name for it.)"
2021-04-10 13:00:21,stocks,"also in deflationary periods (we are at historically low interest rates), people tend to take on lots of debt. interest rates have to rise at some point which means that those leveraged positions become much more expensive to hold, which attracts institutions to start deleveraging some of their positions"
2021-04-10 12:49:15,stocks,This is its own kind of loss porn lol
2021-04-10 14:58:24,stocks,"tell us when you finally buy, that will be the top"
2021-04-10 18:41:01,stocks,"You weren't wrong, based on fundamentals - but the market is crooked and the game is rigged."
2021-04-10 10:04:13,stocks,"So in other words, this constant cycle of spend, print, repeat is putting immense pressure on the market, which will eventually crash it?

The US has had a big debt burden for years, why would a crash happen now?"
2021-04-10 11:51:39,stocks,"A couple of corrections:
The fed is the sole issuer of US dollars and will never default on its debt unless politicians vote to do so. 
Government spending is not like a household and need not be ‘balanced’. This deficit spending is literally the origin of all of the dollars in all of our bank accounts. 
Also, I believe you meant 26T debt, not deficit."
2021-04-10 10:01:38,stocks,"I think the market condition is much more different to 1929.

There’s a lot more investors; people will be much more snappy to take a discount, so I think the recovery will be much quicker than 1929.

Just look at what happened with COVID-19, probably one of the biggest events that shocked the stock market in recent history, and we’ve already recovered"
2021-04-10 10:18:46,stocks,"The only way a crash similar to 1929 with that long of a recovery happens if there is a international technological reset, I’m talking a global EMP. In the case that happens, you’ll have more to worry about that your stonks being down. It’s not comparable in the slightest."
2021-04-10 11:19:36,stocks,"He sold GME at like $17, so I can't take him serious anymore."
2021-04-10 13:05:58,stocks,So next week? The indices are almost there now.
2021-04-10 11:21:28,stocks,"The market crash in feb 2020 wasn't because of some aggregate knowledge of the market.  It was because of COVID, so unless his model accounts for a virus unknown to the general public, that was coincidental."
2021-04-10 10:47:05,stocks,"Thanks for your reply :)

How did he calculate that, and how do we know it’s accurate?"
2021-04-10 11:53:19,stocks,"I’m curious what you mean by “central banks will be the absolute winners,” could you elaborate?"
2021-04-10 15:09:56,stocks,Yeh tell that to the people who dumped their savings into ARKK in the beginning of February.

2021-04-10 12:50:13,stocks,"That's well said. But the difference I feel is you entered/invested at the best time. Any money invested last year would have at least 20%+ gains unless someone didn't know absolutely anything he was doing. And for someone who wants to enter the market now, looking at all the gains people have made past year, and thinking they'll be making at least 15-20%+ this year are bound to get dissappointed. Even the ETFs are close to all time high. I think the best thing to do right now is invest 50% of the sum you're planning to invest assuming it won't make any returns and then after waiting for a couple of months either average up or average down on the stocks/etfs you have your sight on."
2021-04-10 11:06:24,stocks,"Exactly! I remember last April when I wanted to put money in the market everyone was saying that there will be a second wave and this is just a small rebound but everything will melt down. How can’t it… Look at this virus and what it will do to the world… Fortunately I did not listen to the haters and have made plenty of money. 

In the end, putting money into the market is a risk, but a risk we should all be willing to take imho."
2021-04-10 14:58:06,stocks,"I've never had any luck on puts, even when I'm right. If you think the market's gonna take, just be more conservative in your picks and hold more cash then wait to buy at the bottom."
2021-04-10 12:01:19,stocks,"Yeah, this is exactly what all these subs were like at this same time last year. We got wrecked in March, there was a bit of a recovery going into April, and then all you saw on reddit was the impending market crash is coming. From then until Jan of this year I had by far the biggest year of gains I've ever had in the market."
2021-04-10 18:13:41,stocks,"So you calculate your returns based upon the market low point?

You should calculate your returns based upon when you bought them and then you can average the returns for comparison purposes."
2021-04-10 13:14:57,stocks,Sounds like you got greedy you had all of March to bargain shop.
2021-04-10 18:12:54,stocks,But 12 red candles are fine? Everyone spazzing Apple is soaring!! Soaring? It’s 3 bucks less than it was 7 god damn months ago and was down 15% from January. All it’s doing is getting back to even. Yippee
2021-04-10 12:00:44,stocks,Where have you been for the last month or so?
2021-04-10 12:55:57,stocks,"You completely just ignored March lol, red candles for days"
2021-04-10 11:39:05,stocks,Which stock do you mean specifically?
2021-04-10 18:21:41,stocks,You think the market can't just stay flat for a while?  You might want to look at the S&P graph of the last 20 years.
2021-04-10 18:27:03,stocks,"2013 is when I started getting frustrated, so much good news for so long and no irrational exuberance to show for it.  It was just like the market was slowly and slowly going up in real time without all of the wild swings.  Good for economy, but fucking BORING."
2021-04-10 14:28:07,stocks,"Good point! And to OP’s comment, it’s not exactly a total *crash* we’re fearing: it’s a “normal” *correction* or minor recession (even that feels superfluous)."
2021-04-10 13:01:52,stocks,We been on a 10 year bull run
2021-04-10 17:29:59,stocks,I would argue because of speed of recovery that may not be a true bear market. Stocks were pretty overvalued before Covid and raced up right after.
2021-04-10 18:50:26,stocks,"I would consider this to still be a part of the decade+ long bull run. I think the covid crash wasn’t really a proper bear market, and it’s barely visible on the 30 year chart."
2021-04-10 19:44:55,stocks,But we were in a bull run already before covid then went through a correction for a month lol before continuing upwards?
2021-04-10 18:14:25,stocks,Seriously. And that bull run was just to make up for the 30% we lost from the shutdown. So sick of hearing about a 12 year bull run. 2018 was no god damn bull run that’s for sure.
2021-04-10 10:26:59,stocks,Those were not bear markets. Not even close.
2021-04-10 12:22:50,stocks,"How would you define ""crash""? In 2000 it took 7 years for the market to recover. 2008 it took 4.5 years. Compared to those, 2020 taking 6 months to recover is a blip/quarterly dip. On the max time sp chart, 2020 dip doesn't even show up lol"
2021-04-10 11:19:10,stocks,"Many new investors were born in the 80s or 90s, maybe even the first 2 years of 00s. Those of us who were born in the 80s remember hearing about the crash of 87, the crash of 2000, 2007-2009, 2018 and 2020. Markets always go up. Sometimes they go down, just to go back up higher."
2021-04-10 15:33:21,stocks,Do you have a good source?
2021-04-10 15:35:35,stocks,"A lot of companies have goosed EPS by borrowing money and buying back shares to reduce the denominator in the EPS calculation. Many companies are pretty reliant on continually rolling debt to pay for capex as well. A 2% hike in rates could really do a number on earnings. But then again, where else is all this cash that has fallen from the sky going to wind up?"
2021-04-10 13:31:10,stocks,Yep
2021-04-10 18:05:10,stocks,Fixed income fucking bubble?  WTF are you talking about?  The only thing that would bust bonds is a wave of defaults.  That is extremely unlikely with the US government pumping up the economy.

2021-04-10 08:39:19,stocks,"I believe he's implying to be prudent, knowing the company, it's intrinsic value and applying a margin of safety would be best steps to take. Buying on 5% dips, isn't ideal, if a stock can move down during a bear market. Patience does pay off in the long term, if you average down (say 30%-50%) at great prices. This kind of business/economic environment cannot last forever and there will be more opportunities in the future to establish new positions."
2021-04-10 08:43:20,stocks,"Actually this isn't the best of ideas. If I'm not mistaken, studies have shown you're better off with all your money invested, and even better off using margin. Obviously, with using margin, comes big risks, but you probably shouldn't hold money on the side for that 1 in a million chance of the market crashing tomorrow."
2021-04-10 11:15:29,stocks,"From CNBC:

“Looking at data going back to 1930, Bank of America found that if an investor missed the S&P 500's 10 best days in each  decade, total returns would be just 91%, significantly below the 14,962% return for investors who held steady through the downturns.”

2021-04-10 08:18:43,stocks,Basically you must be confident and cautious.
2021-04-10 09:16:31,stocks,I would add that any week your could probably google 'market crash soon?' or 'upcoming correction' and find several articles from just that week. The truth is no one knows.
2021-04-10 12:17:10,stocks,"If you believe the crash is coming, you can stay in the market for now, but bow out when the first day of big market drop. It tends to be a better strategy because you wouldn’t miss out on the market gain that can go on for much of 2021, but your loss will be limited with circuit breakers and such."
2021-04-10 08:18:53,stocks,"Yes, if the trend holds"
2021-04-10 15:16:28,stocks,Aren't all the previous crashes from negative news? The media controls the stock market.
2021-04-10 14:48:11,stocks,"All we can do is formulate an opinion based off of the research we conduct. If you don’t do the research, (which anyone who has would say the same as myself), you won’t see it coming. This isn’t just any normal crash coming.. this could break the global, not just US, financial system. We’re talking the US dollar (global reserve currency) collapsing."
2021-04-10 12:45:19,stocks,"It's easy for people to say ""just buy the crash"" when the job market is good and they're not struggling financially. The reason most people don't get to buy in at the bottom of a recession is because their personal finances are so borked that they can't invest."
2021-04-10 18:30:26,stocks,"Don't worry, you won't get a job if there is a recession and you just graduated, but you can always sell blood to raise equity."

2021-04-10 12:16:16,stocks,"So, hear me out, if the budget doesn’t need to be balanced and there are no plans to then just print 100 trillion and distribute that to everyone’s bank account.

No one should be without a Ferrari at least a mansion and personal doctors in home. Inflation will still be <2% the way it is currently calculated and all household debt will be paid off. The government carry’s the burden of all debt and they don’t have to worry about it."

You're looking at a crystal ball and saying, ""Hey, this is where the market should be at and because it recovered so fast, a crash should be right around the corner"".

If anything, the speed of recovery speaks to the resilience of the US economy + its policies.

That's not to say that the stimulus has really thrown a wrench at things. Inflation is coming even if the fed denies it. If you don't have your money in assets, you're kinda boned."

Stimulus, inflation, USD devaluation, no where is safe to put your money aside from assets. If you're still holding on cash, your money is just losing purchasing power day by day. People need a place to dump money and the stock market is just a place to do that.

You will never know 100% what'a going to happen so if you have the cash, best invest it. No one has ever lost out by putting money into the stock market consistently over the long term."

2021-04-10 08:27:53,stocks,Short sellers? Are you referring to a particular stock or the market as a whole?
2021-04-10 19:22:20,stocks,"Yeah, exactly.  Back in 2000, the reason for the crash was because a lot of overvalued internet companies were surging through the market.  Faith investors were dumping loads of money into them, thinking they'd one day be profitable.  People lost faith in these companies as they continued to lose money, and people began to pull money out, which caused the crash.  

Priceline.com was an example of one of those companies.  Originally, they were a company set to take unsold airline tickets, and sell them to consumers for cheaper.  Airlines would sell seats that would normally be empty, consumers would get cheaper tickets, and Priceline would make money from being the 3rd party.  Seemed like a great business, but it wasn't.  They aggressively expanded into other markets, put a lot of money into advertisements, and lost substantial amounts of money year after year.  It seemed like a very good thing to invest in, especially because they held a monopoly of sorts, but the thing is, even if you're a monopoly, you have to be able to profit eventually.  If you can't, you go under.

There are a lot of companies today that remind me of priceline.com, and I have a feeling we could see a crash very similar to 2000.  Uber, Lyft, Air B&B and a ton of other services are suffering net losses, year after year.  They hold monopoly positions, but still can't profit.  What'll that mean to the future of the company if it can't ever make profit?  Bankruptcy.  My personal prediction is that Air B&B will go bankrupt at some point in time in the near future.  As that happens, people investing in these net loss monopolies will begin to pull out their money, which then could lead to a market crash just like 2000.  Just my prediction, and likely won't happen that way, but if it does, you can call me Warren."

2021-04-10 13:16:48,stocks,"Yes, ignore the Covid “crash” because it “corrected” completely in a matter of months, only because the fed injected billions of dollars. We’re propped up on printed money, and a handful of companies are the majority of the market.  How is any of that sustainable?"

When you bust your ass to create a portfolio of solid winners but nothing happens right away and you have to wait weeks, months, or even year's for any meaningful growth not because you choose bad companies but because everyone is being cautious and sitting on cash and bonds, then you'll know what a bear market is."
2021-04-10 11:05:16,stocks,"If you go by what you can see in Google, I don't think SPX hit bear market territory in 2018 in closing prices. It was close, but just missed (the Nasdaq however, yes, it did, and then it proceeded to jump 30% or so after that very quickly).

2020 on the other hand...yes. All of the averages entered bear market territory and then the Fed stepped in.

I think the old school likely need to adjust the way they see things btw. Don't think there's a world that exists anymore where you can get a 50%+ haircut in the S&P that takes 10-11 months. If it happens again it's going to in half the time most likely."

You are trying to define bear market in your view but the great thing is we have defined metrics for this created already and is used as a standard for interpretation the word bear market means nothing more than -20% from ATH but you are trying to add context to create a narrative.

Your entire argument is bull market lasting a long time so you assume an equivalent length of a bear market would appear. But none of these are related statistically. Prior bull markets have no determination on how a bear market will operate a bear market has no determination on how a bull market operates.

Long story short, I think Moderna has a lot more room for growth, and I think that the new mRNA technology is the next big thing when it comes to treatment of diseases; the COVID-19 vaccine is a great sign of that. PFE is in no way a bad pick though.

Yea that's kind of my thoughts as well, though I worry for Moderna - is Pfizer able to catch up with mRNA? I mean... they're deploying shots. Is there a worry that they'll be able to compete strongly with Moderna with this technology?

I looked at JnJ too. Just worried about valuation versus, say, Pfizer. Lower dividend and higher P/B (but I'm certainly open-minded)."

It’s not just drugs, walk down the aisle at target and you’ll realize just how much they have their hand in consumer medical products. Multiple revenue streams is very attractive, and the same reason a sizable chunk of my portfolio is Disney. 

Admittedly I do not know much in the way of drugs or drug trials. I read up what I can, but I’m an accountant not an immunologist. I like having the peace of mind that even if drug trials fail or for instance the efficacy of their vaccine is called into question, there is risk mitigation in place simply by the structure of the company. Ship may list from time to time, but it’s not going to sink."

I’m currently rebalancing my portfolio a bit, but I intend to give Pfizer a bigger proportion than Moderna (just a slight bit), because Moderna is still quite new.

2021-04-10 07:45:37,stocks,"> I think PFE is behind the game when it comes to mRNA.

Why's that? 

I'm wondering if the fact that they pulled out an mRNA vaccine so quickly would be compelling to go with them over Moderna? Not to say both wouldn't be strong businesses (and clearly you think this is likely to be true given the investment in both) - but Johnson & Johnson went the traditional route, Moderna was first with the mRNA vaccine, but Pfizer is right there with them."
2021-04-10 08:46:39,stocks,JNJ is not only pharmaceuticals but also consumer goods. Diversify.
2021-04-10 08:05:35,stocks,"Reason why is because Pfizer has close to nothing in their pipeline relating to mRNA, so with the exception of the COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer doesn’t seem to be actively developing anything right now that is mRNA based.

Moderna? Well, their ticker symbol is literally MRNA😂

They’re focused on it. It’s just the slight concern that the technology and the company itself is still quite new as to why I have given MRNA slightly less weight than PFE."
2021-04-10 08:09:19,stocks,"Gotcha. I'm with you I'm just asking to see what others think. I appreciate your thoughts!

Don't feel like this is a challenge or anything - but how could I learn more about the pipeline drugs that Moderna has coming up? I do like the mRNA technology development. Nice potential."

2021-04-10 00:00:00,stocks,"Corona virus/ COVID-19 vaccine candidate ExpreS2ion $EXPRS2 Coronavirus/COVID-19

ExpreS2ion and its joint venture partner AdaptVac are engaged in the development of a unique capsid virus-like particle (cVLP) COVID-19 vaccine, partly sponsored through a [***Horizon 2020 EU grant award***](https://news.cision.com/expres2ion-biotechnologies/r/expres2ion-announces-eu-grant-award-for-the-covid-19-vaccine-development-programme,c3054055) to the PREVENT-nCoV consortium to rapidly advance the vaccine candidate against COVID-19 into the clinical stage. The candidate vaccine is a cVLP applying ExpreS2-produced SARS-CoV-2 antigens, thereby creating a powerful immunogenic vaccine.

AdaptVac and [***AGC Biologics***](http://www.agcbio.com/), a global Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) for biopharmaceuticals have entered into a partnership for the scale-up and cGMP manufacture of the COVID-19 vaccine. In July 2020, AdaptVac and [***Bavarian Nordic***](https://www.bavarian-nordic.com/), a fully integrated biotechnology company focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of life-saving vaccines, have entered into a license agreement which provides Bavarian Nordic the global commercialization rights to the proprietary capsid virus like particle (cVLP) based SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine, designated ABNCoV2. For application of our proprietary protein production system ExpreS2, ExpreS2ion and AdaptVac have also entered into a license agreement for this project.

In addition to ExpreS2ion and AdaptVac, the PREVENT-nCoV consortium members are Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), Institute for Tropical Medicine (ITM) at University of Tübingen, The Department of Immunology and Microbiology (ISIM) at University of Copenhagen, the Laboratory of Virology at Wageningen University, and Radboud University Medical Center. The first clinical Phase I/II study was initiated in March 2021.

### Breast cancer

Breast cancer is a widespread oncology indication affecting more than 1.3 million people worldwide annually, resulting in more than 450,000 deaths (Tao, 2015: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25543329). The most common treatment today is based on monoclonal antibodies, where the dominating therapy Herceptin (trastuzumab) generates annual global sales of USD 7 billion. The target product profile of AdaptVac's lead breast cancer project, AV001(HER2-cVLP), is tailored to be highly competitive both in terms of cost and efficacy, thus aiming at a significant market share.

In February 2021, ExpreS2ion signed a final patent license agreement with AdaptVac whereby ExpreS2ion exclusively licensed in AV001 (renamed ES2B-C001). This gives ExpreS2ion full control over and responsibility for driving this valuable asset forward, hereby realising the very significant value of this project.

**DESCRIPTION**

Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that designs, develops & manufactures hardware & software solutions for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for corporate, public, & residential customers. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.

**History**

In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network.

$CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in the US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K L2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are ""non-networked"", carving \~53% market share of ""networked"" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of L3 'Superchargers', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \~22% of the market pie, L2 \~75% and L1, \~3% of market share. People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 & L2. Well, that's wrong. L3 is obviously the option for the highways, commercial and service transportation. Even larger segment though is found at: parking lots, restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas, malls, corporate offices and other mass conglomerations. This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install, but with longer charging times - perfect fit.

**Products**

Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers - Solutions for every use case, all vehicle types and brands - High efficiency in power and footprint - Modular, scalable, secure architecture designed for serviceability- Unparalleled quality; advanced testing (vehicle, functional, climate, environment) for long-term reliability - Options for site hosts to use custom branding

**Software Enables** \- Control of who can use stations and when - All vehicles to get charged on time - Multiple vehicles to share power - Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied- Roaming integrations with other charging networks

**Challengers**

* $VLTA; Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better ""engagement"" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s & 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it*.
* SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).
* $EVGO; EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (\~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus.
* $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:*""The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.""*
* $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.

**Near Term Catalysts**

In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: ""AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.""

It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration.

That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.

**Long Term Catalysts**

\- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.

$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.

**Miscellaneous**

$CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6.

$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.

$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.

In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.

No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.

Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st.

**MOAT**

* First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)
* Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)
* Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)
* Network Effect ( \~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)

**CONCLUSION**

All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in ESG friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology

**Why am I interested in $CHPT?**

Because it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry.

Because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home ""GAS station"".

Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum, + ESG and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations.

A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what.

This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - bananas.

2021-04-10 09:19:52,stocks," I just want to point out something you might not have considered for the industry as a whole. Consider Norway, they are way ahead of the world if we look at EV usage per capita. The problem they are facing currently and also many European countries like the Netherlands and Germany is that the power grid is not made for mass consumption, all these countries need to invest in their power grid to prevent future failure. Who is going to guarantee these much needed upgrades will be done in the future when it is needed? Lack of these investments can stop these companies in their growth.

Are the short sellers fools or is there any basis to their positions?  What would you say is the strongest part of their business that may be overlooked?"

Current anti-trust legislation is going to be very hard to apply. You have to prove the consumer was negatively affected by behavior, just look at examples like Standard Oil jacking up prices etc. You don’t have that here. Google is free to use. FB is free, Instagram is free. Sure they show you ads but the actual price of the good or service upfront is nothing. You could argue google search has benefited consumers. Not to mention, regulators approved of the acquisitions those companies made back in the day. By trying to retroactively punish mega cap, they’re basically saying they’re punishing success and want to put a ceiling on it. 

That isn’t to say that competition isn’t hurt. But standard definitions of anti-trust really don’t fit. There isn’t just one social network there are plenty and you could join at any time. Use duck duck go or bing or yahoo for your search engine if you want. Nothing is stopping you, right?"

There is a small possibility a state government might eventually pass a law that has real impact but expect that to take at least two more years.

2021-04-10 00:00:00,stocks,"Mastech Digital (MHH), value stock in the current market Mastech Digital is a high level IT staffing and Data management/analytics firm.  Its market cap is $200m making it a micro/small cap firm.  I think that it is on the cusp of big things.

**FCF CAGR:**  53.4% over 10 growth periods, 31.3% @ 7yrs,  and 111.3% @ 3 years.  **BVPS CAGR** at 10, 7, 3 years is 14.6%, 24.7%, and 28% respectively.  **EPS** is 28.1%, 9.5%, and 73.1% over those growth periods.  **Revenue Growth Rate** is 10.5%, 8.9%, and 9.5%.  **Return on Equity** (ROE) grew at 11.5% compounded over 10 years and 40.4% over the last 3 years.  At the 7 year mark ROE spiked because the company bought back over 600K shares.  That skews the ROE CAGR for that time span.  Its Long-Term Debt to Earnings sits at value of 1.35, and its ROIC is 0.35.  Yahoo Finance has analysts predictions of 18% annual growth over the next five years.

Mastech Digital did have a flat year in 2020 due to Covid-19.  Their revenue growth was flat YoY from 2019 and they did miss their EPS by $0.03.  This has lead to the stock trading between $16.00 to $18.00 per share so far this year.

Two discounted calcs that I ran with a 15% compounded rate of return on the company put its current value between $32.00 to $44.00.  Factor in a huge Margin of Safety and that puts my buy range between $16.00 - $22.00.

Mastech Digital is a minority owned business and I recall reading it has a higher than average number of women in its senior positions (although as of this posting I cannot find my source on that second piece).

2020 was an incredibly tough year for many businesses.  Staffing agencies suffered across most if not all sectors.  Despite this, Mastech Digital's financials, while down, were not terrible compared YoY and their overall profit margin increased.  This suggests to me that their cost controls allow them to absorb significant economic down turns, and they can compete effectively in their market from a pricing standpoint.  There is a marketable advantage in that the company is minority owned and they recognize the value of women in upper management roles.  As 2021 shows an economy that is ramping up I believe demand for highly skilled IT staff is going to explode.  Companies that put off data management and data analytics consulting will move forward with those plans.  Mastech Digital is going to have an amazing year, and I'm excited to own a piece of the company.

I put about 6% of my non-retirement portfolio into this company and I'm thinking of putting in a little bit more.  I would love to hear your feedback.

2021-04-10 02:32:40,stocks,"My guess would be that a tiny margin scares investors a little bit. It seems that most of the shares are owned by insiders and at 2M profit per quarter, one executive could sell enough shares to wipe out quarterly profits.

2021-04-10 03:44:50,stocks,"That is an interesting point.  I'll confess I'm a little confused as to how a management member selling their shares would effect quarterly profits?  It's an aspect that I'm not up to speed on yet.

/Edit/
I think you are speaking to a manager exercising a large amount of options and how the expense is then accounted for by the company.

Options are something I haven't fully grasped and I've been focusing my attention elsewhere until I'm ready to dive into learning more about them."
2021-04-10 14:53:52,stocks,"You are right, I misspoke. The company might have shares available already and don't have to buy them on the market when someone exercise options or a shares grant. I wasn't thinking clearly when I wrote that post."

I don't think management compensation in the form of options is a true threat to MHH's quarterly profits.  Something would have to dramatically and drastically change for that to factor in.  I'd put forth the argument that the fundamentals over 10yrs and 3yrs are too strong currently.

If this guy invested 10k and never logged in again to check it, assuming it’s not an ira probably 100% chance it’s with the state.

More likely than not, someone is lying about this story anyways."

2021-04-10 00:00:00,stocks,"How does an IPO of a company affect prices of other stocks and how does it impact the overall stock market? Heylo fellow Redditors! I am new to stock markets in general and have been reading about a lot of IPOs and potential ones, and made me wonder how can popular (or otherwise) IPOs affect the stock market and buying/selling behaviour.

Is there any indicator that can help me buy or sell stocks (not necessarily for the company that is going for an IPO) around the time of an IPO to get a boost on profits?"
2021-04-10 00:28:55,stocks,"I think you’re trying to be too cute in your strategy, IPO’s vary drastically between public offering methods, sector, and just general timing."
2021-04-10 01:45:14,stocks,It doesn't
2021-04-10 02:26:00,stocks,"Not sure how exactly an IPO affects *another company* at least in any direct way, but IPO frequency tends to increase in manic or overenthusiastic markets. Some relative peaks in IPOs since the 90s are 1999 (486), 2000 (429), 2004 (268), 2007 (299), 2014 (258), 2020 (450), and 2021 (387). Note severe pullbacks in the market in 2000-2002 and 2007-2008, and brief cessations of bullish conditions after 2004 and 2014.

All this is to say that the market tends to have a point at which the exuberance ends, and there's a return to reality (downturn) thereafter. But while the market is hyped up, IPOs tend to become more frequent. 

**Why?** Because companies can enter the frenzied market to exchange shares of their company *for capital*. As enthusiasm in the market soars, investors and speculators, old and new, flock to all sorts of securities. As people seek out larger and larger returns, they must often seek out riskier and riskier investment opportunities. Where else better to find these than in a brand new ticker (IPO/SPAC)? What if you buy 1000 shares of some new unheard-of EV company at $10 each and it rockets to $800 in 10 years? It only makes sense that if you want people to buy up your company at high value, then you should wait for the market to be one in which everyone and their mother is throwing money in.

**Can you see how this could be problematic?** While legitimate companies could no doubt enter the market at any time at their discretion, ill-fated, unscrupulous, and/or fraudulent companies can also enter the market *to take advantage of the frenzy*. These companies can rope in willful buyers, ""This EV stock will be worth a fortune in 5 years!"", ""Millionaire investor reveals his pick to overtake Tesla,"" ""Own this solar stock and retire by 2030,"" etc., etc.. These companies might even get pulled into risky funds or ETFs, exposing them to the inevitable downside when such companies are later exposed as unprofitable. When those specific markets crater, they can drag the whole market down with them."
2021-04-10 02:47:35,stocks,"I'm not going to answer your question but a different one.

As you may have noticed, SPACs have become all the rage.

You may have also noticed that a lot of them have gone public over the last year.

When so many companies become public, they take investible dollars away from other companies. 

So indirectly they create competiton for capital.

But if you're looking at one stock vs another IPO that will impact it, there are a lot of possible situations. So I don't think you can create broad stokes in answering it."
2021-04-10 15:08:23,stocks,"It's simple supply and demand, some of these big unicorn IPOs will absolutely affect the larger market because many investors will take and cash in their gains from FAANG, which are the top stocks owned by many funds, and invest into these new issues of IPOs. They create an oversupply of stock and, like a previous poster said, compete for investor capital."
2021-04-10 00:57:58,stocks,"I understand that those are influencing factors, but I’m looking for trends or any indication of potential volatility in the market.

I get why you think it’s a strategy (I’ve typed it that way) that I’m going for.

Just to be clear, it’s something that I’d like to understand to add it to my strategy and not make it my strategy. If IPOs shake the market enough to make it pretty volatile for a while then it’s a good idea to be on that wave and make extra bucks that I could reinvest in other stocks

If you still think this is a flawed approach then please help me correct it, I’m open to constructive criticism :)"
2021-04-10 01:45:48,stocks,"Okay, thanks :)"
2021-04-10 02:33:40,stocks,"Thank you so much, this really helps :)"
2021-04-10 11:17:21,stocks,"I don’t think IPO’s have that systemic of an effect. There are multiple IPO’s almost daily and most fly under the radar, and that’s not even including SPAC’s. Money isn’t infinite, so if there’s a hyped IPO like COIN or something then other stocks may be sold to raise cash to buy. Another time where there’s an effect is let’s say COIN went public then a bit later Gemini went public, you may see shares of COIN react negatively to that. It’s just hard to predict though which is why if you’re just trying to make a few extra bucks doing this it’s likely not worth it. Not to mention I’m not a fan of short term trades in general."
2021-04-10 00:00:00,stocks,"VOO or VTI for the next 30 years? Knowing that VOO has had slightly better returns than VTI past 10 years, which ETF would you rather invest in? This is something that I have been pondering on. I understand the differences have been almost negligible but as investors, we want the best returns possible. What do you guys think?"
2021-04-10 00:24:09,stocks,Vti is total market so unless you know mega cap tech is going to continue to dominate (and propel the sp500 ahead as a subset of vti) then you know the answer.
2021-04-10 02:09:39,stocks,"You could split vti in to mega, large, mid, small, international and have more control over weighting but still basically hold VTI, including voo."
2021-04-10 03:28:04,stocks,I’m VTI
2021-04-10 13:00:39,stocks,I don't understand where this idea that VOO/SPY outperforms VTI/total US equities market comes from. This isn't the first time I've read it here. Total stock market beats SP500 over the last 10 years. If you use VTSAX compared to SP500 index from 2000+ it's an even larger gap of over +40%.
2021-04-10 07:03:17,stocks,The past 10 years performance may not be an indicator for the next 30 years performance.
2021-04-10 00:25:39,stocks,VTI
2021-04-10 05:01:06,stocks,I prefer VOO/VXF combo over VTI
2021-04-10 08:01:10,stocks,"I’m VOO, VTI, and my favorite VUG.

Just balance the whole $h1t to play it safe."
2021-04-10 10:10:30,stocks,"VOO + VXF wins the day imo.  VTI, while good as a one fund, the mid-small caps only make up 15% of the total fund which is not factored enough to take advantage."
2021-04-10 10:18:02,stocks,Not the next 30 years but forever
2021-04-10 00:40:38,stocks,I hate when people automatically say VTI. Look at a comparison of the two’s returns over the last few decades and let that be the decision making factor. I normally split between SPY and a growth fund. Just my opinion.
2021-04-10 00:52:00,stocks,VOO and DIA
2021-04-10 13:00:10,stocks,I prefer majority VOO with a small or micro cap growth fund supplementing.
2021-04-10 01:23:04,stocks,Reasons I would choose VTI is that they hold companies that blow up yet aren’t in the s&p500 yet such as square and Tesla (it’s in s&p500 bow AFTER explosive run up).
2021-04-10 08:18:55,stocks,"To extend on this VT is the world market, so unless you know US is going to dominate then you should do VT over VTI"
2021-04-10 02:27:12,stocks,Should I hold both VTI and VOO? Would it be bad to go 100% VTI?
2021-04-10 03:39:11,stocks,Me too. VTI had Tesla way before VOO.
2021-04-10 13:10:03,stocks,Where did you see this?
2021-04-10 13:02:44,stocks,So VTI could beat VOO?
2021-04-10 00:28:15,stocks,Why over VOO?
2021-04-10 13:02:06,stocks,"I am holding VTI, arkk, arkg, and qqqj."
2021-04-10 13:04:15,stocks,Well how much is allocated into voo and vxf for you?
2021-04-10 00:42:53,stocks,Growth fund as in small cap?
2021-04-10 14:04:55,stocks,Well they’ve tracked extremely similar the last two decades and regardless of that the past will not decide how the future performs
2021-04-10 05:57:19,stocks,Aren’t the companies in DIA all in VOO anyway? Why invest more in those specific companies?
2021-04-10 14:27:08,stocks,They also hold many losers. Dilutes the gains of the few companies with big run ups.
2021-04-10 03:29:45,stocks,"Do you like mid cap and small cap exposure? If so, do more VTI. If not, do more VOO. Only picking one is fine. It’s not a huge difference."
2021-04-10 11:54:42,stocks,"No it wouldn't be bad, just dilutive. A total market index dilutes both gains and losses. My suggestion is intended if you want more control over the weighting at certain times to capitalize on sector rotations, or unique growth opportunities. 

Personally, I don't have much in VTI, except a chunk of 401k. I have no issues monitoring my investments though which is another important point. If you don't have the time/energy/know how to keep up with the market VTI or equivalent is the best way to go."
2021-04-10 16:12:26,stocks,"I don't know about the 40% outperformance that the person above claims but yes, total market always beats S&P500 over [long periods of time.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/fund-performance?s=y&symbol=VTI&symbols=SPY). [Small-cap value beats all.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/fund-performance?s=y&symbol=VTI&symbols=SPY&benchmark=DFSVX)

There's also this thing called ""academic literature"" and ""research"" that explains why."
2021-04-10 00:53:06,stocks,"I will add my 2c here.

VTI includes all companies listed on NYSE and NASDAQ in order to emulate the CRSP US Total Market index while VOO tries to emulate the S&P 500 index which has fewer stocks.

So, VOO gives you exposure to primarily large cap stocks while VTI gives you exposure to large, mid, small and micro cap stocks. The non-large cap stocks can have better returns under certain market conditions. In theory, by widening the base, your risk mitigation should also get better.

Not only does this give you wider exposure but also gives you ownership of rising stars that do not (yet) meet the minimum requirements to be included in the S&P 500. So, VTI included Tesla once it started being publicly traded while VOO only got it once it was included in the S&P 500.

That said, roughly 70% of VTI holdings are also found in VOO IIRC."
2021-04-10 13:05:41,stocks,My current allocation is about 40 VOO / 30 VXF
2021-04-10 00:54:36,stocks,Nah so I’m personally in SCHG and other individuals  use VUG. Similar to SP500 but more growth/TECH concentrated.
2021-04-10 10:39:00,stocks,"It’s ok to invest more on blue chip companies, that are in DIA."
2021-04-10 14:45:58,stocks,Ehh.. every loser there is a Tesla and square that go up 1000%. That will always beat a loser that goes down 100%. There is not limit to an up but there is to a down.
2021-04-10 03:40:20,stocks,The only reason why I gravitate towards VTI is because they held Tesla way before VOO and I think that says something in a good way. Also holds square and other promising growth companies.
2021-04-10 01:03:25,stocks,I heard it’s more like 82%
2021-04-10 13:09:31,stocks,Oh wow so you want to be heavy with smaller caps?
2021-04-10 17:13:16,stocks,"VXF looks interesting. Curious, what is your other 30% in, single stocks?"
2021-04-10 10:49:16,stocks,"Yeah it’s definitely ok, I just don’t expect it to give any better returns than VOO"
2021-04-10 17:11:19,stocks,"This is true.

 But my guess is (and I could be totally wrong), that there are significantly more losers than those that fly to the moon. The sum of those losses MAY be greater than the ones who do well."
2021-04-10 03:43:35,stocks,"Why not just pick one and then pick a growth or tech ETF? It seems like what you are looking for. Maybe a small cap ETF. 

Vanguard ETFs are all so tasty. Pick your flavor."
2021-04-10 01:04:50,stocks,Possible. I haven’t checked this in sometime. The basic idea there is there’s a big overlap between the holdings of the two funds.
2021-04-10 07:29:51,stocks,Try this: [https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php](https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php)
2021-04-10 13:20:24,stocks,"Correct.  I do not want large cap value to drag the portfolio nor do I want ""balanced"" across all landscapes; Factor investing allows you to enjoy picking the %'s of the total market while enjoying indexing gains across the board.  Some people call these ""tilts"" which is fine."

2021-04-10 01:12:33,stocks,[deleted]
2021-04-10 13:36:31,stocks,Large cap drags down your portfolio? Is this because small and mid caps have more room for growth?
2021-04-10 16:56:28,stocks,"There's also VO, which is a mid-cap that pairs well with VOO."
2021-04-10 01:14:01,stocks,"I explained the differences above - exposure to mid, small and micro cap stocks, somewhat better risk mitigation and early exposure to rising stocks."
2021-04-10 13:44:46,stocks,"Correct.  Large cap have less opportunity to double which is what mid-cap, small exposure allows you to capture.  Total market like VTI would be more attractive if they rated large cap at 55% instead."
2021-04-10 14:11:28,stocks,How do you like qqqj? I have this as well along with arkg and arkk.
2021-04-10 14:42:16,stocks,I don't house any particular tilts of tech or managed funds outside of AVUV at this time.

**Value Play**

I can't provide the link to the article, but it is titled ""Volkswagen Is Undervalued And Is Perfectly Positioned For A Cyclical Upturn,"" written by ""The Value Analyst.""

I'll quote this part, though:

> Price to Sales remains at 0.66 and P/E remain at 10. For a company whose long-term growth potential is around 5-6% this stock is modestly priced. Although with similar growth rates many similar stocks trade at a much higher level. Cash flow tends to be a lot more volatile for VW and quite often in the negative due to capital expenditures. In general cash flow is not a good metric for vehicle manufacturers. The current ratio remains around 1.15, and that's quite good for a car maker.

> Overall, the state of finances remains solid, and there is certainly some value in the stock. A conservative DCF that assumes 8% WACC and 5% growth, with a terminal rate of 0%, shows the stock is likely valued at around $42.

Where I differ with that author, of course, is my position that a PT of $42 for VWAGY should apply *only* to Volkswagen's ICE and hybrid businesses.  Of the total auto sales of 9,305,400 units and €222.9 billion, the PT of $42 should apply *only* to 9,073,800 units and sales growth therein.

Furthermore, a slight discount could be applied if VW spins off its Porsche brands as a separate company to raise funds.  The company sold 272,200 Porsche units in 2020, so Volkswagen's ICE and hybrid sales less these amounted to 8,801,600 units.  An adjusted PT of $40 would be appropriate than what was suggested in previous DD.

An adjusted PT of $40 means that the ICE and hybrid businesses minus Porsche should be worth €172.6 billion.

**Next Tesla Play**

Forget value investing.  Forget problems with being asset-heavy instead of being asset-light (i.e., as opposed to richly valued growth stories in the tech sector).

We want the next bubble play!  We want the Next Tesla!  We want tech valuations!  We want price-to-sales valuations!

[As of March 19, Tesla's price-to-sales ratio is 22.04.](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/tsla/tesla/price-sales)

Thus, let's scrutinize the 231,600 EV unit sales for 2020 and [Volkswagen's goal to become the consumer EV market leader by 2025](https://www.barrons.com/articles/this-is-how-long-it-takes-to-become-an-ev-player-51616075163).

The biggest non-Tesla pure play in the consumer EV space, NIO, sold over 43,700 units in 2020 for a [gross margin of 11.5%](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-reports-unaudited-fourth-quarter-and-full-1).  As of March 19, its price-to-sales multiple is higher than Tesla's, at 26.60, despite not having the latter's cutting-edge battery technology or autonomous driving technology.

Not far behind are Li Auto and Xpeng, which sold approximately 30,000 units and 27,000 units in 2020, respectively.  Their respective gross margins were [16.4%](https://kr-asia.com/ev-maker-li-auto-generates-strong-profits-as-deliveries-surge) and [4.6%](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210308005328/en/XPeng-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2020-Unaudited-Financial-Results).  They trade at similar price-to-sales multiples despite lacking Tesla's cutting-edge battery technology or autonomous driving technology.

Even when combined, these claimants to ""second mover advantage"" sold far less consumer EV units than 231,600 units.  It is clear here that the real second mover is Volkswagen, not these pretenders.

Without further information, a *minimum* monetary estimate of Volkswagen EV revenues in 2020 is €5.55 billion: €222.9 billion in total revenue x 231,600 EV unit sales / 9,305,400 total unit sales.  Since EVs are currently more expensive than less clean vehicles, their EV revenues should be noticeably greater.

Every bubble play has a price-to-sales multiple of at least 20.  Therefore, the consumer EV business of the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, *should have already been worth at least €111.0 billion last year*.  [Deutsche Bank has recently stated that this particular business should already be worth €195.0 billion.](https://fortune.com/2021/03/22/volkswagen-vw-db-report-ev-business-tesla/)  However, this is a conservative estimate, as the company has beaten its earlier EV unit sales targets, and again because EV are currently more expensive than less clean vehicles.

How much further should this EV-related market cap ""stonk""?

Well, [Volkswagen plans to sell at least 450,000 all-electric vehicles this very year.](https://www.carscoops.com/2021/03/volkswagen-shares-soar-on-the-back-of-ambitious-ev-targets/)  If this is realistic, then the consumer EV sales could reach €10.78 billion.  Accordingly, the consumer EV business could be worth up to €215.6 billion, not €195.0 billion.

**Grossly Undervalued Like Yesterday**

As of March 19, VWAGY closed at a mere $34.15; Volkswagen's entire business has been valued at a mere €147.4 billion.  The upside to $40 strictly on the value play means that the market cap for Volkswagen's ICE and hybrid businesses, minus any potential Porsche spinoff, should be €172.6 billion.

The EV top-up of €215.6 billion suggests that a more appropriate market value *as of yesterday* should have been €388.2 billion.

In other words, **VWAGY should have been trading at around $89.94 yesterday, folks!**

**EV Economy Matters**

[Volkswagen will switch to producing all its battery electric vehicles with bidirectional charging features next year.](https://thedriven.io/2021/04/07/volkswagen-wants-to-stabilise-grid-by-adding-v2g-in-all-its-electric-cars/)

> For the Volkswagen group, it will also set it apart from Tesla, which is more focused on having its cars on the road in service as autonomous taxis.

Forget comparisons of Tesla vs. Volkswagen to Apple vs. Samsung.  Tesla could very well be the Yahoo of EVs.  Volkswagen could very well be the Google of EVs.

**Ten-Bagger Opportunity?**

As for the more ambitious part, management released this mother of all Investor Presentations:

[Leading the Transformation](https://www.volkswagenag.com/presence/investorrelation/publications/presentations/2021/03/2021-03-16_Deep_Dive_Dahlheim.pdf)

Just how much of a mother of all Investor Presentations is this?

Many of those who have benefitted from the recent gold rush of EV startups will surely have noted the latter's Investor Presentations showing their respective paths to eventual sales and eventual profits.

VW's sales of 231,600 consumer EVs in 2020 dwarfs what any of these startups could ever achieve.  The company is aiming to achieve annual battery electric vehicle sales of 3,000,000 consumer EVs by 2025.  It is aiming to overtake Tesla itself by then, possibly even as early as next year!

That the future market leader in consumer EVs expects 3,000,000 consumer EVs to constitute a sales mix of only 20% means that it expects to steal market share from the dinosaurs amongst traditional / legacy / Big Auto manufacturers.  [Hello, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, Hyundai, Honda, Daimler, and Toyota!](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mls9iv/electric_vehicles_even_when_volkswagen_overtakes/)

If they sell only a little over half this, then consumer EV revenues should be in the neighborhood of €36.00 billion.

If they sell the full 3 million, then consumer EV revenues should be in the neighborhood of €71.86 billion.

Thus, the consumer EV business could, by 2025, be worth anywhere between €720.0 billion and €1,437.2 billion.

If they sell only half the 3 million by 2025, then Volkswagen can reach a value of €892.6 billion, or $1.1 trillion USD.

**If they sell the full 3 million by 2025, then the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, can realize a ten-bagger opportunity and reach a value of at least €1.6 trillion, or $1.9 trillion USD.**

Doesn’t sound good. 



No clue where you are getting those forecasted 2020 EV sales data or why it’s relevant. You don’t make any point about it. 


Tesla as a whole gets 20 P/S so VW EV should get 20 multiple too? What? Try comparing to Ford or gm lol. Absolutely mental valuation metric. 


Make sure to deduct the likely $100b from your refined calculation for the EV buildout cost. And make sure you lower your net profit if you’re doing any sort of weighted pricing because Vw margins will shrink as they split the difference with dealerships. 


Comparing EV startups to Vw is the funniest thing I’ve seen in an EV valuation.

Beijing’s market watchdog began investigating Alibaba in December for potential antitrust violations including preventing merchants from selling their goods on other shopping platforms. On Saturday, the regulator said its investigation had concluded that Alibaba had hindered competition in online retail in China, affected innovation in the internet economy and harmed consumers’ interests.

Alibaba said in a statement that it would accept the penalty “sincerely” and would strengthen its internal systems “to better carry out its social responsibilities.”

Skepticism about the clout of large internet companies has been on the rise in the United States and Europe, too. Western regulators have repeatedly fined Goliaths such as Google in recent years for various antitrust violations. But such penalties generally have not changed the nature of the companies’ businesses enough to mitigate concerns about their power.

2021-04-10 01:50:59,stocks,"I personally feel this is nothing but bullish. While yes, the fine is large in terms of past regulatory fines, it’s nothing for BABA, and the CCP knows this. If they made it any less it would matter even less, and there’s nothing I’ve read in any publications so far that even mentions the possibility of a split, or operational cut.

That being said,  it’s obvious the dark clouds of mystery are parting. As good traders know that the worst place to be in the market is awaiting bad news, the bad news itself , unless catastrophic, is always bullish given it implies the next step is a return to predictability.

I expect premarket, and maybe Monday - Wednesday to be rough as the market reshuffles, but if it does dip, it’s nothing more than an excellent buying opportunity.

I’m unfortunately maxed out on summer calls as of Friday, in about 42k worth. I may open up more of my port to more calls if the dip is greater than 2%."

2021-04-10 02:31:54,stocks,"Based on this thread a lot of people are invested in Chinese companies without an inkling about how things work over there.

For one, Alibaba were already in big trouble before Jack Ma made his infamous speech. That's the whole reason he made the speech, because everything is done through back channels there and he already knew what was and is to come. 

I see people buying into the Jack Ma is a visionary idea when in reality it's not like he was the only one to see an opportunity by taking Alibaba into the finance industry, it's just that operating in the finance industry in China (remember the country with insane capital controls and so on?) comes with a lot of regulations. Alibaba tried to step into the game and ignore all the regulations because they are a tech company. The fact that they were stopped puts a halt on a ton of their activities outside of their core business. 

The Chinese government picks the winners and they aren't interested in returns to shareholders.

The bull case for a lot of major Chinese companies is that they are owned by the elites of the party so they have vested interest in their success, but these elites can also invest in the next winners if the government decides Alibaba has had its time."
2021-04-10 07:56:17,stocks,All stocks have risk but China stocks are stupid risky.
2021-04-09 23:37:40,stocks,"Im done with BABA, ever since China started playing around with Jack Ma and making him disappear and reappear.

One of the most important things behind a innovative tech growth company, is having good leadership who is willing to implement new ideas. China blocked the Alipay IPO. Alibaba is compromised at the top. Who is really running this company? Is Jack Ma have to walk on eggshells moving forward.

Plus the whole US/China compliance and possible delistingelisting risk makes me want to stay away. There's plenty of other ecommerce companies to invest in, including international ones.

I'll keep my NIO shares though, risk of delisting is much lower, and their CEO is not being messed around with."
2021-04-10 00:00:51,stocks,"There seems to be a lot of ""hopefully"" in the comment section. Yes the fine is small, but preventing BABA from being a monopoly in its own market and in markets it was trying to enter can't be a good thing. If you don't think a company making record profits can trade sideways for years, look at MSFT after its antitrust suit.

P.S. Not financial advice"

I think they really need to distance themselves from him and buy his shares back to really put this behind them.  As long as he has a large stake, Pooh will continue to stifle financial growth. Also, $2.8B is more than a slap on the hand - 2020 net income was a little over $19B, so it’s 14%.  That stings.  I’m hopeful the stock goes up, and am somewhat reassured with Munger buying, but the stock would perform better if Ma was completely separated from BABA."

2021-04-10 00:00:39,stocks,"Edits below for the angry people. 

Might actually help. Now everyon knows that BABA's price for the CEO (Edit for the angry people: ex-CEO, big figurehead, 3rd largest shareholder with a massive amount of other business interests in China and beyond) crossing the Chinese President has been paid.

Everyone was waiting to see how bad the backlash would be. 

Now they know. 

I feel like fear of the unknown is worse than a company losing $2.8B when it comes to buying stocks. 

For perspective [link to research here for people who are up in arms about the numbers rather than just taking to point which is that $2.8B is nothing to Alibaba Group](https://www.macroaxis.com/financial-statements/BABA/Revenues)

BABA has $1629.1B in assets which means they were just fined 0.17% of what they own.

It's the same financial impact of someone who has $80,000 saved who is forced to pay $136.

They are projected to make $632.4B in revenue in 2021 so the fine is 0.44% of their revenue.

In comparison, if you made $80K a year, you would have to pay $352 of your salary.

Baba basically just got a big parking ticket."

It didn't change their monopolistic position but it increases the likelihood of Alibaba yielding in tax & counterfeit goods regulatory disputes in the future. Personally, I would judge this as a slap on the wrist for Alibaba for now but they really need to lay low for a long time.

I think the market was expecting much worse from China, but it honestly does seem that they want to adopt more capitalistic policies to continue the innovation and growth in their county. The other major FUD is the US delisting threat, but I honestly can't see that happening since US investment banks make so much money off of selling the ADRs, and there is so much foreign money in the business."
2021-04-09 23:06:16,stocks,BABA trades higher now. The market hates uncertainty and now the outcome is certain. They pay the fine and life goes on. Long term structural bull case is in tact.
2021-04-09 23:04:35,stocks,time to buy now :)
2021-04-09 22:25:20,stocks,They have 70 billion CNY but yeah it’s still such a small drop in the bucket.

2021-04-10 11:17:44,stocks,"It's hard to say, I sure hope it's factored in. But if you look at the chart in the past few weeks, it went up and down and has tested lower 220s a few times."
2021-04-10 05:09:55,stocks,"It’s 4% of 2019 revenue but due to the growth last year, only 2% of 2020. Big win as a baba share holder"

2021-04-10 15:48:18,stocks,"I was hovering on the sell button at $315 but got greedy and wanted to see if Ant would cause it to overshoot.  Big mistake.  Finally dropped out around $260 I think, as source of funds for something else.  Been waiting for it to be safe to get back in the water.  

Still, it's worth reminding ourselves that with thousands of other stocks not subject to China risk, is it necessary to play in BABA?"
2021-04-10 02:49:22,stocks,"Lmfao double in only 4 years...

2021-04-10 06:45:09,stocks,"There’s a lot of financial analysts using the F word around baba too. I’ve used the website and gotta say it didn’t help my suspicion surrounding them as it’s the most janky marketplace website I’ve ever used, but I did my goods that I ordered, but I did need to chat with someone after they claimed I still needed to pay more until I showed them the screenshot of what I paid then they said it was fine. I think people should at least use the website to buy something and see what they think.

The potential is there because of the Chinese manufactures and prices seem super cheap but when the shipping costs get added at the end the prices aren’t what they seem initially."
2021-04-10 00:31:12,stocks,"Because people are gassed up on e-commerce hype.

Unaware of the fact that they are buying 0 actual ownership of BABA which has no responsibility or motive to correctly report its Chinese operation figures

But they see large funds investing billions, not realising these large funds are only investing 0.1% or less of their entire portfolio but 'if it's good enough for them it is for me' *hurr durr let's go for a safe 20% of my portfolio*"

2021-04-09 22:25:15,stocks,"Agreed. As of Dec. 31, its balance sheet included $47.8 billion in pure cash, with net assets north of $100 billion dollars. Strong balance sheet."

After all, we look for money from its growth rate of more certainty in the company. You can actually buy other companies and still earn same amount of money with less political risk.

I have around 2k usd of baba stocks, but I won’t cash out until I urgently need money. But this stock is a no buy anymore."
2021-04-10 10:09:44,stocks,"Also Jacky is a complete moron. Seriously, listen to the YT video where he's on stage with Elon Musk. Let's not make this about Musk, but Jack Ma sounds like a blabbering baby. Elon can barely contain himself, it's hilarious."
2021-04-10 03:30:52,stocks,Microsoft has a completely different business model then baba at that time the comparison is laughable. Baba has a high growth cloud division at 4% global market share and is entering the international market. The antitrust will allow sellers to sell on other platforms in addition to baba. Sure that will make them lose some revenue but other sellers will also come in. The Chinese e-commerce platform is the fastest growing in the world and baba will continue to grow with it despite having sellers able to sell across platforms. That did not justify a 40% drop in share price where as Microsoft was a stagnant company with no real growth until 2014
2021-04-10 00:17:54,stocks,"Stock prices are based on projected future cash flows. Paying this fine does effect them currently, but is outweighed by the fact that they will be allowed to continue operations which have proven to be very, very profitable."

2021-04-09 23:15:57,stocks,This is good news though.I’m surprised the fine isn’t 7 billion

2021-04-10 05:10:57,stocks,Sitting on 70 billion cash....
2021-04-10 18:29:03,stocks,Priced in. Should run. Maybe panic selling causes slight dip but it’s buying opportunities in my opinion and easy short term recovery. This just clears of uncertainty over BABA that has kept it stagnant
2021-04-10 05:12:39,stocks,Calls. Max fine was supposed 10 billion and threats were to break up large divisions. None of these are concerns anymore given this recent development. 2.8 billion is nothing when you have 70 billion cash in your bank account
2021-04-10 07:09:53,stocks,"Honestly I’d have both puts and calls on baba, I can see it going to the floor or 1,000 in the next 2 years."
2021-04-09 22:35:38,stocks,"Pretty sure Costco hinders competition, they operate at a loss on a number of their products; pretty much the entire food court, rotisserie chicken. 

Economies of scale by definition hinders small business competition, it’s why you don’t see small supermarkets in big cities.

Monopsonies in towns/small cities quite literally intentionally drives all competition out of business.

Edit:

But if you look at it through an eyeglass of non-basic-economic-operations, yes Costco is a very reputable company."
2021-04-10 13:27:33,stocks,"I know for sure at least three ""mom and pop"" restaurants in my home town used costco as their supplier for some of their produce, cooking supplies and other odds and ends. 

I'm not sure if that makes them any more or less anti-competition on the large scale, but I don't think they're always bad for small businesses."

2021-04-10 00:48:51,stocks,"It's that, but much more than that. The fine is not trivial, but the business can absorb it. What nobody on this thread seems to be discussing is the dissolution of Alibaba's ""choose one of two"" policy, which allowed them to operate as a monopoly. I can see no way that the loss of such an ability to strong-arm competitors could not materially affect them going forward.

Not saying the company is in trouble, or its business is bad. But this goes beyond a one-time fine."
2021-04-09 22:37:47,stocks,I agree but hopefully this is just a little slap on the wrist and Beijing will move on.

2021-04-10 06:40:04,stocks,They must have so much cash because they don’t spend any on their actual website. It’s like a marketplace that a college student would make. If they didn’t have the value of having all those Chinese manufactures on board the website would be a complete joke
2021-04-09 23:27:59,stocks,Ikr. Could we just get a glimmer of a US valuation? 😅
2021-04-10 00:25:13,stocks,"That would be because you actually are buying dirt my friend

2021-04-10 00:05:55,stocks,It's actually probably a good time to buy.
2021-04-09 23:55:48,stocks,Lol
2021-04-10 00:22:23,stocks,Why? There is literally about 10 months of bad news one after another. Like you bought a stock without even opening google? I am a little salty because I bought in about two weeks before Jack Ma said somethings which the Chinese gov did not like and ANT was about to be a blockbuster IPO. Were you like BABA sounds funny I will invest in that?
2021-04-10 00:20:20,stocks,I agree. My avg basis is around $275 and I’m not worried lol I’m hopeful that it will go up.
2021-04-09 23:23:50,stocks,for who? we cant buy it ?
2021-04-10 05:16:09,stocks,Because they are giving them 3 years to send reports of their compliance based on internal investigations. Basically saying let other sellers be able to sell at other platforms and we will leave you alone for at least 3 years.

2021-04-10 04:02:25,stocks,"While I’m overall bullish on BABA, I still think the long-term ramifications of this are up in the air. In my opinion, Xi has been looking to exert a lot of CCP control over the core Chinese companies to expand the Chinese market. While overall, I think that should be good for a company, what it means for a publicly traded company on a US stock exchange I am skeptical of."

Is it alibaba.com? I’ve ordered some things from that website and there’s no way that website is doing any type of numbers like Amazon. I mean you have to chat with someone to get a single sample most of the time. That doesn’t seem like a scalable model of ordering things. I know it’s supposed to be a b2b but that doesn’t really change the fact that their main website is way hankies than you would expect from that size of company."
2021-04-10 14:48:25,stocks,Agree - just stating $2.8b at 14% NI is not a “slap in the hand” to shareholders.  Distance from Ma’s sizeable stock ownership is key to easing govt scrutiny.

2021-04-09 22:40:10,stocks,"It was an and statement. Costco may hinder competition but they don’t hinder competition AND negatively affect innovation AND work against consumer interests. That’s at least how I interpreted it. With their very low (sometimes, as you said, negative) margins they definitely don’t work against consumer interest. Right?"
2021-04-10 03:05:28,stocks,Do I smell a free market argument... Hmm
2021-04-10 08:26:56,stocks,You cant really say they operate on a loss on anything if quarter after quarter they print cash.
2021-04-10 09:04:24,stocks,I think the food court doesn't really operate at a loss anymore other than the hot dogs. Prices on a lot of items have rose more than 50% in the last 4 years.
2021-04-10 09:08:22,stocks,So there is a coffee shop where everything they sell comes from Costco. Even the pastries come from Costco. I would think Wal-Mart has a much larger impact on small cities and towns.   Costco average pay is around 22 an hour so they pay the employees a really good wage which keeps turn over down.
2021-04-10 09:30:32,stocks,"> it’s why you don’t see small supermarkets in big cities.

Some companies even create their own competition by starting similar companies with different names. This makes it harder for competitors to make a profit. Starbucks was known to do this."

2021-04-10 08:47:38,stocks,"What??? I don’t think you know what “hinder competition” means. Costco was incredibly innovative with their business model, that’s why they’re successful. Them selling some products at a loss is not at all the same as other companies temporarily reducing prices to unsustainable long-term prices to weed out competition because CostCo can afford, and make quite a handsome profit, by selling those individual stable products at a loss. 

Your arguments make literally zero sense......... large companies are hindering competition because they are able to offer sustainably lower prices than small businesses???????? That’s just called companies realizing consumers don’t give a shit about small businesses or any of the greatly exaggerated services they offer more than they care about price. Nothing better meets the definition of fostering competition than knocking out companies less able to meet consumer demand while increasingly being able to better meet it. 

Oh this is r/stocks lol no wonder"
2021-04-10 16:42:14,stocks,It works both ways sometimes they do it for the opposite reason and Walmart does it too. I used to sell TVs at circuit city and we used to do 0% financing for like 2 years with a match. Naturally people came to us with a ton of price match requests because they could not pay anything for 2 years. Basically every Walmart and Costco tv had its own sku for basically the exact same tv and our POS system couldn’t recognize it so we couldn’t price match.

2021-04-10 02:03:53,stocks,Don't worry. It's just a slap on baba's tits. They just need to pay more to keep the privileges.
2021-04-10 00:04:43,stocks,"Yes. It's far more political and more about pride.

The CEO criticized the Chinese state banking system. Then he went ""missing"". Then they threatened this law suit. Then fined them.

BABA is their Amazon. China can't afford to destroy that company. It would ruin domestic trade and foreign trade.

But pride has to be served. So the CEO got a time out and a slap on the wrist.

It was a message. The ring has been kissed. As long as the CEO doesn't fuck up again, life is good for everyone."
2021-04-10 00:22:44,stocks,"I mean, at least it’s a real sounding fine for wrong doing, unlike how the West had been handling their tech monopolies. Probably a good sign honestly, will make the company better."
2021-04-10 00:02:49,stocks,"The EU motivations are probably more genuine.

For all we know this is all an act and the fine is going to be paid in Monopoly money.

2021-04-10 17:34:09,stocks,"Fair enough. I think that's the problem with stocks in China. And maybe the benefit. People are anxious so it keeps the stock price down below its value. But, as you point out, anything could happen and the whole thing could implode."
2021-04-09 23:49:35,stocks,"Stocks are forward looking, so a resolution means no more unknown bad news regarding government actions to look forward too, therefore the stock can start marching up again. 

The same way Google marched up after the fine was formally announced and we all knew the extent of the actions against it. Get the bad news out of the way."
2021-04-09 23:44:19,stocks,"It's not, this is people trying to delude each other into thinking BABA won't be affected by the news. I have stock in it too"

2021-04-10 00:05:38,stocks,Yeah. It's basically a parking ticket compared to what they own and have as income.
2021-04-10 01:09:42,stocks,No. Because it’s China.  They could step in and shut them down at any moment.  Is it likely? No.  But it’s not a non zero possibility and that’s why it won’t trade at a US multiple.  Same reason every foreign oligarch wants to park money in western economies.  Individual property rights jurisdictions command a premium.

There’s tons of search redundancies and just a lot of things and make the website feel janky.

You typically have to chat with someone who doesn’t speak very good English, even if just ordering a single sample, which doesn’t seem like a great way to handle the amount of orders.

Has anyone else who has used the website felt this way? 

I know it’s supposed to be a b2b but that still doesn’t excuse the overall lack of polish with a website and company worth billions. 

Like there’s no real reviews, or very little in that regard. 

There’s some financial analysts that use the F word when they describe Alibaba and having used the website, it’s just a bizarre situation. The potential is there but I just don’t know why the website isnt more polished."

Are you serious? The Chinese government **decides who wins the market in China**. They backed BABA and made them the market winner.

Costco is well known for being a great company to work for because they take care of you.

2021-04-10 18:53:27,stocks,"Doesn’t this just further push the idea that companies need to be massive and all encompassing, thereby hindering competition especially relative to small businesses? 

To elaborate; by saying that it’s okay for Costco to sell some items as a loss so long as they remain overall profitable, but it’s not okay for someone to sell at a loss if they don’t remain overall profitable, then you are essentially requiring that businesses be large enough, and with a massive selection of good, such that they can be profitable despite selling goods at a loss. 

As an example, if I open up a small family run store that sells various meat products, such as a rotisserie chicken. I sell this chicken at a modest 10% margin, which brings the price to $15. Meanwhile, Costco can already sell the chicken for $12 with the same 10% margin simply due to economy of scales, but instead chooses to sell it at $8 for a loss. My business would be killed very quick if I was charging double the competition, and yet it’s the best I can do to stay afloat. 

So, to bring this devils advocate argument to an end, by allowing to sell some items at a loss but not all items at a loss, you’ve stopped massive companies from killing competition with other massive companies but have not stopped massive companies from killing competition with small businesses."

I'm just saying, in this situation, the majority opinion in America say that big corporations driving medium and small ones out of business using aggressive loss leading is OK, but that doesn't make it inherently ethical, it just means people are OK with it and won't create any noise politically or otherwise about it."

So, if that company becomes a shithead, what you gonna do? If that company decides that to shop there, you have to send in your fingerprint details and your whole life history. You got no choice, no competitions to go to.

Obvs im exaggerating a bit, but that's the advantage of having competition, it protects the consumers interest because you can still have companies fight over you and want to be better than the other company because you have choices.

I'd argue choices protect the consumer's interest. Look at youtube for example, pretty much no other serious competitor, they can pretty much do whatever they like, and youll still be there because it's the only serious choice for video hosting on internet.

Hm, I wonder why. 

Ease of trading + meme stocks.

Every single year people claim there will be a crash. Majority of the time they are wrong. 

Low volume doesn't mean much TBH. Remember where tech was going into March, it makes sense volume is low as people aren't buying/selling a ton when they are basically HODL'ing.

You can always plan for the inevitable ""rug pull,"" but most likely you will not be able to time this properly and profiting off of this would just be random, dumb luck. Even if the market crashes, good companies always come out on top.

If jobs come in poor its even more reason to not raise rates bc he see we are still in a shitty situation and have to recover.

But this is might be a runaway train scenario: if the fed stops buying bonds now inflation will rise in the short term, the market will fall but at the cost of not having long term inflation issues. The rising yields would be seen in the housing market from yield spikes first in less than three months.

2021-04-10 09:21:05,stocks,"Alot of emphasis on ""rotation"" plays that got hammered hard by the pandemic. These plays were trading major discount after last March collapse. With the economy opening up these plays look attractive even though these plays are trading higher than pre pandemic or nothing in their business models suggest that they should be trading at this price. My best guess is that eventually big money will pull the rug on these kind of plays (retail, gas, airlines) sometime this year.

It's gonna get real ugly for these kind of plays later this year when earnings reports come out and their results don't show much of a rebound despite their stock trading at higher prices than pre pandemic. I don't get how retail stocks that face an uncertain future before pandemic is trading at recent highs. Or how Delta airlines is trading at 2019 levels or how Carnival Cruise somewhat rebounded with an uncertain future.

I think these plays will get sold, big money who snatched these plays at a discount then hyped up these plays as rotation will pull the rug and rotate that money back into Tech which would have cooled off at that point."

3. Energy, materials, and financials tend to rise at the peak of expansion. Job growth has been rising for a while. People are hopeful that covid will be over soon and taking more risks. I think we are at the peak of expansion.

&#x200B;

Things feel extended to me (high above the 200MA) so 50% of my swing account is cash. I'm hoping for a big dip. But I imagine the money boys will play their games and continue to re-write the definition of unemployment, GDP, and inflation for years to come, all in an effort to make numbers grow.

And the secret to success will always be spend less than you make. Don't ever risk that which you are unwilling to loose. For me, that's 2% of my net worth (that's all I ""play"" with), the rest is long term. This year I've made 12 wining trades and 9 loosing trades for a net positive of $744, and that could all change next week. There is currently red on my open issues.

2021-04-10 17:52:57,stocks,"When the March 2020 coronavirus drop happened pretty sure everyone and their mother knew the government would print money again like 2008 to not allow the system to fail.

It was also obvious that this was a significant but most likely a singular event meaning a vaccine would eventually be discovered and businesses would get back to normal aka return to their previous highs at some point.

So what did big money and average Joe's do? Bet the fucking house on it of course! Not just that but they leveraged it and pushed it to the fucking max because it was free money.

Now we are just past the 1 year mark and the market has been on a parabolic path right back to all time highs despite the pandemic still being in full swing in most parts of the world. Only thing that is different from before is that now we are leveraged to the fucking tits so I see 2 outcomes:

1. The world and business gets right back on track sooner than later without any hitches and the bull market rally will continue to be face ripping into insane all time highs, SPY to 500 in less than a year.

2. We hit a road bump along the way. A variant that requires a new vaccine to be developed, some type of rollout complication, unexpected inflation or rate hike, or another black swan or political event happens that will make the March 2020 dip look like a warmup.

Best guess as to which one will actually happen which is why we are all here I guess aha"

When you sell in-the-money call options, you collect the premium for selling lots of 100 shares at a set price in the future. So, if the price drops, the in-the-money options may become out of the money options and expire unexercised. Caching... You win."

Money is moving into those megacaps on the assumption of ""safety"" and because index and ETF investing has become a massive force in the market. There is very little security-level analysis being done anymore, which is why most of this movement makes no sense, since companies move one way or another together irrespective of their fundamentals.

Nordstream-2 is about to be completed. When it is, Ukraine will lose $4 billion in easy revenue from gas transport through its territory each year. They desperately need that money. They have to do something, so they've put troops along the border of the territories in Ukraine with Russian separatists, knowing this will put Putin under pressure to mobilize or risk an actual political threat for the first time in many years. And do something he has- he's put troops along the northern border of Ukraine and now it's a standoff. I hope to God no one does anything stupid. I feel sorry for Ukrainian people for their economic situation, but if something happens that results in sanctions against Russia and a halt to Nordstream 2 in the final days of its construction, it's still not likely to help Ukraine that much."

So it’s totally cool to fomo a bit until you see that pull-back and play the volatility and in the meantime buy some long Vix calls and weekly low priced spy calls. Not financial advice."

2021-04-10 02:55:02,stocks,"There’s a relationship with Government policies / monetary policy -> Inflation and interest rates -> growth in the economy.

When Biden decides to build stuff for 2 trillion or whatever, that’s expansive fiscal policy. This creates a huge demand in a lot of sectors like construction, and on short term the supply of materials in these sectors are limited so that pushes up prices (inflation). Generally inflation is related to interest rates. The central banks generally has a goal of 2% inflation because much higher inflation rates is generally viewed as bad for the economy. So when they start expecting too high inflation rates, they will start performing contractive monetary policies. So they have different tools to do this. One thing they can do i think, is to sell government bonds. Bonds are basically debt and the central bank functions as a lending machine. So when it starts selling debt its basically saying “i don’t want to provide money for loans for these bonds”. When they sell bonds they increase the supply of bonds, thereby putting a downward pressure on the value of bonds. Since the interest rate is basically the price of the bond, the interest rates on the bond market will increase. (This sounds wrong to me)

Banks will act on this and start increasing interest rates on their loans, because suddenly their corporate bonds needs to paid back at a higher interest rate.

People won’t be able to loan as much, so that decreases their demand for mortgages etc.

Also, some people will start defaulting on their loans and then at some point the market will fall back.

So i think investors are very sensitive to the inflation and thereby the interest rate. If the inflation starts increasing, the investors will start expecting higher interest rates and then start fearing a slowdown of the economy.

However the FED has actually been saying that they will compensate for years with inflation below the goal of 2% by getting that inflation at a later point -> they won’t mind an inflation of over 2% -> they won’t be running a very strict monetary policy.


I think that’s generally how it works. Inflation also affects the currency leading lowered import and increased export."

Having said that, 

>	Eventually...no one wants to sell their house for less. I postulate that the opposite is the first reaction to higher interest rates.

Okay so you’re saying less supply due to people not wanting to take a loss. Fair, but for those that do need to sell their house because they have to move for whatever reason will still have to find either a cash buyer or someone that can afford the monthly payment with raised rates. 

>	Fewer buyers at higher monthly payments cause fewer sellers so the don’t have to drop their price, then their is less inventory for sale so remaining buyers bid up house prices due to supply/demand imbalances.

Buyers bidding up the price of homes doesn’t make sense because if the buyer was for an investment property, they would wait for prices to fall, and if it were someone that was having to move for work, they would have a strict budget and would opt to rent instead of buying for the same reason. 

>	If everyone is working and we don’t have crap mortgage fraud, I don’t see a significant house price dip due to interest rates.

Below is the different monthly payments depending on the interest rate. 

Constants:
Average house in the US - $340,000
Down payment used - 20%
Mortgage amount - $272,000

Rates and payments:
Current interest rate - 3.32%
Monthly payment - $1.194

Interest rate on 2/10/21 - 2.97%
Monthly payment - $1,142

Interest rate in 4/2018 - 4.47%
Monthly payment - $1,373

Interest rate in 7/2007 - 6.70%
Monthly payment - $1,755

Interest rate in 5/2000- 8.52%
Monthly payment - $2,095

The DD they are showing you is old, and mostly hyped up falsities. The hedges DID have major shorts that came due back in March, now most of the shorts are held by smaller investors. The recent switch in the market is evidence of hedges swapping their portfolios to cover and rebalancing themselves. The shorts are minimal at this point. 

Now even many retail investors like myself are shorting those 2 stocks and using them as day trades which limits their growth as we sell and buy frequently, the profits will never be as high as they were for that reason. A has potential upon reopening for another short burst but that will fall at their next financials (debt load) but G has no catalyst and are poised to release an additional 1 million - 100 million shares further diluting the stock and drastically dropping the price, many many many investors will stand to potential destroy their lives solely based on the juvenile cult following of that stock.

The simplest explanation I can give regarding the shorts is, you don’t actually get to see who is shorting, you just see the total shorts, which a large part of that is now retail investors and not hedges. Once the stocks surpassed 5x the logical thing to do is short it as it will eventually come down. Many of the people currently posting profits on those 2 stocks are not doing it with shares but rather shorts/options (calls/puts) very few are trading shares now and many are still holding the bag. Always compare the DD you see posted against finviz, yahoo finance, and marketbeat. I find those 3 most reliable for new traders without over complicating things.

And not to be harsh but I browsed your profile, if you’re still holding those 2 shares hoping they will reach a profit I would suggest caution, watch the market volume and when you see it retreating substantially take your loss before it crashes too much. The less volume the less likely a stock price will climb in my opinion. You could also say trade the stock to make back what you’ve lost."

2021-04-10 00:00:00,stocks,"Is there any sensible reason to not short the SPX right now?  **Hi!**

First off sorry for the vague title. I don't know if this fits on this sub but I decided to take that risk.

Student here, working part time at an institutional asset manager (and not a native english speaker). I seem to be confused with the current market behaviour as it defies everything I've learned so far.

I would really appreciate if anyone could beat some sense into me and educate me as to why I shouldn't sell and heavily short equities right now. I already lost the biggest part of my portfolio this week but I just don't seem to be able to change my mind. 

To start let me summarize the current situation (note that the selected information will be biased by me, even if it's not conciously). I will mainly focus on the S&P 500 (SPX/\^GSPC) for simplicity and structure it like this:

\------------------

1. Index Price and Analyst Expectations
2. Indicators and Benchmarks
3. Economic Numbers, Trends, News and Sentiment

The rant is happening in part 3 mostly. I'm not sure if it's allowed but I linked some pictures with imgur-urls. 

\-------------------

**1a) Analysts Targets**

During this week, I heard about 10 Analysts from Banks and Asset Managers (GM,JPM,CS,UBS, some hedge funds) say that they expect the S&P to have an upside-potential to 4'200. The expected EOY-Median is also 4'200, though the Expectation for EOY 2021 was only 3'950-4'000 at the beginning of this year.

[https://imgur.com/3yr48h3](https://imgur.com/3yr48h3) (Short Term Boundaries)

It seems kind of weird to me how we almost already touched that 4'200 upper limit. Even weirder how every single analyst had the same target for the S&P 500 and every single one said ""we remain bullish on US equities"". Their explanations haven't really convinced me as none of them could really answer the shows hosts on the question why they remain bullish even though we're up that far already.

We hit ATH 20 times this year, with 5 of them having happened in the last 10 business days.

[https://imgur.com/UaU36hQ](https://imgur.com/UaU36hQ) (ATHs marked red (SPX Closing Prices))

With earnings ahead, I don't get how this should be going even further up. Especially on the news we're facing (see further down part 3).

\--------------

**1b) Volume and VIX**

* *Trading volume can signal when an investor should take profits and sell a security due to low activity. (Investopedia)*
* *In the U.S. stock market and many other developed financial markets, about 70-80 percent of overall trading volume is generated through algorithmic trading.*
* *The algos provide great liquidity when there is no news, but when a big new comes in the algos go away until things stabilize.*

Hmm okay. We had 70 business days so far in 2021 and out of the last 10 there are 7 days in the top 10 lowest daily trading volume (YTD, since 01-01-2021). If we're supposedly in 'bullish' situation, why is the volume going down so rapidly and the trading so frothy? Are the algos idling to meet the ESG-benchmarks or?

[https://imgur.com/aYBtNtd](https://imgur.com/aYBtNtd) (Rank of 10 last trading sessions (1=Lowest Trading Volume YTD on S&P 500))

We're also at the lowest VIX-Level on the 1Y-Chart which I learned is usually a sell signal (shortterm).

\-----------

**1c) Psychological Factors (SideNote)**

April has been the best performing month for US equities for the last two decades. April was performing net-positive in 14 out of the last 15 years (excluding 2008).

The best performing equities in april are historically european stocks, followed by US stocks.

Knowing that this month started at 3'992 (ATH) I'm having doubts that the trend will repeat this time though.

\-----------

**2) Technicals**

**2a) MA, MACD**

I'm kind of a believer in the theory that most technical indicators only work because actual systems and people trade by their principles. Having said that it's obviously kind of misleading to use momentum indicators as all of them are giving us strong buy signals even at ATH levels:

[https://imgur.com/QxEygiE](https://imgur.com/QxEygiE) (Barchart Indicators with their buy signals)

Just to note; we're obviously above moving averages at this point: 

[https://imgur.com/7kKPwvj](https://imgur.com/7kKPwvj) 

\-----------------

**2b) RSI, PE Ratio**

It's really difficult for me to evaluate the usefulness of value-based indicators like the buffet-indicator or the PE ratio. They ignore the decrease in interest rates and the influx of retail money into equities:

[https://imgur.com/S86bESi](https://imgur.com/S86bESi)

Without that in mind the stock-market values would look pretty wild at this point;

**2b) PE Ratio**

The same logic applies to price-to-earnings ratios;

[https://imgur.com/mKqm5G5](https://imgur.com/mKqm5G5) (Shiller/CAPE PE Ratio for the SPX)

Still ... what bothers me is that the PE ratios of US indices are so much higher than the rest of the world:

[https://imgur.com/2D415BE](https://imgur.com/2D415BE) (Shiller/Cape PE Ratio major equitiy indices)

The worst one is not even listed here - the current ratio of the NDX (Nasdaq 100) lies at 50.19!

It's as if investors don't expect any growth outside of US companies or am I interpreting that wrong? It's not like inflation is higher in the US either (though there is a certain depreciation in the USD).

And if the earnings so obviously don't matter (anymore), how can analysts like this guy from Credit Suisse say that the prices are soaring due to the strong earnings??? (Src; Bloomberg-Link)

And lastly I understand the 21day-RSI crossing 70+ as a sell signal or is that wrong again?

\----------------

**3) Economic Data, Trends, News, Sentiments**

Oh god here we go. I will not provide as much details and pictures so let me summarize the most important points IMO a bit:

3a) Job Market

&#x200B;

|Date|Actual|Expected|
|:-|:-|:-|
|25-mar|684|730|
|1-apr|719|680|
|7-apr|744|680|

* The weekly jobless-claims reached a pandemic-era low **2 weeks ago** (25-mar) which resulted in the index going up 50bp.
* **Last week** we had larger-than-expected jobless claims which resulted in the index going up 50bp.
* **This week** we had way larger-than-expected jobless claims which resulted in the index going up 30bp.

It's weird how these numbers were celebrated and being sold as the reason for rising equity prices with one reason being that the FED seemingly only talks about the job numbers as their motivation for propping up the economy.

Now that the numbers went bad they suddenly do not matter anymore. It actually pissed me off how Tom Keene saw these numbers on Bloomberg TV and said ""if we're being honest, how much do these numbers matter anyway? They are just transitory""... like ... why did you care about them before then?

\-------------

**3b) Inflation and Yields (fixed income)**

You guys probably kept an eye on the treasury yields too as they seem to have caused a small taper tantrum in the first days of march. Analysts expect the 10Y US Tr. Yield to reach about 2% this year. As the treasuries usually act as benchmark for other assets, mortgage interest rates and bond rates have spiked as well.

This SHOULD be bad for high-risk assets (also as in high debt-ratios) short- to mid-term like overvalued stocks as found in the Nasdaq/SPX-Components. News Outlets were talking for WEEKS about the reflation trade and the shift from growth to value stocks. There were theories about quant funds shifting big time etc. ... as it stands we're kind of back with our major growth indices though?

[https://imgur.com/3Fv1mVn](https://imgur.com/3Fv1mVn) (YTD: NDX and SPX above and 10Y Tr. Yield below)

It's not like the treasury yields have retreated much, but for some reason the major tech stocks all jumped 5% to 15% this week... and they're saying that financial corps will do the same next week.

The PPI data released today only indicates even higher inflation expectations - same in other countries like china (4.4% actual):

[https://imgur.com/vh4TDek](https://imgur.com/vh4TDek) (US PPI Month over Month)

I get that higher yields are good for the financial sector and that a depreciation in the USD drives US equities as well (and inflation in US = USD loses value c.p.). But I still don't see why tech jumped.

\------------

**3c) Risk in the financial sector**

With low yields (well until recently) the leverage ratio increased substantially and even the FEDs balance sheet kind of imploded due to the pandemic. There is so much money in the market and so much leverage just so guaranteed rates can be delivered ... I wonder how this is not a sign of risk to anyone?

We just had the bust of a fund with Archegos that erased about USD 194 billion of market value and a similar picture with Greensill capital or the supposed short-sellers of equities in january. Even after this, Credit Suisse somehow thinks that they have proper risk management lol. And I wish I wouldn't have to say that about one of our 'national' banks ... sigh. Oh and somehow Citibank just lost 500M in some transactions... woops?

\-----------

**3d) Tax revolution**

The current projects on better international tax collaboration, higher corporate and individual taxes, a minimum tax rate for companies etc.... all of this sounds like bad news for companies... but somehow it get's ignored??? Someone help me on this please.

\----------

**3e) Vaccination Progress**

At the current rate, we will achieve global herd immunity in 2022 with cases rising again in Europe and developing/industrial countries.

[https://imgur.com/Kh2blNg](https://imgur.com/Kh2blNg) (Low progress in less wealthy countries)

It seems like the lagging progress outside of the US doesn't concern the market in the least as we can see with ATHs on european and asian indices. I guess Tom Keene would say that these numbers are irrelevant anyway.

\-----------

**3f) Chip Shortage**

Major car manufacturers halted production (GM, Ford) this week and many tech products can't meet demand due to the delay in production (like the current MacBooks). It's a consensus that this issue will stay for a few years since the building of factory sites and so on usually takes a few years.

[https://imgur.com/4diq83G](https://imgur.com/4diq83G)

This is pretty bad news, right? Obviously this means that the market has to go up... like ... I don't understand. This is an obvious issue but somehow these stocks just go up ...

\---------------

There are many other bad news like the Ukraine conflict (where talks about a possible war exist) or the Oil price dilemma and uncertain future of crypto currencies. Or upcoming (major) bond auctions on monday with the release of the new fed bond buying program pace on wednesday. But I'm leaving it at this right now.

\---------------

Lastly I want to note my personal destain for Bloomberg News as they seem to be publishing some weird articles lately. There are major news but they kind of spin it into 'good news' and (for example) talk about the potential of SPX hitting 4'100+ this week instead. I mostly resorted to Reuters and selected smaller outlets last week for this reason.

\---------------

Ok guys, that's it. I would be happy to have someone explain me why I should be 'bullish' on the SPX. I just loaded up on puts (structured products) after losing most of my portfolio this week on rather heavily leveraged puts.

Thanks to anyone for reading this.

(Funny Im also a student whos in the same situation as you, bagholding may21 puts right now.)

But Im inclined to agree. Its a runaway train scenario: 
if the fed stops buying bonds now inflation will rise in the short term, the market will fall but at the cost of not having long term inflation issues. The rising yields would be seen in the housing market from yield spikes first in less than three months. The other is the fed continues to print money and the treasury continues to spend it into infrastructure, but by increasing the money supply even moreso it would make things worse long term IF and ONLY IF:

Government spending on infrastructure doesnt outpace REAL GDP compared to GDP. (Progress has to outpace inflation)

The question is if it really is, one example:  disappointing jobs report would be a good excuse to not raise rates since it gives sign ""we are still recovering""."

One thing that sticks out to me is your mention of volume which no one is really talking about. If you include AH on SPY, we have just had 11 Green SPY days in a row. That's INSANE and with the low amount of volume.

I understand your point of view and also believe that being bullish on SPY seems unreasonable right now. There is a lot of ""stonks only go up"" and all bad news = prices go up. There are stocks with PE ratio above 1000 or stocks with no revenue like PLTR priced at $23. Fundamentals are detached from the current market and some sort of correction needs to occur to change the sentiment.

The main thing I'm looking forward to is how the tone of the FOMC meeting is this month. Inflation is here, it is apparent. China has admitted to it and trying to battle it. Unemployment rates are faster than we predicted but the dovish stance by JPOW is the same. I wonder if we get the same old tone for this month and the next upcoming months leading to markets continue to be detached and rise or flat. If there is a change to his stance this month, I would expect that to be the catalyst for the stock market since FOMC has so much influence of the stock market."

Market is also compounding exponentially and so graphs from 20 years ago aren't really useful without a logorithmic comparison. It's no surprise to me the market keeps going up, and when the whales have had their fun, they'll correct it again like March and buy back in when they're ready. Also, a lot of rebalancing has happenend and these moves take time to mature. 

You should also consider that if there are growth stocks with exceptional earnings coming up, money could very well flow out of mega caps and back into growth. I think for now, though, it just feels like a ""wait and see"" where the next surge will come from.

So maybe the question is not whether to short the market, but instead: where else should people invest their money?

You mention jobless claims without comparing it to employment, why? Rising interest rates and inflation- if people are making more money, interest rates are less impactful. Also, rates would have to climb another 1% before they’re back to 2018 levels and equities were still climbing then.

>I would really appreciate if anyone could beat some sense into me and  educate me as to why I shouldn't sell and heavily short equities right  now. I already lost the biggest part of my portfolio this week but I  just don't seem to be able to change my mind.

You do not have to be Nostradmus to figure out that the market will likely go down after reaching new heights. The challenge is getting the timing right. 

The people betting on the 2008 crash had to wait a lot longer for the markets to catch up than they had anticipated.

As Keynes famously said: *""The markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.""*

&#x200B;

>The current projects on better international tax collaboration, higher  corporate and individual taxes, a minimum tax rate for companies etc....  all of this sounds like bad news for companies... but somehow it get's  ignored??? Someone help me on this please.

Given how most tax hike proposals tend to work out in practice, it is not a bad approach to treat these type of discussions as populistic marketing stunts until there is clear evidence suggesting otherwise.

Plus, international agreements on taxes are even less likely to lead to productive outcomes.

&#x200B;

>Major car manufacturers halted production (GM, Ford) this week and many  tech products can't meet demand due to the delay in production (like the  current MacBooks). It's a consensus that this issue will stay for a few  years since the building of factory sites and so on usually takes a few  years.

I am afraid I cannot find the source right now but someone working for a chip manufacturer stated this week that the current supply levels should be sufficient in theory. The problem is that the earlier temporary shortage lead to customers panicking and increasing their order numbers across the board so they would have stock piles of chips on hand to cover hypothetical additional future shortages.

It is a bit like the toilet paper shortages when the pandemic began. People did not actually use more toilet paper. But the fear of running out of toilet paper in the future did cause hoarding and created additional temporary shortages.

2021-04-10 12:35:43,stocks,I think the hedge funds are setting up a bull trap.

Totally! I'm seriously confused by the FED at this point. They seem to be in total denial of any inflation for the next few years and whatever is happening they stand with their decisions to prep the markets. Now that the PPI is above forecasts and the jobs below ... I wonder if they will still say the exact same thing? Like arguing it's all transitory. 

And I'm confused by how they only announced the extension of the SLR exclusion a few days before it expired end of march ... I don't even know when the new expiry is supposed to be as I can't find any info on it.

Anyway. I'm looking forward to the bond auctions on monday, info on the bond-buying program on wednesday and the upcoming FOMC as well.

True. Even if inflation was at a constant 2% per year the compounding would make it look inflated over time. And with low interest rates it's no surprise we're at these valuations I guess. 

>So maybe the question is not whether to short the market, but instead: where else should people invest their money?

Oracle, Simon Property, Kroger, Airlines, big tech Amazon. 

I think people just bought too much growth stocks that’s all. The rest is shorts scaring long term investors"

But its a question of time, and they cant escape from reality much longer. I just like how there is an increase in people talking about it which is sad but it gives me hope.
Have a great day man!"
2021-04-10 06:53:06,stocks,"Thanks for the reply. And since we're on reddit I'd say that's okay lol. 

And your advice seems like a nice voice of reason that I really need right now. I got way too emotional with my trading recently and ignored my usual risk-tolerance and stop-loss limit to the downside. Therefore even if I go short next week, I'll try to be cautious and rational just like in the past."

2021-04-10 18:22:45,stocks,I think this just goes to show that nobody has any idea WTF is going on.  This market is very weird.
2021-04-10 06:55:04,stocks,"There are cash-settled structured products (warrants, mini-futures etc) on OTC-exchanges so while it's not possible to short the SPX or have any direct influence on the index, it is possible to buy into a put-position that's gonna be settled with the issuer (a bank)."
2021-04-10 15:06:53,stocks,"Nuveen has a few, all of which target short calls on 55% of the held equities; SPXX, QQQX, DIAX.
There are others that write calls on 100%. All depends on the level of potential gains you're willing to give up. 

I know Global X also has some  as well; XYLD, QYLD."
2021-04-10 17:20:45,stocks,"I fully agree. 
And there's different ways to play it. For the 2nd & 3rd quarters, I'd bet on financials since earnings are likely underestimated as rates go up. 

Otherwise, if you prefer sticking to index funds, SPY and DIA will likely do very well, but with significant volatility. The increased volatility could mean a potential for better returns from an overwrite strategy, but you'll have to move out of that strategy if everything rallies or risk capping your gains."

2021-04-10 10:57:21,stocks,"Different subreddit, same clowns"
2021-04-10 10:59:17,stocks,"The bears are usually short term traders which make sense for people with shorter investment horizon to pull out from the market. 

The bulls consist of half Video Game shop investors and half wealthy individuals who can afford to buy every single dip

50% bears 50% bulls meaning stock market will trade sideways for the entire ways. That’s my prediction. There’ll be few winners and a lot of stocks doing nothing with no volume."
2021-04-10 06:58:20,stocks,There was this article (I think on Reuters?) where an analyst said that he expects a 10% correction in the next few months. I don't know if that's realistic as I'm more on your side with the midterm-bullishness ... but I really don't understand how there are three weekly gains with no major set-back or breather.
2021-04-10 19:00:08,stocks,You don't think the market is going to crash? SPY is currently seeing a 1.62 put/call ratio

2021-04-10 11:01:41,stocks,"I’m not in the market of predicting where the market will go, but I think results over time speak for themselves. Also, we just had a 10% correction in tech. Definitely getting a prolonged bull session feeling."

2021-04-10 08:17:19,stocks,"No no you're right there! 

The spx was already <1% from the 4k level this year. So I don't want to denounce the value of the equities as a whole... 

I was just hoping for some breather on the way up. So my confusion stems more from the fact that there was seemingly almost no red day in the last three weeks and only a decrease in volume. So I'm actually just surprised how even on fridays there have been ATHs with mondays repeating the trend ... no profit taking, not really any big shift except out of energy corps and just a constant, low volume inflow of money."
2021-04-10 12:23:44,stocks,"You can see more than what's been seen so far this year. The most the S&P has pulled back this year is about 5%, and it never closed that low (it was just intraday). It had corrections of 7.1%, 9.6%, and 7.4% last year post-COVID crash. 

But then expecting the market to change the dynamics that have been at play since early November doesn't appear to be working. You have to make the rotations that have been going on break consistently or the pullbacks are going to stay light."
2021-04-10 00:00:00,stocks,"Watch out for Adobe (ABDE) nearing breakout levels, if critical levels are passed this could rise to $600 Adobe has only increased financially over the years, with Q4 2020 being it's best quarter yet. Revenue increase, expense decrease, buying back shares which is always great, and other [financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ADBE/financials?p=ADBE). Looking at technicals, it has already past its big resistance level ($500 since October 2020), with no signs of slowing down. The moving averages are starting to line up with each other, 50 SMA above 200 SMA. To me, staying above $500 would show strength, and creeping towards $510 could confirm a breakout. Even if it doesn't pop, it will at least be an obvious long hold and safe trade, most likely trading sideways, with analysts putting PT's well above the current price. I'm not very concerned about RSI right now, because if you zoom out to a 3y weekly, it's still not overbought, and FB who is having a breakout I expect to see with ADBE soon, has almost the exact same pattern. "
2021-04-09 22:09:05,stocks,"Didn't the ARK funds sell ADBE recently? I think they also sold some TSM. In my opinion, both are relatively weird sells by Cathie. Although, Cathie has been doing some weird shit lately, like buying RBLX.

Anyways, I always get paranoid when stocks I feel are safe for the future get sold by professionals. It makes me think I am missing something. I'm still waiting for a slight pullback before buying in. I should have bought early March."
2021-04-09 22:10:31,stocks,Wrong ticker. It’s ADBE
2021-04-09 22:09:22,stocks,What the hell does Adobe actually do? All I know about them is the annoying update alerts I ignore every other day. What is it that makes them so profitable?

2021-04-10 00:00:00,stocks,"How do afterhours/weekend trades work? Made a buy in what I thought was early trading hours, but it wasn't put through until way later. Looking at the [hours](https://www.nyse.com/markets/hours-calendars) is pretty confusing, but I assume as someone just buying/selling stock and not doing options or any special stocks (which I'm guessing are things like equities and tapes a/b/c on that page), that I should refer to just the NYSE National hours.

I'm on the West Coast and made a buy just after 4am here (so 7am EST) but the order didn't actually go through until 9:30am EST when ""core trading session"" started. On that page it says ""early trading session"" starts at 7am EST, so what does that actually mean? I as annoyed because once the order actually went through it was 80% higher than when I placed the order. I thought I had locked in the price when I placed the order but I guess not.

Also, how do people buy/sell on weekends? I know prices of a stock can fluctuate based on speculation or things a company does, but it also moves around based on buying/selling, which happens over a weekend too. But again, if I place an order on Saturday it doesn't seem to get filled until 9:30am EST Monday."
2021-04-09 20:23:28,stocks,"U must be enabled for extended hours, then also make sure your order is tagged for extended hours"
2021-04-09 21:09:06,stocks,"All of this above. Also, pre-market starts at 4 am EST and after hours go until 8 pm EST. But you cannot place a market order during those times. It has to be done as a limit order and allow for extended hours trading. At least that's how it is on Webull."
2021-04-09 20:47:57,stocks,"Lol, this is exactly how I got my one share of GME for $400 instead of the $196 I thought I was buying. You have to be approved for extended hours, and you have to flag your buy as such."
2021-04-09 20:22:22,stocks,"No, you don't lock in a price when placing an order, even during normal hours - you can place a market order or a limit order, but market orders get filled at whatever price the market is when it gets filled, and limit orders get filled at their limit price if and only if the market reaches that price (and usually needs a small dip to execute), as there might be others with the same limit that get executed first, especially if your order isn't in a lot of 100"
2021-04-09 20:23:49,stocks,"When you can trade depends on your broker. If you want to put through orders during extended hours make sure it's a limit order and some brokers require you to specify that it can be executed during extended hours. If it's a limit order you don't risk getting a goofy fill on a low liquidity stock. If you've ever seen weird candles on a chart with a really long wick during after hours that's often what happened.  This seemed to happen a couple times even in SPY last week if you look at the chart.

Each broker has different rules. With TDA for example you have to make it an ""EXT"" order instead of ""DAY"". for some stuff like SPY and QQQ ""EXTO"" is available which allows 24 hours trading. But that's very few things."
2021-04-09 20:20:40,stocks,"Never seen a stock price move on the weekend lol, you might be staring at the charts too long.."
2021-04-09 20:52:12,stocks,What trading platform do you use?
2021-04-09 20:18:49,stocks,Your broker may not allow after hours trading or it may be a separate order type. Name your broker. And nobody trades on the weekend.
2021-04-09 21:21:14,stocks,"You have to use a limit extended hours order to get a fill in the premarket/post-market session. 

Also, stocks don’t trade on weekends. Every exchange has its own operating hours. That’s why Asian/Australian markets are open while us Americans are asleep."
2021-04-09 23:19:28,stocks,"**Stock Exchange Hours (EST)**


- EXT: 4:00 am to 8:00 pm
- DAY: 9:30 am to 4:00 pm


**Order Execution**


Trades are made with either Market or Limit orders. Market orders can only execute during the DAY hours. Limit orders can execute on either DAY, or EXT hours. DAY is the default. You have to set the duration to EXT when entering the order. 


**International Stock Exchanges**


Your Broker is a type of “bank” ( they hold your money and provide financial services). The Broker sends your order to an Exchange. The Exchange is where the stock is traded. The Broker has to pay to connect to the exchange. So brokers only connect to exchanges that have stocks people want."
2021-04-09 21:16:00,stocks,The only place I see 4am on the hours page I linked to is for Bonds and Arca Equities. Am I missing something? Fixed hours are so damn annoying.
2021-04-09 20:33:51,stocks,"I thought there were exchanges in other countries around the world, and some businesses are international.....so what hours do they trade by?"
2021-04-10 00:46:12,stocks,"How do I access the 4am-7am window of trading? Currently I use TD Ameritrade and the EXT hours are only 7am-8pm, no options earlier than 7am."
2021-04-09 21:29:38,stocks,It appears you are missing the opportunity to trade in extended hours.
2021-04-09 22:56:11,stocks,ARCA is the New York Stock Exchange.
2021-04-09 20:42:20,stocks,"A quick google search will answer all of your questions I believe. There are some middle eastern markets with different schedules because their weeks start Friday I think, but it’s not common."
2021-04-10 02:24:45,stocks,"Your brokerage decides how early and late their extended hours will be. So yours are 7 am to 8 pm. However, TD Ameritrade has 24/5 trading for selected equities. Use the EXTO flag when submitting trades.

2021-04-09 23:39:47,stocks,Part of it.
2021-04-10 03:43:02,stocks,"Oh ok, thanks. One last question - are new listings available for early hours trading or do they have to wait until regular hours on their first day? I'm highly interested in the upcoming Coinbase dpo."
2021-04-10 13:15:03,stocks,"I don’t know if an IPO can be bought in the AM hours if the first day. 

You should place a limit order to buy CoinBase with EXT for the price it will be listed at. If it does not execute pre-market then it will execute at 9:30 on the opening bell."
2021-04-10 00:00:00,stocks,"Tech is king 👑 A few weeks ago during the pull back, talking points on CNBC included investors pulling their money out of tech and going elsewhere with it after realizing their gains. Nothing wrong with taking some profit. BUT, in what alternate universe do some live in where they believe tech would not be the leading industry for the next 10-100 years or more?

Positions: TECH HEAVY 👑"
2021-04-09 20:16:27,stocks,I’m betting my retirement on that. VGT is mostly what i dollar cost average into. My long term goal is biting into the Amal shared version.
2021-04-09 21:50:27,stocks,"Agreed. I have been buying the dips on a lot of the semiconductors - AMD, NVDA, TSM, QCOM. There is literally no end to the future of semis. Literally everything in your life will require chips: the phone or computer you're reading this on, the car you drive, your god damn house! There is no limit to the expansion of smart device technology and the interconnection of tech going forward."

2021-04-09 20:26:06,stocks,"How is tech not always the ""future""?

It was also the ""future"" in 2000, look where that got a lot of people.

Believe it or not tech DOES sometimes lag, and value sometimes does outperform.

But of course all the people who started in March 2020 have only seen tech go up in a straight line, and will not believe it."
2021-04-09 20:18:18,stocks,"Some people were invested during the year 2000 and 2007 and remember those crashes.  In the last 10 years NASDAQ has gone insane and I think lots of folks are waiting for a correction. Tech may be the leading industry but that doesn’t mean it isn’t overpriced. Sure, if your plan is to hold your tech portfolio for 20 years it’ll bounce back.

Taking profits short term also makes sense for a lot of people."
2021-04-09 20:26:39,stocks,"Waiting to see what happens with the semiconductor shortage. Otherwise, sure, tech for president."
2021-04-09 20:37:49,stocks,"So, do you think Tech should become even more of the SP500?

It is already 27%.

And the SP500 is trading at a PE of 40.

You know what stocks are still trading at single digit PEs?

Cyclicals and industrials. 

Almost all of the gains in tech over the last few years were from PE expansion, and not actual increases in profit.

Oh, and, statistically, the leading industry is the lagging industry 10 years later.

So, yeah, my money is on the companies that are trading at single digit PEs, and making TONS of cash, as opposed to over priced tech that have magic sky dollars."
2021-04-09 20:25:16,stocks,Facebook and Alphabet are not overpriced when you consider their growth rates and cash hordes and their ability to create products people want sometimes out of thin air. Some consumer staples and retailers (Costco) have higher PEs than Facebook for example. I think it is a pretty safe bet that tech companies have better growth prospects than consumer staples and retailers.
2021-04-09 21:48:35,stocks,"I've been buying up value.

Tech is what plummeted so that's where the value is right now. I'll be very tech heavy for the next 6 months. 

After that... UA outperformed a lot of tech stocks since last March. There are value stocks across industries. 

Do your DD either way."

2021-04-09 23:16:41,stocks,"It doesn't matter for stock returns whether tech is the leading industry, what matters is whether it's the most underpriced industry.

It could well be that the next decade of stock performance is driven by other industries benefitting from adopting tech, rather than the tech companies themselves."

2021-04-09 21:04:07,stocks,"The one where valuations matter. A company can be totally innovative and still have their stock price drop. Since valuations are based on some expectation of future cash flow, tech gets hit hardest in a rising rate environment. First, borrowing costs increase. Second discount rates increase, making the present value of future cash flows significantly lower."
2021-04-09 22:01:36,stocks,"I am mostly a value guy and I’ve done well, but I have been “buying the dip” on tech heavy etfs.

Multinational mega trusts with more power than most countries are king."
2021-04-10 02:42:43,stocks,"There's two things here that make the discussion difficult. ""Tech"" is vague and broad. Not really a great or descriptive category. The other problem is we're all pricing in some amount of growth and tech by it's nature is expected to grow fast, so we can price in more faster. People getting out of tech are trying to buy current value rather than future value for some reason. I think if we're confident in our picks, there's no reason not to be focused on the growth we know is coming especially when the momentum crowd bails."

2021-04-10 18:36:39,stocks,Yeah I’m heavy tech (mostly fang fi techs and semis)this is why I was meh on the news financials and industrials were running. Sure they can outperform for a few months but tech still rules this market and will for the foreseeable future.

Wouldn't this naturally push P/Es up? Yes, P/Es were also very high in 2000, but investing wasn't really available to the general public as it is today. Commission free trading didn't exist. Fees were pretty pricey if you wanted to buy in, so most people just didn't. Again, I could be wrong, but I think it fills quite a lot of the gaps."

Apple wasn't alone. Under Steve Balmer the good old MS was trading at very low numbers and seemed a fading gigant. Nowadays with new leadership MS has a glowing future. That said both could as easily have been shrinking rather then growing if not for some great people stepping in and turning it around in time."

2021-04-09 23:41:22,stocks,"PEs are mean reverting.

And, I suspect the reopening will result in alot of those traders going back to work, and just not having time to trade.

All I am saying is most Tech growth story PEs are incredibly high, and many cyclicals / industrials are trading at insanely low PEs, and are on the upswing of a cyclical.

I mean, CLF is trading at a 2021 PE of 4.5, MT is at similar, maybe 2.5.

Which is more likely?

Those PE ratios rise to even just 10,

Or the tech companies go from 20 - 40 to 40-80?"
2021-04-10 08:34:25,stocks,"MT for sure,

Then CLF, and X.

They are on a pullback right now.

Basically, read Vitards.

XME if you are just looking for a US mining and metals ETF."
2021-04-10 10:25:52,stocks,"For me, MT and CLF, as it was Vitards that opened my eyes to the under valued cyclical stocks. 

And RKT, as a bet on the US housing market. (ignore the short squeeze. It is over, and the shorts have almost fully covered now)

The core automakers F, GM, would have been good.

If you are looking for ETFs, XME covers mining and metals.

Edit:
I hold substantial positions in MT, CLF and RKT. 

I used to own TD, Riocan, but sold them for the above three, as they have a much higher likelihood of out sized returns. 

Frankly, RKT looks like an excellent 5-10 year hold, depending on how their ancillary businesses perform. My personal price target is $100-200 in 5-10 years... Which is why I missed out on line $300,000 of paper gains during the squeeze.

2021-04-10 02:49:23,stocks,"Curious what the historical PEs for steel companies are. I think low PE is pretty standard for non-growth companies that take one input (iron ore) and produce something else (steel) -- utility companies come to mind. Seems to me like the price of steel popping up (assuming it eventually goes back down in a year or so) just means a few quarters of massive profits -- why would that translate into a temporary 2 or 3x valuation? Because of an expectation for huge dividends?

I'm hoping I'm wrong, as I have a massive amount of options in MT and CLF."

2021-04-10 08:32:07,stocks,"Part of the benefit of having an absurdly low PE is that stock buybacks are extremely effective at increasing shareholder value.

This was right before steel prices went back down, and thus the stocks went down with them.

If they change that stance, they will lose the heat.

Both snapchat and Instagram would have replaced FB, if FB hadn't bought them.

2021-04-10 13:37:19,stocks,"They haven't bought ""every competitor."" You are hating on FB for having a keen eye for a good business model. FB bought IG for a billion dollars - it was not even close to being a competitor at the time. Government antitrust dept blessed the deal. it's not like they did something illegal - was not a hostile takeover and IG ownership agreed to the deal because they thought it was fair. Your crying sour grapes. And WhatsApp was a totally different type of business. FB is great at copying trends and has their version of TikTok now with Reels - nothing against the law about adopting new things. If it were then the push to start button in cars would only be in one car, but the entire industry copied it and there is nothing wrong with that. 

Facebook is run by one of the the best social media businessman of all time, and news flash, the entire point of business is to make money."

Let's say I bought some far OTM calls of Boeing. Let's use a 5/21/21 expiration with a $370 strike. They're going for .50 cents. So 1000 option contracts are approximately $50000. However, for this rule, are they considering 100,000 shares at a current price of $250, equaling $25 million, or the option price of $370 for a total of $37 million, or none of the above since I only paid $50k (and then later closed out the option position)?

If I do have to file, will it cost me anything? Or will there be any other negative implications?

I barely see anything about this on reddit, so I'm wondering if it doesn't even apply? It certainly seems I'd see a lot more talk about it if 50k worth of far OTM calls triggered it. I asked my brokerage to clarify what trades caused this to trigger the letter."

2021-04-10 00:00:00,stocks,"How will Chinese stocks recover? Many Chinese stocks have fallen recently due to fears of delisting, Chinese inflation and anti-trust regulations. The Chinese market is massive so I want to focus on just a few stocks in my questioning. Mainly Alibaba, JD.com and Pinduoduo.

DELISTING- First off, I do not believe a mass delisting will occur, and if it does, it will not delist massive corporations such as those named above and would instead target smaller cap corporations. This is the general sentiment of most analysts as well, as they agree the fear of this is overblown. There is no incentive to delist. Delisted companies could continue to be traded through over-the-counter markets in which massive amounts of money would be missed out on from the Nasdaq and NYSE. Also, if the goal is to delist due to concerns over accurate and ethical information reporting, the delisting of massive corporations such as Nio and Alibaba would be pointless because there is no reason to believe they are misleading investors. The only concern is among smaller cap corporations that definitely should be more moderated. I am not mentioning those within this but I acknowledge their mass delisting could affect all Chinese stocks, even if the concern is misplaced.

INFLATION- Inflation concerns caused a dip today in many Chinese stocks because data showed greater than anticipated inflation through a rise in PPI. The PPI hit 4.4%, the highest mark since 2018 while analysts were predicting 3.6%. For comparison, the US PPI is at 4.2%, the largest annual gain in 9 1/2 years while a jump in 3.8% was expected. Though the rate was higher than anticipated, I agree with analysts that inflation is a temporary concern across the stock market.

ANTI-TRUST- This is the largest concern I have. My main focus is Alibaba which holds >50% of the e-commerce market in China which is expected to grow faster as a sector in China/Asia than in any other market. Alibaba and other e-commerce corporations are being targeted with anti-trust fines and regulations seeking to limit their control over their business partners. Currently they have a policy that makes partners choose one company or another, they could not sell on both JD.com and Alibaba. This policy is under pressure from the government to increase competition. There is also a potential 975 million dollar fine being levied against Baba over similar anti-trust issues.

QUESTIONS-

Do you see Chinese stocks like Alibaba and JD.com recovering soon, if so, how quickly?

Should I be more concerned about inflation in China? I am not concerned about global inflation and American inflation, but the Chinese market could have some alternative impacts from inflation Im not considering.

What is the best play in E-commerce in China if anti-trust laws aimed at Alibaba pass and market share is decreased in the future?

Am I missing any other forces impacting these companies that I should be considering?

-


Thanks for reading and any feedback would be appreciated and you can definitely disagree. I tried to list my thoughts so you can understand my position on the situation. I just find it crazy calls for Alibaba for 300 expiring in a month are 20$. Is a quick turn around possible or will the price remain depressed?"
2021-04-09 21:57:39,stocks,Any good news with western govt. will send these stocks way higher.
2021-04-09 20:32:15,stocks,"i do think china stocks will recover because baba, jd, bidu, etc are all fantastic companies that won't be delisted and whatever. that being said, it's honestly just not worth the hassle of dealing with the negative pr affecting them because there are better options."
2021-04-09 21:43:45,stocks,"I’m on the same page as you. I carefully reviewed the balance sheet and income statements for baba and jd. They are just so undervalued no matter how you look at it. Baba trades at less than 20 forward pe and even less than that after accounting for net cash and investments. This is for a company that consistent grows 30% annually and has virtually no debt. Baba is ingrained into Chinese society even more so than Amazon to the US. Doesn’t matter if the company is delisted or fined, as long as the company continues to grow and generate fcf, I can’t imagine the price not increasing in the long run."

For sure it got decent price and P/E at the moment, but I would like to remind you that Chinese stocks price are heavily dependent on ccp’s decisions. You can get destroyed if you are not familiar with what ccp is doing and I can tell you that their decisions and thought process is somewhat irrational and different from western world. 

I am not any kind of people that asks you to sell off your Chinese stocks instantly, but me as a HongKonger, I have observed that many of my friends who have little faith to ccp don’t believe that Chinese company will grow to scales like any other US companies like FAAMG. We try to avoid ourselves from any Chinese stocks because of the these uncertainties. That’s why I am surprised that there are many bullish comments in the subreddit regarding Chinese stocks."
2021-04-10 10:11:50,stocks,The Chinese government taking it easy on some of the fear pressure they've been putting on investors.. all the talks of fines and regulation has not been a good look.  But any positive sign of them letting their companies run.. and they could run again

So why is the USA allowing Chinese companies to trade?

This is just my opinion.

I expect the divide to keep expanding, as China is now challenging the US (see Hong Kong).

If you think I am wrong, then the Chinese companies are a good deal.

If I am right, they have ALOT of room to fall."

I’ve gone back and forth on the delisting threat. One thing that made me feel better was Munger buying up a bunch of US-listed BABA earlier this week. I think the threat is there and is real and but the discount is already in. I also think this is an easy US political punching bag but I don’t know if they’d actually go through with delisting rather than make threats. I sold my JD/BABA a few weeks ago and bought back in earlier this week and decided to just hunker down with them. Would love to buy them on the Hong Kong exchange but sounds like a pain in the ass."
2021-04-09 22:21:06,stocks,"I think the largest threat with Baba is that in the past it has been favored by the CCP and broadly left to practice as it sees fit, but with the anti-trust actions, it seems thats come to an end. But I don’t think this dampens the entire sector at all.

I agree with everything you said, just to add a word of caution though, the main threat to me would be a reduction in market share. But e commerce in China stands to grow more than in any other country or market so I’m not sure how that will play out for future valuations."
2021-04-09 21:20:21,stocks,"I think you’re overstating the division between America and China. Politically the two are divided, but economically they are very connected. Tensions would have to dramatically increase for delisting due to political differences to occur. The current threat of delisting is due to the fact some Chinese companies have falsified their reports to appear better to investors. This is not an issue with massive companies like alibaba though so I don’t see this occurring.

But increased tensions would negatively affect any Chinese stocks. So I kinda agree."

Watch for more publicity surrounding the genocide, especially in Muslim media.

If you see an uptick in those types of articles, then you know the Five Eyes are activeoy working to undermine support / build anger towards China.

I suspect this will unfold over a number of years,  as the USA will need to separate its supply chain from China before taking formal action (wonder how much of the infra bill will cover that?)."

2021-04-09 20:29:03,stocks,"You can buy with unsettled funds, but you can’t sell something bought with unsettled funds until they’ve settled. The violation happens when you sell. It typically takes 2 days for funds to settle."
2021-04-10 07:59:49,stocks,Haven’t used TD in a while but I’m sure if you click on it it will say when it settles. I know schwab does. You can always look at your history too. If you trade a lot I agree it can get hard to remember which day you bought what.  It’s not too hard to get into a system. Basically don’t buy crap u plan to day trade with unsettled  if you see something you know you’ll hold for at least a week then buy it with unsettled. I know if I’m buying a very up and down stock I make sure it’s with settled cash as u don’t want it popping 50% and not being able to sell and take your profits
2021-04-09 22:11:09,stocks,A margin account is probably the answer for you.
2021-04-09 20:19:34,stocks,If you're selling your securities back that quickly consider options they settle faster you can sell em back the next day
2021-04-09 20:14:29,stocks,Just go to a cash account instead of margin and you don't have to worry.
2021-04-09 21:28:23,stocks,Thank you
2021-04-09 23:55:32,stocks,"You're normally allowed to buy with unsettled funds as long as you don't sell that lot before the prior sale settles.

They'll lock you out of buying before settlement as well."
2021-04-10 01:22:25,stocks,"OK, question. Do I have to wait until I have ZERO ""unsettled cash"" before I sell anything?"
2021-04-09 20:06:00,stocks,I very been breaking that T2 rule for a while.  Probably won't be doing it anymore but I am definitely considering transferring to Fidelity.
2021-04-09 21:33:56,stocks,"But wait, there's more.

Be careful about the wash sale rule. It is quite complexicated. It says that if you sell something for a loss and buy something similar within 30 days, it changes the way that you get taxed.

Also, first quarter estimated taxes are due on April 15th in the USA."
2021-04-09 20:38:39,stocks,"Yes this is the key.

Took me 3 violations to finally understand 🤣."
2021-04-09 22:02:20,stocks,"Yeah, I get it, but who's going to stop and do the math before they sell. At least not me :D"
2021-04-09 21:17:30,stocks,"The $25,000 rule does not apply to cash accounts. The only rule for cash accounts is you have to wait until funds are settled to trade, save for trading on good faith. 

The $25k rule applies to margin accounts only."
2021-04-10 03:30:02,stocks,"I think the 25k is total account value.  The requirements are outlines on TDA's page advertising the capability.

From https://www.tdameritrade.com/investment-products/margin-trading.page 

1. Open a TD Ameritrade account
2. Make sure the “Actively trade stocks, ETFs, options, futures or forex” button is selected
3. Fund your account with at least $2,000 in cash or marginable securities
4. Keep a minimum of 30% of your total account value as equity at all times"
2021-04-10 11:02:35,stocks,"Good advice, thanks!"
2021-04-09 20:30:10,stocks,"Cash account is what I have, unless I'm mistaken. I mean, it's not a margin account."
2021-04-09 23:57:20,stocks,"Well, I guess I'll just wait for funds to settle and take advantage of these lulls to plan my trades more carefully.  :/"
2021-04-10 01:30:56,stocks,"no.

if you buy a stock on unsettled cash, that cash needs to settle before selling that stock."
2021-04-09 20:30:02,stocks,This rule exists with every broker FYI.
2021-04-09 20:38:23,stocks,Its not a violation to buy with unsettled funds. It's the selling of a security you brought with unsettled funds that will get you
2021-04-09 21:59:47,stocks,"I hate that!  It changes my cost per share, it was messing with my brain until I heard it was the wash sale rule. Guh!!!"
2021-04-10 01:23:06,stocks,Did the authorities come and get you as others have hinted?
2021-04-09 22:14:45,stocks,you can avoid it by being a responsible trader and keeping your own ledger current...
2021-04-10 00:23:01,stocks,"1. Assume every trade takes the full two days.

2. Don't trade so much of your port so fast that you get close to the limit.

3. You've been given several free rides on ""good faith"" grounds. If you do it again it's simply illegal, and the penalties escalate. The authorities won't care that you find doing the math to be a burden or the website confusing, they will remind you that it's solely your responsibility and will rain damage on you. And your broker will protect themselves."
2021-04-09 23:56:22,stocks,Man! My karma is going down like my stocks after I buy them. Sad...   :/
2021-04-09 22:04:59,stocks,Which is why they will restrict your account and then you won't even be able to buy with unsettled funds.
2021-04-10 14:34:07,stocks,"You’re simply in denial about your responsibility. Honestly, your behavior is childish, that’s why you’re getting downvoted so hard."
2021-04-09 20:16:20,stocks,"Not sure why you're getting downvoted for sharing this.

Fidelity is really good about alerting me if I'm about to make a trade that could ever cause a good faith violation. Buying with unsettled cash gives the first alert, and trying to sell before that settles gives the second. Saved me accidentally making a GFV at least twice."
2021-04-09 21:24:40,stocks,Yea I think they meant go to margin account. Of course you're still limited on day trades if you're under 25k
2021-04-10 01:44:59,stocks,"Ok, I know I can buy with unsettled cash, but to sell, how do I figure it out? Do I just wait until my balance says zero unsettled cash?"
2021-04-10 01:01:43,stocks,"It's a federal banking rule, part of Regulation T, which defines how cash and margin accounts may behave with regard to creating money via credit (it's way bigger than that)."
2021-04-10 02:42:23,stocks,Not on RH
2021-04-10 01:27:58,stocks,The letters Fidelity mailed me almost make it seem like a serious offense! 🤣
2021-04-09 22:19:44,stocks,"You mean like create a spreadsheet?   TDA tells you the balances of unsettled cash, but they don't tell you which stocks are responsible for the unsettled amounts.  Does it not matter?"
2021-04-10 01:12:03,stocks,"TDA says they'll restrict my trading to settled cash only. How did you go and get the authorities involved in this?
Who are these ""authorities""?"
2021-04-10 14:32:54,stocks,Maybe take it as a hint that you should maybe know a little bit more about what you’re doing before you do it.
2021-04-09 22:15:26,stocks,"Yeah, that part I understand."
2021-04-10 14:39:46,stocks,Yup. Cool as a cucumber. I've been downvoted for lesser things.
2021-04-10 14:49:06,stocks,"I have asked before, not just now, what do I need to do. The PDT rule is easy, I don't break the PDT rule even though I have 3 freebies a week.  Which don't even matter since the GFV is more complicated. So, again, do I just wait until I have ZERO unsettled cash so I can sell any stocks?    Nobody has answered my question, but they sure feel like they can take a stab at me.  Nobody has even said what to do. What if I buy shares of a stock in 3 lots? Nobody has said what you do. So thanks for your higher than thou opinion. I'd rather be childish than arrogant."
2021-04-10 00:23:51,stocks,"You can still run into it there, it just takes ~~twice the~~ way more effort.

Edit: I checked the margin balance page in my account and the ""available to daytrade"" number is about 2.8X the account size. I can't find any combination of other numbers that produce it, either."
2021-04-09 20:31:15,stocks,Ah! A first alert would be nice.
2021-04-09 20:46:43,stocks,"I think some people on this sub get annoyed at people who don't know things. Not sure why. Isn't it better to learn here? Alternatively, we could all go learn elsewhere, but then what's the point of this sub?"
2021-04-10 05:26:13,stocks,Fidelity saves me from doing this like once a week. The purchase history of the stock is enough to avoid this. But it sure SUCKS not being able to sell a stinker w/o a GFA
2021-04-10 01:49:32,stocks,"switch to fidelity it’ll keep track for you and warn you before selling the stock if it’s been paid for or not. or simply keep track of it yourself if your broker doesn’t. 

remember “T+2 settlement” buy monday with unsettled funds, sell wednesday once it settles. t+1 for options"

2021-04-10 00:00:00,stocks,Is anyone anticipating some serious movement if Mexico legalized weed? Should I invest? I've been wondering how much that decision would affect the markets and which companies in particular would take advantage of this. Is it wise to make investments based around this political decision? I'm thinking Miracle-Gro or Grow Generation might be worth throwing a bit into.

2021-04-09 22:02:48,stocks,"Mexico would struggle, cartels are extremely powerful, and they won’t take kindly to legalization. Not that that isn’t a problem to some degree everywhere, but I’m betting more heavily on US legalization through MSOS, and then YOLO and POTX sprinkled in for good measure. I’m too lazy to do research on individual companies, but I’ve been watching this slow acceptance of Cannabis for 15 years, and business is already booming, even with a regulatory maze and lack of access to traditional banking; the pot industry is only going to expand."

2021-04-10 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, April 9, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, April 9, 2021**

Stocks traded higher in another record-setting session in the market. The S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow (DIA) both recorded new intraday highs and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) kept building on recent momentum. Market participants continue to digest remarks from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 

The equity market got a boost after FOMC members signaled in their March meeting that the Fed continues to favor maintaining highly accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future and signaling they will hold off on tightening policy at the first sights of inflation. Jerome Powell reiterated that the Federal reserve was looking for “actual progress rather than forecasts” to before the Central Bank considers tightening monetary policy. Moreover, Powell highlighted the uneven recovery in the US labor market as a sign the economic recovery still has a ways to go in order to meet the Federal Reserve’s employment goals. He said “The recovery though here remains uneven and incomplete. Tee burden is still falling on lower-income workers. The unemployment rate in the bottom quartile is still 20%. There are still eight and a half million people out of work. This unevenness that we’re talking about is a very serious issue.” 

Treasury yields have come back down some, hovering at 1.66% at the time of writing, as fears over a near-term policy shift by the Federal Reserve dissipated, prompting market participants to rotate back to growth and mega-cap tech stocks, with Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Facebook (FB) reaching new intra-day records. Colleen MacPherson, Penobscot Investment Management portfolio manager said, “We’ve seen this rotation into more value-oriented names from growth to value, but as we enter into earnings season, we anticipate growth names to see somewhat of a rebound because we expect strong earnings coming out of the growth names. But overall, I think the trend into value, small caps, more cyclical names will continue as the economy reopens and more people are inoculated and we get back to normalcy.”

Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season for the first three months (Q1) of 2021. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab said, “We’re still in probably the early parts of the expansionary cyclical after recovering from that recession. We’ve started to see cyclical trades playing a big role in the early part of the cycle. Normally what happens at this stage is you continue to see … the cyclical component will continue to drive leadership into the second part of this year into next year.”

2021-04-09 20:20:52,stocks,I was 35 and my one piece of advice is find a style that suits  your personality learn all about it and stick with that style....patience 😊
2021-04-09 21:00:41,stocks,"I started trading at 17. In March 1992, I worked at a Hess gas station in NJ and mailed off a $25 dollar check to JNJ asking them for a direct purchase of stock.   About two weeks later,  I got a receipt/ certificate for 1 and something shares.   I still have it around here somewhere.  Why,  because there's not enough anywhere else.   Pensions aren't enough (if you are lucky enough to get one), SSA benefits aren't enough (if even available) ,  and unless you are actively trading in a sizeable IRA or 401k, that's not enough either.   Folks, you need the stock market.   I learned that early.  My dad was an exec and JNJ, but died penniless.  He shouldn't have.    Invest in companies long term,  and you got a shot; otherwise,  you're working until the day you die. 

I have bought shares of good companies every month out of my paycheck (wherever I worked) since that March 1992.  In 2011, armed with a sizeable portfolio, I began option selling on my securities and a handsome silly of cash (all covered,  although I have the privileges and portfolio margin).  All in all,, It has been nice... sometimes exciting (like 2020 to 2021, 2018) and sometimes boring as hell (2011 to 2017ish).

Time and money, into companies that you believe in, and use.  That's it."

So I had to use the money to move house/settle up debts. Sucks, recently worked out my portfolio would've been worth 100k+ nowadays.

Now have a great family and a very supportive partner and two kids. So win some lose some right?

My advice would be start as soon as you can, invest at least 10% of your earnings, have a good retirement fund and emergency fund for hard times.

Stick to what you know and put 90% of your portfolio in to 10 - 20 low risk stocks."

Went on frugal backpacking trips pre-covid, watched enviously as the locals and other tourists dined lavishly. Meanwhile I was budgeting hard.

Came back home, looked at my bank balance. Still less than what I paid for my paper degree years back. Looked at housing market, I'll never be able to afford my own just working day in day out. Looked at parents, old age is catching up fast. All this while food prices have been incrementally increasing each year.

But then when I use stop losses I’m constantly dealing with bullshit stop loss triggers that end up being plays the would of turned profitable. 

Is this entire game rigged for anyone who isnt buying and holding long term?

It seems like there are times when prices just keep going up when they shouldn’t and other times where prices are just deflated in a ridiculous level. 

Any words of wisdom or tips?"

It's really just gambling against people with betting data and reaction times."
2021-04-09 20:35:53,stocks,"So if the trade is wrong I average down. My last year history with NAKD was like this, my entry was .60ish, they dropped all the way to .07ish and I average down to .10ish, when they rally to .2-.3 I got out with profit of 30k. 

Basically if you are wrong then you might as well just let it drop as much as possible and then double or triple down the position to reduce the average. I have done this to about 3 stocks and I came out with a gain even when they never hit back to my original entry point. 

I learn my lesson on not to sell for loss as I have a history of such in the past. This has strategy has allow me to have a profit of 115k last year and 112k this year.


Nobody is perfect at guessing the entry points but if we can average down with rescue funds then any shit stock can make profit for me. My other large profit is from hertz that went bankrupt last year."
2021-04-09 20:46:34,stocks,"How do you scale down? Like how do you pick which prices to average down at, just other support zones? And how do you pick how much money to put into it at each drop?

My problem is I don’t usually have reserve cash to average down with. 

Should I be trading just one stock at a time? And if the plan goes wrong just average down as much as possible and wait for the profit to eventually come?

I went from 39k to $100k briefly and back down to $33k. A lot obviously happened in between that. 

Today I was looking at the graph of my portfolio and was thinking maybe at this point I might as well just keep holding or average down. Because I only invested in things I believed in and saw value in so I’m not stressed about their future potential. 

I feel like as soon as I cut my losses at this point it’ll just end up going back up and I’ll be pretty much FOMOing"
2021-04-09 21:46:21,stocks,"Average down maybe the hardest thing to pin point, what I do is try for average down when it drops every 20%, but if stock is suffering a slow and long term drop then u need to wait til it stop dropping for a week or two weeks then you do a large double down. Mainly u should keep about 1/3 of your total fund to use as a rescue fund to help stocks that you are stuck in. I happen to have extra outside savings that I can transfer in to rescue the stocks that my original investment is stuck in. 

Highly recommend u don't play more than 3 stocks at once as it's hard to keep the eyes on more than 3 stocks.

Also do some research as long the company isn't going bankrupt or closing then there is no reason for you to not hold and wait for its recovery. Vast Majority of the stocks rises over time so time (as long u don't buy meme weirdo stocks) and patience is a must to get your trapped money out and maybe get a gain if you held long enough. 

I haven't suffered any realized losses with such strategy and at the end of year I come out with positive realized gain. If some stocks just refuse to turn around within given months then carry over to next year, wait on the side with more rescue funds, just wait til they are stabilized for another double down, you will be getting profits even if they never hit the original high of your entry point.


But do remember you need money to rescue your money and ignore the noises that's on stock forums telling you to sell for loses, they don't know your hand better than what you know."
2021-04-10 00:01:03,stocks,"But one could say cutting losses and finding a profitable trade right now might be a better use of time and money - but that’s easier said than done. 

I guess the benefit to averaging down is that you get to be invested in a company you personally believe has value, thus making it less of a shitty experience to baghold because you have more confidence in its return in price and hopefully an increase in price"
2021-04-10 13:56:19,stocks,"If you keep doing cut the loss and find another stock then it eventually come down to buy high and sell low, keep chasing that one stock that you hope would spike after you purchase. 

But in reality there is just as much chance of your existing stock would rally and give you a high return if only you sit on it a little longer. 

I have held through such stocks that was so beaten that many just sell for loss (ie buy high and sell low in play again) but eventually those stock rally and I came out with large profits for averaging down and being early for its rally. I never chase a rally, I will always wait for a rally instead.

Patience is everything for the stock market game"
2021-04-10 15:04:33,stocks,"That’s a very good point. I need to implement more scaling in and set profit taking points. And most importantly a reserve of cash for averaging my stocks down. 

Your replies have been very helpful man. Wanna exchange numbers or discord’s and keep in touch in general?

Bonus question: how does one manage risk with this kinda trading? If I only risk 5-10% of my account value per trade that helps limit risk. I guess additionally I could buy 5% at my initial entry and add up to 5 more percent as I average down as necessary. If it goes the right direction immediately then I get to take quick profit but don’t get to add more. 

This would also help keep additional cash reserves for the sake of averaging down. Thoughts?"

2021-04-10 07:55:58,stocks,"This is the best comment I've seen so far. But just to add in the EU you can no longer have a Holding Company based out of a BVI or any other territory that has 0% tax. 

What was happening was the Holding Company would lend the local company a shareholder loan and charge interst. The interest at the local level gets written off like you mentioned and then the Holding Company takes it as income without paying the taxes.

They also create management fees that they charge from the Holding Company to the local company which takes out even more income that can be taxed.

Right now these types of structure are prohibited in the EU. The tax rate of the Holding Company's domiciled territory cannot be less then 50% of the local country, unless they have a tax treaty, and all management contracts must comply with arms length rules, otherwise they charge withholding taxes on all transfers. 

Now Cyprus and Ireland are being used as Holding Company locations becuase their tax rates are the lowest in the EU at 12.5%. 

The solution you mentioned would solve so many of these loopholes and reduce expenses since they wouldn't have to open several legal entities (Holding companies) which each cost money."

2021-04-10 00:00:00,stocks,"AB InBev, Werner Enterprises to test Embark driverless truck technology San Francisco start-up Embark is partnering with AB InBev, Werner Enterprises, Mesilla Valley Transportation and Bison Transport to test its autonomous trucking systems.

Embark has raised at least $117 million in venture funding from prominent firms including Tiger Global, DCVC, YCombinator and Sequoia.

Werner Enterprises CEO Derek Leathers predicts that autonomous trucks will make jobs in ground freight better and safer for human drivers while helping carriers meet the rising demands of e-commerce growth.


Embark, a start-up developing driverless truck technology, is partnering with Anheuser-Busch InBev, Werner Enterprises and other major shippers and cargo haulers to make sure that autonomous systems work within the growing ground freight industry.

The start-up’s development partners get early access to the company’s software and services, according to Embark CEO and co-founder Alex Rodrigues. Embark will soak up the logistics giants’ operational expertise, and prioritize developing features requested by their companies and drivers.

When Embark started around 2016, it set out to develop fully autonomous trucks that it might sell one day, or use to create a driverless cargo-hauling service of its own.

Now, Embark employs about 120 full-time employees and has raised at least $117 million in venture funding from investors including Tiger Global, Sequoia, DCVC and Y Combinator.

It has used some of that money to build a “reference architecture fleet” of 16 autonomous trucks. Embark owns and operates these with human safety drivers onboard where required by state laws, and uses some trucks to move refrigerated and dry goods for paying clients.


While Rodrigues declined to discuss Embark’s paying clients, CNBC previously reported that Amazon, for one, has used Embark for some cargo-hauling on U.S. highways.

The start-up’s technology enables trucks to automatically merge onto or off highways, to stay in the center of a lane, make automatic lane changes, and navigate from highways on surface streets to transfer hubs. Their systems work in sunshine, rain, fog or at night but not in snowy conditions. A human driver takes over when an Embark-equipped truck makes its way to a transfer hub.

Over the years, Rodrigues said Embark shifted its focus, informed by experiences working with drivers, carriers and shippers. Rather than compete with cargo haulers, the start-up now plans to license its autonomous systems and software to them as a kind of high-tech force multiplier.

To that end, Embark recently unveiled what it calls a “universal interface,” a set of standard components (sensors and other hardware) that truck manufacturers can install for a customer and that enable Embark’s driverless features. The system can be installed in trucks made by all four major U.S. manufacturers, Freightliner, International, Peterbilt and Volvo.


How the rise in self-driving trucks will transform the trucking industry

Derek Leathers, the CEO and president of Werner Enterprises — an Omaha, Nebraska-based international logistics business with a $3.2 billion market cap — told CNBC that his company is partnering on development with Embark and hopes to use its technology to make drivers safer and make their lives and careers better over the long term.

“In order to satisfy the thirst for everything delivered tomorrow — freight and tonnage will continue to grow, along with GDP growth,” he said. “We’ll have a larger driver need in 2030, even with autonomous penetration in some lanes.”

Driverless trucks, he predicted, should eventually work well for the much longer, “middle miles segment” of shipments. Those long distances keep drivers away from their families for too long. If drivers can leave some of that work to autonomous trucks, and do more local and regional deliveries, pick up and drop off work, then they can sleep in their own bed afterward and be happier with their careers, Leathers said.

Besides Werner Enterprises, Embark has development partnerships with Mesilla Valley Transportation, a regional hauler in the Southwest United States, and Bison Transport, which is based in Winnipeg, Canada.

Carriers participating in Embark’s preferred development partnerships program operate more than 10,000 trucks combined.

2021-04-10 00:00:00,stocks,"Market crash mitigation? One a scale of 1-10, how stupid is it to sell my roth IRA funds (Vanguard, $30k in VTSAX and already maxed for the year) and keep it in the settlement fund so I'm relatively safe if the market crashes from say... GME?  I'd keep it in the settlement fund for a few months, and if nothing happens then I re-invest it.  If the market does crash, then I trickle it back in for the dips.  Since I don't have a lot on the line, I feel the like the opportunity cost isn't significant (I'm only 27, so plenty of time to make up a ~1k loss of growth), but the potential gain could be worth it.  Looking at what happened in 2008, or even the beginning of COVID, a crash does have noticeable effects on VTSAX.

I know that you can't time the market, so normally I wouldn't consider something like this.  But with GME doing its whacky stuff, and the possible effects it could have, I feel like this isn't a normal scenario so abnormal moves should be considered.

EDIT: All in all I don't plan on making this move, appreciate the feedback.  I still think the logic is sound, but yes, never know when or if the market will crash.

You're embarrassing.  You clearly lack finance education.  Ordinarily that would be fine, you could come here to learn, and I'd help.  But you came out of the gate as an antagonist, instigating misguided attacks driven by a lack of subject knowledge.  You, unfortunately, have disqualified yourself from being respected by making that choice.

> They just couldn’t pay out 

Ask your teacher (who is paid to put up with you) to explain to you what it means when you don't have the ability to meet your mandatory obligations.  Your attack on me is so profoundly ironic and embarrassing that if you weren't so malicious I'd pity you.  But your malice makes you an antagonist who doesn't deserve the pity.

> Melvin only lost 50% and the next month made most of that back, 

Wrong.  Ask that long suffering teacher how much you have to produce after a 53% loss in order to get back to even.  Hint: 40% doesn't even get you close.  Then have them reconcile that with the bailout.  Honestly, your aggressiveness mixed with proud lack of knowledge is too much.

> You haven’t done any work obviously! 

Peak irony.

> None of these companies debts ever exceeded their assets.

Your teachers deserve medals of courage.

In all seriousness, this could have gone so much differently if you hadn't made the active choice to be an antagonist and instigate wrongheaded attacks.  You could have said ""help me understand"", or ""what does insolvency mean"", or ""tell me how this played out?""  

But instead you took the opposite path, choosing - unprovoked - to attack, without understanding the topic.  Next time be a decent human and maybe you could learn something."

2021-04-10 00:00:00,stocks,"Thoughts on QQQM vs VTI? Planning on selling all my individual stocks for an all ETF portfolio. Much less stress and all around better for my mind, don’t have a lot of time to truly analyze stocks and make good choices haha. So here’s the breakdown I was thinking:

QQQM/ VTI 40/20%
QCLN 10%
VEU 20%
ARKK 10%

I like the risk / reward with QQQM, I’m 21 and have a long road ahead of me. But Reddit loves to tout VTI so I don’t really want to miss out on it, and on the third hand I feel they’re somewhat similar despite VTI having over 3000+ holdings and QQQM having ~100. The expense ratio difference doesn’t mean much to me, its only .12% and I don’t have much to start with. I would like to do both but not a fan of the overlap in holdings. 

What are your thoughts between VTI and QQQM for a 21y/o investor? Are my other choices solid also? Should I just drop everything in VTI and let that be my portfolio? Any help is appreciated, cheers"
2021-04-09 23:31:39,stocks,"QQQM and VTI are not close to the same...

VTI is a diverse total us market fund. While QQQM is tech heavy fund. VTI should probably be 50% pf your portfolio. 

QQQM/ QQQJ at your age are great tilts for a medium to high risk/ reward play. 

Check put SCHD too. One of my favorites

I dont think qcln will pay out as well as you are hoping.

Ark is risky and for me not worth a spot in my portfolio. 

This is mine and im in late 20s. 

VTI- 57.5% 

SCHD- 10%

2021-04-10 00:00:00,stocks,"Is Trade Ideas' Holly AI Worth It or Not? So, there are three bots for Holly today, they are Holly Neo, Holly Grail, and Holly 2.0.  When looking at their performance today.  Holly Neo seems to be doing the best so far.  Starting with $50,000 in Jan. 2019, today it's worth $84,484.33.  Which is about $17,242.165 a year, which is a 34% profit each year.  Now, this is not including costs for Total brokerage Plus, Trade Ideas Premium, and this amount doesn't include slippage.  Anyways, for subscribers to Trade Ideas Premium they are able to see more in depth results of Holly than the monthly performance shown only to the public.  Holly has three different strategies, conservative, moderate, and I believe best of them.  It used to be conservative, moderate, and aggressive, but aggressive was dismissed due to real uncertainty I believe.  So, it's probably unlikely that you will be making 300% a year using Holly.  But then I came across an interesting post on reddit that made me wonder how true it was.  It was from back when aggressive was still around and it was the third strategy.  Nevertheless, it was showing Total gains that possibly went from 200%-500% for some of the strategies, which really confused me.  So, I reached out to Trade Ideas and they were kind of confused as well.  The only thing they could think of why it was showing this was possibly because of risk.  My question to the more experienced about this is this.  Is it worth it and how do you think the Total gains went from 200%-500% for some of the strategies on that post?  Also, attached below is the link to the post that I mentioned throughout my post.  So, thank you very much for any advice you may be able to give me pertaining to this information.  Thank you and have a great day.

New CEO - Pat Gelsinger

They hit a slump with their cheap delays and manufacturing struggles.  Their previous CEO just does not have the technical pedigree to make critical decisions.   He has been replaced by Pat Gelsinger - a self made guy who put himself to school while working full time at INTEL.  Grew up in the farm, have interest at tech at high school, hired by Intel straight out of high school, went to Santa Clara for his undergrad while working full time, then went to Stanford at grad school.  Grew up in the farm while got that Farm degree.  Architected a chip himself, got forced out, hired as VMWare CEO where he tripled their value.  And now got rehired as Intel shot caller.  Remind me of Steve Jobs and his Pixar and return to Apple glory.   

As chip shortage is becoming a key source of economic leverage and national security, Intel is taking a great risk with $20 billion investment. Gelsinger is also meeting up with Biden on April 12 and definitely would received our government blessing .

Intel unlike their competitors will do both fab and designing.  The fab takes times but with our government backing and Fed money.

I don’t imagine democrats will take the senate in 2022, so many vulnerable seats for them... Biden will have to do amazing to keep it. And regardless, it seems like military stuff goes on under every president... and Lockheed Martin does space stuff that probably will be funded pretty heavy even if Dems keep a simple majority.

I’ve been pretty aggressively buying Walmart, since it’ll skyrocket if anything knocks down the house of cards Amazon is currently standing on. After watching Hasan Minhaj’s piece on them, I’m convinced that reigning them is bound to be politically popular, especially with the unionization votes launching all over the country now.

Amazon is facing democrats that don’t like their working conditions or anticompetitive behavior, republicans that see them as tech oligarchs censoring conservative voices, labor organizers determined to unionize multiple plants, businesses trembling in their boots that amazon will destroy them... and unlike places like Walmart, amazon is eating businesses that pay lobbying money. 

I’ll also note that I think Netflix’s current price-earnings is ridiculous considering all the competition they’re facing in the streaming market snd their failed attempts to expand internationally... I’m extremely tempted to take a short position, but I haven’t burst that bubble yet for myself.

I don’t know a ton about clean energy but I bought ICLN figuring i wouldn’t have a retirement to worry about if we didn’t get onto solving this climate crisis and making those companies make some fuckin money.

2021-04-09 23:12:27,stocks,"MORT is an ETF full of mREITs.

mREITs use 10X leverage to buy MBSs (mortgage-backed securities; mortgages tossed in a basket that gets chopped into small denominations and sold like bonds).

The Fed also buys MBSs, as a big part of QE.

Which is good for mREITs, as long as the situation doesn't change.

But sometime soon the Fed is going to reverse course and start selling MBSs, to soak up cash in the economy to try to moderate inflation. The excess supply is going to drive the price of MBSs down.

And since mREITs are 10X levered in MBSs, all it takes is a 10% sag in MBS prices to drive their margin to zero.

Just so you know.

Despite all his shortcomings, Xi has by and large done very well by the Chinese. China has many problems, but worrying about a middle class revolution is not one of them.

91% of the population lives east of the Heihe–Tengchong Line. Ghost cities are still relatively new and are a long term plan to address the disparity in population distribution as well as to empower and urbanize rural areas. Yes, these ghost cities exist, and yes, it is a peculiar phenomenon. Given the geography and other circumstances, I don't think it's realistic to expect these brand new cities to turn into fully functioning Tier 3 cities in a matter of years.

Yes, China is a communist country. So is Vietnam. China is a part of the WTO, WHO, UN, and various other international institutions. It is also a most favored nation to the US. Moreover, its most certainly and quite significantly interconnected with its American counterpart.

2021-04-10 05:14:39,stocks,"A big, big disclaimer here: I've only been investing for 2 months and I don't do options.

That said, there's been pretty big resistance around the 225 mark, and I can't imagine it dipping much lower than that.  We'd have to go back to March levels (covid-19) for that to happen, which seems unlikely.  This is very shoddy and uninformed technical analysis, but I could say that there's a good chance that it can only go higher than 220 at this point, even if it takes some time.

All the risks are still there, though.  If investors don't get over the political fears then who knows, it could hover at this price for a long time, ie, well into September.  That's the risk.  Nobody knows.  

So I see some risk with your play, but it's cool because it's less risky than just buying the shares themselves.  A lot of potential for upside by 9/17, and if nothing happens you just pay the premium and take a small loss.  Small risk, high potential reward.  As long as you're OK with losing the premium, looks good to me!"

There is nothing to support the notion that China has any plans to attack Taiwan or anything like that. China's power projection in the South China Sea has only partially to do with Taiwan, but there are many other factors at play there.

Based on your response, I'm assuming that you're not overly familiar with China. Ghost cities hardly rate as a problem. Hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty, China is the largest economy in the world when you account for purchasing power parity, and its at the forefront of making novel technologies accessible to everyone. China's literacy rate is over 95%; some 80% or so students go on to secondary/high school, and over 50% of those students go on to study at university. Believe me, there is little to no sign of a social fracture which threatens communism in China. A social fracture which would usurp communism in China is hardly a concern, nor would it appear to be even close to becoming a reality. The CCP was the vehicle responsible for all those achievements, and to Chinese, it continues to serve their interests well."

Do you deal with the correlation of your positions? So in case you are looking to add to your portfolio, do you pay attention to that? If so, where do you get the correlations/covariances from?"

So at this point if you can identify a publicly traded company in your state you could make an individual investment. But smarter move, if this is the strategy you're pursuing, is national suppliers for construction equipment and supplies."

When a huge dip like the nasdaq took here in the last couple months hits, you dam right I'm picking stuff up cheap and on margin.

2021-04-09 22:49:08,stocks,I’d hope anyone that uses margin is aware of interest like every other loan out there. Right now I’m paying 2.5% interest. Between the margin and cash it’s paying for itself.

2021-04-10 00:09:33,stocks,"I'm trying to address all the traders on here with 0% margin and how they could learn to be more financially literate, which includes responsibly borrowing money from the bank to put themselves in an advantage. If borrowing money is so risky why do banks, hedges and institutional traders borrow to invest? Why do we not hear about archego or lehman brother's every other day?

This goes for everyone: if you aren't willing to bet with someone else's money that your stock will go up faster than the interest rate, why did you choose the stock in the first place? Because someone said it's the next TSLA? GME? or that it is undervalued or oversold?

If you consider yourself to be a trader and not an investor, at least spend 15 minutes trying to understand how margin can be utilized by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqZKjn1tu8) before writing it off. In one of his videos, he goes into how when a stock sells off, you are de-risking your chance of getting margin called, and that would be the best opportunity to margin. To completely swear off margin is just about as barbaric as people trying to apply for credit cards and never use it because they don't know how to pay it off."

So the pay contract info was year one. Those same technicians now top out at almost $27 from annual raises and contact renewal raises after six and a half years. 

>For the grievance story, that manager would have been fired by the end of the day. No need for extra paperwork and procedure. It would have been on camera and Loss Prevention would have been all over that.

This doesn't dictate whether or not bullshit happens where employees are falsely accused of something without recourse. 
There are no cameras on the job sites for this company and the company doesn't want them because it allowed plausible deniability resulting in the company being able to come to its own, often faulty conclusions about incidents. 
Also the guilty manager is still employed at the company after multiple ethical and legal violations including disciplining a reservist for missing a shift because of his monthly weekend with the Army after the technician gave the manager plenty of notice about his duty weekend. He is besties with the area manager and is protected from on high as a result (the area manager was disciplined for not disciplining the first level manager after the reservist incident, but he is also still employed by the company). The technician from the battery and theft story didn't want to pursue further action (either with the police or within the company) against the manager for fear of retaliation and targeting. Shortly after the incident, the technician took a job out of state with a competitor. 

>I would have a vote just like every other hourly employee

I'm not going to completely disagree with this, but I doubt you would get a vote or be able to join the same union as the associates. This is because you have a different job title and likely a different work group. Whereas you interact with the associates, you are probably a manager in the union's and company's eyes. My former employer also has ""safety guys"" who basically monitored technicians for safety infractions, did accident investigations, and offered policy change suggestive to improve safety on the job. They are hourly employees, but are not considered craft; therefore, they could not join the technician union. If you can discipline or suggest discipline for an associate (for a safety infractions as an example), then you should not be allowed to be on the same union as the people over whom you wield authority as this would definitely pose a significant conflict. 

>Again, you have the wrong guy. You're assuming that since I'm not a bottom level employee that I'm some kind of corporate drone

I did make this assumption to some extent (I am sorry), but alas, aren't we all just corporate drones in the end? Go to work, do shift, go home, rinse, repeat.... Until vacation... 

I tried to unionize another position at my former employer and the first level managers (and some of the eligible employees) immediately started union- busting tactics claiming they ""would make life better,"" and ""we care about you""... It was bs as I knew, but the card check didn't go our, so the movement died locally. The union has since successfully organized  that same title on other address of the country and continue to work hard on behalf of the people who don't even know they need help (like Amazon FC employees). 

Remember- no matter how good it may be, it can always be better. examples:  
Fewer hours for the same pay. 
Lower healthcare costs. 
Defined raises. 
Cost of living raises. 
Grievance procedures (read job security). 
Better pay. 
Seniority. 
More PTO based on time served. 

The company will always fuck over its employees to support their top executives' lifestyles."

It does not have the same edge Apple has and had. 

People would own an apple product, which was the only 'luxury' and 'cool' tech brand that existed. Other tech companies didn't go for the luxury or cool angle, they focused on functionality. They marketed themselves that way. Tech nerds would salivate over functionality but mainstream consumers cared about the luxury. 

People can drive a sports/luxury car from Germany, Japan, US, Italy etc. Cars already have tons of history and showed up in culturally impactful movies.

In the same period, Tesla have racked up massive losses in every year until 2020. Apple and iPhone are way more profitable in the here and now and for a decade already. 

Led by Apple and iPhone, smart phones destroyed the non-smart cellphone market inside a few years, with sales of non-smart feature phones now less than 20% of total cellphone sales (smart + feature).

Having multiple chargers per location is not a moat, others can build bigger locations. Payment and bill procedure shouldn't be a moat but that's an easy one to fuck up so we'll assume the other companies have a harder time. I don't know what 'reliability' issues you can run into with a charger that plugs into a port. I've seen issues with cars failing to unlock the charging port but that's on the car (if not user error) not the charger and Tesla is definitely not exempt from complaints in that regard."

The main provider (in terms of importance) for rapids is Ecotricity as they have the Electric Highway contract with motorway service stations. Their route map is excellent. However, the problem is that they require app payment (no car link or contactless card payment), their chargers are comparably slow, their service centre is atrocious, and their units have terrible reliability.

With respect to reliability, yes, you'd think it was as easy as plugging in a port. It's absolutely not. Whether it is due to incompatibilities with different manufacturers' CCS implementations or just poor reliability from the rapid chargers, reliability of some of the non-Tesla networks is dire. Check reviews for rapids on Zap-Map if you don't believe me.

Faster chargers and multiple chargers may be points that other vendors can bring online. But they haven't, and they aren't, and they don't have solid plans to do so in the near future. Tesla had, by far, the largest truly rapid (100kW+) network in the UK before 2020. Thus far in 2021, they have installed more 100kW+ units that all of their competitors combined. The competitors can indeed catch up, but they aren't. And they don't seem to have the plans in place while the supercharger network is accelerating ahead, either.

I'm thinking about getting into a company, but it seems a bit strange to say the least. They also pay a 2% dividend. 600 million in free cash flow, and 90% institutional ownership. Are these institutions trying to stock up right now, or is there any good explanation for any of this. I just can't see a reason as to why its trading lower than its counterparts.

YES I’M SHORT & WILL MAKE A KILLING LIKE I DID LAST TIME THEY REPORTED.  


1. Most Importan -Membership program; 80% of the members got the service included for 1 year w the purchase of a device.  It was actually cheaper to get the camara w the membership than w/o.  This means no revenue has been collected & doubt most will actually pay for it when their trial is over. 
2. 30X PE nothing else to say about this crazy valuation 
3. Small Caps rallied hard and juice is about to run out (Rus 2K)
4. GOPRO went public in 1993 and in all these years they still aren’t profitable.  WHAT??? 
5. The so called CEO just last week sold 200K shares or $2.5MM.  Never a good sign when the captain of the boat sheds a significant percentage of his shares specially just a couple of week away from reporting earnings.  

Good luck if you are long not sure if this is just a broken company or a tragedy."

lets say it didn't work out...would the loss of 5k be a big, losing-sleep-over, thing for you? Are you financially stable enough to take that hit? If so, and you have the conviction, go ahead. If not, it might be too risky a move for you."
2021-04-10 12:38:57,stocks,"Yes, probably excessive. Some advisors say to never put forth more than 2% of your portfolio into one idea - others say 5%.  Why do leaps at this point, when the stock itself is cheap and you have no particular timeline as to when the CCP is going to ease up on stocks?"

I also think you're giving yourself a false sense of diversification if you're thinking 'diversified across the tech sector' = 'diversified'.

A portfolio with those 5 companies is more diversified than a portfolio that consists of 5 semiconductor stocks only, but is horribly undiversified when compared to the SP500."

I worked in legal US cannabis production for a couple years and in all honesty, buying weed stocks is no better than playing the lottery until these companies have outlets to proper banking and financing in the States. Even then, fees and red tape are going to be a large hurdle for any company to overcome. 
Not to mention the readily available supply of black market product. 

And on top of all that, some companies are getting hit with trademark infringement suits and threats due to the strain names. Gorilla Glue  is just one example but, they at least took a light hearted approach to the matter. Might not seem like much but, strain names are huge sales and marketing tools in the industry

A total stock market ETF would be diverse wouldn’t it? Lol they are also super insistent on finding stuff that works with the no tax part of IRA’s. I don’t think VTI would be that bad

2021-04-10 00:00:20,stocks,"Multi-Asset Portfolio 🌲 
————————————
Great ideas here but almost everyone is ‘thinking within the box’ There is no multi-asset diversification. If the r/stockmarket tanks you’ll get the poor fellow/lady killed again. 

Here is all you need for a mostly evergreen 🌲 portfolio ( just a bit of Florida winter ❄️):

VTI + VEU == Total world 🌎 equity
IYR for Real Estate
GLD + XME for metals
LQD, BWX, EMB for bonds and international currencies and yield

Add BLOK. XBI, IPO to keep it current 

Equal weights for each asset class (1/n rule).

For Level 2 players: Add 5% extra of the asset that is down 20% (rarity) sell that portion when it’s up 25%. Stop buying if it goes below 30%, it’ll not be worth the disarray. 

These are linked to 90% of traded assets on this planet and get diversified beyond just the stock markets. These are among the most liquid assets too. 

Every 6 months shotgun these with new capital. Sell equally if you need money. 

I’ve been running this since 2004, with 10%/yr but beta of 0.7 ( 30% less volatile  the SPY only)
Rule of 72 >> 72/i = n, ie in 72/10 years the portfolio will Double. 

Nothing against your fav assets but you can run a correlation vs these and yours at sectorspdr.com ( official site for SPY and select sector ETFs). Also calculate the max drawdown of a single asset vs this MaC Portfolio.

I think Carecloud is going to continue to keep growing. I don’t have a price target as I just think as they continue to grow revenues the stock will continue to grow too. This is a long term play for me, not a meme or pump and dump.

2021-04-09 22:48:28,stocks,Because of the risk. Have a risk management!
2021-04-09 23:09:16,stocks,"The best thing you do is to contribute as much as as you can on your 401k plan. It will grow tax free and you can select what fund you wanna allocate your assets in. My 401k is generating 10% consistently with some vanguards, ishares, and Fidelity’s own etf/fund. You can put some bonds in then and dividend paying stocks. In your early 20s, invest in aggressive growth funds or small caps. In your 30s you want to divide between growth and value since you will more likely have family and mortgage to take care of and you don’t wanna be too risky. In your 40s you can continue doing the same or increase your investment in bonds which are known to be safe with low but consistent returns. As you get closer to retirement, maybe put 10% to risky investments and put the rest to bonds mixed with govt and good Corp. 

Apart from the retirement investment, you can invest in  growth stocks and value stocks with good fundamentals. Day trading or swing trading might be good idea for people in their easily 20s. Day trading is not for everybody and most people fail; however, young people have plenty of time to recover from losses. I highly recommend people start paper trading before actually trading with money. Study fundamental and technical analysis. Education and experience is a must when it comes to trading. 

For those who don’t like investing in stocks and trading, look for real estate investment. Buy homes near attractions and use services like air bnb to rent them out. In a long term, the property will be paid off by the rentals and you’ve just earned yourself a free property."
2021-04-10 01:07:35,stocks,I believe in diversification of assets and investments. Although the stock market seems great right now it is a good idea to put a portion of your portfolio in different asset classes like precious metals and real estate.
2021-04-10 14:31:40,stocks,"Don't ever miss out on any 401K matching funds offered by your employer. I believe most of any savings should be put into a 401K plan (I personally like my age-based fund that manages risk as I get closer to retirement for me). I keep At least 3-6 months of income in cash savings for emergencies and/or opportunities. I only invest any other money in the market myself.

I think a lot of younger people are a bit spoiled by the markets but those that have been around awhile understand markets can go down quickly and can take years to recover. I remember having similar thoughts as the OP when I was young in the late 90's. The dot com bubble was being created and it seemed foolish not to put everything you could into stocks. I saw so many people lose almost everything when the bubble burst. Including my own 401K that eventually had to withdraw after a long layoff.

My father was looked at as a fool at work because his 401K wasn't invested in high growth stocks. Some of his coworkers had 7 figures in their 401K while he had far less in his because he invested in lower risk funds. When the dot com bubble burst much of his coworkers wealth evaporated. Many had debt (bigger new homes, vacation homes etc) they thought they could manage in retirement on their 7 figure 401K and either faced significantly adjusting their retirement lifestyle and/or working longer than expected.

My father retired early when he was offered a package while many others couldn't afford to do so. While my father was enjoying his modest retirement, many of his friends continued to work. A couple never saw retirement and many got sick or passed after only being retired a few years.

Take from that what you want...."
2021-04-10 01:24:48,stocks,"This is wise advice. One I practice. Think of the emergency fund as insurance. There is something called Murphys law. Whatever can go wrong will go wrong at the worst time possible. When Murphy shows up at your doorstep, he brings his 3 cousins, Broke, Desperate and Stupid. When youre broke, you make stupid, desparate choices. Murphy will never visit if you have your wealth insurance firmly in place. 3 to 6 months of BASIC living expenses.  Having a few bucks set aside for opportunities is also a great idea.  What if you heard that silver prices were going to spike by 500 % this year? Could you jump in to make a couple of bucks or sit on the sidelines...   All in in the stock market is foolish. Diversify your assets."

If you have faith that high-technology is going to see more growth over traditional industries for the next decades, because of the world we live in, Nasdaq can be a rational choice. It's still a rather broad index. If you have patience, I wouldn't consider it particularly risky.

2021-04-10 00:38:23,stocks,"He absolutely *is* wrong, as are you. A stock is just another asset class, like a house or a car or gold. It's less tangible, but in a functioning society where business and trade is still running well, ownership of those businesses absolutely does have value. And if you buy enough of that business, you can gain complete control of all its assets too (buildings, vehicles, machinery). If you think it has no value, you are either not educated on the topic or being intentionally ignorant. Further, you are probably not viewing stock as ownership of the business, but rather ""just a thing you can say you have that doesn't really do anything"".

The only scenarios where owning a business is worthless are scenarios where society as a whole has fallen apart (nuclear war, asteroid impact, etc.). And at that point, you aren't worried about your % return on an asset class, you're worrying about what animal you will kill for food."

If you don’t understand how human beliefs can shift on a whim (including on value) I don’t know what to tell you. Are you familiar with the stock market?"

Are you understanding any of this?  Nothing you have said past the first comment has much to do with the one thing I'm trying give you information on.  

Your point is valid.  It's very true.  Even in the link I posted they say the same thing.  Except for the reason.  At no point in this entire conversation have i said that prices were not rising.

Are you being obtuse on purpose?"
2021-04-09 20:30:59,stocks,"How is getting LESS for MORE money at the grocery store not inflation ? 

THAT'S THE DEFINITION OF INFLATION. 

Jesus H... Have you ever had an economics class ? 

The granola bar example is classic. You can also apply it to toothpaste, potato chips, etc... Most of it is disguised by the packaging. Look at a toothpaste box (crest, colgate)... The box is the same size but when you pull the tube out it's 30% smaller. It used to be a big tube for $2.29, now it's a 30% smaller tube for $3.49. LESS FOR MORE MONEY = INFLATION. 

The housing situation is supply and demand caused by the lowest interest rates in 50 years. Completely unrelated to consumer goods."

2021-04-10 13:02:57,stocks,"Archegos has an amazing track record, but no investor is undefeated. Bad timing. VIAC has amazing potential and he bet the farm on it. VIAC owns the most top 30 cable networks among viewers between ages of 18 to 49 and 9 of the 10 original series with kids between 2 to 11 years old. The Company generated $2.2 billion of operating cash flow from continuing operations and $1.98 billion of free cash flow. As of Dec. 31, 2020, the Company had $3 billion in cash and $3.5 billion in revolving credit that hasn’t been tapped.

It just went the wrong way at the wrong time and he got margin called. It provides a good buying opportunity for VIAC for the retail investors at these prices. There are PTs in the 100s still and it’s in the low 40s... crazy."

This is a serious side effect that has a  distinct negative effect on the  quality of life of many cancer patients  – even when the chemo is  effective.

2021-04-10 02:00:20,stocks,"Yes best in its unique form, its the only vaccine that does not use MRNA technology like Moderna or pfizer, instead it uses a whole virion virus-which can prove more effective against many variants. Realistically we will know in a couple of months as the results come out but for now we know that moderna and Pfizer both failed to treat the new varients and will require boosters."

2021-04-10 15:43:22,stocks,"VOO follows SP500.  VTI as its name implies is a total market index fund.  

They’re weighted a little differently as one uses obviously the sp500 and one use the entire market.  

Some years you can be ahead using the sp500 and some years you can be ahead using the total market.  

There’s a lot of articles that can give you percentages that show how they (unless you have a billion dollars this doesn’t matter) fluctuate +\- 2% in a single year SOMETIMES.

IMO if I had to make a bet on which would pay off when there was a crazy market trend....it’s Tech....hence VOO.

Neither is a bad choice. HODL."

I even said sometimes VTI outperforms VOO.  

Also I think I make mention in another reply that if tech stops being a main force in the SP500 then the allocation would change meaning VOO adjusts with the market. 

Look for an arguement elsewhere."

2021-04-10 04:23:44,stocks,"Lol technical analysis isn’t used to ‘predict’ which way the market will go, it helps provide indications of the ‘probabilities’ of which direction the market may go. 

How much experience do you have? Are you a newbie, a intermediate or a professional investor or trader? 

Edit: I went to look at your profile and to be honest you just didn’t apply technical analysis right. Lol.

You’re also applying the wrong indicators on the wrong trend. 

You can’t just apply any indicator to any chart, that’s not how it works..

there are specific indicators relative to what you’re trading wether it be equities, options, currencies or indices and specific indicators for an up trend, down trend, or ranging, or going through a retracement or reversal etc."
