&#x200B;

Opendoor is only down because shorts are targeting Chamath and Cathie in my opinion. Earnings should really break this trend.

I'm in for 300 shares, 5 $30 calls for 2023."
2021-05-03 18:55:04,wallstreetbets,Real estate market is gonna crash hard again.  2008 X2
2021-05-03 19:00:31,wallstreetbets,If cathie’s in I’m out. Everything she touches lately turns to shit.
2021-05-03 19:46:19,wallstreetbets,Only issue. They are buying houses at super inflated prices right now. Billions in inventory. What happens when the market dips ...? They will be selling homes at a loss and they go out of business immediately.

2021-05-03 19:23:34,wallstreetbets,Sailpoint is undervalued and so is Rocket Mortage. Open might be as well.

2021-05-03 19:06:51,wallstreetbets,"Why? 2008 was caused by a lack of funds, defaulted mortgages loaned to low credit individuals. Right now we have an excess of funds all across the board, the dollar is being devalued and it raised the price of hard assets."
2021-05-03 19:02:08,wallstreetbets,After doing +208% in 2020. Ironic.
2021-05-03 19:03:59,wallstreetbets,"The only Tracy I know used to be a guy. Still is, but he used to be one too"
2021-05-03 19:11:44,wallstreetbets,People are making more money on paper. Not in reality. Most people don’t know how to handle the influx of funds. Loans have been handed out to lots of irresponsible people with money for the first time

2021-05-03 19:30:40,wallstreetbets,I'm a livestock producer.  The rest of my family is grain.  Commodities is where it's at across the board.  Predicting crop prices is really risky.  I don't get into the marketing end of livestock or crops.  But there is inflation and catalysts for increased corn prices.  If you get in and make a profit be happy and get out unless you have really solid info that you can continue to make $s.  I've seen a lot of people pour money into ag when it's making big money only to get their ass handed to them at the back end.

Cheers to the king of the Midwest 🌽 and thanks for the DD, looks pretty solid to the few wrinkles in my brain"
2021-05-03 19:46:14,wallstreetbets,Corn has been a big winner for me this year. I also have a small farm in the south and can say it’s been a very dry spring which is a rarity here
2021-05-03 18:19:18,wallstreetbets,Wonder what happens when the weather starts acting up? Mother nature causing hyperinflation confirmed?
2021-05-03 19:08:59,wallstreetbets,"Don’t corn futures involve taking delivery of the underlying commodity....?

Asking cuz I don’t need 100,000 bushels to show up."
2021-05-03 19:29:40,wallstreetbets,"Inflation is creeping up and not many people are paying attention. CORN is an easy way to gain exposure to this, options are dirt cheap right now."

Someone needs to do a black knight meme about this stawnk."
2021-05-03 18:15:26,wallstreetbets,"This is going to be PLTR 2/16 all over again. So much hype and fomo, it'll beat top and bottom, then tank 7% AH. Best of luck retards."
2021-05-03 18:42:53,wallstreetbets,"There is likely going to be a bit of a spike post earning.. always are (check chart)... then it will settle into a new baseline top and bottom resistance. (likely $25-27)

Last earnings it went up from a baseline of $18-$20 to now $21-23. 

So grab some quick bucks and then use that to buy stock for the next earnings cycle. Rinse and repeat each quarter. 

Maybe it's not GME returns, but it's something you can made good consistent money at to feed your catch lightning in a bottle get rich quick shots."

2021-05-03 19:27:14,wallstreetbets,Every other comment I see on here says everything always goes down right after earnings.
2021-05-03 19:40:17,wallstreetbets,What kind
2021-05-03 18:34:37,wallstreetbets,"In 10 seconds, one can do a google search and find that RKT went public less than a year ago. What makes you think you’re smarter than a 5th grader?"

2021-05-03 19:11:53,wallstreetbets,"It went to $40 because of the special dividend, not earnings."
2021-05-03 18:42:13,wallstreetbets,I must not be. I’ll delete my comment. Im pretty jaded when it comes to WSB. It’s not what it used to be.
2021-05-03 18:30:48,wallstreetbets,It means that he’s about to get shafted post ER
2021-05-03 19:17:10,wallstreetbets,Agreed. Losing is the only way to win here...
2021-05-03 19:46:30,wallstreetbets,they let some people in already to test it
2021-05-03 19:56:10,wallstreetbets,gib rocket
2021-05-03 19:17:02,wallstreetbets,They declared the dividend because they made so much freaking $$ and the price was being unjustifiably held down by shorts. So they nuked it from orbit with the divvy. No reason they wouldn't do the same again.
2021-05-03 19:17:33,wallstreetbets,Don’t forget that lovely gamma too.
2021-05-03 19:27:03,wallstreetbets,"They might announce another one, but the $40 jump came weeks after earnings just prior to the ex dividend date."
2021-05-03 19:36:02,wallstreetbets,not to nitpick but the jump came 3 days after earnings when the shorts had to cover (gamma happened partly due to the big special dividend announcement).
2021-05-03 19:43:02,wallstreetbets,"Feb 25 was last earnings, rkt cleared $40 on 3/2. Just to be clear I’m heavy in on rkt, and bullish on it. But dates are very important when talking about options trading and if you are looking at purchasing weekly calls based on what happened with rkts earning report last time, understand that it didn’t jump directly after the report."
2021-05-03 19:48:43,wallstreetbets,"Yea 3 “trading” days later. Me too, love me some RKT. I’m sure I won’t see the 900% like last earnings on my options but really bullish for earnings and beyond! 🍻"

2021-05-03 17:45:05,wallstreetbets,"The nok hype is without a reason AGAIN yeah they beat earnings by 700+% but the expected eps was so low any company would have destroyed it 0,8 is still average if you look at the past earnings"
2021-05-03 18:35:30,wallstreetbets,"Without a reason????? L O L 

Look man... there’s so much reason I can’t even bother to explain it. You haven’t taken the time to do your DD then don’t invest but this NOT a short squeeze or a GME clone this is a real undervalued company. If you don’t see it then just keep moving. We don’t need you causing some sort of anti NOK conspiracy. I’ll post a legit DD post here maybe tomorrow so that all the people like you can finally see the big picture.. stay blessed"
2021-05-03 18:07:17,wallstreetbets,"Some people have legit lost their life savings, they made a telegram support group and hearing so many sad stories on there. Lol I mean some of them are stupid and memeing but you can't help but feel bad for the genuine ones.

2021-05-03 17:30:43,wallstreetbets,People are so dumb 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️😂that was a clearly a scam
2021-05-03 18:17:55,wallstreetbets,"What the fuck??

2021-05-03 18:57:13,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it's nuclear.  There are so many bios that are undervalued.

  
I can't believe this subreddit isn't discussing the XBI for biotech as it's what causes plays like CLOV and other bios that are short to not fully squeeze.  You cant create prolonged gains without the bio sector etf XBI doing well.  The sector is 100% short right now, meaning the pigs are tanking biotech R&D and companies share prices are dwindling and they will be unable to raise the necessary funds to complete research.  It's so fucked.

Every single day, you will see the XBI tank from short selloff. Then magically, at 4:01 PM, a $100 million dollar cover comes in dark pool. I assume it's the same on XRT.

Spread the word on this....needs to be an actual squeeze there.  I don't know what their endgame is.  I think it's the open interest on the $135 Puts.

You could also sell cash secured puts on RKT right now but for that strategy I would wait until after earnings. If they somehow miss on earnings, the CSP would be a great way to benefit.

Think about it this way.. would you want to establish a short position on RKT that probably only has the maximum downside of 1-2 dollars (support at 20$ very strong), or go long with nearly infinite upside? There are better opportunists right now in the marketplace to go short on genuinely bad companies with little to no earnings / fraud type companies..

2021-05-03 17:01:55,wallstreetbets,"Response to this.  No position either way. For Intel,   I do know however that as you increase your technode you must increase your equipment technology.  20 B for new Fabs is not an eye shocking number and anyone who knows semiconductor companies knows this.  

Look at the foundry TSMC majority of output is in Taiwan with only 2 8-inch wafer facilities in the USA.   8 inch wafer facilities are money losers, you spend the same amount to produce them as a 12 inch wafer, but netting less chips, industry current standard or 300 mm or 12 inch.  Those fabs wont be around much longer and they will eventually need to be retooled, and most likely completely rebuilt.    

Why building in the USA will be so important in the future.   

Look at Taiwan and Singapore two places China would love to control.  Let's say tensions with China intensify and a skirmish or war breaks out there.   There would be a strangle on a lot of chip manufacturing.  Pay attention to trouble brewing in the south china sea.  

If Intels fabs are up and running they would continue to build un-harrassed in the USA.   

I agree that any time a company takes money for capital expenditures when it is running behind is risky. TSMC IS SPENDING 25 TO 28 BILLION THIS YEAR ON CAPITAL EXPENSES.  Samsung  is spending 28.1 billion this year. The reason Intel is producing more fabrication facilities is so that is can have more capacity which it does not have access to currently.  So the numbers being thrown around are normal for the industry.   

I would have to agree in the short term intel is behind and it will take time for them to get back up.   I do however believe they will be much better positioned going forward.   Their stock already looks discounted. 

Just remember semiconductor companies are always playing texas hold em.   They have to put tons of money upfront and then hope everything works out to stay profitable.   Loss of power, interuptions in supply chain i.e. south china sea, would be devastating to any company producing there.  

The only thing that would push intel higher right now would be an announcement of more capacity,  upgrading to 450 mm wafers, or some new advanced processes that blows away the competition.   They are making more capacity but that yield will be 18 months or more out.  Not a bull or bear hear just my two cents."

2021-05-03 18:02:29,wallstreetbets,"I am bearish on INTC, however, they do manage to pull profits somehow every quarter despite AMD. They have a current opportunity in the short term to take some market share from AMD with the current GPU shortage. They are coming out with their own GPU, which will sell like crazy, even if it is complete garbage. All on Intel processors have in built graphics, which run decent. AMD's chips don't have any of that. Considering no one can buy a GPU right now, if I was building a pc and didn't have a GPU, I would have to go with Intel to even use my computer, and once you do that, you won't change your CPU for a couple years at least.

Another factor, Intel is changing their chips, along with AMD, to dividing 8 cores into 4 small efficient and 4 large ones. This is similar to what ARM chips does. They also are coming up on 10 nm, hopefully without any delays. They have a CEO in charge who is an engineer from the early stages of the company, the are coming out with a 7nm TILE design, similar to AMD's chiplet design, and also did I mention how much cash they have? 5 billion in raw cash. You can do a lot with that.

Not to mention its very dangerous to have a concentration of foundries in Taiwan, and yes TSMC is building one in the US in a couple years, but a lot can happen.

I think Intel is at high evaluation for what is happening, but don't bet against the giant. Both AMD and INTC are giants now. It's a fools game, without a catalyst."
2021-05-03 17:21:54,wallstreetbets,"You are not wrong, however, apple didn't really develop a new cpu. They bought a architectural license from ARM (technically: NVDA) and got a bunch of support to build this chip for a really nice fee. So Intel lost to ARM not to apple. A lot of ppl here forget it is not Intel vs AMD, it's 3 parties (all the other alternatives basically hibernate or have died)

Also, x86 was really nice for intel, but they had to buy AMD64 licences from AMD to get into the 64 bits market. Intel lived a very long time because of FUD.

Intel has been in trouble since 2017, when it turned out their [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative\_execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_execution) was causing security issues. Even though AMD had \~50% of the same problems (since they where part of the architecture) ARM had none.

2021-05-03 18:48:48,wallstreetbets,Technically it's not worth 1.2 mil. It'll appraise at the exact same amount...you'd have to find a sucker to pay 300k more than the last loser who paid 950k.
2021-05-03 16:28:22,wallstreetbets,90% of Americans have no idea what specific interest rates are at any given time.  50% don’t know if they are low or high.  Rates have been so relatively low for such a long time its background noise.

2021-05-03 17:39:27,wallstreetbets,Thoughts on ASO’s secondary stock offering/share repurchase announced in AH today?
2021-05-03 17:14:32,wallstreetbets,"I think your onto something. I go to academy almost weekly and it always busy, always sold out of ammo and their prices are fair. I like it"
2021-05-03 19:24:42,wallstreetbets,"In ASO since $17, great play. I also like citi trends(ctrn) for similar reasons, lower end, small but fast growing footprint."
2021-05-03 16:36:09,wallstreetbets,"lol ok so 'Guns' and 'Clean Energy'

you cant really compare ASO to DICKS when ASO is literallyy only in the southern, eastern half of the country, and dicks is literally everywhere"
2021-05-03 16:33:32,wallstreetbets,This is so fucking dumb. Your bags are heavy eh Steve? ASO’s price action after their earnings release was pathetic. Take your bags and go to r/ASO
2021-05-03 17:29:48,wallstreetbets,I’d pick TAN / QCLN / or ICLN over CLNE
2021-05-03 16:21:12,wallstreetbets,ASO has peanuts for volume lol much worse AH

2021-05-03 16:56:06,wallstreetbets,"I apologize, you are obviously a big fan of Dicks so I prefer that you get what you like."
2021-05-03 16:54:18,wallstreetbets,"Yep, you really took a lot away from this post 🤣"
2021-05-03 17:03:49,wallstreetbets,It's kind of funny. I really hope your reddit account isn't a direct reflection of you because all I can see is downvoted bullshit all over your post history.
2021-05-03 17:09:37,wallstreetbets,"Check out the news, looks like KKR is executing a secondary offering of 14M shares and Academy is buying back up to $100M of those shares."
2021-05-03 17:23:36,wallstreetbets,"I just think both of your picks are gonna be relatively slow movers.  CLNE might get back to 15-20$ end of year so good on that I guess but ASO is garbage with high short interest and some guns & is Not a smart pick for a Biden re-opening..

You also would be better of with TAN or QCLN or ICLN. .  CLNE is kinda a garbage etf for clean energy."
2021-05-03 17:42:34,wallstreetbets,Hi retard. If you think I take the internet seriously you’re mistaken
2021-05-03 17:53:08,wallstreetbets,Did you actually read anything in the post? CLNE is not an ETF and it's so strange to see somebody talk shit about something they clearly know nothing about while also making price predictions... 🤔 Why is ASO garbage? Where you think they get most of their sales? You think they're driven by their very limited gun selection?
2021-05-03 17:35:29,wallstreetbets,CLNE is not an etf?
2021-05-03 17:45:48,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, well I didn't mean to single you out with all the references to your sex life. I shouldn't have aired your business out like that."

2021-05-03 17:13:01,wallstreetbets,"Cathy lured me into DKNG, she will be right eventually"
2021-05-03 17:13:13,wallstreetbets,Something about not being a loss until you sell...
2021-05-03 17:13:22,wallstreetbets,"You are rich dude, that's propably nothing to you."
2021-05-03 17:14:56,wallstreetbets,"DonkeyKoNG!!!

2021-05-03 17:15:30,wallstreetbets,Threshold pass
2021-05-03 17:15:54,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-03 17:16:49,wallstreetbets,It’s not a loss if you gain membership.
2021-05-03 17:17:19,wallstreetbets,#oof
2021-05-03 17:17:55,wallstreetbets,"Are you going to actualize the loss and exit or hold? if hold, then till when? Serious q"
2021-05-03 17:19:17,wallstreetbets,Hold tlry for few years. You’ll be fine
2021-05-03 17:19:45,wallstreetbets,"You mean 200k in reverse gains. I am not sure we can accept your application, you still got 571k to go. We have standards we have to maintain."
2021-05-03 17:25:41,wallstreetbets,"Looks like you got $104,988.14 left to go before it becomes official loss porn territory, application denied"
2021-05-03 17:27:14,wallstreetbets,You are home now
2021-05-03 17:28:24,wallstreetbets,I’m glad I’m not the only one disappointed in draft kings. They have so much good shit going for them too
2021-05-03 17:28:42,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-03 17:29:11,wallstreetbets,I've been hating this stock. Every time the company makes moves the price drops. It's as if the market has already priced everything in.
2021-05-03 17:29:24,wallstreetbets,"Ouch! 
I’m an active sports bettor and have used all the online apps- DK has the best interface for sports betting.  That does not help dropping $200k - you will get back and then some!"
2021-05-03 17:34:30,wallstreetbets, You’re holding shares and stocks eventually go back up
2021-05-03 17:37:15,wallstreetbets,"Me thinks you're in da club, bruh"

You’ll be fine 🚀"
2021-05-03 17:39:23,wallstreetbets,You’re a donut king
2021-05-03 17:39:31,wallstreetbets,N-ice hold on until the the seasons start back up. It going to be your retirement if you can hold that long.
2021-05-03 17:40:41,wallstreetbets,At least it's not options?
2021-05-03 17:41:06,wallstreetbets,"Lol. I was in and out for about a month. Fortunately, only lost about 1% in total. IMO, the percentage of the action will never be high enough to be a blue chip performer long term."
2021-05-03 17:41:56,wallstreetbets,Why?
2021-05-03 17:41:57,wallstreetbets,$DKN-ANUS
2021-05-03 17:43:01,wallstreetbets,Soon as college and nfl opens season that’s going to pick up especially toward the end of the year win everyone betting on bowl games

2021-05-03 17:44:43,wallstreetbets,Damn y’all are terrible at stocks
2021-05-03 17:45:34,wallstreetbets,I’d say those are some solid long term holds.
2021-05-03 17:45:35,wallstreetbets,Just Hold you idiot
2021-05-03 17:47:38,wallstreetbets,"Oh my, all hail the true Draft King."
2021-05-03 17:47:47,wallstreetbets,Tilray is going to be fine. You're just in TOO early. They only just announced their merger.
2021-05-03 17:49:26,wallstreetbets,Damn
2021-05-03 17:52:37,wallstreetbets,Lmao!
2021-05-03 17:52:49,wallstreetbets,My $1000 loss hurts as bad as that 200k.

2021-05-03 17:59:04,wallstreetbets,"I argue no. This is only 14% of your investment in this position + it's shares, so just hold it?

nah man, i don't mind people flaunting their cash, but gtfo with this pussy-ass post."
2021-05-03 17:59:41,wallstreetbets,This is always the way
2021-05-03 17:59:57,wallstreetbets,If you didn’t buy DEAC then you missed it
2021-05-03 18:00:27,wallstreetbets,You’re good. Hold Dkng for earnings and longterm you’ll likely be above cost with the upgrades it got. Holding at 58 @ 500 shares
2021-05-03 18:01:08,wallstreetbets,"You are holding shares, you gonna be just fine."
2021-05-03 18:01:20,wallstreetbets,I don't even make 200k a year lolmao
2021-05-03 18:01:43,wallstreetbets,Those Chris Sain money plays are devastating sometimes

2021-05-03 18:03:30,wallstreetbets,"Damn I’m still making money on tilray, I originally invested in it years ago on Cashapp. Have no way of figuring out my average besides math I suppose"

2021-05-03 18:10:05,wallstreetbets,WHO TOLD YOU TO BUY TILRAY?!?? Fire them and also rob them back of your losses!! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
2021-05-03 18:10:47,wallstreetbets,"As someone with 10k shares of TLRY at 25.50, I feel your pain."
2021-05-03 18:12:03,wallstreetbets,"I'll post something constructive unlike the hundred other shitpost comments:
You have 10000 shares. Why don't you sell 100 OTM weekly covered calls and collect premium. Once they expire worthless use the proceeds to buy more DKNG shares to lower your cost basis."
2021-05-03 18:13:33,wallstreetbets,"Well Tilray is down, for now ... but that is HIGHLY expected to come back and go up. 

Draft kings? Idk haha"
2021-05-03 18:13:38,wallstreetbets,I think you have it down now. Welcome!
2021-05-03 18:15:23,wallstreetbets,earnings are on Friday.. do you see all these shitters betting on sports these days? Diamond hands you ape 🦍
2021-05-03 18:17:18,wallstreetbets,At least these are shares.  They will probbaly rebound and this will become gain porn within a couple months
2021-05-03 18:18:56,wallstreetbets,Do you also live in your parents basement? 20k loss is the shallow end of the pool and you have to wear waterwings at all times.
2021-05-03 18:19:00,wallstreetbets,You were better off gambling on the DKNG app than gambling on the stock.  Probably a better probability of coming out ahead!
2021-05-03 18:20:41,wallstreetbets,Costco will let you return anything. Try there.
2021-05-03 18:20:48,wallstreetbets,How do you all have a casual 600k to put in stonks and laugh when it all disappears? I can only aspire to be like this
2021-05-03 18:22:34,wallstreetbets,Can you load a previous save point or check for a previous auto save point? I mean you could also try turning it off and then on again
2021-05-03 18:23:25,wallstreetbets,Buy gme only
2021-05-03 18:26:04,wallstreetbets,"And nudes to admins 🙌
But $200k is a good start"
2021-05-03 18:28:29,wallstreetbets,shares in dkng? this isnt impressive.  That shit will be printing money later this year.

2021-05-03 18:29:36,wallstreetbets,"All my screenshots are losses, what should I do it for the meme. Besides, if you are cool with pavement/sidewalk running. Personally I think 100 and humid isn’t concrete, and when they re-emerged - when the Enterprise visited a planet that had been blown up by twitter hot takes & rumors. Granted, I'm not buff nor have a full beard or tattoos"
2021-05-03 18:29:44,wallstreetbets,Nice
2021-05-03 18:32:26,wallstreetbets,Double that DKNG down
2021-05-03 18:34:55,wallstreetbets,How high do you thing r/tilray is going to go? Any thoughts on when the US will legalize?

2021-05-03 18:39:39,wallstreetbets,You didn’t lose if you didn’t sell.
2021-05-03 18:40:42,wallstreetbets,"mehhhh , i feel worse for the guy who bought 5000 all in lol you’ll be fine."
2021-05-03 18:40:52,wallstreetbets,It'll cost you your sanity as well! Welcome!
2021-05-03 18:41:18,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip!
2021-05-03 18:42:10,wallstreetbets,There are only two companies I'm absolutely sure about. One is GME. The other is DKNG. You are in great shape with DK. Just relax and enjoy the ride that's sure to come. DK to sports betting is like Google to search engines. They will dominate market share and you will not be disappointed.
2021-05-03 18:44:31,wallstreetbets,How would DraftKings grow? I played enough of it in 2016 to learn it was rigged against the average player that year and haven’t had the slightest motivation to play it ever since.
2021-05-03 18:47:46,wallstreetbets,Nice
2021-05-03 18:48:38,wallstreetbets,Hold!

2021-05-03 18:58:53,wallstreetbets,"It only costs $10,000 USD per the WSB Content Guide. Since you can't read or do math you're definitely welcome here."
2021-05-03 18:59:10,wallstreetbets,"This actually is a good hold. Long term. Dont sell it. This isnt retard status yet, might actually be smart."
2021-05-03 18:59:21,wallstreetbets,"DKNG, ah, Donkey Kong. Surprised it isn’t doing better with all the monkey talk."

2021-05-03 19:05:29,wallstreetbets,Damn the CDL  not allowing DraftKings logos to be visible is really effecting them huh
2021-05-03 19:06:21,wallstreetbets,But when this one hits it is going to be amazing. Draftkings is the next wave.  I'm holding on to this myself.

2021-05-03 18:24:46,wallstreetbets,How did someone so smart get so much money?
2021-05-03 17:10:15,wallstreetbets,Just Hold
2021-05-03 19:41:33,wallstreetbets,Oooh tell me about the calls what did you buy
2021-05-03 16:37:58,wallstreetbets,Recklessly investing is the only reason I have this type of money to recklessly invest. It’s a brutal cycle (circle?)
2021-05-03 18:27:30,wallstreetbets,"No you won’t lol, once you hit big #’s you want more. At one point, I thought $100k was a lot, and when I finally hit that mark, I was super happy, but then I realized it ain’t shit and I needed more. $250k hit, and I was happy for an hour, then realized, I still needed more. $500k hit, and suffice to say, I still am not satisfied. The only way you could be truly “happy” with money, is if you have enough to live peacefully off your dividends, so at least $1.5M+, at least, for me."
2021-05-03 16:15:20,wallstreetbets,It hurts pop. I’m cold.

2021-05-03 15:38:24,wallstreetbets,You're an idiot. There are two screenshots.

2021-05-03 16:24:53,wallstreetbets,I find losses much funnier than winnings. But sure
2021-05-03 16:54:17,wallstreetbets,But I wanna be a gambler 😒
2021-05-03 15:53:07,wallstreetbets,Easy peezy lemon holdy
2021-05-03 16:43:18,wallstreetbets,Didn’t know that was an option. I’ll get that done later.
2021-05-03 16:09:25,wallstreetbets,You ain’t wrong
2021-05-03 16:12:14,wallstreetbets,"Is it, though?"

2021-05-03 16:47:41,wallstreetbets,You complete me
2021-05-03 16:48:54,wallstreetbets,Soooo go all in? Foot on gas? More options? What are you sayinggggg
2021-05-03 16:50:05,wallstreetbets,The tide shifts at the moons lowest. The pen is mightier than the losses. Or something like that.
2021-05-03 16:53:59,wallstreetbets,"I have my hand on my holster. When I feel it in my gut I’ll pull that trigger.

2021-05-03 17:15:34,wallstreetbets,I actually don’t like her.
2021-05-03 17:15:53,wallstreetbets,Hold till zero. I’m on it captain.
2021-05-03 17:16:24,wallstreetbets,I make my dollars one dollars at a time too
2021-05-03 17:17:17,wallstreetbets,Worth it
2021-05-03 17:17:58,wallstreetbets,You’re bold
2021-05-03 17:23:15,wallstreetbets,Oh you did say serious. So honestly I see both in “super growth” sectors that in 5 years should continue to grow aggressively ( sector wise) and I do believe these companies will come out top 3 in their respective sector. So unless something major changes fundamentally I’m in a position to hold and create long positions. Also fuck with theta shit in the meantime.
2021-05-03 17:18:40,wallstreetbets,For-ev-err (sandlot)
2021-05-03 17:23:34,wallstreetbets,Democrats made me do it
2021-05-03 17:24:28,wallstreetbets,I eat ramen. My friends think I’m poor. Which I am.
2021-05-03 17:26:22,wallstreetbets,"Two pictures, swipe left. Duh"
2021-05-03 17:28:05,wallstreetbets,I feel home
2021-05-03 17:31:44,wallstreetbets,Yeah which is fine short term. I honestly think they’ll come out on top and the leader in the sector. They spend a ton of money and have been very aggressive. Sector will boom over the next 5 years. So I’m fine holding
2021-05-03 17:32:29,wallstreetbets,I think they’ll come out on top when the dust settles in a couple years. They are the most aggressive.
2021-05-03 17:34:56,wallstreetbets,That’s why I wanted to enter my application quickly.

2021-05-03 17:41:28,wallstreetbets,That completely Depends if my bookie can find my new address.
2021-05-03 17:42:15,wallstreetbets,So you’re saying there’s a chance
2021-05-03 17:44:10,wallstreetbets,I think they’ll find ways during the lows to maintain a steady income. Solid gripe though. If I didn’t think they’re going to be # 1 in the sector in 3 years I’d be out.
2021-05-03 17:44:18,wallstreetbets,Why not
2021-05-03 17:44:28,wallstreetbets,Is that a virus
2021-05-03 17:46:18,wallstreetbets,Yeah expansion in general will help. I’m hoping they can establish their gaming casino to be consistent and top 3 in the sector. Roulette/ blackjack never sleeps.
2021-05-03 17:47:03,wallstreetbets,Gotta lose money to make money. Erh....I think? Wait is that not what they say?
2021-05-03 17:47:17,wallstreetbets,What’s a stock
2021-05-03 17:48:16,wallstreetbets,My friend
2021-05-03 17:48:33,wallstreetbets,Oh. Ok
2021-05-03 17:50:41,wallstreetbets,Awh shucks guys y’all too nice
2021-05-03 17:51:40,wallstreetbets,I mean I think they announce in January but yeah I started eating edibles to help with their revenue so should be good
2021-05-03 17:53:46,wallstreetbets,Ramen all around! On me!

2021-05-03 17:59:34,wallstreetbets,They’re in the Bahamas at the moment and requested to not be disturbed.
2021-05-03 18:00:13,wallstreetbets,Super Nintendo version is the goat.
2021-05-03 18:01:13,wallstreetbets,But but but my tilray is down 40%😭😭😭

2021-05-03 18:11:15,wallstreetbets,Why would I ever realize a loss? LOL

2021-05-03 18:21:23,wallstreetbets,I didn’t know that. Closest one is 350 miles. I’ll drive there in the morning.
2021-05-03 18:21:49,wallstreetbets,Because the 600k came from here (wallstreetbets)
2021-05-03 18:24:07,wallstreetbets,I actually threw my phone in the river. Went for a new one. Same fucking loser account.
2021-05-03 18:30:07,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you

If a ghost bear shits in the forest though and no one smells it. Did he?"
2021-05-03 18:30:48,wallstreetbets,Sell at a loss and cry into my pillow!?
2021-05-03 18:32:09,wallstreetbets,If only my brain worked at the level yours does. Sadly. It does not and I have no idea what the fuck you’re talking about.
2021-05-03 18:33:26,wallstreetbets,Sir yeah sir!
2021-05-03 18:38:45,wallstreetbets,I hope/think legalization happens within Biden’s first year. If and when it does legalize and tilray is market leader in a booming sector I don’t see why it can’t trade 15-20x revenue.
2021-05-03 18:39:10,wallstreetbets,0-42. I’m due for a W!!!!
2021-05-03 18:39:26,wallstreetbets,Been there. Done that.
2021-05-03 18:40:02,wallstreetbets,I think dkng will come out on top when the dust settles in a couple years. But who knows. Shooters shoot
2021-05-03 18:40:14,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-03 18:40:35,wallstreetbets,Brick by brick
2021-05-03 18:41:19,wallstreetbets,True. Just wanted to join the club before I reversed course.
2021-05-03 18:41:34,wallstreetbets,May he Rest In Peace
2021-05-03 18:41:44,wallstreetbets,Don’t have any of that
2021-05-03 18:42:34,wallstreetbets,Agreed
2021-05-03 18:48:09,wallstreetbets,"Well it’s much bigger than just their daily fantasy sports sector now that gambling is becoming legal in many states. So, before they only had “ daily fantasy games” now they have actual gambling and the DraftKings casino app ( blackjack/roulette/casino games). More and more states are allowing the actual sports gambling and casino app games, so it’s quite the growing market."
2021-05-03 18:48:39,wallstreetbets,Hey man thanks! Nice stache
2021-05-03 18:51:55,wallstreetbets,Amen

On the other hand, OP could get lucky (based on his post it seems unlikely lol) and the stock could drop further and he could increase his position for the same cost and potentially deduct the original loss and then profit."

2021-05-03 15:38:17,wallstreetbets,I just got off that ride. The ticket cost me $150 even after selling covered calls and averaging down for 2 months. I'm retarded so if it turns around maybe ill play with fire twice.

2021-05-03 19:39:00,wallstreetbets,[Look into covered calls](https://youtu.be/jnTsQBJHMSk) you could be selling 600+ contracts a a month OTM and collecting some sweet premium

You have 80,000 call options for ACB 24c?

2021-05-03 18:33:03,wallstreetbets,Buy more but wait till there done with the lawsuit settlement
2021-05-03 18:33:19,wallstreetbets,They are getting sued. For violations of federal security laws
2021-05-03 18:34:27,wallstreetbets,"When I dip, you dip, we dip💎🙌🏼💪🏼🚀"
2021-05-03 18:38:21,wallstreetbets,Keep chasing it’s the quickest way to zero
2021-05-03 18:46:46,wallstreetbets,It's plug it stays in.
2021-05-03 19:11:26,wallstreetbets,"I bought 61 shares back in July for around 9 bucks. I wish I sold it in January when it was at its peak ($73) but ended up selling it for $26 per share. Hope you get back your money. They are projected to hit $35 this year.

&#x200B;

edit: added some words"
2021-05-03 19:28:58,wallstreetbets,Cut your losses quickly options loose very fast same happened to me today
2021-05-03 19:36:06,wallstreetbets,That's how you play though
2021-05-03 19:42:40,wallstreetbets,Username doesn’t really check out op
2021-05-03 15:47:02,wallstreetbets,This is the way

2021-05-03 17:22:03,wallstreetbets,I just dumped all my PLUG today. Waiting for the bounce
2021-05-03 17:56:50,wallstreetbets,I dumped this fucking shit. The goofy accounting told me to run
2021-05-03 19:12:59,wallstreetbets,Your only choice is to hold here...for a long time.
2021-05-03 15:01:20,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that on top of accounting errors and their inability to timely file their 10k, I figured the stock would be mooning"
2021-05-03 16:41:40,wallstreetbets,"You know what they say, bad news = stonk goes up. Good news = stonk drops"
2021-05-03 15:26:43,wallstreetbets,Holy shit i thought it was shares til i saw this and realized thats his daily lost. This kids gonna get fucced
2021-05-03 15:11:34,wallstreetbets,Update: I bought more.
2021-05-03 14:44:12,wallstreetbets,You know this might just be stupid enough to work
2021-05-03 14:44:33,wallstreetbets,"Yes.  If OP buys puts, your shares will work out for you."
2021-05-03 17:30:27,wallstreetbets,my plug puts and ICLN calls are hoping they rebalance and dump a lot of plug. but wtf do i know?
2021-05-03 15:42:11,wallstreetbets,True plug is an interesting stock lol. -7% today then +10% tomorrow wouldnt even be weird for it
2021-05-03 18:23:27,wallstreetbets,Even a falling knife will bounce when it hits the floor
2021-05-03 15:05:16,wallstreetbets,Seems bullish
2021-05-03 17:06:32,wallstreetbets,I added 70 more $29 5/21 calls. I don’t need your negativity around here goodbye 👋
2021-05-03 17:19:42,wallstreetbets,Gotta buy them all!

2021-05-03 19:54:15,wallstreetbets,"Terrible move. Plug is going back up, patience"

2021-05-03 16:21:31,wallstreetbets,Did it dip more after you bought more?
2021-05-03 19:18:37,wallstreetbets,Ill go all in on puts
2021-05-03 16:30:25,wallstreetbets,This is a DD i can respect
2021-05-03 14:45:35,wallstreetbets,"Nah I mean everytime I buy puts they climb. I buy calls it dips.  Y’all should pay
Me to know what I bought."
2021-05-03 16:30:46,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. You are near a strong support around $25. Being 2 weeks out from expiration, I think you will be fine."
2021-05-03 19:51:04,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, dead cats too."
2021-05-03 18:12:56,wallstreetbets,agree. bought a few 29calls for end of may. down about 40% but just waiting out the storm.
2021-05-03 18:09:20,wallstreetbets,Stronger together
2021-05-03 16:40:01,wallstreetbets,Surprisingly not yet I may have actually bought a dip
2021-05-03 19:20:32,wallstreetbets,Plz do
2021-05-03 15:06:11,wallstreetbets,What you buy?
2021-05-03 15:51:25,wallstreetbets,Now to prove my point I just bought a apple call for 5-14. $134. Watch and see.
2021-05-03 19:50:35,wallstreetbets,Er this week...He is about to get fucked hard.
2021-05-03 18:02:26,wallstreetbets,Then you're buying the dip wrong :/
2021-05-03 15:49:05,wallstreetbets,Nio calls
2021-05-03 15:49:32,wallstreetbets,At 930 this morning. Imagine that.
2021-05-03 19:08:19,wallstreetbets,He didn't but enough dip
2021-05-03 16:52:29,wallstreetbets,You see potential to reach in the 200s or in it for the long haul? Thank you
2021-05-03 14:00:20,wallstreetbets,🚀
2021-05-03 14:50:12,wallstreetbets,I still wanna know who bought that block share at 25$ I feel like it was for this earnings without having to disclose
2021-05-03 17:00:16,wallstreetbets,I for one would really enjoy seeing RKT back on the list of frequently discussed tickers.  It's been too long since I last saw it in last place or better.
2021-05-03 18:58:13,wallstreetbets,"Crushing earnings does not = 10x Dickbagger (See recent AAPL ER). 1st time it caught Suits & this time they are prepared.  Not to mention 🌈🐻’s are on call killing spree lately.  

Accordingly, I talked to Melinda & asked for permission 2 load up."
2021-05-03 14:15:32,wallstreetbets,Think it’s going off again? I could use another rocket burst
2021-05-03 15:19:59,wallstreetbets,"fyi they are actively growing in terms of [linkedin employees](https://contora.ai/ticker/rkt#linkedin_employees). I noticed that they began to grow even before everyone started talking about them. For some reason, everyone misses this moment, although its quite important indirect indicator of the company's growth"
2021-05-03 19:00:52,wallstreetbets,I threw another 100 dollars into my RKT dumpster fire. I still believe but I wish I had cashed out in March.
2021-05-03 16:09:51,wallstreetbets,"Lets Fucking Go. I have loaded the fucking boat at 25c, 30c, 35c. All we need is buying volume and this fucking thing is going into orbit quick. THIS. IS. THE. WAY."
2021-05-03 15:17:38,wallstreetbets,"Just loaded up more, ready to ride it up then sell CCs at the top, or die trying."
2021-05-03 13:59:26,wallstreetbets," March had high short interest, and a special dividend around the corner. Volume will be RKT’s only friend this time around unless they announce a quarterly or some kind of partnership (Dan gotta give up some shares ASAP) I’m long rocket but I wouldn’t play earnings under the current circumstances."
2021-05-03 16:21:50,wallstreetbets,Thanks for adding comments to finally understand the gains.. just smooth brained ape here
2021-05-03 16:22:11,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-03 19:46:47,wallstreetbets,Strapped in and ready
2021-05-03 15:00:39,wallstreetbets,"Assuming/Implying this will play out like the last time is a *BAD ASSUMPTION*

- Was some amount of short interest

- Special Dividend

- Lotsa volume

No special dividend this time around and nowhere near the same amount of short interest.  

I'm sure they will have good #'s, but it is not going to translate into another $40/share jump."
2021-05-03 15:24:50,wallstreetbets,"I’d be happy if it hit 24, I bought deep ITM calls for 5/7. 20c x 15 for 5/7 22.60 BEP"
2021-05-03 17:13:10,wallstreetbets,🚀
2021-05-03 14:54:21,wallstreetbets,I love RKT...but never buy before earnings and hold when its after market my friend....maybe pre market with money your willing to lose
2021-05-03 13:30:05,wallstreetbets,And miss out on GME?  Fuk no
2021-05-03 13:37:45,wallstreetbets,"🤣🤣🤣


This will tank after earnings."
2021-05-03 16:57:38,wallstreetbets,If I can just get rid of these $24 bags thats all I want
2021-05-03 17:06:22,wallstreetbets,"RKT won’t go up. This is a great company btw, but I just think your money can be better utilized elsewhere. Literally around the same price since its IPO"
2021-05-03 14:41:41,wallstreetbets,"Bad call

!remind me 1 week"
2021-05-03 15:43:17,wallstreetbets,You saw what happened to LoanDepot today? .... hang onto yur britches. may be in for a bumpy ride!
2021-05-03 17:09:42,wallstreetbets,In march u had gamma squeeze and it happened before dividend and earning report. So i wonder how u re detecting another gamma to happen?
2021-05-03 17:50:21,wallstreetbets,The first one is free
2021-05-03 18:01:35,wallstreetbets,Remindme! 4 days
2021-05-03 18:26:12,wallstreetbets,So this is what options look like? O.o
2021-05-03 18:56:50,wallstreetbets,now just imagine if you werent a pour when you did the first bet...
2021-05-03 15:40:22,wallstreetbets,"symbol: MTL-  

There is a cyclical spike and dip for this company for the past year that seems completely predictable. Is this easy money? Somebody intelligent please inform my why I'm wrong. Can't I just keep buying the dip over and over?"
2021-05-03 17:43:20,wallstreetbets,Fuck rocket and their views
2021-05-03 14:52:57,wallstreetbets,JESUS lez get all the gme posts back
2021-05-03 16:54:00,wallstreetbets,Good. Get above 25 so I can move on to something better. Gonna do pmcc on baba for july.
2021-05-03 14:22:58,wallstreetbets,Do u mean 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-03 15:00:04,wallstreetbets,100%
2021-05-03 18:53:31,wallstreetbets,Or it was a part of the 1B buy back that hans't been disclosed yet.
2021-05-03 18:55:23,wallstreetbets,Was this a dark pool print or some other trx? Got a link to details?
2021-05-03 19:31:39,wallstreetbets,"Is Apple UNDERvalued? Rocket makes Billions in profits and its treated like a spac. If everybody bought one share of rocket, watch what happens to the price. There are large holders manipulating this stock. Volume will overcome that. Theres a reason every time it gets activity it goes sky high."
2021-05-03 17:52:32,wallstreetbets,When do ur calls exp? I’m gonna go heavy into them tomorrow. They’re likely printing cash with the hot housing market right now
2021-05-03 14:03:23,wallstreetbets,I'm expecting guidance to improve at the very least. Low mortgage rates prolonging the life of the refinancing market. Also expecting that they'll want to show strength following the UWMC debacle.
2021-05-03 16:43:51,wallstreetbets,Lol np
2021-05-03 15:12:08,wallstreetbets,Share repurchases. We don't know how many shares have been repurchased. Float and EPS could be significantly affected by that.
2021-05-03 15:01:22,wallstreetbets,It's options... it's all money I'm willing to lose.  That said... it's also turned into the fastest money I've ever made... so theres that.
2021-05-03 13:47:10,wallstreetbets,I'm still holding my gme shares!
2021-05-03 13:47:36,wallstreetbets,Only if they're really good!🤣🤣🤣
2021-05-03 13:46:50,wallstreetbets,When is earnings ?
2021-05-03 15:06:46,wallstreetbets,"Unless they do some other special announcement.

Like, we have accelerated buyback and the float is 50% of what it was, so our earnings have doubled."
2021-05-03 17:52:02,wallstreetbets,"A stock with a clear floor, high volatility spikes and weekly options is the perfect stock to sell covered calls on."

2021-05-03 17:40:08,wallstreetbets,"I'm guessing there'll be another announcement of some sort... partnership, dividend, etc."
2021-05-03 19:07:24,wallstreetbets,No doubt... you should've seen my 0 day GME calls that I sold for double when it started to rise the first time.... still sick to my stomach about those.
2021-05-03 17:53:54,wallstreetbets,"Bro, you alright?"
2021-05-03 14:26:27,wallstreetbets,"No, but technically 🚀🚀"
2021-05-03 19:30:25,wallstreetbets,no it was a sale
2021-05-03 19:59:18,wallstreetbets,I’m pretty sure retail owns gme float 5times over and that barely does shit to the share price
2021-05-03 19:39:58,wallstreetbets,Check out the cost distribution which has an average of  $34.19 & therefore many holders underwater.  Gonna be hard to stop them from selling & thus keep price suppressed
2021-05-03 14:07:33,wallstreetbets,"I’m not saying earnings won’t be good, I’m saying no one will care enough to jump on board.Dan has to give up shares and rkt has to pay a quarterly div. I would love to see rkt announce a major partnership - I can’t think of any other reason Dan is holding on to so many shares."
2021-05-03 15:07:54,wallstreetbets,"I think the UWMC debacle could help this time.

We will also get numbers on share repurchase, which would improve EPS as well."
2021-05-03 16:12:37,wallstreetbets,lol no way he already owns most the shares
2021-05-03 18:08:42,wallstreetbets,I thought they were barely over the threshold for Russell inclusion.
2021-05-03 15:06:31,wallstreetbets,I get it brother I hope you get the tendies ...I really need to go all in with options its always a smart play with the way things have been last year or so
2021-05-03 13:58:05,wallstreetbets,Wym lol
2021-05-03 14:19:41,wallstreetbets,They will be good. But the forecast is not so good
2021-05-03 14:18:17,wallstreetbets,Always sell before earnings lmao
2021-05-03 13:49:24,wallstreetbets,Wednesday
2021-05-03 18:19:59,wallstreetbets,I agree
2021-05-03 18:53:48,wallstreetbets,I like the way you think
2021-05-03 18:45:23,wallstreetbets,"That would be nice, I personally think there will still be time to get in after the announcement if that's the case."
2021-05-03 19:24:09,wallstreetbets,"Oh god, was that the Friday before shit went nuts? I had 2 calls I should've exercised but instead sold before close for a quick buck."
2021-05-03 18:23:40,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m great!!! They did some pretty shitty shit to a friend... so I could care less if they went belly up....
2021-05-03 14:16:00,wallstreetbets,"I get the sense that something good is on the horizon.  Even if it doesnt get announced on the earnings call, a partnership could be announced the day after.  I like it when that happens."
2021-05-03 18:55:10,wallstreetbets,That was UWMC.
2021-05-03 14:19:05,wallstreetbets,"Nah, buy calls!"
2021-05-03 13:50:47,wallstreetbets,So 5/7 calls ?👀
2021-05-03 19:27:38,wallstreetbets,Yup
2021-05-03 18:35:22,wallstreetbets,You should let your friend know about this call opportunity... really stick it to the man.
2021-05-03 18:39:57,wallstreetbets,Well don’t hold your breath... they making mad profits lol.
2021-05-03 14:17:02,wallstreetbets,I can appreciate your enthusiasm - rkt 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-03 18:56:03,wallstreetbets,Ahh my bad. I see them discussed together so much I can't keep them straight. I think that's why I bought both.
2021-05-03 14:07:31,wallstreetbets,You got it. Swipe right on that picture.
2021-05-03 18:50:26,wallstreetbets,Why would I do that?
2021-05-03 14:08:56,wallstreetbets,Why did it go up to $40 last time ? What’s ur prediction the price will go earnings day ?
2021-05-03 14:14:18,wallstreetbets,I think it hits at least 30 before end of week.  If it hits 31 it'll trigger a squeeze with all the outstanding calls becoming ITM.
2021-05-03 14:17:20,wallstreetbets,Keep in mind last spike wasn’t until 5-7 trading days after previous blowout earnings report. I’ve bought may 21 calls just to be safe
2021-05-03 14:48:59,wallstreetbets,there was a special divy payment that broke the option chain because every call got a dollar in value
2021-05-03 14:15:19,wallstreetbets,Ouu I just purchased $26 calls for this week at .20 hopefully it does hit $31 so it can squeeze 🚀
2021-05-03 18:38:07,wallstreetbets,"Or they could just short it to let everything expire OTM... MMs have gotten smarter, they realize the buying pressure is temporary and the influx of OTM calls are free money."
2021-05-03 14:18:21,wallstreetbets,Hmm good thought will 5/14 calls work ?
2021-05-03 16:12:54,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-03 14:51:03,wallstreetbets,Think it could happen again or get near $40?
2021-05-03 14:16:40,wallstreetbets,You and I both.
2021-05-03 18:42:58,wallstreetbets,!remindmeneverimgambling
2021-05-03 14:21:32,wallstreetbets,"Potentially! But if you’re scalping options resale value is increased when expiration date is farther out. My earliest call expiration for RKT is May 21st, do with that what you will LOL. If buying power is tight you might straddle the expiration dates, 50% cheap May 7, 30% more costly May 14, and 20% expensive May 21sts"
2021-05-03 16:15:59,wallstreetbets,"I like 5/21 for a safety net but 5/14 will print. the 5/7 should hit, but maybe not over 26. I do expect fireworks for some reason. I think this is the blowout quarter. Q4 is holiday time and Im in real estate, there has NEVER been a busier Q1. Low inventory has not kept sales volume down, its kept inventory down.....BECAUSE EVERY FUCKING HOME IN THE US IS BEING PURCHASED IMMEDIATELY. Im expecting a big win here TBH. We will know soon."
2021-05-03 19:07:03,wallstreetbets,Ape knows push button get mortgage 💰🚀
2021-05-03 15:21:06,wallstreetbets,more like 80
2021-05-03 19:01:53,wallstreetbets,LOL!
2021-05-03 14:23:18,wallstreetbets,Welp I purchased 5/7 $26 calls and 5/21 $26 calls as well lol 🚀💰let’s hope for the best
2021-05-03 16:25:55,wallstreetbets,Well I own some calls for this week I might sell those and buy 5/14 and I own some 5/21 calls what’s ur price prediction for RKT ?
2021-05-03 15:33:13,wallstreetbets,Ur joking lol
2021-05-03 14:25:47,wallstreetbets,Best of luck brotha! A toast to our tendies 🍻
2021-05-03 16:14:55,wallstreetbets,rocket to 80 and then hold the line at 60. imagine a 2 dollar divy
2021-05-03 14:27:15,wallstreetbets,Same to u 💰also it’s forming reverse head and shoulders so maybe there’s potential for something this week 👀
2021-05-03 14:28:31,wallstreetbets,Price just entered the top of the buy zone starting under $22.32 so that should be confirmation somethings about to blow 👀🚀
2021-05-03 14:29:54,wallstreetbets,I see that it’s currently sitting at 22.45 I remember my first ever option play was on this in March and I made my first $1k I was hype af now I’m hoping it happens again👀
2021-05-03 15:54:33,wallstreetbets,This was my first options play too LOL I had 4 contracts and would have made 5k if I’d sold at the top. Unfortunately I didn’t. Entering round 2 but with 24 contracts this time 🚀🚀
2021-05-03 16:13:12,wallstreetbets,What’s ur strike price and expiration
2021-05-03 18:03:16,wallstreetbets,"Various strike prices from 22.5-40, but all expiring no earlier than May 21st.

2021-05-03 13:59:04,wallstreetbets,They haven't even had stock available for 10 years my guy. And their 5 year totals are (+271%). And not to mention there was a significant dip recently. So yeah I'd say it's a great buy.

2021-05-03 17:30:37,wallstreetbets,Yea tbh I can understand that lmaoo but what I don’t understand is why u bought so high knowing it was down earlier. Also have u ever had a job? Bc rn I’m picturing you as Bill Gates’ son
2021-05-03 17:22:52,wallstreetbets,"Yes, at least. For comparison, you can check the charts on Pinterest and Enphase. Normally after a gap down it will keep falling for a few days. There are many reasons but it’s mostly because any fund that wants to eliminate its position cannot do it in just one day."

2021-05-03 18:39:30,wallstreetbets,Well I don’t mean Twitter specifically but trading in general knowing the risks lol I know even if you lose you can pull out but having that much money casually on Robinhood is like wow. Like you can hire an actual person to invest your money for you that’s how much u have lmaoo
2021-05-03 19:02:24,wallstreetbets,I don’t think any money manager would be willing to take the risks I prefer. Scared money don’t make no money
2021-05-03 19:12:11,wallstreetbets,"I guess so, after all you seem to like the adrenaline. I would personally lose hair being in your position, even when you’re green lol but I guess it’s just spare chance for you so it’s okay"

2021-05-03 14:00:10,wallstreetbets,Why 2 weeks ? Isn’t earnings Wednesday?
2021-05-03 14:44:18,wallstreetbets,It got looped in with the spac crash. Opendoor is taking market share and crushing competition right now. They will beat the earnings estimates for Q1 and Q2.
2021-05-03 14:56:52,wallstreetbets,I would like to read too
2021-05-03 16:58:05,wallstreetbets,"options are down right now, because it was a red day overall. Lots of activity on 5/21 22.5C, 25C, 30c, 40c. Lots of volume on options for a red day. Something is happening."
2021-05-03 14:30:32,wallstreetbets,Why?
2021-05-03 14:20:20,wallstreetbets,They will print soon
2021-05-03 15:24:20,wallstreetbets,August $28 here
2021-05-03 17:00:48,wallstreetbets,"It means there are a lot of people thinking Opendoor can see a nice increase in the next couple weeks. The stock was beat down after announcing Q4 earnings (COVID), and then got beat down again in the spac crash but the company itself is doing good volume and making better margins. Housing market is on fire."
2021-05-03 14:16:14,wallstreetbets,I think earnings are 5/11
2021-05-03 16:32:06,wallstreetbets,Where are your sources they are crushing competition ? Last time I checked Zillow and Redfin are the winners in this marketplace?
2021-05-03 15:30:58,wallstreetbets,I hope your right I just went all in!
2021-05-03 16:15:51,wallstreetbets,Hey man are you sure because I went all in
2021-05-03 14:54:05,wallstreetbets,👍🏽

2021-05-03 14:27:36,wallstreetbets,May 30c here  =(
2021-05-03 14:16:55,wallstreetbets,I’m hearing it’s on Wednesday
2021-05-03 17:25:09,wallstreetbets,Opendoor is the leading ibuyer. They do 4-5x the volume of Redfin or Zillow. Redfin and Zillow are websites/real estate brokerages with a portion of the business dedicated to buying homes and reselling them. The only reason they are in the business is because Opendoor was taking over.
2021-05-03 16:24:05,wallstreetbets,"I’m betting on it with you. I’m confident they will deliver results. The stock has been beat down badly. It’s impossible to guess this market right now, but at under $20/share currently there is insane upside potential. 

It went up 11% in 3 days before getting beaten down again last week. The whole market for tech stocks was red from what I saw today."
2021-05-03 14:43:22,wallstreetbets,Investor relations on their website shows 5/11 @ 5pm est

I can't believe this subreddit isn't discussing the XBI for biotech as it's what causes plays like CLOV and other bios that are short to not fully squeeze. You cant create prolonged gains without the bio sector etf XBI doing well. The sector is 100% short right now, meaning the pigs are tanking biotech R&D and companies share prices are dwindling and they will be unable to raise the necessary funds to complete research. It's so fucked.

Every single day, you will see the XBI tank from short selloff. Then magically, at 4:01 PM, a $100 million dollar cover comes in dark pool. I assume it's the same on XRT.

Spread the word on this....needs to be an actual squeeze there. I don't know what their endgame is. I think it's the open interest on the $135 Puts.

2021-05-03 16:47:00,wallstreetbets,You guys still talking about the MVIS P&D?
2021-05-03 15:56:37,wallstreetbets,Even here I look at GME just going down.... ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)
2021-05-03 15:16:27,wallstreetbets,"everyone saying CLOV let’s go, y’all got in on the hype late and should have sold last week. sorry bout it"
2021-05-03 15:52:43,wallstreetbets,NOK NOK NOK
2021-05-03 18:18:48,wallstreetbets,CLOV belongs in the garbage.

2021-05-03 15:25:37,wallstreetbets,How about $UWMC
2021-05-03 16:08:33,wallstreetbets,This is neat. How did you do it?
2021-05-03 16:43:22,wallstreetbets,"Wsb mad mad they are doing amd wrong like that. Amd paid for dinner, made funny jokes, listened.... still got friendzoned. No chemistry."
2021-05-03 17:42:26,wallstreetbets,Where’s AMC
2021-05-03 16:03:29,wallstreetbets,"Same old fuckery, borrowed some more ETF shares to short it, lil dip"
2021-05-03 16:42:31,wallstreetbets,"gme sucks, its not worth over 100$ lol its way over-valued here from a fundamental standpoint.

Esports and a fucking gamepass / steam alternative isn’t enough to be worth 150+ LOL Jesus you gme cultists are truly retarded

Edit:  I’ll gladly take your pathetic downvote you dumb ape

Buy physical silver :) it’s the real GME."
2021-05-03 17:08:32,wallstreetbets,"Just some minor PaperHanding, $160 is this new $180 which was the new $40..."
2021-05-03 17:58:38,wallstreetbets,It honestly is. Not one mention on the front page
2021-05-03 16:18:18,wallstreetbets,Can you explain that
2021-05-03 15:39:29,wallstreetbets,Finally.  That one had its day.  It’s time to move on to the next play.
2021-05-03 16:47:48,wallstreetbets,cause people are literally delusional regarding the facts.  GME isnt worth over 100$ from the fundamentals.  and people gotta stop lying to themselves about the current short interest.  its like 18% or some shit.
2021-05-03 18:19:30,wallstreetbets,NOK till Friday will flip the other way lads... the problem with them is they said what they will do in future in 2 days... they never cared so much about the stock market. Some of you never owned a nokia. You would be surprised but this company started from making rubber boots 😀 They will always find a way to make money
2021-05-03 17:42:48,wallstreetbets,Both NOK and BB sad times
2021-05-03 13:11:40,wallstreetbets,Yeah sad to see I guess not many people know about NOK it’s a shame.. so undervalued.
2021-05-03 16:54:28,wallstreetbets,Earnings call is after hours Thursday. We are paitently holding

2021-05-03 14:07:14,wallstreetbets,AMC is a dead beat horse don’t worry.
2021-05-03 13:26:40,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, all the hype on here and volume is low AF today."
2021-05-03 14:17:05,wallstreetbets,Not saying right or wrong ... just a fact. They are under DoJ investigation. I’m pretty sure everyone is waiting for the outcome

read the DD.  solid company.  solid gamma squeeze potential.  earnings / guidance announced EARLY.  they plan to kick fucking ass in the next 2 weeks.  insiders cant sell (CEO + chammath) till its been 30$ for 90 days.

2021-05-03 19:19:10,wallstreetbets,what made you want to get into it two a few weeks ago and where did you hear about it? This is my first time hearing about this stock. 50% gain in one day? Holy Moly.
2021-05-03 19:09:05,wallstreetbets,"Its nice and cheap. They dipped big time when they rebalanced from 30 to 100 companies. Its better long term, they had 30% of their portfolio in 2 stocks that were getting the meme treatment. 

As safe of a play as any green energy stock."
2021-05-03 19:59:48,wallstreetbets,"Bought at open and it’s dropped since, thinking of putting some more in, I’m in with you 🚀"

2021-05-03 13:38:50,wallstreetbets,Seems like people are just talking about it and not tryna fight it out with these shorts. What’s happened to WSB 😂
2021-05-03 16:43:51,wallstreetbets,"actually its just an information request.  its all very normal.  but ooooh big scary fucking word there, hindenburg."

2021-05-03 18:42:55,wallstreetbets,"> its guaranteed to at least triple in value at 10$...

1) I'm already in CLOV

2) Nothing is guaranteed."

2021-05-03 17:54:01,wallstreetbets,when do you think it might happen? rough estimate?
2021-05-03 15:38:52,wallstreetbets,Everyone is tied up in GME.
2021-05-03 16:59:52,wallstreetbets,It’s been taken over. Can’t even post anything anymore. It always gets removed when you try to post some DD.

2021-05-03 14:45:27,wallstreetbets,Erroneous.
2021-05-03 17:58:16,wallstreetbets,Man I bought in February at 19 and sold at 25 last week. Just have to hold and hope it picks up steam again lol
2021-05-03 15:55:37,wallstreetbets,I'm just sitting here watching btx  and ocugen carry my portfolio today. Btx has been one of my best investments of the year.

2021-05-03 18:59:30,wallstreetbets,Me right now. I wanna buy high sell low but all the money I have left is in GME
2021-05-03 16:44:27,wallstreetbets,Which is why the MODS keep deleting $CLOV post
2021-05-03 16:33:26,wallstreetbets,True
2021-05-03 18:08:23,wallstreetbets,In the meantime my puts thank all of you 😂
2021-05-03 18:40:47,wallstreetbets,No fund or bunch of funds are so short on GME that the market would crash if they got margin called 🤣 that’s literally retarded
2021-05-03 18:58:25,wallstreetbets,Bro you didn’t read the part where I sold at 25 lol?
2021-05-03 19:47:55,wallstreetbets,"Very nice timing!  I bought at $11, sold all but 100 shares at $13.50, those are for keeps."

2021-05-03 13:35:23,wallstreetbets,"I went into margin to buy AMD shares, seems so undervalued surprised it tanked"
2021-05-03 16:06:14,wallstreetbets,ONE OF US!
2021-05-03 12:58:12,wallstreetbets,AMD getting no love whatsoever!!!
2021-05-03 13:55:17,wallstreetbets,"The reaction to AMD earnings just makes me nervous about the whole market.  AMD smashes earnings even more than expected (and was expected to smash), get rewarded with a 6% decrease over the following week (9% of you could AH on earnings day).  I've been rolling down puts since we were in the 90's and getting pretty tired of it."
2021-05-03 16:47:37,wallstreetbets,Chip shortage? I have 6 different chip stocks and would have thought they would be crushing it. Everything from Taiwan semi to intel nividia amd amat. All seem to be flat or lower
2021-05-03 17:47:47,wallstreetbets,I like this stock...chip shortage won't last forever.
2021-05-03 18:29:48,wallstreetbets,My June 18th calls in shambles. Down over 60% 😫
2021-05-03 15:22:33,wallstreetbets,"Bought the dip on Friday, or at least thought I did till today ... buying the dip again is a good idea right?"
2021-05-03 18:49:38,wallstreetbets,"Amd is back down to its support level. Will go back up this week. It’s ok to sell weeklys on your shares while you wait . If you loose the shares just buy more . Stonks only go up , unless they don’t"
2021-05-03 15:08:25,wallstreetbets,"Highly undervalued stock - AMD!! 
Not sure why WSB gang is not interested in this one at all when the short interest is so high for no reason.
I’m holding my 1592 shares and $140c 01/22. 💰🚀"
2021-05-03 13:40:44,wallstreetbets,"Etoro had a price delay I didn't notice it and bought early instead of shorting on the way down then buy back at bottom , it looks like it's ""fixed"" now but they could of been fronting all trades"
2021-05-03 16:24:23,wallstreetbets,I mean honestly is this drop about the Xilinx deal? I mean are they scared Xilinx will really shit the bed tomorrow? Su bae fixed AMD and is growing revenue at a record-breaking pace. Even if Xilinx is a broken company ATM Su bae has a plan for it I believe she can turn that company around like she did with AMD.
2021-05-03 16:42:48,wallstreetbets,I keep buying and keep having my ass handed to me. Too easy for the shorts to drive it down. Easy to borrow (ETB). They (those greedy fucks) gonna do it one too many times.

2021-05-03 19:52:43,wallstreetbets,How is this considered a yolo?
2021-05-03 17:34:00,wallstreetbets,"I know, right ? Even if this resets a bit further, I honestly the potential of the company is much greater than it currently is. Wait until the graphics card market takes on AMD and leaves NVIDIA behind just as they did with the CPU market. Apple M1 also changed the game, Intel is in big trouble. Anyhow, thank you for your service. I'm not experienced with options so I prefer shares, but either way, we're riding this together."
2021-05-03 13:55:35,wallstreetbets,It is. I have been using AMD for years and what you get for the money is just not comparable. I was a long Intel fan until 2-3 years ago. Finally saw the holy light.
2021-05-03 15:36:57,wallstreetbets,"I didn't even feel bad about using margin for it. Usually I have the ""I probably shouldn't..."" before buying an FD or a stupid buy-write on meme stock, but this sucker is gonna launch. INTC CEO saying shortage isn't short term? Data center sales up 200% YoY. For all the hate WSB gives the street, we're alingned on this: $105 avg. PT"

2021-05-03 15:11:47,wallstreetbets,Well stop rolling down puts then and get assigned? AMD is not a bad stock to own bro.
2021-05-03 14:08:06,wallstreetbets,"Yeah same happened with TSLA. Nailed earnings and tanked. It doesn't make me nervous. I think people expect these companies to do so well that when they do just well, it's just not enough, and they get out, plus there's a bunch of FUD out there, and it's easy to tank a stock by spreading it. But AMD is an outlier IMO. They've proven to do very well over the years, and they've become a huge player. Intel is in big trouble with Apple M1, and AMD has always been in between Intel and NVIDIA. In a few years we'll see the same shift from NVIDIA to AMD that we saw from Intel to AMD. It's a matter of time. Chips is a good market, these companies can adapt to the market and adapt over time."
2021-05-03 15:20:58,wallstreetbets,"Don't get me wrong I like AMD, but would you pay $100 for a company that's going to give you $1 for the rest of your life? Hell no. The problem is AMD is far from being a FCF generating machine."
2021-05-03 17:04:53,wallstreetbets,NVDA up 14% YTD. Maybe you just picked the wrong horse?
2021-05-03 15:40:33,wallstreetbets,yep
2021-05-03 17:40:12,wallstreetbets,I keep seeing great comments about AMD and it comforts me in the fact that I'm not the only ape that believes in this stock. I'd love to see some more apes out there reckoning the diamond mine and jump onboard with us. It's trading at discount price to be honest. Resistance at 78-79. This is valued at least $110 IMO. AMD will be a leader on all fronts in most fields. I've believed in them for years and I'm not changing my mind.
2021-05-03 16:16:29,wallstreetbets,"It’s back down to a cheap price. 🦍 need to unite again here, AMD was talk of the town a few months back and they’re crushing it."
2021-05-03 13:57:27,wallstreetbets,"They're not really delays. EToro gets it's trades from US brokers, I'm on IBKR and hence may have different prices than you based on what's on the market. Sometimes you may get better prices (assuming eToro is fair to its customers)."
2021-05-03 17:25:34,wallstreetbets,"Most likely, but I think it's FUD in general. Shorters work on FUD side, and it's much easier to drive a stock down than up."
2021-05-03 17:53:01,wallstreetbets,"I think the intel acquisition of altera and its subsequent failure is spooking the institutional investors, if you were to compare that to amd+xilinx. which is extra dumb considering intel shouldnt be used as a benchmark for anything these days."
2021-05-03 17:24:20,wallstreetbets,Yes but us apes are out looking for them. I can wait.
2021-05-03 13:57:57,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry, we have your back."
2021-05-03 14:12:27,wallstreetbets,"Buying more tomorrow , it should bounce back in a week easy"
2021-05-03 17:22:10,wallstreetbets,Agree !
2021-05-03 17:34:52,wallstreetbets,FUD working its way. I'd love to see other apes teach another lesson to those fuckers.
2021-05-03 17:39:03,wallstreetbets,"1000%. 60 minutes ran a story on Intel yesterday, even covering how their tech is lagging behind around 60% and how the company is trying to “close the gap” within the next 3 years. They failed to state that 3 years from now, every other chip company will be up even more with their own advancements, pushing intel even further behind! I’m in the video editing space & if you aren’t rocking with NVIDIA, you are all in on AMD. I feel like if we get some good news within the coming months (maybe car/ chip partnership, biden bill expanding chip production leading to new consoles coming out in bulk, etc.) AMD will finally make it to a proper valuation. I feel like the big wigs are covering their shorts right now hoping a majority sell off because of the downward trend, priming it for a pop. But then again, i’m just a chimp lmao 💎"
2021-05-03 16:22:04,wallstreetbets,"There was no light to see years ago because single thread performance, latency, and power consumption were so disappointing on piledriver and bulldozer, but all I buy and build at work are AMD machines now."

2021-05-03 17:28:34,wallstreetbets,"Same. Back 5 years ago you would not hesitate, you'd go Intel. There was some sort of pride in it as well, kind of like people with iPhones. But I'm quite proud to be running AMD and that's not gonna change any time soon. That's also a sign IMO. when you're proud of buying something, it mean you believe in the product, so owning a piece of it is also nice."

2021-05-03 14:11:00,wallstreetbets,"I see, then yes it's probably an issue. That said, when I bought, my order at 79 was filled even though the price on Yahoo Finance was 79.20. Their data isn't always up to date either, and it will never be. My experience of eToro is that you rarely get the best rates, it always felt like we only had the deals that no one else wanted, like we always got the price from 30 minutes ago that no one wanted anymore with an offset of .2-.5% sometimes."

 Occugen's biggest hurdle is this:

I can't believe this subreddit isn't discussing the XBI for biotech as it's what causes plays like CLOV and other bios that are short to not fully squeeze. You cant create prolonged gains without the bio sector etf XBI doing well. The sector is 100% short right now, meaning the pigs are tanking biotech R&D and companies share prices are dwindling and they will be unable to raise the necessary funds to complete research. It's so fucked.

Every single day, you will see the XBI tank from short selloff. Then magically, at 4:01 PM, a $100 million dollar cover comes in dark pool. I assume it's the same on XRT.

Spread the word on this....needs to be an actual squeeze there. I don't know what their endgame is. I think it's the open interest on the $135 Puts.

2021-05-03 17:58:18,wallstreetbets,"they have 1.3 billion people and only 13% vaccinated (those were the numbers last week), your logic is flawed and not fair. Their vaccine is incredibly effective, if there was a way to vaccinate 1.3b people faster they would be trying it..

Gonna play it again after earnings, as I'm also expecting a pullback then."
2021-05-03 15:55:01,wallstreetbets,"Could be better than expected. Certainly nothing coming from sales. Most if not all of their cash comes by way of orphan drug status, grants and foundation donations. Premium stock offerings haven't hurt either. This is a what if stock for me.What if huge news hits just prior to earnings or what if they decide to delay the earnings report. What if Kramer admitted he was shorting OCGN. Especially the what if I had bought way more back in August @ .55 . That's my worst one. Lol"
2021-05-03 16:38:48,wallstreetbets,"I see a lot of similarities between this stock and MVIS (although I believe in OCGN's immediate success more).

2021-05-03 18:12:16,wallstreetbets,"I think you have confused some numbers here. Specifically, when you see ""cost of revenue,"" that does **not** include ""mitigating losses and covering for overhead costs."" It means the cost just of the items that produced the revenue, nothing else.

For 2020, MVIS had total revenue 3.1m, with a cost of 1.4m and thus a gross profit of 1.7m. The ""overhead,"" however, was 15.8m (split as $5.9m general and 9.8m R&D). 

Combine those together and you get gross profit 1.7m *minus* operating expenses of 15.8m for an operating income of -14.1m.

NOK's operating income in 2020 was 2,060.8m. By these measures, NOK blows MVIS out of the water.

Truth is, this isn't a good way to value MVIS anyway. If you are buying MVIS, you are absolutely, totally, completely not buying it based on its current financials. It is not a ""value"" stock, it is a ""growth"" stock.

Usually, when looking at growth stocks, you start with the revenue. You want to see rapid growth of revenue or at least the potential for it.

Over the past five years, MVIS has had revenue per share of $0.28, $0.13, $0.20, $0.08, and	$0.02. This is not inherently a problem, but it is when the stock is trading at $13.86. Pick any number you want from those prior years, this is still a multiple over 50. For the most recent year, it's well above 500.

For comparison, TSLA had a revenue per share of $33.80 last year, and it trades at $684.90. A multiple of 20. (That's high, and more a ""growth"" valuation than a ""value"" one. NOK, for example, has a multiple right around 1. AAPL is around 8. AMZN is around 4.) Still far below MVIS.

Truth is, MVIS already has ""growth"" priced into it. Lots and lots of growth. Like >100% compounded annual growth of revenue. That's a problem for anyone buying now."
2021-05-03 12:23:46,wallstreetbets,"Assuming the bull perspective, the financials are not relevant right now except to note that MVIS has enough money to make it through the end of 2021 when production of their LiDAR should really begin. The rest of the DD should focus on their LiDAR and other verticals and the potential valuation of those going forward. And then it’s just a question of whether you believe MVIS will deliver on their promises."
2021-05-03 12:32:13,wallstreetbets,"MVIS is a company that could be reasonable expected to have 0 revenue in the next quarter. You have to compare it to other companies with 0 revenue, not a company that has actual products and customers. So, MVIS peers are NKLA, CRSP and such, that could have a very profitable product in the future or could disappear without ever making any profit."

2021-05-03 13:11:54,wallstreetbets,"This is one of the dumbest “DDs” I’ve ever seen and this is WSB. Being “bullish” on a company doesn’t mean “just find some other shitty company to compare it to.”  MVIS has no products. It expects to make just over $3M total from its licensing agreement with MSFT this year that everyone got so excited about, all of that cash is already on the balance sheet against a liability. This quarter they recognized $479k of revenue and reduced their liabilities by that amount, meaning they got zero actual cash inflow. They put themselves Up for sale a year ago with the stock sub $1 and now people think someone’s going to buy them for $10b? This company is a joke. (I’m not long NOK but um... that doesn’t matter)"
2021-05-03 12:21:20,wallstreetbets,"MVIS is a pure speculative play, the company goes to 0 if it becomes apparent that no buyout or any wrinkle in their product roadmap shows up. 

NOK on the other hand is an established business, bloated and coming off of a decades worth of nonsense, but it’s a business nonetheless.

2021-05-03 16:55:07,wallstreetbets,MVIS has no revenue and only a pipe dream of a big dollar buyout. More likely is they give up and there is a buyout for under $1/share. Jump ship while you can.

2021-05-03 12:29:13,wallstreetbets,"Pulled from their website:

“In October 2020 we set an aggressive schedule to complete development of our A-Sample in the April timeframe. I am proud of our talented team, their dedication and their ability to execute,” said Sumit Sharma, Chief Executive Officer of MicroVision. “I believe our differentiated, high-performance lidar sensor has the potential to advance autonomous driving and active safety systems beyond current sensors announced in the automotive market. I expect that a version of this lidar sensor could be available for sale, in initial quantities, in the third or fourth quarter of 2021,” continued Sharma.

“With an expected range of 250 meters and a field of view of 100 degrees horizontal by 30 degrees vertical, we expect this lidar sensor to provide the highest resolution point cloud at 10.8 million points per second while operating at 30 hertz. Additionally, this lidar sensor is designed to be immune to interference from sunlight and other lidars. One of the ground breaking proprietary features of this lidar sensor is its capability to output the axial, lateral and vertical velocity of moving objects at 30 hertz,” added Sharma. “We believe no lidar product on the market, ranging from frequency modulated continuous wave to time-of-flight, has this capability. To achieve safety and successful autonomous driving, we believe this capability delivered at low latency will be a key feature.”

I agree with you in that if no products are being developed, or they don’t show up in their “product roadmap”, then this company is purely based off speculation. However, with a product already developed, already in testing phase, it’s just a few more months until we start seeing MVIS release products to large automotive manufactures pursing autonomous driving.

2021-05-03 13:30:27,wallstreetbets,"Just trying to make sense of some of the more reasonable posts here. Really all about the learning experience, while sifting through the “ape mess”. If you could explain to me what your outlook is, I’d love to give it a read. No sense in putting someone down if you’re not going to properly educate them, right?"
2021-05-03 12:32:56,wallstreetbets,"Likely going to trade between $9-$11 until third quarter. You’re correct, I’m bag holding. But I finally got an internship that pays well, so hopefully I can just average down until then..."
2021-05-03 12:42:24,wallstreetbets,"OCGN is a great stock as well. I truthfully believe that mRNA technology is not the new way of vaccination. It has and always should be the injection of an extremely weakened variant of the virus, which is what OCGN has brought to the table, in partnership with Bharat Biotech. Their vaccination is safely usable for younger ages as well, with much higher success rates of defending against mutations of the virus... 

So yes, OCGN is an amazing company. Not holding any positions but I throw my hat to anyone that is."

2021-05-03 12:59:57,wallstreetbets,...How do you generate a lot of revenue without a finished product? And this is where I point you back to my previous comment. :)
2021-05-03 13:02:46,wallstreetbets,"Could you please show me where on the income statement MVIS recorded net income of 500k? Thank you. I was just looking at it for quite some time, I couldn’t find anything *that* abysmal. 

TIA."
2021-05-03 13:43:54,wallstreetbets,"I don’t understand the MVIS hype. They are a 20 year old company born out of the .com bubble that has a history of diluting shares and fucking shareholders over. They aren’t even a top “Lidar” company, sometimes the story is really good but it’s just a story."
2021-05-03 17:18:27,wallstreetbets,"I generally buy between $10-$12 (also sell some $8/$10 puts). Sell the puts for 50% profit. I sold some of my shares at $26 on the way up.

It’s works until it doesn’t. I’m long MVIS, but trading a small portion of my stack."
2021-05-03 14:49:26,wallstreetbets,This comment got me and I’m long on MVIS. Lol

2021-05-03 15:26:38,wallstreetbets,"God, shut up, you have no idea what you're talking about.

I'm also sick of morons stupid enough to compare Nokia with MVIS writing a **DD.** If you don't have the slightest clue about the stock market, fuck off and don't even try. You're just spewing unsubstantiated bullshit, /u/BigTurboAbarth."
2021-05-03 12:45:58,wallstreetbets,Growth will get crushed soon
2021-05-03 14:44:06,wallstreetbets,Correct. Read their filings.
2021-05-03 12:52:52,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough...but, and there is a big but...

On the earnings call it was noted that volume production won’t be until 2024, that’s a long ways away.

I’m not suggesting that MVIS is over, just that it’s no longer an interesting play for the dung flinging capuchins here...that is until there’s a new whiff of a buyout or Elon decides lidar is the way."
2021-05-03 14:06:10,wallstreetbets,"You seem to know less about biotechnology than you know about company governance or stock market it seems.  
Which was already a fucking low bar."
2021-05-03 18:05:15,wallstreetbets,"My question is how do they not have a finished product after being in business for 20+ years. They’ve accumulated $135 million in revenue from 2005-2020 COMBINED. The only reason they’re still alive is from share offerings and sucking the blood of their share holders. I’m not sure MVIS has ever turned a profit in any quarter in its existence, if you want to check up on that one tho feel free and let me know."
2021-05-03 17:46:12,wallstreetbets,"You have no idea how a business works. If their product was actually good, they would have made millions in pre-orders. The fact that they didn't even break a million tells you their product is garbage and the only reason the company is still in business is because they keep selling overpriced stock to gullible idiots."
2021-05-03 14:07:55,wallstreetbets,"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/29/2220174/0/en/MicroVision-Announces-First-Quarter-2021-Results.html

2021-05-03 13:58:18,wallstreetbets,"I'm not a fan of the person above ya but they did have some well engineered products. I use to have their projector. It was awesome. I would say they were ahead of their time. Great engineering in optical MEMS products, when MEMS was still picking up and LIDAR is just becoming adopted. 

Now, that isn't enough to succeed on its own, but its a solid chance. Especially compared to a lot of other companies worth more and with arguably no future."
2021-05-03 14:40:53,wallstreetbets,"Yet their chip is the technology behind the hololens in which Microsoft just got a 22 billion dollar contract for. Thanks to the Mvis sub this was discovered because neither company could ever disclose it because of an NDA. The guy literally bought one and took it apart. MVIS for most is a pure acquisition play. Whether that be the entire company or one of their verticals. And to your point , you’re right. They were apart of the dot.com bubble , that doesn’t need to define them. They now have the technology to capitalize . Go look at nvax as an example. Stock was a total failure time and time again. Then timing was right and they capitalized off covid. Mvis will capitalize off of autonomous driving. And they aren”t a top Lidar company? Name a company who has a sample even ready other than them?"
2021-05-03 19:51:27,wallstreetbets,Aiming for 10.50 this time around
2021-05-03 16:03:53,wallstreetbets,"It us just very volatile. The price has been rising for a year strait. It is just extremely volatile. The price is only falling in context of the last week. Every new peak has been higher than the last, and the lows for the most part have also been trending up."
2021-05-03 16:25:46,wallstreetbets,"Their competitors have higher market cap with less verticals and worse LiDAR for self driving cars. To be honest MVIS might take some time but I’ve got no doubt it’s going to make some really big strides later this year when they start mass production.

If you think other companies are better to invest in then sure go for it but do NOT sell at a loss on something that will recover"

2021-05-03 14:46:41,wallstreetbets,Dude that wasn’t a serious question
2021-05-03 14:30:56,wallstreetbets,Yeah but that’s in a scenario if they don’t get bought out. They need to prove the ability to go at scale and the rest is the acquirers problem

2021-05-03 14:35:52,wallstreetbets,The acquirer will overtake the production

2021-05-03 15:26:40,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a casino!  Where are you?
2021-05-03 18:52:52,wallstreetbets,They should go into the stock selling business with PLUG.
2021-05-03 18:12:48,wallstreetbets,"It’s completely understandable to look at their financial history and question that. The brief, ugly answer is they’ve had underwhelming products and switched gears a few times. So why is this time any different? I can’t guarantee it is. But the specs they *claim* on the A Sample of their LiDAR are best in class. And if so, then the potential of the company is greater than its current valuation. But this isn’t a sales pitch. The MVIS sub has all the DD you could ever ask for if you’re interested."
2021-05-03 17:50:53,wallstreetbets,"So aggressive, lol. You don’t strike me as one who is open for discussion. You invest how you want. I’ll invest how I want. Have a nice day. :)"
2021-05-03 14:44:06,wallstreetbets,I don’t understand what you idiots don’t get. You see 22B contract and forget that’s Microsoft’s money. MVIS would be lucky to get 100m from that deal. LIDAR patents are not worth 1B if they were why wouldn’t Microsoft spend 1B hire 20x the employees that are with MVIS and make they own? People can’t comprehend how much 1B is and how it’s spent.
2021-05-03 14:11:50,wallstreetbets,No I'm not a bot. 1000 shares @ 20.26$ missed the sell point also (didn't realize it was a pnd)  thought it was a better company than that.  13$ is a pretty good price imo but obviously I'm aretarded ape and my opinion is 💩💩
2021-05-03 15:56:00,wallstreetbets,Ha. I mean.... have you seen the MVIS cult here?
2021-05-03 16:31:19,wallstreetbets,"The thing about Tesla (and most other Elon Musk companies) is that they like vertical integration, where they make the critical parts in-house in order to control cost.

Elon Musk has plenty of Lidar people in-house, at both Tesla and SpaceX (the Crew Dragon capsule uses a Lidar sensor for docking with the International Space Station, which is traveling at 17,600 mph).

I don't foresee Tesla ever buying Lidars from Microvision."
2021-05-03 14:48:41,wallstreetbets,"Doesn’t matter, there are no buyers at this point in time...at least not public knowledge.

Once this ‘battleground’ stock settles at some floor (thinking $8 - $11), it will become fun again and worthy of a particular species of primate.

Until then, be respectful and bag hold in silence..."
2021-05-03 15:29:53,wallstreetbets,"If Microsoft did that, all they would end up with are more expensive lidars. So the answer to your question is literally capitalism.

It's like Canada building our own wind turbines, what you end up with are extremely expensive turbines. Good luck competing with they guy who got them from China for 1/10th the cost."
2021-05-03 15:42:03,wallstreetbets,I understand that. But given that contract Microsoft can’t let microvision go belly up. That is more of my point then the revenue.
2021-05-03 16:21:45,wallstreetbets,So painful
2021-05-03 14:49:53,wallstreetbets,Well we will see. I come back to you with some buyout news

2021-05-03 15:27:16,wallstreetbets,When will the dividend be paid out?
2021-05-03 16:03:11,wallstreetbets,I am at 2200 shares with cost basis around 14.5x. Not selling just need to understand the 1 for 1 share tax implications...
2021-05-03 17:34:59,wallstreetbets,"Those Juicy dividends will not be paid till next year till they finalize the deal. Shareholders meeting to vote on it happens on september/october. And that's actually a great thing, because not only you'll have a stock of a great, profitable business without any or almost no debt at all, you also will enjoy those juicy quarterly dividends which tends to be like 7-8% till the deal happens."

2021-05-03 12:40:10,wallstreetbets,🧐🧐 just bought 10 shares 🚀🚀
2021-05-03 12:50:29,wallstreetbets,But question. So I am looking more into it you get the 14.5 dividend and retain 1 stock of mdp. But what is the value of nmg as a stand alone? The dividend is .6b and the rest of the funds will go go what?
2021-05-03 12:41:34,wallstreetbets,Welcome aboard!
2021-05-03 12:57:02,wallstreetbets,"It will go to debt reduction and practically wipes out the debt. So National Media Group will remain as a standalone company and currently its doing around 2B in revenue and 0,3B EBITDA

&#x200B;

It's impossible to say much about NMG future, but as it has been, it has been growth for digital media and slow death for print media. For the last 2 quarters digital has been the bigger side of business."
2021-05-03 13:08:03,wallstreetbets,"So assuming price is 32.5,post dividend you essentially have a break even of 18 dollars a share. At 45m shares this would be a 800m dollar market cap. Seems like a good move especially since nmg is 2/3s of the company. It just isn’t as profitable. It also seems like they won’t write down all of the debt but most of it. This could be a very good move. I think stock will likely remain in the 30s with that sweet div

2021-05-03 13:21:00,wallstreetbets,"It is a question mark on what multiple will investors give the NMG, I think it should be higher P/E 5 for sure due to the low amount of debt that will remain in the company post transaction."

2021-05-03 19:31:12,wallstreetbets,50$ by 2030 10 by 2022 if we looking at the DD .. 5g finna boom make sure you’re on the right side
2021-05-03 13:36:37,wallstreetbets,"Because gains are gains. If you were up 100k but then the 4k worth of contracts expire worthless, you didn't lose 4k, you lost 100k. When it's worth screen shooting, it's worth selling"
2021-05-03 18:48:07,wallstreetbets,My guy you obviously understand !!!
2021-05-03 15:40:01,wallstreetbets,yeah just a bunch of NPCs
2021-05-03 19:28:34,wallstreetbets,Iv ....keep holding should see 7 by summer hopefully
2021-05-03 17:51:52,wallstreetbets,Stfu
2021-05-03 18:38:11,wallstreetbets,Wow. What a douche move. You're trying to mislead
2021-05-03 14:16:33,wallstreetbets,You know he did
2021-05-03 15:33:09,wallstreetbets,"Fucking diamond handing options, unbelievable. Some people have no business trading. I guess you'll be making other people tons of money though."
2021-05-03 14:01:56,wallstreetbets,You had me all excited. I have 20 of those options and jumped in to get a swift kick on the nuts once I realized they are still $12 each.
2021-05-03 12:19:48,wallstreetbets,"If you don’t like tendies that is fine, to my fellow apes I will see you on the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕🌕🌕🦍💎🙌🏽"
2021-05-03 15:10:08,wallstreetbets,That is next level retarded.
2021-05-03 13:15:38,wallstreetbets,...for shares not options. Ape no want theta bleed.
2021-05-03 13:27:44,wallstreetbets,"Well, if bad decisions is what you’re making. Buy a sprinter van with a portion of what you’ve made.... you know, that way you’ll have something cozy to sleep in and/or suck dick in for laundry change later on down the road *taps forehead* :)"
2021-05-03 12:34:09,wallstreetbets,Idk if that how it works persay
2021-05-03 15:31:11,wallstreetbets,"Lol I meant the whole time I was down on my calls I didn’t sell them even though people talked bad about NOK daily lol, not do not sell if you’re up 100k"
2021-05-03 18:07:13,wallstreetbets,Go drink a beer and chill out bud
2021-05-03 14:28:26,wallstreetbets,Yeah big oof. Gotta follow the old adage: if its good enough to screencap its good enough to sell
2021-05-03 13:16:34,wallstreetbets,Theta makes it worth it I like living life on the edge 😂 but yes shares much better if one has shaky hands
2021-05-03 19:30:00,wallstreetbets,"This isn’t my first rodeo boss, I ain’t no paper handed bitch. Didn’t reach my target but let’s see where we at a year from now set yourself a reminder. Y’all paper hand at 100k can’t imagine a real money play lol"
2021-05-03 18:29:53,wallstreetbets,Don’t post stupid shit lol
2021-05-03 13:51:28,wallstreetbets,Yo what the hell theres no more upside here but a lot of downside risk what are you doing yo
2021-05-03 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Bought more $MVIS while it's dipping for the May squeeze 
2021-05-03 17:09:19,wallstreetbets,GME did a number on this sub every big jump on a stock is now a squeeze to these retards
2021-05-03 13:10:27,wallstreetbets,The 40% increase in one day was not the squeeze?
2021-05-03 11:51:52,wallstreetbets,"May squeeze is a gamble, but holding MVIS long has a decent chance to pay off. This is hoping for the acquisition deal that's been a rumor for the last 18 months.

I've got MVIS calls and stock myself, but holding just for a squeeze isn't a smart idea and everyone needs to understand MVIS long is totally speculative."
2021-05-03 15:07:49,wallstreetbets,there was never a squeeze with MVIS you clown
2021-05-03 18:10:27,wallstreetbets,"One thing I find very amusing is that the last squeeze before GME was YEARS ago if I’m understanding correctly, but yet somehow in the span of a few months there’s apparently like 5 different squeezes"
2021-05-03 13:43:55,wallstreetbets,I sucked the egg and bought it at $25 😤luckily only put down $1k for fun so only first degree burns. Trying to decide if i should hold long or sell when its back near 20
2021-05-03 14:14:39,wallstreetbets,Well just hope you don't have to baghold as long as the folks that invested back in 2000 lol
2021-05-03 13:55:38,wallstreetbets,"31% short volume ratio, 70k short shares available at the time of this comment, 15.65% Short Borrow Fee Rate,  Blackstone Alternative Investment Funds currently shorting the stock, I'd say it's still possible for another squeeze, as long as it doesn't drop further.  So now is probably a good time to buy.

EDIT:  I'm a bag holder, turned long term investment trader, not by choice."
2021-05-03 11:55:33,wallstreetbets,Mvis lezz go🚀🚀💪💎😎
2021-05-03 18:31:44,wallstreetbets,Saw a post a week or two ago by “a new MVIS millionaire”...wonder if he sold near the top or still holding.
2021-05-03 14:07:27,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-05-03 14:20:13,wallstreetbets,"Well played! I personally have held the stock for a while now and also bought options today. Their tech is in Hololens , Army IVAS, and in my opinion soon to e in cars. Go $mvis"
2021-05-03 16:18:29,wallstreetbets,Are we supposed to hold? My avg at $26 😅🙂🤣
2021-05-03 11:52:01,wallstreetbets,The shorts will have their nuts squeezed
2021-05-03 12:31:30,wallstreetbets,Is this a squeeze
2021-05-03 14:03:03,wallstreetbets,"what I've learned in my time at WSBs. If the stock goes down a lot after going up a lot, it surely surely means there is another short squeeze around the corner. for sure. 

Also, whenever a stock goes down, this is an opportunity to buy a dip. It makes no difference how many days in a row a stock does this as it simply presents more dip buying options.

And finally, most advice here is questionable."
2021-05-03 12:20:23,wallstreetbets,You ever heard the phrase: throwing good money after bad?
2021-05-03 18:37:58,wallstreetbets,Still sticking in hoping for it to go to $30
2021-05-03 15:24:57,wallstreetbets,"MSMS

# MAY SQUEEZE MAY SQUEEZE"
2021-05-03 15:32:04,wallstreetbets,"I was looking at MVIS @ 11 and was like... nah.  Then it went 20+ and I kicked myself.  Now it's back down to 13.  It's not a stonk, it's a carny ride..."
2021-05-03 12:43:28,wallstreetbets,MVIS to the moon 🚀🚀
2021-05-03 14:59:15,wallstreetbets,Mvis will get bought out. Question is when? With all of this pushing in the automotive industry now...
2021-05-03 15:50:25,wallstreetbets,May squeeze? Say what?
2021-05-03 17:11:07,wallstreetbets,Lmao nothing is getting squeeze tf is wrong with you 😂
2021-05-03 13:07:22,wallstreetbets,"Le short squeeze, let's get them redditors!!! 

Thanks for helping my puts print, retards."
2021-05-03 12:05:57,wallstreetbets,I’ll get back in at $8
2021-05-03 15:38:46,wallstreetbets,You're in cause you think it's a potential squeeze? You're an idiot.
2021-05-03 12:11:10,wallstreetbets,the only thing you should buy on mvis is puts
2021-05-03 15:00:10,wallstreetbets,"Oh. 

Y’all MVIS people actually think this is GME 2.0. 

Yikes."
2021-05-03 12:41:13,wallstreetbets,Whats the confirmation?Buy on support just the dip?Sorry Im newbie noob
2021-05-03 13:52:15,wallstreetbets,Nice👍
2021-05-03 14:35:17,wallstreetbets,There is no squeeze …..
2021-05-03 17:41:49,wallstreetbets,Bro why can't we bring mvis on $ 100 a share? Let's be legend and buy the mthrfckr!!!!!!!! Right now you can buy 10 mvis for 1 gme share!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2021-05-03 18:41:35,wallstreetbets,No May squeeze! Everything is not a squeeze.stop 🛑
2021-05-03 13:33:08,wallstreetbets,Holding 600 shares and buying more. Fuck Citadel and other HF. Buy and hold diamond hands 🙌 quit being such paper handed pussies. Stay strong and together and we can make this happen.
2021-05-03 17:19:40,wallstreetbets,Book value on this stock is .70 cents
2021-05-03 15:57:57,wallstreetbets,Yes. I also bought 10k of MVIS but also 10k of VLDR -> They are announcing Earnings next week: It‘s gonna be huge and is also highly shorted. MVIS and VLDR definitely most undervalued stocks!
2021-05-03 17:46:13,wallstreetbets,For serious right now? ?
2021-05-03 13:38:28,wallstreetbets,I thought wsb forgot this company already?
2021-05-03 11:44:40,wallstreetbets,☠️
2021-05-03 13:48:29,wallstreetbets,"Haha ... oh no, it's actually retarded"
2021-05-03 11:45:19,wallstreetbets,Delete - no karma
2021-05-03 11:56:40,wallstreetbets,"Did u not hear?

MVIS is the next ENRON"
2021-05-03 14:13:06,wallstreetbets,"Suckers, this crap company is going back under $5. Maybe down to $1 where it was just a few months ago.

\*\*\* EDIT it was last under $1 6/3/2020 so 11 months ago... My bad! \*\*\*"
2021-05-03 11:55:20,wallstreetbets,"Better would be buy Etsy , Earning is on Wednesday. I think it will go 130$ or higher"
2021-05-03 15:57:53,wallstreetbets,"Can anyone tell me where sndl going to be at? Hedge fund is keep shorting it , lost 50% in matter of month , could anyone give advice"
2021-05-03 17:57:23,wallstreetbets,Where do you buy mvis? I can’t buy it on Webull
2021-05-03 13:51:56,wallstreetbets,Or the 150% in one week?
2021-05-03 18:19:15,wallstreetbets,"MVIS has had plenty of 40% or more increases without the WSB guys coming in. Everyone jumped in for like 3 days, saw a jump, and assumed that was the squeeze lol. 

If everyone had held for a couple weeks I am pretty sure we would have seen so much more than $27 or $31 AH."
2021-05-03 17:37:51,wallstreetbets,"There is no squeeze,just lidar sample presentation hype and buyout rumors.
Imho there will be a buyout, it's a ""tech of the future"", and I'm looking for a new entry point after having sold for.profits at 24.

Glta"
2021-05-03 19:09:03,wallstreetbets,UWMC is a better play.
2021-05-03 19:40:01,wallstreetbets,lmao people are so delusional and desperate at this point that 40% in one day isn’t enough.
2021-05-03 12:47:31,wallstreetbets,"yeah, I agree, if you're not buying MVIS because you believe in the tech and are waiting for a potential buyout, then you're probably in it for the wrong reasons."
2021-05-03 13:57:12,wallstreetbets,Rumors of Microsoft buying MVIS have been swirling since 2017.  I wouldn't bet on it.
2021-05-03 11:55:55,wallstreetbets,"At this current value I feel like if the squeeze doesn't happen, I'll definitely make my money back and a few %. With the new lidar system being released and enough hype around WSB I feel like this can easily sit in the 20's or high teens if the squeeze doesn't pan out."
2021-05-03 13:36:05,wallstreetbets,18 months? It’s been a rumor for 18 years.
2021-05-03 14:29:41,wallstreetbets,What company in their right mind would pay over $2B to acquire this when MVIS was worth like $150M this time last year? Yes they released a prototype. Cool. That ain’t worth anywhere near 2 billion. You guys aren’t thinking about this logically.
2021-05-03 15:10:10,wallstreetbets,Why was it not acquired when it was less than a dollar per share?
2021-05-03 13:32:14,wallstreetbets,"Why would anyone buy them after that garbage earnings report? It’s not a billion dollar company, it’d be cheaper just to poach the engineers since leadership there seems to be eating lead infused crayons."
2021-05-03 15:22:20,wallstreetbets,"$2B acquisition is $10 a share. And that assumes someone ridiculously overpays for them when there is a comparable sale of $150M.

Hope you bought in earlier than that."
2021-05-03 13:09:24,wallstreetbets,Its getting shorted heavily and all indications point to Citadel. Id like to know the current short interest
2021-05-03 14:47:05,wallstreetbets,"last 18 months?!?!?!

the MSFT buyout rumours started in 2017...

Revenue has plunged year to year to only $500K....

LIDAR does not work in snow, rain, fog...bright lights coming towards you....so how does this work for self driving..that is why TSLA uses RADAR....

Musk just showed that cameras and AI have evolved to the point where he does not use RADAR any longer.

LIDAR cannot recognize what the hazard is, but AI can identify exactly what the hazard is...

Think about it...humans drive with vision, not LIDAR...just human vision

There is no upside, its over."
2021-05-03 16:33:00,wallstreetbets,shhhh
2021-05-03 16:14:00,wallstreetbets,There is no doubt it will recover however the timeline to do so isn’t guaranteed
2021-05-03 14:20:45,wallstreetbets,Hold
2021-05-03 18:36:41,wallstreetbets,"You're not alone, threw in $1k at $23 🦍. Just gonna hold at this point..."
2021-05-03 17:50:58,wallstreetbets,LOL the edit
2021-05-03 12:36:09,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 BUY!
2021-05-03 11:54:24,wallstreetbets,See ya later student loans
2021-05-03 12:55:43,wallstreetbets,I'm short and it's fucking printing I love it
2021-05-03 12:36:53,wallstreetbets,YES 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 buy now!
2021-05-03 12:29:02,wallstreetbets,I've also heard the phrase: You Only Live Once
2021-05-03 13:35:04,wallstreetbets,I sold at 26 from 10. MVIS has been good to me.
2021-05-03 14:24:59,wallstreetbets,When did you buy the account? First post in five years and you use it to spam mvis?
2021-05-03 12:45:14,wallstreetbets,I’ll get back in at $3
2021-05-03 14:41:13,wallstreetbets,Ima buy a put
2021-05-03 13:05:11,wallstreetbets,Just buy the dips and wait for the traction to pick back up again
2021-05-03 15:40:13,wallstreetbets,You sound like a moron. Enjoybag holding.
2021-05-03 12:00:58,wallstreetbets,Did Enron have former Google and Ford execs on their board with the best LiDAR on the market? Or their IP powering Microsoft’s Hololense 2 which just secured a 22B contract? I think not
2021-05-03 14:25:17,wallstreetbets,"Before WSB heard of it, it was resting around $10 so that’s a falsehood."
2021-05-03 15:39:39,wallstreetbets,Based on...?
2021-05-03 14:57:17,wallstreetbets,It was retail buying power
2021-05-03 18:31:43,wallstreetbets,Shorts never covered during those jumps
2021-05-03 13:56:29,wallstreetbets,"Or you bought it for a quick play (in which case your ship has sailed, hope you aren't still on the dock)"
2021-05-03 19:40:45,wallstreetbets,"the only real “reason” is to make money, everything else is bullshit. and you’re lying."
2021-05-03 17:27:38,wallstreetbets,I just wanted to create some 😩👌💦 loss porn. Am I in it for the wrong reasons?
2021-05-03 15:20:04,wallstreetbets,I swear 99% of the DD on here and rumors end up being completely wrong. Seems like this sub is mostly used for a P&D.
2021-05-03 17:27:02,wallstreetbets,I should have read that a week ago
2021-05-03 14:26:28,wallstreetbets,Lol msft wouldn’t buy them out for much anyway
2021-05-03 13:58:00,wallstreetbets,"$13-$14 is a great buy-in price for me, personally. I've bought more and also got May 21 calls for $15, $25, and $35. The last two are super cheap bets that are fun to take, but I do belive in the $15 call.

Anyone wanting to get in on MVIS long and not for short term squeeze hopes, now is a great time."
2021-05-03 14:57:17,wallstreetbets,"Right but the language of the CEO has changed, for the longest time they were 'pursuing' partnerships, that changed to 'evaluating' strategic partnerships earlier this year, then it was changed to 'negotiating' strategic partnerships in the latest earnings call."
2021-05-03 13:56:12,wallstreetbets,This is very true 😅🤣
2021-05-03 15:01:48,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, why would anyone want to acquire MVIS with all these IPs and patents?

www.microvision.com/technology"
2021-05-03 14:46:23,wallstreetbets,"It’s called a comparable.   Look at the other Lidar companies like LAZR and Velodyne, check their market cap and then you have your answer."
2021-05-03 19:55:12,wallstreetbets,"Umm excuse me sir but they generated a whopping $479k in revenue last quarter, all from licensing (passive income).

What company wouldn’t want to pay $2 billion for that?"
2021-05-03 15:34:00,wallstreetbets,"I have no clue, I'm not somebody the deals in corporate acquisitions. I do know that there can always be a bunch of factors that the common investor have no clue are at play, for the better or the worse. There's a reason obviously, and it could be promising or not."
2021-05-03 19:35:17,wallstreetbets,"Because the CEO and Board know that whoever buys them out is getting the best in class lidar, while all their competitors are still years behind.

So it’s obviously in their benefit to conduct a massive bidding war, since the winner of the bid is going to make tens or even hundreds of billions off being the first to market with functional lidar.

The share price doesn’t matter in a bidding war. What matters is how much are you willing to pay and this could go down as one of the most significant corporate bidding wars we’ve seen in a long time due to the players involved."
2021-05-03 13:38:48,wallstreetbets,"Cause they got patents for all that shit and their lidar is finally finished and rdy for production in Q3
Of course their earnings was shit, they didn’t have a product to sell yet. But they got enough money to survive till they are rdy for mass production. I think buying at 10$ or so and then just holding long term is a solid play. If one is lucky we may get a little squeeze or a buyout otherwise holding long term and in 1-2 years stock should go up decently"
2021-05-03 13:55:41,wallstreetbets,"Their earnings are ALWAYS like that. I think someone already said it, but their worth is in their patents and IP's, especially in AR and LiDAR. As they said in the earnings call, they're ramping up production to meet future demands. They're already also in on the Microsoft DoD contract.

MVIS is mainly sitting around waiting to be acquired by a big dog that can maximize the profits off their tech. Rumors have been around forever, but lately most cases/theories are being made for Microsoft, Nvidia, and Google.

MVIS earnings mean nothing. They always look like that. I sold before earnings and bought right back in after with no worries."
2021-05-03 15:32:03,wallstreetbets,"True, that's if no bidding war starts over Microvision. Actual valuation means nothing if you've got something that a few different companies want.

Once again though, all speculation."
2021-05-03 13:13:40,wallstreetbets,No indications point to Citadel you 🤡
2021-05-03 14:59:41,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the rumors are old as shit. They got re-stoked about 18 months ago, then again recently with all the hype.

Elon is trying to talk down LiDAR while his cars are crashing in autonomous mode 😅

As I said, I'm long on MVIS. I like the company, I like the tech, and I like the stock. I'll wait because I believe in it and I like it. I won't try to convince anyone else to because this is a rollercoaster stock to hold (and I've only been in for the last four months). I've realized more gains than the unrealized losses I currently sit at so it's no problem for me to hold it.

I've only been in for a few months and I've rode PLENTY of rides and made money. Every time afterwards there's the ""move on, it's over"" crowd. Then I double down and wait for the next liftoff 🤷‍♂️"
2021-05-03 15:49:23,wallstreetbets,"seriously, are you retarded?"
2021-05-03 15:07:25,wallstreetbets,"Lidar directly detects range and velocity, TSLA is betting machine learning will be able to guess this info.

But Elon only bet on that because lidar was too expensive for his purposes at the time. Which is exactly what mvis is getting around."
2021-05-03 17:13:59,wallstreetbets,You’re a fucking idiot. Do some research before spreading bullshit
2021-05-03 12:41:44,wallstreetbets,Whwn to buy?

2021-05-03 15:56:00,wallstreetbets,Agreed on both accounts. MVIS is absolutely a highly speculative long.
2021-05-03 15:42:51,wallstreetbets,"Yes for general lidar tech those low visibility conditions are a problem, but also ones that mvis have claimed they have specifically addressed with their tech. 

If that could be true then you have a big advantage over camera tech which would be just as disadvantaged by the noise when it's trying to infer the 3d geometry around it.

I don't think lidar alone is enough obviously as you say how is it going to read signs for example. But the question is whether it brings you closer to full autonomous driving stage faster, cheaper and with less reliance on inherently risky extrapolation."

2021-05-03 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$GPRO - GoPro's New Business Model and Strong Upside #  Summary

**The highlights of this analysis are as follows:**

* The management has changed the business model of GoPro into a more DTC business. 
* GoPro's subscription side of their business had 55% QoQ and 145% YoY growth rates.
* GoPro has plans to increase their gross margins becasue of their DTC model.
* The 3 main industries GoPro Operates within are growing relatively quickly (consumer electronics, photographic equipment, and action camera's)
* GoPro's main competition is DJI, Akaso, and Garmin (especially in the action camera market)

**Investment Plan:**

* Buy between $10-14 and hold long-term (until it reaches fair value)
* Sell if the stock falls below $10.49
* Look for re-entry at $8.80-$9.20 (if stock falls below $10.49 and you sell)

**Stocks Fair Value:**

Using a DCF (as seen in the analysis below), GoPro has an estimated share value of $39.12, this implies a potential upside of 248.35%. 

If you  follow my advice above there is only a 6.59% downside risk before selling and re-entry, this makes the risk-to-reward of my trading strategy very favourable.

# Analysis

**Company Overview:**

GoPro manufactures and sells cameras, drones, and other filming/photography accessories. Their main products consist of the HERO7, HERO8 and HERO 9 cameras, and a MAX 360-degree waterproof camera. The HERO 9 camera is the best-selling camera in the US digital market. GoPro also offers cloud-based storage solutions that enables customers to access, edit and share the content they film on any of GoPro’s cameras. GoPro also offers camera protection plans (GoPro Care) and video editing applications (Quik).

GoPro markets and sell their products through retailors/distributors, as well as through their own e-commerce store. GoPro was founded in 2002 and went public in 2014, and since its IPO has fallen by over 31%.

GoPro has a TTM revenue of $891.9M, a TTM EBITDA of -$22.6M and a market cap of 1.719B. Since their EBITDA is negative and their PE is N/A, putting a value on this company is difficult.

Recently, GoPro has reconstructed their business model and it has costed them time and money to undergo this. GoPro has taken on a more direct to consumer (DTC) approach in their business model, this has led them to scale back on spending, sales and marketing expenditures, and office space. Furthermore, the board of directors volunteered to forego their compensation in order to make this transition. This is important because it signals to us that they are confident that the changes being made will benefit GoPro in the future.

Investment Information:

**Company and Financial Information:**

GoPro has 3.2B video views on YouTube and has a total following of 44M across all social platforms. This exposure can be leveraged to market their products, and gain product awareness at a significant discount. Furthermore, they have been a leader in the US camera market for nearly a decade and have the necessary experience in order to succeed with the new changes being made.

GoPro’s active paying GoPro subscribers are up 52% QoQ, and 145% YOY. This is one of their newer sources of income and to see this early growth is a sign of good things to come for GoPro as a company.

GoPro has ambitious plans for 2021, these plans include monetizing their app and driving their subscription business model, increase the DTC component of their business, and grow their gross margins from 36% to 38-40%.

GoPro has 771,000 subscribers to their subscription service, charging an annual fee of $49.99. This amounts to their subscription service bringing in $38.54M last year.

Furthermore, GoPro plans to launch their Quik Subscription service which includes a fraction of the features available in their main subscription package.

GoPro’s forecasts that their adjusted EBITDA will be $68M at FYE 2020. This results in a 24.57x EBITDA multiple, this can help us to value GoPro in the later stages of this report.

**Industry Information:**

GoPro resides in the Consumer Electronics Market, which is valued at $1T and is estimated to grow at a CAGR of over 7% between 2020-2026. By 2026 (incorporating current industry trends) the consumer electronics market is estimated to be valued at $1.5T, with 70% of the market being from audio and visual segments, both of which are segments of GoPro’s business.

Another industry that GoPro operates in is the Photographic equipment and supplies industry which is valued at $22B and is expected to grow at a 5.78% CAGR for the next 6 years. This industry is dominated by the likes of Canon, Nikon, Panasonic, Fujifilm and Samsung, however the market is shifting to Online retail quickly, giving GoPro an advantage over some of the other manufacturers in this industry.

Lastly, GoPro operates in the Action Camera Market is valued at 3.5B and is expected to grow at a 14% CAGR until 2026. By this time, the industry is expected to be valued at $5.5B.

By averaging the CAGR of the industries that GoPro Operates within, we can find a CAGR for the next 5 years in our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to determine the fair value share price.

**Competition:**

DJI specializes is a market leader for drone and action cameras. Recently, they have launched their very first action camera, the Osmo Action, which is supposed to compete with GoPro’s HERO7. The Osmo Action has a front-facing screen and has a higher bitrate than the HERO7.

Akaso produces action cameras similar to the current models that GoPro manufactures. Recently, they have launched their EK7000 Camera that is a popular and more affordable alternative to buying a GoPro. The EK7000 does not include video stabilization and voice control like GoPro, however it comes in at a cheaper price point, and captures some of the action camera market from GoPro.

Garmin is an American technology company that creates products for aviation, automotive, marine, outdoor and sport activities. Garmin’s VIRB Ultra 30 Action Camera, is similar to many GoPro models, shooting video in up to 4K, with similar size and weight to that of GoPro. The Garmin VIRB Ultra 30 includes a built in GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope and altimeter, which may be attractive for some consumers.

**Investment Plan and Valuation:**

Since GoPro has a negative value for their EBITDA, we cannot use EBITDA multiples to value this company. Instead, we must use a DCF model to determine the fair value per share.

Using a DCF yields an estimated per share value of $39.12. The only way that I can see this price coming to fruition would be if they can successfully implement the changes that they are currently working on, and if GoPro’s management can continue to look for ways to be a leader and make the first moves in their respective industries.

With that being said, the most important thing to look for in GoPro to determine if they can pull this off would be their management and their experience. By looking at their current management and their backgrounds, it is evident that they have replaced and added on a lot of new management in the past couple of years, and these new additions and replacements have a surplus of applicable experience. This new and experienced management has already challenged the business model and are making key changes that will help to turn a new chapter at GoPro, I believe that this management is well suited to lead GoPro into a better future.

For the aforementioned reasons I have decided to recommend buying GoPro. If you can buy the shares in the $10-14 range, you will be taking on minimal risk and having the optimal chance for a large return. If you buy at current prices $11.23, I recommend holding unless the stock falls below $10.49, if this happened, I would sell and look for a re-entry at $8.80-9.20, then hold long term.

Right now the XLNX  stock is about $124, but it is now linked to the value of AMD share price by this fixed exchange ratio. Right now its at like 1.55, So theres money to be made by playing games between the two prices."
2021-05-03 13:13:38,wallstreetbets,I was making Wolf of Wallstreet reference.
2021-05-03 16:37:52,wallstreetbets,actually its a wolf of wall street reference
2021-05-03 13:36:17,wallstreetbets,I'm short the puts whatever smooth-brain downvoted this.
2021-05-03 11:59:50,wallstreetbets,Yah I get that. But if they want to make money they can go long XLNX and short AMD to close the arb. Holding AMD down makes no sense without going long XLNX.
2021-05-03 12:06:30,wallstreetbets,"Thats what they are doing. AMD is the one of the most shorted tech companies out there. 

they are probably waiting on the earnings tomorrow to see how low they can get xlnx before putting calls on XLNX."
2021-05-03 12:09:51,wallstreetbets,Fair play
2021-05-03 14:34:40,wallstreetbets,Can you explain that to a retarded break it down Barnes style?
2021-05-03 15:23:48,wallstreetbets,"So AMD is buying XLNX in an all stock deal. After the merger is complete, every XLNX share (currently 124ish), will convert to 1.7234 AMD shares. So in theory the price of 1 XLNX share should be the price of AMD \* 1.7234, cuz that's what you'll end up with. But right now XLNX is trading at like 8% less. Some of this is ""risk the deal won't go through"". But most of this is just fuckery that can be arb'd away by going long XLNX and short AMD in the correct ratio."
2021-05-03 14:50:39,wallstreetbets,"If xlnx stays at the current price, until AMD goes down to ~ $72, you can buy XLNX instead and end up with more AMD stock per dollar after the merger.

Thus, they can short AMD until it matches XLNX, and go long on XLNS calls."
2021-05-03 16:51:23,wallstreetbets,Your a gentleman and a scholar thank you.
2021-05-03 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What's Happening in the Markets: Week of 5/3/2021 Hi Everyone! Here is my Monday DD :) Happy trades and please DM me with any questions you may have :)

**Week of 5/3/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 5/3/21 at 4205.86, above the previous close of 4181.61 on Friday 4/30/21.

Manufacturing numbers release early in the week, with the April Markit Manufacturing PMI released Monday, and trade deficit & factory orders numbers for March releasing Tuesday, May 4th. Markit services PMI and ISM services index numbers for April release Wednesday, and productivity & labor costs for Q1 release Thursday. The ADP Employment report for April releases Wednesday, and weekly jobless claims numbers release Thursday, May 6th. April unemployment rates release Friday, as well as nonfarm payrolls, and average hourly earnings.

The average cost to build a home skyrocketed by $36,000 according to the National Association of Homebuilders. The rising prices are likely associated with soaring lumber costs. Lumber futures are up 125% on a 6-month basis. REITs reflected the change, rising throughout April. March construction numbers release Monday at 10AM.

Verizon has reached an agreement with Apollo Global Management to sell its Verizon Media platform, which consists of internet pioneers Yahoo and AOL. The agreement to sell the tech platforms to the private equity firm will be worth $5 Billion. As a stipulation of the agreement Verizon will maintain a 10% stake in the new company, which Apollo plans to call “Yahoo.” Apollo releases earnings on Monday, May 3rd.

Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020’s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand.

Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...\[take\] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware.

The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.GM reports earnings on Wednesday and markets will be curious to see if the chip shortage has affected them. Despite supply chain concerns CNBC’s Jim Cramer was optimistic in his recent review of the company, saying “If you want to bet on electric vehicles with much less risk, I say buy some Ford or General Motors… these are huge, established companies with improving balance sheets and real earnings, earnings that happen to be skyrocketing right now...”

The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders in April to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap.

The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reported earnings of $1.40 per share on Wednesday, April 28th, exceeding analyst estimates of $0.98 after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year Wednesday April 21st, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat.

Microsoft reported earnings of $1.95 per share Tuesday, April 27th, beating analyst estimates of $1.78 by a small margin. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector.

2021-05-03 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I’m all in on RKT Here’s why I’m bullish on RKT. Before you ask, no I’m not licensed. I just like the stock. Not advice do your own DD. 

DD 

• housing market is INSANE right now. Many houses being sold well above asking price. Housing shortage throughout the country. 4 million houses short of buyer demand (per WSJ HERE: https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-housing-market-is-nearly-4-million-homes-short-of-buyer-demand-11618484400) 

• Fed is keeping interest rates low, which is incentivizing people to buy, refinance, and so forth. Anecdote, I refinanced my house in February because it was only $3,000 cost to me, but I would save buckets over the life of the loan. 

• Rising cost of lumber is forcing new homes to be more expensive. Thus, mortgage companies are financing *more* money. 

• $RKT releases earnings on Wednesday, which will be a huge catalyst of what’s to come. Last earnings they went through the roof, gaining near 100% in the short term. 

• $RKT’s competition $LDI smashed earnings this morning with $0.98 EPS, compared to an expected $0.58 EPS. LDI seems to be a much smaller company, and I think this could be indicative of a huge beat for RKT. 

• currently 8% short interest (pretty low, but the stock itself also has relatively low volume)

Thoughts?"

2021-05-03 17:45:47,wallstreetbets,"Love the DD here, but one thing I’m really hoping for (that this post is missing, for all its many strengths 👍🏻) is the potential announcement of Rocket Auto. 

I’ll try to find the article I read this on so I can edit it in here in a bit, but supposedly RKT has apparently initiated (but not advertised) partnerships with one or more used car dealerships where RKT handles facets of their sales in exchange for a certain amount of those companies stock. I saw a post from a redditor here who asked a call center employee from said company if they were working with Rocket Auto and the call center guy said “how did you know”? I’ve even seen screenshots from customers who stumbled into a Rocket Auto hyperlink on the official RKT website that denied them access because it’s currently only being offered to select customers, likely to keep the word from getting out before earnings. Never saw any info past that point, but from what I gathered it seems like the Rocket Auto tech framework and industry setup is past at least the development stage and potentially primed for general release. 

If RKT were to announce Rocket Auto (aside, what a fcking great name) during this earnings report people might start correlating RKT’s price target with companies that offer similar services like Carvana, which is currently trading in the... *checks notes* ...hundreds of dollars?? 

Obviously your own DD, I literally don’t have the sources or data to back this claim up so please take this with many grains of salt, but the announcement of Rocket Auto is definitely something that’s been on my mind when considering the upcoming earnings report. Blowout earnings and/or potential second special dividend and/or announcement of sector diversification into the auto market?

Trying to think why institutions hate mortgage companies rn and my beat guess is because we are at the bottom of the interest rate cycle. Rates only go up from here and that’s bad for the future. Allegedly."
2021-05-03 15:16:38,wallstreetbets,"btw regarding the RKT, I see that they are actively growing in terms of the amount of [linkedin employees](https://contora.ai/ticker/rkt#linkedin_employees) \- they are rapidly expanding their staff for the last 2 months. Also, I noticed that they began to grow even before everyone started talking about them. For some reason, everyone misses this moment, although its quite important indirect indicator of the company's growth."

2021-05-03 17:23:05,wallstreetbets,The special dividend is a big reason for the run last earnings. The short interest doesn’t seem like enough for it to pop again.

2021-05-03 15:06:29,wallstreetbets,"RKT price will go up when people see it as a stable and growing long-term hold. I think that's the problem for the stock. And it makes sense that people should be cautious about it, since it IPO'd just last August. 

But a rule of thumb I've heard is to wait 6 months after an IPO then see if the executives are buying or selling their own shares and how the price is doing then. Well, we're now past that time period and Rocket Companies has already stated that they plan to buy back $1 billion worth of shares.

This earning report is also important because it shows how well the company is doing after around 6 months have passed since the IPO. Maybe this earnings report would make the difference which convinces masses of people to add some shares of RKT to their long-term portfolio. 

That's the kind of thing which would increase volume for a long time, thus pushing up the price.

And if that's what's about to happen, RKT at around $22.50 right now is a bargain.

People are acting like RKT is some well-established stock that's been around a long time and everyone's supposed to understand how great it is. The truth is that it takes time for the public to get to know a stock after it's been IPO'd.

This could be a good opportunity right now to get in early while it's low. But it all depends on the public viewing it as a long-term hold.

Speaking of long-term hold, that massive $500 million purchase of shares a month ago at $25.25/share looks a lot like a large institution which is convinced that RKT is a good long-term hold."

2021-05-03 12:44:51,wallstreetbets,I bought few shares so my advice is you better stay out of it! Everytime I invest in something it dips!

2021-05-03 15:33:32,wallstreetbets,I’m not all in at this point but I’m definitely long on rocket. I’m still sitting on 200 shares at 22.95 but I sold about half my position when it got close to 40 so I’m not worried about what I have left in there. Bullish🤜🏻

2021-05-03 18:39:33,wallstreetbets,I bought rkt day one and I watched my investment grow and as soon as the first earnings report dropped shit tanked and every time after that it did the same company is extremely profitable and they limit risk because they don’t actually hold the loan they are really only the loan originator so pretty much they just print money it’s a good company and best advice I can give you is sell on every pop and re buy once it drops again and it will drop again
2021-05-03 19:30:05,wallstreetbets,340+ shares and bullish. Only up from here.
2021-05-03 11:49:18,wallstreetbets,Copy/Paste for UWMC

I'm sharpening my guillotine."
2021-05-03 18:42:30,wallstreetbets,Solid explanation but I believe it’s depends on the area. And no media is covering that there are shitload of houses sitting on the market that were built while back and couldn’t sell.

2021-05-03 13:27:15,wallstreetbets,I totally disagree.  The housing market is ‘insane’ because there is no inventory of homes which should not come as a surprise with millions of homeowners in forbearance and an eviction moratorium in place.  There isn’t much reason for people to sell.  That is not a good thing if you are in the mortgage industry which lives and dies on volume.

2021-05-03 10:37:55,wallstreetbets,That’s a true statement. But as the US continues to grow (population) there will continue to be a need for more housing and so forth.

2021-05-03 15:11:31,wallstreetbets,Ya but the difference between this and other IPO is RKT has been around 30 years already before ipo and grown stronger each year
2021-05-03 10:38:13,wallstreetbets,That’s what my thought process was.
2021-05-03 14:46:31,wallstreetbets,Lightning struck twice with GME. Meme stocks seem to kind of ebb and flow based on how risky the market is feeling. About time for another RKT spike. It's been awhile. Feels like the time is right.
2021-05-03 12:19:03,wallstreetbets,Probably not 100% gains but wouldn’t be shocked to see a surge (no pun intended)
2021-05-03 12:30:24,wallstreetbets,"I agree with that. It would be key. Waiting to see what happens with LDI. I think the best scenario is RKT does something nice like a buyback, increase dividend, or something along those lines."

2021-05-03 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Is NKLA undervalued or insignificant - My Nikola Clear Up  People seem confused about Nikola’s worth. Let’s try to clear things up. 

To get into the EV stocks, best thing is to understand a bit about EV’s.

What’s the difference between: electric vehicles, powered electric vehicles and plug-in vehicles?  Also what is the difference between hydrogen vehicles and electric vehicles? So, here is a simple explanation. 

**Electric, power electric and plug-in are all the same**: They run on electricity,  use a lithium battery and **need to be re-charged by plugging them into a socket.** 

**The hydrogen vehicles are also electric.** But, instead of a lithium battery, they have a hydrogen tank that produces the electricity. So they are similar to regular vehicles in that, **when needed, you fill up the tank, just, instead of gas, you fill it up with hydrogen.**

**Pros of hydrogen vehicles?** It takes five minutes to fill up the tank.There isn’t a “range” problem with them. In theory, you can drive them very long distances as long as you have a hydrogen station along the way.

As opposed to lithium batteries. You can drive a Tesla about 200 miles before you need to recharge it. Yep, Tesla will tell you it’s 400 miles, but practically, it’s 200 (400 would be if you are driving alone, no passengers, in a straight line with nothing stopping you all the way, (like a traffic light) or slowing you down (like slopes, curves, bad weather). 

This is a HUGE difference. Think about it. 200 miles is a 3 hour drive at 70 miles per hour. If you have a 4 hour drive, you will need to recharge the battery for AT LEAST one hour, and probably way more. Your 4 hour drive just turned into a 7-8 or more hours…And that is IF you have where to charge along the way.

A hydrogen car you just need to refill the tank and be on your way. That sounds awesome. 

**Where is the catch**? Well, there are about 40000 electric charging stations in the USA. That is a solid number when compared to a bit over 100,000 regular gas stations. So, if you own an electric car, you have a decent chance of charging it. Although it might take you 4-8 hours, don’t forget. 

Meanwhile, there are like...wait for it...45 hydrogen stations in all of the USA. So, basically, if you have a hydrogen car (you don’t, it’s really experimental at this point), you don’t have where to fill up your tank. 

The other problem with hydrogen vehicles: to “produce” the hydrogen, you need power. It doesn’t just “exist”. So you need to “manufacture” it, so to speak. Nowadays, that costs too much. That is ONE reason Elon Musk says hydrogen cars are stupid. (He is only right as long as making hydrogen remains expensive…)

**But electric cars also have some important issues:**

You see, creating electricity has a price. That price depends on how you create that energy. Some electricity is super cheap, like that created using the sun, the wind or even nuclear energy. Others are expensive. Some countries have lots of electricity, others don’t. Some can create clean electricity. Others need to pollute the air in order to make electricity.

So 1st problem: electricity. If all cars would be electric cars, it would be a HUGE problem to provide electricity from a plug to all of them. In most countries or states, that wouldn’t work at all.

2nd huge issue with all electric cars: where to charge them. If you live in a house, have a garage, no problems. You come home, plug it in, go to sleep, in the morning the car is charged. 

But if you live in an apartment building, if you park your car in the street,  if you are too busy cause when you get back from work, you son/wife etc. take the car to do shopping, night studies, night job, whatever, when and where are you going to charge the car?

Bottom line: the biggest problem with electric CARS is that if everyone will have them, it will eat up too much electricity, there will be nowhere to charge them, and even worse, no time to charge them. Not everyone can have an electric car, gas cars aren’t disappearing that quickly. Too many private electric cars are going to become a huge headache. 

But trucks on the other hand….let’s think about it. Everyone wants to make electric trucks (or large vans) why? Well, it’s a smaller, more manageable fleet.  They are parked at designated spots or parking lots, easier to charge in that sense, the gas/money you save by turning a truck electric as opposed to a car, is much larger, and the truck brings in revenue so that even if it’s expensive, companies can offset that cost. 

**So now we understand:** 

1. Electric cars are awesome cause they are friendly to the environment, easy to maintain, and as soon as the lithium batteries become less expensive (they will, technology is making them cheaper by the day), you will be able to afford one!
2. Electric cars aren’t THAT awesome because it takes time and lots of electricity to charge them. Good luck doing a movie about a road trip using an electric car. You’ll have plenty of shots of people waiting at a charging station and making small-talk…
3. Hydrogen cars can solve the charging issue except that there are no hydrogen fill up stations (almost) and hydrogen is expensive as a solution right now.
4. The private electric car market is huge and awesome, just not as huge and as awesome as Elon Musk wants you to think it is.
5. Trucks are actually a better market for electric vehicles in the mid-term / current long term outlook. Whoever makes a good electric truck/van is going to be in an excellent position.
6. Equally, whoever develops hydrogen fueled cars best, will have an upper hand. 

**Which brings us to Nikola**. And what it has or doesn’t have. One could argue that Nikola is just a bunch of ideas. And nothing else. 

But that isn’t accurate. 

They actually have several patents to their name. Some of them are more related to visuals. What the truck would LOOK like. But others are about real technology. This is a big deal in a field that is all about new technology. If you own some of the concepts of how to transform that idea into a product, if you own that patent, then that can be worth a lot of money.

Nikola is suing Tesla for using some of its patents (the ones related to how the truck looks, not how it runs). Though the lawsuit has been ongoing for years and might keep going for a few more years, down the road it seems very probable that Tesla will need to pay Nikola a sizeable payday.

So Nikola has some value because of its patents, it’s a real player in this new technology. 

The 2nd thing we know for sure is Nikola is building a factory, and that factory is in fact being built, and it will start producing something, pretty soon. We need to understand what that something is....

Nikola is aiming at building an electric truck. So is Tesla. Also Ford, Daimler, Volvo...this is a market where many big names want to make a splash. And then there is Rivian. They have a 100,00 truck order (!!) from Amazon. And their IPO is coming out this year. 

**So now that we are EV “experts”, what is Nikola worth?**

No one has a reasonable, practical EV truck (maybe except BYD. But I don’t trust Chinese companies, because they do not operate with transparency, they’re fishy to me). Whomever gets a good EV truck on the road is bound to see a pretty nice spike in stock value. 

Rivian is planning on an IPO setting its initial value at 50 billion. Mind you, this is a company that has a 100,000 truck order for a truck that doesn’t exist yet. Its development is advanced, and they are hoping to deliver the truck to the market in the next few months. But 50 billion, considering this number can easily go to 70 as soon as the IPO is launched, is a lot of money. 

Nikola’s current value is at 4.5 billion. They are building a factory, they have hired many, many professionals, they have patents that show they understand the technology very well, they have experience building the prototypes (through which they got the patents). They are potentially a very, very cheap stock. 

Just news of the factory actually working and any kind of initial pre-order doubles the price of this stock. Hold it for 2-3 years, the chances for a tenfold valuation is reasonable. 

As far as Nikola’s hydrogen trucks. I wouldn’t bet on it. They need to set up the infrastructure to have hydrogen stations for filling up the tank at a national level. That is just billions of dollars in costs. They need to create the technology that lowers the cost of providing the hydrogen. That still doesn’t exist at a satisfying level. I wouldn’t build on that as an investor. If they do somehow get that going, their value increases through the roof. But if they start focusing on it too much, they could waste lots of money, like they have done before. 

**Bottom line:** NKLA isn’t as dead as people think, IMO. It has value, it has a real plan, it’s focusing on the right market (the trucks) and it will be worth way more. It isn’t going up anytime soon. But it’s a good time to get in. 

I’m not an advisor, I do not own NKLA stocks right now but plan on owning a position at some point in 2021. I just thought people would benefit from understanding this EV thing better."

I clearly wrote that they don't have any product. Also, this is not a technical analysis at all. It only explains what NKLA might accomplish. The latest professional analyst gave it a buy and target price with a 100% valuation, I think.

2021-05-03 16:24:22,wallstreetbets,"If I know anything about NOK, is that positive news either doesn't do shit to it, or it makes it lose value for some reason.

Today's gain is probably due to many retailers buying into it after last week's positive news, which means that today's movement was more of a case of the market demand driving the price up, instead of the stock itself accruing value.

Don't be too surprised if it goes down tomorrow, NOK is a long play, not something reliable you can day trade anyway."

There was a bit of time where I was trying to not pay attention to stocks because I was getting mad FOMO and already got burned a couple of times, must have happened in that window.

2021-05-03 09:49:34,wallstreetbets,"I like Disney, and I expect their share price will go up eventually, but I think it'll hover below $200 for a while. I'm in it for the long haul."
2021-05-03 09:48:12,wallstreetbets,"Not too much in terms of DD for this play -- but I've been a pretty active trader for the past year, doing several intraday traders per day. One thing I've seen a trend on is mega cap names for the past few quarters having a big run into earnings.   


$DIS is set to report earnings on May 14th, it recently was sitting at $203 / share and dropped back down to $182 last week...around this time I started to buy, a lot of calls and some shares. I favored calls for this to give myself more leverage because I was highly confident that Disney would run in the next few weeks. I think with the parks opening up and the momentum of Disney + this has a chance to get back over $200 before earnings.   


Now what I've seen with many of the other mega caps, if they rip into earnings...and sometimes really rip in the AH. But the next day they just dropp off a cliff.

2021-05-03 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Time for you apes to grow your first wrinkle. Why I think a cucked generation of millenials will blow RKT's ER on May 5th to Uranus Alright, time for some grown-up DD. I've been busy with a side project I think folks here will like so haven't been posting too much but ya'll need to learn this.

**What drives stock price?**

Same thing as to why completely average girls on Twitch give you a boner. You had low expectations, and reality was somehow a little bit better

And what's the expectation for RKT right now? Pretty low

Mainstream news has been spitting the same fear, uncertainty, and doubt every week. Rising interest rates = less housing demand. And analysts have been expecting an EPS based on a hypothetical rate increase that the Fed constantly re-iterates will not happen until 2023 your goddamn CPI inflation basket of milk, eggs, and dildos be damned.

BUT. I believe RKT's Q1 ER on Wed, May 5th will be better than expected. And given the low volume these days, any surge in volume could cause some crazy spike.

**What makes you so confident?**

(1) Look at this chart of housing supply from Redfin. We are at an all-time low for active homes for sale in the US. Normally this would be worrying since it might mean less supply = less mortgages but...

[Source: https:\/\/www.redfin.com\/us-housing-market](https://preview.redd.it/luusztbl8vw61.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=09da688b17fa7ce9a26993de0c11c48d83d53671)

(2) Newly listed homes are on pace and trending like every year before it. So that means houses are still getting listed as usual, but every house that gets listed immediately gets gobbled up by buyers

[That dip in 2020 was due to COVID](https://preview.redd.it/atm8lsbl8vw61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f8bbf8afb44906ae9f3ee75712c2e633b803aa2)

(3) This is further evidenced by OFFICIAL [CENSUS.GOV](https://CENSUS.GOV) data that house buying is currently at an all-time-fucking-high

[Source: https:\/\/www.census.gov\/construction\/nrs\/pdf\/newressales.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/t0jsqep07vw61.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=55507ff8b3a649bd65834ab05fae7e61527e4e7e)

**But what about the future?**

True retards here are all too familiar with buying FDs for ERs only to become confused beggars when all the numbers beat but it still crashes. That's because ERs are never about past performance, but about future guidance.

""Yeah, and since this 2020-2021 mortgage/refinance craze is just a temporary thing due to COVID, the future is bleak for RKT!"" I hear an overpaid hedge fund intern with 3 MBAs exclaim like Archimedes shouting ""Eureka!"" down the street naked

That's where I also think RKT and the market will surprise us.

I strongly believe there is an entire generation of cuckolded millenials who are finally buying houses after years of pursuing ""experiences"" and ""living with friends"" in ""the big city where there are real jobs that require but don't require my college degree"" which is causing a bottleneck / zerg rush to the rest of the country all buying houses at once.

Just fucking look at these top 10 fastest growing metros from Redfin. Fucking BOISE IDAHO? These scream to me as ""I tried to make something of my life in my 20s in the city but never got anywhere and now I'm in my 30s/40s and give up and need to adult and this is the only place I could afford something so I can feel like I achieved something"". Accelerated by COVID.

RKT is the second-largest lender for FHA and VA loans, of which I also suspect many of these are.

**What else?**

For folks new to the mouth-gaping awe that is Rocket Companies' bulgy thick-veined protruding member, here's a quick rundown:

* **Profitable** \- For the full-year of 2020, Rocket Companies generated $16.9 billion of adjusted revenue and $11.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA ([source](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/26/rocket-companies-inc-rkt-q4-2020-earnings-call-tra/#:~:text=For%20the%20full%2Dyear%20of,up%20a%20record%2Dsetting%20year))
* **Special dividend** \- RKT issued a special dividend of $1.11, roughly 4.5%, only 7 months after IPO on 3/8/2021. That's a ballsy move and shows they got money to spare
* **Buyback** \- RKT also announced a $1 billion stock buyback program back on 11/10/2020 ([source](https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/michigan/2020/11/10/quicken-loans-rocket-companies-third-quarter-profits-buyback/6239432002/)). We don't know when or if it's been deployed yet, but again it shows an insane amount of confidence in your cash flow to do something only 3 months after IPO
* **Advertising** \- RKT has also started investing heavily in sponsorships and advertising, again to appeal to millenials. They sponsored the [Super Bowl](https://www.quickenloans.com/press-room/2021/01/07/rocket-mortgage-super-bowl-squares-sweepstakes-returns-for-super-bowl-lv-after-awarding-1-75-million-in-last-years-big-game/) with a contest and commercials, an [Indy 500](https://racer.com/2021/04/01/paretta-lands-rocket-pro-tpo-backing-for-indy-500/) car, and also sponsored the [100 Thieves League of Legends Training Room](https://youtu.be/h4SMSCKOXO8?t=59) for some fucking reason. I think they're just flexing at this point
* **Auto** \- It also looks like RKT has launched early access to their Rocket Auto platform ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/mz14jr/rkt_auto_looks_like_rkt_has_launched_early_access/)). Credit to [u/amru\_ons](https://www.reddit.com/user/amru_ons/) for the find. Carvana is currently worth 49.16B which is MORE than RKT at 44.55B which boggles my mind.

**What do the naysayers say?**

* **I thought RKT mostly did refinances?** I don't believe RKT has ever disclosed exactly what % of their revenue comes from refinances vs mortgages but regardless, the refinance boom has armed the company with tons of cash to transition the company into the Amazon of loans aka the next great FinTech company
* **Why has the stock been pinned flat ever since IPO?** Honestly, I don't know. Some people speculate not enough float and that Dan Gilbert owns \~92% so banks are crushing the stock to screw him but I don't really follow that logic.
* **Wat about mah short squeeze?!?!** Sadly, I do believe the squeeze has already been squoze and sadly it was only a 1-day affair. Short interest was at \~45% going into March 1st spike but now is only 7.56%. But the good news is that this can finally rise naturally like so many IPO companies do 6-9 months after IPO

**Positions or ban**

Still got my 73,652.485 share of RKT all in. I re-invested all my dividends via DRIP that's why there's the awkward fractional shares I can't figure out how to get rid of which breaks the UI. The average cost is $24.12 and current price is overflowed by the UI.

[My fractional shares broke the shitty TD Ameritrade UI](https://preview.redd.it/uqslmda97vw61.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84cdd0e04b1e8ca4cdcd0012436029d9eec82b6c)

For further proof of my diamond hands, here's the graph showing my hold from $1.7M up to $3M back down to $1.66M now.

[Remember: 8 digits or bust](https://preview.redd.it/1vwgais97vw61.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4583346a3cc087529f2230b8b394c28df4efed2b)

2021-05-03 16:33:12,wallstreetbets,"I just want to point out the reason Boise, St.

2021-05-03 19:14:48,wallstreetbets,"Idahoan here. The bit about Boise is not an accurate assumption. Idaho is being flooded with Californians not millenials. They are causing a housing crisis here because they show up and drop cash bids well over the ask, causing massive pricing spikes. Its not millennials either, many older californians as well. Dont need a mortgage when you pay cash."

also I'm one of those millennial schmucks who spent a year of mortgage payments on lattes and am finally bailing on the city for the burbs and agree with this assessment totally. people are also flush with cash from the last year and ready to buy houses. as more people get vaxxed they are also going to be more comfortable opening their homes for listing. the demand for homes is going to continue through this whole year for sure, dont listen to the FUD about a housing bubble.

That is not going to happen again based on the numbers it currently has. There is no squeeze here. Ya'll will be lucky if it has a little run up to $26 after earnings.

2021-05-03 18:55:41,wallstreetbets,"Depends, Condos, and Apartments, the bidding war is small, and the YoY appreciation is small as well, so there's really not much competition in those type of properties compare to SFH, but those gets good rent income, especially corporate rentals. Bid on 6 is alot? When I was shopping for home several years back, I bid on 20, and eventually double my budget.

Fund buying SFH to rent out? That's like a money losing business, but buying up condos, those I believe it has been going on for years. So the assumption that SFH are being bought by funds is completely wrong......

Where I live, in our housing division, we have been getting monthly letters from people wanting to buy homes in our division and asking if anyone is planning to sell. That's the level of scarcity it is right now. This is also due to the fact home building have slowed down since COVID, and new homes quality have been deteriorating driving people to buy older homes.

And another double standard is assume boomer is enjoying it. Does one take some time to think that when the boomers were teenagers? Prices back then is also way lower? Do they bitch about it complaining that the older generation stole from them? Get real, stop blaming the older generation."

2021-05-03 18:33:52,wallstreetbets,"On Wednesday March 10, GME was on a steady climb as it went from $139 (previous Friday close) to almost $350 around noon on that day. Then around 12:10-15 it started tanking hard all the way down to $172 hitting volatility halts 4 times before bouncing back to around $260. The price drop was most definitely not natural, as that kind of drop simply does not happen naturally unless a company releases bad news during market hours.

The MarketWatch timetravel jokes are because a few news feeds showed a MarketWatch article with an 11:55 (IIRC) publish time talking about the 40% drop of GME. That was before it happened. The specific article was either deleted or edited, and the version accessible on their website had a publish time of 12:40, which was a few minutes after the drop reached the bottom.

There's no definitive proof that I've seen as to what truly happened. Posts I've seen are from people that noticed the headline and it's time after the drop happened, so it's unclear if it was some weird timestamp shenanigans from news feeds (but then the minutes of the publications don't match) or some writer at MarketWatch in bed with Citadel or whoever actually accidentally jumped the gun and published the article before they should have."

# Revenue and Earnings Beat

Net sales rose 3% year-over-year to €5.08 billion ($6.2 billion), beating the FactSet consensus for sales of €4.75 billion. The sales beat was driven by growth in Nokia’s mobile networks unit — due to strong sales of 5G equipment — and its network infrastructure segment.

Citi analysts expected the “very strong” revenue and operating profit beat to drive significant upgrades to 2021 consensus forecasts. They noted that while the guidance remains unchanged, management said the first quarter provides a solid base for hitting the higher end of its 7% to 10% operating margin range. They maintained a neutral rating on the stock with a target price of €3.55.

# NOK's 5G segment gains traction

Nokia has been working globally to deploy its 5G solutions. **The company was recently** [**determined**](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/04/28/nokia-ranked-as-number-one-in-5g-patents/) **to have the most number of essential 5G patents of any operator by independent analysts at PA Consulting.**

* 5G mobile networks services expected to increase 5-8 percent by end of 2023.
* Restructuring plan that prioritized mobile networks – including 5G – along with wired infrastructure (fiber), cloud and network services, and Nokia technologies.
* NOK is deploying a 5G network in the UAE in conjunction with Etisalat, a major telecom operator in the emerging markets sector.
* Partnering with Telefonica Spain to help deploy 5G service to Spain's residents by upgrading the telecom's IP network.
* NOK will work with NewCore Wireless to use the Tribal Educational Broadband Service (EBS) to deploy wireless broadband connectivity – including 5G – to rural and underserved Native American communities.
* New MIMO radios coming soon
* Dish Network is going to be using NOK's NetGuard solution for their cloud native open RAN 5G wireless network (this is HUGE) - cred: u/BATTLECATHOTS

When huawei gets foothold positions in western telecom companies it pushes other industry to make own private networks. Whats the best place to buy your equipment for that? :) nokia has double digit grow for private networks. 

Bonus thing is that there is major movement to stop huawei's western expansion. Very bullish for long term investment in nokia imho. (I have 1871 shares)."

The market is just now beginning to recognize the ignored value that Nokia is beginning to showcase. 

This is a turnaround story without a doubt. 

I have a significant position in NOK and am steadily buying more."
2021-05-03 10:28:15,wallstreetbets,"$10 ??? NOK going to $25 by end of the year. Don’t forget, they just getting started, at $5 you would be stupid not to take your kids savings and buy NOK."

2021-05-03 13:25:21,wallstreetbets,"I did some technical analysis on the YTD graph, and there will be a first resistance level at around $5.25. I think if bulls can push through that resistance, bulls could make it to $10. But there will be a lot of resistance to $10 since I’m sure people from late January are trapped at the top wanting to break even. Let’s bet everything in this though!🦍"

2021-05-03 10:19:47,wallstreetbets,"I doubt it'll break 6. Nokia notoriously trades sideways. If it does break 6, it'll consolidate back down below 6 very quickly."

2021-05-03 15:01:13,wallstreetbets,Do you realize how many shares there are? That ain't happening anytime soon
2021-05-03 10:44:55,wallstreetbets,That’s too bad. You’re going to miss massive gains this year and next as Nokia flexes its newfound technology giant muscles.
2021-05-03 09:19:18,wallstreetbets,So what? Market Cap counts!
2021-05-03 11:47:25,wallstreetbets,"Right, and that was due to their failure to adapt to the new smartphone wave. 

Now, they are basically an entirely different company. They aren’t wholly dependent on phone sales, not even close."

2021-05-03 12:54:15,wallstreetbets,That is true

2021-05-03 12:54:58,wallstreetbets,Will there be a buyback?
2021-05-03 12:36:44,wallstreetbets,"They've had the option to buy back since before 2018, google it."
2021-05-03 17:53:46,wallstreetbets,Right!
2021-05-03 18:40:44,wallstreetbets,Yeah. You are correct
2021-05-03 11:27:36,wallstreetbets,nah... reverse split seems nice. but.... I've been burned in the past. buy back is the best option.
2021-05-03 13:19:30,wallstreetbets,Why would that help
2021-05-03 17:28:26,wallstreetbets,"No reverse split just buybacks!!! Be smart a reverse split is not going to happen, it makes zero sense! Buy them back and retire them."
2021-05-03 13:35:20,wallstreetbets,"It causes an increase, the more outstanding shares the company has, the lower the price. From what people above are saying 550million will be bought back, which is very good news."
2021-05-03 13:34:26,wallstreetbets,Increase! :)

2021-05-03 10:32:50,wallstreetbets,"Another route is to buy back shares.  Even a little bit would create a good precedent and push the price higher.  But from what I can tell based on comments from NOK employees, the company is very poorly run and moral is quite low so I don't expect much."
2021-05-03 15:37:21,wallstreetbets,I believe dividends will come back next year

2021-05-03 16:03:05,wallstreetbets,way to go! I have 100 shares at $4.20.

2021-05-03 09:44:39,wallstreetbets,"This is going sideways, I guarantee it."
2021-05-03 11:49:42,wallstreetbets,"True true. I wouldn’t bet on any immediate success but I can see them performing well in the next couple years, maybe 50-100% gains in 1-2 years if they come up with something super innovative or if they get some good contracts. The one thing that would worry me is if the current Bull market stalls or crashes, or if interest rates increase, as that would make R&D substantially more difficult"
2021-05-03 16:28:38,wallstreetbets,Same i have leaps so ill keep holding until we moon. Make sure you wear your seatbelt we have a bummy ride ahead of us lol 🚀🚀
2021-05-03 12:57:24,wallstreetbets,"Yes, all shareholders voted on it like a month ago. So they will buy back up to 550million dollars worth of shares at whatever the market price is at the time. They already said they will be doing it sometime hopefully in the near future"
2021-05-03 12:41:12,wallstreetbets,"Okay let me re-phrase this because you’re pushing back.. they had a vote, where all share holders decided that Nokia WILL be buying back 550million worth of shares. A decision made by share holders in a vote that I personally was a part of. So it IS going to happen. It’s not an “option” or  an “if” it’s a fact. Maybe try googling 1x more ;)"
2021-05-03 11:32:02,wallstreetbets,Fair enough. Hope they buy back then. I have 50 leaps in 2022 and 2023
2021-05-03 17:21:20,wallstreetbets,Burned how?
2021-05-03 15:55:54,wallstreetbets,It wouldn’t. He doesn’t understand what it means.
2021-05-03 11:21:44,wallstreetbets,Was definitely run poorly. New CEO last August has been the reason for all the smart moves lately though
2021-05-03 15:49:18,wallstreetbets,"I think they will give a small one just this year.

Just to improve the outlook.  :)"
2021-05-03 14:33:40,wallstreetbets,Watch out for Belgian detectives!
2021-05-03 11:04:44,wallstreetbets,Lol you must not watch Nokia much.

2021-05-03 12:59:42,wallstreetbets,"The one counter point is that Nokia as a company is doing different things, so you would expect different results from it's stock. 

But company stock values today, especially tech stocks, seem to be completely unrelated to what a company actually does, so who knows how Nokia's business practices will translate into for valuation."

This was the original proposal. The vote is done and shareholders chose to have a buy back. Will happen, don’t know when... but definitely happening. Idk why no one is aware.. but on the other hand if I was them I wouldn’t want to pay $10.00 for the share I think they want to keep it quiet and buy them back at a lower cost :)"

2021-05-03 14:22:15,wallstreetbets,Oh shit yes
2021-05-03 13:41:15,wallstreetbets,Preferably when the stock price dips I'm assuming? After being pretty stable this past month or so my NOK investment has risen 16.43% (at time of typing) in the past week so I guess they won't be buying back soon?

2021-05-03 13:38:55,wallstreetbets,I got 5$ calls for 2022.

2021-05-03 13:57:34,wallstreetbets,"thanx,  i think when CEO said something like ""our competitors are ahead of us"" he thought about keeping price low for buyback"
2021-05-03 13:49:57,wallstreetbets,"I have no clue when, I just know it’s coming. I would assume they want the cheaper cost, they will be buying at whatever the current market value will be."
2021-05-03 17:31:41,wallstreetbets,Received an email through webull because I was a shareholder then. The vote was on many things not just a buy back but that was part of it. I got the email 3/11 couple months ago. Been holding $NOK for months :)
2021-05-03 14:02:24,wallstreetbets,Buy back or not this is an undervalued company I don’t think it matters as much as you’re trying to make it seem.

Undoubtedly the price will jump once they announce it’s been completed. And for all we know they’ve already been doing it."

2021-05-03 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"(HAE) Haemonetics long term play Hey guys, 

so ive been looking at $HAE  for a while this company makes plasma collecting machinery and other technologies related to blood collection as well as software for managing the machinery and collection data. Recently the stock dropped almost 50% due to losing a client (CLS  pharma) since they are trying to make their own products witouth the need for plasma. I should addd that plasma collection is not limited to use CLS pharma is ussign it gfor (crating medication), so even if CLS found a new way to create their product it wouldnt affect palsma market too much ( there is a lot more usage in other areas).

This client represented 12% of their revenue (also the contract only ends by the end of 2022), plasma business seems to be on an upswing as countries start to open up more and more plasma collection is seen as less of risk.

My question is dont you guys think this stock dropped far more than its worth, my DD is fairly limited but seems like  a good bet.

Apreciate any feedback.

Have a good one."
2021-05-03 10:12:34,wallstreetbets,I have no insights to give you but looking at the stock's history I feel like it's severely undervalued right now. I'm holding but keep in mind I'm no expert either. It's been holding around the 66-68 mark and I feel like the trend is upward from here. It may take a while but I'm willing to hang around. Any return beyond current numbers is a WIN.
2021-05-03 10:40:13,wallstreetbets,"I've been watching it since it dropped. I caught it on the ""biggest loser"" board.i feel the same way, that it'll rebound at some point.

Today we have a couple of PMI reports, starting with manufacturing at 0945 and ISM manufacturing out at 1000. The Chicago PMI on Friday posted its strongest reading since 1983 (not a typo). Factory gate prices rose to their highest level since 1980. There appears to be a clear manufacturing boom happening in this country. And also inflation, which the Fed calls transitory.

Speaking of the Fed, we get a speech from Chairman Powell at 1430. Not expecting him to say much if he didn’t deviate from his commentary last week.

Also a ton of earnings. Lowe’s just came out with a beat on EPS. Reopening trade companies Wynn Resorts and Avis are out later.

Amid all the Sturm und Drang (German expression) April was a strong month for risk assets. Inflation is certainly here but if the Fed doesn’t care (yet) then it stands to reason that things should continue to go higher."

* when you ask your employer for a raise to combat inflation they say ""sorry son, no raises this year, still recovering from covid"". 

&#x200B;

So you are sitting here, with your 200/month rental price increase notice, trying to escape but you can't because the shed you want to buy is now 450K a year versus 350K last year, all the while not getting any more cash flow because your employer is using covid is an excuse, and your stocks keep falling.

ARKQ has fallen off it's February ATH, but has bounced along a trend line that extends back to March 2020 low.

[https://imgur.com/a/1TMYpaS](https://imgur.com/a/1TMYpaS)

I’m hoping for at least a bounce off the trend line to at least $85, and then looking for a run back to $90 after the consolidation period resolves itself

June 100 calls are $.30, and are a VERY inexpensive entry for a 45DTE position that is setting up nicely."

2021-05-03 12:05:38,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit I just got the OPPOSITE of margin called!!

1) my dumb ass thought APHA/TLRY were merging next week, not this week.

2) I bought 2 $14.5c exp 5/7 for APHA.

3) those 2 options were weird magical non-standard TLRY options this morning, but my account isn't approved to trade non-standard.

4) TD Ameritrade wouldn't let me sell to close OR exercise them at market open, when they were actually profitable.

5) I called customer support and to make things easy, I just asked to get both options exercised right away so I could dump the 166 shares (it was still above $18 at this time), and not have a short position or anything (again, I'm not qualified for that trading for GUH reasons).

6) not only did they super-admin approve my stuff, they short-sold me the 166 shares to lock in my price, they're exercising the options on my behalf, which zeroes out the short position I have no business being in.

7) AND THEN GET THIS. They're further refunding me a few hundred bucks, because according to them ""we have record of when you tried to close the position, so your refund is the difference between the stock proce at that time and the price now"".


Calls on TDA, yo. My tiny ass meme account just got some love."

Ok, imma try to help you autists out here today with something I say every time:

Buy a $SPY call right before JPOW starts talking.

Sell it when a massive hulk dick appears.

Buy a $SPY put when he's about 70% done talking

Sell it about 6 minutes after a reporter asks him a diversity and inclusion question and causes a massive red hulk dildo.

Every  time I say this, every time y'all think I'm joking and, every time, it  happens.  Don't believe me? Go look up spy on his speaking days

&#x200B;

Keep in mind I was saying this hearsay when TSLA was going nuclear and was told that I’m an idiot and the market doesn’t care about fundamentals. Well if you bought TSLA this calender year you’ve lost a lot of money (in a year where indexes are up). Also it’s strange how just about every sector is made up with stocks with similar P/E ratios, and “growth” stocks have high P/E ratios while safe dividend stocks have much lower P/E ratios.

2021-05-03 15:45:45,wallstreetbets,"ARK had been trading sideways for many years until we had a speculative boom last year and ARK funds exploded because they all mostly consisted of speculative stocks, Cathie was seen as a genius. And now that the speculative rally is slowing down and money is being taken away from speculative stocks, ARK is going back to its real worth and is facing a huge correction. Cathie was a genius only becuase of circumstance, the market got crazy and loved speculative risky stocks, and her funds that consisted mostly of speculative stocks just happened to be what the market loved & so that made har funds explode. Now that money is being taken away from speculative stocks and we're going back to normal, she will be seen for what she is, someone who was lucky enough that the greatest stock market bull-run just happened to love her type of stocks. That's it. Not a genius, circumstantial luck."

My theory is that they posted it before the presentation as they know the stock price would go down, which would incentivize people to buy the stock after the presentation.

This is a company making a bet that people want to maybe get the chance to spend hundreds of dollars to sit with a therapist and do (the active ingredients of) shrooms later when they can just do shrooms for tens of dollars now and skip the therapy bill.

Did legal recreational/medical weed increase the number of users and thus the market for weed? Sure. But weed has always had broader appeal than shrooms, it took a long time to get there, and now that we're there, dispensaries still have strong black market competition. If anything, growing shrooms is *easier* than growing weed.

If a whole lot of things go right for MNMD, maybe it is a successful stock pick years from now. But, IMO, it looks more like an OTC stock that has temporarily forgotten it's place."

2021-05-03 12:56:55,wallstreetbets,Fuck the chip companies. I think they’re sandbagging to run up the price on chips.

2021-05-03 13:28:52,wallstreetbets,"Ya of course, but why not just buy monthlies?"
2021-05-03 13:29:18,wallstreetbets,Buying weeklies is a bad idea in general. Lower volume means wider bid/ask spreads.
2021-05-03 13:29:59,wallstreetbets,"If you see a really obviously good opportunity then why not? You're basically saying buying a weekly option one week out, right?"
2021-05-03 13:30:13,wallstreetbets,"Well, yeah, that’s pretty confusing. 

Here you go:

“Should I buy weeklies over a week from expiration?”"
2021-05-03 13:30:31,wallstreetbets,"It's pretty weak weekly, avoid the weakly weeks."
2021-05-03 13:39:11,wallstreetbets,Probably not because most people are too stupid to understand what front running is and why its bad.

2021-05-03 13:58:44,wallstreetbets,"Because higher interest rates means higher financing costs, which hurts tech/growth more than other sectors because it's super leveraged"
2021-05-03 14:00:54,wallstreetbets,"Because most of them don't make money now, they will make money in the future. Future cash flows aren't worth as much in an inflationary environment. 

The simpler answer is this is just what growth investing is like sometimes. Everything went up a bunch last year and big money is locking in profits."
2021-05-03 14:01:03,wallstreetbets,"The first answer is correct. Also, the price of growth stocks is due in large part to future years’ earnings estimates. As inflation rises, the PV of those future earnings don’t appear so great"
2021-05-03 14:02:20,wallstreetbets,growth stocks are priced on future earnings. Inflation reduces the present value of future earnings.

1. *Expecting : Nokia devices and handwares in Future due to IOT and 5G.*
2. *Expecting : Nokia Cloud.*
3. *Expecting : Nokia satellites chips.*
4. *Expecting : Nokia wearables*
5. *Expecting : To continue paying dividends from FY 2022.  (0.2 cents/ quarter)*

**RISKS :**  semiconductor shortage next  2-  3 years.

2021-05-03 06:26:08,wallstreetbets,I think nok has way only up because there is no reasons to go down.
2021-05-03 04:48:38,wallstreetbets,"Afaik Nokia's main income is 4G/5G infrastructure equipment, and that business is not going great for them against other infra vendors like Ericsson (they're slow progress with new advances). Their other aspirations have not had much to show, and their brand is a shell of it's former self. It's a shame really, great company and I hope they pick it up, if I currently held I would stay."
2021-05-03 07:47:01,wallstreetbets,I thought the semiconductor shortage was likely to clear up somewhat with monsoon season in Taiwan - was I lied to?  That’s months not years.
2021-05-03 09:42:59,wallstreetbets,"This isn't  new however. Nokia already owned these patents, so an announcement they have them doesn't change anything, its priced in. Anyone who was operating in that space was already licensing rights for months / years, it's not new tech, it's not new patents.

I don't think anyone should bet on Nokia making wearables or their own IOT consumer level devices, they just don't have the name to compete in those spaces and they don't seem to be paying off too hard for the players in them, Apple, Samsung, etc. Wearables is also a space that hasn't done anything new in the last 3 years, it's just the same old watches with the same features with different bezels.

While I think Nokia is underpriced as they are a critical player in 5G, and hopefully the next big thing doesn't get announced soon, they aren't an exciting company to drive price and they are not doing anything groundbreaking to drive price."

2021-05-03 07:51:50,wallstreetbets,"Counterpoint - they sell quite a lot of equipment to Ericsson and Qualcomm.

A bet on Nokia right now is a bet on the new executive team. Nokia have the ingredients to do better than they are but it remains to be seen if they can execute."
2021-05-03 09:56:46,wallstreetbets,"Companies like Nokia and Ericsson have a small window of earnings of 3-4 years when new technologies are being deployed like 4G and 5G. They get orders from Telecom companies and after executing them there is not much income for both.   
Both companies need to diversify so that their income is less dependent on acceptance of new technologies. At the moment Ericsson is getting more orders for executing 5G infrastructure deployments and they have been diversifying at better pace than Nokia into a IT services company. Due to this, There is a credible threat that Nokia would be no more in 3-4 years even if they get new 5G orders as income would dry up in future. Also, Ericsson cannot buy/merge with Nokia due to competition law in US as Ericsson will have more than 70% market share if it happens, giving Ericson monopoly in this sector. I am really hoping that Nokia pulls it off though. They are a good company."

I actually like the stock but it's like a $13 to $16 value at a buyout of \~\~2B to 2.5B.. I think those die-hard ones are eating too much MNMD. I sold at 24 because I'm retarded, not stupid.

I mean, that earnings call was \*exactly\* what I expected as a fan of the company. And just as I figured would follow, WSB immediately said ""Thanks, I hate this."", shit their pants, and bailed."

2021-05-03 13:20:52,wallstreetbets,Ah I see. Thanks for replying. Never thought of buying them continuously on the way down. But to answer your question I would’ve just thrown everything at either the 25 or 22 strike and hope I get it and if I didn’t get assigned just chalked it up to missing an opportunity and move on

2021-05-03 14:14:02,wallstreetbets,"if you notice, I asked when would you have gone in on your puts, without seeing the future. If your crystal ball is that good to know that 22-25 range was the peak of this roller coaster \*before\* it hit that peak, you are going to do very, very, very, very well in this market. But I don't have a crystal ball, and I didn't know if it would peak at 20 or 40 or 100, so I entered at 20, bought a ton of cheap puts, some 12 and 14 and 16, and then when it crossed 25 on what looked like in sane volatility and resistance, I made those 22 and 25 puts. I based the decision on more 22s simply as the delta was really low and I made a very good guess that in the long run, the deltas would be in the -.95 or higher for the 22 and 25, making the 22s have a far better return. Also, you kinda have to do al this calculus and planning and speculating and buying on the fly while the price is moving around - emotions and math are hard to do at the same time. Anyways, I hope this helps you understand. The short short answer, is this will all make a lot more sense when you start doing this often."

2021-05-03 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GME, AAPL, TSLA, MVIS - All rolled into one company **Sony**

($SONY *formerly SNE*)

Given the GME interest, here is an investment idea.  Sony makes & sells games direct to consumers, without relying on a middle man (like Apple). Sony makes & sells the most sought after gaming machine - demand will likely exceed supply all year (at least). They're also into VR (and make & supply the small OLED displays that power VR headsets & viewfinders).

Sony has a well established music & movie studios.  They  recently signed large streaming deals with Netflix and Disney.

Sony is also the top producer of image sensors - from mobile phones (iPhone) to high end cameras (they also produce their own line of stills & cinema cameras and lenses) to industrial sensors for cars & other machinery (ahem MVIS).

In addition to car sensors, they are now road testing their own EV - way ahead of Apple and many of the recent TSLA-wannabe startups.  They are a key supplier for other companies (Apple, Nikon, Panasonic, et al.) and they use their parts for their own products (the competition helps to subsidize their own products like Samsung).

Sony is well-diversified, their product pipeline is promising, imaging & semi continue to grow and they are undervalued compared to many of their peers.

2021-05-02 22:59:52,wallstreetbets,I’ve been buying since it was $52 and I only have 19 shares cuz I’m a poor ape eating expensive name-brand crayons instead of great value crayons
2021-05-02 22:54:28,wallstreetbets,"I think it's undervalued also, but I can't read, so what the fuck do I know."
2021-05-03 00:44:31,wallstreetbets,"Didn't know Sony was also going into EV.  I hope their entertainment system and batteries will be great.  I don't know anything about their Autonomous Driving/A.I. efforts. They can design chips, just don't know much about their software side and user interface side.  Only recently have they started to improve their camera menu interface, after such a long time since the E mount Alpha cameras came out. Hope they will hire the right people to make those work.  Sony has a soft spot on many who grew up with their TVs, discman, and playstations. More recently, my favorites are cameras, and for a minority of people-high definition audio devices.  Even before Apple computers revamped to be cool again, Sony Vaio computers were the cool and powerful ones.  I look forward to see Sony fight back on other consumers products fronts."
2021-05-03 00:46:05,wallstreetbets,But dont you think Sony like Apple are kind of plateaued at their current price?
2021-05-03 01:29:38,wallstreetbets,I worked for Sony during its hay day 2000’s it’s stock hit what I believe was it’s all time high it went on a roller coaster ride down hill and it started going back up this year I think it’s a safe bet going forward but then you shouldn’t listen to me I eat crayons 🖍
2021-05-03 06:59:37,wallstreetbets,Sony is at an all time high up 300% over the last 5 years. Are they really doing anything to justify entering at 100ish per share with the expectation they will keep growing at this rate? And that they’re not peaking right now with a pull back expected at any moment/in the near future? At least they themselves are being honest saying the expect profits to slip after a boom during the pandemic.

AKA:  HNHPF also makes the parts for XBOX (MSFT).  and they are positioning themselves for 5G with patents.   True they are not listed on NYSE, you have to buy GDR through TD Ameritrade.  All true.  but i like the stock that makes the parts for the APPL iphone, and the parts for SONY playstation, and parts for MSFT xbox, many others, etc...

Secondly, their revenue was 6.4 billion, while their total costs were 6.7 billion. The costs were so high because they needlessly wasted a ton of money on an airplane and too many stores. With a few tweaks they could've easily turned a profit over 500million

I would continue listing but for timing purposes I'll stop there

# Dotcom bubble Vs. Current bubble

The NYSE advance has peaked and is now declining, even though the S&P and Dow continue higher or have went flat. This indicates that while the selective market indexes are moving higher, the broader market is struggling. Characteristically, our current financial markets fit the same picture as 1998-2002.

In 1998 the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in order to reduce the chances of an economic slowdown due to material and labor shortages. After this, money flooded the market resulting in the overvaluation of many equities and dotcom runup we saw prior to the bubble.  -  (*We can relate this to coronavirus stimulus and subsequent interest rate reduction)*

In the fall of 1999, with the market at ATH, the U.S. shrugged off the emerging-market crisis and the collapse of a large hedge fund(sound familiar?), the Fed reversed course and raised rates three times in 1999.  - (*We can relate this to the current market state, with many investors believing the market cannot go down, Bill Hwangs hedge fund seemingly brushed off, and federal reserve stating interest rates will be increased in the future.)*

Following this, in 2000 financial institutions informed their clients the tech stock were no longer undervalued and the dotcom bubble selloff began. - (*This is where I think we are heading this summer into 2022.)*

&#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**

To be clear, the outcome of the near term market relies heavily on how retail investors perceive current market conditions.  Its my belief that once the general public has enough pressure on the federal administration to fully reopen the economy then tapering will be announced, lenders will raise rates and hedging will begin... triggering the sell off.

2021-05-03 01:44:06,wallstreetbets,It's an interesting thing I've wondered about. People have noted the coin acting as a leading indicator of some market movements over the last year. I also would have intuitively guessed crypto would do well cuz of scarcity n shit. But the mirror movement feels like leverage to me. It makes sense if you get margin called to bail on the most speculative assets first. It makes me wonder how much leverage is in the crypto market. Idk but I'd assume a lot.

2021-05-03 00:44:05,wallstreetbets,"such as? 

granted a lot of the shit some companies are ""selling"" isn't worth a tenth of the valuation, but those companies are getting hammered pretty hard and pretty efficiently. ie getting called on their bullshit in very public ways and getting shorted to oblivion.

ie. nikola, (clover), hyliion, lordstown motors.

the democratization of information will make this next crash very interesting. in 1999, the internet was nascent and most retail investors had no idea wtf was going on with most websites or how to research ""web companies,"" so i really wonder if the crash will be more of an agonizing death to a bunch of retardedly valuated companies, who can no longer benefit from cheap credit rather. If that's the case, I welcome it.

I think people have not been really acknlowdging that the major drivers of the US economy aren't necessarily over valued or stagnant. The top 5 companies blew past all consensus earnings and there's no foreseeable downturn in demand for their actual products. They lost a few points because people were worried about weather they could ""grow any more."" Lol - if theres anything that's for sure, its that people will always want more. We keep trying to compare current valuations with past valuations, but the growth cycle of companies in the internet age has accelerated and forward looking P/Es need to accommodate. For example, the growth of FAANGs in the last decade has probably trounced all tech ever since its inception. Even tradition industries will accelerate as well. 

As for interest rates, even if interest rates rise 0.5% in this coming year, i dont really think it's going to do much when the major players have so much retained earnings that they are resorting to insane stock buybacks. EV pipe dreams may not get so outlandishly priced like TSLA, but most of the core american economy probably won't flinch. 5% versus 4% interest rate never stopped anyone from buying a cheeseburger, XBOX, F150, or new home."

I would buy stuff like VWO for safety (relative to US) but plan on holding for 20 years. Not typical WSB advice though. Emerging Markets are more undervalued so I expect 20 year return to be better. Of course the problem is if a correction does happen you will be down 50% in short term but in long term you will be up.

You don't have actual companies buying 1billion plus of BTC and ETFs opening as well as PayPal and the major credit card companies getting in the game. The ""it will go to zero"" is loong gone buddy."
2021-05-03 10:17:19,wallstreetbets,"That’s a good point... I’ve got VALE in my portfolio as a proxy for some materials, but so you know of any ETFs or funds that do copper backed by physical assets?"
2021-05-03 09:59:29,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't assume correlation between different markets (equities, oil, gas, etc). I didn't see anything on their site that points to that. But they can also be completely wrong."
2021-05-02 23:22:04,wallstreetbets,Thanks Billy Madison.
2021-05-03 17:20:44,wallstreetbets,My roommate Niel wants to know if you have an OnlyFans.
2021-05-03 16:17:09,wallstreetbets,"Art is the perfect example of something very expensive with no intrinsic value.

It will become worthless only when there is such a high demand and low supply in basic needs that people just don't care about anything but survival. But then again.. even money itself is likely to become worthless at that point.

Edit: And I believe what is true for art will be true for BTC too.
And after all the misery is over, it'll be worth even more."
2021-05-03 00:37:14,wallstreetbets,I definitely feel dumber after reading that

2021-05-03 11:05:58,wallstreetbets,"I just did the same. Question: I also purchased on Fidelity, so after the transfer is see 2 of every stock - the ones I bought on Fidelity and then the ones from Robinhood.

Is that normal? Or will they eventually merge?"
2021-05-03 11:13:05,wallstreetbets,Takes two days max people. The time to do it is now. Go through fidelity to transfer not RH
2021-05-03 11:23:28,wallstreetbets,"Very much worth it considering RH is a bunch of crooks. It is $75 but you don't pay upfront. It will just show as a negative cash value in your Fidelity acct until you sell, and will be taken out once you do so. I would imagine you can pay part of it at a time as well. I'm so glad I got the ball rolling., No doubt in my mind will as well."

So after a month I asked about cost basis info. TDA said RH never sent it. So I contacted RH, and RH said they sent it, TDA said it was never sent. RH sucks and I believe TDA. I messaged client services at TDA and they said I could give them the averages and cost basis info and they would enter it manually. Not sure about Fidelity but you would think they would also update cost basis info at your request."
2021-05-03 00:08:34,wallstreetbets,I’m a month deep and still no cost basis 😭😭💦
2021-05-03 03:35:11,wallstreetbets,I entered it manually. There's an option in Fidelity to do so.
2021-05-03 02:10:19,wallstreetbets,I don’t think it’ll ever be updated.  I’ve been waiting a long time.

2021-05-03 12:14:32,wallstreetbets,Good
2021-05-03 14:07:38,wallstreetbets,"Most UI's are copied, RH more than likely copied from anothers UI design. 

I worked as a tech for a security comp, and almost all security systems are copying each others UI's completely. And I mean to the point they just copy and paste the code and change the name that's on it lol, HIKvision is an example of a company that copies/steals UI's among other things."

2021-05-02 23:18:33,wallstreetbets,4lokos... Jesus.. a true degenerate right here
2021-05-03 01:57:18,wallstreetbets,What flavor? I used to fuck with the grape ones
2021-05-03 10:23:29,wallstreetbets,I can get you some of the original heart attack 4lokos that are illegal now
2021-05-03 05:43:21,wallstreetbets,🤣
2021-05-03 09:44:26,wallstreetbets,What's the reasoning people think this will blow up again? Genuinely wondering.
2021-05-03 11:59:26,wallstreetbets,That would be a rob in hood
2021-05-02 22:03:31,wallstreetbets,"Not quite. Robinhood boots you into a margin account if you trade options. When this guy transferred, Fidelity had to leave them on margin"
2021-05-03 16:17:14,wallstreetbets,I know it would say cash account I have fidelity
2021-05-03 09:40:00,wallstreetbets,Nope. My account says cash there
2021-05-03 12:33:45,wallstreetbets,"Yep, mine did the same the first day. Few days later they changed to cash."
2021-05-03 09:55:10,wallstreetbets,I like the way you invest
2021-05-03 09:59:19,wallstreetbets,Whats ur trade plan on entry & exit?Im very curious on the thought process as newbie
2021-05-02 23:15:23,wallstreetbets,i see thanks! and then call to change from margin to cash correct?
2021-05-03 11:13:12,wallstreetbets,did you initiate from Fidelity side or RH side?
2021-05-03 09:15:30,wallstreetbets,Isn't that true for every brokerage including fidelity?
2021-05-03 02:50:29,wallstreetbets,"You have to do in manually, unfortunately."
2021-05-03 09:16:11,wallstreetbets,That’s right!!!!!!!
2021-05-03 11:09:32,wallstreetbets,Its a full transfer. It said the expected date of completion was 4/29. So we are getting a little ridiculous at this point.
2021-05-03 11:07:55,wallstreetbets,"Great, I guess I'm just being impatient."
2021-05-02 23:21:15,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-02 23:36:21,wallstreetbets,Disagree!!! GME taking off first doesn’t mean it will go further. It just proves what’s possible
2021-05-03 17:41:14,wallstreetbets,"it took me like 4 days.  

&#x200B;

they didnt even charge me the transfer fee."

2021-05-03 12:33:01,wallstreetbets,"Basically, it's still massively shorted. Same reason people thought it would blow up the first time."
2021-05-03 19:08:11,wallstreetbets,Complete delusion.

2021-05-02 23:20:35,wallstreetbets,Is that why people don't like screenshots of opinions on robinhood?
2021-05-03 12:24:16,wallstreetbets,Sell on the way down
2021-05-02 23:19:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. They are nice about it. Long wait time though, so many people doing the same thing"
2021-05-03 11:33:24,wallstreetbets,Fidelity only. They take care of the rest
2021-05-03 12:11:48,wallstreetbets,"Probably. But Fidelity has $4.9 Trillion under management. Robinhood as $20 Billion. 

If market moves are going to cause a liquidity problem, it's going to hit Robinhood ***waaaay*** before Fidelity has to worry."
2021-05-03 09:28:17,wallstreetbets,"Looks like your pro-Robinhood, good luck with that"
2021-05-03 09:22:33,wallstreetbets,I don’t use either as they’re not available in my country. Just read the RH terms & conditions on here
2021-05-03 11:32:46,wallstreetbets,Full takes longer from what I hear. I'd call both brokers to check

2021-05-03 16:10:08,wallstreetbets,What if I have short-term memory issues? Is it still premeditated?
2021-05-03 18:11:20,wallstreetbets,I didn't write it down.  He did.

2021-05-03 12:00:23,wallstreetbets,That just changed everything of my childhood
2021-05-02 22:34:22,wallstreetbets,Itll switch to cash in a few days
2021-05-03 01:15:47,wallstreetbets,"When I switched from RH to Fidelity the same thing happened to me! 

I called Fidelity and they said it would take 2-3 days before the shares would switch from margin to cash. 

I waited a week and the shares still showed margin like your screenshot. Called again today, asking to check in on my request as it had been a week already. The were immediately able to switch it to cash this time. Like even before I got off the phone, they asked me to check my account again and the shares showed as cash. 

If you don’t see it soon, call them again until it switches."
2021-05-03 05:04:33,wallstreetbets,Probably not gonna be able to vote since you didnt have the shares in cash before the share recall.
2021-05-03 03:23:37,wallstreetbets,"its margin on the first few days, I think when account actually settles and they have the money, they automatically change it to cash account."
2021-05-02 23:49:34,wallstreetbets,They will switch to cash after he calls fidelity if bought with cash. RH are crooks and your account is margin. Check your statements.
2021-05-02 23:21:41,wallstreetbets,did you have to pay any fees to transfer? sry last question :)
2021-05-03 18:53:44,wallstreetbets,They made him do it.

2021-05-03 01:39:37,wallstreetbets,Ooh thanks for the heads up. I'll call them tomorrow
2021-05-03 06:54:16,wallstreetbets,Apes helping apes
2021-05-03 10:40:41,wallstreetbets,How would I switch from Robinhood to fidelity I’m new to all this?
2021-05-03 00:02:24,wallstreetbets,"I am sorry to sound stupid here but I am very new with this. I have a small RH account. So you guys don’t like RH? Can you please tell me why?
What does it mean to have a margin account vs cash account?
I am willing to leave RH, just want to understand. 
Thank you for your time.

UPDATE: I created a fidelity account. And just requested the transfer. Thank you everyone for your input."
2021-05-02 23:23:39,wallstreetbets,Yeah $75. Small price to pay to guarantee I can buy and sell when I want
2021-05-03 16:33:40,wallstreetbets,Trash can punch ftw
2021-05-03 00:07:14,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you actually own the shares you have on RH, as when they transferred over for me they were available to be loaned out.

Also RH restricted buying GME in Jan and then restricted selling of Dogs last month. Not safe to trust that you can buy or sell when you want to"
2021-05-03 14:53:05,wallstreetbets,On margin. Robinhood has access to lend your shares out.
2021-05-02 23:47:29,wallstreetbets,They will refund the $75 in a few weeks
2021-05-03 04:25:39,wallstreetbets,"Call them back if you care about the $75, they'll wave that shit at that account value (can't remember what the cutoff is, I've heard $2.5k and $25k, but it got waved for me above $25k)"
2021-05-03 00:09:45,wallstreetbets,"Alright.  I am transferring first thing Monday morning. 
I found a youtube video on how to to that. 
And yes, I know about the trade restrictions. 
Very disappointed.

2021-05-03 05:41:55,wallstreetbets,"Margin is an account where you can borrow money to control more shares. You pay interest payments on the loan for those shares. Magnified your gains, but also the losses. BE CAREFUL with margin.

Cash is ownership outright.


On margin accounts, many firms will loan out the shares you control to others so they can be shorted."

Fidelity is your friend right now, mostly free, mine even came with an extra account"

2021-05-03 14:15:38,wallstreetbets,Correct!
2021-05-03 10:59:17,wallstreetbets,Did it cost money?  I wanted to do this but then saw somewhere that it costs $75 to transfer your shares out.  :(  I dont have that much to waste.....and I only have a few shares.  I'm just wondering if its worth it.

Greetings fellow degenerates. I present to you an undervalued, contrarian play that would make Burry proud.

The DD is divided into four parts:

1. ViacomCBS: Company overview, management changes post-merger in 2019, and current digital transformation initiatives (Paramount+ and Pluto TV)
2. Death of a beached whale: Stock blow up.
3. Why VIAC is a fantastic buying opportunity in a severely overbought market: A behemoth trading well below its fair value.
4. My position.

# 1. Overview

ViacomCBS Inc. is an American diversified multinational mass media conglomerate formed through the merger of CBS Corporation and Viacom on December 4, 2019. The company operates over 170 networks and reaches approximately **700 million subscribers in approximately 180 countries, as of 2019.** It comprises of five major units:

&#x200B;

* **CBS Entertainment Group** consists of CBS-branded assets, including the CBS television network, CBS News, CBS Sports, CBS Studios, CBS Media Ventures, Big Ticket Television and CBS Television Stations. The unit also has a 50% interest in The CW television network joint venture co-owned by AT&T subsidiary WarnerMedia through its Warner Bros. division.
* **Domestic Media Networks** encompasses the pay television channels owned by ViacomCBS in the United States, such as MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime, BET, Comedy  Central, TV Land, Paramount Network, Logo, CMT, Pop TV, Smithsonian Channel, VH1, The Movie Channel, and Flix.      ViacomCBS Domestic also controls production facilities for the channels  listed above, including Nickelodeon Animation Studio.
* **International Networks** encompasses certain international versions of the company's domestic channels, as well as region-specific networks, such as Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, Network 10 in  Australia, and Telefe in Argentina. ViacomCBS International also owns a third of the Rainbow S.r.l. television studio in  Italy, as well as a 49% stake in the Viacom 18 joint venture with TV18. This unit also includes all CBS-branded channels across Europe, which are co-owned with AMC Networks International.
* **Streaming Group** focused on the global over-the-top streaming services and Internet properties. This division encompasses **Paramount+, Pluto TV, CBSN, CBS Sports HQ, BET+ and Noggin**.
* **Global Distribution Group** focuses on the global distribution of all programs produced by all ViacomCBS production studios. The division consists of ViacomCBS International Studios.

***Leadership***

ViacomCBS is headed by Robert Bakish.  Bakish holds a Bachelor of Science in operations research from Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science and also earned an MBA from Columbia Business School. He has been with Viacom (per-merger enitiy) since February 1997, joining initially as Vice President of Planning and Development.

**Head of international operations:** In January 2007 Bakish became President of MTV Networks International (MTVNI), overseeing all MTV Networks operations outside the U.S. He immediately restructured MTVNI, cutting 8% of the workforce in addition to merging some overseas units with the UK business and devolving responsibilities for Latin American operations to new offices across the region. He launched the popular Colors franchise of networks via the Viacom18 joint venture in the high-growth market of India. MTVNI had double-digit, year-on-year growth during his tenure.

**CEO:** In January 2011, Bakish was promoted to the newly created position of President and CEO of Viacom International Media Networks (VIMN). During his tenure, Bakish expanded Viacom's international footprint, and VIMN was Viacom's most successful division; revenue doubled, and VIMN grew to more than 200 television channels. Under his leadership, the Paramount Channel was launched, offering movies and television shows in Europe, Latin America and Russia. He oversaw the expansion of networks such as Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and Spike to an increasing number of foreign markets, and helped orchestrate the acquisition of Channel 5 in the UK and Telefe in Argentina. He also oversaw the launch of apps, including the Viacom Play Plex suite of branded mobile TV apps and the BET Play direct-to-consumer subscription video-on-demand app for an adult audience.

In October 2016, Bakish was named acting President and CEO of Viacom effective November 15, replacing interim CEO Tom Dooley. Simultaneously, he was also appointed President and CEO of the newly created Viacom Global Entertainment Group, combining Viacom International Media Networks (VIMN) with Viacom's Music and Entertainment group, which includes MTV, Comedy Central, VH1, Spike TV and Logo TV; two additional networks, TV Land and CMT, also joined the Global Entertainment Group. Optimistic that Bakish could make good on his plans to turn Viacom's core U.S. cable networks and its Paramount Pictures film studio around, the board of directors of Viacom Inc. made Bakish's appointment as President and CEO permanent on December 12, 2016.

In early 2017, **Bakish laid out a five-point plan to turn Viacom around and return the company to steady profitability**. This consisted of focusing on Viacom's six flagship brands: BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr. and Paramount; revitalizing content and talent; deepening distributor and advertiser partnerships to **drive traditional revenue; increasing digital offerings, consumer products and live experiences; and optimizing and energizing the organization**. The strategy also included having Paramount Pictures develop films and franchises connected to Viacom television content; additionally, Spike TV would be rebranded as and converted to a broad-based general entertainment channel, the Paramount Network, in early 2018.

By the fall of 2017 Bakish had restructured Viacom, replacing executives at nearly every company, including hiring Jim Gianopulos - formerly chairman and CEO of 20th Century Fox, as the new chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures.

**In 2018, Bakish's implementation of his five-point comprehensive strategy was credited with Viacom's much improved finances and improved company morale and focus**. In 2018, under Bakish's direction and in accordance with his plan to capture younger and digital markets, Viacom acquired digital platform WhoSay, internet video conference VidCon, and online television network AwesomenessTV. In early 2018, Bakish also announced the launch of an official Viacom streaming service, which will support ads and will include series and content from Viacom that hasn't been available on other streaming services. In April 2018, Viacom launched Viacom Digital Studios, which will create new original content hosted on sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat. In addition, later that June, Bakish announced that Viacom will produce some new series exclusively for Netflix, beginning with Nickelodeon related content.

Post merger, Bakish swiftly started streamlining and managing operating costs, especially during the pandemic. In May 2020, ViacomCBS initiated a round of post-merger layoffs across all parts of the company but primarily hitting divisions within the CBS Entertainment Group. The was part of a restructuring of various operations at CBS as part of the integration with Viacom, as well as nod to changes in the business including those related to COVID. Bakish has targeted $750 million in synergies from the combination and the company said it had eliminated 450 positions. That has risen as the year progressed. “Even before the coronavirus pandemic, we were already in a period of significant change to integrate our newly combined company – work that is helping us weather this crisis, creatively adapt and strengthen the resiliency of our business,” Bakish wrote. “It’s critical that we continue these efforts to integrate and evolve ViacomCBS to remain competitive now and for the future\*\*.  This means continuing to integrate and streamline our operations, manage our costs as diligently as we can, and follow through on our committed post-merger synergy targets.\*\*”

***Current operations and growth driver***

As noted above, one of the largest pay-TV service providers with a diverse portfolio of network subsidiaries, broadcast rights, and content library for all audience demographics. VIAC generates 37% of its Revenue from CBS (primarily CBS and CW Broadcast stations), 34% from Cable Networks (Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV), 11% from Paramount (movie and TV studio), 8% from Showtime, and 7% from Local Media (Owned and Operated affiliates). In terms of the type of revenue, 40% is advertising, 31% is subscription (or affiliate) fees, and 23% is from licensing content.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7pycluoxvsw61.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=70224b7981b50216a101f302b7fbfa7e3a9e32be

Streaming services are the key growth driver for VIAC. Although, the thesis isn't based on VIAC becoming a streaming powerhouse it's important to discuss where they can easily derive growth to exceed expectations. Currently, they operate two platforms PlutoTV and Paramount+. PlutoTV is a free ad-supported streaming TV service. It currently has 43M monthly active users with a management target of 100-120M by 2024. Paramount+ is a more standard streaming platform ($4.99 for ad-supported and $9.99 for premium). It leverages VIAC's deep content library, news subsidiaries, and is differentiated in its offerings of live sports Overall, streaming revenue is $2.6bn with a management target of $7bn by 2024 with 30M current subscribers and management targets of 65-75M subscribers by 2024.

Paramount+ has a very attractive kid-focused value proposition. This [article](https://www.fatherly.com/play/most-popular-kids-shows/) discusses the most popular kids' shows in 2021 and the top two are unsurprisingly **Paw Patrol and Spongebob Squarepants which are both owned by VIAC.**

Secondly, there is a differentiated live sports offering with VIAC having signed contracts with numerous major sporting events to be hosted on Paramount+. The service will feature **over 1,000 live sporting events per year**, including regular-season games, playoffs, championships and more across the following marquee properties: *The NFL on CBS,* The Masters, NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship, PGA TOUR and Championship, *SEC on CBS,* UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and UEFA Europa Conference League. **Paramount+ is the only place in the U.S. where soccer fans can find exclusive English-language coverage of every UEFA club competition match, every season.**

Management is aggressively focused on investing in growth initiatives leveraged to streaming platforms that are both subscription-supported and advertising-supported (as seen by their $3bn equity raise in late March. More on this in the next section).

VIAC has great streaming potential with significant differentiating features and **currently the market is not pricing in this potential growth.**

VIAC is unique in operating one of four broadcast networks in the United States. This market position enables broad distribution and large/well-diversified audience demographics. While ""cord-cutting"" is a key structural challenge, this business generates cash that can be deployed into growth businesses. **Secondly, the return of the theatrical business will serve as another source of both content and cash generation for VIAC as they continue to reposition their portfolio around streaming.**

***Non-core assets***

Non-core assets being sold is another potential source of significant cash. Some would be sale of CBS' headquarter building (\~$1bn), Simon & Schuster (sold for $2.2bn, expected to close in 2021), and CNET $500mn. **All combined this could potentially raise $3.0-3.5bn in cash.**

# 2. Death of a beached whale

As you all probably know by now, our boy Billy Hwang, a 57-year-old veteran investor, managed $10 billion through his private investment firm, Archegos Capital Management. He borrowed billions of dollars from Wall Street banks to build enormous positions in a few American and Chinese stocks.

By the beginning of this year, Mr. Hwang had grown fond of a handful of stocks: ViacomCBS, which had pinned high hopes on its nascent streaming service; Discovery, another media company; and Chinese stocks including the e-cigarette company RLX Technologies and the education company GSX Techedu.

Trading at roughly $12 a little over a year ago, ViacomCBS’s stock rose to about $50 by January. Mr. Hwang kept amassing his stake, through complex positions he arranged with banks called “swaps,” which gave him the economic exposure and returns, but not the actual ownership, of the stock.

By mid-March, as the stock moved toward $100, Mr. Hwang had become the single largest institutional investor in ViacomCBS, according a New York Times analysis of public filings. The people valued the position at $20 billion. But because Archegos’s stake was bolstered by borrowed money, if ViacomCBS shares unexpectedly reversed he would have to pay the banks to cover the losses or be quickly wiped out. On Monday, March 22, ViacomCBS announced plans to sell new shares to the public, a deal that generated $3 billion in new cash to fund its strategic plans (a very preudent decision by management considering the stock price at the time). Morgan Stanley was running the deal. As bankers canvassed the investor community, they were counting on Mr. Hwang to be the anchor investor who would buy at least $300 million of the shares. But sometime between the deal’s announcement and its completion that Wednesday morning, Mr. Hwang changed plans. The reasons aren’t entirely clear, but RLX, the Chinese e-cigarette company, and GSX, the education company, had both spiraled in Asian markets around the same time. Below are the main points of what happened after:

1. Archegos  was hit with a margin call.
2. Archegos  defaulted on their margin call and as a result liquidated their fund
3. The  total value of equity exposure was around $20bn
4. A fire sale began in the stocks that were the underlying security in the total      return swap
5. Banks were forced to sell their position in large block trades

**3.** **Value Opportunity With Incredible Risk/Reward Asymmetry**

A margin of safety is achieved when securities are purchased at prices sufficiently below underlying value to allow for human error, bad luck, or extreme volatility in a complex, unpredictable and rapidly changing world""

\- Seth Klarman, from his book ""Margin of Safety""

The opportunity to buy companies with a significant margin of safety is rare in our current stock market environment. However, ViacomCBS presents a unique value opportunity with the stock down over 58% over a one-month period with no material change in the underlying fundamentals of the company.

VIAC reported solid results in the recent Q4-2020 quarter.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2wdq9phowsw61.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=1729c4fd605a6eabc47e6f426d76194e658eb07f

While the whole focus is on transitioning the company to streaming, the company is doing it from a position of strength. Yes, the whole playbook revolved around the streaming subscribers.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1ox9ig5qwsw61.png?width=997&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f548399ec1815dfcbe31780f6ca792daf9953be

But VIAC was able to generate that growth while also generating tons of free cash flow.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bzhzoohrwsw61.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=eede156fcffbce3d1f04fa516e7b724e2636964f

VIAC also repurchased shares at a great price in 2020 and of course used the spike to reissue at a higher price. The proceeds will be used to further bolster Paramount+ and Pluto TV. Netflix achieved its success because of multi-billion-dollar investments in original content, which is a testament to the strong positive correlation between spending on content and subscriber growth. For Paramount+ and Pluto TV to achieve the expected success, ViacomCBS will have to invest substantial amounts in producing high-quality original content and also on securing broadcast rights to live sports events, and it makes sense for the company to raise funds when there is an opportunity in the market. The company has already announced a massive content investment goal through 2024.

Streaming is one of the most competitive, yet fast-growing business segments in the world today. A closer look at recent developments in the industry reveals the presence of a loyal follower base for a brand will not lead to immediate success in the OTT industry. For instance, Apple is struggling to gain market share in the OTT streaming industry although it has a wide follower base and a second-to-none brand value. In contrast, The Walt Disney Company has seen unimaginable success with Disney+. The differentiator is the expertise in content creation and the availability of marketing channels to take the streaming service in front of consumers who are likely to subscribe to a premium subscription service.

ViacomCBS is one of the largest pay-TV service providers in the world, and the company owns some of the most widely followed TV shows and networks. For example, MTV is considered a leading media brand that interacts with the younger population and has a reach of 450 million households in 180 countries. Nickelodeon is another media asset owned by ViacomCBS which has a massive reach. These media assets, the brand value associated with these networks, and the past success of the company in creating content that attracted millions of viewers, will all play an important role in the success story of Paramount+ and Pluto TV.

In 2020, Pluto TV, the ad-supported streaming television service, reported 43 million monthly active users, and I believe MAUs will continue to grow at a stellar pace in the next five years.

&#x200B;

[  Global Pluto TV MAUs](https://preview.redd.it/na560vmtwsw61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b5511fc46880a1046f93209e3b0576874bde7fe)

One of the major hurdles to success faced by the subscription-based OTT content streaming industry in emerging markets is the unwillingness of many consumers to pay a monthly fee to watch premium content. This has a lot to do with the median income levels as well. Because of this characteristic, the illegal pirate video services industry continues to thrive in high-growth regions such as Brazil, India, and many other Asian and Latin American nations. According to a recent study by Mint, India's OTT industry loses up to 30% of revenue to pirate video service providers. Pluto TV is primed for growth in international markets because of its ad-supported model as a result of the favorable demographics for this industry in emerging markets, which will be a catalyst for ViacomCBS's growth in the coming years.

Considering the growth opportunities available in the streaming industry, I believe the company management is correct in raising funds to meet the content investment requirements. As the streaming services gain traction, I am confident of a significant expansion in valuation multiples similar to what happened with Disney stock. As long as Disney remained a traditional media company, the company's shares traded at reasonable valuation multiples. However, the decision to restructure the business last October in a bid to prioritize Disney+ sent the stock soaring to new highs because of the positive sentiment of investors toward the OTT streaming industry. In the coming months, I expect a similar expansion in valuation multiples for ViacomCBS stock as well, along with the steady progress the company is expected to make in prioritizing the direct-to-consumer business.

A little over a year after Viacom and CBS merged, the company showcased an aggressive streaming strategy that includes relaunching CBS All Access as Paramount Plus on March 4, with a content pipeline that combines live sports, breaking news and a massive movie library as well as original films and series for the platform. The company also plans to leverage Pluto TV as a way to attract viewers to Paramount Plus.

“When it comes to streaming, we stand for something unique – an ecosystem of free, pay and premium streaming, underpinned in pay by the new Paramount Plus service,” said CEO Bob Bakish\*\*, adding that ViacomCBS nearly tripled its global streaming subscriber base and more than doubled its streaming subscription revenue over the past two years\*\*. “It’s a streaming service that will resonate with broad and diverse audiences and has a robust slate of originals which will only grow.”

The company had a stronger-than-expected Q4, due in large part to the shift to streaming. The company reached a milestone with global streaming subscribers reaching nearly 30 million across its streaming platforms which include CBS All Access, Showtime OTT and BET Plus\*\*. Domestic streaming subscribers was up 71% to 19.2 million YoY.\*\*

Meanwhile, Pluto TV – which Viacom acquired in early 2019 for $340 million – clinched 43 million global monthly active users and 30.1 million domestic MAUs. **Pluto TV also closed new global distribution agreements with Samsung and Google.**

**Global streaming and digital video revenue increased 71% year-over-year to $888 million in Q4, driven by 74% growth in streaming subscription revenue and 69% streaming advertising revenue growth.**

**Total revenue increased 3% YoY to $6.8 billion in Q4 and the company took in $1.08 billion in operating income. Advertising revenue increased 4% YoY to $3.1 billion in the quarter, mainly due to the growth of streaming and political advertising in Q4.**

Chief Financial Officer Naveen Chopra said ViacomCBS ended 2020 with $2.6 billion in global streaming subscription and advertising revenue – **with an annual run rate of $3.6 billion – exceeding the company’s expectations.** He added that ViacomCBS has a goal of reaching 65 million to 75 million global streaming subscribers – mainly through Paramount Plus – and more than $7 billion in streaming revenue by 2024.

**The new service includes more than 30,000 TV episodes and films such as “The Godfather” and “The Brady Bunch” as well as content from CBS, BET, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, MTV and the Smithsonian Channel.**

**Paramount Plus will also debut original movies, series and documentaries, and ViacomCBS is investing aggressively in content to support the growth of its streaming services. ViacomCBS invested $15 billion on content last year, and streaming content expenses will increase to at least $5 billion by 2024**.

“We came up with the pricing strategy because we wanted to serve the greatest addressable audience – which we thing the two tiers does,” said Tom Ryan, president and CEO of streaming at ViacomCBS, who also co-founded Pluto TV. “Also, the two-tiers allow us to drive both subscription and advertising revenue. The $4.99 tier gives us greater flexibility in how we go to market with distribution partners.”

That lower tier still has a lot more content than CBS All Access had. The $9.99 plan has no ads and also has more live sports – including NFL football, the UEFA Champions League, PGA Tour and more – and breaking news, **both of which the execs said is rare in streaming.**

“Right now, we think those are the best price points to go to market with and they’re clearly very competitive in each of their respective lanes,” Ryan said.

Unlike HBO Max, which announced in December that it would release its slate of films simultaneously in theaters and streaming, ViacomCBS said it is committed to the theatrical experience, though the typical 90-day window before a theatrical release is available to buy or rent will be much shorter. **Major films such as “A Quiet Place Part 2” and “Mission Impossible 7” will be available on Paramount Plus 45 days after hitting theaters.**

The company also remains committed to free ad-supported TV. **Pluto TV is on its way to becoming a billion-dollar business and is the top free ad-supported streaming service in the United States with the largest distribution footprint in AVOD.** By the end of 2024, Pluto TV is expected to have between 100 million and 120 million monthly active users globally.

“Pluto TV hasn’t just proven our skeptics wrong, we pioneered a new category and now we’re one of the free leading television services,” Ryan said. “Our ad partners love Pluto because we offer the best of both worlds – the efficient targeting of digital with the brand building and storytelling of traditional TV.”

Pluto TV helps create a “super funnel” that expands the company’s paid services, Ryan said, in part by featuring pilot episodes or past seasons of a show before a new season airs.

**“Once they’re hooked, we offer a trial subscription for more,” he said. “With Pluto’s free linear experience, we can effortlessly introduce tens of millions of viewers to the amazing content we’ve highlighted.”**

**We see several potential catalysts over the coming weeks and months for VIAC:**

**Paramount+ launch:** After a robust marketing campaign with advertisements on the Super Bowl, The Grammy Awards and NCAA March Madness, we expect Paramount+ to have meaningfully broadened consumer awareness. As a result, we expect strong SVOD subscriber net adds in 1Q21. On a total reported basis (i.e., including Showtime OTT and other DTC services), we estimate VIAC will add 4mn+ global SVOD subscribers in 1Q21 vs. an implied average of 2-3mn per quarter during 2020.

**June pricing change:** In early June, VIAC will debut a $4.99 pricing tier for Paramount+, which will also remove the linear station feeds from the service. At this point, management has indicated they will be able to explore further bundling and distribution agreements, which we view as a potential catalyst to 2021 subscriber growth.

**Improving original content slate:** As production returns across VIAC's studios, we expect the original content slate for both film and television to improve for the company's DTC services, namely Paramount+, and the company's linear networks.

**Improving advertising trends:** As the economy reopens, we believe demand for advertising will continue to recover. With the expanded reach from Pluto TV and Paramount+, we believe VIAC presents advertisers a more holistic offering and the ability to reach all age demos.

**We maintain our Buy rating and 12-month price target of $75 for VIAC.**

Note also that Paramount+ only launched in the quarter on March 3, and has the below % share of new subscribers, **beating Disney+, Hulu and Netflix.**

Also, according to this [article](https://investorplace.com/2021/04/viac-stock-worth-21-percent-more-using-free-cash-flow/) by InvestorPlace:

“Last year, ViacomCBS made $1.891 billion in free cash flow (FCF), according to the company’s earnings release. However, that included a large negative FCF result of -$453 million for Q4 2020. That implies that the FCF for the first 9 months of 2020 was $2.344 billion.

This is why I believe that the Q1 2021 results will show a huge turnaround in FCF. The same thing happened last year.

Back in Q1 2020, FCF was $305 million, a turnaround from Q4 2019 when it was at -$629 million. Fiscal year 2019 ended up with a positive FCF of $826 million, despite the hit during the fourth quarter.

So, this must be a seasonal thing about negative FCF during Q4. In fact, looking at the numbers for Q4 2020 even more closely, it included a total of $388 million in one-time losses on sales of assets. That would have come close to covering most of the -$453 million in FCF during Q4 2020. **This is another reason why I believe that Q1 will show a major turnaround in free cash flow**.”

**Recent Price Targets for VIAC:** Benchmark Firm gives $120, Citi gives $92, Needham gives $80, Goldman Sachs gives $75, BMO Capital gives $70

**My 100K position (all in):**

**TL;DR: VIAC is severely undervalued and could present a fantastic turn around play for 2021. Buy LEAPS or shares.**

&#x200B;

Not financial or investment advice. Just my opinion. I eat crayons for breakfast. Yada, yada, yada..

2021-05-03 17:36:21,wallstreetbets,"Some thoughts on Pluto TV and why it's a game changer.  After reading this DD, I went to Pluto TV.  Literally, just searched Pluto TV, hit the link and was immediately watching ""The Soloist"" on my screen.  There was a guide at the bottom to scroll through for other programs.  The Soloist is just what popped up first.

Here's the thing.  I run a Linux based operating system (Ubuntu) as my main media purposed machine as well as another named ArchLinux for personal computing.  And anybody that runs these platforms for media knows the headaches many content providers create by trying to protect their content via DRM (Digital Rights Management).  So, while, the content may be streamed from a Linux server (looking at you Amazon), the ability to watch the content on a Linux based machine can be problematic if the proper DRM decoding isn't happening on the receiving machine.

Disney+ screwed this up pretty bad when advertising their service as being available on all devices and Linux users immediately signing up, giving Disney their money and finding out that their machines didn't qualify as ""all devices"".  This was corrected by Disney to their credit, but it did take a few weeks to work it out.

This is important to note because the average consumer doesn't have the knowledge or ability to work through a DRM issue with their device when their device somehow ends up non-compliant.  This has happened with Bluray playback devices, Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu.  Pretty much all of them.

The industry standard answer has always been to go buy a new compliant device or, in the case of Bluray, to hook up your device to the internet and download new firmware.  Given your playback device had the capability.  If not, you were fucked.

Again, this is all in a response to what the OP is talking about in the pirating industry.  The content creators are trying to protect their IP (Intellectual Property), and they have a right to do so.  But in the past, mostly it was protected via advertising.  The money these channels made was never from the consumer, but rather the advertiser.  Redistribution of free content has never really been a problem.

Never really been a problem that is, until recently, when that content was making it's way into streaming services that were fee based.  Want to watch ""The Office"", no problem, every past season is on Netflix and even though at release it was free to watch on NBC via an old school antenna, now it costs you money.  Then on top of that fee, you need to jump through the hoops Netflix puts in place to ensure the content is protected from piracy.  But, yay, no commercials.  So, you've got that.

This is all to say that streaming services are still a very new thing in how we consume media. And many streaming services are struggling to maintain their fee based structure, while ALSO protecting their content from piracy (Come on, EVERYBODY has seen Game of Thrones.  There aren't that many people with HBO subscriptions.)

So, we have multiple problems in the streaming industry.  And the bulk of consumers have no idea how to navigate those problems, or even that those problems exist.  What they want to do is plug in their device hit a button and start watching TV.

So, when I say that I just opened my browser on a traditionally non-compliant device (Though I have DRM enabled through Chrome), and was able to immediately start watching TV.  No registration, no username, or more importantly password that I need to remember for my mother-in-law because she'll forget it.  Nothing.  Just log in and start streaming live TV.

Fuck, it doesn't even need to be good TV.  It just needs to be TV, and some shit people are familiar with or somewhat recognize.

This model is a game changer and it'll be interesting to see if it's sustainable as all revenue is going to come through advertising.  But, it's accessible in an industry that is making a lot of people feel really dumb when trying to find a way to watch The Andy Griffith Show.  Something they just got for free in the 1960's with little hassle has become so complicated that many consumers are incredibly frustrated and struggling with how all this technology has made things better and more accessible.

So, I'm in.  I'll be buying some VIAC tomorrow.

I tested Pluto TV on 4 different browsers.  Chrome, Chromium, Firefox and Opera.  The only one I had an issue with was Opera, but I have that running through a VPN and other customizations.

This is a big deal.  Don't know if it'll make money in the streaming space.  But its simplicity is needed in a world of growing complexity when it comes to media consumption."

However, it's missing one crucial component:

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're right; it only matters what the market sentiment is.  To quote...well...myself, from earlier today:  It doesn't matter that I think it's undervalued.  It doesn't matter that it is undervalued.  What matters is it's not going up.  If the mutual funds and IB's won't buy it, it doesn't go anywhere.  And right now, for whatever reason, nobody on the inside will touch it, which is why it keeps fading.

&#x200B;

I had some July calls that dropped.  So I doubled and averaged down.  And it dropped.  So I doubled THAT and averaged down....I did this NINE times, turning what was a small surefire win position given how light I walked into the trade... into a moderate level loss.  In that entire time, there was a window of about 20 minutes I could have gotten out from under the trade even, but I was in a meeting.  Finally I just acknowledged that my conviction where the price should be wasn't going to c hange that it wasn't going to get there and I took my L.

&#x200B;

2021-05-02 21:57:22,wallstreetbets,The real problem is it's a TV service in a world where no one is watching TV. If television died today we could just put sports on hulu or netflix or amazon or apple etc and nobody would notice at all. The streaming market is saturated anyone remember quibi? You can give me all the PE xyz they used to be worth whatever but they are going to shrivel and die imo. Maybe they will spike a couple times before they die but people aren't watching TV

2021-05-02 21:41:46,wallstreetbets,"The P/E is certainly interesting in this market. Dividend yield is low, but still high for this market.

Problem is the book value is quite pitiful at $3.78 and it's trading at almost a whopping 11x that. So, to reference your margin of safety, it's actually not a big margin.

Also, and this may be just me, but there's something very uncomfortable about a company buying back their stock to drive the price higher then doing an offer once it is higher. That's sketchy as hell. 

I would consider calls on this, definitely would not take a long position. As for the earnings report this week, don't bet on it. Unless they double what is expected, it will likely go down anyway. Look what happened to WY (although it recovered almost entirely quite quickly)."
2021-05-03 01:09:31,wallstreetbets,"ViacomCBS has one of the most poorly run and executed technical teams in media. Their success in launching and maintaining their streaming services feels like pure luck. They’re still struggling, even after starting a massive overhaul of the apps and internal structure to get rid of the redundancies before the merger with CBS. They don’t attract quality talent on any of the worker and middle management levels because they’re widely known for being morons and generally unpleasant to work with. Tenure is very long in many divisions (5-20+ years) creating complacency and attributing to a slower release cycle. 

They could be great. They’ve invested heavily on streaming exclusives for Star Trek that are very well done and have attracted many subscribers for those shows alone. But like many large old media companies I think that they can’t move fast enough to pivot from being “that channel grandma watches” to “must have streaming service.” If they had a massive gutting of their tech team and consolidated their other profitable platforms like Noggin into their primary platforms (massively cutting costs while at the same time attracting more long term subscribers) then they could be seen as an alternative or good edition to Disney+"
2021-05-03 02:18:47,wallstreetbets,"Sorry if this was in the DD, I kinda skipped around reading it.

Do you think with summer and covid restrictions being around the corner, profits will decline in the coming months?  I’m not sure how to use steaming stats from 2020, they did show great growth last year.. but are those people going to stay?

I’d also think they’ll get a decent bump in the fall when football comes bask.  I was unaware until today (never researched it though) that you could watch football from a steaming app.  That’s pretty much the only reason I still have cable.  I’d imagine they’d get a decent bump from it.  

How long is too long for a call?  I’m thinking I’d like to go past q3 earnings at least, maybe to q4 to reflect the full nfl bump.

Any thoughts?"

Cord cutting is much more likely to outpace growth in subscriptions according to Ark and others. Also, I've never heard of any of AwesomenessTV or even PlutoTV. Granted, I don't live in the US, but this seems more like a defensive name/trade than a growth story even if Paramount+ does well...

Seems like it could be primed for a small short squeeze on good news, but I'm bearish on 1-2 year growth prospects overall."
2021-05-03 04:23:50,wallstreetbets,"The streaming business is overrated from an investment standpoint. Market is massively saturated right now, I can't see any service making substantial profits due to how low prices are and user growth is low for Viacom (No, 11% user growth is not impressive when you start from such a low bar). Also they'll make way more money from the box office for AQP2 + MI7 than it being added to the streaming platform if things open up.

Viacom are not innovators - They see what everyone else does and copies them. Yes, you're buying a ""cheap"" stock, but it's not something I can see having any real income growth."

2021-05-03 09:47:29,wallstreetbets,"Counterpoint to all the stuff you said about VIAC, Paramount hiring the guy that greenlit the most recent X-Men movies doesn’t bode well (seriously, watch Dark Phoenix and New Mutants), Paramount’s streaming service isn’t worth $1 a month, and they can’t monetize Nickelodeon nearly as well as Disney has monetized its vast library because they only have a few programs that kids *prefer* (Spongebob and Paw Patrol, that’s it in my house). Yes, they have other stuff, but it’s not more appealing than Disney’s or PBS’s stuff, and a lot of Nick’s streaming is free anyway because they get money from the government for kids programming under special conditions. Paramount has one good property, Star Trek, and while Picard gets at least middling reviews, Discovery is unwatchable (and yes I am a nerd, that’s the point).

TL;DR  Even in the absolutely bonkers market we’re in, this stock has small $$ written on it. Also, I didn’t see nearly enough counter argument in your DD, which makes this feel like a timeshare pitch. I hope you do well from your $100k investment but I will not be sticking my dick in that."

2021-05-03 06:45:10,wallstreetbets,"Ok i went through it and realized that you're talking about a streaming service. Bruh, there  really are only few things i don't invest in:

1. industries that i wish would die (e.g. tabacco, oil)

2. Nestle 

3. This is new, you just made me realize - digital companies that offer paid services which anyone can get for free by just downloading them elsewhere. Hear me out - i get it, everyone loves netflix, spotify and whatnot, but the rate at which these subscription services are growing nowadays only makes me think that there will be a point where (for one reason or another) people will immediately stop using them and they will go to shit. I don't care for the ""upcoming market correction"" that's been promised for the last few years, i still keep on investing and being a bull, BUT all these subscription service companies that offer services we already can get for free - naaaah man, i ain't about that retard life.

Based on the company fundamentals I calculate an intrinsic value in the range of  $25-$33 per share given the large amount of debt, lack of growth & high level of competition - also it would be handy to see the viewer market share % going back several years to see if VIAC is maintaining, growing or losing its viewing figures especially in relation to its streaming venture and how that compares to market share of its streaming competitors"

2021-05-03 08:41:20,wallstreetbets,This is the way. VIAC 🚀
2021-05-03 03:51:50,wallstreetbets,"I agree. But market sentiment is a risk that cannot be quantitatively factored in. If the market were to suddenly drop, every stock will likely fall, no matter how good the business is or how strong the fundamentals are. That is a risk you inherently take when opening any new position. And that is why, with VIAC, I recommend going with leaps that are not too OTM or just shares. Gives you nice risk/reward and also allows for some wiggle room. 

Also, in a market where everything seems to be highly overvalued, I'd rather enter a trade that is fundamentally strong instead of the garbage WSB has been going after lately (e.g. MVIS). VIAC has solid foundations and the business is not dying. They have the rights to stream NFL and UEFA Champions League. No other streaming service can provide sports coverage in a way VIAC does. Thats a huge advantage when trying to gain market share during the so called ""streaming wars"". If they can pivot successfully (admittedly they had a late start, but I believe they will), the stock price is only going up from here. 

Thanks for poking holes in the DD. Always appreciated. Love all your DDs too."

2021-05-02 21:03:24,wallstreetbets,"u/Darkbyte, it's a valid point to say that the $100+ price was due to the Hwangster at Archegos, but the counter to your counter is that this company is trading at a 10x P/E, it's profitable, and it's paying a 2% dividend when its shitty ass competitor, FOX, is trading at a 15 P/E WITHOUT a streaming offering comparable to Paramount +.  Don't forget, Viacom also owns Showtime, PlutoTV (the most underappreciated free streaming service), and is rapidly expanding overseas (they recently acquired Chilevision as well).

I agree, that currently and in the short term, $100 is a stretch, but the FMV just based off of its weakest competitor (FOX) puts it at $65+."
2021-05-02 20:56:21,wallstreetbets,Sure. But that nothing to do with the business or fundamentals. Read the DD.

empty airport seats love watching tv"
2021-05-02 22:07:58,wallstreetbets,"Sure but they're in a WIN-WIN situation here.

If you're right, then people cord cut faster and their streaming TV services such as  Paramount + (which includes CBS and the NFL), PlutoTV (which is a competitor to HULU and it's totally free and doesn't even need a login), Showtime, Nickelodian, MTV, Smithsonian, etc etc succeed further.

If you're wrong, then their legacy portfolio wins (nationwide CBS networks, syndication of all of their channels like MTV on Cable TV networks)."
2021-05-03 02:56:36,wallstreetbets,Can’t they just sell the shows they produce then?
2021-05-02 22:37:15,wallstreetbets,Which is why they are streaming. Did you watch walking dead on Amazon's AMC+ channel?

2021-05-03 00:11:19,wallstreetbets,"I would argue you see the same for most stocks since the March 2020 crash. Almost all stocks have seen hyperinflation since then. For VIAC and others there was a unique partially closed system event that erased the run since then. The rest of the market is still experiencing that euphoric rise.

Assuming eventual market wide downturn:

The bearish outlook is that VIAC will tank twice when the euphoria evaporates and the market turns over.

The bullish outlook is that it's now more of a value stock than a growth, and is therefore a safer investment should the market take a downturn. Value stocks are a safe haven during a crash.

  


OTOH, assuming the market will continue growing like it has over the past decade for the foreseeable future:

Bullish take, VIAC is holding at 2019 support and given the previous growth stock PE, could move in that direction again.

Bearish take, there's enough uncertainty around VIAC that until it breaks out of the current horizontal channel, investment in the market is going to yield better returns and is a safer investment."

2021-05-03 09:53:01,wallstreetbets," They got GME to $500 (100 folds) and AMC to $20 and if APES sold, then Market Manipulators would have survived and loved it to pay the 100 folds. However, Market Manipulators are afraid it would go in the thousands. So $100 for AMC ir $400 for GME is probably on normal times not when it is heavily shorted and especially probably billions in synthetic shares. They flooded the market and therefore, the price could go infinite and they teach that as a risk to shortening. They should also teach the risk to synthetic shortening. Apes are smart to recognize the bashers and the manipulation as a sign of Market Manipulation desperation and Apes would buy more and hold tighter."

2021-05-03 12:38:00,wallstreetbets,no you ain’t 🚀
2021-05-03 07:48:29,wallstreetbets,"I value Pluto above anything else CBS has streaming wise.  Yeah they got NFL games but the same exact ones you can get over the air in your market for free.  The Champions League is NHL tier in the states theres growth to be had there but the only thing that is going to put Soccer in the US mainstream is the US National team actually doing something at consecutive world cups.  Paramount Plus is way down the line on the streaming wars.  They arent catching Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, HBO max or Disney plus no matter how much Star Trek nostalgia and Chuck Lorre spinoffs they throw on there.  

But Pluto is interesting.  I've perused it on Roku and for an entirely free option its got enormous growth potential the question is can it beat out Peacock or IMDB for the free streaming war.  Peacock has all the NBC shows plus the WWE on it.  IMDB has a ton of great movies and shows.  Pluto has a strange assortment of either far left or far right news sources 24 hour channels of niche shows and what can only be described as channels 100-200 on old digital cable lineups.

Tbh short term in bullish on viacom to a degree which ought to favor your gamble on it but long term I'm not so rosy on Viacom at all.  There streaming service for the monthly cost in an already saturated market is subpar compared to competitors.  They seemed to have developed it as an afterthought since it was CBS all access then they decided years too late you know we should probably put the entire CBS and Paramount catalog on one service.  If they had done that in 2014 or something and not 2020 they would be in a better position.  This also doesnt even touch upon how balls to the wall disney is going on ESPN by putting the Super Bowl on ESPN along with ABC."

2021-05-02 22:55:17,wallstreetbets,Did you miss my point about streaming services being over saturated and some of them needing to fail ? 👀
2021-05-03 00:29:35,wallstreetbets,"Thank you! And...do these move independently of each other? Or, better question, should I be buying VIAC and not VIACA?"
2021-05-03 05:46:37,wallstreetbets,Exactly 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-03 18:55:34,wallstreetbets,"Well. You're talking to a non-intellectual, thats why I'm on this sub. Idk what you expect me to say"
2021-05-02 21:55:00,wallstreetbets,"Well, no. Companies do buy backs to reduce their liabilities. If companies were freely allowed to manipulate their stock in that way, they could pull all kinds of accounting fuckery (which they do already) to have a shit quarter, drop the price, buy back shares, push the good stuff onto the next quarter, overperform by a huge margin, stock shoots up, then public offering.

Also, I didn't say the P/E is a whopping 11x. 11 for P/E is actually great and I believe it's just under 11 in this case. I said the stock, at $41, is trading at almost 11x its book value."
2021-05-03 00:22:22,wallstreetbets,My take is its gonna be pretty flat. Staying between 40 and 50 for a LONG time. Dumb to think its gonna get back up to the 60s let alone above that
2021-05-02 23:44:40,wallstreetbets,That doesnt make any sense idiot

2021-05-03 16:11:59,wallstreetbets,"The guys DD aside, Paramount+ just isn't worth $1 a month. Something like a quarter to .30 cents/mo would be fair."

2021-05-03 12:28:35,wallstreetbets,"Don't be fooled. This thing is HIGHLY speculative. I got in around mid 30's and wrote a 45 covered call when it crossed 40. Got hit on the call and then was kicking myself when it ran. Bought back in at 39 something not long ago. 

The problems with VIAC are many. First, their streaming platform is trash. I just don't see it being as sticky as HBOMax or D+. Second, their legacy business that drives cash flow is in the absolute toilet. That business is 100% tied to OTA and cable. T just reported losing 620k cable subs in Q1. Those sorts of losses are going to shred VIAC's legacy business because ad rates and carriage fees are going to continue to evaporate. Of course, a few good quarters of flashy growth numbers on streaming and the market will forget how big of a turd the legacy business is. 

My investment thesis on this is it has to be attractive as an M&A play or else I'm not interested. Right now it's still a bit rich to be an M&A target, but it's not totally out of the realm of possibility. There is so much cash out there someone might take a gamble on it. The content portfolio is really big and someone has to want it. 

It's definitely speculative as hell because of how bad the underlying business is."
2021-05-03 17:39:04,wallstreetbets,And then watched 10% go away???

There netflix is the streamer of choice, but they don't have the same affinity with Disney titles, but Netflix doesn't have what the EU/UK really really wants, futbol.  Look for Paramount+ to be a disruptor in the streaming game wherever the beautiful game is beloved."

I don't think Discovery has a place in the world you're talking about on its own, but it is generating content that people want to watch and will be a good portfolio asset under Viacom or Disney/Comcast."
2021-05-03 04:36:21,wallstreetbets,"Live tv , especially sports makes this very dynamic.i personally have P+. NFL is coming up. 4.99 to watch live football 18 + weeks is worth it alone. I agree with your statement, but don't think Viac is going to fail."
2021-05-03 02:34:03,wallstreetbets,They're very dependent on each other. Think of it this way. VIACA is just VIAC + the value of the voting rights.
2021-05-03 00:39:03,wallstreetbets,They tend to trend together with a premium on viaca. Viaca volume is way lower than viac. Wish I could tell you why 🤷‍♂️

2021-05-03 18:02:20,wallstreetbets,"Here's what I just did.  I just went to Pluto TV, and was immediately watching a live stream of TV with a simple guide at the bottom of the screen to scroll through.  This was on a Linux based machine that traditionally has to jump through hoops to get content enabled on it from the premium services (I can't stream HBO Max).

So, while you're correct that Disney+ and HBO Max are much more elegant and present a more aesthetically pleasing frontend for their content, I'll challenge you to a race.  

Let's find one random 75 year old person.  We're going to sit them down in front of a laptop.  And each of us gets a turn.  We'll be timed in how quickly we can have that 75 year old watching TV.  I get Pluto TV and you get Disney+ or HBO Max.  

Oh, also, you lose if the 75 year old ever asks you for the password you set up for them.  

My point is that Pluto TV is not trying to compete with Disney+.  They're trying to compete in a space that has become so complicated for so many consumers by creating a product that is accessible with just the touch of a button.  No usernames, passwords, etc.  

So, my argument is that the product is good and fills a need.  Which is what we really want when investing in a company's product.  

I agree, still speculative that this model is profitable enough to sustain a share price in the 40's, much less any higher than that. 

But the product isn't trash.  It's a needed product in an overly complex and invasive industry."

2021-05-03 18:29:14,wallstreetbets,"Pluto is a nice product. I should have clarified. I meant Paramount+ is trash and to me that is a big chunk of the future cash flow necessary to drive the stock price up. I know there will be some ad revenue off Pluto, but the real pot of gold for the streaming companies is the annuity of having a legit paid streaming service that is on par with Netflix and Paramount+ is not there yet. It is light year's behind HBOMax and D+ in terms of content. I think VIAC has a lot of out licenses that will be coming back in a few years, but right now I just don't see the pot of gold in that product. 

VIAC makes a massive chunk of change off carriage fees and Paramount+ is necessary to replace those."
2021-05-03 18:44:55,wallstreetbets,"Pluto makes sense, basic Youtube is free and look at the cash it generates.  Eyeballs = $$$.  Better folks are watching Pluto than going to a competitor.

First and foremost, ViacomCBS is a content giant, and while it’s market cap is a fraction of Netlfix and Disney, it punches above it’s weight in this category.  Streaming tech is proprietary, and cloud providers like AWS even the playing field.

Viacom is relevant in Pay TV because of content, and that same content is in great demand, and will be in streaming form.  The one ace up the sleeve is live sports and news.  If Viacom executes on this as they’ve outlined, it will bring in big subs and big ad dollars."

2021-05-03 02:20:43,wallstreetbets,"If you can believe that GME can turn itself around despite being a ""dying retailer"" than the possibility of VIAC's transition into streaming services providing additional value, especially when tied to its assets which provide differentiation and advantage should be believable. These streaming assets add value. Also you might have missed the stock offering which they did causing this whole crash. This has added value. Stocks in general have been trading at crazy valuations as the devaluation of the dollar continues. VIAC has a mixed potential offering both value and potential for growth. This adds value relative to the rest of the market. Even if VIAC sits at 1:1 actualized growth with 2019 it's growth potential has massively increased. Fox is trading at 1:1 with its 2019 price rn and is in a garbage position relative to VIAC. Take more into consideration than just ""haha cable TV stinky""."

The only channel they have that makes any kind of money at all is MTV cause all of their shitty programming costs nothing to make. It had its crazy valuation already and plummeted back to normal levels. Which had NOTHING to do with their stock offering. It droped from 90 to 40 dude.

2021-05-03 02:46:25,wallstreetbets,"I mean if you're going to just ignore all the reasons laid out in front of you in the post above why it should be valued more compared to 2019, ignore the Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research price target of $75 released after the crash, ignore the fact that yes, it was the stock offering that caused the drop in valuation as that's the event that triggered Hwang's liquidation and block selling, ignore the fact that their streaming service offers news and sports which although it doesn't guarantee success, already differentiates it from Netflix and Disney+ , ignore the fact that the streaming service now actually exists when it didn't before, then yeah sure NOTHING has changed since 2019. There's never any guarantees in the market but his argument is well reasoned and laid out, with expert backing (Goldman) and supporting facts. I don't know if I agree with the high price targets in the $75-100 but to say the stock isn't undervalued at current prices ($41, equal to its December 2019 share price) has to ignore absolutely ALL of that and sounds more like making excuses than the bull case."

2021-05-03 09:00:39,wallstreetbets,Sure.  Anyhow after looking at that list if DAZN ever goes public that would be a good buy I had no idea how vast their footprint was in European Soccer.  Fuck like they got the rights in Germany?
2021-05-03 12:36:59,wallstreetbets,"No idea tbh because I have not even looked at VXRT. But from what I have skimmed, I would be careful with any company that works in developing a product or vaccine. For example, CRMD is developing a ground breaking drug that would have complete market dominance in the Catheter market and it would of been the basic standard of care over time. However, FDA sent a CRL on March 1st because of the third part manufacturer and it tanked the stock. The drug is still insane and FDA has no issues but because of a third party manufacturer, the timing and development of the drug is in limbo. When I looked at MVIS, I looked at it's history as a company, it's balance sheet, it's competitors as well and I thought a lot of the hype around the stonk was grossly misleading. My only advice is that sometimes no matter how great a product is that stock can always tank hard, especially when it is in development or trying to get approval. You need a series of perfect outcomes in order to succeed, one bump in the road and the whole stock goes crumbling and it takes a while to recover from the speedbump (refer to CRMD lmao). Anyway, good luck."

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 3 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! This week isn't as spicy as the last, but there's still buckets of money to be made regardless.

&nbsp;

I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum-byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum-byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- First and foremost, **expect extra volatility this week**. Many of the companies who report this week are *young*, and as a result tend to swing heavily after earnings as the market tries to price in their ""true"" values. Expect some big swings coming out of the newer companies.

- **Be wary of solar plays**. Enphase got fucking *rocked* last week due to semiconductor shortages plaguing the sector, so such price action may be seen across the other solar stocks as well. That being said, following Enphases drop, many other solar stocks had sympathy drops, so these shortages may be priced in. Regardless, unless you've got some insider news, look to avoid them for now.

- This is kind of a no brainer, but **NKLA puts will print**. First and foremost, the company is a fraud. Second of all, following of ALL of it's earnings reports, NKLA has gone down every single time bar one, where it went up **0%**. You read that right. 0% was the most NKLA has risen following earnings. Sell credit spreads or buy puts. I've got no faith in Trevor Milton.

- **PENN Reports the day before Draftkings**. They usually follow very similar price movement, so you can use this to your advantage. If PENN puts up good numbers and goes up, you can almost guarentee that DKNG will do the same thing the following day when it reports.

- **Beyond Meat MOVES**. Similar to Enphase last week, BYND almost always craters or rockets following an earnings report. Personally, I would avoid this ticker, but the adrenaline junkies are more than welcome to run long strangles if they're within their personal risk tolerance. There's an awesome amount of money to be made here.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 60 fuckin’ companies, theres plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We’ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there’s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum-byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season!

So if the company reports in the AM, it's close of that same day. 

If the company reports in the PM, it's the close of the next trading day.

Is that correct?"

Everyone knows they are a fraud, but if they pull something out of thin air that dosnt make the stock tank, rip puts.

2021-05-03 15:51:54,wallstreetbets,what are you talking about? Solid shot into the 30s short term? because of earnings? The last time it hit the 30s was in the march squeeze and that squeeze happened because it was heavily shorted and hediges were covering. You realize that it's less than 8% shorted right now? I highly highly doubt it will push anywhere close to thirty because of earnings in the short term. We'll see.
2021-05-03 05:39:50,wallstreetbets,"No company moves earnings up early for bad news, this 🤡☝️"
2021-05-03 05:43:18,wallstreetbets,Price will probably go down more lol
2021-05-02 22:48:14,wallstreetbets,"I think what happens Monday and Tuesday will dictate the short term on MVIS but a lot of new faces/baggers that likely won't sell because the short term pain. The true short term pain or long term potential is after the shareholders meeting end of May.

2021-05-03 11:25:20,wallstreetbets,"Amid a bad earnings report, I was holding out hope CEO Sumit Sharma would offer a explanation and corrective action to stop the bleeding. However all he could offer was an expectation for product release in late 3rd or 4th quarter.

Based on that I sold this morning @ 14.25 today for a disastrous loss, 'OUCH'."
2021-05-03 13:19:33,wallstreetbets,The low 20's had super low premium a few weeks ago when RKT kept going lower. It eventually went into the high 20 dollar range and were dirt cheap contracts. Bought late may for an earnings play and for extra wiggle room. I think my average is 1.80 a pop.

2021-05-03 16:19:35,wallstreetbets,Yeah shorts are at 8% but to my knowledge many institutions are expecting the housing bubble to pop in the next couple months. You think potential shorters don’t want to see it spike to 40-60 so they can open new short positions at that price and send it all back down to earth?
2021-05-03 10:59:01,wallstreetbets,MVIS has entered the chat lol
2021-05-03 01:06:32,wallstreetbets,Idk it held super steady all Friday and closed with a little uptrend. I think a lot of people see good value in the buyout combined with a genuine product and leadership that delivers on their promises consistently.

2021-05-03 04:33:53,wallstreetbets,$36.5. You?
2021-05-03 03:15:45,wallstreetbets,Are you retarded or what? Strangle is a bet that it'll move big in either direction and a put credit spread is a neutral to bullish play. It's a 2:1 bullish:bearish ratio so OP is mostly bullish.
2021-05-02 22:59:54,wallstreetbets,I don't like your vibes

2021-05-03 16:45:53,wallstreetbets,"If any of that were true, and that's in the are about the housing bubble and your theory they would let it run up. That is more of a longer term thing. Anyone buying weekly or biweekly options on this is going to get burned because there is just not enough interest over all in RKT for a long time now to move it that hard on its own. The reason it shot up last march was a short squeeze. It shot up all the way to 40. It had over 60% SI or some shit, lol. That's why it was able to run up that high in one day. A run up that big is not going to happen this time around imo. Ya'll will be lucky if it breaks $26 or $27. Longer term, yeah it could def start to climb. I'm talking only very short term here. People buying OTM weeklies and or biweeklies are prob going to get burned if they get them too far out of the money."

2021-05-03 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NVAX to the moon 🌙🌙🌙🚀🚀🚀 Shared by an educated investor - reshaping since the content is so good. 

1) Highest efficacy against the original Covid-19 strain (~96%)
- Pfizer: 95%
- Moderna: 94%
- J&J: 72%
- AstraZeneca: 62%
- CanSino: 65%
- Sinopharm: 79%
- Sinovac: 50%
- Sputnik: 91% (questionable)
2) Highest efficacy against the South Africa variant (~60%)
- Novavax: 60%
- J&J: 57%
- AstraZeneca: 10%
- others: horrible
3) The only vaccine with proven efficacy against 3 variants, including the UK variant (86%)
- Novavax’s technology shows excellent cross-protection against drifted strains and mutations
- this aspect of Novavax's technology was recently proven /w its Flu vaccine ...handily beating the market leader: Fluzone
4) Highest single-dose efficacy (83.4%)
5) Highest levels of Antibodies: 600% higher than the next-best vaccine!
- the Novavax vaccine probably will last for about 5 months longer than the next best vaccine
6) The only major Covid vaccine that can easily be made into a multivalent vaccine that contains multiple variants (3-5) in a single dose
- 60-80% less antigen than RNA vaccines
- NanoFlu already has 4 strains of the flu in its dose 
- This may prove to be the most important factor for determining which vaccine is best
- This is the future; Others can't do this
7) Novavax has the highest manufacturing capacity ...slated to be about
- 2B by middle of 2021
- 2.7B by end of 2021
- 3B by early 2022
8) Novavax has ""lowest cost per dose"" (Bill Gates)
9) Novavax has simplicity of manufacturing
- ""the composition of the Novavax makes it arguably the simplest yet to manufacture"" (Al Edwards)
10) Novavax has the most geographically-diversified production
- US, EU, UK, Japan, South Korea, India, and Canada
11) Novavax has the highest quality group of partners
- Not just first place, Novavax ""has taken partnerships to a whole other level""
12) Beats all other manufacturers /w easiest distribution and storage requirements
- 36°F to 46°F ...normal refrigeration
- stores for up to 6 months
13) Best tolerability (% issues)
- Novavax: 40%
- Pfizer: 91%
- Moderna: 90%
- others: less than Novavax
14) Longest durability of protection
15) Developed w/o the use of fetal cell lines (this will become an issue once there is ""choice"" of vaccines)
16) Novavax is very undervalued with tremendous high upside, making it a strong buy.
17) Novavax continues to be largely off the radar for the general public
18) The mainstream media (including most of the financial media) and the market have not yet started to pay attention
19) Analyst Josh Schimmer (Evercore ISI), believes Novavax is the “vaccine to beat”
20) Analysts at B. Riley (Mayank Mamtani) and JP Morgan said Novavax is ""best-in-class""
21) “strong potency and unique tolerability”
22) an extremely large addressable market
23) a market cap of only ~$16B (tiny compared to all other pharma cos)
24) Biotech and pharma companies are normally valued at a price to sales multiple of between 6 and 7 times
25) suffice it to say that a short-term price target of $422 (and a gain of 230%) is being fairly conservative.
26) if the company shows signs that it will achieve its goal of a 2 billion annual capacity run-rate by mid-2021, the price target would rapidly jump higher
27) The target should also go higher as:
- its vaccine receives approvals in various major countries
- it is rolled out and becomes a far larger part of the public's consciousness
- the company should have significant pricing power by having the best vaccine
28) If it's production capacity reaches 3 billion, the rise in the share price may be astronomical.
29) This is not even counting revenues of its flu vaccine, and that it has two blockbuster RSV vaccines far along in its pipeline.
- The combined market for the RSV vaccines is over $5 billion, and there isn't even one RSV vaccine on the market!!
30) the NOVX downside a month ago was about 4 times higher than now. There is still a very large amount of upside.
31) Best risk/reward profile from an investment standpoint
32) UK EU CA NZ AU US MX IN UA ID KR PH CH JP 

These and its many other advantages
1) make it the top vaccine
2) allow Novavax to charge a premium
3) will give Novavax the largest share of the long-term market (as much as 45% of world market)

Novavax clearly gets the title of ""best Covid vaccine stock"" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2021-05-03 09:51:52,wallstreetbets,NVAX was up in pre-market and has now just shit the bed.  Was there some news that I missed?

2021-05-03 00:23:37,wallstreetbets,VAXART BOOM THIS WEEK! MARK MY WORDS...
2021-05-02 20:35:28,wallstreetbets,OCGN 🔜🚀🚀
2021-05-02 21:06:29,wallstreetbets,OCGN should be on your SA variant list. They have a preprint publication that is promising. NVAX - bulls have touted the capacity since end of 2020 and all we have seen is they push the production benchmarks further back. In Jan they said they would hit 150m/month by May. Now it’s end of Q3. There is a bottleneck in supplies for vaccine production. They still owe the US 100mil. None of the other countries are getting a vaccine from them until that’s fulfilled so you can use that as the first “catalyst”. India apparently won’t approve NVAX until it gets FDA EUA. So it’s gonna come down to when that happens. That’s prob the major catalyst. It’s clear with their rising cases they still are not willing to pull the trigger and start using it. Serum can make 1b doses but they haven’t. India is suffering from vaccine/medical supply shortage. No position.
2021-05-02 23:47:54,wallstreetbets,"I agree, but manly bc its the first covid vaccine in US that isnt based on a genetic mechanism. All vaccine hesitant and reluctant people whos jobs and school are gonna require it soon will want novavax and they will sell way more than the forecast12 shares at $215"
2021-05-03 10:52:08,wallstreetbets,I have absolutely no clue why it's tanking today. This stock is frustrating but I'm staying in.

2021-05-03 11:08:52,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been trying to trade NVAX but unfortunately I’m pulling out. 

BioNTech and Moderna are ramping production and signing huge deals everywhere, solving their issues with storage and transport, and working on multivalent. 

Meanwhile NVAX just pushed their delivery time to late 2021. Meaning they won’t make the market before the other 2 major players eat their lunch. 

Great vaccine, but company too slow. 

I’m selling all my positions at open."

2021-05-02 20:06:49,wallstreetbets,"Real world data suggests breakthrough cases by the SA variant against all currently available vaccines is still very low.

Yes, higher than other variants, but within expected tolerance for expected breakthrough. 

This is definitely not a major selling point, and my eyeballing of the hype over NVAX against the SA variant in this post really doesn't stack against what we've seen in the last several months (turbo pessimistic CNN reporting aside)."

2021-05-03 12:52:30,wallstreetbets,Doesn't OCGN just have the distribution rights to North America for Covaxin. It's not an actual substitute for Covaxin stock...
2021-05-03 10:16:54,wallstreetbets,"The JNJ and AZ vaccines are “traditional” vaccines, not using mRNA (used by Pfizer/Biontech and Moderna). I think there’s likely a niche for NVAX, but the leaders in the clubhouse are clear, so everybody else is just playing for playoff spots."
2021-05-02 20:56:17,wallstreetbets,I think you might be confusing stock price to valuation. They have the lowest market cap of any of the major vaccine producers. There are articles literally talking about how it could be classified as a value stock.
2021-05-02 20:57:16,wallstreetbets,At a minimum its much farther along then any of those companies.

2021-05-02 21:10:03,wallstreetbets,"Definetly increased efficacy but number still low unsure how much of an effect it will have  and it is developed more recent than Pfizer/modern which have little effect on this strain since it’s so new

From the data I’ve seen the JNJ and NVAX had 60% efficacy vs as low as 35-10% for pfizer/moderna without booster being developed

If NVAX is the one that can beat SA it will become invaluable but im less concerned with SA vs BR and IN because of their high R The SA strain appears to be dieing out in Belgium under wild conditions based on recent numbers and P1 B1167 still growing in % of samples Belgium predicts SA strain will run out by June and Brazilian strain will be 25% of samples 

Japan also put out numbers predicting 4th and 5th waves even larger in size than previous based on their N501Y+E848K strain effecting them
This was originally called “Japan” strain but is thought to be a 2nd or 3rd generation of P1 which has evolved and gained the UK strain mutation independently 

P3 Philippines strain is also not in the news but is also a new local spinoff of the Brazilian variant appears to have escape capabilities

2021-05-03 00:12:18,wallstreetbets,Nah man these companies are just getting started. I just jumped on at 15.09/ x2700
2021-05-03 12:45:25,wallstreetbets,"Its price is still categorized by experts as ""painful for anyone who bought in the last three months""

You didn't miss anything yet, and in fact are getting in at as good a price or better than 90% of the folks here."
2021-05-02 22:41:31,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, the GOP is starting to jump on the legalization train. It'll likely happen in the next 1-3 years. Too much money being made now. There is one thing that talks to politicians, MONEY."

2021-05-02 23:10:33,wallstreetbets,"Doesn’t matter tilray is Canadian, they do not benefit from us legalization, maybe if they want to dilute to kingdom come to buy a us mso."
2021-05-03 08:15:13,wallstreetbets,Or 29?
2021-05-03 12:25:58,wallstreetbets,Yeah it took a wrong turn and went deeper into the earth.

2021-05-03 02:21:34,wallstreetbets,Rounds you down to the nearest whole share.
2021-05-03 16:18:49,wallstreetbets,Yup. My 50 shares is now 41 and worth less. Ugh
2021-05-02 20:48:23,wallstreetbets,I think monday it will show as such
2021-05-03 00:48:32,wallstreetbets,"Today, baby. There's only one weed stock now!"
2021-05-03 10:14:52,wallstreetbets,The official date is May 5th
2021-05-02 21:03:55,wallstreetbets,wondering the same.
2021-05-03 02:23:03,wallstreetbets,I saw a DD timeline that said they need some governmental approvals but should be within 5 days.
2021-05-03 08:11:59,wallstreetbets,"https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemos?number=48654

They trade under TLRY1 and everything else is the same but if you exercise it is only worth 83 shares."
2021-05-03 02:21:47,wallstreetbets,You really should do your DD 😆. Reading is fundamental
2021-05-03 09:16:56,wallstreetbets,Got anymore money youre throwing away? Lol
2021-05-03 10:08:14,wallstreetbets,Yikes!
2021-05-03 19:25:17,wallstreetbets,This guy gets it
2021-05-03 16:03:21,wallstreetbets,Yes and it has been super confused. Looks like I made out on the merger but my account balance is way off.
2021-05-03 16:50:55,wallstreetbets,What
2021-05-03 00:25:18,wallstreetbets,"60 APHA shares * 0.83 = 49 TLRY at about 18/share. 

$910 APHA = $882 TLRY.

About."
2021-05-03 18:02:10,wallstreetbets,Doesn't matter at this point. Your APHA shares are now Tilray regardless.
2021-05-03 02:24:42,wallstreetbets,💯
2021-05-02 21:03:07,wallstreetbets,None most likely buy shares if you buy calls buy them far out
2021-05-03 08:10:32,wallstreetbets,You can’t price in a hype influx.
2021-05-03 00:45:28,wallstreetbets,You have come to the both right and wrong place
2021-05-03 10:10:44,wallstreetbets,Nothing. It’s stocks. You have X stocks. Not X shares of stock.
2021-05-02 20:49:56,wallstreetbets,"for one this merger doesn't need to be successful as long as it looks like it is and people think so, secondly the hype will continue to ride on this with positive weed political news so I think you are right to be warry however there is money to be made here again"
2021-05-02 23:52:32,wallstreetbets,"Yes legalization still in progress and these 2 great companies just mergered and acquired sweetwater.. massive growth expected, huge upside potential"
2021-05-03 10:11:14,wallstreetbets,Invest in US cannabis if you wanna go long.
2021-05-03 10:17:39,wallstreetbets,Haha this board is clueless on cannabis. The real opportunity in weed now is in the US. I’m up huge after dumping my APHA and putting it in US operators.
2021-05-02 22:34:47,wallstreetbets,But its old news....
2021-05-03 00:46:25,wallstreetbets,Human psychology is what makes the market go up or down.
2021-05-02 22:14:42,wallstreetbets,This is a new frontier. Noone knows. I see big upside potential
2021-05-03 13:07:35,wallstreetbets,"It will convert your shares of APHA to tilray if it hasn't already. It should eventually tell you what your average cost per share is, but mine hasnt loaded the price yet"
2021-05-03 17:58:05,wallstreetbets,"Look at your account. Aphria will no longer be traded, so any shares you had have now automatically been converted into Tilray shares."
2021-05-03 17:56:50,wallstreetbets,Their shares got converted into Tilray shares at a rate of 0.83 to 1 (or vise versa). I had 100 APHA shares that are now 83 TLRY.

2021-05-03 06:42:31,wallstreetbets,"I cannot comprehend this talking point. 

Are international alcohol producers shut out of the American market? They will benefit from US legalization immensely. They don’t have to buy anything. They have products to sell."

2021-05-03 16:24:21,wallstreetbets,Don’t worry about it. It’s day 1 after merger. Tilray is easily a $20+ stock based on this merger. Remember it is THE biggest cannabis company in the world.
2021-05-03 02:23:59,wallstreetbets,So already losing money?
2021-05-02 20:05:35,wallstreetbets,Lol US cannabis companies don’t trade on the NewYork Stock Exchange my guy!! Plus Tilray and aphria both own US beer companies And hemp companies. Acquiring companies is not a problem for the new tilray.
2021-05-02 20:43:35,wallstreetbets,Yea but the one thing you forgot is tilray has the European Market.  Now add US Market and what you got . Alot  of potential. Sometimes you should Ling term on situations.
2021-05-03 07:48:15,wallstreetbets,You dont think  that tirlay can't just aquire companies? They are an international powerhouse.

2021-05-03 15:55:35,wallstreetbets,"Seriously dude, every single time I see someone post about TLRY or any Canadian LPs, it seems like there is a flood of redditors posting about how ""MSOs are better"" or ""MSOs have a moat""... If my grandma, nephew, and 10yo hillbilly cousin all thinks MSOs (or anything else) is the better investment, to me, that is the definition of when something stops making money. If everyone else thinks something is a sure thing, guess what... even if it is a ""sure thing"", you won't make any money on it because success is already priced in. I realize the irony in the fact that ""everyone"" includes me, so if I think MSOs are not a sure thing, that means that not everyone thinks MSOs are a sure thing, but I'm here to tell you, that most people are not good at stocks, but as for me, I'm good at stocks."

2021-05-03 09:51:46,wallstreetbets,I mean that’s one theory but if you look at the retail market in USA are they currently buying cannabis from Canada????
2021-05-03 07:28:23,wallstreetbets,They have ownership in Sweet water and Manitoba Harvest. One with huge distribution networks and the other already sells cannabis products in the US

2021-05-03 10:14:03,wallstreetbets,They will soon! And if you get in now you’ll make a shitload more than you will Tilray. Tilray is not profitable and US companies already are. It’s a shit company that’s only done well because it’s one of the few cannabis companies you could invest in. It’s already way overpriced.

2021-05-03 16:10:51,wallstreetbets,Not sure what you're trying to say but you helped proved my point... TLRY/APHA have been the talk of the last few years but how often do you hear about Curaleaf or Trulieve? or $MSOS for that matter?
2021-05-03 05:45:27,wallstreetbets,I have 4 APHA shares now worth zero. Do these become TLRY shares worth anything or am I screwed?

2021-05-03 09:51:39,wallstreetbets,That saying itbwas 65 a while back in this context is disingenuous

2021-05-03 00:10:38,wallstreetbets,ETF homey.
2021-05-02 20:46:35,wallstreetbets,They have well over half a billion dollars in cash. Plenty of MSOs would take that.
2021-05-03 08:06:48,wallstreetbets,You get .8381 shares of TLRY for every share you have of APHA.
2021-05-03 08:06:53,wallstreetbets,I think you're probably gonna lose one share. Each APHA share should become .8381 TLRY shares and they round down so you're likely ending up with 3
2021-05-03 09:35:27,wallstreetbets,It will convert to 3 tilray shares and the excess price will be paid out to you
2021-05-02 20:50:54,wallstreetbets,how is that remotely possible? I imagine my shares will just convert when the market opens. there was nothing I saw to click to convert.
2021-05-03 03:33:48,wallstreetbets,That is correct!
2021-05-02 20:58:21,wallstreetbets,Yep plus the earnings should be tending back to normal coming out of the pandemic going into this crazy rapid economic BOOM
2021-05-03 10:03:59,wallstreetbets,But he’ll also get 0.0881 of one share in cash. They don’t just steal the remainder. You’ll get 3 shares (0.75 * 4) and then you’ll get the remainder in cash (0.8381 - 0.75) which is 0.0881 * s.p. of Tilray.
2021-05-03 10:29:39,wallstreetbets,yeah but apha owns 63% so tlry shares are actually worth less? uncertain
2021-05-02 21:21:20,wallstreetbets,You wont lose shares. That guy is trolling
2021-05-03 00:49:38,wallstreetbets,I forget the exact context but there was some guy who posted about how his broker cashed out his position in a stock merger. I don't think that's the case here but it might be possible
2021-05-02 20:59:17,wallstreetbets,They were also lower because they bought Sweet Water.
2021-05-03 11:47:03,wallstreetbets,What he said
2021-05-03 10:12:50,wallstreetbets,"Nope! Just checked, you lose the remainder in cash :/ They round down, so per them, the most you can lose is 0.99 share"
2021-05-02 21:27:03,wallstreetbets,"assumed so, thatd be wildly deadly."
2021-05-03 03:33:30,wallstreetbets,They do this on cash app with mergers for some reason. It happened to me once on a stock ...glu mobile. I had already sold before they notified me of what was going to happen for more of a profit. But yeah
2021-05-02 21:00:05,wallstreetbets,Add that to the list of upside potential
2021-05-03 11:48:10,wallstreetbets,You must have a shite broker

2021-05-03 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Clover Health - A mini DD on $CLOV  

&#x200B;

Get clover health ($CLOV) …. Why you ask?

&#x200B;

Lets break it down:

This was a Chamath SPAC at $10 … and then went to $17…. Okay good stuff.

Then some shit short selling report from Hidenburg research came out accusing them of some bad practices and a DOJ investigation.  That shit was overhyped and short sellers jumped on that and started shorting…. They shorted it down to about 7 bucks, that was a hella bargain price to get in it. Lots of companies get summoned to provide information by the DOJ, its really not a big deal, but was overhyped.

Now this company is legit.  Clover Health is a Medicare Advantage insurer that combines technology and preventive care to lower costs and increase the quality of life. 

&#x200B;

\- They have not yet made an announcement, but they just got approved to expand in 10 more states. That is massive.

\- Biden and democrats are looking to lower the medicare eligibility age to 60. That will help Clover get a bunch of new customers.

\- Short interest is above 35% … so yes possible squeeze potential too.

\- Board of directors has got Chelsea Clinton on it, and she is obviously tight with the democratic party. 

\- They moved earnings up…. Which is usually a good sign.

\- There are 360k calls expiring on May 21, and earnings are a couple days before on May 17th. (only 56k puts, so the call to put ratio is pretty damn high)

&#x200B;

This has got some real potential to double by earnings, maybe even more.

 I got in a bit late and bought high, dont be me and get in early on monday!

Position: 4531 shares at $10.72 - and (16) May 21st, $11 call options. Link to position proof.

Doing earnings after market close throws a flag up for me that a company may have missed a metric or has some bad news and hopes that a night will cool things off the next day.
2021-05-02 22:08:17,wallstreetbets,Yeeeeeet

Some ambulance chasing dirtbag law firm smells a quick hopeful settlement check throws words around like class action searching for bagholders.

Congratulations.  You just learned a valuable lesson about due diligence, the stock market, and pioneer products.  MVIS is certainly not a ""scam,"" and you will surely see a positive ROI in time (possibly a very substantial one) assuming you don't sell at a loss.

If you allow FOMO and lazy ignorance to influence your buys, then you deserve to lose.   A bad attitude only shows that you are either new to investing or a fuckwit."

Comparing the dollar index and the stock market like this is completly retarded.   


One is a index comparing the dollar to a bunch of other currency, ofc it's ratios are that wich makes it look the most favorable to the USD aka the biggest relative currencies are the euro and yen, wich are absolutley horrible. I mean you are comparing cheap taiwanese made toilet paper for slaves to nice toilet paper that has been in a open container in a damp basement, really not that much difference. It's both just different kinds of toilet paper.   


Now how on earth does the increase demand for Yen and Euro compared to the relative lower demand for dollar have anything to do with the demand for US Equities?  


If anything it would affect commodity prices heavily,(it has) wich would in sort be negative for equities, cause the companies would have to pay more costs to manufacture and produce goods wich in turn turns into inflation or less company profit, none wich are very good for equities historically."

2021-05-03 09:50:51,wallstreetbets,"Yup , our real estate market is fucked. And the government is acting like its normal.... some party here want the offers to be public so people stop overbidding but i dont think nothing will be done about it... 

Many will be fucked in 5 years at their renewal with the new, probably way higher rates. We went from 1.84% rates to 2.30% rates in 3 weeks.. Can expect to go higher once the key rate is set back up. 

These 5 years terms will catch up to so many people. Because , houses being sold over 100k more than evaluation. Bid wars make people put a loan to their maximum capacity, and its all good of course because the rates are low now... low rates on higher price leads to higher paiements, and to even higher paiements in 5 years....  and while a raise in rates is calculated , many other things are not calculated.

We can think that within 5 years, by the time people have to renew, covid will be thing of the past and the economy will be back up, which means rates will go up. The key rate was set at a historic low for the bubble not to burst while economy suffered. But once things go back to normal, the key rate will go back up, and the rates will follow. Add to this that evaluations are due , mostly from 2017 , so taxes will be higher too after new evaluations prices,  and we may see some rates increase on taxes too to pay for all the debts we got from covid help programs so higher taxes on higher prices... this already should ring bells...  Then there will be inflation. The grocery alone already costs so much more, then therell be the price of basically everything. And the salaries that will go up, but not enough to follow the raise of everything, leaving a greater hole in a budget.

All these things arent calculated and thats where it will become too much on many peoples finances. 

My gf and I had planned to buy on the coast, far from the city because they still have good prices and better quality of life, but my gf mom got sick and we had to change our projects. We looked around the city and its ridiculous how people are buying high and fighting for their overpriced homes... 

I can only think at how many people will regret that we dont have 25 years terms here when theyll have to renew their mortgage.

2021-05-03 10:03:51,wallstreetbets,">The real estate market is going nuts in Canada. houses going up 100k in a matter of months. yet. the government says there is no inflation

Real estate has gone up due to COVID.  Social-distancing = fewer people comfortable with strangers traipsing around their property = fewer homes on the market = decreased supply.  Combine that with: extreme isolation + additional funds from the state + more funds from the state = increased desires for change of scenery = increased demand.  Decreased supply + increased demand = price-increases."

The people who are buying at the higher cost- wont be able to sell at that.  If your buying to stay in it forever-  it’s a good deal.  If not, you may get stuck."

2021-05-03 10:33:17,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m realizing when I finally do want to buy a home I will move out of this state. I can’t justify spending 500k on what they’re offering.
2021-05-02 21:39:14,wallstreetbets,"Same here in Australia. People are offering 20% more than the asking price on houses around here.

You could grab a brick 3 bedroom house for $500k aud 2 years ago, you can’t even buy a knockdown shack for the same price now. Some houses have literally doubled in the last 4 years."
2021-05-02 23:45:32,wallstreetbets,"That’s so cheap compared to Hong Kong.
Wish I could pay that amount for a 2 bedroom apartment."

2021-05-03 09:35:00,wallstreetbets,"I paid $129k for my  3 bed/2bath+bonus room house in a relatively small city in West Kentucky just north of Nashville 2 years ago.

It's currently valued @ $145k and expected to increase another 16.5% within the next 6 months. A house up the road from me that is pretty similar minus the garage just sold for $175k. Another house a few down from me just got put in the market for $120k and is worth maybe $99k just based on square footage. Was on the market for all of a week and is pending sale.

Canada is definitely leading the way in the bubble but prices seem to be skyrocketing everywhere."

They still use the figure 11 million undocumented though that was years ago and the big ivy league study that said it's at least double that... Foreign home buyers/investors with no vacancy taxes keeping homes empty to tighten supply.  Politicians, environmentalism, ( permitting and red tape, zoning) corruption,  flippers greed, slap new carpts and paint and new windows and up the price 100k and there's someone will pay, everything you can imagine.  The Freddie and fannie  corruption and the community reinvestment act, Barney Frank, and certain politicians from both parties pushing..

2021-05-02 22:09:36,wallstreetbets,"Also the impact of tariffs on wood from Canadian mills continues to cause elevated prices for American construction firms...which isn't necessarily a temporary event.

Our business uses wood sheet goods, lumber, stock steel and aluminum, and chemicals for plastics, epoxy, and rubber --- the past year and a half all of our 'raw material' costs have been edging up which has been affecting our bottom line to the extent that normally we block in 10% of any given job is usually reserved for material costs and we have had to increase it to 17%."

2021-05-02 20:48:27,wallstreetbets,"It's kinda bizarre how the fate of inflation, and maybe even our standing as an economic dominant country, is strongly influenced by whether people believe inflation will happen or not, and then it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.

Its like in Warhammer40K, the Orcs  believe red paint makes things go faster, and because they all collectively 100% believe that, red paint makes their stuff go faster.

Regardless, Powell is working on his acting chops, coming to the podium each time all cool calm collected saying inflation is exactly where it should be.  If he so much as breaks a sweat, the market will probably go haywire and panic."

2021-05-02 20:27:51,wallstreetbets,We'll see.  Oil is gonna have to be well north of 100 bucks a barrel before I'll buy into the inflation thing.  It was in the 90s a decade ago.
2021-05-02 21:06:23,wallstreetbets,Agreed. The fed creates inflation and only the fed can reduce it. IMO
2021-05-02 22:44:31,wallstreetbets,Big players significantly delevered a long time ago. They knew the interest rate environment wouldn't hold but that has nothing to do with maintaining a growing foothold in the markets. Yeah inflation is concerning but it's not coming from nowhere and it's not a secret that the Fed is creating a QE backstop that isn't going away anytime soon.

I'm having trouble believing that small towns and villages in Canada are selling single-family homes for $500k CAD/$410k USD unless we are talking 2 or 3-story, very large houses, or ones that have massive lots. What kind of houses we talking? 

For comparison Miami's housing market is up something like 90% over the past few years and the median sale price is $355k USD, or LA which is up more than that averages $650k USD.

You mean to tell me Canadian **villages and towns** are selling homes for 2/3rds of what it costs to live in LA?"

2021-05-03 16:18:53,wallstreetbets,"I am so glad that my small town hasn't seen this crazy housing boom yet, I really think its because we are just too far removed from big centers.

I was looking at a nice, remodeled one for about 175k, but figured I can easily do my own work during the winter AND buying in at 105 means no mortgage vs 175 (I know, I know...rate are low, but I would rather have zero debt then the 1.5%). 
On the flip side, my brother is also trying to buy a house in a large city, houses there are consistently going for WELL ABOVE list....which to me is just crazy, since I threw a low ball offer that was a bit over 10% below list value and only got one counter offer (2.5k higher then my original offer), but I held my ground with the argument ""it needs a new hot water heater"" and the owner decided to sell at my offered price."

2021-05-03 08:46:47,wallstreetbets,"2008 was different, as many of the properties were owned by people who could not and would never be able to keep up with their mortgages. The cause of the crash was backs realizing that their CDOs were all toxic and no one wanted to trade any because no one wanted to trade. Liquidity dried up.

Nowadays, most buyers seem to be spending cash. No debts, no mortgages, no “leveraging phase”, as Ray Dalio would put it, that swings the cycle upwards, and ends in deleveraging. 

I do sense a bubble—if this isn’t the euphoria phase of asset-buying I don’t know what is—but the “pop” will need to be something drastic from the outside, the only thing that can deflate it naturally would be more houses being built—inventory, or supply, to keep up with the demand—and right now construction materials are so inflated that that’s not a possibility or more under consideration for many. Interest rates may only slow down families and folks who couldn’t afford to pay cash—and many of those have already been priced out."

2021-05-03 12:46:18,wallstreetbets,"You don’t get it. In a deflationary environment people don’t buy stocks as much because just sitting in your money gives a guaranteed decent return. You buy stocks and make other investments / ventures because if you don’t, inflation will destroy you over time. Inflation maintains a certain amount of money transfer in an economy, which is vital to its health. Velocity of money is a concept you need to educate yourself on. It’s intimately connected to inflation."

2021-05-02 21:30:20,wallstreetbets,"hence the current FED Prayer ""This inflation is only temporary"" is said after every meeting. 

Trying to get people to expect short term price increases to prevent a runway price setting of consumer wage increases. 

Once wages start to increase and people expect next years prices to be a increasing rate higher  inflation cycle has kicked in and it becomes a runaway situation. 

So you got two issues Price increases and the then the rate of the increases. The second derivative problem. 


If People think prices are only going to increase by 3% per year for the next 3 years the only issue you have is that inflation is at 3% and stuck there.

If people think prices are going to increase by 3% next year and then 4%  and 5% the following 3 years now you got a major fucking problem and run away inflation as people think the rate of change is increasing by 1% and try to get a head but by trying to get a head only results in the rate of change increasing faster.


The Fed saying expect inflation to be temporary is them telling people to expect situation 1. IE if we think people are planning for situation 2 we will hit the brakes and pull the emergency release of high interest rates of say 5-9% for a ball park.


Last time the US had run away inflation interest rates went above 10% and caused the second worse recession since the depression."

I don't think this is an exact replica of the situation.  In 2008, market hype drove housing prices up, with poors taking out huge loans they couldn't afford because ""housing never goes down"".  

This is different, this is riches realizing that inflation will turn their m(b)illions into not as much buying power over the next two years.  Real estate is a good property sink to put money because in huge inflation the value of a home \*should\* explode as well, meaning that you cash out your real estate investment later for much more, preserving your dollar buying power.  

So this time it's not bad loans.  It's your Musk and Bezos' real estate firms buying up properties left and right to hold for inflation instead (evidence: 1 in 5 homes being sold in major markets right now doesn't have anyone lined up to move in)"

I don't think all of this comes together into cohesive logic at all.  You say the value of the dollar and gold are both assigned by humans, but only gold's value is arbitrary?  You say that a dollar is valuable because it's scarce but not too scarce...in what way is that not potentially true of some marginal quantity of gold?  You seem to be saying they're the same, but then using that as an argument for fiat.

>and of course, it’s accepted pretty much everywhere in the U.S. try to go to a gas station and buy something with gold. 

This is *literally only the definition of a fiat currency*.  If gold were our currency, it would be accepted at gas stations in some form.  Of course.  That's how tender works."

They don't 'have to' pick entire sectors. They could pick an individual person if they wanted.

Planned economies are bad, and I specifically hate their plans for the economy.

Unsustainable growth disconnected from the actual desires of individuals and real resources is not a good thing.

2021-05-03 14:04:37,wallstreetbets,Yacht clubs in the early part of the 20th century in rural locations were typically collectively owned. The earliest examples were collectives of yacht owners who rented land together and built docks on the water portion of the property. Their docks were mostly made out of redwood by cheap local contractors. As time went on and expenses rose for insurance and lumber it became unfeasible for a collective like a yacht club to maintain the facilities so they tended to incorporate as a separate entity with the yacht club coterminous with a new marina business. What we call a marina was often referred to as a yacht club in the 1940’s and 1950’s. Many marinas carried on this naming convention because it sounded rich and impressive even though they had incorporated as for-profit businesses. Do you want to explain more to me about the Marina business which my family has been in for 70 years?

Is the thought ..that GME will hit its peak again at over 300 a share? Or more?  Or is another 75 to 100 gain appropriate?  Or is the potential gain lays in a futures Or option activity that is still to manifest? If so..what is the configuration?

I am asking to learn...
And I am not able to buy in anyways right now...

I am truly seeking knowledge.

GME seems to be the only stonk with longevity, a second wind, and a significant amount of people refusing to sell. Other than AMC to a lesser degree I suppose. Pretty ridiculous timing for the company to begin a major turnaround in the midst of all this though so that could be a big factor in why the price is still so high.

I hope more of my apes see that the stock is pretty and has a good chance of yielding  🍌🍌🍌 for apes sooner than believed. With more apes moon is closer than previously thought. ""All I want to know is whoooooose with me ?"" In my half baked voice."

2021-05-03 01:01:07,wallstreetbets,😬

2021-05-03 02:32:18,wallstreetbets,3 months? Try since before you retards made it a meme stock...October i think. I knew it was going up when they announced AND will go up again in July by beating earnings and revenue AND the American Jobs act will pass by then with it's Broadband and 5g improvements and expansion AND Italy just booted Huawei out and so will the rest of Europe 🇪🇺 🚀🚀🚀

2021-05-03 03:06:07,wallstreetbets,If you’re looking at their projections and everything going as planned this could be 20$ stock in 2-3 years. 21 is a turn around year and the stock could reach 6$. 22-23 this stock should start flying
2021-05-03 03:06:27,wallstreetbets,I bought the literal peak
2021-05-03 03:28:25,wallstreetbets,Bought in at $3.50 and sold during the run up to $7.50. Expected to hold a lot longer but it kinda fell in my lap.
2021-05-03 03:41:38,wallstreetbets,"I am holding my NOK 250@4.88$ bought in february!

Time to Bullish"
2021-05-03 03:43:19,wallstreetbets,I bought in high in January and was a little concerned that I made a mistake. But seeing the latest earning report gave me confidence that I have made the right decision. Holding Nokia for the long haul.

2021-05-03 07:54:52,wallstreetbets,"I should have been buying more NOK at the dips but I ended up spreading my money too thin around different stocks that didn't pan out. 

If it dips again though, I'll probably buy some more. Might have to sell the shares in the stocks that haven't done anything.

I legit dunno if they were worth buying. I just kinda threw money at the wall like the ape I am."

2021-05-03 08:28:29,wallstreetbets,"NOK delivered a lot of good news on the last days. So they jumped up. The 38 EMA ist crossing the 200 EMA. That´s positiv, so they should rise.

2021-05-03 10:16:50,wallstreetbets,Ngl I only kept 69 shares for the culture. Planning to just hold for the history of it. Definitely not buying any more after the fuckery of January.
2021-05-03 10:21:16,wallstreetbets,I just bought 200 $12 calls. Let's hope they pay off
2021-05-03 10:23:24,wallstreetbets,3 months?! Shit... have had 1K+ shares since 2010 (was $12 then).
2021-05-03 10:37:31,wallstreetbets,"I'm totally with you.  My woman was upset with me two months ago, because I bought NOK.  Now, she gently said ""You should buy some more.""  So payday is in two days, and I'm buying as much as I can."
2021-05-03 10:38:10,wallstreetbets,I've been bag holding 3k shares at 4.74 for a bit now.
2021-05-03 10:44:38,wallstreetbets,Will keep holding this for a long time to come. Still a lot of growth left there.

2021-05-02 22:27:55,wallstreetbets,Translation: I'm bagholding NOK at $6 and started to convince myself that they're actually a good investment so I can feel better about my stupid decision.
2021-05-03 00:25:58,wallstreetbets,You spelled GME wrong
2021-05-02 20:41:31,wallstreetbets,"I want you to be the next DFV story.

3 years from now you like the stock breh."
2021-05-02 21:00:43,wallstreetbets,"Hahahaha thanks for the good laugh. It's a shame it wasn't a joke, but I'll take it."
2021-05-02 21:11:35,wallstreetbets,"Yup, bought in in January.

I actually expected for this stock to slide down to around the 3 - 3.50 mark over the course of the year so the past few weeks have been a nice surprise.  

We’ll see, though."

2021-05-03 10:29:51,wallstreetbets,"I had a bunch of 5/21 4$ calls from a couple months ago. Got bored, sold and used all the money on weeklies. Now the money is gone and NOK is up"

2021-05-02 20:34:49,wallstreetbets,"He's not. Check a ten year NOK chart, that's all the unbiased non-confirmation you need to see it isnt going anywhere."
2021-05-02 20:35:52,wallstreetbets,It's been $4-$6 for the last ten years. That should tell you where the next ten years you'll be

2021-05-02 20:08:28,wallstreetbets,"Help will be here one way or another, the point is to be in the vehicle prior to liftoff and endorse your stock to everyone you know that is interested in a play so they research and do the same. Build the momentum don't wait on it...Be the momentum!"
2021-05-02 20:10:25,wallstreetbets,Let's gooooo. If I reach 1000 before liftoff I will be increasing goal to double that.
2021-05-02 20:53:20,wallstreetbets,"Average down so you have more topside if you can...if not I understand. We will catch everything between here and $9 otw to 10, then 100, then 1000, then...?"
2021-05-02 21:36:36,wallstreetbets,"I love how these idiots use these ‘conservative’ numbers.

It’s never 2x undervalued, it’s 20x

‘This is an easy 100x’ - everyone in those shitty scam subreddits trying to manufacture some P&D scheme."
2021-05-03 09:18:19,wallstreetbets,It will never 20x.
2021-05-02 21:05:57,wallstreetbets,They are planning buyback and possibly bringing dividend in play. This is indicative of turnaround and inticement to investors to hold it in longer. So in short...yes it is worth more than Verizon on what is in line for the company and a radiating growth plan that further extends their reach into technology on the whole.
2021-05-02 20:11:53,wallstreetbets,Preach! The time for prayer must end. Stocks move on faith and rumor. I've had faith and the rumors are getting louder! We will be victorious!

2021-05-02 20:23:49,wallstreetbets,"Watch how you say that, remember, I don't fuck...but that sounded like sex to me when you said you're riding it. I almost thought about trying to buy more today until I remembered it's Sunday"
2021-05-02 21:24:19,wallstreetbets,Ain't it nice!?
2021-05-02 20:54:56,wallstreetbets,"Cause they were down? Maybe...or maybe you too, knew you were on to something. We will find out. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕"
2021-05-02 21:26:39,wallstreetbets,That's what tf I'm talmbout...good DD! Partnerships already look interesting before AT&T. Now it's looking like NOK is setting up for world supremacy as a tech hardware company.

2021-05-03 13:52:59,wallstreetbets,"More surprise incoming, we are gaining volume, and the market is down while NOK is on a 4.5% rise with no news that matters. This tells me that more are researching. The rumors are gaining momentum so buyer are coming! I have it on good research that they are more than rumors! I love the stock!"
2021-05-03 11:40:09,wallstreetbets,"My original re entry on the Fuckery was @6.50, I averaged down to 4.17 and am in the gains. IMO, anything under 6 is a buy opportunity. Just start small and build in the dips! I did it and I'm now 20%+ green. And buying more on the rise. New share count is 470 and proudly pushing towards 1000 shares slowly. This has been my strategy at least. Not financial advice, tho. Honestly, I just love the stock!"
2021-05-03 11:55:39,wallstreetbets,I love your Ape strength and conviction.
2021-05-03 12:24:56,wallstreetbets,I love you for being an ape just the same
2021-05-03 13:30:38,wallstreetbets,"That's great, but this post was meant for holders of NOK. GME is no longer in my range to provide support so I will concentrate on NOK along with everyone else here. GME doesn't need luck or anything so I will say congrats! NoK needs support on the psychological side and volume on market side. I love this stock! It was my personal pick and I'm sticking with it. Still love your ape mind!"
2021-05-03 13:35:36,wallstreetbets,"I love you ape! Our time is approaching. With or without the opinions against, we will shoot for the moon. IDGAF if I wake up with a gray beard just to see the stock broke 50 with my last breath I would die with a smile, knowing that NOK was a bet for the ages. Apes will win...end of story."

2021-05-02 21:03:22,wallstreetbets,IQ what's that? The pictures told me everything and I'm drawing all of this in crayon on a new NOKIA device that translates crayon scribble to diction.  I'm just staring at the 🌙 in broad daylight.
2021-05-03 18:41:00,wallstreetbets,LOL - I was bagholding NOK at over $6 & thought I would end up holding them forever.  Averaged down by picking up more when it dipped under $4. Now just figuring out when to exit.
2021-05-03 00:29:27,wallstreetbets,"Nice one, you almost got me. Congrats on GME. I have faith that she ain't done but can no longer support financially. NOK gets all my money till my position target is reached."
2021-05-02 22:20:11,wallstreetbets,Wym 🤡...I'm up. I don't need saving 20% up to be exact
2021-05-02 20:19:14,wallstreetbets,I love you! And your sunshine attitude...either fuck me or shut up cause I really don't fuck and the things you say make me horny! Lol JK I think?
2021-05-02 20:22:08,wallstreetbets,"Get back in on the dip Monday and slide out again. Sounds like phone sex at that point, wash, rinse, repeat! Cmon ik you want to...dumb shit is addictive when nobody believes it will prosper and it does!"
2021-05-02 20:49:40,wallstreetbets,I actually trended sideways down by @40%+ because I bought in @6.50 on the drop and then bottomed @3.89 before even seeing $4 buys...if I'm not mistaken and my memory serves me. But I double and triple averaged to 4.17 and 450 shares and voila topside
2021-05-02 23:03:46,wallstreetbets,Believe and average down.
2021-05-02 23:04:22,wallstreetbets,I don't expect it tomorrow but I see it in its future
2021-05-02 22:07:20,wallstreetbets,We will indeed. Ty for your not having hands of paper!
2021-05-02 22:10:27,wallstreetbets,"I am there as well breh. This was a vent post and support check...not just for myself but for everyone here to know that they still have support! If it becomes the move for tomorrow it would be great. If not, I will buy towards target. Till takeoff. Stay the course and educate with tru and thorough DD and the sto will gain momentum."

2021-05-03 14:06:14,wallstreetbets,"Contract with Samsung to provide video technology. Now why would a heavyweight like Samsung need NOK, not to mention, they also released their 5G touch phones under $500 and so far have good reviews on construction of devices, and performance. Are you sure window phones are the only way? Considering the fact that Windows is now working with Android the same way that they planned on with the window phones?

 I love this stock!"
2021-05-03 14:02:07,wallstreetbets,"OK I won't, but if you look at their activity over the last year, you would see what is coming down the line...growth and lots of it. Contrary to popular belief, this is not a telecomm play. This is a technological hardware play. They have lots of newly partnered deals and government contracts in many countries for 5G infrastructure, no longer in debt, Share buyback incentive coming, and possible dividend return. Even without dividend, they have 22000 tech patents, of which 3500 are vital to the development of 5G...oh yea you told me NOT to mention, my bad!"
2021-05-03 13:50:02,wallstreetbets,"Hard to say if other apes will come back, but no doubt that the stock will pop repeatedly. EoY PT for me is $10+. Today would be nice to hit 5 during market hours and see how much of a push we can get AH. Realistically, she can rip right past previous resistance levels @6 with a couple of institutions jumping in at the right time. They too, will average down with opportunities available. If they decide to bring back dividends, then it's a rap! Not sure if they will, but I do know that they also plan to initiate buybacks starting with 5M shares."
2021-05-03 18:56:29,wallstreetbets,They actually started buying back shares in March and bought near 10M shares
2021-05-03 10:47:58,wallstreetbets,I had 4/30 C$4.5 I picked up for $.39. How the hell did you not sell last Thursday? Sold mine off at $.84 was the action on the $5 calls that bad?
2021-05-03 14:38:27,wallstreetbets,"I love you ape!

I love this stock!"
2021-05-03 09:16:05,wallstreetbets,It would take a monumental event for NOK to even double in value. The free float available is insane and there’s some more tough years of restructuring ahead. If you’re looking for something to “moon” this is about as poor of a choice as there is. Just my opinion.
2021-05-03 10:42:22,wallstreetbets,"So are you watching it? If so, ik you're kicking yourself."

2021-05-02 20:52:13,wallstreetbets,"I'm in nok, and will be building upon my position until it reaches 10 then let it ride for next 3-5 years after and reevaluate"
2021-05-03 05:33:39,wallstreetbets,That’s not how any of this works. Why not invest your money in something that will go up for the next 3 years and then buy NOK?
2021-05-03 16:32:16,wallstreetbets,"Yes I sold the $5.50s several times now moved to the $6.00.

I also sold naked puts a while back for 50% share increase got assigned and sold those into a pop. I think my avg is under $2 or close to $2 

Wish they would calculate that in my account but advanced strategies mean you have to track by he profit as a cost average yourself"
2021-05-03 09:12:45,wallstreetbets,"My calls sold, and got assigned because they only sold at 4.50 strike"
2021-05-03 00:10:14,wallstreetbets,That part👆. He found a strategy that hedged the position and averaged down @the same damned time. I  love it! And I love this stock!
2021-05-03 04:45:13,wallstreetbets,This is so cringe
2021-05-03 00:15:41,wallstreetbets,500 @ 4.75$ here
2021-05-02 21:14:28,wallstreetbets,Ten years of short activity tells me nothing. They are buying back their shares to the tune of 5M. That says they have faith in their plan and financials are no longer an issue...but you can rely on your charts. I rely on knowledge of tech and financial analysis as well as future outlook instead of past only. But don't believe me ...just watch!
2021-05-02 20:46:20,wallstreetbets,"Fine by me. If the stock isn’t going anywhere, I ain’t going anywhere."
2021-05-03 00:12:13,wallstreetbets,"Indeed, if you meant now."

Regardless I love this stock!"
2021-05-03 18:52:29,wallstreetbets,"Never? Maybe not this year or next but never is a bet I'll take. $100 target will not be hard with them buying back $550M worth of their own stock, then if they bring back dividend yield, they will gain large long term investors. That means more support and demand less supply as well because we will still buy?"
2021-05-02 23:05:00,wallstreetbets,"""They are planning buyback and possibly bringing dividend in play"" ?  Would you have the source(s) ?  Thanks."
2021-05-03 00:50:48,wallstreetbets,😂😳
2021-05-02 20:56:13,wallstreetbets,"It'll probably be 20 cents cheaper next week.  If I'm wrong,  I'm wrong."
2021-05-02 22:32:56,wallstreetbets,"100% I could have took off at $9 and change! I believe that this company will succeed long term. It’s only a matter of time! Once the dividend’s are reinstated and at least one round of stock buybacks happen, we will be sitting pretty on the Fucken 🌝! It’s been a crazy ride and it’s only gonna get crazier! Buckle up fellow tards! 🚀"

2021-05-03 10:50:38,wallstreetbets,"Look  at it this way, the fact that I didn't let's you know that there is a bigger play in the background and I am a fuggin bull shark... all because,
I   L O V E   T H I S   S T O C K!!!"
2021-05-03 10:44:16,wallstreetbets,"I value it just the same. Long play for me, but I know what I know...and this is a good entry point still!"
2021-05-03 10:44:41,wallstreetbets,"Grabbed 20 @ 4.98 like the dumb ape I am back in January, haven't sold a single share since. Not much, but it's been fun watching it climb back to where it was. Staying in until it doubles, be it next week or next year."
2021-05-03 00:32:51,wallstreetbets,I am married so no sex for me. Lol
2021-05-02 20:02:15,wallstreetbets,Just buy more nok
2021-05-03 07:50:17,wallstreetbets,"The way I see it, who says NOK won’t gradually move up and I’d like to be a part of that. Also, the amount of money I have invested, I am ok with sitting for that period of time."
2021-05-03 11:08:39,wallstreetbets,"I value your thoughts, however the rating has been upgraded to hold for a reason, and based on the fact that more buyers are rolling in soon implies hidden momentum possible. You know what you know, as do I. And for the record NOK is up for me! I could have sold at the beginning of the week. I am here because I love this stock. Do what you li,e with your money, NOK get the powder from my teddies as she goes! To the moon!"
2021-05-03 12:25:37,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, nervous?"

2021-05-02 23:40:24,wallstreetbets,"I own 240 shares, buy 1-10 if happens to be below 4 on a Monday (depends on what cash I have on hand that particular Monday). I agree that they could come back to life, especially with different EU countries backing away from Xiaomi's 5G tech. But ... they're buying back shares after pretty hefty dilution. In February, the board resolved to issue 21M more shares. So -5M isn't really bullish as they dump 4x that onto the market."

2021-05-03 19:04:32,wallstreetbets,"They’d have to mass produce perfect electric cars to get to $100 a share. Watch out pulling out round targets like $100, if it’s not calculated based on projections and what a realistic market cap would be it’s worthless."
2021-05-03 18:47:51,wallstreetbets,I'm up close to 20%
2021-05-02 23:10:19,wallstreetbets,Read thru the post. I'm sure someone has the link. It was actually on the news
2021-05-02 21:19:57,wallstreetbets,"I hope it would so I can buy even more than I plan to. The problem is, without some serious down pressure the stock doesn't drop that much for very long without trending back where it came from and beyond 1 penny at a time. That's why each penny is multiplied by number of shares, so small moves in stock equal big moves in portfolio....the gamble!"
2021-05-03 02:46:13,wallstreetbets,I don't see buybacks in it's future...way too many stocks more like a reverse stock split...maybe 10 to 1
2021-05-03 02:40:31,wallstreetbets,That part

2021-05-03 04:13:22,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
2021-05-03 14:24:00,wallstreetbets,"Definitely possible, even @20, NOK would be greatly undervalued"
2021-05-03 12:05:55,wallstreetbets,I love this stock. I love the DFV in all of us!
2021-05-03 17:23:31,wallstreetbets,"Not dead for long, we try and push before more institutions load in, Blackrock and Vanguard are in already! They don't play to lose!"
2021-05-03 02:41:33,wallstreetbets,"Ik, I will be back after these messages...NOK messages that is!"

If so, then they will need to wash, rinse, repeat as they meet goals. The reason I am bullish though is on the aspect of partnerships and infrastructure contracts in countries around the world. They are under rated, under valued and overly aggressive on positioning themselves. This is merely my forecast and in no way financial advice. Just an ape that loves this stock!"

2021-05-03 11:43:02,wallstreetbets,They have lots of 5G and iot potential. Just need better leadership. Looks like maybe they have it now?

2021-05-03 12:33:36,wallstreetbets,That is not what apes do. Go put your money in BRK/b if you want steady growth.

2021-05-02 22:01:16,wallstreetbets,Good bot lol.
2021-05-03 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Poor Man's covered calling a house. Hear me out apes I think I may of found an exploit that can be utilized for maximize leverage with downside protection through housing.

First you take advantage of the historically booming mortgage market and low interest rates by taking out as many mortgages as you can afford through a mortage brokers tied to a public traded stock (RKT for example).  Then using the houses that you now own you take out additional loans which you use the proceeds to wheel (sell calls/puts) into gold/silver/platinum.  As you keep gathering more premium and your house values goes up slowly (while interest rates mostly stay stagnant as the feds are afraid of crashing the market) you take out more loans and sell more puts.  Hopefully by the time the housing market crashes your wheeling account will have accumulated enough in value to pay off its mortagages on it own through wheeling.  Since gold and other commodities tend to go up during market/housing crashes during the downturn you will be able to pay off your mortagages through the gains you will see in your wheeling account.  If housing keeps booming you keep getting more loans out (or sell/pay them off to reduce risk and realize gains).  At some point later on you can sell your housing for nice gains or refinance and take our more mortgages.  If things go sideways your wheeling premiums will keep you afloat, while you slowly whittle away at your mortagages.

The way I see it is your houses you buy is almost like buying a LEAP call so you can sell options covered.

Am i missing something here?  I feel like this is a guaranteed way to make money in this volatile market in the long term."
2021-05-02 20:57:23,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a fantastic idea... please test this for us and report back in 6 months and let us know how it's going.

The housing market is so fucking inflated right now. Our rental properties have gone up over 30k each in the last 2 years and i don't even live in that desirable of a location. When the housing bubble crashes and the price of outdated shit homes go back down you're going to be stuck with so many 200k mortgages on homes that are worth less $150k tops. You're like 4/5 years too late. The time to buy up homes was post housing crash in 2008 when you could buy up neighborhoods in Arizona for a bj."

2021-05-02 21:17:36,wallstreetbets,Bruh take 9k loss and get out not too late before u lose everything. Or u can hold it
2021-05-02 23:21:05,wallstreetbets,Did you misclick calls instead of puts?
2021-05-02 21:02:12,wallstreetbets,I’m surprised these could actually be resold for $17k still

2021-05-03 05:22:45,wallstreetbets,Fucking idiot. Buying calls on an IPO is like betting money that smoking weed will make you more sober.

Coinbase has a bunch of competitors already and that list is only growing.

2021-05-03 07:33:45,wallstreetbets,Never buy calls on newly listed companies. Almost always a guarantee they list over inflated and and early private investors dump for profits as it crashes. I have no idea what coin is actually worth today with their current business model but I highly doubt it was worth any of your strike prices lol
2021-05-03 07:34:03,wallstreetbets,Are you an idiot? Cut your losses immediately and live to fund another another regarded play. Those are are toast.

2021-05-03 00:46:55,wallstreetbets,What’s the kraken fees?
2021-05-03 08:34:44,wallstreetbets,"honestly i dont know why anyone wouldnt be using coinbase pro. you can transfer between coinbase and pro for free instantly, so if you wanted to get the staking interest, you could just move it over after the trade."
2021-05-03 01:07:24,wallstreetbets,Like 5Xs less than coinbase google it lol
2021-05-03 01:50:09,wallstreetbets,Weeeee! I mean I bought on coin long back so may be for next transactions
2021-05-03 08:33:41,wallstreetbets,"both of them depend on volume. if you have little to no volume, they are both 0.5%. kraken is better during some sections and coinbase better on others. if you're trading 500k volume per month, then kraken is best for you based on fees. my problem is that kraken has an additional fee for leaving maker trades up... like a fee per hour. for me, that would kill me, since i leave maker trades up for a month sometimes."
2021-05-03 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"North Korean Wine - Good Investment? Kaesong Koryo Insam is a North Korean wine distributor with exclusive rights over some of NKs most popular alcohol, ""Kaesong Koryo Ginseng Wine"". Last year they attained a temporary one-time exemption from UN sanctions to export wine into South Korea \[1\]. The supply ended up in countries all around South East Asia, mostly Singapore \[2\], however I can't find any examples of it being imported to or sold in North America.

Given the limited supply, national scarcity of an object difficult to transport internationally, eventual historical significance and precedent for overpriced alcohol, how safe of a bet would it be and how much returns could be earned per year, if one where to import a pallet of North Korean wine into North America and hold for a decade or two? Does anyone have any examples of prices of Nazi wine to help project the eventual value of North Korean Wine?

As far as I'm aware taking advantage of this one-time exchange may be our only opportunity to purchase North Korean wine without breaking international trade sanctions.

But comparing nazi germany to North Korea doesnt really make sense. Nazi germany was world changing history. Igniting the last world war. North Korea is wildly less globally important. That said depending on how the state plays out in the long run this could change, though try not to hope for atrocities to increase the wines value."

2021-05-03 03:02:07,wallstreetbets,"Everyone here is making fun of you but you don't seem to be too swayed. I get that you kinda think you have one of those ""go against the grain and show them all up"" type of products here. But I want to hopefully bring you back to reality and save you a shit-ton of money on a bad investment.  


The primary problem with using a physical item as an investment, is that you eventually have to become a salesperson of that item. What this means is proper *marketing* \- which, unless you have some experience in, is MUCH harder than it sounds. ie. just look at any reddit post that says ""I made X"" vs any reddit post that says ""my friend made x"" people HATE self advertisement.   


In a decade from now, you will have paid for the storage cost of the goods, a price you need to factor in, even if it's in your own home it's still an opportunity cost for the space it takes up. Then you have to convince other people that this is an interesting product to the point that there becomes a buying FRENZY so that people can outbit one another to drive the price high enough to make your investment worthwhile.   


You are giving yourself a near impossible task, it's essentially the equivalent of ""create a viral video"" right here and now. If you don't know how to do that, you aren't going to be able to find a buyer for your wine in a decade. If you *are* able to create a viral video right here and now, then you may as well do that instead of spending your money on this god awful investment, because it will sure as hell generate a lot more cash."

That's not what the article says. It says a cooperative of companies in North Korea are party to the deal that will trade multiple things including alcohol.

And that the named company is one of the companies in the cooperative.

Not that it is at all the party providing the wine. It even explicitely says they are a trading company, which implies they wouldn't be the brewer even if they were the ones trading in the liquor."

You see paradoxically, the novelty of their ""100 Trillion Dollar"" notes became valuable shortly after they instated a new currency. These notes, which had once been worthless, are now selling on Ebay for $5-$20 a note, and I expect their value to only go up with time.

If you were to have gone to Zimbabwe shortly before or after the currency was officially phased out and invested USD into Zimbabwe bills, you could have purchased a pile of these bank notes for $10 each, only to sell each note for $10 years later.

I wholeheartedly believe Zimbabwe bank notes are still a good investment, just much less so than they used to be. Anyways this missed opportunity inspired me to take advantage of other countries' instability."

2021-05-03 04:15:35,wallstreetbets,"Thank you very much for your input. It does seem the storage and risk of spoilage/damage would be the largest risk factor aside from the law. I understand the effort necessary to sell physical products, but I have a few years experience in both digital and physical product advertising/marketing, I'm confident I could handle that part, although it'd take quite the campaign to say the least.

I think you're spot on when you sat it's just not worth it, even with a potential for margin, I'm looking at barley beating the market unless I get lucky, and losing everything and even potentially going to jail if it doesn't. Definitely an objectively worse investment than the S&P500 let alone anything higher risk. I just had an inflated expectation of RoI and didn't fully consider the costs/risk associated.

I still intend to buy a few bottles for friends & family as novelty gifts, but if I do I'll also hold a few bottles ""for fun"", it'd be cool to see how much they sell for if I sold one every 5 years or so.

I suspect even North Korean vendors purchase through Kaesong Koryo Insam, although information is scarce.

You need (costly!) licenses to distribute alcohol in this country. You also cannot have a license that grants you BOTH importer/distribution (i.e. wholesale) rights AND point of sale (retail) rights. So, did you factor in the cut you're going to have to give to the retailers? You literally need to start an alcohol import and distribution business to get this done. 

That's even assuming the booze clears customs. Hint: it won't b/c the US has regulations that prevent the importation of goods from NK - doesn't matter what the UN thinks here. 

You need to file TTB label registrations, which will be rejected because NEWS FLASH the country of origin is NK.

If OP is right and this is a rare opportunity to get this wine it probably really is a good investment just because it’s rare. There are alcohol collectors who‘d get a huge kick out of being able to say they’re one of only 1,000 people in the western world who own a bottle of this stuff.

However I recently got unbelievably lucky with an investment of mine, it makes this seem like a safe rational investment in comparison, so I'm feeling a little bullish and manic, especially towards non-traditional/undersaturated markets. I should keep a calm head and save my money but the FOMO is strong."

You cannot become an alcohol importer/wholesaler on the cheap. You cannot store collectible booze for 20 years on the cheap. None of this is cheap. Even getting a cola for this product would be a nightmare lol.
This is all before actually assessing whether the ""wine"" is collectible or not (spoiler: it's not, not in the way op is imagining at least). 

But I do want him to keep trying because the article spawned by this venture will be fire. He just needs to price in a good defense attorney and a new doorframe because the ATF and TTB are going to take offense to all of this lol."

2021-05-03 01:12:38,wallstreetbets,"Nobody got the “most venomous snake” question right. Some great guesses though.

The most popular response was the black mamba. Black mambas aren’t actually the most venomous snake in the world despite being described fairly as the most dangerous. A casual misconception and something I previously thought - the black mamba gets its dangerous reputation for a few other reasons: including its tenacious and aggressive behavior, ability to attack people in poorer countries who typically sleep on the floor, and speed as the fastest moving land snake in the world, maxing at around 12 mph. But above all - the reason the black mamba gets its reputation is because it’s bites have an envenimation rate of nearly 100%. This means untreated, there is a near 100% mortality rate. It possesses the most advanced, evolved, and efficient venom delivery apparatus among all venomous snakes, and the most advanced and evolved dentition of all elapids (family of venomous snakes defined by their permanently erect fangs). In addition, the black mamba poses the largest fangs of anybody in its family. In total, the black mamba kills around 20,000 people every year.

The most venomous snake in the world is actually the Australian based inland taipan. This snake has significantly more venom than even that of any sea snake - which are known to posses more deadly toxins than the typical venomous land snake. Despite all of this, bites and related deaths are extremely rare due to the snakes shy, passive attitude and distance from population centers. For reference of its venoms potency, a maximum venom dose from a black mamba could kill 19 people. A maximum venom dose from an inland taipan could kill 289 people."

To a palace-bower where golden-vested maidens 
Thread with mellow laughter the petals of delight. 

Whither dost thou loiter, by what murmuring hollows, 
Where oleanders scatter their ambrosial fire?

Come, thou silver-breasted moonbeam of de- sire!"

2021-05-02 23:46:53,wallstreetbets,"Actually, I will say this....Things are pretty crazy. My guess is that MVIS is going to go up more and with the the Berkshire news this weekend, it will make APPL more resound as a trade. I do not trade options, but I do follow them. APPL as a trade this is highlighted by the fact that they had blowout earnings once again, everyone buys APPLE products and they have tons of cash on hand as well as the guidelines to begin purchasing over 89 Billion worth of stock in a buyback. Now, for the he downside, my opinion is on the matter of concrete sustainment of upwards growth within this space. I believe that APPL has the support to move higher and on to a new high within the next week or so. Historical data and the chart supports that move. Eventually people will slow down on purchasing and things will slow down as more people get the COVID vacs. I have more to come if I am allowed to eventually start sharing..TIA"

2021-05-02 21:35:20,wallstreetbets,"guaranteed he's doing some iteration of that. maybe not 2k at one price, but like 500 at 200, 500 at 250, 500 at 400 and 400 at 690. He can \*always\* get back in at a dip. That passive income is impossible to pass up. He's very smart, and no way he doesn't do this.  I killed it selling covered calls of GME for weeks and weeks, rarely had them called away, and was thrilled when they did - I would just get back in (I only have 100 shares now, at one point I was up to 2375). between swing/daytrading GME and holding back half my shares to sell CC it's one of the few gains for me this year."

2021-05-02 22:23:18,wallstreetbets,Interest rates go up to combat inflation. Interest rates were like 20% in the 70s or 80s. Why would you be in stocks in you can get a guaranteed 20% on your money in a simple high yield savings account?
2021-05-02 22:25:15,wallstreetbets,"My limited knowledge is: some inflation is good for the stock market. Too much inflation hurts the US dollar, which hurts our economy and position as the prominent currency and stock exchange? Idk though"

2021-05-03 02:00:46,wallstreetbets,"Bro, who gives a fuck if he “takes blame,” the only reason he is backtracking is because of the lawsuit that has his balls in a vice.

I work in tech and can tell you everything about tech companies but I know fuck all about industrials and it makes me apprehensive to invest in them. The ones you’ve mentioned I believe are the new  growth plays at least temporarily. When you look y/y those companies represent the most growth rn obviously because the pandemic basically shit them down entirely last year. The value plays right now I believe are construction, industrials with exposure to raw materials, and financials"

If this was that big a deal the business headlines would have been screaming. What’s in uh oh land are the intl companies with a heavy presence/reliance on India manufacturing/assembly.
2021-05-03 04:52:34,wallstreetbets,India has 1/6th of the world population. We don't. They produce and consume a lot of goods. It's a ripple. It would be almost as bad if China was to close up shop. We're in a world economy.

2021-05-03 01:55:54,wallstreetbets,"Yes absolutely. AR/VR is completely untapped right now and unity can absolutely be a leader in that space. Who knows what the mkt cap for that space will be in 10 years.

 For all application development there is not only competition for customers but also competition for developers. If majority of developers learn your platform then regardless of where they work to create applications they will promote your platform as the tool to make the applications. Being developer friendly is what made AWS the leader in its space and this could happen for unity too although unreal engine (owned by epic) is also a leader in this space. They could both continue to share the market but I anticipate lots of competition between the two and even by Apple or FB if they choose to make their own development platforms for ar/vr. Apple has shown that owning the platform for development (Xcode/swift) is a key factor to success"

2021-05-03 04:57:18,wallstreetbets,"India’s GDP is literally a tenth of ours. I agree that it may affect certain aspects of life but I think at worst the market dips for a couple days.

Anyway, buy puts fagot. Check back with me."
2021-05-03 02:12:32,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the explanation! I appreciate the detailed response. I never thought about the developer Standpoint. I think the rate that Apple and FB are growing it may cause them to have to leave some of these markets due to anti trust. 

That EPIC ipo is going to be insane. I used to work at a video game company(though in accounting) and that unreal engine(and fortnite success allowing them to reduce platform fees is unbeatable) I’m surprised they didn’t IPO this year."

2021-05-02 20:08:10,wallstreetbets,He claimed she was trying to get some of his streaming money because he would feature her. I call bullshit and think he might’ve gotten jealous that she was becoming more popular then he was
2021-05-03 02:34:16,wallstreetbets,"I remember that story and thinking there's no way people actually think he ended things because of that do they.

I'm willing to bet my entire portfolio its because she's either a gold digger who wants more clout or batshit crazy. Instead of saying that he went with call of duty its not you its me."

2021-05-03 03:55:49,wallstreetbets,"I mean. As strange as that may sound when put so bluntly, it was a case of someone breaking up with another person to focus on their career, which happens fairly regularly. It just so happens his career is esports."

2021-05-03 01:17:57,wallstreetbets,    A decision was made
2021-05-03 02:15:48,wallstreetbets,They could put subtitles on her arse and I'd still have trouble reading
2021-05-02 21:11:27,wallstreetbets,Confirmed

2021-05-02 20:46:08,wallstreetbets,"Dude's rich, good looking and plays games/make videos for a living. Think he'll be alright."
2021-05-02 21:07:56,wallstreetbets,"She wanted a cut of his YouTube revenue too iirc and something about wanting to live together but neither could actually move cross country because they both had their careers. Almost like the relationship was DOA. I’m sure there’s some truth to that but he probably had his own issues too he kept to himself and she never exposed.

Either way both of them are probably toxic and no amount of good looks can help with that.

Edit: Also the person you replied to simplifying it as “to just play call of duty” makes it sound pathetic. It’s his career, even if he’s been struggling with it these past several years. Not to defend him but if anyone would choose a girl over their career they’re either abundantly rich and set for life or an idiot."
2021-05-03 04:33:47,wallstreetbets,"Why does it have to be her being crazy? Maybe he is a retard or a mod on Reddit and didn't find her hot? That's from very basic reasons, but it might be that they just weren't good anymore, shit hapoens, whatever, doesn't mean that hot girl is at fault."
2021-05-02 21:29:20,wallstreetbets,Yes they do. They know it's going to be fuvking *hot*.

2021-05-03 05:33:47,wallstreetbets,"That looks like the body standard most/all girls are aiming for. But I think that booty ain't real..  

when you have a voluptuous booty like that, your body would be more curvy at the front. Her body looks designed to have a flat booty. I could be wrong though!
Nevertheless her body looks perfect like this and I would switch immediately. Implants or not.

But it's not the best format to bring men's attention at the graphic. Mine neither btw"

“I see all over social media that I took a big L, that I dumped the hottest girl in the world,” Martin explains. “At first, I thought I’ll roll with the memes. Now, it’s to a point where people generally think this is how it went down.”

García and Martin were a typical youTube couple, until he allegedly pulled the plug on their three-year relationship in July over his burgeoning *Call of Duty* career. Throughout the 15-minute video, Martin flips the script by claiming that García attempted to score a percentage of his YouTube earnings and was controlling over his other relationships.

“Everything started to turn when I mentioned to her how much money could be made on YouTube,” he says. “At this time, YouTube wasn’t really that mainstream. Nobody really respected YouTube as a profession as they do now. So, when she understood how much money I was making on YouTube, she wanted to get a percentage of the videos I was making.”

Without the gallery, it's just a painting of some flowers. I'm not sure Yanet looks any better for stripping down to the same poses as every other slightly pretty girl on the internet. It relegates her to generic airbrushed IG model, even if she is the mold and not the copy."

**Basic Overview of BNGO, Bionano Genomics**

Being the only major player in the optical genome mapping space, Bionano has revolutionized genomics by detecting large structural variations in genomes by reducing the cost per genome, time of operation, and increasing the detection rate while providing a relatively simple platform to work from, rendering the esoteric nature of operating LRS and NGS for large structural variation detection obsolete in many ways.

Their *saphyr* system allows researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for **new diagnostics and therapeutic targets**. “*Large structural variations are responsible for many diseases and conditions*, **including cancers and developmental disorders**. Optical genome mapping with Saphyr detects structural variations ranging from 500 bp to megabase pairs in length and offers assembly and discovery algorithms that far outperform sequencing-based technologies in sensitivity.”

Their next-generation genome mapping and analysis tools **help researchers see true genome structure to fill in what’s missing from sequencing-based data**. Saphyr, their high-speed, high-throughput whole-genome mapping solution, offers unmatched structural variation discovery capabilities and the ability to construct the most complete genome assemblies.

The Saphyr® System by Bionano Genomics is a genome imaging tool for high-speed, high-throughput **structural variant detection** and analysis with exceptional sensitivity and specificity.

**📷**

**TLDF:**

They analyze genomes and produce maps which enable researchers to find information that could be crucial for helping drug enhancements, preventive care, cures, susceptibility awareness and more.

***ApE LaNgUAgE-***

Saphyr finds some things in genomes more efficiently than traditional technologies. So yes, it is cool and we may moon but not primarily because of this.

1. Financials 2021 Revenue Projections, Profitability, Cash Runway

(video format on channel) **-**

Recent History of Revenue

**2020-$8,503,000**

**2019-$10,130,000**

**2018-$12,001,000**

**2017-$9,505,000**

**Avg=$10,034,750**

**Things that are likely to cause increased revenue (total revenue) in 2021**

1. Lineagen acquisition  

   1. BNGO acquired them in August 2020, with **only 5 months** of work in an increased regulatory environment (covid), they brought in **$1.5M in revenue**.  

      1. 1.5M×2 (12 months in year, double amount from 5 months, add a small bit more because 2021 is likely to have less covid restrictions, also of course extra 2 months of revenue {CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATING EXTRA 2 MONTHS AND ADDED REVENUE FROM LESS COVID STIFLES})=3M+200,000 from extra 2 months and less covid restriction benefits

$13,234,750

1. Benefit of cash=new opportunities  

   1. Unlike all years past, Bionano now has **cash for marketing**, more acquisitions, r&d, and plenty of catalysts to look forward to including **saphyr 2.0/higher throughput**, **saphyr’s use in prenatal & postnatal screening**, more saphyr sales, and cytogenetic space. CFO Chris Stewart said that Bionano believes its cash stockpile ""significantly de-risks the company, solidifies our financial future, and allows us to focus on the achievement of our long-term vision to disrupt genomics through the global adoption of Saphyr.""  

      1. 13,234,750+1,500,000=

$14,734,750

1. More recognition=more recognition (domino effect, kinda)  

   1. As more and more labs and universities adopt and approve saphyrs capability and efficiency (like african genetic lab just a week ish ago), others will do the same. It will be similar to how crypt0 got and is getting more recognition from the mainstream as more places adopt it. Bionano has never had interest like it is now nor has it ever had the exposure/popularity it currently has and they will continue to gain and (imo) capitalize on the added attention.

   2. “The company plans a commercial release of prenatal assays and an expansion of the menu of its pediatric assays in Q3.”
   3. “The fourth quarter of 2021 will be an especially busy one. Bionano anticipates the validation of three of its laboratory-developed tests with billing codes. It also expects to have a prototype of its next-generation high-throughput Saphyr system ready.”
   4. “If all goes according to plan, Bionano will finish this year with a much larger installed base. The company projects that it will have 150 systems installed by the end of Q4 2021 -- a 50% jump from the end of 2020.”

BNGO 2021 Revenue Projection-

[**2021 Analyst Projection**](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-bngo/bionano-genomics#future) **- $16,337,000**

**Auspicious Projection - $**21,234,750

(I am not even factoring in the UK or Africa ((which by the way, are both likely to start numerous Saphyr adoptions in a chain of research institutions imo)) Saphyr adoptions to be extra conservative)

Contrarian points (probably bear’s objections to the above\^)

* Lockdowns don’t decrease work efficiency or revenue because people just work from home--
* Analysts know more than retail investors typically so if they are only projecting 16M, why should yours have any more likelihood of actually being right?
* Shouldn't smart money/whales have already priced some of your points into the current SP?
* What is your track record when it comes to revenue projections and why should we believe anything you say?

cant link youtube vids so thx wsb lol ahah, debunking is on teh channel ""Auspicious dissenT"" the '2021 bngo rev. projections)(no disrespect, just jk) - (17:40)

**Some orthodox important points**

**according to** [**simply wall st.**](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-bngo/bionano-genomics)

* Revenue (47.7% per year) is forecast to grow faster than the US market (9.7% per year).
* Forecast to remain unprofitable over the next 3 years.
* Relatively [slow EPS growth](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-bngo/bionano-genomics#valuation) (Positive by 2025).
* Short term assets ($46.8M) exceed its short term liabilities ($8.9M).
* Short term assets ($46.8M) exceed its long term liabilities ($16.4M).
* Debt of 16.3M (relatively low)
* sufficient cash runway for more than a year based on its current free cash flow.
* less than a year of cash runway if free cash flow continues to reduce at historical rates of 16.4% each year

According to [Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/25/buy-these-3-stocks-to-cash-in-on-the-genomics-revo/#:~:text=Importantly%2C%20BioNano%27s%20product%20is%20a%20key%20tool%20in,%28also%20known%20as%20amyotrophic%20lateral%20sclerosis%2C%20or%20ALS%29.)

* Its equipment needs a constant supply of kits for customers to get the data they crave. So its revenue has a significant recurring component which will grow with time as it develops more and more options for applications

My Extrapolation-

With revenue expected to grow between 100% and 150% YOY and a historical stable decrease in cost of revenue we can *expect* a much higher EPS & revenue growth than simply wall st. analysts have projected. However if [operating expenses continue to keep rising](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNGO/financials?p=BNGO) then we could see a revenue and EPS growth similar to that of the analysts projections (not necessarily though if revenue keeps increasing at the current pace, a pace which is not possible to be kept perpetually, but I believe it could be prolonged for at least few years if things go Bionano’s way)

TLDF:

There is an extremely high chance that revenue will grow more than 100% YOY and a high chance of getting closer to 130%-150% growth given the above.

ApE lAnGuaGE

money will grow much faster than what analysts are predicting resulting in bngo go moon and bionanians portfolio’s go brrrr

2. Markets

& Potential Markets, TAM, SAM, SOM and Future TAM, SAM & SOM

(basically listing all revenue sources and likely future sources)

1. Genetic Labs  

   1. Universities, R&D companies, hospitals, scientific institutions, unorthodox educational facilities (more in the ***future*** section), nonprofit hospital system (ex. - [Mayo Clinic](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/mayo-clinic-adopts-bionano-saphyr-for-applications-in-neurodegenerative-diseases-2019))
   2. Cytogenetics  

      1. “$500 million to $600 million from selling Saphyr to cytogenetics labs for diagnostic purposes, along with annual recurring revenues of $200 million to $400 million. There are over 2,500 such labs around the world, the company estimated.” - [INVESTORPLACE](https://investorplace.com/2021/03/bngo-stock-buy-on-innovation/)
      2. TAM of cytogenetics according to CEO in ER call is around 3B, which he said was attributed to all genetic labs essentially, *but* there are many more markets that increase the TAM (not necessarily the SOM, but nonetheless the bigger the TAM, the higher ((probably)) the SOB in the long run and in the aggregate based on my anecdotal non-scientific opinion) significantly.
2. NIPT  

   1. Susceptibility of diseases, proclivity for this sickness or that one, offers the individual a chance to take action to mitigate an increased risk for them *at a young age*, the benefits of this are not researched heavily (obvious reasons) but one can assume that it could be absolutely revolutionizing for health quality, life expectancy & wellness.
   2. WIDE range of various crucial information NIPT can discover (OGM *could* disrupt this industry and/or provide enhancements to the technology capabilities of LRS and NGS)
3. PostNatal Screening  

   1. Validation studies of hematological malignancies and post-natal constitutional disorders have progressed nicely, and management anticipates having data from ""no-call"" reflex testing in NIPS later this year and next year for solid tumors. - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ma9f0t/bngo_bionano_genomics_dd_the_future_of_genomics/)
4. Autism  

   1. CEO, “The wide spectrum of genetic variation between individuals with ASD makes it difficult for traditional tests to provide a diagnosis of the genetic condition. We expect OGM with Saphyr to reveal a more complete picture of genomic variants that provides actionable information that can potentially improve outcomes.” - [source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/04/2152632/0/en/Bionano-Genomics-Publishes-Study-on-Autism-Risk-Genes-After-Detailed-Analysis-of-The-Genome-of-Professor-Temple-Grandin-Who-Has-Brought-Awareness-to-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Throug.html)
   2. The company has [already made breakthroughs](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/04/2152632/0/en/Bionano-Genomics-Publishes-Study-on-Autism-Risk-Genes-After-Detailed-Analysis-of-The-Genome-of-Professor-Temple-Grandin-Who-Has-Brought-Awareness-to-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Throug.html) in the space, it is my belief that the [flywheel effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel_effect#:~:text=The%20flywheel%20effect%20is%20the%20continuation%20of%20oscillations,such%20oscillations%20are%20said%20to%20be%20flywheeling%20.) *could* come into play here
   3. OGM is a relatively new space, given that it essentially only has one real company devoting its time to it (see ***competitors*** and ***history*** section for more info on OGM competition & other companies), it may be likely that as researchers become more experienced, the [learning curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve) will play an important role.
   4. Understanding a whole genome and how it replicates may give us a rudimentary knowledge of how they develop and how to stop it (possible cures, preventatives, mitigations-$$$)  

      1. About 1 percent of the world population has autism spectrum disorder. Prevalence in the United States is estimated at 1 in 59 births. More than 3.5 million Americans live with an autism spectrum disorder.
5. Neurodegenerative Diseases - Alzheimer's, ALS & Possibly Others  

   1. “Dr. Ebbert uses long-read sequencing and Bionano whole-genome imaging because it can identify large structural mutations that cause disease. Many individuals who have neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and ALS do not have a known genetic cause, and studies to date have focused on short-read sequencing, overlooking disease-causing structural mutations. Bionano’s Saphyr provides the potential of long-read sequencing now.” - [source](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/mayo-clinic-adopts-bionano-saphyr-for-applications-in-neurodegenerative-diseases-2019)
   2. More than 3 million Alzheimers cases per year in US  

      1. Around 20,000 ALS cases per year in US - [source](https://www.westernslopenow.com/news/local-news/keenan-van-goes-to-the-11th-als-patient/)
6. Leukemia  

   1. “Dr. Alexander Hoischen reported the results of a successful validation study comparing the performance of Bionano Genomics’ Saphyr® system to traditional cytogenetic methods for the clinical analysis of leukemia genomes. The study, published in bioRxiv, found that Saphyr was 100% concordant with the standard of care for the detection of somatic chromosomal abnormalities.” - [source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bionano-genome-imaging-concordant-traditional-130010495.html)
   2. “We are positively surprised by the smooth and fast implementation of the Saphyr system in our laboratory. Less than a year after training we now have successfully run more than 150 samples, including the 48 leukemia samples which we now present in this publication. Other samples include novel research findings for unsolved rare disease cases and known cytogenetic abnormalities which may validate the Saphyr system’s use for constitutional aberrations.” - Dr. Alexander Hoischen
   3. “Breakthrough Findings in Leukemias Presented at ASH 2019 Demonstrate Bionano Saphyr’s Potential to Replace All Cytogenetic Methods and Show Additional Clinical Utility” - [source](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/breakthrough-findings-in-leukemias-presented-at-ash-2019-demonstrate-bionano-saphyrs)  

      1. About 61,090 new cases of leukemia and about 23,660 deaths from leukemia - [source](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/about/key-statistics.html)
7. ***Cancer*** (has its whole section devoted to it)
8. Miscellaneous, Other  

   1. According to [nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bionano%3A-prenatal-testing-offers-another-opportunity-for-saphyr-says-analyst-2021-04-09), Kevin DeGeeter’s positive outlook for the company is partly based on Saphyr’s potential to impact other markets beyond cytogenetics for hematologic malignancies. Ones where the use of microarrays, FSH and karyotyping also “results in long and expensive analytical decision trees.”
   2. Correcting and discovering genetic abnormalities
   3. Aids for medicines discovered by analyzing whole genomes of diseases that we are oblivious to currently
9. Uses [According to Bionano Themselves](https://bionanogenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Saphyr-Brochure.pdf)  

   1. Undiagnosed Genetic Disorders
   2. Hematologic Malignancies
   3. Gene Discovery and Therapy
   4. Cell Line Stability
   5. Solid Tumor Research
   6. Genetic Engineering Studies
   7. Evolutionary Biology
   8. Reference Genome Assembly
10. IVF/Infertility aids - [#1](https://bionanogenomics.com/bionano-university/articles/bionano-detects-balanced-translocations-in-patients-suffering-from-infertility/) [#2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32026199/) [#3](https://investorplace.com/2021/04/bionanos-uk-deal-is-huge-for-bngo-stock/) (this one is more ‘potential market’ than market)
11. “The authors not only illustrated that the Bionano Saphyr system was a useful and rapid tool for refining the translocation breakpoints to the gene level, they also addressed the potential application of selecting embryos for infertile patients receiving IVF based on Bionano analysis”.
12. “The SMOM (“used on the Bionano platform”) has potential clinical application as a rapid tool to screen patients with BRTs for underlying genetic causes of infertility and other diseases”.
13. “Additionally, one of the labs “will also evaluate Saphyr for the detection of structural variants (SVs) in patients with developmental delay, infertility, rare disease, and other genetic diseases.”
14. (((BONUS)))
15. Just a reminder that analyzing saphyr’s data requires other products that are not cheap and these do not last forever, this means recurring purchasing will be periodically happening (+ saphyr 2.0, all customers who wish to have the 1400x higher throughput Saphyr will need to purchase that).

**Some orthodox important points**

**according to an INVESTORPLACE article**

* TAM - $2.6 billion to $3.8 billion according to [company estimates from prior to March 12](https://investorplace.com/2021/03/bngo-stock-buy-on-innovation/). **(based on below point, the author of** [**this same article**](https://investorplace.com/2021/03/bngo-stock-buy-on-innovation/) **actually means** [**SOM**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_addressable_market#Difference_between_TAM,_SAM_and_SOM)**,** ***if the below point according to the same article is true,*** **‘because the CEO believes they could realistically achieve 2.6-2.9B yearly’)**
* Over 7,000 research labs in the world. Holmlin claimed that Bionano could generate $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion by selling Saphyr to those labs and another $500 million to $1.1 billion in annual recurring revenues.
* The company is conducting 22 clinical tests of the platform in four main areas, prenatal, postnatal, blood cancers, and solid tumors. Based on this data, payors can decide to reimburse the company’s customers for their use of Saphyr.
* Lineagen provides services that cytogenetics labs find attractive, including genetic counseling, certified tests, certified coders, and a large patient database.
* ***Some*** diseases Saphyr has produced new information are ALS, Alzheimer’s, liver cancer, leukemia, and epilepsy.

TLDF:

Given the *plethora of breakthroughs* they have already made and the **learning curve** and **flywheel effect**, I think it is *likely* that many if not all of the potential markets will be penetrated soon and down the line.

22. **More Efficient Consumables & Software** [**Potentially**](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/bionano-prep-kits/) **(New products and upgrades coming out all the time)**

TLDF:

With several upcoming catalysts mostly this year and down the line to look forward to, and a recent *unjustified selloff*, Bionano makes for an extremely auspicious *long-term* buy at current prices (6s).

4. Saphyr Deep Dive

(How it Works), Advantages, Disadvantages

1. Optical genome mapping using Saphyr® reveals what’s missing in your research. Rapidly identify genome variation like never before with the high-throughput Saphyr system. - [Details](https://bionanogenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Saphyr-Brochure.pdf)

Advantages & A Bit on How it Works

1. The cost of PACB’s method is estimated, based on list pricing, to be between $10,000 and $20,000 per genome. OGM with Saphyr, which costs less than $500 per genome, was shown to be significantly more sensitive than the sequencing method. And much faster. (It should be noted that although the Saphyr can seemingly detect all that NGS & LRS can but at a lower cost, it is not actually the full case. Basically, saphyr can detect certain parts at a higher efficiency but not everything. Most NGS & LRS provide higher-resolution base-level nucleotide information. Saphyr’s map provides a structural map, and does not directly identify the chemistry comprising the structure. Very roughly like if you assay a house, the optical map would be great for showing you the shapes of the foundation, wall and roof framing, but it wouldn't tell you the materials. For similar esoteric information ((intro to ogm & how saphyr works, what it does)) that will help in illuminating the basic process of OGM in action vs. LRS or NGS, these two sources might be good starting places. [#1](https://bionanogenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Saphyr-Brochure.pdf) [#2](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=doctor+dean+youtueb&docid=608026313887146892&mid=0E68F17FBBC6CB9D42B30E68F17FBBC6CB9D42B3&view=detail&FORM=VIRE)).
2. Higher detection rate of large svs than NGS & LRS
3. Cheaper
4. Easier to use and not as esoteric
5. Less false positives
6. Rapidly accumulating evidence indicates that structural variations can comprise millions of nucleotides of heterogeneity within every genome, and are likely to make an important contribution to human diversity and disease susceptibility. - [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_variation)
7. “The system comes with a screen, keyboard, a processor, and a server and costs \~$150 thousand. Besides the system sale and installation revenue, BNGO receives recurring income from consumables like pigments and reagents. Similar to a printer and ink cartilage, this business model creates a regular income stream for BNGO.” - [source](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/), [source](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4410239-bionano-genomics-second-chance)

Disadvantages

1. “BNGO... plans to seek an FDA clearance for Saphyr medical use. The delay is due to the high costs of obtaining the license, stemming from lengthy clinical trials and robust requirements. It is worth reminding that the commercial launch of Saphyr is only recent, and the company has been operating as a publicly traded company for a small number of years. The addressable market of BNGO will increase significantly in the event of an FDA approval.” - [source](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4410239-bionano-genomics-second-chance) (whether this is true or not in the ‘FDA Approval section’)
2. Cannot detect all of what NGS & LRS does
3. Somewhat high cost, although relatively it is cheap when factoring in alternatives because there really are no true alternatives that replicate what the Saphyr does.

For more basic information on how the saphyr works you could watch these [#1](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=doctor+dean+intro+to+BNGO+and+saphyr&docid=608023006763444898&mid=19A3E7A04639BDAA25A119A3E7A04639BDAA25A1&view=detail&FORM=VIRE) [#2](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=doctor+dean+intro+to+BNGO+and+saphyr&docid=608010697387433297&mid=68C7A6CA1AE8D6F8662768C7A6CA1AE8D6F86627&view=detail&FORM=VIRE) [#3](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=doctor+dean+intro+to+BNGO+and+saphyr&docid=607988153116227555&mid=A29766594B704CEEECBBA29766594B704CEEECBB&view=detail&FORM=VIRE).

TLDF:

Saphyr has very auspicious advantages with innovation left to come as built-in obsolescence proponent’s idea in regards to the Saphyr is completely nullified with their ongoing updates and enhancements (I don’t know anyone who doubts the Saphyr in this way, but I’m sure there are some). Recurring revenue with their market strategy is a nice benefit as well and the disadvantages of Saphyr are nothing compared to its current benefits and future innovations.

Saphyr good, bngo good, mapping good, sequencing bad, buy bingo shares

5. FDA Approval

1. Saphyr does not [necessarily need FDA approval](https://www.reddit.com/r/BNGO/comments/lco5kt/the_following_bngo_saphyr_post_is_only_intended/).  

   1. Saphyr is already in *full* use in hospitals, labs, clinics, universities and more.
2. [Pacbio does not have it](https://www.reddit.com/r/BNGO/comments/kvp1dp/the_fda_argument_for_why_ark_wouldnt_invest_in/) and it is one of Ark’s largest holdings.
3. Although FDA approval for the Saphyr may generate more interest and hype for the stock, it likely would not instigate huge moves to the stock price.  

   1. Or as Saphyr gets FDA (if) approval, Ark pulls the trigger, that could happen although personally I think Ark is sophisticated enough to realize that what determines Bionano’s success will not be the FDA approval for a box (Saphyr’s shape resembles a box)

TLDF:

FDA Approval will not make or break the stock, if anything it would boost interest and little else. Bionano can easily do all the things bulls want it to without FDA approval although they would welcome it if it did happen as some institutions may warm up to the Saphyr a bit more in that circumstance.

6. Cancer

I have been saying since before January and February that cancer could be the one thing that makes this stock turn us into millionaires. And although the stock price has gotten beat down, my synthesis for an entire market in cancer solution enhancements/mitigations has only been more legitimized.

Several articles and Bionano themselves alluding to Saphyr being able to ***possibly*** help develop cancer mitigations - cures, chemotherapeutic drug enhancements. A more thorough understanding of how cancer cells replicate and spread so fast provides the *opportunity* to find what stops them. I think the [learning curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve) will play a huge role into Saphyr’s findings in cancer related research especially as they have not been working on cancer research very long.

1. “On April 22, Bionano announced that a group of scientists, using Saphyr and other tools, had developed a technique that is “capable of determining the timing, speed and origin of DNA replication in human cells at a coverage level that is thousands of times higher than what earlier methods such as nanopore sequencing allowed.” Errors in “DNA replication” may result in cancer, “many chemotherapeutic drugs target and disrupt DNA replication,” Bionano stated. As a result, better comprehending DNA replication can aid scientists in developing cancer treatments with reduced side effects, the company believes.” - [source](https://investorplace.com/2021/04/bionanos-uk-deal-is-huge-for-bngo-stock/)
2. “Cancer samples are just too complex for low coverage whole genome sequencing. Complex rearrangements, tumor heterogeneity and unsequenceable repetitive regions of the genome present additional challenges for short and long read sequencing technologies.” [source](https://bionanogenomics.com/research/cancer/#:~:text=Bionano%20Genome%20Imaging%20provides%20cancer%20genomics%20through%20a,genomes%20in%20heterogeneous%20samples%20revealing%20large%20structural%20variations.)
3. “Professor Vanessa Hayes at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research published a complete tumor-normal comparison from a primary prostate cancer.5 Her team identified 85 large somatic deletions and insertions, of which half directly impact potentially oncogenic genes or regions. Only one-tenth of these large SVs were detected using high-coverage short-read NGS and bioinformatics analyses using a combination of the best SV calling algorithms for NGS data. A manual inspection of NGS reads corresponding with the Bionano derived target regions verified 94% of the total SVs called with Bionano mapping. Many SVs detected with Bionano were flanked by repetitive sequences, making them all but invisible to short-read sequencing.” - [source ](https://bionanogenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Bionano-Genomics-Next-Generation-Cytogenetics-Resolves-Structural-Variants-in-Cancer_White-Paper_A.pdf)(page 4)
4. “Bionano Genomics (BNGO) new study is likely to lead to a new level of cancer research and drug discovery with reduced side effects, demonstrating the importance of optical genome mapping (OGM) in a large research market. Notably, the study is led by Dr. Nicholas Rhind from the University of Massachusetts Medical School along with a global team of scientists from France, Canada, and the US. DNA replication is a fundamental process of cell growth seen in cancer and was not easy to study in human genomes. Through Bionano Genomics’ Saphyr-based method, the timing, speed, and origin of DNA replication will be known in human cells at a coverage level, which is thousands of times higher than earlier methods such as nanopore sequencing. The body of humans and other organisms develops and grows when cells divide, and for each division, the entire genome needs to be replicated, the company said. Erroneous DNA replication might result in genome instability and mutations driving cancer. Therefore, as cancer cells divide excessively, many chemotherapeutic drugs target and disrupt DNA replication.” - [source](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bionano-genomics-publishes-new-study-on-dna-replication-shares-gain-in-pre-market-2021-04)

TLDF:

If BNGO discovers new groundbreaking advancements in cancer research then stock price go boom portfolio go brr and bears go hibernate. This seems at least somewhat likely in my mind given all of what they have done so far and considering the learning curve and flywheel effect. Curing cancer is not what we are talking about here, however that may not be out of the range of possibilities down the line, we are emphasizing Saphyr’s proclivity for discovering vital information that could lead to more breakthroughs in mitigating cancer growth and risk. Preventive care, susceptibility, enhancements in chemotherapeutic drugs are all things that Saphyr could certainly help with inventing. If any of this does happen, BNGO GO MOON.

Anyone who bought above 10 is left holding a bag for a while, which is why it's important to make an exit when you met your target, and get back in at the right time.

A historical analysis of the value of gold shows that $GLD LEAPs have the potential for an incredible 80,000% return.**

In this post, I will outline:

1. Why we haven't seen inflation in the past 40 years
2. Why we are going to see inflation now
3. What to do about it

*\*Disclaimer: This post contains only my own opinions. I've strived to be as accurate as possible with the information below, but some information may be inaccurate or outdated. I am not a financial advisor or an investment advisor, and this is not financial advice. Please do your own research before investing your own money.\**

Since the crisis of the 1970's, inflation has been near-absent from developed economies. Almost every financial professional who traded through the 1970's inflationary period is now retired. Since humans always doubt the applicability of times they haven't lived through, society has grown complacent.

**Why we haven't seen inflation in the past 40 years**

Since the 1970's, we have seen two massive deflationary forces:

1. The outsourcing of manufacturing jobs to developing countries, especially China
2. The importation of unskilled labor for agricultural and service sector jobs that couldn't be outsourced.

To understand the incredible deflationary impact these forces have had, imagine a world in which the United States of today manufactures its own goods, and sends back anyone living in the country who is descended from undocumented immigrants (disclaimer: this is not a world I want to see, this is just for the purposes of a thought experiment). Now imagine how much a cheeseburger or an IPhone would cost in that world. It wouldn't be difficult to imagine a $20 McDonald's burger or $8,000 IPhone. Of course, wages would also be much higher in this world, since there would be a much higher demand for US labor.

By visualizing this, you can begin to understand that the impact of our monetary policy over the past 40 years has been *dramatically* inflationary, with this inflationary pressure only being offset by trade and immigration policies that should have lowered the cost of goods and services by 5-10x. This is why, on balance, prices have stayed relatively stable during our lifetimes. In fact, while prices have risen modestly during this time period, the increase in labor supply due to outsourcing and immigration has actually put a massive downwards pressure on the wages of unskilled laborers in the US since 1970:

[US unskilled labor wages actually decreased since 1970](https://preview.redd.it/4z4ieaozdqw61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=45cc63cfaffbdd85a609dc3b6144f7e5bdbf50cd)

**Why we are going to see inflation now**

The problem with the trends outlined above is that the deflationary trends have already reached their near-maximal levels. Concerning immigration, undocumented workers already make up 50%-70% of the agricultural workforce [\[1\]](https://www.fb.org/issues/immigration-reform/agriculture-labor-reform/economic-impact-of-immigration). Foreign-born workers make up 20% of the *entire* low-wage labor force of the US [\[2\]](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/forbrn.pdf):

[Percentage of US workers that are foreign-born, by industry](https://preview.redd.it/brcy6aa79qw61.png?width=1056&format=png&auto=webp&s=af0715c21249f8ba0742542f399d214c7b8a4095)

Concerning manufacturing, the US imports \~$2.1T of manufactured goods each year [\[3\]](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/imports-of-manufactured-goods). In comparison, the US's total GDP from manufacturing is only \~$2.2T [\[4\]](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-from-manufacturing). Taking into account that some of the goods the US manufactures are exported, that means that more than 50% of all manufactured goods for sale in the US were made in other countries.

&#x200B;

[Source: thebalance.com](https://preview.redd.it/dnn8isnkdqw61.png?width=1328&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef710b492bb0cfadb6e09cfd977f3de23f0de7c6)

When we account for the fact that some goods are too expensive to ship overseas, and the fact that the US has recently realized that having some domestic manufacturing capacity is crucial for national defense, the percentage of manufactured goods that the US imports is likely near its maximum sustainable level already.

On top of this, as developing countries industrialize and become wealthier, their labor rates are naturally rising, putting upwards pressure on the price of imported goods:

[Manufacturing labor costs per hour for China, Vietnam, Mexico from 2016 to 2020](https://preview.redd.it/4b6m8bdffqw61.png?width=1558&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aba0db5e2bd43f63527ecd91d6c3c7477c4ab4e)

All of this together means that the United States can no longer mask its inflationary monetary policies with deflationary trade and immigration policies.

Now, enter the pandemic. The massive monetary and fiscal stimulus employed by the US government in 2020 and 2021 greatly increased the number of dollars in circulation, but added nothing to the productive capacity of the United States. The average productivity of a US worker has not grown substantially from 2019 levels. Yet in that time, the S&P 500 has gained 50% in value. A glut of money has flooded the system, leading to the ""everything bubble."" In addition, the US government owes \~$27T, and thus has a *massive* incentive to devalue the US dollar. The only way the government can stay solvent is to continue its inflationary, low interest rate policies.

Inflation is coming.

**What to do about it**

First, understand that while the Fed wants you to believe inflation will be temporary, in actuality, inflation is a self-perpetuating cycle. Investors see that the US dollar is losing purchasing power, so they dump the US dollar in favor of physical assets and foreign currencies. This further devalues the US dollar, causing even more fear amongst investors, leading even more people to dump the US dollar for physical assets and foreign currencies. This is why the Fed worries so much about ""inflation expectations."" As long as no one believes inflation is here (it is), the system won't spiral out of control. Unfortunately, in a free market, you can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can't fool everyone forever.

Now, personally, I do not believe we will see true hyperinflation (defined as prices rising more than 50% month-to-month). Instead, I believe we'll see what I'll call ""runaway inflation."" This is a return to the **\~8-10% yearly inflation rates** we saw during parts of the 1970's.

In such an environment, we should expect to see a few things:

1. Nominal interest rates will rise, but the Fed will strive to keep real rates low or negative
2. P/E compression on stocks
3. Investors will rush to physical assets

By keeping real rates low, the Fed ensures that the US government remains solvent. Stock market P/E ratios will compress, since higher nominal rates will increase the discount rate used to value future cash flows.

Here's a list of some assets ranked by how they would likely perform in such a situation, from worst to best:

1. Bonds (including Treasuries)
2. Stocks
3. Real Estate
4. Gold

For the rest of this section, I will focus on gold for three reasons:

1. It's historically performed the best during inflation.
2. It's a pure inflation play.
3. You can buy call options directly on gold.

**Gold**

Gold increased in value by **14x** during the inflationary 1970's:

[Gold price during the 1970's](https://preview.redd.it/b7wqgc49kqw61.png?width=2334&format=png&auto=webp&s=22947b7178e65a581e47c79fbbb341a8b9c5e1c5)

Adjusted for inflation, this is still an increase of **717%** in a single decade. Since 1980, gold has fallen out of favor with most investors. This pessimism has set the stage for a massive rally in gold prices over the coming decade.

**How to value gold**

The problem with gold is that, since it is not an asset that generates cash flows, it's difficult for people to agree on how to value it.

There are essentially 3 different ways to value gold:

1. As a commodity
2. As an asset class
3. As a currency

In the analysis below, keep in mind that in 1980, one troy ounce of gold was worth **$668**, and it is now worth **$1769**

**Valuing gold as a commodity**

Since 1980, commodity prices have risen by **2.54x**:

[PPI for all commodities](https://preview.redd.it/sirmxwhblqw61.png?width=2324&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2472c79d44d7125edf8805e8d526e482d03077f)

If gold rose by the same percentage, this would imply a current price of **$1696** for gold. This represents a **4% drop** from the current price. We will use this as the floor for gold, as I believe it is unlikely we will see a drop substantially below this price. Keep in mind that, if we expect commodity inflation to average 10% over the next decade, this would still imply a **$4398** price target for gold by 2030

**Valuing gold as an asset class**

Gold is more than just a commodity. It's an established asset class that has been in use for thousands of years. How should we value an asset class? Well, investors tend to allocate a fixed percentage of their portfolio to a given asset class. For example, investors nearing retirement will typically allocate their portfolio 60% to stocks and 40% to bonds, and will rebalance this portfolio when stocks or bonds change in price.

What percentage should we expect investors to allocate to gold if inflation returns in the coming years? In the middle ages, gold and silver represented essentially the entirety of the world's financial assets. In modern times, however, before the removal of the gold standard, gold seems to have constituted about 5% of the value of the world's financial assets. In fact, this was remarkably stable up until 1960:

[Gold as percentage of global financial assets, from 1960-2015](https://preview.redd.it/7iyd80imnqw61.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c7f3453cf4e8a0cc30ac2a77ebcfa630d6cad5b)

We can see that, despite the world coming off the gold standard in 1980, gold remained 2.5% of global financial assets by 1980. After 1980, low inflation rates convinced investors that fiat currency was viable, and pushed gold down to a low of only 0.2% of financial assets during the dot-com bubble.

I believe that, if and when runaway inflation rears its ugly head again, prudent investors will allocate 5%-10% of their portfolio to pure inflation hedges, such as commodities and precious metals. I believe it's reasonable to assume that of this, 2.5% of the portfolio will be allocated to gold, as it was in the 1980's.

If everyone allocated, on average, 2.5% of their portfolio to gold, the price of gold would jump to **\~$8980** today. After 10 years of 10% inflation, gold would reach **\~$23,290** by 2030.

Thus, valuing gold as an asset class, and assuming an allocation percentage that is half of the pre-fiat-currency historical average, we could expect a **1,200%** increase in the price of gold over the next decade.

**Valuing gold as a currency**

The third and final way to think about gold's value is as an alternative currency to the US dollar. Gold has historically been held by central banks as a universal currency, to protect these banks against exchange rate risks. 

In order to value gold as an alternative currency, I will look at how many dollars there were in the past, how many ounces of gold there were in the past, and then assume that there should be a fixed ratio between the total value of all US dollars and the total value of all ounces of gold over time.

There are currently **187,000** metrics tonnes of gold sitting above ground (and only about 57, 000 metric tonnes discovered left to be mined) [\[5\]](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-much-gold-has-been-found-world?qt-news_science_products=0#). Each year, about 1% of this is mined [\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_gold#/media/File:World_Gold_Production_1900-2014.png). Extrapolating backwards, we can estimate that there were **\~75,000** metric tonnes above ground in 1930.

Today, there are **$2.15 trillion** US dollars in circulation. In 1930, there were **$4.4 billion**.

In 1930, there were thus **$59,000** US dollars in existence for every metric ton of gold in existence. Today, there are **$11,497,326** US dollars in existence for every metric ton of gold in existence. Thus, valued as a currency, the price of gold should have risen: 11,497,326 / 59,000 = **194.85 times.**

In 1930, gold was worth $20.69 per troy ounce. Using the ratio derived above, today, gold should be worth: $20.69 \* 194.85 = **$4,031** per ounce. Assuming a 10% inflation rate for the next decade, gold would reach **$10,455** per ounce by 2030.

**Doing better than gold: The beauty of modern finance**

Now that we've seen that gold is potentially massively undervalued by historical standards, the question becomes, how can we maximally profit from this information? After all, we don't just want to preserve purchasing power, we want to actually create wealth. 

Luckily, we have access to something today that medieval peasants did not: call options on gold, priced in nominal dollars.

Since call options are priced in nominal dollars, runaway inflation makes nearly all call options appear desirable. This is especially true of an asset with low implied volatility, such as gold. For the purpose of the rest of this section, I will be examining **$GLD**, the world's largest physically-backed gold ETF.

I've chosen gold and **$GLD** rather than silver and **$SLV** for two reasons:

1. $GLD options have much lower IV than $SLV options, at \~16% versus \~32%. Thus, with $SLV you're paying roughly twice as much for your inflation bet.
2. $GLD is backed by physical gold

To figure out what we could expect to make from $GLD LEAPs, let's summarize the results of our three ways to value gold analyzed above, assuming additionally a 10% annual inflation rate for the next two years and using that assumption to predict Jan 2023 $GLD prices:

&#x200B;

* Priced as a commodity:
   * May 2021 predicted value: $1696 / oz
   * Jan 2023 predicted value: $1987 / oz
   * Jan 2023 predicted $GLD price: **$186**
* Priced as an asset class:
   * May 2021 predicted value: $8980 / oz
   * Jan 2023 predicted value: $10,524 / oz
   * Jan 2023 predicted $GLD price: **$986**
* Priced as a currency:
   * May 2021 predicted value: $4,031
   * Jan 2023 predicted value: $4,724
   * Jan 2023 predicted $GLD price: **$442**

&#x200B;

Using an options profit calculator [\[7\]](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/option-finder.html), we can then determine which Jan 2023 options would be most profitable in each scenario:

&#x200B;

* Priced as a commodity:
   * Most profitable option: **Jan 2023 $150.00 Call**
   * Expected nominal return: 56.7%
   * Expected real return: **39.5%**
* Priced as an asset class:
   * Most profitable option: **Jan 2023 $350.00 Call**
   * Expected nominal return: 82,497.4%
   * Expected real return: **82,480.2%**
* Priced as a currency:
   * Most profitable option: **Jan 2023 $320.00 Call**
   * Expected nominal return: 12,608.3%
   * Expected real return: **12,591.1%**

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

It's possible to not only survive runaway inflation, but to profit massively. If gold ends up being valued the way it was historically, as an asset class or a currency, there's a potential for a **100-800x** return through $GLD options. Even valuing gold as a commodity, $GLD options have good potential upside. Thanks for listening WSB ✌️

That said, your argument of people only acting on experiences they personally lived through makes sense and I'd also wager that they are more likely to risk high inflation than a second 2008.

2021-05-02 20:00:36,wallstreetbets,"Apparently some people have implemented neural networks in SQL.  Not very practical though. Incidentally, most machine learning libraries are written in C or C++ which originated in the 70's and 80's respectively.  Most data scientists use API's for these frameworks made for newer, easier to use languages like python, R or lua, which originated in the early 90s to early 2000's.  If they chose to write in C or C++, it would probably be more optimized though... not enough to matter of course, as all of the heavy lifting is done in the natively compiled language.  Of course this is an oversimplification because these languages have been continuously updated since their release.. and I am not mentioning CUDA, just kinda lumping that in with C and C++ and it can be considered as a superset of the latter.

Now if we are talking about Artificial General Intelligence.. or ""true AI"", thats a completely different story--as it has not currently been achieved. And I believe the most optimal way of going about that would have less to do with programming languages and more to do with computer architecture. Computers are deterministic systems,  so they can be used to model probabilistic systems like AI, but perhaps a better model would not use the Von Neumann Architecture.  Personally, I think an analog circuit might be better suited to the task.. as it would be orders of magnitude faster and would not require high levels of precision because it does not need to be deterministic.   Of course this would also be applicable to many broader machine learning problems as well imo.  But I think the only way you could model a brain, for instance, without taking up an entire floor of a building in server space.. would be to go that route. But don't let this man distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table."

People think gold is worth something because we learn in history that it used to be worth something. There are plenty of metals/materials that are far more useful than gold, and they aren't worth thousands of dollars an ounce. If the economy tanks, gold isn't going to be the fall back you hope for, because society has changed IMMEASURABLY since the gold standard. Bitcoin would absolutely go up in value, precisely BECAUSE it is finite and buffers against inflation. And since it can be used anywhere internationally to purchase items, it is far more useful than lugging around physical gold. Bitcoin has trended up over the years, and within the last two or three has finally been accepted as viable currency outside of the dark markets. It's not going anywhere at this point.

If NGDP growth has run at, on average, 4 to 5% per annum since 20210 and inflation had averaged 8-10%, then RGDP must have averaged somewhere between -5 to -7% every year.

>money in circulation isn't consistent with the real economy anymore

The quantity of money is supplied based on money demand, which is the inverse of money velocity [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V). If there had not been ample money in the economy, interest rates would've shot up, NGDP would have collapsed further. NGDP is total spending in the economy -> less loans issued and at higher real rates, people would not have been able to pay back older loans issued under higher inflation expectations, much higher unemployment due to no wage growth since wages are sticky downwards, etc.

TLDR: If there hadn't been plenty of money in the economy, it would have been an economic catastrophe on the scale of the great depression, which was also caused and prolonged by a collapse of the money supply."

Also yes, I've made a similar point in another comment. The fed can fuck up in 2 ways: either too much supply or too little supply and you would bet on either of those 2 using opposite strategies. The theory here is that they will learn towards too much supply in fear of another 2008, but that's not a good enough chance to yolo for me.

2 years ago I would've predicted that they'll just pull a japan and put capitalism on infinite life support. However now that Covid happened the example you made essentially happened on a smaller scale: markets went up while the real economy tanked, which smells like inflation. The question is whether it'll be cushioned in time

EDIT: also if i'm not wrong velocity of money is somewhat proportional to investment. Low investment -> low velocity of money -> high demand for cash, which should predict an inflationary period. However that's a bit of a ""the sun is shining right now but I'm sure it will rain in the future"" type of statement."

Granted, he did not specify a number he thought was ""correct"", I'm going by what he seemed to agree with in the comments. He seems to not understand that PCE/CPI are calculated based on averages.

>2 years ago I would've predicted that they'll just pull a japan and put capitalism on infinite life support. However now that Covid happened the example you made essentially happened on a smaller scale: markets went up while the real economy tanked, which smells like inflation.

That's not what inflation is. Asset prices do not have anything to do with inflation, which measures consumer prices. Japan didn't put capitalism on life support, capitalism has nothing to do with QE. Japan just did not want to see indefinite falling wages + mass unemployment, which I think is a pretty good case for aggressive monetary policy.

>The question is whether it'll be cushioned in time

For what?

>also if i'm not wrong velocity of money is somewhat proportional to investment. Low investment -> low velocity of money -> high demand for cash

No, velocity is NGDP/M, directly related to all of nominal spending/output and the money supply. The demand for cash is the inverse quantity (if people aren't spending their cash then by definition demand for money goes up).

>which should predict an inflationary period

Higher demand for money is disinflationary, that's why the Fed has been saying deflationary forces are stronger than inflationary forces (not withstanding supply issues, which they can't fix)."
2021-05-03 12:49:16,wallstreetbets,">Japan didn't put capitalism on life support, capitalism has nothing to do with QE.

You make some good points, but current valuations do seem to be dependent on QE. After the taper tantrum in 2013 the Fed restarted bond purchases.

And unless the US is about to undergo Japanification, they will have to taper at some point. Economists have already suggested that the Fed may end up tapering this year instead of 2022 due to rising inflation."

Basically BTX was heavily shorted and the share value and low float forced BTX to hyper bounce. As it Hyperbounced, People caught some wind and  did the same play I did. Buy it up ride the spikes enjoy the wins. I called this thing at 5.15 and watched it so closely that I could almost predict when the spike was coming. That being said The short volume ratio is into no mans land.

Again im just a retard who is new here, I do my own work and expect nothing else. Sharing my findings and thought.

I didn't know that it would garner that much of positive feedbacks and I'm excited to write my TA posts as a series if time allows me to.

With that being said, I do not plan to write these kind of posts for every trading session days since I would run out of things to say at one point. My intention is to write these kind of posts for days where we see a significant gap-up or gap-down that reinforces the Elliott Wave Theory speculation. I also want to remind you that if the closing price goes below the speculated ""bottom"", the entire theory will be invalidated. I hope you all join me in this bumpy ride and enjoy it together. Anyways, let's get right to what I think about Friday's (4/30/21) price action.

# Brief Summary:

As of 4/30/21, CLOV opened at $9.89 and closed at $9.85 with a previous closing price of $10.17 (-3.15%). To simply put it, today was a consolidation day based on the opening price and the closing price. The volume didn't help with the stock's bullish sentiment either as Friday's volume was at 17.38 mil in contrast to Thursday's volume at 68.33 mil. This means Friday's volume was cut down by more than -74.5%; that's 3/4 of Thursday's total volume, gone for today. Now, I have a few speculations as to why we experienced one of the lowest volumes on Friday ever since the CLOV hype began:

* Continual market beatdown against smaller market caps causing a FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) against retail investors which discouraged investors from purchasing stocks due to the fear of further market beatdown.
* CLOV's chart on Friday EXACTLY mirrored the NASDAQ 100 chart and NASDAQ's relative volume was the LOWEST out of all three major stock market indices (DOW, NASDAQ, and S&P 500). Don't believe it? Check out the images below.
   * Based on the images below, it's clear to me that there is a positive correlation to the performance of market index versus CLOV (individual stock) on Friday. This leads to a reasonable assumption that CLOV had a disappointing day NOT because of CLOV's getting ""dumped on"" per se, but rather because the entire market (especially NASDAQ) performed poorly on Friday.

**Fibonacci retracements:**

With Friday's bearish price action, it's good to see that we've respected the 23.6% level as a major support rather than letting it become the new resistance level. However, Friday's price action doesn't **necessarily** indicate that Thursday's (4/29/21) price action was a bear trap. Depending on the next Monday's overall market performance, volume level, and buying pressure, I think we will be able to get a clearer picture as to whether we are going to use 23.6% level as a support to bounce off from or continue the downward trend. Overall, I do think that we will see 23.6% level being used as a support for CLOV to bounce off on as long as the overall market shows a reversal pattern on Monday.

**Elliott Wave Theory:**

Friday's price action, although it was a minimal dip in the grand scheme of things, does confirm that we are in wave 2 which is a corrective wave. I originally speculated that we will see a healthy pullback to around $8.52 range but since the chart respected the 23.6% level as a support, we may see a bounce earlier and perhaps move on to wave 3. That's a very good thing for all of us who want to see CLOV explode off to Mars. But, of course, this is all contingent upon high volume level and high buying pressure. We will have to continue to observe the price action and the daily chart to find further confirmations that indicate to wave 3 speculation.

**VWAP:**

Today, I wanted to focus more on the VWAP which is an acronym for 'volume weighted average price'. Simply put, it's a metric used for intraday charts to determine the buying pressure and selling pressure based on that day's volume and share price. The rule of this metric is: **If the candle sticks are above the VWAP line, it's a bullish sentiment and vice versa.**

Based on that rule, we can now look at the 5 min chart and see what's going on with the VWAP line which is colored blue. Looking at the chart, we can see that during the market opening, we stayed **above** the VWAP line with a great start to the volume level. This means that the buying pressure was greater than the selling pressure based on the volume. However, as the trading session went on, the explanation provided from the brief summary section caused the volume level to dry up and die off. And as the volume level went down, you can see how the candle sticks moved **below** the VWAP line which means that the selling pressure was greater than the buying pressure.

**RSI:**

This is further reinforced by looking at Friday's RSI chart. You can see that during the market opening, RSI trended towards an overbought territory, but as volume level died off RSI eventually corrected itself down to a neutral level, consolidated a bit, and headed over to an oversold level which is correlated to the 5 min price chart above. Based on VWAP and RSI analysis, it is reasonable to assume that CLOV will show a reversal as long as the volume level is high.

**Short Volume:**

Let's take a look at CLOV's short volume as a bonus since people believe there's a potential for short squeeze. According to a quick Google search, it is widely accepted as a fact that 10% short interest ratio is considered 'high' while 20% short interest ratio is considered 'extremely high'. Now take a look at all three of the short volume data on popular stocks like AMC, GME, and then CLOV. And now, take a look at CLOV's stock price history chart with its volume for each trading session days, what do you see?

It's clear to me as day that shorts are shorting in PROPORTION to the amount of volume level for each trading session day. Whether that day's volume level is extremely high or not, they are shorting CLOV with an average shorting ratio percentage of 23.1% which is considered EXTREMELY HIGH from 4/19 to 4/30. To further add, we can see that short volume ratio is pretty much similar across all three stocks. Based on that analysis, I will let you be the judge on whether we have a potential for short squeeze or not.

&#x200B;

# Conclusion:

In conclusion, CLOV's share price did NOT necessarily drop on Friday because people are ""dumping"" their shares. We rather saw a slight drop in CLOV's share price on Friday because of market's poor overall performance that led to an extremely low volume level. This led to shorts having a field day by shorting the stock even more as the short volume ratio is consistently at around 20%. **But,** we shouldn't invest in the stock based on the short squeeze potential alone. We should invest in the stock because we believe in the company and the company's management.

That being said, with 2 days of bearish days for the overall market, I hope to see a green day for the market on Monday and see CLOV bounce off from the $9.66 support. Thank you for reading and I look forward to throwing a champagne party with you all once we are at the moon!

**Tl;dr:** **Today's low volume can be explained by the overall market performance, so don't worry too much about the price action today. BUY and HODL and watch this four petal leaf company go off to the moon with me.**

**Disclaimer:** This is not a financial advice. I'm simply a fellow ape who just likes the company. Invest at your own risk and most importantly, do your own personal due diligence to ensure that the facts are true.

2021-05-03 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLOV - Some Option Information Here’s something interesting to consider from a more technical options standpoint: right now there is unusually high open interest in CLOV calls (a significant portion being out of the money). These calls are often written by market makers, who need to hedge their short calls by purchasing stock. As you know, gamma squeezes occur as the stock rises and more of these call options go in the money and the whales buy up stock to hedge their risk. Here is another part of the puzzle many people are missing: the amount of stock they buy to hedge is often related to the delta of the option (so they can remain delta neutral). Hence, the higher the delta of a contract, the more shares the market maker needs to buy in order to hedge the risk. Here’s another fact: vanna (the second order Greek, measuring delta sensitivity with respect to implied volatility) is (typically) positive. This means that if implied volatility goes up, delta will go up, and market makers will have to purchase more shares to remain market neutral. Now here’s the kicker: as earnings approach, implied volatility will usually, particularly in shorter term contracts, skyrocket. Couple this with the fact that the May 21 expiration is very close to earnings, deltas across the board will quite possibly rise substantially in the days before earnings, forcing market makers to buy up huge chunks of stock to hedge, and hence potentially driving up the price by a tremendous deal.

This is all speculation. I cannot stress enough that there is no guarantee that this is the case. This theory could fail for a number of reasons: these calls may simply be retail investors who aren’t bound by any delta neutral strategies or anything of the sort; the stock may drop before earnings and hence the increase in implied volatility could fail to offset the change in underlying's effect on delta; the market makers simply buy the calls back at a premium from paper-handed option buyers, taking a loss; or there is sufficient downward pressure/selling momentum at the time that the market makers could simply buy a lot of stock without drastically increasing the price. That's why I need to say: please please please only invest if you genuinely believe in the stock and can afford to lose whatever you put in. The stock market is risky business - nothing is guaranteed and you can always lose a lot of money if you make poor decisions. In fact, you can lose a lot of money even if you make really good decisions and the market turns against you.

(This is not financial advice - please do your own due diligence and only risk capital you can actually afford to lose. I myself have invested about 10k in LEAPs, short term options, and then another few thousand in shares.)"

If you buy the shares an hold them, you really won't ever have to sell them at a loss, you will only make money on them. The only risk is how long you will have to hold them for it to be profitable, which seems pretty low at a 5% return and price being much lower that the consensus price target. This is good for long term account, as for trading it for a quick buck or massive loss, there are probably better options for you to gamble if that's your forte. Like whatever will be the next great wsb pump and dump, lol."

2021-05-02 21:48:26,wallstreetbets,"Well that's because apes are too busy hyping shit stocks & then wondering why they are stuck holding bags of shit after they crash. 

I have researched UWMC all weekend & it's a solid company. Much more so than RKT. But Apes are now too busy buying CLOV. Yet another shit company."
2021-05-03 05:16:48,wallstreetbets,"It's doesn't have to move to pay you. Do you realize that it is at a 5% return when it is $8 a share? Let me simplify, 2 million dollars in UWMC at $8 a share is 100k a year in dividends alone. That's not even counting doubling or tripling it through selling premium. Guaranteed 5% + whatever premium to sell."

2021-05-03 07:05:35,wallstreetbets,"yup, though i don’t see it “popping” but rather stopping its ridiculous growth rate. i just can’t imagine there ever being more supply than demand so that prices can actually go down (with few exceptions, of course)"

2021-05-03 01:32:45,wallstreetbets,"The issue is the stock is oversold. I'm not saying that it *will* go up, but I've invested under the thesis that it's more likely to go up than down."
2021-05-03 05:00:41,wallstreetbets,"If it plummets, I get to buy more at even higher return! 5% return with an options chain, there is no other stock like that under $10. The last one I found like that was MAC last year."
2021-05-03 09:04:38,wallstreetbets,Amd also isn’t a 8 dollar stock that’ has just continuously been sold of since its spac merge. We all know how every spac has gone this year. Uwmc has been the biggest company to spac in record and at that being already profitable while doing so.
2021-05-02 21:51:01,wallstreetbets,"No clue where you’re at but in many of the places we do business markets are absolutely absurd.  Thought we might be seeing a bubble w talk of ltcg going up, rates still low, I see a lot of “forever” money going into RE and over the next few quarters.  I’m beefing up on a bunch of RE tickers including mortgage companies, material companies, construction companies etc...  vici lennar all the lumber companies... all ripping

TLDR: you’re tarded"
2021-05-03 10:14:53,wallstreetbets,"True, I don’t think price will fall down past their actual value - I just think they’ll be a correction within the year though."

Here we are."
2021-05-03 12:32:40,wallstreetbets,Hope you sold already
2021-05-02 20:48:40,wallstreetbets,Well somebody in every trade had to hold a bag. It's a zero sum game.
2021-05-02 23:45:43,wallstreetbets,"Vega is stronger for further dated option, I agree. 

IV on further dated options is less impacted by short term events like earnings run ups."
2021-05-03 07:00:30,wallstreetbets,"My original DD was wrong, It may be a good stock, but I got taken in by some accounts on here that appeared to be bots (only posted about UWMC and then disappeared shortly afterwards) so it didn’t seem worth doubling down on that. I moved my money elsewhere and made my loss back."
2021-05-03 02:11:21,wallstreetbets,There's where you went astray
2021-05-03 17:44:31,wallstreetbets,"Prices don't matter for UWMC's business.  What matters is volume.  And there's very little inventory on the market, which hurts volume."
2021-05-02 20:52:19,wallstreetbets,"> The united States is currently short about 4 million homes in terms of supply/demand

happy cakeday.

yes, that was exactly my point. **no one selling** = **shitty market**. i now see how my wording choice was poor.

in sum, there's extremely low supply, which has led to increased prices. once supply opens up, presumably this summer, things will *actually* be crazy. folks betting (short term) on uwmc will be better served waiting one quarter."
2021-05-02 20:47:28,wallstreetbets,"yeh, i worded the refinance part weirdly. you're right, buyers seem wary of even going for jumbo loans because of delays associated with the increased business lenders are getting with refinances (sellers rather take lower all-cash offers if they meet the insanely short contingency removal periods). but, it turns out that ""word on the street"" has been different than reality. yes, there's an increase in refinances, but is not ""through the roof"".

also, the point that i was trying to drive home is that, with the low volume due to everything surrounding the pandemic, and the increase in prices as a result, once the market actually opens (presumably this summer) we should see a spike like ""never"" before.

some of it will be ""priced in"", but if folks are betting on uwmc, there's a significantly greater chance of unprecedented price action next quarter than the current one."
2021-05-02 21:09:41,wallstreetbets,If he averaged 8.50... literally the same amount
2021-05-02 23:26:13,wallstreetbets,Right so the game is just beating the timing.

2021-05-02 22:05:28,wallstreetbets,"Ah, gotcha. Yea, I get cold called about twice a week by realtors with folks ready to overpay. I'm pretty confident this market will be popping soon....I've practically begged my wife to sell and grab an apartment to wait for the crash lol. No luck and I'm figuring we are nearly out of time."
2021-05-02 21:19:55,wallstreetbets,"What are you basing your assumption that ‘word on the street’ is different in meeting criteria of ‘through the roof’ lol? RKT/Quicken and UWMC are busier than they have ever been. With actual buyers/refinance borrowers.

I am absolutely positive there will not be a wave of properties on the open market later this summer with a drop in pricing and values.

To elaborate on that, when it comes to $UWMC, more properties on the market, and more buyers, is nothing but great news for them."
2021-05-02 22:23:05,wallstreetbets,Got em.
2021-05-03 00:01:40,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-02 21:54:57,wallstreetbets,"I don’t invest in the industry outside of owning and renting properties, not interested in investing into builders."
2021-05-02 21:35:21,wallstreetbets,"i'm not sure how you see my statements as contradictory of your own.

1) currently there are fewer buyers, more refinancers than usual, and more clients overall. not to the point of word on the street which is, ""lenders have so much refinance business than they're passing on financing buyers, or jumbo loans are taking 45 days to be issued"".

2) there will be a wave of properties on the open market this summer **with a further increase in pricing and values** (not sure how you got the other interpretation).

in short, $UWMC will print mad tendies towards Q2 ER due to the great news you mention. emphasis on mad, that is, next week will be tamed by comparison—this is not to say that the stock will go down."
2021-05-02 22:18:11,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm...  less supply available and you don’t want to invest in the plug who has the only supply.  Builders have been seeing record margins on projects started 6-24 months ago because of supply shortage WHICH YOU SAID that’s driven prices up on homes they built at last year costs.  Oh, and my lennar stock doesn’t call at 3 am with a leak or broken AC or need a roof.  You must hate tendies

PS - I own plenty of real estate"
2021-05-02 22:37:49,wallstreetbets,"I never said that investing in builders wasn’t a good idea, I never said that they weren’t seeing record margins and I never said anything about the convince of stock vs direct ownership, all I said in regards to any of that is that I am personally not interested in investing into builders, because I put my time into other sectors and other businesses. There is nothing wrong with that, just as there is nothing wrong with wanted to invest into the construction industry. 

No idea what you’re going on about."

2021-05-02 20:56:24,wallstreetbets,"No, you’re just stupid. Gains posts are sufficient to tell you that it’s too late/a bad play, but they are not necessary to show something is a bad play. 

Any other information you would like spoon fed to you?"
2021-05-02 20:58:07,wallstreetbets,"No we won’t. My point wasn’t that CLOV is a bad play, my point was OP made a shitty argument for it being a bad play.

God damn apes b dumb

I didn’t delete anything, and if you think this is me being angry you might have FASD.
you so upset that you creeped my comment history? (Rhetorical, I don’t care actually care)

2021-05-02 21:34:45,wallstreetbets,Hey buddy see that comment I didn’t delete?
2021-05-02 21:15:26,wallstreetbets,"If you can still see it....why do you think I deleted it? Idiot🤦🏻‍♂️. I went back and mentioned you in it just to make you feel better 

I didn’t say anything about short sellers, now you’re getting me confused with other people. 

You shouldn’t get so emotionally invested that you creep my comments and try and continue your argument in another thread? You’re triggered lol"
2021-05-02 21:01:21,wallstreetbets,"So you said that if we see gains posts it’s over, even though you had not seen any. And you did this so we would understand that it would not start, even though these things are not necessarily related. And yet it is the people reading your posts who are stupid. Is that right?"
2021-05-02 21:18:53,wallstreetbets,"Literally just clicked the comment you deleted buddy, it comes up in the notifications but shows it's deleted.... Exit your reddit tab, and put on some relaxing music. It's not healthy, man. Don't get so upset."
2021-05-02 21:13:04,wallstreetbets,"No....that is not right. 
You’re very bad at reading comprehension, and before you blame me for not making what I said simple enough for you to understand: your lack of comprehension is a you problem"

2021-05-02 21:53:55,wallstreetbets,"No. You randomly for no reason talked about gain posts, and there were no gain posts, and the you started talking trash for no reason and about unrelated things.

2021-05-03 13:57:46,wallstreetbets,"Go through my comments and you’ll find that I was worried about the same thing. If the squeeze happens you’ll have time.
Also if you did your research you’d find that shares were being sold in margin accounts. 

It seems like your husband was able to afford some shares too, why couldn’t you guys buy shares with a different broker and then just sell out of RH once you secured the shares somewhere else? Or even do it in increments? All this seems like a you problem. You had months to do something about it. I literally felt EXACTLY the same way as you and managed to get it done so quit acting like a victim when you did this to yourself"

2021-05-02 22:59:22,wallstreetbets,"Which is the same reason why I’m perplexed with all the people expecting some insane $400/share short squeeze on CLOV. We’ve seen it with GME already, if the stock makes a run super fast, trading will be halted, and in the long term the price is artificially suppressed. GME was dope and all but the most important thing is to remember what we learned about how brokerages and hedge funds handle this kind of thing"
2021-05-03 08:23:34,wallstreetbets,"Some of us bought on RH BEFORE they did the AH move of restricting buying. Yes, my 43 shares are still there. But only because Fidelity’s transfer wouldn’t work, after 6 tries I gave up. I’m not on margin with RH, cash only. So, I have nothing for them to close my positions out for. Via email they have said they will not close positions unless it’s a margin account that falls below the maintenance amount, which does not apply to me. I’m good. Nonetheless, assholes here have bullied me about it to the point I’m going to sell my 43 shares tomorrow and put it all into ETH. At least I don’t get beat up, bullied and called names for where I buy & store my ETH from that community. Thanks WSB for being absolute dicks & assholes to a newbie. Much appreciated at this fragile time in my life. Fuckers! I hate peoples, you all suck."

Its important to look at earnings and then weeks before and weeks after. It usually is important to see price levels a few days before and a few days after for price movement to the down or upside.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|disapproval)

I think we all agree that valuations are a little crazy right now, we're seeing the same thing in the housing market, but if inflation concerns are the driving factor, doesn't that go against your underlying thesis? Also, what is to stop the government from simply printing more money if the big bad recession comes knocking?

Many suppliers can't even make enough to meet demand and we are starting to see unknown eta back orders for things as simple as studs or exhaust gaskets.  Things no one would ever imagine a shortage of because of its frequency and commonality.  They're always needed but now there's a national shortage.  We've resorted to pulling from inventory from other countries to get by and some times those parts availability are in single digits. 

Everyone speculates it's from the Covid slowdown but the reality is that logistics never stopped during the pandemic.  So with the demand remaining constant why did the supply dry up the closer we are to getting through this pandemic?  

I don't mean to sound doom and gloom but pay attention to the shortages nearest you and realize it may lead to inflation as OP suggested...  Just look at New gen console chip shortages and GPU unavailavility. What else in your field have you begun to notice isn't as available as you remember?"

2021-05-03 03:16:35,wallstreetbets,"Assuming random odds yes you’re right. However, a quick look at some comparison charts show not only patterned movements but strategized movements as well.

If it spins 49/50 times red, I’m betting red on 50. It’s most likely being manipulated to be red. Although it could just as well be manipulated to be black, or not manipulated at all on 50. But again, bet red.

To add to that, historical data is often used as a reference for future strategies. If a stock has a historically 100% chance to close higher at the end of a month than it opened at the beginning of that month, you can consider it a safer than not bet to long it that month. If the stock goes up 30% average in that month for the past 20 years, you can feel safe looking for 30% profit up from open that month. Is it certain? No. Of course you won’t win them all. But you can certainly improve your success rate by breaking down technicals. And that additional success rate can make a big difference over time."

Answer they admittedly lied to you.

Why is it if someone died within 2 weeks of having covid, it's a covid death no questions asked.  But when someone dies right after the vaccine, they will blame it on everything except the vaccine.

Why does nobody ask these questions?

Show me the average death rate from all causes, and then the average death rate of all thise who received a vaccine.  Where is that data?

I thought this is science based?  Don't you people believe in science?"

Otherwise, mortgage defaults, auto defaults, pensions/401ks wiped out entirely, state run programs (healthcare, education, roads) broken, etc.   
Pretty much everyone but the 1or 2 % would be wiped out if governments didn't step up."

- You're asking what happens to the money gained from selling stocks- where does it go?

- He's saying it doesn't matter, because the seller's money exiting the market is counter-balanced by the buyer's money entering the market. Which means that before the buyer bought the seller's stock, the money was SOMEWHERE.

- Presumably, he also implies that the real question is where was the buyer's money stored beforehand since it wasn't in stocks? And that when the seller sells their stock, the seller's money will go the the same place."

If you're looking at volume and relative strength index, those are some pretty standard things to look at if you are actively trading. But that's about it in my book. People get wrapped up with finding patterns like head and shoulders and cup and handle all while forgetting that past performance of a stock does not have any bearing on the future. 

If you're looking at long term investing, then look at the fundamentals. What growth opportunities does it have? How is the company's balance sheet? Are they profitable/do they have revenue growth?"

2021-05-02 21:23:28,wallstreetbets,There are many definitions that have been argued over for years. I could understand getting hung up on the semantics of what constitutes a bubble but the greater point I’m making is real estate is the not the underlying or even highest risk asset right now in this inflated economy we are seeing. I’m not trying to advocate for those taking advantage but to suggest that’s the major or only factor seems naive to me.
2021-05-02 22:13:30,wallstreetbets,"The only reason they aren't underwater is that there's been foreclosure moratoriums and mortgage forebearance - in a ""normal"" housing market where people who stop paying their mortgage get kicked out of their houses, we'd have had 8-10+ million houses on the market instead of 8-10 million houses in forebearance and the biggest crash in decades already.     The fact that rich business owners were given \~$16trillion of free money (much of which got dumped into real estate) also helped."

2021-05-03 07:00:11,wallstreetbets,"Correct on Bullets 1 and 2.

There are two sides to every trade. Selling volume does not exceed buying volume, they match each other. Shares sold and shared bought must be equal. Cash credited to seller accounts is also matched by cash debited from buyer accounts. When you look at BOTH sides of the trade, there is no 'new cash' that we need to worry about 're-deploying'. This is true regardless of price changes (up, down, unchanged). Every day, people are buying and selling. Prices are moving up and down. In the event of a market crash, these principles still apply. A rapid drop in prices does NOT result in 'new cash' showing up in investor accounts. The only thing that changed was stock prices, which affect investor's 'account values', but not their overall cash balances.

Bullet 3 - It's not relevant to the crash scenario.

Price is simply the mechanism to bring selling and buying into equilibrium, since they must match. A change in circumstances/sentiment can cause investors to be less interested in buying and more interested in selling. The price shifts down to bring them back into balance.

I've lived through several major market crashes over the past 23 years of investing. I don't recall investors being flush with cash in any of them."

2021-05-02 21:46:56,wallstreetbets,"I don't think anyone is implying it's the only threat right now, just that this is the most imminent and emerging based on the overwhelmingly obvious signs all around us.

This is a bubble, and we know it's going to burst. Everything about it is artificial and we're receiving every warning sign that hindsight illuminated back in 2009 after everything went to shit. Add to that the fact that the commercial real estate market is going to see a nosedive so fast it'll look like a WWII bombing run.

What we don't know is if the rest of the market will go before housing--or at all. Almost everything we're seeing right now is indicating that we're going to, at the very least, see a boom this year and probably well into the next. Depending on how people manage the housing market crash will determine if that boom will bust as well."
2021-05-02 23:14:55,wallstreetbets,"Yeah no, that’s not how this works. Even if someone can’t pay their mortgage today, their home is worth much more, on average, than they still owe on it. That’s literally the opposite of being underwater. They would sell that home for profit at high value, not have it foreclosed on."
2021-05-02 23:15:41,wallstreetbets,Homes won’t foreclose because the value of those homes is higher than what the owners owe. That’s the opposite of being underwater.
2021-05-02 20:20:41,wallstreetbets,"Well, it's blatantly obvious that the Rona came out of Wuhan lab, but they've lied, misdirected and impeded efforts to prove it to such an extent that they've gotten away with it. They marched into Hong Kong, and nobody lifted a finger. They're taking over the South China Sea, and nobody is doing anything about it. Next will be Taiwan, and I'm beginning to doubt that anything will happen then, either. Think it'll be any different if they decide to sink Bitcoin? Most governments hate crypto. Who's going to put up a fight over it if the CCP wrecks it? Probably none. Can they force global acceptance of the e-yuan? Of course they can. How many international corporations will balk if that's what they have to use it in order to do business in China? None. They'll complain quietly, but they'll certainly sell-out in a heartbeat.  


China holds a tremendous amount of leverage over the world in so many ways, and all we do is complain about it. ""U.S. is mad at us? Okay, then no more antibiotics coming your way. Let us know when you're tired of dropping like flies."" They can cut off the supply of rare metals for batteries and watch the world's renewable energy sector wither and die. I don't put anything past them."

2021-05-02 23:11:34,wallstreetbets,"To my other comments, I don’t think housing is at the top of the list as far as dominoes to fall. Bonds, SPACS, CLO’s, commercial, etc 

The available inventory has literally been cut in half in the past year with like a 12% appreciation YTD across the board. S&P also near 12% YTD. 

I’m well aware there are a lot of people behind on their mortgage that we haven’t seen the affects of because of the moratoriums but those are also a misrepresentation on both sides. I wouldn’t be surprised if it shouldn’t be more but on the other hand if you aren’t forced to pay right now why would you throw away that liquidity if you didn’t have to? But the vast majority of new purchases that occurred this year are financially healthy debts. 

I’m not trying to dismiss these issues but personally I see a lot more red flags in different sectors and think “the overwhelmingly obvious signs all around” are misunderstood in relation to the housing market. This is nothing like 2009’. We did not have anywhere near the current supply demand ratios, the beyond leveraged delinquent mortgages, homes being built for no one and ghost towns (builders are only taking on 2-3 projects max right now for those same fears and don’t want to be over extended left holding the bag). 

There are a plethora of very serious economic issues going on right now and an inequality gap exponentiating more than we’ve ever seen, I just have more reasons to believe there are bigger underlying issues than the real estate market."
2021-05-03 08:31:28,wallstreetbets,"The crash last time wasn't because of interest rates or subprime borrowers, remember interest only? All that's needed is a warm body to sign off on another loan as the values increase. That's not going to happen this time with so much hidden unemployment. Subprime and those unable to pay are just the first to jump ship due to necessity, not the cause."
2021-05-02 20:55:46,wallstreetbets,"In the case of a 51% attack, they would essentially be blocking people from access to large amounts of wealth. You can't really steal it, only block access. And the tools you need in order to continue blocking access are computers that are connected to the internet. It doesn't take a government to fight that, just smart people with lots of incentive. 

Maybe they can force people to accept e-yuan, but killing Bitcoin would be counterproductive to that end, because it would make people more suspicious of digital currency in general as well as China in particular."
2021-05-02 22:05:39,wallstreetbets,The reason I say that is because that’s a brand new program where before this if you earn the $300 you would lose your $300. Not to mention that you have all the free time you want to to be able to work on a project build a home whatever you wanted. It makes no sense that someone who originally made $11 an hour gets to make more to sit at home and do whatever they want.
2021-05-02 22:10:47,wallstreetbets,"And also why should someone be able to earn $600 per week and do absolutely nothing. Should companies pay $600 a week and someone do absolutely nothing? Also three out of five new start up restaurants fail in the first two years I personally have known two restaurant owners who worked their butts off invested money but after labor which was about 1/3 food cost which was about another third and then paying commercial rent etc. they actually wouldn’t make very much money. In fact so little they eventually close down. They are the lifeblood of the economy someone who has a dream and works 70 hours a week hoping someday they can make $100,000 a year. But often dreams fail. Maybe corporations can  afford to pay $20 an hour but if you start paying dishwashers and high school kids who live with their parents so they can have an extra $3200 a month spending money then people will just stop even trying to open up a restaurant and all will have left is McDonald’s And Domino’s. All they will do is raise the price of pizzas and hamburgers and not one person in the United States will be able to compete because they’re already so cheap anyway"

2021-05-03 15:50:32,wallstreetbets,lol Acquisition companies.
2021-05-03 03:48:20,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for mentioning RocketLabs as the exception, because they are. They will be the premier orbital payload company.

Space X on the other hand, are so far ahead of the competition that they are eyeing Mars when everyone else is eyeing orbit. Why would you want to compete with that? I’m not going to put my money into SPCE unless they can integrate it into their Virgin Airlines and do London - New York flights by way of orbit. I totally think this is why he started Virgin Galactic, he just needs to focus on that goal. Not space tourism."

2021-05-02 20:24:19,wallstreetbets,"For Virgin Galactic, the flight profile is SpaceShipIII being carried under the WhiteKnightTwo mothership at slow speeds (200 knots or so) up to 40,000 feet, which takes 2 hours.  The mothership then drop-launches SpacesShipIII, which burns its rocket motor for 70 seconds to get up to Mach 3 to get above 80km altitude.  Then about 10 minutes of freefall (zero-g), then glide back to the airstrip.  Total trip duration about 3 hours.

For Blue Origin, the New Shepard rocket launches straight up and gets up to Mach 3 in about 120 seconds.  The capsule separates and coasts up to over 100 km altitude, then starts to freefall into the atmosphere for about 10 minutes of zero-g.  Then parachutes deploy and the capsule floats down to the desert floor.  Total air time about 15 minutes or so.

Virgin Galactic operates from Spaceport America, which is about 10 miles or so in the desert to the east of Truth or Consequences, NM.  VG might not get to fly paid customers until next year.

Blue Origin operates from Corn Ranch about 150 miles to the southeast, in the desert about 40 miles north of Van Horn, TX.  Blue Origin is aiming to fly passengers next month (though it is not clear if it will be paid customers)."
2021-05-03 03:53:53,wallstreetbets,Well there goes that thought process. But can it not serve as a development platform for it? With tourists footing the Bill?
2021-05-03 03:51:30,wallstreetbets,What is stopping Space X from building its own station for tourists?
2021-05-03 13:19:43,wallstreetbets,Very cool. Thanks for sharing.
2021-05-02 20:30:00,wallstreetbets,">But the spacecraft lands as a glider, which prevents a serious issue from the point of air traffic control. Unpowered planes can and do land at airports during emergencies – but this is achieved by having aircraft that still have power wait in a holding pattern to free up a runway. 

A glider presents 0 additional difficulty compared to a powered aircraft. You have a known flight profile and can have extra long (5+ minute) clearance windows to be extra safe. 

But a glider will land at the same speed as a single engine airplane, which already get to land at all but the busiest of airports without it being a massive deal or emergencies only."
2021-05-03 03:49:57,wallstreetbets,"The extra long clearance window (and the fact it can’t be moved) would be the problem of gliding into a busy airport. Go on, ask for permission to land a glider at Heathrow. I’m sure you will give them a laugh.

More suitable airstrips will be further from urban centres and transport networks, making them less useful for point to point"

2021-05-03 07:56:48,wallstreetbets,"Elective medical care is much cheaper than hospitalization. Hospitalization is 5-10x more expensive. Covid is not short hospitalizations either, being 7-14 days. A double bypass is about 3-4 days, and may be up to 7 days.

Can't believe you are comparing getting antibiotics to a covid stay. You are looking at insurer cost of $300-500 versus $300-500k. 

Your point isn't reality because you have no concept of healthcare costs. ICU >>> Managed stay > recovery stay/elective care."
2021-05-03 08:13:21,wallstreetbets,"You should also read UHCs annual report, which says that care levels exceeded seasonal levels last quarter.

2021-05-02 21:12:05,wallstreetbets,"The thing is, seric antibodies are great, but it's not the targeted mechanism of this vaccine. It doesn't need it to work, the immune system has many ways of functioning, and T-cell response as well as mucosal antibodies can both be effective at preventing the disease at the respiratory tract infection level, possibly without needing to resort to blood antibodies. The market does not understand this, and it will possibly tank the price. 4th year broke med student from Morocco here, seeing the potential of a vaccine that does not need much infrastructure to be delivered worldwide especially to poor countries.

It is and always will be a simple point of reference. In addition, I commonly think of the physical layer as 7 as developer because I start at the presentation layer. You could letter these a through g if you want... it really doesn't matter. This isnt an exam.

2021-05-03 12:22:18,wallstreetbets,"Uh huh. Yeah, it obviously takes a really deep understanding to get it *completely* backwards and *defend it*.

Mmm yes, lets plug that layer 7 cable into the layer 6 switch, use layer 5.5 MPLS to get it to the layer 5 router to go to the layer 3 OS, to pass to the layer 2 software/api to be displayed by the layer 1 software for the Zero to click.

> In addition, I commonly think of the physical layer as 7 as developer because I start at the presentation layer.

Don't you mean layer 1? It works both ways!

You're right that it's literally introductory. I really can't believe that as a self professed *developer* you're dying on this hill though."

You're correction about the OSI model from a textbook standpoint is correct. What is incorrect is your interpretation of the information provided. My real assumption is that you don't actually grasp the other information he shared and why the OSI model was used... so you're just trying to make everyone feel bad...orrr... like most people starting out... you want everyone to know you're a genius and the only way to do so is to be angry about it.

You condescendingly defended it, and then started projecting all sorts of crazy bullshit in an attempt to appear superior.

Only if you're a condescending twat who immediately plays the man instead of the ball. Otherwise, it's pretty peachy.

I can't imagine working with you would be a picnic. Perhaps you'd like to think about that for a while. How often do you ""subtly"" sneer at your colleagues?

2021-05-02 22:13:13,wallstreetbets,"Check the data. Their revenue growth has stalled already, check the past 2 quarters. 

And you expect it to ACCELERATE once the world opens back up? They literally could lose business and see revenue decrease by end of 2021, that’s the opposite of growth, and certainly nowhere near what you need to justify 100x earnings. If they grow earnings at 30% for the next 5 years, that would put them around $4bn in annual profit. That’s a big IF, and frankly very unlikely. Even if that happened, they would be priced with a 25 P/E. 

They are incredibly, incredibly overvalued at this point. They have no moat whatsoever, it’s legacy tech and everyone has it. Every big tech player has it, and it’s commodity on Azure and AWS for devs to build on.

Where do you think they can get 30% YoY growth from? I’m struggling to find it, but I miss things often."

No they are not quiet, in fact that sound like garbage on the K70 or any of Corsair other boards because the key caps and stabilizers are such trash."
2021-05-03 08:46:21,wallstreetbets,Explain to me why both keyboards have 4 star ratings on over thousands of reviews on Amazon and Best Buy? I love how you are trying to act as if the general consensus is that Corsair products are garbage but thousands of gamer reviews disagree. Talking about ignorance😂😂😂
2021-05-03 14:28:33,wallstreetbets,"Because people don’t know what they’re talking about? Corsair makes good RGB and that draws people in. Why do you think beats headphones sell so well even though their sound quality is rubbish for their price?

Actually get into keyboards and you’ll quickly realize why the K70 should be $50-60 max.

And where are those reviews coming from? Random people and blanket review websites?
I can’t find a single keyboard specialized review site or channel that praises Corsair keyboard. Even small time keyboard channels know you don’t buy a Corsair keyboard due to their subpar quality for its price."
2021-05-03 14:36:45,wallstreetbets,"If you want to get into keyboards, and the various aspects of them, head over to r/mechanicalkeyboards and ask away.

2021-05-03 12:47:51,wallstreetbets,"There's no real question in my mind whether the Fed CAN stamp out inflation.  As you say, hike up rates, stop QE, tell the government to stop dropping helicopter money, done.

The question is, other than controlling inflation, what are the other effects of such actions, and can the Fed/Govt stomach them? 

Crashing stocks and real estate is not popular, not to mention the trillions of their own debt governments at all levels have to carry now.  Do you think Congress would be happy suddenly having to pay  8% per year on their spending spree instead of 1%?"
2021-05-03 12:50:30,wallstreetbets,"The official figures show nationwide average income was up like 12+% last year.  Granted that's all government helicopter money (enhanced unemployment, PPP, multiple stimulus checks, child tax credit, etc).

I think your mistake is just looking at wages, which yes, are pretty flat or down for some people.. But looking at all income, the average American had a pretty flush year last year."

2021-05-03 17:46:49,wallstreetbets,"Hey thank you for this excellent response! Remember that JPow has been through a similar situation before in 2018/2019. He knows how to coast or feather the brake pedal to slow down, instead of stomping on it. This will be a slow and steady return to still low but slightly higher rates like 2019.

The current sources of inflation are all tied to asset inflation and seem dramatic in the the short term. The Fed is comfortable with this because they want the wealth effect from asset inflation. In addition, they rightly are not perturbed by this short term inflation, because they have orders of magnitude more data at speeds that were unimaginable during the inflation of the 70s."
2021-05-03 14:45:42,wallstreetbets,"I am Canadian. There was zero dollars of stimulus checks sent out. Yes, some people did get extended unemployment money for being out of work due to covid. But it was a wage cut for most."

Anecdotal I know, but that (and the sheer madness we faced while house shopping in the suburbs) is enough to make me skeptical of the 'everyone's basically back in NYC  already' narrative."
2021-05-03 17:56:23,wallstreetbets,"All that makes me think is pride comes before the fall.

It's clear jpow is confident (or at least projecting that) in his ability to handle this but I'm less so.

2018/2019 doesn't exactly inspire confidence. The magnitude of the taper needed there was 1/10 the size and still caused a significant market dump."
2021-05-03 15:30:19,wallstreetbets,"Fair.. I think most people here are concerned with the US market and economy because well, it's more than 10x the size.

For Canada I think there was less direct stimulus but your rates are lower and bond buying was even higher than America so probably that played a role."
2021-05-02 21:30:27,wallstreetbets,I tried to find counter examples to this but it appears you’re mostly right.
2021-05-03 18:01:42,wallstreetbets,"But the lessons from 2018/2019, Europe after 08 crisis, and Japan's lost decade were that the risk of stagflation (moderate inflation, no growth/recession) is higher than it seems. So it is better to risk moderately higher average inflation in the short to medium term to reach escape velocity/avoid stagflation."

Ford is still deep in LiDAR. They're invested in Argo and sold off VLDR because it's inferior to what they're already developing in-house."
2021-05-02 20:18:58,wallstreetbets,Yeah I don’t buy it. If Microsoft and Mercedes likes your product then you have more than $500K a quarter.
2021-05-03 12:26:24,wallstreetbets,"He said what I wanted to see, so please don't discourage the logical."
2021-05-03 08:14:05,wallstreetbets,It wasn't $500. Appears that way because of an 8x reverse split
2021-05-02 21:22:20,wallstreetbets,Not if a there is a lot of debt due to R&D esp with Lidar
2021-05-02 23:53:50,wallstreetbets,R&D and debt has nothing to do with $500K in revenue per quarter. Down $1MM from a year ago so it’s pretty clear people aren’t buying their crap.

2021-05-03 16:47:34,wallstreetbets,450 at $43
2021-05-03 12:13:05,wallstreetbets,"IMO = I think it's worth it.. you can chance playing the ""NIO money"" somewhere else and hoping you can increase it and catch it back into NIO when NIO drops again (you seen the kind of ""morning-afternoon"" thing with NIO, I guess..)  .. but also you don't want to miss it when it don't drop again.. I think that will come. I have other fun stuff to do and I can sit on the NIO, because I'm CONVINCED it is the way to go. I just resent not having more NIO shares and still enough fiat to play with (My other holds are just holds, I don't feel urge to add to them or trade them, AND anyhow they gone up too expensive to add to, already)  But in my head now NIO is there for the duration, it's off the play list.  That's the way it is."
2021-05-03 12:04:52,wallstreetbets,"it just has to go up to what it's worth - then NIO are admitted to being one of the **big boys** in the world auto game, instead of ""some Chinese company or other"". And after that ?

\* \* \*

**TLDR** :

IMO (=and ONLY totally IMO=) I think a lot of USA retail traders are kind of fixated on US companies (even if the US company has its manufacturing & it's raw materials & parts supply & assembly and packaging & crating AND labor 100% in Asia) ..

It's  attitude << *I'll even take some small tiny drop in my percentage for the feeling of supporting our US economy but I'll be damned if I'll put dollars into China* \>>

Hey, I'm not saying that's wrong. I just wonder how many retail traders notice it in themselves.

And if a trader want to buy shares because its a nationalist American thing to do - then I won't fault them on that, they ain't necessarily no computer just looking to maximize gains wherever they come from.

Just don't underestimate China & Asia.

It's where **every bit** of APPLE stuff comes from (they don't source or make a gram of doodly squat on the EEN-TIRRE USA continent, they just live here). 

China is where the USA buys 95% of its rare earth metals, and without them, you cant have chips - hell, you cant have Civilization.

So that folk worry about China **weaponizing** it's production of just almost all  of the worlds rare earth metals.. Because without those rare earth metals we ain't GOT no civilization, and they can charge the price they like anyhow.. Interesting situation.

so is that good/bad or just straight-up worth investing in? Or pay more or even earn a bit less, and try to keep Tesla up front?

decisions .. decisions .."

2021-05-03 19:01:28,wallstreetbets,"Any stock you think will go up. For instance bc slv went up 10% today. So i bought that earlier because i thought it was going up.
  
  
The beauty of trading online nowadays is you don't *have* to buy that 500 dollar share. You can buy 25 dollars worth of the same share. Ifi goes up 50% you made 50% on 25 dollars."
2021-05-03 19:08:08,wallstreetbets,I get what you’re saying. What was the co you mentioned? bc slv? Is that an autocorrect error?

2021-05-03 13:23:48,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure the mods discourage frequent updates of unrealized gains (and I think that's the right thing). I'll probably post again either a month from now or if there's a really huge move (like silver going over $30)

2021-05-02 23:30:49,wallstreetbets,Well there are a lot of uranium mining stocks. Look at BSK. I wouldn't want to take physical possession of uranium. Take physical possession of a few silver coins instead its healthier

Compounding losses seems like a losing proposition. Buy the dips and get your cost basis down is the real answer. The more you buy at a cheaper price, the less it has to go up to be profitable.

For this stock to rise in the short and medium term, it needs positive PR to hit on some sort of strategic partnerships and I do see that likely to happen if the CEO didn't lie about specs and progression. You just need to benchmark it to LAZR and it's not that unreasonable for MVIS to go to 30 on a big announcement."

2021-05-03 11:59:50,wallstreetbets,"Thats exactly the argument that was made for dotcom companies in the runup to the dotcom bust - that PE doesnt matter, value them on their future prospects etc,  but when evaluating a company its important not to ignore the facts, NOK isn't a growth company because its revenue isnt growing, revenue has been consistently 25-26B the last 5-6 years (& one good quarter isnt enough to say that has changed), NOK also isnt currently a value play because it is already at the top end of its valuation for a mature tech company with little/no growth i.e. 26 x earnings, in order for it to be a value play you'd want to be paying around $1 to $2 per share.

Like all stock NOK will have a run on the current good news but eventually stock always reverts back to the value of its earnings + dividends, this market bull run will end the same way and all companies will come back to their long-running mean valuation"
2021-05-03 19:53:39,wallstreetbets,"For growth stocks, P/E isn't as important; most worthwhile growth stocks might not have positive P/E let alone positive EBITDA. That's why a mature company that re-invests in themselves isn't a bad play IMO. Sure you say overvalued, I say potentially a good investment. 

Also, you do realize they are trading 26x earnings because they legitimately said themselves that their margins will need to run near zero in order to invest in RnD? You think they have little/no growth, but literally that's why they are trading with such high P/E. They are investing in their growth. Although there's a chance they don't succeed, I think they have potential to become a leader in 6g. They have over 1/3 of their market cap in cash and they are investing that cash to grow and capture market share and intellectual property. There's always going to be higher risk investing in growth.

I'd rather be buy side than sell side right now, that's for sure. Although, I personally don't even have a position as all my money is in another sector that I think will be extremely bullish in the near future. 

(One more thing) After typing this, I checked their P/E and I'm pretty sure that their TTM P/E doesn't exist because it's negative. Not sure where you're getting 26 unless it's based on just one Q or something. Not worth it for me to dig too much further though."

2021-05-02 21:42:07,wallstreetbets,NVDA > AMD
2021-05-03 10:58:16,wallstreetbets,"Check the May 7th options, The cut-off is 80$. The bulk of options are above $80, 48 millions of share. [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD/options?p=AMD&straddle=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD/options?p=AMD&straddle=true)

Think 85M short + 45M shares in call options. Hedge funds will drive down the price..

Last week was similar..

I have been monitoring the Options and Short sellers and I posted last week what my expectation was based on the Call/put ratio. I posted the chart in the r/AMD_Stock channel.

Simplistically, AMD has

1. 85% of the shares held by institutions
2. Short portion as of 04/15 is approx 83M shares 6-7% of the float.
3. OPTIONS on the other hand, had approx 14+M shard above 82. Which meant, market makers and hedge funds would have lost a pretty coin if the shares went up.

We saw that in Q4 Blow out earning, call options vastly exceeded put, and the shares tanked. April 30th after Q1 blow out earnings, the big cutoff was 82$, so short sellers, predominately the hedge funds selling those contracts, drove the price down.

This week is no different, with one minor exception, XLINIX is reporting on May 4th.

The ONLY 2 ways we can change this, 1 is in our control, the other waiting for the Chinese gov to approve the merger transaction (that would be big news).

Here is what I suggest we should do:

1- If you have shares, put a LIMIT SELL order at $1000/share. That will make you shares unavailable for naked shorting. The less shares available the more it costs short seller to borrow and short sell. KEEP in mind, the short seller position AMD has is not that big. BUT and this is a BIG ONE, the combination of the short seller position and the CALL CONTRACTS in the next 4 months is MASSIVE. THUS the pressure and potential squeeze.

2- BUY and hold shares, and repeat number step number 1

3- buy call options (NOT WITH SHORT TERM EXPIRY).

THIS IS NOT AN INVESTMENT ADVICE, merely observation on what I have been seeing and continue to see with one my favourite companies. Let's make it painful for the short sellers and hedge funds.

I Own AMD SHARES for full disclosure. AGAIN, this is NOT AN INVESTMENT ADVICE, do your homework, and check the option tab on yahoo or on your favourite site."

2021-05-03 10:18:59,wallstreetbets,"Difference now though is GME will be competing against Microsoft Game Pass. Xbox store, PS Store, Steam and Epic Game store. GME has been in the decline for a decade. 2 to 3 years ago gamestop was the laughing stock of the gaming world and was often memed for its silliness. Sure GME is making moves. But we all know it has quite the competition. If it works cool. But to think GME is better than game pass or any of these digital areas is not truthful. More and more people are going digital. It's not a myth. Look at GME for a decade. It has drastically dropped. They closed tons of stores and laid off tons of employees. How will they compete digitally? You can buy from them sure? But I doubt Xbox or Playstation will allow gamestop to sell on their platforms digitally. I hold stock in GME. But a couple years ago we were all laughing at how outrageous and screwed gamestop was until it became a meme stock."

Only downside right now is that I’m very tired and I feel a bit out of touch with reality. I feel drunk and sober at the same time which makes me think I got the placebo but who knows. 
I tried searching online if these post trip annoyances are common and I couldn’t find anything. They only said that short term you could feel more anxiety(which I certainly do) or worse before you feel better.

2021-05-03 14:40:19,wallstreetbets,printing initiated.
2021-05-02 20:22:00,wallstreetbets,Dude your beyond retarded. Give up mod
2021-05-02 20:22:21,wallstreetbets,Because of power trips
2021-05-03 10:19:43,wallstreetbets,Bag holding DCA of 26 right now. Extremely positive and patient. Like the stock and not selling.
2021-05-03 14:38:41,wallstreetbets,its not over until youre out
2021-05-03 13:21:34,wallstreetbets,Well this didn’t age well
2021-05-02 20:12:31,wallstreetbets,You are probably using linear scale instead of logarithmic scale for price.
2021-05-02 20:15:07,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that explains it! But is drawing a line accurate when its not linear? I genuinely don’t know, thanks for answering"
2021-05-02 20:55:37,wallstreetbets,Yes. In this case the trend lines are reflecting the logarithmic price change. I personally prefer log scale because it reflects % change. E.g. A 100 dollar stock going up 20$ is the same as a 10 dollar stock going up 2$.  Both are 20% moves.
2021-05-02 20:56:14,wallstreetbets,Ok gotchu thanks bro
2021-05-03 17:47:31,wallstreetbets,"""If they decide to buy the COVAXIN from OCUGEN, we will see the likes of another GME born before our eyes.""

This tells you just how fucking dumb Ocugen investors are. You have 45% of US sales. Is the US in India? You get NOTHING from any use or sale in India."

2021-05-03 15:41:52,wallstreetbets,Any idea why the stock is tanking so much every day the last week? Did not find anything online?
2021-05-03 18:51:55,wallstreetbets,"Never mind this guy lied!!!

2021-05-03 09:28:34,wallstreetbets,"Didn't work for those who didn't know when to sell... I for when, once I saw a dip of 5% I wisely concluded that we hit the peak and got out in time. 65% up was more than enough for me."
2021-05-03 01:11:03,wallstreetbets,Should have taped and posted your GUH moment. Would have guaranteed you as a first-ballot hall of famer in WSB's retard museum.
2021-05-02 21:27:57,wallstreetbets,"Fuck AMC, it's an obvious distraction from gme... divide and conquer."

2021-05-03 10:34:41,wallstreetbets,"Dude, you’re the man. Bought 20 6/18 13c CLNE for .80 when it dipped below $11 at open. Already up $200, I appreciate you sharing your insight."
2021-05-03 11:49:21,wallstreetbets,You are being downvoted because you misunderstood this post. Yes this is a surface level opinion of a few stock. A few stocks that OP has already posted DD if you look at their profile. This is a recap post of how those DDs actually played out.
2021-05-03 16:13:39,wallstreetbets,Literally bought one GME cause of this.
2021-05-03 02:03:34,wallstreetbets,This man’s DD is on point and I forgot to say this last week.. there’s even WallStreet analysts that are saying GME about to skyrocket.
2021-05-03 03:12:04,wallstreetbets,You fucking autist. You actually did it.

2021-05-03 16:26:46,wallstreetbets,"Dude wtf are you talking about? Your title says ""why its time to take profits"". That was flat out wrong as fuck home boy."
