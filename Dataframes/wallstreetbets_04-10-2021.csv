2021-04-10 19:07:20,wallstreetbets,Hope them options you have turn way up b4 expiring🙌💎🤑
2021-04-10 19:46:16,wallstreetbets,See a doctor if the condition lasts more than four months.
2021-04-10 19:48:17,wallstreetbets,You are not alone.
2021-04-10 18:59:39,wallstreetbets,Holy Molly I only have 29 shares 😅
2021-04-10 19:01:44,wallstreetbets,I want to see a big squeeze so I can short

2021-04-10 18:59:03,wallstreetbets,Don’t post your positions🙄😤
2021-04-10 19:35:34,wallstreetbets,Open the goddamn casino already!
2021-04-10 19:21:36,wallstreetbets,The best part about glory holes is the hot chick on the other side doesn’t get mad when you’re buying GME at the same time.

2021-04-10 19:20:38,wallstreetbets,Don’t know why this would be downvoted. Great idea 👌🏼
2021-04-10 19:48:33,wallstreetbets,Did you know it’s tomorrow in Tokyo. So some people alive here are already dead in Tokyo.
2021-04-10 19:37:44,wallstreetbets,New here?
2021-04-10 19:24:36,wallstreetbets,I thought i felt whiskers but maybe I was imagining that.
2021-04-10 19:36:52,wallstreetbets,"Sell at the peak, short on the way down cover when market price is rational"
2021-04-10 19:26:14,wallstreetbets,You’d be surprised how many hot chicks dont laser their face hair.
2021-04-10 19:47:40,wallstreetbets,"Better idea: 
1. Put in as much as you can

2. Have your wife’s boyfriend change the password to your brokerage account 

3. Have him tell you the password in 5 years and you’ll see many tendies."
2021-04-10 19:58:23,wallstreetbets,You can't short when a stock is going down.
2021-04-10 17:55:44,wallstreetbets,"Undervalued relevant to only profits maybe, they have issues lol. One big legislative move about ads directed at kids and there goes idk, 1/4? 1/8? of revenue. Let alone other proposed changes."

2021-04-10 17:51:12,wallstreetbets,They need to fix privacy issues!
2021-04-10 18:03:55,wallstreetbets,No for me. There are better stocks to invest in than FB.
2021-04-10 18:17:57,wallstreetbets,"Your EPS v PE ratio v Market price of shares doesn't seem to add up.

An EPS of 2 bucks something on a market price of 280 bucks infers a PE north of 100x when you have a PE stipulated at around 30.

My understanding has always been EPS x PE = Mkt price of a share."
2021-04-10 18:00:03,wallstreetbets,Can i hate a company but love the stock? Asking for a friend.
2021-04-10 18:14:05,wallstreetbets,"So where are you interning now?

Edit: LOL! Don’t think he gets it bois....."
2021-04-10 18:12:25,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for writing this, it might seem passé to some to see DD on such a well known company but it was well written and I feel inspired to consider a new position in FB.

I do not use FB and I hate a lot about what they do...but I love them as an investment and I owe a lot of my wealth to this company. I bought FB at the IPO, doubled my position when it was *cut in half* only a few weeks later. I put in 69K, a lot of money for me at the time.

I held for seven years. 

We all talk about Diamond hands but seven years is a looong time, especially when the price would get pummeled extra hard with every little controversy or criticism and had to claw its way back up. It was like 90 percent of my portfolio at certain times - even when I was selling off everything else I would never sell FB. I just knew this company was unstoppable. It still is.

I got out in early 2020, was like an eight bagger for me. Ridiculous gains. And I wish I had stayed in!"
2021-04-10 18:02:02,wallstreetbets,"Facebook is just like Google at facade-based bubble.  The truth is internet advertising has never really generated any actual cash value.  

The value is there because of the PR magic that's done on a daily basis.  With all their privacy issues and their inability to run a corporation within the confines of the law, this is a stock that should be shorted into oblivion."
2021-04-10 19:24:48,wallstreetbets,"I would invest in the Antichrist or coal companies before I invested in Facebook. 

Thankfully there’s plenty of other stocks with more potential that don’t involve exchanging my soul to make some tendies."
2021-04-10 17:54:36,wallstreetbets,"Just a question. Isn't the Nasdaq over value right now. Don't get me wrong, I think there still upswing potential. But wouldn't it better to wait for the correction?"
2021-04-10 17:58:42,wallstreetbets,They need to get ride of the alien and work on their PR
2021-04-10 17:50:31,wallstreetbets,"Fuck it I’m in.   I read two paragraphs and you sound pretty smart     Dropping 2k in Monday 
Cheers 🥂"
2021-04-10 19:45:11,wallstreetbets,"TL:DR but I have recently reached a point in my life where I have deleted FB from it almost completely, still have the messenger app so strange outlier contacts/people can still contact me but as they do so I am passing along my phone # and other communication routes, so I can eventually eliminate messenger too. FB is on it's way out of my universe. That's why I didn't read this and have no intention to."
2021-04-10 18:04:06,wallstreetbets,Everyone gets an A in MBA classes you pay $$$ to go there lol
2021-04-10 19:17:20,wallstreetbets,"I addressed this, did I not? They are far less vulnerable from common and systemic risks than say, Tesla...and no more vulnerable to legislation/antitrust than Google or Apple or Amazon. 

They are undervalued from a DFCF model and a comparable firm model. With earnings multiple expansion getting priced into everything, $FB is a bargain with nothing but upside, relative to its tech peers."
2021-04-10 19:14:15,wallstreetbets,Are they not?
2021-04-10 18:41:13,wallstreetbets,"Interesting, I'm not familiar with that formula. I tried it on FB's current TTM EPS of $10.09 and PE of 30.94. According to your formula, this is a price of 312.18, which is rather congruent with the current share price of 312.19. Admittedly, I never heard of this formula but I will have to apply it to other examples. I googled it too and didn't find anything about this particular formula."
2021-04-10 18:17:50,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-04-10 18:15:40,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely. You got a friend in me with that. I hate Facebook, don't even have a profile, but as an objective evaluator...one cannot deny its ability to generate free cash flow. Something that is desperately needed more across the stock market, IMO."
2021-04-10 18:24:38,wallstreetbets,Nowhere. I work in marketing lol. I love finance though and would jump at a prop shop or hedge fund if they asked.
2021-04-10 18:22:56,wallstreetbets,"Thanks bro! 7 years \*is\* a long time! I'm not sure if I would have held that long. Admittedly I need to work on being more patient. I'm glad you got an 8 bagger! We all wish that we went all-in after March 24, 2020. Hindsight is a bitch lol

What are you liking these days, besides maybe $FB?"
2021-04-10 19:17:38,wallstreetbets,Citation needed
2021-04-10 18:13:38,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but relative to other tech stocks, $FB hasn't been priced in the way every other tech company has. More upside than downside IMO. In my defense the stock was trading at $280 when I wrote this. It's now $312.19."
2021-04-10 18:43:27,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-04-10 18:44:32,wallstreetbets,Never had a fb page. Never will. Hate the company in general but cant deny it prints more money than the fuckin fed
2021-04-10 19:12:50,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man. Pretty stoked about the COIN public offering this coming week. I will be in and looking for momentum. I’m also bullish on BABA, PLTR, and legal weed"
2021-04-10 18:15:34,wallstreetbets,Thanks  I'll look into deeper. Thanks for posting.
2021-04-10 17:46:57,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! In 10 years “TQQQ banger”
2021-04-10 19:15:35,wallstreetbets,I wanted to be able to look at the chart and split history and mindlessly parrot the whole decay will destroy you thing but that has not been the case on the 10 year chart. I suspect this might get completely destroyed in a repeat of 08 but was very surprised how well its done the last decade
2021-04-10 19:13:14,wallstreetbets,"There's a pretty large cult following and a few years of dd for long term 3x etfs[1]. Look up UPRO and TMF as that's the most popular combination, but TQQQ is up there too.

1. https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=288192"
2021-04-10 18:05:06,wallstreetbets,"Completely agree. I understand the points against it, and I understand that “but if QQQ drops 33.33% in one day, you’ll lose everything!” but I’m with you. I’ve been holding a decent amount of TQQQ for a while now, and have been happy."
2021-04-10 18:17:07,wallstreetbets,"For what it’s worth, I sell $20k in covered calls on tqqq just about every week and make out like a bandit."
2021-04-10 17:37:34,wallstreetbets,Bruh but muh slippage and corrections
2021-04-10 18:44:05,wallstreetbets,"TQQQ is like playing double dutch on the playground. You jump in, then you jump out."
2021-04-10 18:05:42,wallstreetbets,If you hold it long term you will lose money. Since it is leveraged if you hold it long enough it will eventually bleed you dry.
2021-04-10 17:47:34,wallstreetbets,"It's not intended as a long term investment or something you hold onto.  You use it on an intraday basis for leverage.

>This ETF offers 3x daily long leverage to the NASDAQ-100 Index, making it a powerful tool for investors with a bullish short-term outlook for nonfinancial equities. Investors should note that TQQQ's leverage resets on a daily basis, which results in compounding of returns when held for multiple periods. TQQQ can be a powerful tool for sophisticated investors, but **should be avoided by those with a low risk tolerance or a buy-and-hold strategy**."
2021-04-10 18:10:19,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-10 18:19:54,wallstreetbets,"This is terrible advice...leveraged etf's get obliterated when the stock moves up and down, even if it moves in your direction...the do worse than 1x.
They get destroyed in volatile conditions..and not from rebalancing...from simple math.

They are only good if the thing only moves up...and so should not be held for more than a day or 2."
2021-04-10 17:38:30,wallstreetbets,"Lmao @ buying TQQQ instead of FNGU

Look up the holdings of FNGU then delete this post in shame"
2021-04-10 19:26:27,wallstreetbets,"This is really terrible and the exact opposite of what is true. 

If you invest $100 and on the first day QQQ is down 5%, then up 5% the following day... what do you think your value is?"
2021-04-10 19:51:42,wallstreetbets,Good luck if hyper inflation hits. You be losing money 3x faster
2021-04-10 19:24:48,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn’t buy into leveraged qqq while we’re at ATH. Wait for a good dip, buy 100 shares, wait for it to be at a new ath and sell a call"
2021-04-10 18:50:46,wallstreetbets,As i understand it though with 3x daily leverage doesnt it mean that if the nasdaq fell 33.33% on any given day the fund would be reduced to 0? God i cant remember it off the top of my head but there was a 3x leverage fund that i believed tracked volatility. I could be wrong but as the saga played out what was once a 20x fund over 3 years got reduced to $0. Maybe im thinking of something else and correct me if im wrong cause this was on the news a couple years back and why i didnt decide to buy tqqq even though it was doing so great and still is

2021-04-10 19:52:55,wallstreetbets,"I’ve held a 40/60 split of upro/tqqq for last 5 years and added to my position a few times each year. I’ve seen 4.5x returns in 5 years. 

It’s only 30% of my portfolio, but it started as 10% of portfolio and has naturally grown and become a larger portion of my portfolio as I do not rebalance. 

Yes there is decay. The leverage is via options so it’s never 100% correlated, but I’ve still managed to do quite well...my own opinion."
2021-04-10 18:39:41,wallstreetbets,You can hedge that with penny puts though. Moot point
2021-04-10 18:27:19,wallstreetbets,How many shares do you own?
2021-04-10 18:34:30,wallstreetbets,People are kinda moronic in not realizing the money is in selling options. I can’t believe it’s not as widespread.
2021-04-10 19:52:18,wallstreetbets,Except I’m up roughly 70k on a 3x fund that I’ve held since 2016. I’ll take that DeCAy over losers like IBM any day.
2021-04-10 19:23:53,wallstreetbets,It tracks nasdaq so...it’ll just be 3x leveraged on whatever difference nasdaq goes through. You won’t be bled dry unless it crashes 50% 😂
2021-04-10 18:23:15,wallstreetbets,"So that is not true.

2021-04-10 18:38:13,wallstreetbets,I’d like to say none of the QQQ are for beginners or anyone whose not got really good knowledge of sticks in general. Because when I first started out investing I ran 1k turned it to 15k in like 1 month COVID started to peak went all in on sqqq got destroyed holding for a month looking for some type of bounce back. Would’ve done already had I cashed out like the next day or two but I held till it was nearly 0

2021-04-10 17:55:45,wallstreetbets,Lmao @ this guy talking about buying a ticker with no options availability.
2021-04-10 19:30:34,wallstreetbets,99.75. so if you read the post before you touched your keyboard you would realize that I explained all of the problems that everyone has discussed so far. You tried.
2021-04-10 19:52:38,wallstreetbets,So you just chose to not read the post but comment anyways. Hot take.
2021-04-10 19:29:26,wallstreetbets,Time in the market always beats timing the market.
2021-04-10 19:31:23,wallstreetbets,Its not really possible for it to drop 33% in one day because of halts.
2021-04-10 19:10:29,wallstreetbets,"As I understand, the positions get rebalanced when market tanks, so it's never really going to go to 0, but it can go very low if tech stocks tank for a long time and even if they rebound it might take a long time before you make your money back."
2021-04-10 18:59:19,wallstreetbets,"They want you to believe they own 20,000 TQQQ, and sell weeklies against it.  I guess that’s ONE way to play $2million in the market. 🤨"
2021-04-10 19:43:03,wallstreetbets,"Currently have 7,500 shares.

Sold covered calls against all of them Thursday."
2021-04-10 19:07:07,wallstreetbets,"Probably zero, because buying and holding TQQQ is idiotic.  He’s almost definitely covering those calls with cash."

2021-04-10 18:04:43,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, OP is specifically talking about ""long term holdings"" too so it's not entirely irrelevant.

....not that I'm *not* doing this with SPXL myself, mind you."
2021-04-10 18:04:21,wallstreetbets,"No, are you? OP is the one pushing a long term investment, which is neither WSB material or the right way to play this ETF, but what do I know?"
2021-04-10 19:02:30,wallstreetbets,He isn’t but you and OP seem to be. This sub isn’t for buying and holding shares long term.  That’s what /r/investing is for.
2021-04-10 19:04:01,wallstreetbets,Stop spamming the same dead link and just admit you don’t know what you’re talking about.

2021-04-10 19:05:41,wallstreetbets,"See the dollar sign in his comment? He said $20K in covered calls. That takes $20K in cash to cover, not $2M. He didn’t say 20,000 shares. 

This sub is going to shit."
2021-04-10 19:44:41,wallstreetbets,As in 1dte ccs?
2021-04-10 19:09:56,wallstreetbets,"So you came here to troll, you didn't read the post, and now you're raging because you can't read? What a show."
2021-04-10 19:02:49,wallstreetbets,There are plenty of resources out there by people who are much smarter than me that say there is no inherent decay created by leverage. I linked you to a paper that describes the math behind it. Also the graph and the post solidifies that it literally does not exist.
2021-04-10 18:28:50,wallstreetbets,"While it may not fit with the overall ethos of the sub, there's nothing that says I can't have a long term or talk about a long term. Put all your money in TQQQ and call it a yolo if you want idc honestly."
2021-04-10 19:17:26,wallstreetbets,"You want to tell that to DFV?

He didn’t jump in the day before it hit the stratosphere.

2021-04-10 19:06:09,wallstreetbets,So I fixed the link no go read it and admit you don't know what you're talking about
2021-04-10 19:37:08,wallstreetbets,So just curious how you think 95*1.05=97.75. I mean I understand not learning math but you never learned how to use a calculator? Might as well just donate yourself to primate exhibit at the local zoo.
2021-04-10 19:41:50,wallstreetbets,They're called circuit breakers... If the market goes down 20% trading is halted for the rest of the day...
2021-04-10 19:37:08,wallstreetbets,"You read that wrong. I own a shit ton of shares and generate $20,000 in profit from the call premium.

This sub is indeed going to shit."
2021-04-10 19:21:40,wallstreetbets,"Came here to defend someone else’s lie.  Super weird.

So now the story is: calls “covered” not by shares but with cash, which is not the definition of a covered call.  So really, we’re to assume they are selling naked calls, against a leveraged bull ETF, in this market, and making out “like a bandit”.  Okay."

2021-04-10 19:24:28,wallstreetbets,I'm not defending him. The guy who I replied to is being a c*nt. Its literally my post. I just asked a question. And pardon me for not realizing he didn't mean a covered call when he said a covered call.

2021-04-10 19:58:09,wallstreetbets,Well I mean just don't be like this chump over here and claim that mathematics dictates that a leveraged fund must decay over time when the mathematics says that is not true.

2021-04-10 19:30:02,wallstreetbets,"We’re on the same side.  The story was suspicious, and then they swoop in to provide cover.  All while degrading the sub as “going to sh*t”, from an account that is only a year old.  I guess that counts as a “real OG” on Reddit.  Lol 

On your original post, I’d need to understand better how TQQQ is composed, rebalanced etc. before making it a long-term play.  I’ve dipped here and there, but certainly not months or years."
2021-04-10 19:12:25,wallstreetbets,That’s not the decay I was taking about - I’m talking about theta decay.
2021-04-10 19:58:59,wallstreetbets,Thankfully we haven’t met and 95 is wrong. Have fun staying poor.
2021-04-10 19:34:02,wallstreetbets,"For sure. And I do understand that -20% over a year is going to be hard to hold but if you continue to add to the position it balances out plus ever since I switched to E-TRADE (from robinhood) I spend significantly less amount of time watching charts and getting emotionally involved with my investments and it's easy for me to watch total gain/loss vs daily, monthly or yearly gain/loss."
2021-04-10 19:13:21,wallstreetbets,Theta decay for a stock... Interesting take...
2021-04-10 19:22:07,wallstreetbets,These are created using options in most cases - hence my financial derivatives comment.  How else do you think the leverage is created?
2021-04-10 19:44:09,wallstreetbets,"Okay, but if it's rebalanced daily to produce the amount of leverage how does theta effect anything. Plus, the graphs kinda show that theta really isn't that big of an issue as it still outperformed QQQ by 5.5x over the last decade."
2021-04-10 19:51:21,wallstreetbets,And just to reiterate there is no fundamental decay produced by [leverage](https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/1864191-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-decay-of-leveraged-etfs)

2021-04-10 18:10:24,wallstreetbets,">There are 3 main universities fighting for the patent.

It's worth mentioning that Feng Zhang and Jennifer Doudna (enemies in the patent battle) are BOTH co-founders of Editas. If $EDIT wins, lots of parties win."

2021-04-10 18:18:03,wallstreetbets,Why edit vs beam or crsp? Just curious how sure you are they’re going to pull away
2021-04-10 17:28:16,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. These startups will act similar to moderna. Their stocks rise slightly for a long period of time before signs of being profitable (I.e. their drug pipelines near the finish of clinical trials) pop up then the stock explodes upwards. 

It’s even in a juicy dip rn. I’ll buy some leaps after GME."

2021-04-10 18:45:52,wallstreetbets,I work with CRISPR and it is absolutely fantastic for research. The clinical use all depends on the ability of controlling off-target effects. Ethics comes in also but that is for other things not strictly disease therapeutics (see the Chinese story of the crispr twins edited to gain resistance to HIV). I was extremely surprised that Zhang did not get the Nobel prize but he might get the upper hand on the patent battle.

ARKG is a safer play, this is a riskier play."

2021-04-10 18:45:07,wallstreetbets,More info on the patent consensus? Does that mean edit profits off crisp? What’s the deal with beam? They license edit tech right?

2021-04-10 17:58:36,wallstreetbets,Crispr9 has infinite potential for good or evil invest. Got in at 40. There’s such a big underground following
2021-04-10 18:15:11,wallstreetbets,"I think you're right that someone is going to make a killing off this technology. But the legal battles now and any that arise in the future put a big question mark on who exactly is going to make a killing. That link you provided about the ""consensus"" that $EDIT will get the patent doesn't really say that. Also, it's unclear to what extent different variations of CRISPR technology will be patentable, you can't just patent ""CRISPR"" and be done with it. That would be like patenting all drugs that act on the brain or some other broad class of therapy. I think of CRSPR as a class of therapies and it's too soon to say who's got the best/profitable variations."
2021-04-10 17:11:54,wallstreetbets,I will fill my 💎👏 with shares

I’d say the technicals look bearish. That of course, could change pretty quickly with the upcoming conference.

2021-04-10 17:56:44,wallstreetbets,"Crispr was my single largest gain ever on a stock, like 45% in a week. But everyone can use a phone, everyone can use the internet. It would be dystopian for everyone to need or voluntarily use gene editing."

2021-04-10 19:35:01,wallstreetbets,That’s fine and dandy and all. But I think most here are all in on either gme or amc. After these two stocks either boom or bust is when your going to see people looking for great opportunities. So just keep that in mind. We don’t want your hard work to be lost.

2021-04-10 16:59:43,wallstreetbets,I totally agree. It's honestly an understatement that crispr will impact just about every aspect of our lives in the future.
2021-04-10 18:04:23,wallstreetbets,"Great question! So this was going to be my next post. CRSP currently has the most drug in their pipeline, and partnerships of the 3 (CRSP/NTLA/EDIT). But, this isn't taking into account the royalty rights from the patent which I believe the BROAD Institute (EDIT) will win. The patent winner will collect an 8%-13% royalty off of any drug developed through crispr. Royalties have a huge revenue potential because other companies are spending their own money on R&D, and running clinical trials."

2021-04-10 17:55:53,wallstreetbets,I agree. Biotech is a beast in of itself. What I find so interesting about their business model is the royalties. I can't really think of another biotech play that will get revenue in a similar way. The patent has a lot of value.

2021-04-10 19:05:53,wallstreetbets,"Great question. EDIT presented at a hematology conference back in December, and there was a lot of hype. Cathie Woods made an additional comment about crispr which sent all of the crispr stocks into overdrive. EDIT did issue new shares priced at $66, and nearly all growth stocks have been hammered the past couple of months. Biotech is highly volatile. I think it can go back there it's just going to depend on the right catalyst."
2021-04-10 18:29:05,wallstreetbets,CRSP does not hold the patent for cripsr. CRSP was founded by Emmanuelle Charpentier who is one of the parties that is trying to acquire the patent.

2021-04-10 18:27:51,wallstreetbets,"You're right in pointing both out. You cannot patent crispr as crispr. But, you can patent the use of crispr in humans which is what they're fighting over. So the consensus I've been finding is around the BROAD Institute (Harvard/MIT). This will ultimately come down to lab notebooks, and testimony from grad students who worked on it in the past. It's definitely a gamble because it's really difficult to predict who will win in a court case. Especially with this many players involved. I agree someone will make a killing off of this."

2021-04-10 17:33:51,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! I've mainly stuck with biotech, and it kind of operates in a class of its own. Because research costs can be high, and there's little way of knowing how trials are going it's not uncommon for it to have a bearish pattern for a while. Especially with companies in early stages of clinical trials. I think the major catalyst will be the patent. I'm currently going through all of the annual reports for every company that has a licensing agreement with one of the 3 companies to try to find out exactly how much all of them are worth. That one will probably be the last DD post just because the amount of time I'm spending researching it."

2021-04-10 17:19:10,wallstreetbets,"This is actually a very good question. So currently CRSP has a decent amount of partnerships right now. Pre-patent award CRSP is in the best place cash wise, and they have the most ongoing trials. All 3 of them have a business model that relies on licensing the patent. The winner is set to collect more in royalties than their own drugs they produce. I believe EDIT will win it based off of statements from lawyers familiar with the case, and statements from the BROAD Institute."

I feel that someone can just tweak the Cas9 protein or even discover a similar protein and they could be deemed different enough to get around a patent, just like what happens with drugs all the time.

I don't buy that a court would let a company patent any use of CRISPR-associated guide RNAs, especially because CRISPR/guide RNA production is already commercially available."

But if you are looking for an entry with the attitude of “all biotech was bearish last week” without knowing exactly what you are getting into, chances that when your catalyst hits your holding a bag.

2021-04-10 19:24:49,wallstreetbets,"I came here to say exactly this, and people who are downvoting you probably don't know the first thing about the technology. Even OP agrees with you.

They are NOT patenting CRISPR technology itself, just one type of it, for one application (CRISPR-Cas9 for usage in cells that have a nucleus).

For the non-biomedically inclined apes out there: the patent is over which vegetables youre allowed to cut with a knife, not the knife itself.

I think the post is misleading because it implies the former, though it clearly comes from a place of passion and knowledge.  

Found an interesting article [here](https://www.fbrice.com.au/ip-news-insights/who-owns-crispr-cas9-nobel-prize-in-chemistry-stokes-patent-dispute/) that explains what this is all about. It indicates there are other Cas's being put into development already...

I.e. even if they patent cas-9, there is nothing stopping someone from making a CRISPR Cas-Dipshit model that works 10x better and is half as expensive.

Fuck up my karma too if you disagree."

Patented living organism yo. There are tons in agriculture, I use about 20.

Some of these aren't any different from natural organisms excluding a marker gene for the patent. E.g. I breed oyster mushrooms to eat cigarette butts. To patent that I need to add an identifying marker since it isn't a genetic trait, rather learned behavior of the oyster mushroom."

I've been following this for 5 years, and plan on posting an update for when the next case will be held at least a month beforehand. The reason why it has lasted so long is because the patent is held by universities who will collect a royalty. They've been fighting with each other because billions of dollars worth of royalties over the next 14 years are on the line."

I'm sure biotechnology has space for different companies. And there are always possible mergers. Anyway, I see it as a long play. If it works out, nice.

2021-04-10 19:08:57,wallstreetbets,"Yeah man! There’s a lot you can do on Robinhood people don’t take advantage of. My favorite are bull spreads - which is buying 1 call and selling one at a higher strike (price) for the same date. So for example with EDIT I selected to buy 4/16 45c’s and selected to sell 4/16 55c’s which I only had to pay $30 per contract to have a max gain of $1,000. Helps leverage down the risk of playing options while still having a huge upside potential!"

I guess I should have been more specific about how rather than making a broad statement. I'm typically found by searching ""controversial"" in threads so I'm used to it as well. This is my own biggest critique of Reddit. I think any counterpoint should be just as easily seen."
2021-04-10 18:34:08,wallstreetbets,"You're right, and I'm wary about claims like that myself. The comment about ""this will change everything"" is more, or less talking about the broad nature of it. So a big one will be agriculture. DowDupont currently has filed the most patents involving crispr so the use of crispr in food is definitely approaching. In terms of rare diseases it wont fix all, but it will fix some of them. 1 in 10 Americans suffer from a rare disease. Not all of these are genetic based, or are applicable to crispr. But, say 10% of those are it could help a decent amount of people in the next decade."

PLTR has to either go up or down. I don’t see sideways as an option for this stock when a catalyst hits, it always has a 5-10% move at least"

2021-04-10 16:56:18,wallstreetbets,99% sure they will print
2021-04-10 19:27:50,wallstreetbets,I am clenching my butt cheeks with my Tsla 700 calls expiring at 16/4 as well. Tesla is being a bitch lately
2021-04-10 18:09:04,wallstreetbets,depends.. if there is a massive run up on monday or not
2021-04-10 17:18:47,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. This stock has been trading sideways for way too long, demo play plus ER on May 5th will hopefully get us out of this zone and back on the road to $30+.

These will print big."

And just in the money calls. Like 20-25$ leaps. 
Those will print heavy too. Cause you’ll be ITM all fucking year And then catalyst after catalyst will just send you up and up. You won’t have to sell early and you can ride the leaps all the way up to the 50-70$ price point we all know and love"
2021-04-10 17:23:21,wallstreetbets,That being said I do have 2 April 22.5$ calls that are ITM as of today lol.

2021-04-10 16:09:40,wallstreetbets,"this is not a 5g stock. This is a boring expensive REIT stock, which was expensive at $220 and remains expensive at $240."

2021-04-10 15:45:09,wallstreetbets,Thanks for validating my AMT purchase last month
2021-04-10 19:28:13,wallstreetbets,"The engineering company I worked for did a lot of work directly for American Tower, Verizon, and AT&T. I can tell you that these companies are putting up thousands upon thousands of new towers and improving existing towers all across the United States year round, non-stop. Massive investments into 5G infrastructure. It's astonishing when you look at the scale of it.. 

I think Crown Castle is another good bet as they are involved in the same type of thing."

2021-04-10 16:11:18,wallstreetbets,"This is not necessarily true because of the way 5G works

4G LTE works with one antenna on a high elevation to splash a signal over a large area.


5G works with many low power antennas on midsize buildings (fire stations, apartment complexes). So the antennas will most likely not be using towers.

I think the best bet is to invest in barium mining. That is what the 5G antennas will be made of."

Good job, OP. Might get into AMT and treat it more like a portion of my portfolio to store some cash that would be otherwise sitting useless in my bank account."
2021-04-10 17:11:39,wallstreetbets,"Any info on ERIC working with them?  Ericsson is my pick for the actual 5G technology part of this, they've got hundreds of contacts already"
2021-04-10 18:39:32,wallstreetbets,"CCI is a better play, since they specialize in small 5G towers, while AMT does not."
2021-04-10 16:40:20,wallstreetbets,"The only thing this post is missing is a pic of positions

But damn, a decent DD. Nice to see this here again"
2021-04-10 16:21:09,wallstreetbets,"So why has it been on a steady decline for 6 months? I bought at the top 6 months ago thinking I'll cash in on the 5G boom but it isn't booming at all, no one seems to give a fuck.

I just sold half my shares at a loss, I'll wait until the rest come up enough that I can sell to break even and then forget about AMT assholes"
2021-04-10 17:21:49,wallstreetbets,I can't take a single thing you say seriously you lead with gamestop being a dying company. They just hired like 8 superstars to there super team. Who leaves Google or Amazon to go to a dying company? No one.
2021-04-10 16:12:30,wallstreetbets,"Downside: REITs are required to pay out at least 90% of their net earnings to maintain their status as a security, heavily limiting their ability  to reinvest back into the company for growth. Or I'm wrong. 

Disclosure: I fucking hate REITs"
2021-04-10 16:25:30,wallstreetbets,I saw reit and I checked out... gl op.
2021-04-10 17:33:44,wallstreetbets,"Missed the core problem with why this company is now overvalued.

5G does not rely on towers. The existing towers will remain and localised stations will be utilised, existing poles and wires and buildings. Verizon has modelled this already in in a 5G model city.

If AMT disappeared they would sell their towers - This is a balls up 5G play and I would sooner invest my dollars in NOK before AMT - AMT is going to be the next short squeeze candidate just like GME."
2021-04-10 17:00:40,wallstreetbets,"Too late. Old REIT, growth is slowing, P/AFFO is already high compared to peers. On top of that, REITs are horrendously tax inefficient, which means the only way to reasonably win by investing in it is in a tax advantaged account.

At these prices, it is too late to really win on AMT. My .02."
2021-04-10 17:03:24,wallstreetbets,Why you mix this stock with GME/AMC ?
2021-04-10 16:43:06,wallstreetbets,5G has already come n gone

2021-04-10 16:26:39,wallstreetbets,Good luck with mining stocks then.
2021-04-10 16:52:48,wallstreetbets,I'm aware. I have seen some of the loss posts lol.
2021-04-10 17:24:53,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, if I had to pick a cell provider it would be Verizon. AT&T has too much debt and Verizon seems to be well run by management. Plus Buffett picked up shares recently, which is almost never a bad sign."
2021-04-10 17:28:59,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure on that. I know AMT builds and operates the cell towers, but if Ericsson is a big part of the actual technological hardware of the cell towers, I would assume that they work together."
2021-04-10 17:11:22,wallstreetbets,Just added them. Took me awhile to figure out how to post those two without showing everything else.
2021-04-10 16:32:47,wallstreetbets,You bought it when shares where trading at a premium valuation. No stock goes straight up and to the right. The market does need people like you who buy the short term top and then sell at a loss so the rest of us can feel good about ourselves lol
2021-04-10 17:39:25,wallstreetbets,"Why would Microsoft, Sony, or other producers continue to sell physical games and equipment through GameStop and cut into their margins? All these games can be downloaded directly to the console or PC, and equipment like controllers and headphones can already be shipped directly to customers. 

If you think GameStop can somehow figure out how to make money in this environment, all while shutting down existing stores, issuing shares and bleeding cash, then you drank the Kool Aid. If you believe the GameStop is some great turnaround story though, feel free to keep believing. I don't see it though."
2021-04-10 16:29:32,wallstreetbets,"That’s true, but there are other ways to fund growth than through retained earnings. They can issue shares (actually a benefit for REITs that trade at premium), or debt, or they can recycle properties."
2021-04-10 17:52:31,wallstreetbets,"0.81% short interest, but go ahead if you would rather own Nokia. It was trading at $4 since 1997, with a couple bumps for the dotcom bubble and a peak in 2007 until the iPhone killed their sales, and is now trading at $4 again. AMT and the other tower REITs have small cell locations as part of their operations. Not sure if that is what you are talking about, but AMT and the other tower REITs are not going to get cut out of the 5G network."
2021-04-10 17:17:36,wallstreetbets,"Which is why I own the shares in a Roth. CCI and SBAC both have higher P/AFFO (pulled off of Seeking Alpha), which I can understand since they are smaller. Growth might be slowing, but they are still expanding internationally, which is why I still think there is room to run for AMT. 

I don't think REITs are horrendously tax inefficient. Yes, you have to pay taxes at income bracket instead of qualified dividends for C-Corps, but they don't have any taxes net income and generally pay out larger dividends. I get that they aren't for everybody, but there are some good REITs out there."

No one would give two shits if some small cap tech stock disappeared because those are a dime a dozen, but AMT is an important part of the world’s communication infrastructure. The long term growth potential comes from international expansion and a move into edge data centers. If you are that negative on the future prospects of AMT, buy puts."

Kinder Morgan had a dividend cut, which I try to stay away from because companies that cut dividends tend to underperform, but there are other Midstream companies that I have been buying lately. I do actually like Kroger though. Definitely a good value and looks like the dividend is growing at a decent pace."

2021-04-10 15:09:13,wallstreetbets,"**OTC salad futures:** 

1) schedule massive Amazon Fresh vegetable orders months out. for example, order $50,000 of romaine lettuce (has to be organic and nonorganic) to be delivered June 3rd. 

2) call all of your friends’ parents with refrigerators in their garage and ask to either buy them on the cheap or borrow them them for the month of June. **Do not** explain yourself or they might try to get in on the action and therefore impede your ability to corner the local romaine market.

3) fill your living room with refrigerators but leave them unplugged until delivery

4) wait

5) take delivery and arbitrage back to local grocery stores with enough markup to cover costs and tendies"
2021-04-10 19:11:20,wallstreetbets,"3 major things.    
     
#1.   
Imports are brutally delayed. We get a lot of produce from South America, especially outside of our normal produce season April-December) which mostly comes from WA, OR, ID, CA, AZ. Most imported produce shipped via ocean on container vessels. The demand of empty containers in China far exceeds demand anywhere else in the world right now thanks to WFH culture, Pandemic, and various direct to consumer sales. Most large steamship companies have vessels on the water moving with about 50%-60% of the shipping containers onboard completely empty in order to get them to China and the eastern hemisphere to meet the demand. Right now to get a container from Long Beach to Hong Kong costs around $3k. The other way.. HK to LB is around $8k. Simple supply and demand. There’s a bottle neck of inbound US imports coming from our international suppliers.    
      
#2.     
There’s no produce shortage in the US from domestic supply. However there’s a **VERY** key shortage effecting produce getting on shelves. There is a trucking/driver shortage. Freight rates have escalated drastically in the last 12 months. Some lanes as low as 30% but some lanes as high as 300%. This is effecting produce movement more than anything. The buyers/retailers have been priced in, and so have the growers/shippers/packers. This cost in freight is a constant battle between all parties who’ve been priced in working and planning off low margins for ages. Loads are sitting on docks for days and weeks.     
     
#3.     
Produce season is about to start in CA, AZ, WA, TX, FL and all over the country. All retailers will be promoting local and supplementing from other US regions, and imports will slowly trickle in.    
        
————————————————— 
     
The guy working at Aldi is a retard. The play is logistics and trucking IMO.   
I do a lot of trucking for Aldi, and they just gave us a 25% raise in rates. They’ve been one of the more challenging customers to negotiate raises.. same with Trader Joe’s. We’ve let their shit sit and arrive late quite a bit. Walmart, Safeway, Kroger, HEB, LIDL, Meijer, Publix, Target, Sprouts, and Giant Eagle have all been a lot faster to cough up more dough to meet the spot market freight rates."

Shortages like this don't always mean UNFI will have trouble sourcing, it means the people paying less will have trouble sourcing, i.e., upward inflationary pressure. UNFI is positioned to absolutely clobber future earnings with the help of inflation and their windfall from the lockdown that helped pay down their TruValue purchase debt.

Between earnings and the merging vote...there's going to be quite a bit of news surrounding this.  News of the 'newly formed largest cannbis company' can go far. Renewed news on cannabis=short-term surge (as I see it). 

This has only been going downhill for a bit now, which means rumor creates more people interested, more people buying, and lots of catalysts crammed into a week.

May do a few of each for 5/21, thanks for the thought."
2021-04-10 19:21:30,wallstreetbets,Been eyeing this one for a bit now. Im going to let it fall a bit more and then jump in head first with some shares. I think 2021 or 2022 will be the year of the fintech boom.

2021-04-10 13:02:43,wallstreetbets," 

So My story -

Started in July 2020 with $1.3k( no options) I didn't know what the fuck I was doing

Took a £10k loan in November to buy some internet money-> made about £4/5k and YOLO'ed it all in GME in December/Jan ( sat on 754 shares)

Paper-Handed all 754 shares on ( wait for it) ----> Tuesday eve Jan 26th....( total $108k)

FOMO kicked in the following day-> went back in ..kept buying dips..... paper-handed again in the end and took a $40k loss from previous profits.

Went YOLO again around the time when DFV doubled down.... I keep adding as and when I have a spare $.

**Im not Selling.** **No more Paper Handing.** **~~I Stand Retarded~~**\*\*. I Stand United. I Hold. And I Buy.\*\*

Overall- Currently @$99k profits..

( GME 887 -> average about $110)

ATH profit -> $193k in March 2021

2021-04-10 19:09:27,wallstreetbets,"$120 was the previous floor before it shot up again, honestly think floor now is around the $140-150 mark before things shoot up again back into the $200+ range again."

2021-04-10 14:42:49,wallstreetbets,Id be happy to see gme go to 1k+ lol. I just really don’t see it happening anymore
2021-04-10 14:45:04,wallstreetbets,That's fine. I do. On fundamentals alone. No squeeze required
2021-04-10 14:55:41,wallstreetbets,"THANK YOU! So many shithead boomer talking shit about GME on this sub. Only thing theyre saying is ""Have fun bagholding"" or ""The squeeze already happened"" without any arguments at all, and when they bring up some and get disproven, they just go back to ""Have fun bagholding"". So tired of this shit and this sub."
2021-04-10 15:04:48,wallstreetbets,"Lol, you apes literally ignore and dismiss any reasonable arguments. Why try anymore."
2021-04-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GME past, present, and (possible) future Greetings apes. This DD compares several different time frames of GME's past price and volume to now to show similarities, where we currently are in relation to historical prices, and where we could go. This is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor.

EDIT: before you read this, this is NOT a prediction, this is just a comparison of the past to now to show where we COULD be going. Stock price action often repeats itself but this is not a guarantee or prediction by any means.

**The big view**

This chart gives you an overview of the time frames I will be comparing. I will first be comparing the red and green squares to show that they are extremely similar in price action and volume. After that, I will be analyzing the blue square to demonstrate where we could be going in the next days/weeks based on the fact that the red and green squares share extremely similar price and volume action:

&#x200B;

**Where we've been vs. where we are (red and green square comparison):**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j63mfo013ds61.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=943e3bb6a0bb9d4a400315b26fb504da87de33c6

https://preview.redd.it/ruqqmrmz2ds61.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4ac0ba2ec4ea3108947c311435f86a920325444

**Color-coded explanation for the above two charts:**

https://preview.redd.it/3hc8za4p3ds61.png?width=1478&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ed2a48f4ac2b7514bcc166dadfac4178109dc2d

As you can see, the similarities are uncanny. The volume patterns are identical, the two peaks follow the same pattern, the first peak is lower than the second but has higher volume, the second peak is immediately followed by a rapid drop in price, and the reaction to earnings and eventual recovery are extremely similar.

**Where we could be going**

The below chart is the blue square in the large-view chart. This represents where we could be going in the coming days/weeks based on the fact that the red and green squares that I compared are extremely similar. It follows that because the red and green squares are so similar and this blue square follows the red square, we could see similar price action to this square in the future. This indicates that we still have a few more days/weeks to go before the actual squeeze but that we should see a substantial increase in price very soon. Is this a guarantee? Not at all! This is simply using past data to make a prediction about the future. We very well could see the squeeze sooner or later than what this predicts!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j1l3h0hd4ds61.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=a88a66388e592b46edf741512b6dec1a3e6fc69c

There you have it! According to historical similarities in GME's price movements, we are in for a substantial increase in price in the coming days, we will then see a consolidation period, we will then see a monstrous jump followed by a slight consolidation, then the squeeze will take us to tendie town. The differences in these squares are that (obviously) the current price is about 10x higher than the previous price, however, they still follow a similar pattern. Though the price action is similar, this current pattern (green) seems to be moving quicker than the past pattern (red). If, in the coming days/weeks, GME's price and volume are similar to the blue square, that indicates that we should be on deck for the MOASS and, because the current price is substantially higher than the past price, this squeeze will be SIGNIFICANTLY larger in price. Again, do not take this as a fact, this simply uses historical price and volume to give a picture of where we COULD be going.

**TL;DR**

The current GME volume and price action follows pre-January trends extremely similarly. Using the past to predict the future, we should see a substantial jump soon followed by consolidation, followed by a monstrous jump, followed by consolidation, and then the tendie squeeze. Again, this is not a guarantee, this is a potential scenario based on past similarities to know."

2021-04-10 14:04:48,wallstreetbets,Thanks for giving us your time :)
2021-04-10 17:54:13,wallstreetbets,"Hedge funds got caught off guard last time. This time you can bet they have some intern assigned full time to read WSB and gauge retail sentiment. I'm sure they are shorting when price is > $200, hedging by retaining a few shares, and then selling covered and uncovered calls to keep some weekly income flowing in. Everyone here seems to forget these guys are pros. They got caught off guard once. Good luck doing it again. Our best bet would be to ""trap"" them with a slow decline like we have now so they feel confident going heavier in their shorts, and then a quick turn around. Problem is retail is capped out for capital to buy meaningfully more GME at these prices IMHO."
2021-04-10 11:42:52,wallstreetbets,Ya believe the earth is flat mate? Short interest does not tell the whole story. Its possible this stock is MORE shorted today that it was in January. Check out ETFs with GME and ask yourself if short interest is at 15/20%
2021-04-10 12:42:05,wallstreetbets,"Oh please. Face the facts homie, how did all the original shorts actually cover if they shorted all the way down? It’s impossible, the price was & is still too high. A lot of them closed & we saw that rise when they did it. If they are still way over the float & can’t cover, we will see the massive price up on a close. 

The buying demand is there & with the share recall we are about to see if ‘the cultist’ are right or you are right. Whoever turns out to be right, I’m proud of the resistance being shown & this is still a historic shituation.

Lastly, this whole thing has really pissed me off. I buy out of spite now & still way way up. The fact of the matter is, GME can be the new TSLA darling with the type of resistance & support we are seeing. Does it last, who knows? So far though, the staying power is there. 

This play was WSB YOLO of a lifetime to get rich af. It has worked for many. The fact people like you & others want to dog the spirit of this play has intrenched me, & others.

Defeat is not an option now & every time I see a news story how it is over & other false media stories. I will just bag hold more, too bad I know how to hedge & everything is fine. Suck my dick.

2021-04-10 17:57:03,wallstreetbets,Exactly short term investing is a zero sum game. For someone to win someone else has to lose. Early on the HF lost and retail gained. The HF have changed strategy and retail is doing the same thing. It's obvious to anyone with half a brain how this is going to end unless retail also changes its strategy to counter.

That being said, I CAN'T STAND HOW MUCH GME FLAT BRAIN TALK HAPPENS. 

***Shorting based on:***

**- Management didn't properly take advantage of the squeeze to increase their balance sheet.** 

**- It's a cyclical stock and steam is running out.** 

**- The squeeze ALREADY happened.** 

**- Those who took profits, aren't buying back unless it dips way more due to human psychology of the ape.**

Practically that's very unlikely - they only managed to recover by 20% two months ago and lost 7% last month. Either one is an ungodly swing for a HF, so they're obviously trying very hard. 

The trouble is that GME is insanely volatile right now, so while the theoretical gains are astronomical no matter what happens, the risk is just as high."

Not only that, they have way more capital, experience, and the world's top battery engineers.

I understand what you are saying though. I would have never invested in GME. The only reason I did, was how cult-ish GME gang was turning. Reminded me of TESLA in 2018. One thing I learned in my time investing is never bet against a cult trend and don't underestimated retard strength.

My biggest gains have always been from companies with a cult-ish following. Apple, Tesla, and now GME."

2021-04-10 11:34:53,wallstreetbets,Probably $25 in fractional shares. Was probably $50 when he bought.
2021-04-10 11:36:54,wallstreetbets,I hold a large number of stock in GME since early/mid January. It could drop to $40 and I’d still profit a large sum. We’ll see how this plays out in a month.
2021-04-10 12:29:03,wallstreetbets,"oh you mean where they said they were extending an *already existing agreement to sell stock*, just upping the price point to a $285/share evaluation?

Sorry I didn't realize that means 'we're immediately selling stock', cause it definitely doesn't

you also seemed to miss the part in the 10k where they listed over 600 million in cash, which is more than double their current debt obligation.

How do you figure they can't pay off their debts, when they literally have double the money required already?"
2021-04-10 15:57:40,wallstreetbets,This comment will age like your name

I cashed out in January."
2021-04-10 15:52:43,wallstreetbets,So fucking what?
2021-04-10 14:56:17,wallstreetbets,Proof or ban.
2021-04-10 12:44:20,wallstreetbets,"Yes, that one. Doesn't matter if they *could* have diluted previously, they didn't. Now they probably will. All the words in the world won't change the fact that

* They have said they will probably struggle to meet their debt obligations
* They have said they may need to raise additional capital and will have trouble originating new debt
* Digital transformation is expensive, they need more cash on top of that

They're gonna issue new shares *at market price*, and that's bad for the share price. Have fun holding through that!"
2021-04-10 16:31:28,wallstreetbets,"Like wine?  So it will age well?  So now you're agreeing with me that you won't have internet access in a year?

2021-04-10 13:04:27,wallstreetbets,"They did not say they’re struggling to pay back their debt?

That was not mentioned at all in the 10k

They stated multiple times that they’re nowhere close to bankruptcy. Good luck on your short positions."
2021-04-10 17:18:35,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that was my joke, who's the retard? lol. Mabye take some time off reddit, you seem a bit vile"
2021-04-10 16:04:11,wallstreetbets,"LOL!  You're the one concern trolling somebody for posting something that doesn't go along with the memestonk retard circle jerk.  

You lack self awareness."
2021-04-10 14:41:46,wallstreetbets,"GME are cash rich, and have only 300 million in debt, with 600 million in cash or something similar.   Why would they rush to pay off their debt?  Unlocking the 3.5 million shares even adds more cash to their war chest.  Don't know where the guy that you are replying to is getting his info from, but definitely something is fishy with his source of information."
2021-04-10 15:51:54,wallstreetbets,"You somehow missed those huge sections talking about how their lender was going to reduce their credit by 10% this summer and their 2023 bond indenture prevented them from raising revenue by any other means?

2021-04-10 15:06:11,wallstreetbets,"First off, they have 1.2B in debt. Send off, here's a *direct quote from their 10k*:

>To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations or refinance our debt on favorable terms.

>Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, including without limitation any payments required to be made under our revolving credit facility or to holders of our 2023 Senior Notes, and to fund our operations, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, including interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, including the 2023 Senior Notes, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. We cannot provide assurance that any refinancing would be possible, that any assets could be sold, or, if sold, of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales, that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all, or if that additional financing would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments, then in effect.

>Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, including the 2023 Senior Notes, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis, would have an negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

2021-04-10 16:25:35,wallstreetbets,"Yes, did you?

You seem to have missed the right numbers on debt, and the amounts they were holding in cash. Ie. Key figures showing they aren’t going bankrupt any time soon"
2021-04-10 16:12:42,wallstreetbets,Of course I do...I'm not a memestonk retard trying to get rich quick with a joke stonk *months* after the scam is done and gone.

So somehow you believe they acquired an extra 900 million of debt from February to end of March 2021?

Where do you see the 1.2 billion in debt figures?  Source please.

2021-04-10 16:28:39,wallstreetbets,"Are they struggling to pay back their debt?  Yes.  That's further complicated by the reduction in their revolving credit fund, the limitations imposed by the bond indenture, and also things like the tax they'll owe on the 300,000 RSUs that are vesting this spring, which is impossible to determine until the rights actually vest (but the higher the share price, the more Gamestop has to pay - ha!).

There is so much more going on with that company than just a couple of lines on a simple balance sheet.  Apes don't care, so let's just agree to disagree."

I'd hate to have you as my landlord.  

So if you are a landlord, and you sign a 10 year lease to your tenant(s), do you expect your tenant to pay all of that 10 year lease up front?   You sound like that is something you expect or think is common practice.  It was classed under Costs of Sales.    

Do you expect GameStop to pay all of their leases until the expiry date up front, even if the contract doesn't end for like 10 years?  You are seeing these now as debts?, for something that hasn't been used yet or benefitted from."
2021-04-10 17:11:28,wallstreetbets,">I'd hate to have you as my landlord.

Listen, do you hear that? That's the sound of me not giving a fuck *what* you prefer. If you're *my* tenant, you either pay your rent or I kick your ass out on the street. Welcome to adult life. For GME, that means they *have* to pay it or else they go out of business.

AITA for hoping that happens? Literally could not care less."
2021-04-10 17:13:31,wallstreetbets,"You do understand Costs of Sales?  

You seem to think that Rent Paid, is a debt.  It's an operational expense, to aid sales.  

So yes or no, do you expect businesses to pay their entire lease upfront at the start, or in recurring payments on, maybe, a monthly basis, over the length of that lease?

Was someone naked shorting stocks for the big boys to try and impress them so he's finally let in on the big boy conversations? [SEC 13-F filings and stock price data analysis] [Evidence-backed DD] Hey guys,

**by now we have all seen the headlines, Melvin Capital supposedly closes Q1 with a 49% loss:**

&#x200B;

Of course, whether that's true or not remains to be seen, but I have just spent half an hour inputting stock price changes into Melvin's portfolio, and **if it's true, IT'S REAL BAD.**

Apart from being **a fraudulent short seller**, Mr. Melvin is actually a pretty shrewd investor.

For the period ending 31 DEC, he reported to the SEC a **Portfolio Value of $22,639,690,000** across 77 positions, opening 5 new ones, and closing 36 positions. Mister Melvin sold a lot of profitable calls and stock at the start of this and previous quarter (at first glance), so it's also likely he is sitting on a sizeable cash reserve. But that's not the crux of this analysis.

&#x200B;

**In this report for 31 DEC 2020, Mr. Melvin reports holding $19,787,325,000 LONG in the following stocks:**

Do we know if that is realized or unrealized? $10b @ $100 loss a share (assuming they averaged up with their shorts) would be 100 million shares of gme if it was all gme losses. Some of that might have been written calls too? Or options expiring worthless? Maybe also interest payments? Any idea how many shares this could potentially be? Even if half the loss is from options and interest that would be $50m shares in Melvin alone. That is more than the float. 

If Citidel decided they had to bail them out, how many more are there?"

I’m trying to do the math based on the 12.5 billion AUM + 2.75 billion from Citsdel/Point 72 plus the reported monthly performance of -53% January, +21.7% February, and -7% March and it isn’t adding up to -49% Q1.

Once Melvins customers hear that he took a 49% loss how many of them are gonna pull their money out to go with another investment company? 

This could not only be a massive loss by itself but could cause a further massive loss as customers take their cash elsewhere leaving Melvin with less money to use for making money.

Edit: people are telling me the cash is locked in for a minimum period and can't be withdrawn yet. That's disappointing, ah well it was nice a nice thought while it lasted."

2021-04-10 14:02:53,wallstreetbets,"Nino Brown would still be running the projects if he saw why that old man was a threat.

If I understand:


Velocity and/or liquidity impacts can be mitigated — we saw that with the infusion and accompanying press release.

The pain is taking on exponential risk for outsized rewards by going outside the approved system.

It can make what you have not enough to survive, happen too fast for anyone to help you, or become too toxic to remain protected. 

The little bit of advantage you have evaporates with pride, the illusion of control, and by being beholden to others that have requirements for you to operate which you can’t or won’t meet.

Its self inflicted, makes you vulnerable and becomes what kills you because you’re a liability that threatens what you do not fully comprehend.

Even if you survive - you lose because while you can exist at a different level, you know there’s tiers above you that can’t be accessed. Success becomes a prison.

LSS: Every mob movie ever.

The play is forcing protective actions which preserve the larger system. If the threat is real — at some point loyalty shifts : it’s in one’s best interest to close exploitable loopholes rather than continue to protect them.

If the methods deployed were truly superior, they’d be incorporated into the system, not exist outside it.

When that happens, some currently untouchable players will become casualties through systemic shifts in risk tolerance. Their toxic brands either can’t adapt, be rehabilitated, be trusted or they simply can no longer perform at the required levels.

This is the way.

But what do I know... 🦍🍌💎"

When MOASS happens, does the above information constitute for a large probability that these other companies Mr. Melvin is invested in will take a huge hit?

2021-04-10 19:00:00,wallstreetbets,Isn't it much more than $10bill loss? If long holdings were up from 19.7b to 21.3b or 7.62% and overall the fund was down 49% that would take total holding from 41.8b to 21.3b at a minimum. So at a minimum that would take other holding start at 22b and drop to 0. So a $22 billion loss?

2021-04-10 12:15:01,wallstreetbets,"I guess the question is that 20 billion in long positions could be counterbalanced by their debits, like loans and short positions.  Companies don't just short companies in a vacuum; they are taking the money from that and investing it in a long position.

The number of long positions they hold leads me to believe that,

* They have shorted a large number of companies for cash
* The people they are borrowing from also have long and short positions in the same companies.

If Melvin has to sell, the other HF would also lose.  It becomes a team game at that point.  It is hard to say, given what they have put out, how much Melvin is actually worth at this point."

2021-04-10 15:05:45,wallstreetbets,"I've done the math and got it to balance. Here's how I worked it, and how I think the figures are being reported.

The figures for loss year to date are against the $12.5 billion at the beginning of 2021. The $2.75 billion ~~bail out~~ investment doesn't show as profit or loss for the YTD figures.

The monthly increase includes the $2.75 billion in the baseline for the month beginning.

Worked this way, 53% down at the end of January and 49% down at the end of March is based on $12.5 billion at January 1st and is the amount of loss as %. 

22% increase in February is based on over $8 billion at the beginning of February, and the 7% drop in March is based on the end of February amount.

Please check independently (hence my not giving my sums) and let me know if they balance for you.

I'm also curious how they can have a $20 billion long position and only show $12.5 billion at the beginning of the year?"

He’s expecting the stock to go below AND stay below 130 (which is when he can exercise the contract) by 5/21. Basically a retard’s move

Whoever sold that contract, if OP chooses to exercise, the seller will have to buy 100xcontract shares from OP at the strike price, no matter how far below the price is from 130."

2021-04-10 14:22:46,wallstreetbets,"Friendly question here, but I’m not understanding the math. How is your sheet showing MA as a -0.25% return when the price from December to March increased by $8.50? Same thing for TEAM, V, NUAN, MSCI, and to be honest I stopped counting at that point—March prices all increased from what your sheet’s showing from December, but your % Gain column is showing a loss. 

For MA, your sheet states a December 31 total value of $1,108,856,000, but simple math (3,106,561 x $347.55) says the total value should have been $1,079,685,275.55 as of December 31. My guess is that the value stated in the report is based on a share price from a different date than December 31, or the number of shares held has changed, but I wanted your take on why the math seems off on a lot of these?"
2021-04-10 14:09:49,wallstreetbets,load it up on google sheets and make it open to public

Plus the service is amazing. We were coming back from Scotland and the plane was cancelled the night before, like it was grounded in North America for maintenance. She messaged us as we were getting ready for sleep. ""Don't bother waking up at 6 AM, I already booked you on the 11AM flight, btw since the flight is delayed more than 4 hours I'm going to go ahead and send the compensation forms, you should each get a cheque for €400 in a few weeks"". And sure as shit we did. That covered more than 50% of our fare. Let me tell you she has clients for life."
2021-04-10 15:09:46,wallstreetbets,"It's also possible to get a better price on an OTA, so worth checking both.

For most major chains, the current status quo is that everyone is tracking rate parity, so there generally aren't huge variations in run of the house rooms.

Sometimes OTAs have block rates, and they might discount if they haven't sold their block.

There are also packaged rates which are sometimes substantially cheaper, but can only be sold with an opaque price as part of a package booking.  Hotels allow these rates to be sold when they know they're not sold out, and are willing to accept less, but don't want to erode their pricing structure for last minute travelers."

2021-04-10 16:11:49,wallstreetbets,"True. But, come on, you’ve seen the recent call posts. Those IVs are paying huge on healthy volume with good support; it’s pretty remarkable to watch actually. If I wasn’t leveraged to the tits on GME, I might be tempted to buy some calls."

2021-04-10 14:49:53,wallstreetbets,"I mean if we take a look at Cramer's book when these guys took a long position in these companies, they probably also shorted similar stocks in the same category to make it seem like the other companies are taking a nose dive while your newly bought company is shining bright - I mean, obviously you gotta throw some fomenting in there, too 😉, but you already know that because we TOTALLY didn't see some guy post a loser video saying Gamestop would be going back to $40 about, what, two weeks before it hit $480? I mean I guess he was technically right that it did go back to $40... Before rocketing up to $180 then $330.

So when they're taking losses in some of their long positions, or even only making marginal gains, it might be plausible to say that any shorts they have going on that long's competition is not working for them."

2021-04-10 17:26:24,wallstreetbets,"They can do what they want with their money but I personally dont think its too smart to give it to a hedge fund, when most hedge funds fail to outperform the s&p after fees. Its basically nothing more than a scam, case in point, a lot of hedge funds failed to hedge for the march crash."
2021-04-10 18:37:43,wallstreetbets,"Depends on how much diversification. If you diversify too much then s&p will do better. If you know what youre doing, buying 5-10 stocks will be better than getting 30."

It really isn’t that bad and I get stellar stays. Been doing this gig 25 years now and works spectacularly.

> Is that to avoid the perception of having a monopoly?

This is one benefit.

> Branding?

No. All of these brands are *different* brands from Expedia. If Expedia Group wanted to improve Expedia's ""branding"", they would consolidate all these into one brand. In other words, all these sites would *redirect* to Expedia, or all the other site logos would have ""an Expedia company"" by them. Expedia doesn't do any of these things, so Expedia doesn't gain brand recognition by owning all of these other websites. They have consolidated some brands into others, for example [they expired the HomeAway brand into VRBO last year](https://www.vrbo.com/media-center/press-releases/2020/expedia-group-retires-homeaway-u-s-brand-to-focus-on-vrbo-and-streamline-its).

> Different customer segmentation and value propositions?

In some cases yes. VRBO's main value prop is domestic, rent a cabin for a week kind of thing. But the rest are all super-similar: Vacation to another country where you need a flight + car + lodging.

**The main reason for a multi-brand strategy is simple: market share.** If you ask a thousand people what's their #1 favorite website to book a vacation, and Expedia gets 20%, Orbitz gets 20%, Hotels.com gets 20%, VRBO gets 10%, Travelocity gets 10%, then Expedia Group actually has 80% market share.

Customers have the illusion of ""shopping around"", but they're not. Part of the engineering effort during these acquisitions is to update the acquired brand's website so that it calls the Expedia Group shared APIs for pricing data, hotel availability, etc. In other words, once Expedia Group brings a new brand under their umbrella, they get rid of duplicated pricing and availability code, but keep the UI of the acquired brand.

> Did Expedia start them all or just buy up competitors to their main business?

They [bought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedia_Group#Mergers_and_acquisitions) *all* of the other brands."
2021-04-10 16:01:07,wallstreetbets,"it’s a common strategy. The idea is if you hate hotels.com, you use expedia. you hate expedia, you use vrbo. People like you and me are too dumb to lookup who owns these sites"

It might happen 2022 summer if vaccines don't cause a reopening 2021, so as always, timing is difficult.  Hotels make the majority of their revenues in the summer."

2021-04-10 17:13:15,wallstreetbets,i was using hotwire for years until this.  i'll still use them i like the random hotel aspect lol... but damn i was using them to avoid expedia
2021-04-10 17:30:26,wallstreetbets,What’s extra annoying is that using the Travelocity credit card on Expedia doesn’t give bonus points :( (or maybe vice versa).
2021-04-10 14:31:12,wallstreetbets,"because using Expedia as the example; it is currently priced above pre-pandemic levels. 
Tourism is going to take years to pick itself back up, unwinding the virus prevention measures isn’t something that it going to happen overnight

edit: the best example of this madness is cruise stocks"
2021-04-10 14:33:35,wallstreetbets,"Well i dont really think Expedia depends much on their tourist sector, when were talking stock price, cause right now its near its all time high, while there is a global pandemic going on..."
2021-04-10 14:46:06,wallstreetbets,"That doesn’t mean it’s worth 50% more than it was pre-pandemic. Between 12/31/19 to 12/31/20, Expedia’s long-term debt doubled from $4B to $8B, AR is down to $701M from $2.5B, cash was flat at about $3.3B, but deferred revenue equals $3.2B which will eat into a lot of their cash position. Even if travel spikes, they’re in a far worse position now than in 2019"
2021-04-10 14:35:55,wallstreetbets,"things don’t just open back up though. we are still in the middle of this pandemic and everyone is so keen to open up the economy again (i completely understand why) that we invite more complications.

2021-04-10 14:40:54,wallstreetbets,"what’s the additional cost of servicing that vacation? health and safety, regulatory capacity requirements, keeping things clean, PPE for staff, countries that still black listing for fears of another spread?"

2021-04-10 16:46:12,wallstreetbets,I don't think the hotel industry is gonna crash. They cater to different crowds now. Airbnb use to be an alternative to expensive hotels. But recently the price of Airbnb stays has really increased to match those hotel rooms. The only things Airbnb has going for it now is certain out of the way locations and facilities inside the homes themselves.

2021-04-10 14:58:56,wallstreetbets,As someone who lives in a place where tourism is the largest part of our states economy I can tell you for a fact tourism is booming again. Even more visitors coming now than we had pre pandemic.
2021-04-10 14:38:40,wallstreetbets,"I live in Fort Lauderdale and flights and hotels have been booked for months and are booked for months out.

2021-04-10 14:37:27,wallstreetbets,"This is absolutely ill-logical take. Once Americans get vaccinated it's going to be the roaring 20s. You see how crowded bars/restaurants are right now with all the ""restrictions?"" Now imagine when over 50% of the country is vaccinated. People are going to book fucking everything.

Tourism, consumer spending, luxury brands will be the safest fucking bets this year.

Tourism isn't going to take years, maybe international tourism but if you don't think they'll be deals between industrialized countries to share vaccines and allow inter state travel you're delusional.

Only business travel will be taking a massive hit and while that does make up a large portion of hotels/airline travel, certain companies will be fine with the transition. Companies like Expedia and AirBnB."
2021-04-10 14:56:58,wallstreetbets,That’s because stock holders understand that the value of money is less. Government is lying about inflation.
2021-04-10 15:05:46,wallstreetbets,"I think you're wrong about this. As soon as a sizable portion of the country is vaccinated, overnight everything will open up because 1. everyone is tired of pandemic life and 2. people want to make money.

Like it or not, safety isn't really that important to most people. I bet even before summer everything will be booming with business and no one will be wearing masks or social distancing. It's hard enough now to get most people to do it NOW, you think once >50% of the population is vaccinated they're going to be cautious and open slowly? Fuck no, the damn is going to break."

I’m no doctor or virologist, and I think my family did a good job of respecting the lockdown measures.

2021-04-10 18:22:25,wallstreetbets,"AI driving is more of the problem.  Hotels are expensive to run and margins are like 5%.  What you're going to see is people just sitting in their cars and going straight to the destination cities.  Now, a lot of hotels are actually highway locations on the outskirts of destination cities.  Those hotels will fall and failing hotels brings the brand down.

Watch all the big brands like IHG.  They're all releasing new brands.  IHG has Avid coming out that they've been trying to squeeze into new builds.  Hilton is coming out with their Tru line, Choice has Ascend.  Why are they diluting their brands like Holiday Inn or Comfort Inn that already has tons of recognition?  Because those brands *could* be in jeopardy of hotels along the highway start failing because people don't feel the need to stop.

The hotel industry probably won't fail, but it'll be pushed to destination cities and the big brands are already preparing for that possibility when they have to abandon their Holiday Inn linr."

Also it's so hard to even reserve anything here as there are capacity restrictions lower than what FL biz ops might have. But thing is, only reason why FL has seen good tourism is the ""fuck it, we will stay open no matter what"" attitude. Benefits it short term, but well yeah it will die down."
2021-04-10 15:49:18,wallstreetbets,Wow you people really know nothing about anything lol
2021-04-10 15:03:15,wallstreetbets,Gotta love Florida. Not taking anymore BULLSHIT.
2021-04-10 16:47:25,wallstreetbets,"I’m curious as to who has ever heard of Oxnard, CA, let alone who goes there for vacation."
2021-04-10 16:32:26,wallstreetbets,Yeah so it sounds like there isn't much room for growth and those trying to get in won't see big changes. This would've been a good buy back in September or October.
2021-04-10 15:03:29,wallstreetbets,i dont live in America and that story is not shared around the globe.
2021-04-10 16:51:21,wallstreetbets,"I can attest to this. I drove up and down Baja California a week ago. Cities like Loreto, La Paz, and Guerro Negro had hotels  booked weeks out. Had to call 7-10 places to get a single night stay, and they were dumpy sites"
2021-04-10 14:49:33,wallstreetbets,i just think Tourism is overpriced right now. When i see them trading above pre-pandemic with a butt load of additional challenges. Sure everyone wants to go on holiday but it’s a risky climate.
2021-04-10 16:20:19,wallstreetbets,Vaxed and waxed and ready to party!
2021-04-10 14:44:16,wallstreetbets,"Not OP and I don't disagree with your thoughts, however, this is about stock prices and making money. If Expedia is priced above pre-pandemic levels, then this incoming boom is already priced in and/or the stock is overvalued. So buying now doesn't make much sense."
2021-04-10 14:41:42,wallstreetbets,Honestly the recovery is already priced in at this point so what can knock it down or up is a change in those expectations of opening up in time for summer. If another surge happens and these variants aren't stopped by the vaccines we could see a big dip.
2021-04-10 14:51:09,wallstreetbets,"Lots of non-city airbnb and vrbo have been booked like crazy with people trying to get away from the city. We were supposed to go to the desert last year, airbnb that were 400-500/night are more like 800/night now.

People also have a shitload more money to spend on these trips now, what with not having to pay for commuting, not eating out, not going out to bars and restaurants for a year, not going to any shows or concerts for a year. We paid of tens of thousands of dollars in debt and refi'd the mortgage now it's $800/month less. Basically far better off financially than pre-covid not to mention the stock market boom from the government printing what will be...$10 trillion once the infrastructure bill passes?"

But after tourism was fucked, they shouldnt have been so high in the 1st place, so who the fuck knows, where all those stocks will go..."

2021-04-10 18:53:04,wallstreetbets,"but nearly everything is trading above pre-pandemic. Another poster mentioned market inflation due to additional QE and FED programs, which I think has a lot to do with it; even with that in mind I do agree that there is still potential for growth. Maybe not a ten-bagger but 20-30% gains (yeah I know this is WSB, but it's still potential triple returns from an index)."
2021-04-10 15:12:22,wallstreetbets,"How much of that price increase is overall market inflation and how much of that growth is beyond overall market growth though? Because if it didn't grow like the rest of the markets in the all-the-QE environment and it's still underpriced relative to the rest of the marketplace, it still could be a decent growth play. 

That being said, I have doubts if those fuckheads are long on it."

I promise you tech is high now but it’ll be way higher in 10 or 15 years there is no doubt in my mind about it"
2021-04-10 15:29:21,wallstreetbets,"That’s true but people are worried about another surge of covid cases, and there’s the UK variant etc etc. Of course it’s anyone’s guess, but I think there is another slice of excitement left when vaccines hit critical mass and places really start to open up again. When that excitement will hit, and more importantly perhaps when it will end, is a mystery. But I think we’re looking at more boom before bust."
2021-04-10 14:58:55,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that’s where my head is at."
2021-04-10 15:06:52,wallstreetbets,"What was it priced when it was “booming”?

2021-04-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks! This post is in continuation of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mjzvwy/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) post I made last week. The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes! 

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**                     

https://preview.redd.it/1dwe1p42xcs61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=a120cb970f727a95b925dca045324d6d551ba473

GameStop continues to be the top discussed stock though there has been a significant drop in the overall number of mentions (last week GME was mentioned 27K times). Tesla is now the number 2 most discussed stock. Facebook is the newcomer into the top 10 list but not in a good way. They had one of the largest data leaks (533 Million customers data was compromised) and the users were understandably pissed. The average sentiment across the comments reflects that. ASO also made it into the top 10 due to chatter on the stellar earnings report as well as the high short interest on the company.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/0l6jei65xcs61.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=3008545684de903944b2b4840d2c7e428e1442d9

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. 

**Romeo Power ($RMO)** was the company with the most growth in mentions. The stock was trending due to a 60% jump in stock price on Tuesday following a strategic deal they announced with truck giant PACCAR. 

**Nano-X Imaging($NNOX)** is a medical imaging technology company. They recently received 510(k) clearance from the FDA. NNOX’s CEO has said that the company is on track to commence system shipment’s from Q4'21. The company’s stock price shot up 20% only to lose over the next week.

**Academy Sports($ASO)** has been on the top growing stocks for two weeks now (which in turn made the stock figure in the top 10 most discussed stocks list). The company was mentioned heavily due to its stellar earnings report (EPS was an impressive 41% ahead of analyst estimates). Adding to this, the company is heavily shorted (\~40% short interest) and the stock price is expected to be highly volatile.

**Facebook($FB)** as discussed above was trending due to their data leak which exposed the user data of more than half-billion users. 

**Norwegian Cruise line($NCLH)** was generating discussions as its CEO has sent a proposal to the CDC on how the company could safely travel once again in July. The company is also planning to resume cruise operations for voyages boarding outside of the United States with sailings originating in Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and Greece starting in July 2021.

**SOME FAQ’s:** 

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments. 

Thank you for reading!

2021-04-10 10:51:58,wallstreetbets,"How did you build it. I'm intrigued about this program, is it like a python web crawler? I've been wanting to create a similar thing to track prices of certain goods across all online retail stores."

2021-04-10 13:54:45,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for your great work. One important question though.

While it's great to know what reddit is talking about, as a potential investor I would rather know how the stocks are doing. In other words, do the most mentioned stocks do well/better?

If so, do the stocks go up after people start talking about it (buy the rumor and make some easy money), or do people talk about them because theyare already going up (you will probably lose money by buying stocks that already peaked)? ."

2021-04-10 17:54:42,wallstreetbets,"I’m a newb. Can someone explain this to me?

He says he bought 15 contracts. Isn’t that a contract for 1500 shares? What did he pay for these contracts? Did he actually pay $24k just for contracts? Who on earth would pay that much just for a contract that he couldn’t even execute (that’s 300k to execute the contract if it is a $200 strike price, correct?)

Is he saying that somehow he found an even bigger sucker who pay 71k for this ridiculous contract? Who the fuck would pay 71k for the option of paying 300k for shares? The share price would have to hit $260 just to break even on that. What idiot is paying that premium?

Am I totally mistaken here?"

2021-04-10 15:01:19,wallstreetbets,Proof of selling it is in one of the comments
2021-04-10 08:59:39,wallstreetbets,"Of course I did. A little early as well, because it went over $200 a share by the end of day. Kicked myself in the ass over that."
2021-04-10 19:47:37,wallstreetbets,A lot of “fools” to be found when a stock shoots up 60% in a couple hours and everyone is waiting on a short squeeze. Harder to find anyone willing to sell those contracts in that moment.
2021-04-10 19:43:15,wallstreetbets,"I transferred out, this was the last of the cash I had left in there in case I wanted to do something while I was transferring. All of this was removed after this transaction as well. I have one lonely contract pending. Not sure about my hollow words, but I exited.

Edit: I was fucked harder than most, I was holding 2000 shares of GME when they froze it on us and forced margin to be repaid. It cost me hundreds of shares. I have been steady pulling out since then."
2021-04-10 14:00:25,wallstreetbets,Im already holding a good bit @ 37 average. This was the last of my funds left in RH. In case I decided to make a play like this while I transferred.
2021-04-10 14:02:55,wallstreetbets,"I did close it, that morning. I had transferred the rest if my assets/funds out of RH except that 24k, afterward I took those funds out as well. So in going back I didnt have a cute “Investing Pic” screen showing the gain from that day. I can show the sell though thats no problem."

2021-04-10 10:19:30,wallstreetbets,I couldnt even buy options. Tried buying a way otm option and it wouldnt even sell...
2021-04-10 11:23:55,wallstreetbets,Wow that’s amazing. Wish I had 15 contracts to buy haha. I have like 150 shares in one account and thinking of doing a CC for like two week strike at 250.  Prems ain’t bad for the biweekly

2021-04-10 13:52:21,wallstreetbets,"We know it goes against a narrative.

There’s a lot of people who don’t believe another squeeze is inbound who make a shit ton on plays like this and day trading GME. Dude YOLO’ing into options like this is the whole point of WSB, not herding everyone into the same place to manufacture a squeeze. Your comment is literal boiler room shit, as is every single comment telling people not to buy options."
2021-04-10 13:47:31,wallstreetbets,"Options do not hurt a squeeze, in fact they can greatly contribute to one."

However, I based it on there was a catalyst in May by the shareholder meeting or Microsoft event, he had a low strike, and it was July expiry. At any point, this would probably print if he bought on the way down or where it traded for a few days in the 13's. But, I guess I just had a different perspective of YOLO like those maniacs who wager thousands on KCH 60 strikes."
2021-04-10 18:48:29,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it’s not paper trading lol, and I picked July to give me time for demo and potential buyout before then"
2021-04-10 16:43:19,wallstreetbets,"Er it hit 24 like mid feb and there's been speculation of a buyout for ages with their Lidar vert. Lots of interesting action with new board members and hiring ramp up as well, so yeh don't need 'insider info' to make an educated yolo."
2021-04-10 11:46:37,wallstreetbets,Can’t paper trade on rh
2021-04-10 09:25:31,wallstreetbets,"I’d love to see some evidence of that, please look. I have and haven’t found anything"
2021-04-10 12:53:49,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, bar has been lowered significantly. Now that 70% of WSB is gen z boomers holding shares of single stocks indefinitely and dont even play weeklies.

That said, didnt MVIS go up like 50% in a day? If it takes a 20% tumble my man's gonna have a hell of a margin call and crazy paper losses. Might see him on the loss porn end come summer, hopefully not."
2021-04-10 09:27:36,wallstreetbets,Looking now. I’ll try the upcoming Digital Symposiums. Could have been my mistake from either a mix-up with another stock or that it was already demoed for Hololens 2.
2021-04-10 18:47:35,wallstreetbets,"No margin, cash only"
2021-04-10 09:28:44,wallstreetbets,Thank you! If you find out anything else interesting feel free to share it here or make another post and mention it here. Like I said demo or not I’m long on MVIS. Missed the last run up but it’s made me money before and now it’s on sale!
2021-04-10 10:24:59,wallstreetbets,"Maybe there's something that will be revealed at the shareholder's meeting about their automotive LIDAR sensors. This could have been another catalyst. Considering their patents, then it would seem more cost effective for a large automotive company or Microsoft to just outright purchase them. I'll keep digging though because I was looking at where they'll short this to a bottom. 13's seem to be support."
2021-04-10 10:43:01,wallstreetbets,"LOL. Now that I keep doing some searches on their MEMS for LIDAR, then I'm almost positive that even sub-20 prices are undervalued. Supposedly, they have the highest resolution at 1k and under in cost. Apple has rumored to be searching for buying out a LIDAR/sensor company. Man, what a speculative rabbit hole, that you can travel down with this one. I'd wager the shareholder's meeting will have some goodies to release. I don't have stock to vote right now. Anything in the proxy materials?"
2021-04-10 09:31:51,wallstreetbets,"YW. I’m very much wanting to buy back in from that last run. A lot of chattering about buy outs. Initially, I thought that they’d short it down for options in May, which I’d wager would occur if a buy back is in the works. I’d think they’d want that share price low on top of the actual stock trading price."
2021-04-10 10:06:08,wallstreetbets,"It's possible I assumed or read a rumor about the Microsoft Build Event in May. This is a collaboration whereby Microsoft releases developments for enterprises, business partners, and IT for products that they can engage in. Perhaps, there'll be something for the Hololens 2.

2021-04-10 10:48:34,wallstreetbets,"I don’t have any shares right now. I was cash gang until I was cleared to trade options, now I’m sitting on cash waiting to jump in on MVIS options. 

Thank you for all the info it has been helpful and encouraging! If you find more let me know please, and I will do the same!"
2021-04-10 12:50:59,wallstreetbets,Yep. Same here. I cashed out at 17 on that crazy run up and knew it'd drop back down. I just wasn't sure where that support floor was at with the May options looking like they could wash it down closer to 10. Which I'd love to put about 8K on a buy there.
2021-04-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$TSM The Shorty Long Bull You can can play this bitch short, you can run it long. Fact is their product is sold, absolutely sold until 2024. They are booked for 3 years and cannot make enough. hell if i could buy Samsung I would because they are exactly in the same position. Buy the dips, sell the Peaks, for 3 more years or just hold, you're going to fucking win. The only thing fucking this up is if Taiwan actually shoots down a Chinese plane and this old man has to intervein.  High Risk.

Now TSM along with Samsung have been setting up supply chains in Texas and Arizona. $TSM also is investing in japan. Intel is following with their Biden bucks to piggy back off the supply chains created by $TSM and Samsung. This will hurt intel and help $TSM and Samsung.

Conclusion:  
This investment will absolutely collapse with warfare between Taiwan and china. Especially with Taiwan's water drought. But if the US continues to BIG DICK for Taiwan we will see incredible growth.

2021-04-10 02:14:37,wallstreetbets,"I got like 2K shares in TSM and a shit ton of leaps. That thing was great in 2020 but shit has been in a downward spiral since mid Feb. Here's to hoping it'll break out to the upside. TSM literally has the Taiwanese govt backing. It got US subsidies to build an AZ plant. It's at the top of its industry. A supplier to everybody. Chips ain't going anywhere soon with more things being connected to the internet. 

The only risk is Gayna. Fuck them. If you are going to play TSM, do not do weeklies or monthlies for that matter. It moves very slow. Go for leaps or buy shares and sell OTM weeklies."

Kinda a big glaring oversight in your post, this drought is absolutely fucking TSM raw and so far it doesn't look like it's going to be able to recover until it's fully over.  Water will be rationed and TSM will not get it."
2021-04-10 08:13:33,wallstreetbets,"I agree! People talk about other chip companies as if they also produce half of the worlds chips.

And China won’t invade without total war, because America won’t lose its oil, I mean chips. Same thing.

TSM is my favorite blue chip to hold along with Boeing!"
2021-04-10 04:09:31,wallstreetbets,Thinking that the US and China would go to war over Taiwan is complete FUD produced by the US military industrial complex
2021-04-10 01:48:26,wallstreetbets,"Big fan. Just hoping the drought ends soon. I have concerns with intel, but so far they have shown that they can’t hang, so tsm has a big advantage. I expected competition to rise, but probably not faster than demand. So I’m very bullish over the next year."

2021-04-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"MVIS Technical Analysis- Microvision has broken out and is on the verge of another spike  So, you FOMO'd into $MVIS, only to watch it go down all week.

Or maybe you were smart enough to realize you missed the bus, but still felt that twinge of *""what if??""*

Well, fear not, fellow retards, because I have broken out the crayons, read the tea leaves, and *allegedly* slaughtered a goat, spun it around in circles, and interpreted the blood splatter to predict the future, and I'm here to tell you that $MVIS is going to surge again, as early as next week!

u/WrathofKhaan did a great breakdown detailing the huge bull case [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/minugt/microvision_investment_thesis_and_summary_of_dd/), so I'm not going to get into that, but I will provide some TA to show you why it may be starting as soon as Monday.

Please note: I am retarded, this is my first time posting something like this, I am still learning, and I welcome any feedback or tips. Also, this is not financial advice, etc., etc.

To start, lets look at the 10-day chart to establish previous resistance, current support, and the stock's current pattern. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/trq7o5mi3as61.png?width=2676&format=png&auto=webp&s=75fbfd88582588b3bf5277c5fe719144c1e57986

If you pay attention to the pretty purple crayons (my most favorite flavor,) you will see that there was a clear resistance line at $13.75 from 3/25 to 3/31.  You will also see that after the spike on 3/31, the same $13.75 line has turned into a support line, establishing the base of the descending triangle the stock has been in for the past week.

Following the peaks since the 3/31 spike gives us the other leg we need to fully establish this pattern.

*“But wait!”* you might be saying. *“Descending bad! Stonks go up!”* 

Easy now, Chongo. Lets just zoom in a little to the 5-day chart so we can see what has been going on this week a little more clearly. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9smi88i54as61.png?width=2671&format=png&auto=webp&s=01f12003d28fcd831826b05c5b5d8ca03a7e5c4c

If you follow the pretty purple again, the first thing you will notice is that there was a **Bullish Breakout** in the last 30 minutes of trading this week. The decreasing volume throughout the pattern, combined with the spike at the breakout helps to confirm this. 

The next bits of confirmation we should look at are the MACD and RSI. If you don't know what these are, the important thing to note about MACD is that the crossover between the red and green lines generally means a change in price trend. Essentially, if red is above green, price is going up- if green is above red, price is going down- and lastly, the points where the two lines meet signify a current or impending trend change.

The important thing to know about RSI is that it is a number that oscillates between 0-100- when it hits 30, a stock is generally considered “oversold” and is due for a correction (stonk goes up,) and when it hits 70, the stock is generally considered “overbought” and is (you guessed it) due for a correction (stonk goes down.) 

However, these indicators can be kind of spotty at the scale we're at (15 minutes), so lets zoom back out to the 10-day chart, and switch over to the hourly scale. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kar7pail4as61.png?width=2683&format=png&auto=webp&s=71c3dd1f4c417f5e034b76bb4a87ea7c4bfdf780

Follow the tasty arrows, and you can now clearly see the history of MACD crossovers and price trend changes, along with where the MACD is now. 

This also gives us a better picture of RSI, showing that it is in an uptrend, but with plenty of room to go before approaching oversold territory. 

These indicators, along with the volume spike at market close, confirm the bullish breakout of the descending triangle pattern, and all of them combined point towards serious upward price movement in the immediate future.   

I'll see you retards on the moon. 

Tl;dr – tasty crayons say MVIS calls go brrrrrrrrrrr 

Positions: $MVIS 4/16 14c"
2021-04-10 08:38:57,wallstreetbets,"There is a lot of great DD on MVIS, especially in r/MVIS . This is just a buy and hold for me at < $15 with the expectation of near-term results (like 3-6 months possibly?)

Not really a sexy WSB play but if I were feeling really fucking retarded, I would place my bets on 5/21 calls with anticipation of massive news dropping post A-sample completion and private demos. Seems like they're already teetering on a buyout from potentially Google or Microsoft, or both for different departments possibly (AR and Lidar), or someone else all together possibly? But the connections currently seem to point towards MS and the Googe."
2021-04-10 05:51:36,wallstreetbets,I’ve been all in on MVIS for a bit now.
2021-04-10 01:39:58,wallstreetbets,I don’t know where I keep finding the money but Im all in this one too I guess. I don’t even read this stuff but figure you guys know what you’re talking about with those fancy graphs.
2021-04-10 07:34:46,wallstreetbets,It's being offered up at a discount right now. 🚀🌕
2021-04-10 07:51:29,wallstreetbets,"I fomo'd in at $5 in January,  waiting for $50 before I cash out."
2021-04-10 05:10:51,wallstreetbets,Very bullish here. Good buy in price right now with potential news anyway and the product getting released to companies.
2021-04-10 02:02:15,wallstreetbets,"Their demo is supposed to be this April, and I’m guessing it will be late April, but for the sake of those 4/16 calls let’s hope it’s earlier. I’ve been wanting to start a position to play their LIDAR demo but have been waiting for the price to drop more."
2021-04-10 02:23:46,wallstreetbets,i’m so into this confirmation bias
2021-04-10 05:07:08,wallstreetbets,I’m in on Monday

2021-04-10 08:20:43,wallstreetbets,"The thing with TA is that you ask five different people you'll get five different answers.

Imagine you did this mid day on April 8th. You draw a downward trend (that's a bit steeper because you're trying to fit to existing data) and you'll notice the midday hump is the breakout. You begin to see crossover in MACD and upwards trend in RSI. You'll reach the same conclusion - but we know how that day ended."
2021-04-10 03:06:17,wallstreetbets,Nice I had the same conclusion and made my family buy some more stock. I’m myself broke with all my money in GME
2021-04-10 09:58:11,wallstreetbets,I support this
2021-04-10 01:46:07,wallstreetbets,"As a company and value investment it seems pretty decent. But from a TA perspective, the stock will drop more in the near future. 

&#x200B;

1h chart and the 20-50-100 EMA reversed in a bear trend. Every time that happened, the stock dipped. Could be wrong, but I am really considering getting a position around the 12-13 price point."
2021-04-10 02:11:25,wallstreetbets,"So, entire market rallied hard over the last hour today. I don’t mean to burst your bubble, and I’m also net long delta MVIS, but this may or may not mean anything. You need more data to confirm a breakout, this might very well fizzle out and continue to trade sideways or bleed for some time. I hope you’re right, though, and I do agree that MVIS is now at support, and if it holds, it might bounce, but if it breaks, we’re screwed."

2021-04-10 12:24:32,wallstreetbets,I think his assumption has a better case than it going down.  It doesn't assure it but anything can happen.  The stock is pretty much at support atm.  Of it drops past support we will see 12 again.  Fire sale!

2021-04-10 12:21:38,wallstreetbets,This company isn't going out of business anytime soon so it's only bad for a short position perspective.  This stock has better long term benefits.  So bad to you could mean fire sale to others...  all depends if you believe in the company and its tech.

2021-04-10 04:57:20,wallstreetbets,use limit buy/sell orders to avoid slippage.
2021-04-10 07:44:56,wallstreetbets,never ever do market orders for anything

2021-04-10 01:48:12,wallstreetbets,The OG AMD trader is back ... now with PLTR?
2021-04-10 01:09:35,wallstreetbets,You will be rich. Pltr will hit above $100 within 5 years.
2021-04-10 01:00:17,wallstreetbets,"Demo day will be mind blowing. Some analysts think pltr’s commercial growth is not fast enough to justify the current price level of 23, but what the analyst fails to predict is the exponential adoption rate of pltr’s Foundry software by every industry. Karp himself said that in the not so distant future, corporations will have to use pltr’s software in order to stay relevant and survive. There have been so many cases of pltr’s software saving companies hundreds of millions of dollars. The software is fully vertically integrated and unlocks so much potential value of a company. In this sense, Pltr is basically a ticking time bomb to explode to 40+ a share once investors realize this is almost a mandatory software for any major corporations. Pltr’s software is too complex for any competitor to imitate or compete against."
2021-04-10 01:09:50,wallstreetbets,"Fuck, I thought I was... but you sir have your helmet on and everything here.
Good luck 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"

2021-04-10 04:18:15,wallstreetbets,I’ve actually been waiting month for it too go green finally 🙏
2021-04-10 01:27:05,wallstreetbets,"Pltr has already become too important of a company for US and western world to fail. Karp takes immense pride that Pltr aid US to  have the best military and industrial software in the AI arms race. Now finally on demo day, Pltr is proving their deep value in commercial application of Foundry software from consumer retail to pharmaceuticals. Last demo mainly focused on Gotham and the fundamental structure of Foundary. For this upcoming demo, Karp will present how Pltr’s software compliments every single industry and companies in Fortune 500. It is not an exaggeration that all 500 of the Fortune 500 companies will be using Pltr software one way or another in the next decades. Karp sees this happening himself and the guy is not joking. Karp is very cautious about not drawing too much attention to the stock but it is no secret that Pltr’s true value is far greater than 23 a share. Kathie woods bought during all the dips at 12, 18, 25, 23, etc. So you get the point how Pltr is one of her deep value picks."
2021-04-10 05:45:10,wallstreetbets,Cathie motherfucking Wood sure is. She’s adding PLTR like a crackhead.
2021-04-10 16:27:02,wallstreetbets,"I've got 19 shares. So, I'm something of a big deal myself."

2021-04-10 03:05:04,wallstreetbets,"Hell yea! I thought I was balling with 5,120 shares.  Now I feel like a wuss."
2021-04-10 08:31:34,wallstreetbets,Ready to see this shit plunge like always after good news.

2021-04-10 05:00:51,wallstreetbets,Palantir brings in some of their clients to share the work they've been doing with Palantir's Foundry. Should give more insights into the product and client feedback. Should be a good day overall.
2021-04-10 00:12:10,wallstreetbets,Idk their product or some shit. They do a run through of projections their software makes and how a company would use that shit. Point is there was a run up before the last demo. A leak would absolutely make this go bonkers I think
2021-04-10 06:51:40,wallstreetbets,They show off their tech to their partners and select investors/clients.
2021-04-10 09:11:29,wallstreetbets,"Given that his average price is around $27, he sits at a 11% loss."

2021-04-10 05:02:26,wallstreetbets,The analysts are not wrong.... I do think commercial has a lot of room to grow. Palantir has been making sigificant progress in their government business. My PT for the stock is $45 EOY.
2021-04-10 00:17:30,wallstreetbets,I don’t understand the multiple strikes... is there a reason people do this?
2021-04-09 23:38:11,wallstreetbets,Some people might say these current prices are a buying opportunity

2021-04-10 00:18:56,wallstreetbets,Yeah so I bag more profits if this absolutely skyrockets. The more otm the strike the riskier but also the more profitable if it goes itm.

2021-04-10 16:11:59,wallstreetbets,"Lol. I agree. We are all holding long term, I'm okay if it tanks as a result of the demo day, we all understand it, but the larger public discounts these events. I'm counting on it and okay with it is my point. 1k shares in at $9.30 already looking to accumulate more."

I’m in my 20s have plenty of time to build this back up if GME doesnt moon, but it will.

2021-04-10 16:51:15,wallstreetbets,Man this is so stupid its not even funny
2021-04-10 18:04:30,wallstreetbets,Dude purchasing now and hoping it's at bottom is like trying to catch a falling knife. The smart play is to wait for confirmation at a 10% rise before adding to your position like that.
2021-04-10 18:16:53,wallstreetbets,Your 401K let’s you buy whatever you want? Damn
2021-04-10 03:52:22,wallstreetbets,you're really applauding this man throwing his life away wow

2021-04-10 08:46:09,wallstreetbets,"This is why self directed 401ks should be banned

I'll be paying for your retirement.  8 to 10 years of untaxed income yoloed into a meme stock puts a lot of risk on the rest of us- no way to recover from this if it goes tits up"

2021-04-10 04:35:53,wallstreetbets,You own more physical shares than some hedges out there. You'll be fine when they need to cover.

2021-04-10 01:49:59,wallstreetbets,if you’re holding I’m holding
2021-04-10 02:32:53,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a nice disaster!
2021-04-10 08:08:15,wallstreetbets,Can I give you my Venmo acct?   You’d be better off just sending me your money than trading.   Just back of the envelope math but guessing your first buy was in the mid $400’s?   Ugh.
2021-04-10 01:01:41,wallstreetbets,I'm assuming this is Fidelity? I don't know if my 401(k) allows me to do individual stocks. Halp???
2021-04-10 01:43:11,wallstreetbets,This guy fuks
2021-04-10 05:50:59,wallstreetbets,Slightly better return than Melvin 😂

2021-04-10 10:14:34,wallstreetbets,"I feel bad for you. It cant be easy to eat a loss this big, but it's going to get bigger from here."
2021-04-10 12:06:00,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-10 13:39:13,wallstreetbets,"Lot of people trying to push you to sell covered calls. Wtf is the point of that? Iv is low, price is way below your avg, just hold on for dear life and let’s watch it boost straight to Mars 🚀🚀🚀"

2021-04-10 13:49:14,wallstreetbets,"Any of you that are saying ""this man is mad"" are in the wrong sub, this sub is for degenerates of the first order who want to get rich quick, or die trying. Head on back to /investing to spew your 3% yearly gains."
2021-04-10 00:56:16,wallstreetbets,The stock is what i like the most
2021-04-10 03:11:57,wallstreetbets,"You bet we are!
And the dip today was a nice gift! Could only afford a 33% increase though 🙈"
2021-04-10 08:47:05,wallstreetbets,You're fu ked
2021-04-10 08:53:13,wallstreetbets,Dumb
2021-04-09 23:57:01,wallstreetbets,When does the margin call on Citadel happen causing them to have to buy back all the shares to rid of the counterfeits?
2021-04-10 01:31:33,wallstreetbets,"You should have bought it at $10. Too late now. They aren't even profitable. On the way out of business unless they raise cash by putting out more shares which lowers your ownership %. Hahaha

I bet after you lose your 401k and your job you'll be demanding $$ from the gov because you don't have anything. Might as well have a meth addiction."
2021-04-10 13:37:23,wallstreetbets,"It honestly seems like all the haters are just people that are afraid to take risks. Sure, this stock is a risk, but that goes for every single stock that exists or has ever existed. The way GameStop is changing their business and improving their leadership and management, this company will be solid even without a squeeze or all of this hype."
2021-04-10 01:58:08,wallstreetbets,You are welcome for the $200 award. I'm coming for you and $272 is an impressive 401k yolo. Congrats!
2021-04-10 09:02:34,wallstreetbets,You’re screwed bro
2021-04-10 04:08:50,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-04-10 07:07:40,wallstreetbets,Oh we’re coming. Just hold tight.
2021-04-10 08:25:02,wallstreetbets,"Holy hell, nice diamond balls. 
I did a few gme trades, managed to recup my losses then went all in at 271 and now my bags are heavy as shit. But I only have 2k in it so it's nothing. 

I just avoid looking at it now otherwise I'll be tempted to sell to put in something else.
You just gave me some more strength lol"
2021-04-10 09:08:06,wallstreetbets,Honestly you made a good investment. MOAS aside gamestop will be a company on the s&p 500 so just hold on and start the deep frier. Cause the tendies are coming.
2021-04-10 03:28:38,wallstreetbets,We coming for you. Hold strong.
2021-04-10 02:57:54,wallstreetbets,I just keep buying the dips now. Pick you up on the way to the moon.
2021-04-10 05:17:07,wallstreetbets,Big yikes my dude. Love it
2021-04-10 05:27:28,wallstreetbets,We are definitely coming for you. This is just day with volume away. We don't even have to ignite to reach that.
2021-04-10 05:37:06,wallstreetbets,"We are in our way, inevitably"
2021-04-10 15:16:38,wallstreetbets,DUDE - you just added like 10 years of office slave labor to your working career by blowing your 401k. Mid life crisis incoming.
2021-04-10 06:08:11,wallstreetbets,"I'm holding at $282 average currently, though I have nowhere near your number of shares.  I believe that we'll get out of this just fine.  It is not easy, but especially for people in our position, we have no choice but to hold and wait.  No matter what happens with the squeeze, I think that we are now invested in a good company and we will eventually recover our investments and make a profit.  I am hoping that we will have a squeeze in the very near future so that we can get our reward quickly, but I don't think anyone can really say when it will happen. It is obvious that the current drops in price are a result of manipulation by the hedge funds, and are a futile attempt to scare us.  They are the ones who are truly scared, and so they should!"
2021-04-10 01:20:57,wallstreetbets,That's a definite hopefully.
2021-04-10 01:25:54,wallstreetbets,We $cum for u

2021-04-10 01:57:23,wallstreetbets,Nice work 👏
2021-04-10 07:29:21,wallstreetbets,My 401k doesnt even allow us to buy individual stock...is this a true 401k plan or just what you're calling your retirement savings?
2021-04-10 07:50:49,wallstreetbets,I did the same thing my fellow ape. No regrets! Let's gooooooooo
2021-04-10 08:30:19,wallstreetbets,Cmon if you’re gonna fake a yolo at least don’t leave the grey edit box
2021-04-10 09:30:24,wallstreetbets,This is the third yolo post in 24 hours that all had the same price per share amount...interesting.
2021-04-10 10:19:26,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry, Medicaid isn't too bad."
2021-04-10 11:43:14,wallstreetbets,I would update the title flair to *loss* rather than yolo cause that’s all this is gonna be. Loss porn is funny. Loss porn from a 401k account of a literal meme is big sad.
2021-04-10 11:55:24,wallstreetbets,"Dude not in 401k... this is your retirement... gamble in your regular brokerage account, or 5% of your 401k or Roth in speculation idk..."

2021-04-10 12:35:44,wallstreetbets,Fucking retarded right here. Have fun losing your 401k
2021-04-10 12:36:53,wallstreetbets,Imagine losing 90% of your 401k in Gamestop.

2021-04-10 17:45:26,wallstreetbets,"We are retarded, but with all we know, it’s extremely retarded to not get involved in this, I could make a movie with all the finds and deep analysis we have put together showing this stock guaranteeing to squeeze, I never have seen anything like this in my 6 years of investing. My only concerns are the aftermath of the squeeze what repercussion will this cause on the market, the value of the dollar if they need to print money just to cover every share. It’s safer to be invested in GME/AMC than not."
2021-04-10 19:33:00,wallstreetbets,I would also like to point out that I am outperforming Melvin Capital by 8%
2021-04-10 08:54:03,wallstreetbets,Holy shit you’re losing a lot.
2021-04-10 11:21:03,wallstreetbets,"Sorry bud, you’re on your own on this one."
2021-04-10 12:39:53,wallstreetbets,"No. The truth is, no one is coming to get you. And you just blew a good chunk of your retirement on a meme.

But hopefully you’re young and have enough money where this doesn’t matter. But if it does matter, in all seriousness, if it matters even a little bit, cut your losses and move on."

Ps what’s the lounge that’s being spoken of?"
2021-04-10 01:31:24,wallstreetbets,What kind of 401k do you have that lets you buy stocks? Or did you shift it over to a brokeragelink account?

2021-04-10 10:10:42,wallstreetbets,I love it. Although I’m not retarded/smart enough to put my whole 401k on GME I did put 1/3 of it into the stonk
2021-04-10 11:29:42,wallstreetbets,Doubled down and still at $272? A true retarded ape.
2021-04-10 12:11:19,wallstreetbets,"Forgive my retardation, but how did you rebalance your 401k into an individual stonk?"
2021-04-10 12:32:19,wallstreetbets,I’m with you.

2021-04-10 09:36:42,wallstreetbets,Why does anyone care about 150k worth of equity. Best case scenario you double it or lose just about everything. Might as well hit the Blackjack table
2021-04-10 12:17:00,wallstreetbets,How can I reinvest my 401k? Are there some companies that let you choose stock? My assumption was it was all stock in my company
2021-04-10 12:50:02,wallstreetbets,"Wait... this is in your 401k?

So if you decide to cash out after... you lose half...

Ok... I mean, its not SOO bad when you consider other states will take away about half as well.

But does that mean you have to lose half and THEN pay extra tax because its considered income?

You may have doubly fucked yourself if this is the case, and you'll only get to keep about a quarter of it...

Please tell me that the GME is not inside your 401k..."
2021-04-10 13:23:23,wallstreetbets,I feel bad even with just my 5 shares because other people are out here with their dick's on the line. Not even the same thing.

and my fucking payday is on Monday!"
2021-04-10 01:51:34,wallstreetbets,"I averaged up :( lol, panick bought at 168"
2021-04-10 03:58:29,wallstreetbets,"I did not double down for some weeks now. I know, this is not the way. But after doubling down so many times to 272 shares, my personal risk tolerance of 50 percent net worth on GME is reached. I am not rich so this is at my age of 27 pretty much for me. So let's go to the moon so I never will have to work kek. No for real, after getting your tendies, don't just stop working (especially if you are young). 'never settle' is the motto of the phone brand 'one plus' (which I have a smartphone from) and I think it's a good slogan for your life. If you are older and have worked plenty, it's ok to retire I think 😊
Stay strong, you beautiful apes.

After all if this I want to thank my dead grampa for the money I got after he died from my dad's cut of the inheritence. Otherwise I would never have been able to invest in GME (and other stuff).
I wanna thank my mom for always paying my rent so I would not have to work besides studying. I know i am privileged and I may be a lazy scumbag for not starting full time work till last week at the age of 27 after quitting uni."

2021-04-09 23:45:38,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't want to hamstring my profits.
2021-04-09 23:45:25,wallstreetbets,"Not at these IV levels with upcoming potential catalysts. If I end up holding long term, I probably will. CCs are the only options strategy I can do in my 401k, otherwise I’d sell call credit spreads to get some premium back but also keep some upside for the squeeze."
2021-04-10 09:21:27,wallstreetbets,"No, my only option isn’t holding. I can also buy more."
2021-04-10 05:15:35,wallstreetbets,"Disagree. It’s his 401k, not his gambling fund."

Was pissed at myself for a month for getting lost in the hype. Fortunately it came back up, and I was able to take some nice profits this second run up, wasn't going to be stuck holding bags again. Not sure how many more chances these apes will get."
2021-04-10 09:57:21,wallstreetbets,Lol the stock market is risky bro. Your 401 will get blown up and recover before you retire. And it won't be because of this guy.

2021-04-10 08:32:18,wallstreetbets,"> I like the stock long term



Then why are you buying at these prices? The highest GME ever got was low 50s in 2007 when business was booming. With inflation lets say that's 65. The company is currently in the worst financial position it's ever been and you're telling me it's worth more than in 2007? If you're in it for the long term you may not see any gains for a while since it's already 1000% up from what it was 6 months ago.

GME was supposed to be a squeeze play, not a long term play. It can still be a long term play if you got in early like DFV years ago. I swear all you guys changed your mind after losing your entire accounts. Now it's a long term play? lmao. Let's be real, you never invested for the long term but now it's your play because it's the only thing you can do."

I don't care what the billionaire owned media says and I don't care that short sellers and hedge funds are crying that what this community is doing is unfair to them.  They have had all of the advantages and they have stolen from retail for decades. It is time that we take back what is ours, and we will absolutely accomplish that objective, no matter how long it takes.  Apes strong forever!"

The risk/reward is not there. That’s just my opinion. But I guess it’s personal finance for a reason. As long as OP understands the implications."
2021-04-10 14:14:50,wallstreetbets,My point is this isn’t really an exciting thing to be regularly updating the community on given the size of the position and the potential upside/downside.

I made 30k on GME Puts in like 2 months with way OTM puts because I don't want to get assigned. Had i sold near the money I could have made 60k or more.

With 500 shares you could have made 6-10k a week in the last 2 months alone...50k at least. Basically at least cutting your cost basis in half."

2021-04-10 05:08:10,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m not sure how many of these GME holders are memeing or plain retarded. Glad to see someone else suggesting that their numbers are never going to happen to hopefully save some of these guys some money.
2021-04-10 08:02:58,wallstreetbets,"It is technically possible, but realistically unlikely(understatement.)

I don't think the government would touch it. It would taint America's free market cover. I mean, they might, but it seems to me like that wouldn't be a great idea. A more likely situation would be NYSE halting it to under the guise of investigation or market makers and hedge funds using tricks left and right to soften the blow or deflate the possible price. Media being one of those tricks. 

If we're being really really hopeful. I can see 100k in a black swan type of rare moment where everything goes right and a bunch of whales and long position holding institution allow and encourage it to go higher.

More realistically. If a squeeze happens. I'm picturing anywhere between 1k - 10k depending on actual short interest and levels of naked shorts. I can't see institutions, nor retail holding pass these levels if it occurred. I'd love to be proven wrong though. Wouldn't we all?"
2021-04-10 09:29:26,wallstreetbets,"$40 would be 10x the price the stock was going for before the meme. Man, this stuff hurts to watch, it’s straight up like political news, you hear that GME will go to the moon enough times you begin to believe it.

2021-04-10 06:59:36,wallstreetbets,CCs so you can lose unrealized gains in addition to your actual normal losses.  It's like a new frontier on losing money.  I love the feeling of whoring out my shares.

I see a lot of stupid shit here, but this is among the most stupid financial decisions you can make."
2021-04-10 05:24:03,wallstreetbets,The idea is to create bag holders rather than a sudden sell crash. There are many smart people pushing $1M per share - this is definitely malicious

2021-04-10 05:22:03,wallstreetbets,What are you talking about? It will obviously reach 1m/s duh.. Anyone selling for less is retarded
2021-04-10 11:40:22,wallstreetbets,"Maybe not $1M but $500,000 is NOT a meme."
2021-04-10 13:04:10,wallstreetbets,"It is not technically possible.   Hitting a price of 1M per share would price the company in excess of 70 trillion dollars.     I'm not sure you realize how big a number that is.    You should compare it to the US GDP or the total capitalization of all S&P companies combined - much bigger than either of those.

If you go by the conservative FINRA short interest number of 10M shares (which many believe wildly understate the short position) that would equal 10 Trillion in money owed by short parties.   No one has that kind of money to pay up.

All institutional shorts would be bankrupt long before the stock hit 1M and they would definitely halt trading on the stock if not the whole stock market.    

If they didn't intervene, it would cause insolvency of some major firms and that would cause cascading failures.    The entire stock market would plunge as multiple firms attempted to liquidate everything to raise cash which of course only makes the situation worse and then causes other firms to do the same.   It would make 2008 look like a picnic.    So no, its not possible.

Anyway that's technical.   Emotionally it is also impossible.   I don't care how many diamond emojis people here put on their posts, if the stock suddenly went up to even $10k, never mind $100k there would be tons of people that would sell their shares as soon as they could.    The idea that everyone is going to just sit on their hands until it hits some magic number is pure fantasy."

2021-04-10 11:55:12,wallstreetbets,"No,  but it won’t hamstring gains if you do it with 100 underlying shares"
2021-04-10 06:09:04,wallstreetbets,"So how is it worth it for whomever bought the contracts?

If he gets payed 190 and also the premium for the contract then it's a win win no matter what? That Durant Mahe sense to me.. I thought he would owe the buyer of the contracts 100 shares per contract and have to sell them at the current price no? (158) even though they ills be worth 190"
2021-04-10 19:58:16,wallstreetbets,"So I will ask you one question that my ape brain can semi-comprehend, how do you reconcile the amount of ownership of shares? If it hasn't been shorted to ""beyond"" how do you approach those levels of % of ownership? In all seriousness."
2021-04-10 13:10:43,wallstreetbets,"You're right. I'm using the wrong word(English isn't my first language.) It's theoretically possible is what I meant. And I stand by that. Yes, I do know how big that number is. It is technically not possible based on the information we have at hand, even with rampant assumptions and speculations. This I agree on.



I want to ask. Are you saying ""The idea that everyone is going..."" To me? Because I'm of the idea that most people would paper hand pretty quick. I really think most people would start selling as soon as it hit Jan peak and if there's enough short interest as ammunition, it could go between the 1k-10k area, but people would be selling from the very start of a squeeze(if it happened.) So we're not in opposition."

2021-04-10 09:28:04,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I think at least 6,7,8 or more years.for most people.  I have a 401k, I manage it but I quit contributing to it, its in snowball effect at this point.  I invest in mutuals and etfs, im retiring early without penalties and thus no longer need a 401k, but its just there as another stream that ill pull when im older."

2021-04-10 17:52:51,wallstreetbets,"I was a part of the original squeeze. Had 50 shares at one point and made a bit of money off of it. 

But I was close to losing everything by about 12 hours. 

It came back, sure, but that isn't always going to happen. I think this is it and I don't want to see people's retirement getting blown up.

It's fine to gamble a couple thousand but single digit shares are, imo, the safest bet. If it goes sky high you'll still make some. But you won't lose everything."
2021-04-10 09:42:47,wallstreetbets,The “gorillionaire” comment was highly underrated.
2021-04-10 11:17:49,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I do."
2021-04-10 09:37:39,wallstreetbets,"Ah, OK. So one option you have is to ""roll"" them -buy them back and sell new ones at a different strike/expiry. You might have to go a few weeks/months out, but you should be able to sell a new call further out and at a higher strike and net a premium from it. Then not only do you get the premium, but you'll still get the Theta decay (which, in this case it'll be decaying into equity instead of cash).

Getting assigned on CCs isn't a bad thing, it means you realized max profits for a trade!"

2021-04-10 06:37:06,wallstreetbets,Yeah they require no proof. You can literally say you stopped working overtime but still got 40 a week and that’s technically still “financial impact”. Speaking from experience lol
2021-04-10 09:43:37,wallstreetbets,"Buying calls is how I zeroed out one of my play accounts. That was a few grand learning experience. Now I’ve started dabbling selling covered calls seems a bit more stable and less risky. Sure you cap your upside, but weekly OTMs or future far OTM on some of these meme stocks are still pretty crazy all things considered."
2021-04-10 18:24:36,wallstreetbets,"I absolutely agree with you and understand your point.  The key is to never invest more than you feel comfortable losing.  I came in at the end of the original squeeze and was up, but held on and lost hugely in the after hours trading on Friday.  I had an average of $235 and came back on Monday morning to see it was $95.  It was my first time ever buying and selling a stock and I had no idea what I was doing.  Unfortunately, I sold everything, then repeated this stupidity a couple of more times.  I finally decided to have diamond hands all the way in February when I joined WSB and saw what everyone here was doing.  I didn't sell the last time when it reached $348 even though I could have erased all my losses and taken and doubled my investment.  Yeah...pretty stupid, I know.  I've been debating about buying more shares in order to average down, and now with the price at about $160, it seems like a reasonable time to try it.  Of course, the more you invest, consequently you are exposed to more risk and that is dangerous.  This has honestly been weighing on me heavily since I have been looking to triple my investment.  Even doing that doesn't bring my average down to close to where I want it.  If the stock dips lower and doesn't recover, then I am majorly screwed if I up my position. If the stock goes up, great.  If I don't do anything and the stock goes sky high, then I still do well.  I'm not greedy and I'm not looking to retire from this, but I hope for the best.  I do feel terrible for those who have invested their retirement accounts and are suffering losses currently.  I want to help my fellow apes and be supportive.  I wish for the best for everyone.  I hope we can continue to discuss this.  When you say that you think that this is it, do you mean that you think that the squeeze is over or that this is the last dip?  I have to give my 3 year old son some attention, so I better go.  Thank you very much for your advise and time."

2021-04-10 11:29:38,wallstreetbets,The risk that the stock price rises and you lose out on the upside. For example with GME if it ever really took off you'd lose the upside.
2021-04-10 01:59:48,wallstreetbets,"Ah, well, it happens. I got downvoted to negative ninety something on comments today for implying that we’re lacking sufficient data to say definitively that the shorts haven’t covered GME. And then I tried to calm down the situation and be playful, and was told that I’m an angsty and cringe sixteen year old who’s never gotten his way.

It definitely happens, especially if you’re not afraid to have opinions against popular sentiment.

2021-04-10 10:22:38,wallstreetbets,Ha absolutely. I tested it out in my Robinhood account which always had my “monopoly” money if you will. First few hit and I suddenly thought I knew what I was doing. Then next couple went sideways and that’s when I realized why OTM calls were generally “cheap”. That same observation though is why selling covered calls on meme stocks looks so juicy right now. The volatility of them is crazy and far OTMs are not cheap all things considered.

I would suggest expecting to take a hit if you own shares and pay close attention to how it plays out so you will have an easier time navigating these situations in future."

2021-04-10 00:36:02,wallstreetbets,A company... like VXX... 🤦‍♂️
2021-04-10 02:36:54,wallstreetbets,"Guys, he has to be kidding? ...Right?"
2021-04-10 01:00:26,wallstreetbets,"The VIX ETNs are often tied to IV, and they usually decay over time. Inverse VIX ETNs are the opposite, but they can be wiped out by huge spikes in volatility."
2021-04-10 00:21:44,wallstreetbets,They’re a really shitty company
2021-04-10 07:34:03,wallstreetbets,You’re an idiot
2021-04-10 09:09:04,wallstreetbets,...it's not a company...
2021-04-10 01:21:35,wallstreetbets,"Because if they don’t do this every year or so the price goes to fractions of a penny, as it’s designed to"
2021-04-09 22:38:57,wallstreetbets,"""VXX price is too low imo"""
2021-04-09 22:40:24,wallstreetbets,"Well just looking at their chart I’d say they’re scared of dropping below market allowances and wind up becoming a pink sheet. So a 4:1 will put them at what, 40? Then they can drop some more without losing their status."

2021-04-10 01:21:29,wallstreetbets,"what i mean is that the reverse splits are expected to happen regularly, so it's not marketing moving news. But anyways i think it was good posting about it, a lot of people here don't seem to know what VXX is"
2021-04-10 16:05:29,wallstreetbets,"they are designed with a certain maturity date. The original VXX actually already expired in 2019, it was simultaneously traded with the replacement ticker VXXB, which changed its name to VXX after the original one expired"
2021-04-09 23:15:10,wallstreetbets,"Right, but that shouldn't have any impact on the momentum for SPY, right?"
2021-04-09 22:36:09,wallstreetbets,"You mean, like, you shouldn't hold any ETNs with roll issues for more than a day or two?"
2021-04-09 23:02:54,wallstreetbets,"Son of a bitch, I'm in!"
2021-04-10 01:26:17,wallstreetbets,don't think you know what tits up means
2021-04-10 10:56:47,wallstreetbets,Gotcha
2021-04-10 00:32:54,wallstreetbets,"Oh God no. VXX is for puts unless you reasonably expect a massive spike in volatility is imminent. Kinda like SPXS, 90% of the time if you buy a put it'll print and after a spike has happened is just an even better time to buy puts."
2021-04-09 22:58:12,wallstreetbets,So the move is puts?
2021-04-09 23:13:12,wallstreetbets,Thank you!

2021-04-10 08:31:18,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, but never having the opportunity to learn something is not the same as not having the ability to comprehend a subject. I'm a product of the American school system. They taught me nothing. So I'm trying to learn on my own so that I can have a more diverse portfolio than just a 401k plan. Because of that I may on occasion ask a stupid question or two."
2021-04-10 11:50:07,wallstreetbets,"IT’S A COUNTRY, NOT A COMPANY YOU CAN PLAY LIKE MONOPOLY!"
2021-04-10 01:22:39,wallstreetbets,Oh I see your point. Yeah I'm just talking about my favorite ticker
2021-04-09 23:16:01,wallstreetbets,No it's a joke
2021-04-09 22:37:15,wallstreetbets,I think there's a lot of opportunity to buy and write actually and you're on to it with the day or two idea
2021-04-10 00:34:28,wallstreetbets,"For *writing* puts, you mean, correct?"
2021-04-09 23:03:28,wallstreetbets,"I am only judging on what happened with SCR.TO

The price didn't really move until after the reverse split was completed and then it went on a steady decline. If I were to make a play on this it would definitely be puts after the reverse split.

SCR.TO did do a 10:1 on a very hyped stock vs the 4:1 on a far less hyped stock so I doubt movement will be as severe."
2021-04-09 23:35:22,wallstreetbets,They're about to be 4x expensive which sucks
2021-04-09 22:51:23,wallstreetbets,Y'all got some of that hopium
2021-04-10 11:35:44,wallstreetbets,"Dude why are you making this more complicated?

It just means that VXX is combining 4 shares into 1.

So if the price of 4 shares is $100, after the reverse split the price of 1 share is $100."
2021-04-10 00:44:38,wallstreetbets,"Oh, um, right. That is correct, I meant to say *writing* puts... silly me"
2021-04-10 00:50:41,wallstreetbets,Those VIX funds are a wasting asset by design...buying short dated put contracts isn't a bad strategy. I normally buy a cheap OTM call to go along with slightly OTM puts in case there's a volatility spike. Only way you lose is when there isn't any movement.
2021-04-10 00:47:31,wallstreetbets,"Are being serious here? VXX is not a stock, it attempts to track volatility and is designed to go down over time. They have to do reverse splits now and then. Just look up the all time chart of any products attempting to track volatility"
2021-04-09 23:48:58,wallstreetbets,How’s that
2021-04-10 13:09:56,wallstreetbets,Just having fun
2021-04-10 16:43:39,wallstreetbets,"Wouldnt that decrease the total value of it to a quarter, or am I getting trolled.

Shouldnt it go from 4 shares of $100 to 1 share of $400-ish?"
2021-04-10 00:45:23,wallstreetbets,I think buying puts on VXX is a sucker's bet in the long run
2021-04-10 01:01:45,wallstreetbets,ATM straddles on VIX are a losing bet in the long run
2021-04-10 01:22:11,wallstreetbets,oh he's serious... I can't believe this dude is giving advice to someone when he doesn't even know what VXX tracks lol

2021-04-10 16:47:04,wallstreetbets,"Well yes,

4 shares = $100 total

1 share = $100 total (post reverse split)

You just think that those 4 shares cost $100 each, but they cost $25 each, and after the reverse that 1 share goes to $100"
2021-04-10 00:49:29,wallstreetbets,"Oh absolutely. Have you seen how high that thing peaks when it pops? And it does it a lot. 

Plus, if you buy puts but VXX goes down that also means volatility is going down so you'll get IV crushed."
2021-04-10 08:49:03,wallstreetbets,Buying weekly puts on vol has been free money since last year. What are you smoking
2021-04-10 09:06:46,wallstreetbets,IV on puts on vol products is not the same as broad market iv...

2021-04-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Added 34 more shares today @165. Wifey thinks I only have a total of $200 invested in GME instead of 200 shares. Moon or moron I dont care. Let’s go RC! Hodl to the moon! 💎🙌🦧🍌💪🏼 
2021-04-09 22:18:53,wallstreetbets,Weird. My side piece told me her husband has $200 in GME

2021-04-10 18:02:08,wallstreetbets,"Jesus. Now you're probably fucked both ways. Either you get caught holding the bag and end up divorced, creating a situation where you have to give up or liquefy shares;

OR

You make off with a fortune, then get served papers where your wife uses this incident as her excuse to divorce and she still gets her share."
2021-04-10 04:21:06,wallstreetbets,This hole gme shit annoyes me so much. It don't get why it's even discussed anymore. It's over. I came her for financial discussions and good input.

2021-04-10 01:02:29,wallstreetbets,Thanks for enlightening me. I was unaware
2021-04-10 04:52:44,wallstreetbets,"Well I live from an income replacing allowance for handicapped people, my wife cleans and cooks for the elderly (or bourgeois people who buy these service cheques intended to help needy people so they can have a tax deductible cleaning person) So we don't have much.

I had some reserves because in 2002 I had a car accident as a passenger and insurance paid me, I borrowed extra from the bank and bought and renovated a tiny tiny apartment for 64k € and managed to sell it later for about 97k. After paying off what was still due of the loan, and paying back my mother who had written down every time she ever helped me in my life with money. I got my drivers license with the money, bought a second hand car, had solar panels put on the roof and then let the bank decide for me what to do with the rest but since 2016 the bank investments have been losing money and I decided to take all except for a dividend paying fund and put the money from those in GME, expecting to become a millionaire.

It wasn't money that we where ever going to use because when it's gone, well it's gone. You know how it is when you have a sum of money that is more than you ever had but are afraid to spend... because doing so puts you back at having nothing. I spent a good chunk of that money"

2021-04-10 14:42:36,wallstreetbets,"Nobody is really buying a lot. The volume is pathetic. Its lower than its ever been so when some buy a few shares at 180+, it does nothing for the stock. All the major buying was concentrated at 190+ and again around 135. This leads to shorts going in on days of a slow market and nobody is stepping up on the retail side to keep the buy pressure up. Just little buys from poor people that end up getting faded after 20 minutes. Unless some major firm or hedge fund decides to long GME, I personally believe shorts and call sellers are going to beat down retail till their stop losses get taken out.

(THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE) I could also be wrong, and it rockets with retail gaining interest, but VWAP is a big indicator of where buying has been concentrated."
2021-04-10 04:09:49,wallstreetbets,"Relax. Retail is on the sideline on this. Nothing happens rn because there are major forces at play. Sit and wait. 

What makes waiting even easier: Even if there is no squeeze at all GameStop should be a great long term play."

Now I expect renewed Ant IPO in a few months. We may see 300 EOY easily.


They also had an option to drag investigation for years. They did not, they cut the pain. It’s a mercy of sorts, since business needs certainty to attract talent and cut deals."

This time they actually fined them. I don’t know how anyone can think that this won’t actually make them drop at least 20%. It implies that the government is going to shrink the company; $2.8 billion is pennies to them, but this is sending a signal. Just because this was “priced in” doesn’t mean it isn’t going to happen and could have further ramifications."

2021-04-09 23:38:01,wallstreetbets,Damn jack is crying for his mah
2021-04-10 00:02:52,wallstreetbets,Uh oh
2021-04-10 03:34:51,wallstreetbets,But wht about the US-China trade tensions. Surely theres gonn be a huge pressure on Chinese ADRs no?
2021-04-10 08:29:49,wallstreetbets,Well there goes the dividend :(
2021-04-10 09:08:45,wallstreetbets,"Wait, China has a market regulator?"
2021-04-10 10:33:17,wallstreetbets,"Now that is a fine, SEC you seeing this lil'bitch fines"
2021-04-10 10:46:45,wallstreetbets,glad i sold BABA
2021-04-10 10:49:19,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-10 12:42:33,wallstreetbets,Jack Ma is still getting spank by the CCP.
2021-04-10 13:12:33,wallstreetbets,And we should invest in Nio? Hahahaha.....!
2021-04-10 13:27:46,wallstreetbets,Alibaba is so undervalued. If/when the CCP gets bored of this they’ll go to the moon
2021-04-10 13:29:12,wallstreetbets,Does anyone have a guess on when China will be done pushing alibaba around?
2021-04-10 15:14:34,wallstreetbets,Puts on baba it is then
2021-04-10 15:49:25,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't this have anything to do with the fact that Winnie the Pooh is pissed of at jack ma?
2021-04-10 08:33:20,wallstreetbets,"Everyone here is saying “bullish” because they’re sitting on bags. The fact is, the CCP is sending a great message - get too big and we will trim you back. Baba’s growth is capped. You’ll beat inflation."
2021-04-09 21:58:46,wallstreetbets,Expected was $2.801
2021-04-10 01:13:54,wallstreetbets,"while most of the time that's meme, for this fine i think there can be another way to look at it. For a company as big as Alibaba, they don't get slapped the fine from the dark. They have people on this inside who hears what's going on. So the outcome of the ""investigation"" is kind of negotiated behind the curtains. When the ""ruling"" is out, that means they've finished the negotiations and this thing is a thing of the past. The money lost due to the fine is already priced in, and now the uncertainty is gone.

Anyways I dont have a position in BABA, but just my 2 cents."
2021-04-09 22:19:37,wallstreetbets,I came here to warn people NOT to buy OTM puts... The market has already priced this in. May dip a little and reverse immediately
2021-04-10 03:49:58,wallstreetbets,"Shit better rise, I'm about to bet money I don't have on this one. It's a sure thing!"
2021-04-09 23:20:53,wallstreetbets,This ^. Hopefully this ends alibabas anti monopoly investigation for the time being. They’ve been in somewhat of an impasse since December
2021-04-10 11:58:14,wallstreetbets,300 EOY? It was just 300 in October/November.... I'm thinking 300 by Summer and 350 by EOY...
2021-04-10 00:52:49,wallstreetbets,Ant group is to be restructured and overseen by the Central Bank of China. I don’t think there will be an IPO.
2021-04-09 23:23:24,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes paying the bribe isn't enough, you have to show you'll always kiss the ring without question, but Jackie boy one day decided to posit some questions around Chinese banks and now... well, he's staring at a different type of ring that's demanding to be kissed."
2021-04-10 03:42:46,wallstreetbets,Or they pissed on the wrong party leader.
2021-04-10 08:24:41,wallstreetbets,He called the CCP companies pawn shops lol.
2021-04-10 01:40:23,wallstreetbets,"Funny stuff, but I don’t think it’s about bribes. You can say a lot of things about Xi but he cleaned house on that old style corruption. Big people went down during his purges, big people still do.

The Party doesn’t need money and they don’t care about horse-trading politic the way US parties do. They want power and validation, all the time and from everywhere. Jack Ma embarrassed the Party and that’s why this happened."
2021-04-10 01:32:39,wallstreetbets,I was gonna upvote but you’re sitting right at 69 so i j want you to know I like the comment
2021-04-10 14:11:35,wallstreetbets,The fine IS the bribe.
2021-04-10 00:52:46,wallstreetbets,"This could mean the long overarching shadow of investigations could finally be over for Baba. Stock was too low IMO from FUD (rightfully so). From talks of potential delisting, harsher penalties from the Chinese govt, we had no idea when penalties would be struck. I honestly think this news is more bullish than not. Most of the FUD can now be gone but still potential of US delisting (although not in the near future) and Chinese govt still breathing down their necks but not so much. We will see"
2021-04-10 09:33:10,wallstreetbets,"They made $20B last year, and they have $100B+ in assets."
2021-04-10 12:35:57,wallstreetbets,"4% of 2020 sales, 15% of 2020 profit (if I mathed correctly)."
2021-04-10 09:06:27,wallstreetbets,Market only wants certainty this will do the trick
2021-04-09 22:53:33,wallstreetbets,No shit!! Hard labor too!! He hating it
2021-04-09 22:54:09,wallstreetbets,"Well the US fed govt is ~95%, but I get your point. China is a rule by law country. Using geolocation on your phone is technically illegal. Anyone could get popped for anything, anywhere and anytime."
2021-04-10 05:26:19,wallstreetbets,"According to who, the CCP? Sounds legit"
2021-04-10 11:34:00,wallstreetbets,Or it may not drop at all ✌️
2021-04-10 10:12:34,wallstreetbets,225
2021-04-10 17:59:45,wallstreetbets,Either 211 or 232
2021-04-10 05:05:30,wallstreetbets,"Top comment. Alibaba has given a lot of legit businesses a safe and trusty platform to make money online which is getting stronger every year. The pandemic spending spree should have pushed BABA to 300 plus but fuck the Chinese government.

Meanwhile you got Amazon going up and up while avoiding tax, treating workers like tools and slowly crushing small sellers on their marketplace. World is upside down.

Bottom line: this share is VERY undervalued. I sold around 270 but tempted to go back in BIG."
2021-04-10 02:57:10,wallstreetbets,This fine is a slap on the wrist.
2021-04-09 22:06:40,wallstreetbets,"I thought he was already out, no?"
2021-04-10 00:11:07,wallstreetbets,He wanted Alibaba to have greater freedom with the finances of China and that the banks were holding them back. All the banks and government officials were there and did not like that he wanted to have greater control and wealth so they told him fuck off.
2021-04-09 22:50:06,wallstreetbets,"I agree. He made the mistake of criticizing the Chinese govt in public, of being perceived as telling them what to do. He promptly “disappeared” for several weeks.

He should go back to doing oddball Michael Jackson shit and enjoy his billions, would be better for the company at this point."
2021-04-10 06:03:39,wallstreetbets,"Or just a tool the state uses to regulate, for reference see standard oil antitrust"
2021-04-10 19:55:09,wallstreetbets,"> Incase anyone don’t know Alibaba is china ‘s ( amazon + PayPal + Facebook + Tesla + azure cloud + aws ...+++ many more )COMBINED

Let's take the devil's advocate for a sec. Let's say what you're saying is true.

Then why would China keep fucking this company over and over again? Isn't that like shooting oneself in the foot repeatedly? Now that we know that the CCP DOESN'T want Alibaba to succeed, (because if they did, why go through all this shit), and that the CCP has the power to keep fucking shit up for Alibaba in case it gets too big again, why even believe that it's a value + growth stonk?"
2021-04-10 01:33:06,wallstreetbets,"If Warren Buffett’s business partner were to purchase BABA at a stake of 19% of his entire portfolio last week, would you change your mind?

https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html"
2021-04-09 23:00:39,wallstreetbets,Drop 20%?! Lol bet it drops 5% at open and recovers.  This is pocket change.  They can fine up to 10%.  The fine was 4%.
2021-04-09 23:07:03,wallstreetbets,If baba were to drop 20% it would end the week at 300+ from the panic buying after the dip
2021-04-10 00:25:50,wallstreetbets,"It's just a guess of mine, but the way I saw it is the big fine is a possible signal that they are not planning to break the company up. I thought for sure they would break it up before this massive fine. Of course, it's still possible, but I feel it's less likely now."
2021-04-10 01:38:24,wallstreetbets,"You must be new to the CCP. They do not curb their words, especially when on the public stage. If they planned to continue pursuing other, larger punishments, it would be the headline. The probe has ended, and they found it was only worth 2.8b in damages, which is like a speeding ticket for you.

This is super bullish. Always think what this means two steps from now. The mystery of what is going to happen is over. That’s good news."
2021-04-09 23:06:43,wallstreetbets,Nope rocketing
2021-04-09 21:55:14,wallstreetbets,Chinese govt keeps on checking our babs.
2021-04-09 22:10:57,wallstreetbets,"Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words.

2021-04-10 04:47:33,wallstreetbets,Antitrust was priced in
2021-04-10 01:43:45,wallstreetbets,"So this is why BABA has gone in the dirt when most other stocks have rallied. Makes sense

Good old fashioned sell the rumor buy the news"
2021-04-10 08:02:03,wallstreetbets,"So you mean the Chinese system is exactly like the SEC in the US were its all negotiated behind the scenes and a token wrist slap is delivered and they get to go on raping and pillaging.....   

Maybe the SEC could at least ask their Chinese counterparts how they had the backbone to level a $2.8 billion fine .... because honestly, I'd be pretty impressed if the SEC managed to dish out fines in the millions once in awhile against the BS the HF's regularly pull, let alone in the billions 🤣"
2021-04-10 19:05:17,wallstreetbets,Its nice you believe China negatiats.
2021-04-09 22:32:22,wallstreetbets,So calls
2021-04-10 07:14:09,wallstreetbets,As long as Jim  Cramer keeps his mouth shut it will go up.
2021-04-09 23:23:44,wallstreetbets,"I had April calls 275, that were printing fine until they stopped couple of months ago if there is a dip I’m going to buy heavily. With whatever I have left after these 2 months of palantir diamond handing ;). Still hold a few may 265 calls. Might just keep them for fun, but not sure we can bridge the gap this large in a 1.5 months"
2021-04-10 01:12:01,wallstreetbets,There will be. It’s still a business even if it’s overseen
2021-04-10 03:16:11,wallstreetbets,"They would punish Jack not the company.  Couple years ago there was a infant formula scandal, where tainted formula exported from china killed infants. Out of something like 8 executives 4 got executed, the other 4 life. Babies died and at least that is some Justice. 

Personally I think China's regulatory bodies are a lot stronger and more effective than any on the west's.

I also think they did more justice than we've seen from our crony capitalists."
2021-04-10 03:07:18,wallstreetbets,"Jack Ma: I can has little deregulation, as a treat? =)
Chairman Xi: I'm about to end this man's entire career."
2021-04-10 04:25:09,wallstreetbets,"The party wants power and validation but they also want money, don't kid yourself. The thing is high up party officials are already getting so much bribe money a few milly is a pittance."
2021-04-10 05:43:45,wallstreetbets,"Not quite. The big straw was the Ant Financial IPO. Basically, Alipay makes a lot of money with financial products like consumer loans, because they take a huge part of the spread, while state owned banks have to provide the financial backbone for those loans and don't get much from it. This was okay, as Alipay has been a nationwide experiment in technology in consumer finance and has accelerated the growth of many industries. 

But Ant Financial decided to IPO, and the ownership structure of the IPO was...quite opaque to say the least. There were a handful of billionaires that would have indirectly stood to have controlling interest in the whole enterprise.

This was not OK to the CPC, and they of course were asking questions and wanted to put the brakes on it. When Jack Ma complained in public about the IPO being halted and criticized the party for it, the government was fucking pissed. They helped deliver golden goose egg and now they wanted to sell it off to some billionaires through some shady mangled web of an ownership structure. In this context, Jack's criticisms were really uncalled for."
2021-04-10 10:08:31,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
2021-04-10 00:12:53,wallstreetbets,I mean that number is kinda bogus though if the government brings charges against someone and they think they are going to lose they just drop the case so it doesn't equal a loss it's just juking the stats
2021-04-10 01:08:42,wallstreetbets,probably 99% for poor people and 50% for rich people in america
2021-04-10 08:03:10,wallstreetbets,BUTT FUCK THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT!
2021-04-10 09:54:02,wallstreetbets,Compared to only a few million our institutions here usually get for stealing billions through market manipulation?
2021-04-09 22:12:13,wallstreetbets,"Yes he ""stepped down"" but he still very much influences what Baba does. People seem to forget that 80% of the board are extremely loyal to Jack. He still hold a significant financial influence in the company as well. On paper, he still hold 6.22% of Baba and a seat of the board. The Chinese government knows until Jack is ""out"" they can't control Baba."
2021-04-10 05:29:37,wallstreetbets,Telling someone to fuck off isn’t what they do in China. They put him behind bars until he agrees to fuck off.
2021-04-10 06:27:24,wallstreetbets,"Agreed , lotsa folks think he approach this topic  too arrogantly 

Does he know what he said or act will affect shareholder?  Since then ant ipo cancel and baba stonk drop  30%"
2021-04-10 01:37:08,wallstreetbets,No. 37 million is nothing to him and it seems more of a reason behind his purchase of the stock.
2021-04-10 02:21:55,wallstreetbets,"Bullish on baba. Dang forgot that even happened. Although sometimes even inside investors like Elizabeth warren picks backfired. She bought a lot of shares of Tesla at ~$850.
Although this guy is an actual investor so he prob knows what he’s doing more so than warren and her team but who knows"
2021-04-09 23:31:38,wallstreetbets,we’ll see...
2021-04-09 23:09:44,wallstreetbets,"I'm more interested in what the bad words are. Fuck, shit, bitch, cunt, whore, asshole, cocksucker..."
2021-04-09 23:08:25,wallstreetbets,No better than the chinese tsk tsk
2021-04-09 22:17:41,wallstreetbets,Thanks bot for the heads up
2021-04-10 09:50:43,wallstreetbets,"The Chinese SEC counterpart is part of the CCP, they'll drag your wife's boyfriend to the Gulag if you don't pay your fines."
2021-04-09 22:45:10,wallstreetbets,"Even better, LEAPS"
2021-04-10 11:43:00,wallstreetbets,"""If there is a dip"" bro this IS the dip...look at the fucking chart since November 2020..."
2021-04-10 01:14:52,wallstreetbets,How can a business truly be ‘public’ as in put shareholders first (especially if they list in the US) if they are to be overseen by China’s central bank?
2021-04-10 03:32:53,wallstreetbets,"Not quite, they only executed 2 people... one dairy farmer and one salesman. 4 execs got prison time but only one exec in jail for life. Same sentiment tho, bc the company is still doing great. But it doesn’t matter where it is capitalism will always throw the little guy under the bus (robbinghood)"
2021-04-10 09:32:05,wallstreetbets,"Bro,  lay off the Chinese penis sucking for a day"
2021-04-10 08:00:36,wallstreetbets,They have to punish the company to set an example. They cannot punish Jack because he is a very admired figure among the Chinese people. He cannot be a martyr.
2021-04-10 10:42:57,wallstreetbets,"The opaque ownership was actually princrlings. 

Basically a group of connected politburo families. 

Ma brought in big CCP connections in 2012 to buy in to ANT and it kinda backfired. 

Additionally the whole operational structure of ANT posed undue risk on the financial system.

ANT is still a very good business. Will IPO and grow in to a behemoth"
2021-04-10 00:51:57,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Everyone knows that. But if you cowboy up and then the govt says “OK then, we’ll see you in court” you should probably shit your pants."
2021-04-10 01:22:45,wallstreetbets,"Probably less for rich people. Enforcement tends to be sharp downwards, blunt upwards."
2021-04-10 05:34:41,wallstreetbets,He wasn't in jail.  He was told to lay low and stfu at home.
2021-04-10 01:40:01,wallstreetbets,Nothing? It’s his 3rd largest holding now.
2021-04-10 02:27:55,wallstreetbets,"He’s the real deal. Him and buffet don’t buy to trade, they buy after meticulous research, and probably a fair amount of insider knowledge of we’re being realistic here. This, of course, doesn’t mean they are infallible. Look at Kraft. However it’s obvious if you’re going to follow anyone, these guys are great picks to copy."
2021-04-10 13:04:04,wallstreetbets,And take your lambo and tendies.
2021-04-10 19:37:39,wallstreetbets,Bought 2023 LEAPS on Friday at the $240 strike. I looked at price history and these LEAPS are massively on sale from what they were priced at 2 months ago. IV is sub 40%.
2021-04-10 01:33:31,wallstreetbets,shares are the way to go with BABA...
2021-04-10 12:35:12,wallstreetbets,"310 -> 220   -  not a dip

220 -> 210  -  Buy the fucking dip!"
2021-04-10 14:26:55,wallstreetbets,I already bought in late December and was doing fine until 2 month ago...
2021-04-10 09:29:03,wallstreetbets,"Lowkey this how all banks operate, in the US, banks are tightly controlled by the Fed, which is a unique public-private institution."
2021-04-10 01:15:38,wallstreetbets,A lot of publicly traded companies are controlled by national governments. It’s way to common outside USA.
2021-04-10 01:18:42,wallstreetbets,Same way every other public Chinese company is.
2021-04-10 06:28:18,wallstreetbets,Have you not heard of public internet there 😊
2021-04-10 10:45:35,wallstreetbets,"Lol they are literally going to form a financial holding company. 

How tf do u expect em not to have PBOC oversight 🤣🤣"

2021-04-10 11:18:34,wallstreetbets,That's racist
2021-04-10 12:01:22,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough. I just think the story needs to be told, as most people just hear it's the CPC cracking down on Jack Ma for ""complaining"" which kind of misses the main point."
2021-04-10 00:57:12,wallstreetbets,"I mean if the feds are honestly after you they probably have been watching you and stacking evidence against you for a while they have unlimited money time and people working

And I can't remember ( not a lawyer but family is) but if they drop a case against you I believe they can just come after you again at later time because there wasn't a verdict"
2021-04-10 02:25:22,wallstreetbets,For a billionaire 37 million is nothing. I do not trust Chinese based companies.
2021-04-10 05:32:37,wallstreetbets,Is that why buffett has been trailing the sp500 for the last 20 yrs?
2021-04-10 01:59:54,wallstreetbets,So shares of LEAPS?
2021-04-10 12:31:04,wallstreetbets,"Dude callin everything racist, like the comment above you, which isn't racist (the one he followed up with after is) is how you get people to stop giving a fuck about whats racist and what isn't."
2021-04-10 11:19:04,wallstreetbets,“Chinese penis so small”
2021-04-10 12:06:29,wallstreetbets,Yeah definitely.
2021-04-10 01:01:43,wallstreetbets,The feds don’t need evidence to convict
2021-04-10 02:30:24,wallstreetbets,"To each their own. A dollar I make in the Chinese market is the same dollar I’d made in the US market. I added another 20k in summer calls yesterday in BABA, not because I love China, but because BABA is a good investment in a prime position to rally. Nothing more, nothing less."
2021-04-10 05:54:54,wallstreetbets,"Lol why are you here kid. If you’re going to broaden this topic out this wide, then why are you here. Go dollar cost average into the S&P, no point in wasting your time on a investing sub. However, don’t leave just yet, I want to come back in 3 months and say I told you so about BABA.

RemindME! 90 days “$42k Call Options Update.”"
2021-04-10 14:54:31,wallstreetbets,Or LEAPs of weeklies
2021-04-10 13:07:34,wallstreetbets,You're defending a racist on forum for investors/degenerate gamblers. If you care about eliminating racism you condemn those being racist. But you yourself are racist.
2021-04-10 11:37:18,wallstreetbets,Still bigger than yours.
2021-04-10 01:10:18,wallstreetbets,"In order to achieve a conviction the government has to prove without a reasonable doubt you are guilty they need evidence to do this

So yes they do but like I said if you get indicted they probably already have that so you are fucked they don't like losing"
2021-04-10 10:26:02,wallstreetbets,I understand your position. Investing in China is a gamble. I have been burned one too many times with corruption and lies in the company. When it comes to stocks I deal with less corrupt and risky chances.

2021-04-10 14:13:29,wallstreetbets,Nah dude the problem is you don't understand what you're talking about and just calling everyone/everything racist haha. I'm not defending the guy but you're so reactive and triggered - I literally said that his dumbass response about Chinese dicks being small IS racist. But enjoy the miserable worldview you've built for yourself; no one gives a fuck about your attempts to look self-righteous especially when you come off as a twat.

2021-04-10 01:29:46,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, someone can be tried multiple times. It takes a lot to get an indictment, evidence-wise. So yes, evidence is required. That’s why it’s such major news when a govt bungles a case (fed, state, or local). If it gets bungled. It’s usually the human factor (witnesses, prosecutor, jury, judge, etc.) not the evidence, that makes a case fall apart in court."

2021-04-09 21:43:11,wallstreetbets,Nok nok who’s there it’s the margin man
2021-04-09 21:51:47,wallstreetbets,That’s a nice swift kick in the dick
2021-04-09 22:22:44,wallstreetbets,"You need to sell some calls and try to make your money back, even if it’s just a bit."
2021-04-09 23:39:14,wallstreetbets,NOK seems to hit resistance at 4.01 and support at 3.99.  Gl on those leaps.
2021-04-09 22:42:35,wallstreetbets,"I've snapped a [20 year chart](https://imgur.com/a/L6JYmJF). The last time it was above $10 was early 2011. I'm hard pressed to imagine the recent spike was anything but an anomaly.  However I hold a small long position (at $3.83) because I think it will benefit from 5G deployments. I don't expect anything crazy, but I don't really see a lot of downside either.  It's interesting how it ran up to above $40 in 2007, well above where it had been.  The iPhone was announced in mid 2007 and of course that was largely the death for Nokia's handset business, though the NOK still rallied into year's end. As someone who grew up in the heyday of Nokia mobiles, before even color displays,I will always associate them with those in my head.

2020 NOK  EPS was -$0.53 US [\[20-F report\],](https://www.nokia.com/system/files/2021-03/Nokia_Form_20F_2020.pdf)while their competitor Ericsson had a positive 61 cents and ERIC stock significantly outperformed NOK in the past 6 months. Their other primary competitor is Huawei. I don't have time or patience to read t[heir report](https://www-file.huawei.com/minisite/media/annual_report/annual_report_2020_en.pdf) (nor would I necessarily trust it), but who in their right mind would want a Chinese company having anything to do with their 5g network?"
2021-04-09 21:41:24,wallstreetbets,uh....they won't
2021-04-09 21:41:02,wallstreetbets,Not gonna happen my man

2021-04-09 22:30:56,wallstreetbets,I had $4.50 calls that expired worthless today. I feel the pain..

2021-04-10 01:06:01,wallstreetbets,Real advice:  SELL now and invest in something else.  You'd have a better chance at making back your loss than waiting for NOK to hit the lottery.
2021-04-10 01:11:58,wallstreetbets,"Me too, think they’re fucked. Should have sold in January"
2021-04-10 02:24:44,wallstreetbets,nok will move 4 cents between now and 2023

2021-04-10 13:30:17,wallstreetbets,"Bought some 2023 5c leaps, they are dirt cheap rn, 0.73$. You should probably take some lower strike to increase your chances of not bag holding"

oh shit I'm so sorry"

Nokia stock is not going anywhere even with 5g you will be lucky if it gets to 6"
2021-04-10 11:37:13,wallstreetbets,"In Jan when NOK spiked, I bought 15K worth of leaps (2023 exp), 1 month later they had lost half their value, I don't play with NOK no more. It settled around $4/share, someone big wants it there."

2021-04-09 22:32:15,wallstreetbets,I’ll sell half if they go back to $30 and move those to some other stocks
2021-04-10 10:16:05,wallstreetbets,NOK has 30% of the world’s 5G so I am going to stick to my calls they will prevail with some volatility and $5.50-$6 all I need anything more is just a blessing
2021-04-09 21:42:09,wallstreetbets,I’ll wait I have 9 more months to go

2021-04-10 10:06:17,wallstreetbets,$9.79 Jan I’ll make $70K if it hits where it was
2021-04-10 10:03:39,wallstreetbets,If it gets to $6 I will be positive get some gains and run
2021-04-10 10:25:37,wallstreetbets,27-28% approximately **excluding** China according to their own report. But yeah it might get to those levels.
2021-04-09 22:11:15,wallstreetbets,"Alright let's see, so it closed at 4.03 today? 

That means it will be approximately  4.11 in 9 months give or take 3 cents."
2021-04-10 11:59:02,wallstreetbets,"If you believe nokia will gain in the coming years (i think it will despite how terribly managed the company is and how toxic the stock is), grab the 3C 2023."
2021-04-09 22:01:30,wallstreetbets,"dang, when did you place this? don't remember $10 strike being $42"
2021-04-10 10:19:24,wallstreetbets,6 by time your leaps expire 😂
2021-04-09 23:23:59,wallstreetbets,That was tough to read

2021-04-09 21:46:51,wallstreetbets,Transitory inflation due to supply bottleneck especially after the cargo ship got stuck in the Suez Canal for a few days. Listen to what JPow said in details instead of just reading headlines.

2021-04-09 21:46:26,wallstreetbets,Demand for stuff in the US is increasing so much that containers are going back to asia empty just so they can be filled again and sent sent back over.  So many tendies and not enough services open so time to buy goods.  Supply and demand.
2021-04-09 22:49:54,wallstreetbets,"The increase in freight prices might have nothing to do with inflation. The shipping lines sold some of their vessels and were broken down for scrap metals. This might just the ramifications of that and a lot of factories are also closed in the US and Europe, so that also contributes. Do you know any other sites likes this by the way? I'm really interested in this type of stuff... Like shipping and trade lanes and such 😄"
2021-04-10 03:13:33,wallstreetbets,Gold is down 10 percent from 6 months ago. I mean it's just an example but every thing listed had to do with supply chains. Is there some baseline we can go off of where supply and demand for a product has remained the same throughout these months? If we know of one then we can make the assumptions that inflation is going up. Not denying it is but yeah i have no clue

We are literally crashing up. Money printer go brrrrr. Every country that has experienced high inflation had this happen before the inflation came....

Average spx increase is 8% we are up over 47% in one year when alot of people are unemployed.

Think it's because we were recovering from a crash and that's why?

I'm sorry your fake NFL jersey from ebay was 40$ instead of 32.  I truly am.   RIP DMX.

As the pandemic spread out from its Asian epicentre, countries implemented lockdowns, halting economic movements and production. Many factories closed temporarily, causing large numbers of containers to be stopped at ports. To stabilize costs and the erosion of ocean rates, carriers reduced the number of vessels out at sea. Not only did this put the brakes on import and export, it also meant empty containers were not picked up. This was especially significant for Asian traders, who couldn't retrieve empty containers from North America."

what you want to look for is an LTL carrier as the bulk and whole freight carriers are sucking air and having issues moving freight because of the disruptions at factories. ltl has a greater ability to move freight because they have more equipment.

there are economist that think you can issue debt and think of it as a good thing because it is a surplus for the private sector. 

they are dumb because the government has to pay a interest rate leading to a increase in the money supply... also to remove the inflation aspect you issue taxes that are then used to destroy money by paying off the debt.

the US government doesn't pay off the debt with taxes so you just create a feed back loop of increased inflation. 

we are fucked as this is now US policy called MMT. we have seen what happens multiple fucking times when government issues debt beyond x point the system collapses. 

the only way to counter the debt is through negative interest rates which acts like a loan so now you have two central banks or raising taxes to balance it out. 

it is communism. the government issues funding then taxes the top earners or the population to suppress private demand and recoup a % of the dollars they issue.

it is how the fucking fed works but using taxes instead of interest rates to control the money supply which is worse because are a negative incentive to hide your money while a loan payback puts pressure to increase out and you can't hide not paying the premium as it is mostly paid first before the principle."

they don't have enough people to move containers off ships and onto trucks and currently freight rates have also increased because of a lack of drivers. reject rates are up above 20% currently. 

when you bottleneck the system that doesn't have any slack it seizes up and becomes near impossible to catch back up unless you decrease demand or increase output above normal averages. 

producers inflation over the last 12 months has increased by 4% for finished goods here is the report. 

unprocessed increased by 9%.

https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm

in the last 3 months Monthly inflation has averaged a 1% gain. not annul inflation but monthly gains.

at current rate increases puts production inflation near 12% if it continues and as every person is saying expect prices to rise that isn't a good sign. 

https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm


Unprocessed goods for intermediate demand: Prices for unprocessed goods for intermediate 
demand moved up 9.3 percent in March, the largest rise since a 12.3-percent increase in November 
2006. Over 80 percent of the broad-based March advance can be traced to a 22.3-percent jump in the 
index for unprocessed energy materials. Prices for unprocessed nonfood materials less energy and for 
unprocessed foodstuffs and feedstuffs rose 3.2 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively. For the 12

2021-04-10 10:41:29,wallstreetbets,"Providing liquidity for purchasing Financial assets, especially treasury bonds, is very different than simply providing liquidity (That's Zimbabwe style central banking 😂). These transactions are all on the secondary markets. So at fair value. Also, whenever the FED buys assets to investment banks, the Banks balance sheets did not get inflated, it just got restructured, on their asset side. 

Most of the assets acquired are bonds, especially treasury bonds, with a date of maturity. Some will reach this date soon. The FED has already reduced their balance sheet after some bonds were paid out."
2021-04-10 03:08:25,wallstreetbets,"You misunderstood, I’m not saying it’s all the Suez, I’m saying the Suez helped make a problem that already existed even worse. Supply chains were disrupted by coronavirus and the economic shut down. Now everything is opening and starting to boom. THEN the Suez Canal fiasco happened which inflated an already expensive rate of shipping costs due to everyone preparing for the economy to open and trying to keep up with demand. This is considered to be temporary inflation as things get back to normal."

2021-04-09 22:15:13,wallstreetbets,"No one said there's no inflation.

2021-04-10 12:17:49,wallstreetbets,"Yes, and it’s like you didn’t read my comment. Services (think Netflix) have not increased their prices and in many cases the prices have gone down. So you cannot say there is overall inflation. Many sectors are seeing deflation. 

The supply chain issues are temporary and will go away once all the trucks and ships that were sleeping during the pandemic wake up and start working again. There is nothing systemic happening that will permanently devalue ￼our currency."
2021-04-10 12:09:29,wallstreetbets,"Both. I mean, is that not the same reason people are saying inflation is high? Because there are worldwide supply chain disruptions?

People keep saying that prices at their grocery store are going up. But I haven’t noticed any  changes at all at my local Safeway (in fact, the 1.75L of my favorite whiskey has been discounted for the past year to $40 from $55+). Netflix hasn’t raised their fees. My iCloud subscription still costs $3/month like it always has. The only price increase I have noticed is gas, but the prices aren’t any higher than before the pandemic started. Simply put I think the high inflation naysayers are just a bunch of drama queens."

2021-04-10 00:50:56,wallstreetbets,"Economists say that inflation comes from an increase in the money supply or the velocity of money. So an increase due to a short term supply shock is not inflation. Shrinkflation in the store is also not inflation, nor is giving everyone money. People have to spend that money for inflation to rise.

Another thing to consider, if people use their money to pay debt, that is deflationary as it destroys the money."
2021-04-10 15:06:59,wallstreetbets,"The 10 year yield has spiked because no one wants to pay enough for the yield to be 0.6% when they know inflation is eating four times that yield.

The lowest risk-free rate of return investors are willing to settle for right now is 1.7%.  Because of inflation.  And bonds absolutely trade on risk versus yield profiles.  The prices get dictated by that, not the other other way around."
2021-04-10 11:16:16,wallstreetbets,But investors decide the bond price. You can decide what prices gives a sastifactory yield and only buy at that or lower. enough investors do that and the yield becomes that

2021-04-09 22:27:47,wallstreetbets,"it isn't altruism. import prices = domestic price  because of increased freight over the last 6 months. 

last shipment will hold us for a while. currently domestic suppliers are swamped because of the listed issues so i got prices locked in. 

i assumed we would run into this fuck fest back in 2020 but the pandemic was less than i thought. actual production issues in the US didn't start until around December as inventories ran low and the ports got backed up.

But, speaking about 2007, The amount of toxic assets bought in 2007 only represented a tiny amount of the FED and US treasury intervention program, (I think less than 5%) and they reported a loss on these immediately.
The other assets they bought to save FM, FM, AIG, the banks, as part of the bailout .. were far from toxic, and turned out to be good investment actually in the long term"
2021-04-10 10:20:21,wallstreetbets,"Yep thats what I thought, I am new to investing and in another trade I learned the hard way that you sell and not buy at the news but at least it was only 5%. Lesson learned"

2021-04-10 12:23:38,wallstreetbets,"I am an instructor at a public college. Enrollment has been steadily declining. Because state funding depends heavily on how many students are enrolled, there is pressure on staff to make it as easy as possibly for students to register for and see their classes through to the end. They will find scholarships or forgive fees if it means students will stay enrolled. Plus students no longer having to be on campus means there is an inherent cost savings of not having to travel (no paying for gas or for the bus). Overall I would say students are paying less for school now than they were before the pandemic started."
2021-04-10 15:31:36,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, this is exactly the point I am making in all of my replies to this thread. That some things like commodities are experiencing inflation, while others such as technology and services are not. Therefore you cannot make a blanket statement that inflation is up everywhere.

In fact, the commodity inflation is temporary, caused by supply chain issues stemming from the reopening. Those will go away once the world learns to be normal again. (It has been ""sleeping"" this entire time due to the pandemic.) The deflation caused by technology and more available workers is going to be permanent. Technology only makes things cheaper. For example, the cost to make EVs is going down exponentially (e.g., Tesla working on a $25,000 sedan). Telecommunication (e.g., Zoom) will drive down the cost of doing business since we won't have to waste as much time and money traveling, especially internationally. Companies can and will use the pandemic to permanently lay off workers, and only bring back the best of the bunch, further reducing the cost of doing business.

That is precisely why institutional money rotated out of recovery stocks and into risk-free FAANG last week. Next step is allocate some of that tech money into small cap, actual growth stocks with real future potential."
2021-04-10 12:53:35,wallstreetbets,"I am not sure what you are trying to say. Hasn’t inflation generally been going down since the 1980s and 1990s? I mean if you look at the 10 year treasury note yield it peaked in the 80s and has been coming down ever since. So thanks for proving my point, I guess. 😂"

After that you can call the textbook publishers and get them to change their books."
2021-04-10 11:24:48,wallstreetbets,"supply and demand is effectively market sentiment which is effectively investors as a collective. An individual investor can't decide a stock price but when everyone in the market think that the bond is worth less than it is now, the bond will drop in price. We have the same idea but it's just a difference in perspective and definition of investors."
2021-04-10 13:16:46,wallstreetbets,That sounds more like a bubble popping than a lack of inflation.  It's not like the price of milk isn't going up because people are choosing to drink less because of covid.
2021-04-10 13:05:16,wallstreetbets,10 year treasury note yield doesnt mean anything. youre conflating a bunch of different things.
2021-04-10 11:28:56,wallstreetbets,"It's not enough for the market to think it's worth less, they also need to sell it. This is what happened with the US 10Y bond, lots of investor sold it and it depreciated.

2021-04-10 17:01:08,wallstreetbets,I never got an award before!  Thank you very very much!  Very kind of you!
2021-04-09 21:08:25,wallstreetbets,No you didn’t do your dd? Yet you are acting like you know what direction the stock will move? Yikes
2021-04-09 21:09:31,wallstreetbets,"that was ""No, i did make the same bet you did"".  The DD checked out for the first time.  it doesn't anymore"
2021-04-09 21:18:48,wallstreetbets,Dude. You didn’t do your DD either. Your “DD” is listening to some YouTube scammer or 24 year old retard on Reddit.
2021-04-09 21:22:33,wallstreetbets,"I’ve probably put more than 50 hours into reading well thought out gme DD. 24 year olds can be smart lol don’t be ignorant. Also YouTube is a great source of information. Where would you recommend I get information, mainstream media? 😂"
2021-04-09 21:27:34,wallstreetbets,"Pro tip when you start saying “dO yOur rEseArCh” and “mAinStReaM mEdiA” you’ve joined a cult. And unfortunately you’ve joined a very stupid one. I work in finance and have read some of this “DD” and it’s hilariously wrong. Latest LOL is apes writing to the SEC about rule 801 changes which have zero to do with shorting and won’t make a difference.

You can do your own research by actually reading company filings. But yeah, apes are in a tough spot because you all refuse to listen to professionals who understand how markets work, short interest, options, collateral, margins, etc. and instead listen to charlatans. Good luck!"
2021-04-09 21:37:27,wallstreetbets,"When you say something as ignorant as not getting information from someone not above the age of 24 or from YouTube you have lost all credibility.

I’m not in a cult. I just like the stock 🚀"
2021-04-09 22:49:32,wallstreetbets,"Can’t wait to read your DD refuting it. Oh wait you won’t waste your time...Strangely no one else has given any decent DD refuting all the other DD people have spent hours/days/weeks compiling, except to quote other people with no DD."
2021-04-09 23:28:03,wallstreetbets,"Sure. Rule 801 changes are about how supplemental liquidity deposits from NSCC members (broker dealers, market makers, and banks not hedge funds)  are calculated. SLD has to do with settlement risk due to T+2 settlement. For example, Instead of NSCC asking for $500M at the start of a month based on a 24 month lookback on a member’s activity and increasing the SLD on opex, they’ll calculate daily, which means the member will post *less* collateral most of the time, but occasionally have to post *more* collateral , when there’s large settlement activity (high trading volume). This has literally nothing to do with a short squeeze, or fails, or anything to do with GME. 



Under this proposed calculation, NSCC would no longer need to estimate the potential liquidity need a Member’s activity could pose to NSCC based on activity that settled in the Lookback Period. Instead, the Supplemental Liquidity Obligation of a Member would be calculated based on the actual liquidity exposure that its daily activity would pose to NSCC on that particular day in the event of that Member’s default. The proposed change provides both NSCC and Members with a more reliable measure of the liquidity risks posed to NSCC by its Members’ daily settlement activity in calculating SLD requirements.

Pro-Forma Impact Study. The pro-forma impact study compared NSCC’s regulatory liquidity needs against the Qualifying Liquid Resources that were available between 2016 and 2020. The pro-forma analysis indicated that NSCC would expect between 1 and 3 Supplemental Liquidity Obligations per year, ranging in size between $1.0 billion to $5.4 billion in 2016 through 2019. In calendar year 2020, the impact study shows that available Qualifying Liquid Resources for each date would have eliminated potential Supplement Liquidity Obligations.

NSCC believes that the proposed changes to calculate and collect, when applicable, SLD on both a daily basis and, in some cases, on an intraday basis, and the proposed changes to implement an alternative pro rata calculation of Members’ SLD obligations in certain circumstances, as described above, would enable NSCC to better limit its liquidity exposures to Members’ daily settlement activity.
The proposed changes to calculate and collect, when applicable, SLD on a daily basis would improve NSCC’s ability to estimate its liquidity exposures in the calculation and collection of SLD by using daily activity, rather than estimating potential exposures based on activity in a look-back period."

You can buy my shares for the low price of 100k for the first share, 200k for the next share, 300k for the 3rd share, and so forth until I am fully paper-handed.

Anyone who isn’t in this for incredibly short term profits by making specific targets is a moron and anyone holding on for dear life waiting for this to moon over $10k is just a bag holder.

2021-04-10 11:35:16,wallstreetbets,"Overall, the buying experience was a huge pain in the ass and unsuccessful. I ended up buying via Steam.

As a Gamestop stockholder, I'm very disappointed with my shopping experience.

Woke up this morning to an email saying my order couldn't be processed. 

I tried a Discover credit card and debit via mobile, and via PC. Then tried a Capital One credit card. 

Multiple errors with Discover, even after approving purchase directly with Discover.

Furthest I could get was a page that looked like it was trying to do something, but nothing ever happened.

Bought via Steam with ease with same Discover card within seconds.

Gamestop definitely has some room for improvement for online purchasing."

2021-04-10 04:12:50,wallstreetbets,"Honestly it makes it super easy to expand my position.

I know everyone trading GME wants to become a gajillionaire, but I am literally just interested in more shares.

Unpopular opinion, I know, but I would be friggin jazzed if Andrew Shitron Left's ""back to $20 fast!"" prediction came true.

I'd probably just 10x my position right away."

2021-04-10 18:52:52,wallstreetbets,"Currently at 1020 shares, myself. Planning on buying 102 next week (10% more).

Especially if it dips.

At a certain point, either the stock will rise to it's real and fair value; which I personally believe in TSLA-like movements for this stock (at the very least) ; or it'll keep sinking and I'll eventually have enough shares to just let myself in the board room and be like ""Okay, Ryan. What's the scoop? I'm here to help.""

You do you; I know my strategy. And it hasn't changed since buying back in around $45/share.

Through individual autonomy retail investors stand to accomplish something amazing: owning a security that is impervious to illegal fuckery."
2021-04-10 03:53:26,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't know about any of that. 

I intend to own the company, so my goal is just amassing shares; ever since I posted my ""I am Going to Buy GameStop. All of It."" rant.

Since I'm judging my personal level of success by only the metric of share count, I get to enjoy more success every week, month, and year that this stock stagnates or trends downward.

Sucks when the price goes up though. Or when Robinhood stopped me from buying more shares. 

That stuff really slows me down."
2021-04-09 20:50:14,wallstreetbets,What else? Tendies.
2021-04-09 22:29:11,wallstreetbets,For to own Gamestop my friend
2021-04-09 22:13:46,wallstreetbets,"I mean, if he actually does get to own gamestop and the squeeze hasn't squozen... He can name his price and prop up the price to whatever he desires. Far fetched but it would be funny"
2021-04-10 04:27:33,wallstreetbets,"No, I don't think I will.

Gonna buy more, in fact."
2021-04-10 04:17:35,wallstreetbets,"Eh, 3.5Million shares would be a blip on the radar that we wouldn't even notice price-wise.

Even of the 70 million OG shares, that'd be a 5% dilution, but we see fluxes greater than 5% hourly lol.

Any major price adjustment from 5% dilution will probably be considered part of a FUD campaign.

Personally, I'm not stressing it. 5% weekly increase is ultimate goal, so a 5% dilution will ultimately slow me down literally by one week. 

I'm currently way ahead of schedule for owning this company on my personal timeline."

2021-04-10 11:40:38,wallstreetbets,"You should follow your analysis and short the stock to $50.  


This is not financial advice."
2021-04-10 10:26:42,wallstreetbets,"You've said so many bullish indicators I can't even... This is so exciting.

1) You seem to beleive its worth at *least* $50 (assuming you're pessimistically referring to a grossly rounded-down figure of $150 as ""3x its real value""), which is 250% of the ""fair"" value that the naysayers were claiming before the first pop-off was illegally halted.

2) Sounds like you think that the system is totally corrupt, which can only logically mean no one's money is safe there and retail should just pull 100% of their money out. Impending market crash (only a matter of time before your frustrated perception turns to action... What with folks getting vaccinated / live events scheduling again / people going back to work, seems like a good opportunity to secure money in the bank for normies like yourself), and with GME at a consistent negative beta that means a skyrocket for GME while the rest of the market tanks.

 3) Your math or understanding of options are utterly pitiful. If GME's ""fair value"" is worth a minimum of $50/share, which you yourself seem to believe is the case, DFV's $12 calls will be worth $5000 each. Unless you mean 500,000 pennies... Which is technically accurate I suppose. Well played on this one!

TL;DR - Thanks for verifying that the stock is explosively valuable, and extra thanks for clarifying how easily bears / naysayers can have their pessimistic ""fair value"" rapidly increased. Please keep spreading FUD. The cheaper the shares go, the more I can afford to buy. 😁"
2021-04-10 04:22:49,wallstreetbets,"This is totally non-emotional for me.

This is a calculated play to own a company I feel will do exceedingly well in the years to come.

Every week they well send you there gaminformer magazine but each will have a secret code at the end, if you collect all 4 mahwzines for the month, combine the codes and decippher them kt will say ""you're a fucking retard for reading all this I'm drunk asf shit posting from the toilet"""

2021-04-10 09:57:29,wallstreetbets,"Has OP confirmed this? I was under the impression that OP mainly increased his position by writing options (both puts and calls?), then reinvesting the collected premiums into GameStop.

On a previous post, he mentioned he had asked his lawyer If what he was doing was legal because it felt like a cheat code or something along those lines. And I’d imagine writing options for GameStop would feel like a free money cheat code considering the IV it has had.

If any calls he wrote went ITM and were exercised, I’d imagine he would’ve reinvested during a dip.

I was thinking the shares would eventually show up in his Fidelity account as a sudden addition of some 1,000+ shares when the contracts he’s written expire and he finally moves his shit out of RobinHood."

2021-04-10 02:35:33,wallstreetbets,News article being posted numerous times today in Reddit.  Everyone saying Melvin lied about closing out their positions if they lost 7 percent more in March due to GME as is stated in the article.  But where it gets funny is if they actually told the truth.  And then we’re stupid enough to try to short GME again!   However it happened article clearly states they lost another 7% in March from GME and for first 3 months of the year they down 49%.  Now all the jokes going around about it are saying something along the lines of “51 percent to go!”

Also you need an options for Dummies book because calls are literally worthless if not exercised and after next Friday his calls cannot be exercised. Sure they’re worth millions now (were worth many more millions a few days ago) but they will drastically decrease in value as the strike date approaches and then he’ll be forced to either sell the options or buy the stock."

Even bears aren't stupid enough to pass up that much free money."
2021-04-10 11:20:09,wallstreetbets,That is the way to make the minimum. The smart money is to sell the option (again hopefully done already for his sake) because this shit is a sinking ship and there are people out there who are willing to buy it as if stock will trade over $250 whereas exercising the option gets you $150/share and falling.
2021-04-10 11:14:26,wallstreetbets,"I’m not holding because I’m not an idiotic bag holder.

2021-04-10 16:19:45,wallstreetbets,"""I'm too poor to short the stock""

Followed by

""$12 calls next Friday will be worth pennies on the dollar!""

Followed by

""I made *five thousand* dollars off this stock""

Whether you realize it or not, you are literally doing technical analysis and making confident claims about the movement of the stock! Albeit shitty TA and also you're wrong... But let me help you learn about making trades based on a firm belief you hold (spoiler alert: this is how people make money in the stock market). 

""Pennies on the dollar"" for $12Calls expiring 4/16 means you believe the stock will be worth less than $13 by expiration.  

$115P expiring 4/16 cost $2.50/share ($250 cash) at most, as of market close before this weekend. With your $5,000 in winnings you could load up on TWENTY of those bad boys and earn a minimum $100/share when it falls below $15/share (that's $10,000 ***per contract*** you clever Michael Burry Jr., you!).

Times twenty contracts and you could turn your amazing $5,000 (congrats, by the way) into $200,000 *minimum*

Don't tell us you *know* what the stock is gonna do and in the same breath claim you can't afford to place bets on GameStop losing value. 

You are so full of FOMO, fear, and uncertainty all you can bring yourself to do is sit around moaning about Sour Grapes."
2021-04-10 12:45:30,wallstreetbets,Oh yea? Then what the fuck you posting here for then? Go and enjoy your tendies man! Live life! (AKA fuck off and leave this subreddit)
2021-04-10 11:30:50,wallstreetbets,"Ahh, so you're super convinced you know exactly where this is going... But not *SO* convinced you're prepared to earn way more money than you already have?

Sounds like you're not all that sure, after all.

Maybe you're feeling FOMO and don't know how to express it properly?

It's okay to feel upset over missing out on shares/calls when it goes up, and it's natural to kick yourself over not buying puts before it drops. But those feelings are yours to deal with. 

Shoveling your emotional baggage onto long shareholders, without showing us what you stand to gain from it dropping, is just manipulation for the sake of manipulation.

There's a reason for the ""positions or ban"" rule, my friend. Put your money where your mouth is or sit quietly by the sidelines. Don't waste our time with your ""don't say I didn't warn you!"" M. Burry LARPing fantasy."

I’m not saying the stock will trade at < $12. But if it’s value is rooted in this thing hitting 400 again and it dropped from 200 > 100 by the time the calls expire they lost 75% of their value, pretty significant no? Just because they expire ITM doesn’t mean losing 7 million dollars in unrealized gains easier to swallow.  
Also I never said I was poor, but the capital required for naked shorts is absurd right now, and I don’t have a million dollars liquid chilling in a brokerage account now."
2021-04-10 11:37:00,wallstreetbets,"I don’t have a fear of missing out on anything, I can’t short because I don’t want to buy the stock to hold the short and and I don’t have the capital to do it naked.  
I will not financially gain when it drops but I can finally stop being inundated with these shit posts memeing Joe Schmo into holding 3 shares so dickheads like you can make thousands on a 20 point jump. No one with 6 figures+ into this is a long hauler, they want the price to spike so they can make their quick buck then GTFO leaving all the people without 2 pennies to rub together losing money they don’t have because they bought into your lie.

2021-04-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Moderna (MRNA) is the Tesla of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology world. Moderna to reach $600 by 2023. **MY POSITIONS:** I believe in this company long term and think there's a great short term opportunity to buy it below recent price targets. The stock is trading well below its worth because of recent market turmoil and investors not yet grasping Moderna's endpoint. I have a history of buying call options on Moderna when it went on sale. I have over 1,000 shares of Moderna and also have $30k in call options for 4/30.

https://preview.redd.it/26ajcc31n8s61.png?width=1798&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9f28948ce2f58bb5875bad3ec923a057678a11f

**BACKGROUND:**  I'm a scientist and I work at NYU and the CDC. Back in February 19 2020 before there was a single documented case of COVID in NYC my colleague (Dr. Mark Mulligan) hosted a seminar titled ""2019 Novel Coronavirus - A Pandemic Threat"" -- WHO was still hesitant to call COVID a PHEIC and the CDC was currently making recommendations against wearing masks. Mark shared that Moderna was a promising company and poised to deliver a vaccine for COVID sooner than anyone else and faster than anyone else had ever done in the history of the vaccine world. Mark went on to lead the clinical trials for Pfizer. A little over a year later and I'm fully vaccinated with Moderna.

On May 22, 2013 Tesla announced that it paid of its DoE loan 9 years early. It was roughly $19.42, it's now worth 34x as much. Moderna didn't get a DoE loan but they got grant funding and revenue well ahead of their financial plan. They're in a phenomenal position to do three things:

1. Increase production for their current operations
2. Fund additional research in flu vaccines and cancer
3. Pay back debt much earlier than initially projected just like Tesla did

A few times in a decade an innovation comes along that makes a great leap forward. Moderna is one of those leaps forward. In 2012 Alex Krizhevsky started the artificial intelligence boom known as deep learning as he advanced an old idea that NYU professor Yann LeCun pioneered in the 90s, the major difference was timing -- both GPUs and data matured in a way where neural networks could flourish. Less than one year later Rob Fergus at NYU reproduced this work, demonstrating one of the most important conditions for growth -- reproducibility. For the vast majority of biotech companies in clinical trials, you're rolling a dice and crossing your fingers. Moderna's approach works, just like neural networks worked -- they will reproduce and mature their technology and apply it to numerous serious diseases and will soon have an expansive portfolio beyond COVID vaccines. Moderna (MRNA) and BioNTech have shown the technology behind MRNA is reproducible and primed to flourish -- MRNA is on a similar trajectory as deep learning. MRNA isn't a new idea nor were neural networks or electric cars, timing is everything.

Moderna makes highly effective vaccines for COVID and Flu (soon) that can be developed in a fraction of the time. That's not even the most exciting thing about this company. Moderna and BioNTech may truly treat cancer and not in the way that clickbait articles promise -- but in the way that we used to see HIV as a life threatening disease and now we see it as a treatable and manageable condition. Moderna will benefit from its highly optimized and nimble operations, it's running at a pace that other companies will struggle to catch up with. While BioNTech has talented scientists they needed Pfizer to hold their hands, Moderna (MRNA) has proven far more self-sufficient in navigating the world of business. AZN, NVAX, J&J -> have proven to be poorer choices. They're slower to deliver, they overpromised and underdelivered (J&J), they're less efficacious and more dangerous (AZN). Meanwhile Moderna is scaling up operations to deliver more than projected.

**Near term catalysts:** 4/14: vaccine day, 4/28: annual shareholder meeting

**Long term catalysts:** Curing some types of cancer \~2023

**Longer term catalysts:** Making highly tailored personalized medicine to treat once life-threatening diseases \~2040

**TLDR: Moderna is a game changer** with room to grow. It's REAL value and not a meme roller coaster that ends right back where it started. Moderna is the next Tesla, hop on and **ride it to the moon.**"

2021-04-10 12:40:21,wallstreetbets,"If OP is indeed a scientist at NYU I’d at least expect proper spelling e.g. of mRNA (not all caps MRNA which is modernas ticker symbol) or Biontech (not BioEnTech). So that’s weird.

However, I actually agree with the sentiment. I’m a life scientist (check my post history...) and most of what OP writes checks out. However I find the short term outlook for MRNA too optimistic (though I’m long MRNA myself, see below).

For context. There are three relevant mRNA technology companies in the world: Moderna (USA), Biontech & CureVac (both Germany). Of the three, I’d argue that MRNA is in the “weakest” position. Biontechs CSO is the woman who actually “invented” the mRNA vaccination and therapy idea as an academic in the 90ies. She’s likely to get the Nobel Prize for it this year. CureVac has the most experience in the field, their vaccine will very likely soon be approved (more opportunities for short term plays there!). Also look up CureVacs technology on vaccine printing which they developed wi rn, you guessed it, none other than TSLA. Both Biontech & CureVac have partnered with big companies for vax production - so they’re out producing (& outselling) MRNA at least until 2022.

That said, I like all three stocks, am long 40-50 shares in each (not much play money for the market here...)."

When has government ever had your best interest and actually cared for the individual? Never. So I find it crazy that millions are jumping on board getting vaccinated because the government said its good! It’s so illogical. And then they’ll defend their position because scientists said its safe. Okay, but what about the tens of thousands of scientists who say its not? They’re instantly banned on all platforms so the public will never hear what they have to say. The instant deplatforming of any doctor who speaks against the vaccines is enough proof for me to wait a year or two"

They had it like less than two weeks into the first reported outbreaks and discoveries of covid.

All the other wild outbreaks like MERS and SARS helped scientists know exactly where to start and how to handle developing a vaccine.  None of this was on a blank slate, and the immense funding and necessity to focus and dedicate time to developing a vaccine allowed them to do it so quickly.

DNA => RNA => protein.

Notice the arrows are one way. It doesn't go back in.  Chill.

In the case of Moderna and Pfizer you are receiving RNA that your body can use to make inactive pieces of COVID. Antibodies recognize it as if you are infected, but you're not. Your body remembers this, and when it sees the real virus down the road it kicks its butt.

This is revolutionary technology.

There are some RNA viruses that use reverse transcription to intergrate into your genome (e.g. HIV) but that's not happening here.

I nor my wife take shots and my kids don’t either. My son has a heart defect now after he got 1st MMR shot. I delved into it thinking there’s more to this than Mercury or Thimerosol. I was right.

also, though from Pfizer:

2021-04-10 04:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I bought Intel back at the start of February and again when it dipped in March, didn't see the old post or this one, but based on my thoughts.

As a tech guy, I own an AMD cpu and an Nvidia gpu, I have been sceptical of Intel for years. They have probably spent the last 10 years being a monopoly bully and not actually inovated at all.

As far as I am concerned, semiconductors will continue to grow, I don't see that slowing down, but the types of architectures that we use will shift. I think there will be a slow decline of x86, apple have proven that it's outdated.

The hiring of Pat Gelsinger has changed my outlook completely. Previous Intel was only really interested in milking the cash cow and had no expertise in development. As far as I am concerned, Intel should be back to front technology solution, using their expertise in computer engineering to produce solutions in which ever computer architecture or product size the market requires, delivering solutions from silicon to drivers.

Right now, AMD and TSMC are at the top of their game, and their valuation reflects this. I still think they are good companies, but it's very obvious, AMD p/e is around 75 and TSMC is about 36. Intel is about 12, but I bought in at 10. 

The next year or 2, they will sell silicon regardless if it's actually any good, people will still need work laptops and roll out small buisness server deployments, and it's not always about the very best, but what you can get for the price. They still have incredible sales channels for big clients too, and AMD splitting it's silicon priority 3 ways between GPU, desktop cpu and Server cpu means they just won't have enough capacity to satisfy demand. The launch of Intel GPU's could be a great move too, however short term I don't expect them to be fantastic until they split their architecture between productivity and gaming.

I remember looking back at AMD, and the hiring of Lisa Su. She joined at $3-4 per share and now they are $80, but the huge shareprice growth wasn't really seen until about 3 years after her joining.

If Pat Gelsinger is the man to turn Intel around, he has to change it's culture and objectives. They have the talent, they have the resources, they have the clients, they have the branding. They have literally had everything to be successful available too them over the last 10 years, and have been heading the wrong direction.

I see Intel as a long term buy & hold. They will be back, but what do I know, I'm not a financial advisor, I just throw my video game money a stock account and hold until it's up."
2021-04-09 21:18:03,wallstreetbets,"Intel is investing 20 billion in AZ plant coming up in 2023 with an unknown node. TSMC is investing 100 billions in their leading edge node. They already have 5nm out in mass production, look at your latest iPhones. TSMC wins. Intel's IceLake is behind AMD's Epyc Milan. Intel needs TSMC 7nm to make GPUs. AMD probably bought all the 7nm capacity for Epyc/Ryzen/Radeon/APUs/consoles so good luck. Not to mention Intel have to compete with Nvidia for 7nm capacity also because Nvidia makes their server GPUs on TSMC 7nm."
2021-04-09 20:45:46,wallstreetbets,"Intel is a company I have been looking at very closely and honestly... they COULD be extremely undervalued based on their aspirations.  I can’t help but feel that when they announced the new 20B in capital spend on a new AZ fab, the market missed the other announcement which was a much bigger deal - the fact that they are now actively seeking to manufacture chips for other chip designers."
2021-04-10 00:57:53,wallstreetbets,"They weren’t invited, because they’re fabless companies."

2021-04-10 09:57:41,wallstreetbets,"That’s because unlike Intel, AMD, NVidia and Apple are not struggling as much in terms of material procurement. The new facilities planned and recently announced by Intel are still merely promises, although aimed at improving the supply chains. Intel is also far behind AMD on the tech side of thing, which could take years to catch up. In my opinion AMD, and even Nvidia and Apple are much better buys. At this point Intel’s brand name is popular by inertia, and not due to the value it provides. 2021-2022 the spotlight will be reserved for AMD"
2021-04-09 21:25:22,wallstreetbets,"Intel isn’t going around anytime soon, but AMD has the competitive edge on them by a long shot. Intel could start feeling how AMD was feeling 10 years ago"

2021-04-10 15:01:29,wallstreetbets,"X86-x64 was an architecture that should never have existed. Intel forced it down the industries throats back on the day and bullied competition. This forced the entire world to believe that x86-x64 was good, meanwhile ARM chips can do the same thing with  basically no power consumption. 

Now, 30 years later, Intel can’t even make the best x64-x86 chip? They fucking invented them! Trash company forces CISC on the industry and can’t even make the best one?

Fuck Intel, dying breed. Also their GPUs will never be good. 

Fuck Intel, all my homies hate Intel"
2021-04-10 19:10:52,wallstreetbets,"Intel is not undervalued from my point of view, because of several reasons. There is only one single advantage right now for intel. In opposite to AMD, intel produces its own chips. As you may know, AMD orders their chips at TSMC.

While AMD got their 7 nm already running intel IS still strugeling with 10 nm processors. 7 nm won't happen in the closer future. Even their newest i-11000 are still 10 nm design ported to 14 nm. The design of intels CPUs is completly outdated. They already talked to TSCM to produce their 7 nm CPUs there because intel can't get this done within the next 5 years. They also think about to stop producing their CPUs on their own at all, because they dont have the know how to achieve new production lines as quick as TSMC. TSMC does nothing else then optimising their production and machines.

Also the new server CPUs are trash, period. They are 10 nm CPUs, AMDs Epyc are 7 nm and because of that way more efficient. And thats what matter in the server market, how many calculation power / Watt. The new 5nm Zen 4 will annihilate intel.

[https://www.networkworld.com/article/3607189/amd-builds-momentum-in-server-market.html](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3607189/amd-builds-momentum-in-server-market.html)

I wouldn't bet on that horse, if want an honest discussion."
2021-04-10 05:34:05,wallstreetbets,"As a counterargument, white house old farts have no idea about the sector and are just inviting big names because automotive chip shortage is just ccar companies halting chip orders during the pandemic, losing their position to order chips and now crying to make the WH step in and make foundries make chips for them again without waiting to first fullfill the orders of clients that didn't left them hanging.

Second, so far the Xe gpus are incredible subpar and more than 2-3 years behind competition. I doubt they will launch anything close to a 3080 any time soon seeing as :1) they have zero experience in high power GPU and 2) They have a non competitive fabrication node for the size a GPU die requires

And Third, intel has sid they are investing 20 billions in three years in a new fab, but that will not help at all. TSMC is investing 100b in a shorter timeframe. Add to that that intc hasn't even make new machines purchases for that new fab and you quickly arrive to he conclusion that it's a gimmick move to get some gob. money handout to keep buying back stock. 

Disclose: I'm super long AMD and will probably enter some INTC puts prior to their ER."
2021-04-10 05:40:01,wallstreetbets,"""Intel making massive investments in American manufacturing plant in  Arizona, putting them at a competitive edge over AMD and NVIDIA and  Apple which all buys their chips from 3rd party suppliers. $20B in  investments in Arizona plants""

Isnt this basically the reason why Intel has been biting the dust recently? From my understanding trying to manufacture the chips themselves is why they have been unable to reach 7nm.

Also fu intel they have been screwing over their customers for years with pricing / core count. Team red all the way"
2021-04-10 07:00:02,wallstreetbets,"13% a month ?

That's a tendy for a boomer ......"
2021-04-10 14:04:56,wallstreetbets,INTC won't be putting out competitive chips for at least 3-5 years.  Their new GPU is definitely not their savior and their 20B in investments is nothing compared to the 100B+ their competitors are investing.  This is a value play based purely on the chip shortage.  And anyone claiming Intel is maintaining its performance dominance in datacenter/server space is especially clueless.  Intel has A LOT of catching up to do those calls are gonna need a big full stock market melt up to print.

2021-04-10 03:53:46,wallstreetbets,They need to get rid of their marketing department. Their new ads are so cringe.
2021-04-09 20:27:29,wallstreetbets,"Apple currently has 5% of the laptop+desktop market and they are the only ARM competitor.
Is their M1 chip good? Yes. Especially good considering it's their first iteration. Doesn't mean the industry overnight changes to ARM. Nobody makes good risc server processors. ARM released a new architecture for their cores targeted at servers this week and that is still in development. So some time before ARM can compete.
Mobile ARM is killing it. But neither Intel nor AMD compete there."
2021-04-10 03:52:07,wallstreetbets,"Competitor is a strong word seeing as they have zero marketshare in the GPU market right now, I personally would have to see how quick they would be for new games driver support for a few years before even considering buying one. Nothing beats NVIDIA driver support, AMD is gaining and getting better all the time, but I still havent been sold on AMD gpu yet.

It's the main flaw I see in intel, they are unable to say ""our 10nm node is terrible and everything over 100mm2 has yields under 10% "" Had they said that back in 2016, on time for LG to decide for a node change, they would probably be still manufacturing for third parties with great success.

They have the tech, but they lack the customer relationships that samsung or TSMC have."
2021-04-10 07:19:53,wallstreetbets,"We didn't say the industry changes over night, that's the whole point I'm making. OP made it sound like a few changes and in the next few weeks Intel will be leading the market which simply isn't true.

Intel is lagging behind in the enthusiast scene, but they dominate the mobile/laptop scene, however they haven't announced anything to combat ARM, which is an upcoming threat as the M1 chips have shown, we've no idea if the Qualcomm laptop chips will be as good, but we do know the current ARM architecture is superior when it comes to the current market Intel dominates.

The only thing the OP got right was the server dominance, but it's not even about just hardware otherwise AMD would have a larger share than it does now, but about their legendary support and swiftness, it will take a lot to make a business move away from Intel."
2021-04-10 07:12:49,wallstreetbets,"I know.  Just being polite. It's a silly statement that Intel GPU's will suddenly be great. There's a dozen factors to it, otherwise AMD would have a decent chunk of the market share opposed to Nvidia having like 90% of the market"
2021-04-10 04:18:35,wallstreetbets,How intel sizes and packs their chips is exactly why they won't win unless they adopt TSMC methods or come up with a new way. Intel took 10 years to develop their 10 nm technology and how they currently pack their chips isn't going to work past 7 nm. In content creation an older AMD 3900x will still mop the floor with a brand new 10900k just because their chiplets design and packing grants them more cores and threads to get the work done. Intel has a long road ahead and wishful thinking won't get it done.

2021-04-09 20:16:11,wallstreetbets,"Intel does have much more broad diversification of a product line-up that can use still benefit from having capacity available from older process nodes that are no longer competitive for CPU production.  That does help define some benefit to in-house capacity.

In contrast, with AMD and NVIDIA primarily focused on the CPU/GPUs, there is much less use for older process nodes.  The heavy investment required for running the Fabs and keeping them current would weigh them down a bit from a cost control perspective.

On the consumer side... if we are lucky, the leadership change at Intel will spark their innovation engine again the industry as a whole will benefit from better products and competition on the performance-front."

2021-04-10 13:12:05,wallstreetbets,Nice! Best of luck!  😁
2021-04-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Pain.. This is small compared to other posts on here. But it was a lot for me. (I'm too worried about transferring out of shithood until everything is over) 
2021-04-09 22:03:28,wallstreetbets,I see your FB put. I've been considering taking that bet but the more users they run off the higher the stock goes. Wtf?
2021-04-09 20:00:13,wallstreetbets,Get those calls on AAPL while the getting's good!

2021-04-10 00:07:46,wallstreetbets,that's not small at all.  its alot of money to me and i am so sorry for your loss. i know you will never make this mistake again.
2021-04-10 08:47:22,wallstreetbets,Either you roll or avg down your calls unless you stupidly bought calls that expire that week but why would you possibly do this since those stocks got murdered
2021-04-10 03:01:58,wallstreetbets,People have been shouting from the rooftops that AMC is a dumpster fire to be avoided at all cost and then you bought a call?
2021-04-09 22:08:48,wallstreetbets,"It makes no sense man. They had tons of bad news, so I figured maybe I'll get a couple puts. Then they hit a 52 week high, I just don't get it."

2021-04-09 22:28:19,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, this is what I learned lol"
2021-04-09 23:05:36,wallstreetbets,I feel for you too then lol
2021-04-10 00:19:27,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, it was a lot to me too, but I took the risk. I will definitely never make that mistake again haha"
2021-04-10 11:40:49,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I bought them a few weeks ago. I just kept hoping for one big day to maybe break even. And it just never happened. I averaged down from an average cost of 3k to 1.3k. But it never even got close to me being able to get even half back."
2021-04-09 22:01:27,wallstreetbets,This is WSB. Fuck shares. Options are always the play
2021-04-10 11:37:50,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, those were cheap lol I figured since it generally follows gme, if gme broke out again that so would amc and I could take a small profit."
2021-04-09 20:01:34,wallstreetbets,"If you knew what options were, you'd know it doesn't have to go to $300 to make mad profit.  But you probably don't.  Peace bitch"
2021-04-09 22:05:44,wallstreetbets,"I was losing a lot of money on options until I started doing the following:

Buy on red days, sell on green days. A gain of 100% is auto sell and profit tendies are placed into stocks. I buy options with at least 4 weeks to expire, and sell when they hit 2 weeks to either roll out or take profits. I also do not buy options in the morning, mostly lunchtime or closer to close.

Remember, timing is key. The market will still be here later.

The only options I buy with less than 4 weeks to expire are puts on UVXY and calls on SPY.

I hope you make many tendies.

Edit: Unsolicited advice, but I hope it helps :)"
2021-04-10 00:02:42,wallstreetbets,"Same way with Twatter. They keep going up too. It's almost like they are cooking the books or something. Probably rigged just like the election. Sooner or later that shit will catch up with them. There is no way in hell that Fakebook and Twatter have not lost tons of revenue. Same thing with Amazon, Google, and Apple."
2021-04-09 20:39:00,wallstreetbets,I'd say this coming week might be a good opportunity before the earnings dip.
2021-04-10 06:46:35,wallstreetbets,I would play the earnings run up on AAPL just dump before lol. I have 6/18 and 7/16 calls currently
2021-04-09 23:33:58,wallstreetbets,As soon as I bought my AMC calls they tanked
2021-04-10 16:39:46,wallstreetbets,">  I just kept hoping for one big day to maybe break even. And it just never happened.

thats how a lot of losses happen you gotta either sell your losers quick or roll them much further away. Yes it sucks that you have to wait longer but thats how you minimize losses."
2021-04-09 22:55:09,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-04-10 14:58:37,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, I came to say the same thing. Who actually holds until it hits their strike price?! Haha I would've started making money at like $230 on Monday"

2021-04-10 16:45:47,wallstreetbets,"Good advice.
Buying on red and selling on green days really makes a big difference and stops you FOMO in too late."
2021-04-10 06:00:44,wallstreetbets,Your advice goes against the conventional WSB wisdom which says NEVER SELL
2021-04-09 21:09:44,wallstreetbets,Get in and get out prior to earnings?
2021-04-09 23:41:45,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-04-09 22:14:07,wallstreetbets,"No problem, good luck! Also, at the money or slightly in the money is a little better for this strategy than out of the money."
2021-04-10 10:30:28,wallstreetbets,Why would you never sell an option???
2021-04-10 12:48:47,wallstreetbets,You have shown you have no idea what anyone is talking about
2021-04-09 20:02:39,wallstreetbets,"this advice will help me, apple is so bullish, its basically printing money. earnings are soon so i guess that’ll be the drop"

2021-04-09 22:23:35,wallstreetbets,Thanks again!

2021-04-09 20:04:31,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I would say to absolutely sell before the 28th haha I'm thinking of getting a couple apple calls on Monday, but if I do, you should get puts, because the universe hates me."
2021-04-10 13:31:31,wallstreetbets,"No, I am saying you don't hold options and never sell."
2021-04-10 00:08:15,wallstreetbets,This dude on youtube “inthemoney” was litteraly talking about losing a bunch of his money when buying around earnings
2021-04-10 00:20:20,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I read some posts saying it too, but I figured gme wasn't the norm. I was wrong."

2021-04-10 00:15:46,wallstreetbets,It's not about winning or losing but in the ulcers you made along the way.
2021-04-09 20:39:19,wallstreetbets,My etrade account bars look the same way. Hands down that platform is the best for options trading.
2021-04-09 23:49:48,wallstreetbets,"Not sure how you lost money on TQQQ, it'sback at its high"
2021-04-09 23:57:39,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I did the same with $15k in ARKK and was slaughtered. Should've just reinvested in GME at $50."
2021-04-10 02:00:17,wallstreetbets,"Should've put 6k into an ira,"

2021-04-10 02:15:09,wallstreetbets,Most amusing part to me is how hard it is to lose money betting on tesla at almost any other time in it's past. Then a few days ago see an unusual options pop up of someone putting 20 million down on puts.

2021-04-10 04:00:59,wallstreetbets,This is weirdly impressive. How did you amass so many bad plays?

2021-04-10 02:06:05,wallstreetbets,What's that interface? I have ETrade but haven't seen this.

2021-04-10 05:10:52,wallstreetbets,You must’ve really bought at the top on Tesla eh? It dropped to like 598 for a minute. I was kicking myself for not buying more. Within a week it was back up like 40 points. My last buy was a single share at 665 but when your cost basis is 440 pre split...the single share up high doesn’t hurt so bad :)
2021-04-10 15:53:11,wallstreetbets,Roku made you broku.
2021-04-10 17:11:40,wallstreetbets,see what happends when you sell. we get more retarded
2021-04-10 02:55:37,wallstreetbets,That's why GME diversification is the only way I know
2021-04-10 03:16:49,wallstreetbets,That's your own fault for diversifying.
2021-04-10 01:27:06,wallstreetbets,stay with gme man
2021-04-10 01:38:30,wallstreetbets,"Why are people still in this stock, it's over hyped and speculated to death... I feel bad for all the new bro investors getting suckered into this."

2021-04-10 01:47:47,wallstreetbets,Squeeze hasn't squoze yet
2021-04-09 22:12:32,wallstreetbets,It’s like... why not just leave it in GME?
2021-04-10 02:55:39,wallstreetbets,"I don't mean this in a snarky way, honestly, wouldn't it have just been more fun to plan on keeping it in? You are truly part of something that will likely go down as a small but extremely telling and admirable piece of history?

This may be a crude example, but everyone loves a war hero (with exceptions of course), but who does that hero love? He's brothers and sisters who held it tf down and may have not escaped with a ""win"" , but truly left behind a legend in their name and a shift in the zeitgeist with their cause"
2021-04-09 21:05:51,wallstreetbets,"Lol serves you right, should've left it in ;P"
2021-04-09 21:15:01,wallstreetbets,What a fucking fail.

2021-04-10 00:31:15,wallstreetbets,Too Diversified I’d keep only 1 God daME stock and Add More Cash to another
2021-04-10 00:43:21,wallstreetbets,Thats what you get for selling GME

2021-04-10 05:36:00,wallstreetbets,Well... The lesson to be learned is to not diversify but punt it all in GME init
2021-04-10 05:36:39,wallstreetbets,"Feel ya, worst case I get 32% of my losses written of my taxes next year."
2021-04-10 05:57:43,wallstreetbets,Maybe invest more into GME? 🤔
2021-04-10 06:19:34,wallstreetbets,I took 10k profits from gme and bought some mining rigs. Glad to see this was the superior play.

2021-04-10 07:08:53,wallstreetbets,That’s what you get for being a paper handed bitch.
2021-04-10 08:24:14,wallstreetbets,You should know how to hold if you were in game your own fault all those stocks are up now or on upside
2021-04-09 23:04:58,wallstreetbets,Shocked you made money on GME when you are clearly a paper handed retard lol. This makes me feel so great! Well deserved!
2021-04-09 20:30:47,wallstreetbets,"Ah, thanks for showing us all the consequences of paperhanding."
2021-04-09 21:08:31,wallstreetbets,How? 😂
2021-04-09 21:22:47,wallstreetbets,Made good money on Roku the last month with a ~315 average. Did you trade options on it?
2021-04-09 21:28:46,wallstreetbets,Don’t lose money until you sell
2021-04-09 21:28:47,wallstreetbets,At least you aren't losing in PLTR that badly
2021-04-09 21:31:17,wallstreetbets,It’s only a loss if you sell.
2021-04-09 21:32:42,wallstreetbets,''this is *the way*
2021-04-09 21:40:57,wallstreetbets,"As long as you didn't invest in sndl , you still have hope"
2021-04-09 21:41:10,wallstreetbets,At least it’s a tax write off!
2021-04-09 21:44:57,wallstreetbets,Should have bought amc while you were at it 😜
2021-04-09 22:17:06,wallstreetbets,Shoulda spent 10k on night vision instead. Hours and hours of fun.
2021-04-09 22:23:24,wallstreetbets,Should have thrown some in AMC and you'd have another green crayon to enjoy
2021-04-09 22:37:14,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2021-04-09 22:38:05,wallstreetbets,We're you using options? You need to beta hedge bro.
2021-04-09 22:41:33,wallstreetbets,Experience is what you get when you wanted something else.
2021-04-09 22:53:10,wallstreetbets,It'll be back
2021-04-09 23:05:49,wallstreetbets,Please tell me you didn’t actually sell and realize the loss on these.

2021-04-09 23:43:19,wallstreetbets,I start my “fun money” at $200 and try to work my way up instead of the other way around. Less risk and i behave more carefully because there are less moves available for me in the beginning.
2021-04-09 23:45:35,wallstreetbets,Can't sell TSLA like that. Even when haters talking about it going down to 300 or whatever
2021-04-09 23:45:56,wallstreetbets,I refer to it as my FEB0205C125 opened 01-26 closed 01-27 life changing option.
2021-04-09 23:46:27,wallstreetbets,Jesus Christ you can really pick some winners. At least you bought Apple and Disney.

2021-04-10 00:33:19,wallstreetbets,"Well, you haven't lost anything until you sell. Sit tight, they always turn around"
2021-04-10 00:40:46,wallstreetbets,"I am tired for waiting the squeeze ? All is about buy and sell , and I feel like some apes , are taking advantage . They say trade and that it . So ?????"
2021-04-10 00:41:03,wallstreetbets,Tf are you doing
2021-04-10 00:42:13,wallstreetbets,"No squeeze for GME , it is over , right? Do not manipulate us. With your yolo and options. No balls no money to buy. You are just saying casino . Retards"

2021-04-10 10:37:37,wallstreetbets,It's almost like you were convinced these other meme stocks would run and shorters ended up taking you instead of that money going back into gme. Odd..
2021-04-10 10:50:19,wallstreetbets,Makes me rethink my TSLA strategy lol
2021-04-10 10:55:46,wallstreetbets,Epic
2021-04-10 11:01:28,wallstreetbets,I wish I could get this across to my friend that thinks because I got him into GME he’s some sort of stock savant now.
2021-04-10 11:27:01,wallstreetbets,"I feel ya. Lost 1.5k of ”fun” money this week, which is much for me. Some costly lessons learned and will hopefully continue onwards a bit more smoothebrained."

2021-04-10 12:52:47,wallstreetbets,That’s what you get for selling GME.... you should have held like the rest of us instead of making a measly 10k...
2021-04-10 12:54:35,wallstreetbets,Pltr will be back soon
2021-04-10 12:56:11,wallstreetbets,"Teach me your ways, sir."

It’s usually due to carelessness which got hugely out of hand. That’s exactly what Citadel is as a monopoly market maker. When they get destroyed I can assume that citadel will pay for their corruption through all stocks they have and liquidity. It’ll be a huge burst in the corruption bubble giving way to a new fairer market"
2021-04-10 08:58:04,wallstreetbets,Not a loss until you sell

Or baghold. These will rise"
2021-04-10 16:28:21,wallstreetbets,True. Much more fun when they go up.
2021-04-10 12:38:43,wallstreetbets,I never thought to try this. Is that before or after fomo?

2021-04-09 20:20:59,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-04-09 21:21:16,wallstreetbets,That’s because I’m holding all my PLTR losses in my main account.
2021-04-09 21:22:15,wallstreetbets,Most of these losses are from the March sell off. Lots of April calls bought in Feb and held way too long.
2021-04-09 22:28:35,wallstreetbets,Because all the stocks you own are stocks with heavy retailer holdings. And funds hate that
2021-04-10 06:50:51,wallstreetbets,Meme stocks.

2021-04-09 23:41:54,wallstreetbets,"Yes, because you end up with actual money in your hands."
2021-04-09 22:35:13,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, OP lost 4.4k of his 10k despite Tesla at worse dropping from 900 to 550.

There's probably options at play..."
2021-04-09 23:52:01,wallstreetbets,Buy high sell never while your calls crash and burn during a market dump 🚀 💥
2021-04-10 03:04:55,wallstreetbets,Must have bought in Jan or Feb
2021-04-09 23:58:22,wallstreetbets,By buying calls right before NASDAQ takes a huge dump and holding way too long because you’re a hopeless tech bull 🤷🏾‍♀️
2021-04-09 23:48:41,wallstreetbets,Shoulda coulda woulda 😑
2021-04-10 03:57:59,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the market is inflated, and we were all supposed to buy our favourite tech stocks up on our shiny new apps that get us the best execution for free in a free market because more democratised, Robin Hood, little John, or something or other 🍌"

But keep up those 💎🤲 bud."
2021-04-09 21:26:36,wallstreetbets,Yep. Bought Apr calls at the end of Feb and held them way too long during the March selloff 😔

2021-04-10 03:52:06,wallstreetbets,"Demo day will be mind blowing. Some analysts think pltr’s commercial growth is not fast enough to justify the current price level of 23, but what the analyst fails to predict is the exponential adoption rate of pltr’s Foundry software by every industry. Karp himself said that in the not so distant future, corporations will have to use pltr’s software in order to stay relevant and survive. There have been so many cases of pltr’s software saving companies hundreds of millions of dollars. The software is fully vertically integrated and unlocks so much potential value of a company. In this sense, Pltr is basically a ticking time bomb to explode to 40+ a share once investors realize this is almost a mandatory software for any major corporations. Pltr’s software is too complex for any competitor to imitate or compete against. Pltr has already become too important of a company for US and western world to fail. Karp takes immense pride that Pltr aid US to  have the best military and industrial software in the AI arms race. Now finally on demo day, Pltr is proving their deep value in commercial application of Foundry software from consumer retail to pharmaceuticals. Last demo mainly focused on Gotham and the fundamental structure of Foundary. For this upcoming demo, Karp will present how Pltr’s software compliments every single industry and companies in Fortune 500. It is not an exaggeration that all 500 of the Fortune 500 companies will be using Pltr software one way or another in the next decades. Karp sees this happening himself and the guy is not joking. Karp is very cautious about not drawing too much attention to the stock but it is no secret that Pltr’s true value is far greater than 23 a share. Kathie woods bought during all the dips at 12, 18, 25, 23, etc. So you get the point how Pltr is one of her deep value picks."

2021-04-10 02:26:44,wallstreetbets,"> I now have 0 debt. Peace of Mind is the greatest ROI on earth.

Preach! But I have to ask. How the fuck do you invest enough to make that much profit when you're in DEBT?!?

I had to pay off about $8000 worth of debt before I could save enough to invest. Which was only $250. HOW? Do you just ignore your debts and invest money that should be going to bills?"
2021-04-10 02:47:54,wallstreetbets,so is now not the best time to buy??
2021-04-10 04:34:56,wallstreetbets,FUBO? More like FUBAR.
2021-04-10 06:57:13,wallstreetbets,I‘m in since 40$ 🤮 but I will hold! Of course !
2021-04-10 09:28:08,wallstreetbets,Now you get to put money aside every month for property taxes and home owners insurance.
2021-04-10 11:59:15,wallstreetbets,"Im very happy for u man
Now fuck off"
2021-04-10 13:14:56,wallstreetbets,Where did you find out about fubo? Like the DD aspect and how you knew to jump on board? I actually am a fubo subscriber and plan to buy some of their stock but wanted to see what others were saying and find some price lows and highs first.
2021-04-10 17:22:33,wallstreetbets,You fucking asshole........ Congrats on the gains.
2021-04-09 20:00:39,wallstreetbets,FUBU is still around?
2021-04-09 22:31:53,wallstreetbets,Let me get this straight - you put a $100K bet on FUBO of all stocks and you have a second job???? There’s got to be more to this story. Nobody with a second job just throws $100K on very short term FUBO calls let alone having $100K to do so (ie why have a second job if you have $100K to throw away). If not paper trades this screams of insider info.
2021-04-09 22:14:13,wallstreetbets,"Congrats on your huge hairy balls move paying off, but why pay off your house when mortgage rates are so low and you can deduct mortgage interest on your taxes?  Much better off with the money in the market. If you have a 3% mortgage you could put that money in UWMC, for example, and make 5% on dividends alone so you’d be 2% ahead."
2021-04-09 23:18:02,wallstreetbets,This makes me happy
2021-04-10 16:06:06,wallstreetbets,Don’t pay off your house retard. It has a low interest rate. Continue to pay your mortgage from your gains and dump the rest in an index fund.
2021-04-09 20:01:24,wallstreetbets,How did you know to sell near 25?
2021-04-09 20:02:22,wallstreetbets,"Congrats!! I’m still in the hole with FUBO. Holding out for a bigger payday. Also, FUCK YOU!!"

~$155 per contract sold *profit* x 850 contracts = ~$130K yolo fuck this guy

I would be smiles all day if I bought **one** of these and made $150.

I think it will keep going up, so I might just have to do that. It was $52/share months ago, but they also have lawsuits they are fighting. So I likely won't.

How did Archegos lose $100billion on ViacomCBS/Discovery when those combined arent even worth that much.

What else did they own?

So far, only about $30billion has been accounted for. 

So collectively, it looks like the market is missing something like $130billion or so.

Where the f is that $130billion tied up right now?

Or was it Archegos that lost the $70billion or so, and they are cashing out their longs before pulling the trigger on the squeeze?

Pure speculation, but if they are making headlines with $3billion movements, I think we would hear about this other $70billion."

2021-04-09 22:29:25,wallstreetbets,"I understand your point, but even tho I cannot know if everyone did close their positions or not, if you check the volume in January the highest volume is not during that jump from 60/70 (and not 20) to 350+, that was quite average volume for the stock, the highest volume was before that. During the highest volume the price didn't go up that much. Plotkin said it himself during the congress that the high volume was not them covering but more like frenzy/fomo retail investors purchasing. Now, as I said, I can't be sure of what happened, but it's kinda strange, still the % of float owned seems to be quite high > 100% only by institutions and we're not counting the retail investors. Maybe someone did close some positions but I doubt all the HF did close all of their positions. I doubt, can't be sure ofc.

I suspect that they tried to cover, price started to go up, they found it impossible to cover and they kept shorting to keep the price as low as possible (during this time was the highest volume with all this action), in fact the interest fee for shorting went up to 90% (!!!), during this time there was retail investors frenzy buy action that helped moving up the price, they didn't manage to cover enough and then while retail investors were crazy-buying robinhood removed the buy button from their app. Basically I think they didn't expect at all the retail investors to FOMO so much and jump in the stock like that, and this screwed their plan to cover.

Also, Finra reported 226% SI late February, and 19 days to cover (!!!), just another glitch?"

Move along nothing to see here only 10% short... yeah ok, until enough places reposition to cash in on this. Then media will flip the scripts to those paying them more than the shorts are. Entire system is corrupt just like back in 08

Edit; since apparently I have to write a dissertation on my comments to please folks that read it. The Bloomberg institutional data is still one of the best sources of data we have even if most of it is from 13f filings back in December. To say that there is no way it is still over 100% is simply naive. The institutional ownership includes some of retail lumped in through index funds amongst other things, so when it is updated, yea I still expect it to be over 100%. 

It’s clear this is all being heavily manipulated so we take the trusted data that we do have, even if it is out of date, and use it as a benchmark for extrapolation. 

Perhaps I should have just said I like the stonk?"

The GME media has been expressly negative with the consistent narrative that you shouldn’t be buying it.

2021-04-10 09:31:27,wallstreetbets,"Yes because a hedge fund plant would constantly tell people they are fucking idiots (they are) rather than try to insidiously create doubt. A hedge fund plant would obviously just say “I have a Bloomberg” because that’s the best way to remain incognito 🥸 

Believe what you want. Unfortunately you keep choosing to believe people who don’t know anything about markets."
2021-04-10 17:47:46,wallstreetbets,"Sure. All ownership filings are extremely delayed. It doesn’t matter if you use Bloomberg or another source :) though Bloomberg does tend to be bit better. 13fs are filed 45 days after the end of the quarter. Therefore the only real holdings data we have is from 12/31/20 (filed around 2/16/21) which as you know is a lifetime ago in GME. 

Some mutual funds file monthly and ETFs update daily so that can end up double counting some of the sources. If you see a reference to “FINRA showing ownership over 200%” look closely because they’re double counting 12/31 and 3/31 filings). Bottom line is we know short interest was over 100% 12/31, thus we shouldn’t be surprised instl ownership was over 100%, but we have basically NO IDEA what it is since then.

[AXON](https://axon.com), the company that owns the patent to the taser stock price jumps up every time there is civil unrest in the country. In the graph I provided it shows a substantial increase during protests/riots

Red being the initial George Floyd riots, Blue being the week before the presidential election and yellow being the reaction to the January 6th storming of the capitol.

So The reaction of the public if Derek Chauvin is found Not-Guilty is going to be obviously more violent then the last protests over the summer because there was no justice for the death of George Floyd.

I assume that there will only be a price increase if Derek Chauvin is found innocent or convicted and given a very light sentence

Some analysts think pltr’s commercial growth is not fast enough to justify the current price level of 23, but what the analyst fails to predict is the exponential adoption rate of pltr’s Foundry software by every industry. Karp himself said that in the not so distant future, corporations will have to use pltr’s software in order to stay relevant and survive. There have been so many cases of pltr’s software saving companies hundreds of millions of dollars. The software is fully vertically integrated and unlocks so much potential value of a company. In this sense, Pltr is basically a ticking time bomb to explode to 40+ a share once investors realize this is almost a mandatory software for any major corporations.

2021-04-10 13:06:33,wallstreetbets,"Greetings AlmostExactly,

Long time reddit lurker not a long time poster... I look forward to your response and thoughts on this minor DD I did myself.

Awesome DD and I am on board with the PLTR demo hype as well with 7 4/23 25.5 calls that I hope are gonna print. I have been doing some independent research and I came across your DD as well as ZiptraderU videos where he is very bullish on the stock with a PT of $55 for PLTR. I am actually in the trading group and discord as well. I bring this up because I was watching one of his PLTR videos (Feb 5th) and he talks about the partnership with BP that was introduced. Coincidently enough Friday when I bought my PLTR calls I also bought 7 more of my beloved June 18th $26 strike BP calls and DCA down (at one point up 250% when oil was rallying a couple weeks ago). To my surprise, these companies are working together so I kind of have positively correlated options contracts in the near future for both of these companies. I don't know if you know but BP is expected earnings in late April and the rumor on wall street these numbers are going to be very excellent for BP and the stock (potentially due to PLTR addition). It also came out that BP sold some of its stake in PLTR and other assets to reduce their debt by almost $4B more than wall street expectations and this caused the stock to rally 4 days ago. I am wondering if you can do some DD and edit to this post (or the next one) any findings on BP in regards to their use of the PLTR technology and how this may affect both stock prices if BP reports positive results and better numbers due to their transition to PLTR analytics.

In my opinion oil is only at the start of a bullish uptrend in a Biden administration coming out a pandemic and into generally the most expensive gasoline/oil prices of the year the summer season; and I believe that a positive catalyst with BP could also be a massive drive towards PLTR client base in the oil industry and other sectors due to their notable name.

Also BP plans to be 100% clean energy by 2050 and is one of the first companies making this push with recent purchases in this industry and the Biden administration. PLTR is directly helping them with this task.

Please look into this senpai and if you deem it necessary to add to your DD I believe all of WSB should be able to greatly benefit from both these companies in tandem. PLTR could be showing BP solutions on the demo day and this would be an actual dream for me.

Best Regards,

2021-04-10 01:46:37,wallstreetbets,I dont worry about taxes. I just worry about how to make more money.
2021-04-10 01:49:10,wallstreetbets,By next week I plan to. Even 250-300K would be nice. But shoot for the moon! I plan to roll ITM calls up constantly. Sell ITM buy 10X OTM and repeat.
2021-04-10 02:06:29,wallstreetbets,I also think anyone who cant wait 2 days to sell is also Dumb. So 15% up on monday is my prediction.
2021-04-10 02:03:09,wallstreetbets,"29.90 

If you think it will move sideways then sit this one out. But what I see is lower lows and higher highs. Holding support and rejecting resistance levels. 

Breaking out of a D. triangle. Upwards to top of triangle. 

I see all those 24 CC expired ITM today. Meaning call sellers were trying to pin it and got fccd and peoples shares got excercised. 

I see lots of Technical Analysis that says this is priming for a break out. Likely Monday. Likely Gap and Go and never look back."
2021-04-10 02:04:46,wallstreetbets,I also think youd be stupid to sell covered calls 2 days before demo day. Like dumb AF. Meaning call prices skyrocket.
2021-04-10 05:58:44,wallstreetbets,"Options are easy when you can see the future based history, TA and DD. Its less stressful that way. I told people Thursday all these calls would print 100%. 90% of my 544 contracts are profitable. And will continue to be until Wednesday morning when people sell the news. Then possibly it continues running for another day before dumping but Ill be gone way before then."

2021-04-10 01:17:50,wallstreetbets,Yes everyone gets the same password and they are all from the same movie. They like memes and being funny more than restricting viewers.
2021-04-09 22:06:01,wallstreetbets,Anything until they aren't. Depends on your r/R ratio. I have 50 different option chains. Clearly I need to clean that up but yeah. If you're buying Far OTM buy 4/23 and out. If you're buying DeepITM it's safer but less reward. Like $20 calls sell for 4.05 I payed 2.50 for some of mine.

2021-04-10 08:11:15,wallstreetbets,"🌈 🐻s have been complaining that the market is going to collapse for years.  But, the market keeps going higher and higher.  Fact is, this is the most obvious bull market in history and there aren't going to be any outflows anytime soon.  The entire notion of an imminent market collapse is based on a mistaken belief that the market will go down solely because it went up.  The gravitational market theory, if you will.  But that theory is bullshit. 

Markets are going up for simple reasons that will not come unwound anytime soon.  First, a growing wealth gap where more capital keeps moving to wealthier people.  The wealth flowing in the gap has to go somewhere.  Two, chasing yield in an era where bonds are bubbled into historically very low yields.  There is no yield in bonds, hell, the world over bonds have negative yields.  Money that would usually go somewhere needs a home causing a chase in yields.  Third, easy economic policies contributing to asset inflation.  

Unwinding these circumstances is not likely in the short term.  Catastrophic unwinding would be catastrophic and governments aren't going to let that happen.  The obvious catalyst for unwinding would be popping the bond bubble, which is why governments across the world are aggressively buying bonds to support the bubble.  Tax policy supporting the wealth gap.  All this contributing to asset inflation.  

As a policy this bull market hasn't even begun to ""blow off top"" yet.   Bull market continues for foreseeable future (next 5 years)"

2021-04-10 03:52:27,wallstreetbets,"Demo day will be mind blowing. Some analysts think pltr’s commercial growth is not fast enough to justify the current price level of 23, but what the analyst fails to predict is the exponential adoption rate of pltr’s Foundry software by every industry. Karp himself said that in the not so distant future, corporations will have to use pltr’s software in order to stay relevant and survive. There have been so many cases of pltr’s software saving companies hundreds of millions of dollars. The software is fully vertically integrated and unlocks so much potential value of a company. In this sense, Pltr is basically a ticking time bomb to explode to 40+ a share once investors realize this is almost a mandatory software for any major corporations. Pltr’s software is too complex for any competitor to imitate or compete against. Pltr has already become too important of a company for US and western world to fail. Karp takes immense pride that Pltr aid US to  have the best military and industrial software in the AI arms race. Now finally on demo day, Pltr is proving their deep value in commercial application of Foundry software from consumer retail to pharmaceuticals. Last demo mainly focused on Gotham and the fundamental structure of Foundary. For this upcoming demo, Karp will present how Pltr’s software compliments every single industry and companies in Fortune 500. It is not an exaggeration that all 500 of the Fortune 500 companies will be using Pltr software one way or another in the next decades. Karp sees this happening himself and the guy is not joking. Karp is very cautious about not drawing too much attention to the stock but it is no secret that Pltr’s true value is far greater than 23 a share. Kathie woods bought during all the dips at 12, 18, 25, 23, etc. So you get the point how Pltr is one of her deep value picks."

2021-04-10 06:52:35,wallstreetbets,"He didn't make any money on it. His CFDs were all liquidated because he couldn't actually pay. Credit Suisse alone had double the losses of Hwang.

2021-04-10 00:26:46,wallstreetbets,Haha where? The underside of a portapotty?
2021-04-09 23:43:03,wallstreetbets,"Yeah if the fruits and veggies could last pretty much indefinitely (let’s say 5 years frozen, 10 years canned) then after a couple years we’d have this huge stock that would need minimal resupply. Demand would be so low prices would plummet. The agricultural industry would take a big hit and downsize operations significantly.

I think this is already a partial problem with grains (corn/rice/wheat), which do basically last forever. Hence why they have all of the subsidies, particularly for corn. To artificially maintain a higher production rate than what actual demand warrants. 

Idk I think at this point, a massive amount of food waste is basically a necessary part of the economy.

Seems like one of those things where the solution to the problem (high food prices) is pretty simple to fix (by “increasing supply” by actually eliminating waste), but the simple solution has downstream third, fourth, fifth order of effects that make it more complicated. 

I keep thinking about farmers destroying all their crops and pouring out barrels of milk when covid started. They couldn’t afford to sell at low prices, so rather than flood the market with supply, further lowering prices, they would rather get nothing."

2021-04-10 00:50:15,wallstreetbets,With rising rates its other way around. Institutions will unwind risk since they can get yield on bonds.

2021-04-10 08:41:01,wallstreetbets,"Rising rates?  Oh no, the yield on the 10 yr has gone up a whole half a percent!!  There's still no yield in bonds and the Fed is going to keep buying to support the bond bubble."
2021-04-10 01:19:43,wallstreetbets,But isn’t the reason the rates are rising is because bonds are selling off?
2021-04-10 01:56:02,wallstreetbets,"Why are rates rising?

Simple. Because nobody wants these junk."
2021-04-09 20:23:44,wallstreetbets,"Same mindset, I have been invested in CURLF, CRLBF, GTBIF, and HRVSF since 2019.

2021-04-10 15:22:32,wallstreetbets,Smart man
2021-04-10 07:58:32,wallstreetbets,"Cresco operates exclusively in the USA. Meanwhile, Tilray and others are mostly situated in Canada - While Safe Banking will give them a bump, it won’t transfer through to their bottom line as much as it will for Cresco.

Additionally, Cresco has killed the M&A game with FloraCal, and One Plant, and others - They are buying companies that understand cultivation with quality-at-scale, and it seems that they are working on building a robust distribution infrastructure for the coming federal legalization.

They are also DOMINATING the wholesale game in California, which is impressive considering the size and competitive-ness of that state - Which sets them up for continuing success if federal legalization follows through and allows interstate commerce."
2021-04-10 13:50:59,wallstreetbets,They have similar revenue to the other major MSOs with way less retail footprint. They're a giant in the making and best positioned to dominate after things loosen up at the federal level.
2021-04-09 20:01:06,wallstreetbets,Too many green days means red will come soon right? Its on the gay bear bible
2021-04-09 22:07:20,wallstreetbets,Interesting way to see it
2021-04-10 18:24:51,wallstreetbets,"I mean there's plenty of logic to it, and he doesn't even need them to go itm. All it takes is a sudden, albeit short, leg down and that spike alone will drive the value up. Its the same reason my 4/16 425c went from .07 to .14 from a one dollar jump. 

Monday likely will be another green day, but ill eat a goats ass for dinner if it doesn't dip at open. Shits too green for the big boys not to take some profits. We also have some less than stellar data from BLS on Tuesday that is going to spike yields higher. Could be priced in but thats always a risk with anything.

Spy will absolutely go on a face ripper the rest of this month but it'll have at least a single pullback because that's how the market works."
2021-04-10 02:14:00,wallstreetbets,"I mean its SPY. All markets have strange times, but its incredible growth for SPY in such a short time. It's got to come down, thems the rules. If it doesn't return 10%, what will be base all of our mediocre investments off of?"
2021-04-09 20:41:34,wallstreetbets,This is what it seems like to me lol.
2021-04-10 18:32:51,wallstreetbets,"I mean its up because FAANG is melting face right now. I agree, it is going to come down. That said, I don't think it'll be much more than 2 or 3% and very likely soon. I wouldn't be surprised to see 430 plus by end of April. 

Its no longer trading on fundamentals, purely technicals so all it takes is one single piece of bad news to derail it or at least throw it a hair off course. You are probably going to have a very, very good Tuesday."

2021-04-10 18:28:01,wallstreetbets,What less than stellar data from BLS?
2021-04-10 11:07:30,wallstreetbets,"It doesn’t have to come down. It could trade sideways and certain sectors of spy could outperform while others underperform, leaving puts worthless."
2021-04-10 08:07:01,wallstreetbets,Yea that should only get you back to last years level + an annual average.
2021-04-10 00:23:13,wallstreetbets,Hell yea bro

2021-04-09 22:36:28,wallstreetbets,OP just be prepared for SPY 420 before 4/20 (seriously) and don’t fuckinf sell like a pussy. After that SPY goes to 404. Mark this post.
2021-04-10 08:13:21,wallstreetbets,"Perfect buying opportunity.

I am not exactly sure why, other than they are probably in an accumulation phase where MMs/Whales are buying up shares.

CRLBF sell off days have generally been low volume, which is a good sign."
2021-04-10 19:15:38,wallstreetbets,"CPI, the partner to the PPI that shot the 10yr up and tanked qqq for a hot minute before it recovered. Itll be worse than expected, most likely send up some inflation signal flares and spy/qqq will have a modest dip followed by a solid recovery, if it mirrors Friday. Or nothing could happen and it continues to melt up. I'm hoping for a smol dip Monday to flip my puts into bank calls because banks fucking rip off inflation concerns."
2021-04-09 21:21:08,wallstreetbets,"SPY IS too high but if it opens above 11 Monday- 

Then you better hope that Tuesday is red. Because 2 days of 1% will essentially leave your strike even if it starts dipping. 

And if it dips 1%, apes will buy it cause “Buy the dip”.

The is a bear trap waiting to happen. Monday and Tuesday will completely decided your options fate"
2021-04-10 05:28:54,wallstreetbets,Marked it
2021-04-10 19:26:30,wallstreetbets,It’s all priced in already. Nothing is stopping this market until the fed signals it’s raising rates or the fucking GME conspiracy theory MOASS happens.
2021-04-09 21:49:51,wallstreetbets,"It’s dated June, tf are you talking about this is going to print 100%, we are due for a 10-20% correction, look at how stretched we are above the upper bolinger band on SPY (2 st Dev), now go back and look at what happens each time that happens, major corrections everywhere"
2021-04-09 22:34:31,wallstreetbets,"It is not about dates moron, it’s about seasonality, flows, and how fast and hard a move is made. We have come to fast too far, it will correct itself. I will play SPX 4140C on Monday. Then see how the rest of the week plays out. If we keep grinding up, I’m playing SPX 4240 by Friday. If we reach this point by Friday I’m balls deep in puts. You can remind me on that my guy"
2021-04-10 19:53:47,wallstreetbets,"You can only price in expectations, and account for error. Cpi was hardly priced in but you're right they could use that data to adjust their model expectation of ppi. That said, it could exceed past expectation and margin of error leading to a sell-off. Pricing in works well on what you know, and very poorly on what you don't."
2021-04-09 22:00:23,wallstreetbets,"I’m not trying to be mean but you’re a retard (not the good kind) if you think a 10-20% dip on SPY is expected before June. 

It’s dated June but SPY is not a stock company. It moves with the market- it IS the market. The correction occur when a significant jump is reached. But it will ALWAYS go up as the time of your chart goes up. 

As in, as time approaches infinite, SPY gains increase toward infinity. This is just a fundamental truth of the market. 

this is like zenos paradox, his 410p will be left behind if  only 2 days show good gains because every dip will only dip for the gains it already go- the support does not change."
2021-04-10 15:31:20,wallstreetbets,Retards think market goes up forever
2021-04-10 19:56:05,wallstreetbets,Everyone already knows inflation is already at 4-5%. If there’s a dip it’ll be fake and very short-lived. Where else are you going to get the returns the market is giving? Holding cash is losing value.
2021-04-09 22:05:30,wallstreetbets,"Lol wow thank you for your kindergarten level logic and explanation. 

Shows you’re a new retard.

These puts will prints post opex 4/16 when SPY hits 404, and thats not even a major correction. 

Go learn a thing or two before you speak."
2021-04-10 18:38:47,wallstreetbets,"I mean big picture yes, it does. Unless the market itself it completely done away with, it will always head up. It certainly goes down, but the general movement is up."
2021-04-09 22:18:42,wallstreetbets,"RemondME! 2 months “did SPY go down to 404?”

Some guy had this exact fight with me cause I told someone to sell his puts on April 1st. He thought “after 2% gain in a day, market will go down!!!”

I hope you have puts too if you are so sure"
2021-04-09 22:37:50,wallstreetbets,"It is not about dates moron, it’s about seasonality, flows, and how fast and hard a move is made. We have come to fast too far, it will correct itself.

You really have a basic level understand of this shit don’t you"
2021-04-10 09:45:43,wallstreetbets,"It’s not about seasonality, flows and how fast and hard a move is made. It’s about future cash flow discounted to present value of the spy components. Earnings are on the upswing, not downswing, which will compress multiples. If the market jumped this much and future cash flows were not going to increase, then yes a correction would be imminent. You are basing this off of pure technicals but ignoring the fundamentals. I think most people bought puts as a reaction to some trader buying 40mm vix calls but what they don’t take into account is that is probably a hedge to a massive bullish bet. The retards talking about how overvalued spy is are taking trailing 12 mo earnings (During a god damn lockdown) and assuming earnings are going to modestly grow during a reopening with consumers sitting on a hoard of cash while being trapped in their houses for the past year. I think it’s interesting how everyone conveniently ignores the fact that tech (23% of spy) has raised spy to these levels. If you see a rotation to other sectors, which is happening, tech could go down or flatline for months, and other sectors would increase as a percentage of spy and keep spy positive or flat. Buying puts on the entire market is insane when you could concentrate them in overvalued stocks if you really expected a decline."
2021-04-09 22:43:24,wallstreetbets,"I’m saying this dude will not make money if SPY grows both Monday and Tuesday. 

I’m being clear and giving actualy dates. Your entire analysis is “it went up so it must come down some time”.

Saying “your have basic level understanding” seem like a projection. If you feel good enough, then make a prediction where your mouth fits. You’re so sure- it shouldn’t be too hard."
2021-04-10 12:17:34,wallstreetbets,"Wrong. Look at what happened in March. Ever single sector was in the shitter. Inflation on the rise, bond yields will increase. US reopening is good for the economy. The stock market is not the economy. Cash flows will go from equities into actual consumer goods. Unemployment numbers decreasing will have to lead to interest rates increase no matter what the fed is harping.

Edit: also the latter half of your statement complete agrees with my thesis that SPY will decrease for a short amount of time. Where our interpretations differ is that I don’t think other sectors will have enough oomph to keep us flatlined or sustain current levels. Don’t get me wrong this is not at all a bad thing for markets, just that there will be some downside."
2021-04-09 22:44:44,wallstreetbets,"Yes he will, doesn’t matter if we 1% Monday or Tuesday. It’s dated JUNE. Do you get that my guy? 

We stair step-up and always elevator down. Just watch."
2021-04-10 12:40:00,wallstreetbets,"I’m not talking about the cash inflow into equities. I’m talking about the cash flows of businesses. You know, how every analyst ever values equities... and that is not true that every sector was in the shitter lol. Look at spy home builders. Look at materials. Look at industrials. Look at financials. Energy was relatively flat for the month. It was tech that dragged down spy and some other sectors because of etf redemption/creation. But that’s exactly how sector rotation works. Managers sell off the outperformers to move money into the underperformers and it drags the price down because the weighting of tech is so massive in the s&p. All that means is you can get better deals on the stocks you should be moving money into."
2021-04-09 23:23:42,wallstreetbets,Bet.
2021-04-09 23:11:42,wallstreetbets,I love you
2021-04-10 12:57:31,wallstreetbets,"That’s what I’m saying, the same rotation will occur and other sectors were not enough to keep SPY up and won’t be again"
2021-04-09 23:15:21,wallstreetbets,"OP don’t let me down, I wanna see those gains end of April 👌🏻"
2021-04-10 13:25:21,wallstreetbets,"As more money flows into other sectors, the weight of those sectors increase. Even in the tech sector Apple and msft both have reasonable valuations. It was people selling zm, docu, teladoc and all of the other insanely value stocks in qqq that dragged msft and Apple down. Those stocks haven’t recovered. People watch these etfs and indices and don’t pay any attention to the components. It’s money moving into different stocks within the same index or etf. If you want to buy puts on spy though good luck."

All these hedge funds have unlimited tools to bankrupt companies whenever the hell they want while doing the opposite is incredibly difficult in comparison.

2021-04-10 01:51:30,wallstreetbets,"Let say Melvin have $100

They lost 53% in Jan, meaning they left $47 on late Jan.


Whatever they did on Feb, they gain 22% (Probably it is 22% of remaining $47)

So $47 * 1.22 = $57.34

And on March, they slid 7% (of $57.34)

$57.34 * 0.93 = $53.3262 (Around $53.33)

So the Q1 started with $100 and ends with $53, a loss of 47%.


I believe this is what they are talking about"

He could just pull the bandaid off but he goes bankrupt right now as opposed to later. Instead it's just a coast until his fund is fully depleted and there's nothing left to cover the liability. He doesn't get margin called because the main players know it's a bomb on them as well. And if the repercussions are so bad that even the real power brokers would rather let him bleed out than margin call... What does that mean for the entire financial system?

I get the righteous anger, but if all of this is true, sometimes I feel like this is a bomb that shouldn't go off. It feels like a kamikaze, not feasting on a backfired trade. What happens to faith in the American financial system if a MOASS actually happened? Couldn't the effect be more far reaching than just this one trade?"

2021-04-09 23:53:22,wallstreetbets,"Having the company go bankrupt also means that they never have to return any shares, including ones that were naked shorted and should never have existed. So it makes them a ton of tax-free gains and covers up illegal shenanigans."
2021-04-10 03:08:53,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-10 03:06:14,wallstreetbets,It means you don't have to return the shares you borrowed at all so it makes your gains way larger. Not sure about tax free...that would seem too good to be true (for them).
2021-04-09 21:52:05,wallstreetbets,"Of course. Traditional valuations don’t support the current price, right? So I’m betting the rewards looked even greater in February than ever before.

Quite honestly, I think they might have been right had DFV went another way. But he didn’t."
2021-04-10 04:19:00,wallstreetbets,"Then you don’t understand how hedge funds or shorts work. “Shorting” is literally the opposite of buying long which for some weird reason people are obsessed with only going long - they only try to make money when the market goes up, but never down. I see them exactly as equals, I short when something is going down (or I believe so, which is a difference heh) and long when I think it;s going up.

Hedges have millions of both long and short positions, most of them hedged (hence the name) so that they are market neutral aka they dont care if the market in general goes up or down. 

Melvin had a ton of short positions in GME in January, which they had to cover at an insane loss (imagine shorting at 4 dollars and you have to pay maybe 300 later, that is 296 dollars loss in each GME position), hence the ridiculously brutal losses on January (52%). 

But, and here’s the thing, precisely what you said of “pulling the bandaid” is what a hedge would NOT do in this situation. Pulling the bandaid and purchasing a ton of shares to cover the shorts would increase the GME price dramatically, making the lossess even higher. They had to do it on January because who knows what the limit was, but, assuming they stll had some short positions on GME (doubtful because of risk), they would to it gradually cause then you don’t push prices higher and save billions of dollars.

I assume they did short GME when it hit 320 dollars and immediately went down to 280 or so (I did too), because it was free money, around 50 dollars from each stock in barely 2-3 hours. That’s an INSANE ROI. But besides from that, doubtful that Melvin would dabble much into GME after the January debacle unless it was a really obvious play."

2021-04-09 20:19:51,wallstreetbets,I'm so glad he made that video. It was what convinced me to buy GME.
2021-04-10 11:52:38,wallstreetbets,What even is the point of investing into companies if we have zero effect on their success?
2021-04-10 01:53:25,wallstreetbets,"Depends what strike price and expiration. A lot of puts were bought the day RH shut down purchasing. Im sure those did very well. Same as the day they flash crashed it when it got to 348. 

Who knows if they bought more when it was at $40 and in the low 100’s. I know there were a lot of puts they bought a long time ago for the date GME had to pay back their debt bonds."
2021-04-09 21:00:32,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha I just think it’s funny you’re trying so unbelievably hard and getting nowhere
2021-04-09 21:09:03,wallstreetbets,Also that was the first comment I’ve seen of yours lmao you think I’ve been watching your career of downvotes with interest? Hahaha you’re an absolute clown. Parties must be your thing though you seem really fun.

I must try and find it, as it was pretty awesome.  Him talking about being a kid, laying on bed, spending hours staring at the booklets etc.  Was a great glimpse into the rarely seen personal life of Jobs, especially in such a public fashion."

2021-04-09 22:27:56,wallstreetbets,Pants-on-head retarded.  Catching a falling knife like a NFL wide reciever.
2021-04-09 22:13:57,wallstreetbets,They are moron level retard
2021-04-09 22:50:10,wallstreetbets,"No, it's the Wall Street Bet insurgents fault for not selling at a loss and allowing them to cover.

 Wall Street Bet people colluded on Stocks they said they liked, but if you ask any self respecting financial advisor they will tell you that the Wall Street Bet people committed financial terrorism. He would explain why it is terrorism, but you guys are too retarded and wouldn't understand so just take his word on it. 

You guys should feel lucky they let you trade stocks at all. Why can't you just take your 1% profit a year and be happy with it? 

Any smart person would not waist their time trying to control their own finances and would give all of their money to the professionals so they can make you 2% profit a year. 

If you were responsible you could retire at 70 and live off the $1200 a month they saved up for your retirement in a nice condo (retirement home for the retards) with your own room and bed. Heck they would even bring you jello if you asked nicely."

2021-04-09 21:55:39,wallstreetbets,Don't you think GME cashing in 3.5 million shares @168 will bring things down a bit
2021-04-10 01:31:45,wallstreetbets,I heard they're just really big in penny stocks and their penny stocks went down 50 cents and that's why they lost half their money in a month

2021-04-09 20:34:50,wallstreetbets,Yeah it's like I just explained a problem and you said and there's also this other problem so the problem I explained isn't a problem and that's weird
2021-04-09 20:40:19,wallstreetbets,"Tbf, AOC’s livestream on the topic was a shitshow as well.  Really good once it got rolling, but 45min (really) of “I don’t think they can hear me” first."
2021-04-10 13:21:11,wallstreetbets,"You are buying a share, not a bond.

When buying a share, ape A pays ape B for a share, hoping its price will go up and he can sell later on with a profit.

When buying a bond, ape A pays for the company that will pay back a little more a few years later according to the contract.

You won't help or damage a company in any way by buying shares, only betting."
2021-04-09 21:14:44,wallstreetbets,"Well let’s see I opened my position at 230+, I think we’ve made good progress so far, I’m certainly happy with it. Considering closing it on Monday. 

Talking people out of a squeeze? Eh that’s not really me, at most I encourage folks to set reasonable expectations. I’ve been asked a few times if I think it’s still possible, so I answer but other than that I’ve been trying to come up with something to do for all the newly crowned by holders. Maybe a custom GME tote bag with one of those golden chocolates for each share you’re bag holding."

2021-04-10 07:06:24,wallstreetbets,"🤔hmm, Jello you say.. which flavor?"
2021-04-09 22:23:48,wallstreetbets,The announcement was actually that they are reducing the number of shares to 3.5 million from six and increasing the maximum price that they want for them to 1 billion from 100 million. All companies offer stock as a way to make money on the price of their stock.
2021-04-10 00:51:52,wallstreetbets,"Institutional ownership alone is 105% of the float. Who knows how much more retail owns, probably at the very least another 100%. So no, even if they do actually issue another 3.5 million shares I don’t believe it will bring down the price considering the hedge funds have shorted 60+ million shares."

2021-04-10 08:26:39,wallstreetbets,"LOL!  That's actually pretty funny, because if you actually knew me in real life, you would be **so** sick of hearing me bitch about our how trashfire mass media is responsible for the angry, lazy, retarded idiocracy that we've been living in for the last 20 years.

I'm kind of one trick pony when it comes to blaming media for populism."
2021-04-09 20:37:05,wallstreetbets,I have no idea what you're trying to communicate with any of your comments.
2021-04-10 13:38:30,wallstreetbets,Can’t the company sell shares at the current market price to raise capital though?
2021-04-09 21:27:24,wallstreetbets,"Well a quick glance at your comments shows that you’re full of shit lol pretty much all you’ve been doing is trying to convince people that there’s no squeeze and no fundamentals. 

Smart plays so far tho I’ll give it to you. I don’t have to agree with or even remotely tolerate your assholeishness and general douchebaggery I’ve seen in most of your comments, but the only thing that matters in WSB is if you made money. And since it seems like you did, my hats off to you and I applaud you. 

As for me, my average cost is about 53 dollars so I ain’t bagholding shit, I’ll ride this fucker to the end. 

Good luck in the future though lol you’re playing with fire shorting GME, I hope you do it more and I hope you use that new shiny money to buy some long term puts to really put your money where your mouth is. If of course you still believe the company is worthless, it should be the smart play no?"
2021-04-10 12:16:52,wallstreetbets,"Green, it will always be green to remind you of the money they saved you."
2021-04-10 00:12:39,wallstreetbets,I'd rather give my money to GME for moon renovations than to those heggies cucks for fake IOU's...all day long buddy.

2021-04-09 20:10:05,wallstreetbets,LOL.
2021-04-10 17:52:20,wallstreetbets,"If they dilute the existing shares, the share price will drop usually accordingly or more (where you get into psychology and sentiment).

If a company announces they're issuing 25% more shares, existing share value will typically drop 25%.

Sometimes sentiment will mean its more like 30% (fear) or 20% (hope)."
2021-04-09 21:35:22,wallstreetbets,"This seems to be a common misconception. I don’t think GameStop is worthless. They’re an important part of the industry I work in.

But I also don’t think they’re a 230+$ stock, there is room for middle ground even if no one here recognizes it.

I am short 500 shares and I own 5 long calls as a hedge at Fidelity’s suggestion to prevent a visit from large marge. But that’s it, no need to buy puts, I am happy with where things sit now.
Besides there’s that old saying about bulls bears and pigs..

There’s also a difference between me telling people they’re not getting a million dollars a share or 3x the us economy and that a price spike isn’t happening. I’m guilty of one, but not the other. Though after today’s news from Melvin a price spike seems unlikely.

And 53$ is awesome dude, I would encourage you to yank your basis so you’re just playing with house money."

If PLTR hits $40 I won't be retiring early rich but I'll become enough of a thousandaire that I might adopt a rescue dog and name him Lambo.

Some analysts think pltr’s commercial growth is not fast enough to justify the current price level of 23, but what the analyst fails to predict is the exponential adoption rate of pltr’s Foundry software by every industry. Karp himself said that in the not so distant future, corporations will have to use pltr’s software in order to stay relevant and survive. There have been so many cases of pltr’s software saving companies hundreds of millions of dollars. The software is fully vertically integrated and unlocks so much potential value of a company. In this sense, Pltr is basically a ticking time bomb to explode to 40+ a share once investors realize this is almost a mandatory software for any major corporations. Pltr’s software is too complex for any competitor to imitate or compete against. Pltr has already become too important of a company for US and western world to fail. Karp takes immense pride that Pltr aid US to  have the best military and industrial software in the AI arms race. Now finally on demo day, Pltr is proving their deep value in commercial application of Foundry software from consumer retail to pharmaceuticals. Last demo mainly focused on Gotham and the fundamental structure of Foundary. For this upcoming demo, Karp will present how Pltr’s software compliments every single industry and companies in Fortune 500. It is not an exaggeration that all 500 of the Fortune 500 companies will be using Pltr software one way or another in the next decades. Karp sees this happening himself and the guy is not joking. Karp is very cautious about not drawing too much attention to the stock but it is no secret that Pltr’s true value is far greater than 23 a share. Kathie woods bought during all the dips at 12, 18, 25, 23, etc. So you get the point how Pltr is one of her deep value picks."

It is now a powerful computer network in which it uses the minds of Criminally Asymptomatic brains to endlessly measures the biometrics of citizens' brains and mentalities using a ""cymatic scan."" The resulting assessment is called a Palantir-Pass, which includes a numeric Crime Coefficient index, revealing the citizen's criminality potential, and a color-coded Hue, alerting law enforcement to other data, as well as the improvement or decline of said Palantir-Pass. When a targeted individual's Crime Coefficient index exceeds the accepted threshold (100), they are pursued, apprehended, and either arrested or decomposed by the field officers of the Police Department.

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On March 23 the price of **SPY 6/18/21 $320** strike leap calls was **2.50**. Lets say we used $25k to buy 100 contracts and hold until expiration.

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the ask price of **92.17** which gives us a total value of:

#$921,700

Some analysts think pltr’s commercial growth is not fast enough to justify the current price level of 23, but what the analyst fails to predict is the exponential adoption rate of pltr’s Foundry software by every industry. Karp himself said that in the not so distant future, corporations will have to use pltr’s software in order to stay relevant and survive. There have been so many cases of pltr’s software saving companies hundreds of millions of dollars. The software is fully vertically integrated and unlocks so much potential value of a company. In this sense, Pltr is basically a ticking time bomb to explode to 40+ a share once investors realize this is almost a mandatory software for any major corporations. Pltr’s software is too complex for any competitor to imitate or compete against."

Think about that. Is this company worth more than 2 billion? How valuable is this service to people? Is uninterrupted connectivity important to people today and in the future? Could this stock go to 25 billion? 100 billion? Could it go 10x or 50x ? Would a billion people pay $1/month for this? Would that equal $12 billion a year revenue?"

This amounts to a firm slam on the wrist in comparison to what was expected.

That said while this might be the end of the probe into BABA itself it doesn't necessarily mean the end of additional regulations.

Personally I think additional regulations favour existing players. See here US and European markets where anti-monopoly rules have effectively done the opposite of their design and entrenched big players with regulatory capture.
However annoucement of said regulations will still likely be bad for BABA and TCEHY."

YES I’M SHORT & WILL MAKE A KILLING LIKE I DID LAST TIME THEY REPORTED.  


1. Most Importan -Membership program; 80% of the members got the service included for 1 year w the purchase of a device.  It was actually cheaper to get the camara w the membership than w/o.  This means no revenue has been collected & doubt most will actually pay for it when their trial is over. 
2. 30X PE nothing else to say about this crazy valuation 
3. Small Caps rallied hard and juice is about to run out (Rus 2K)
4. GOPRO went public in 1993 and in all these years they still aren’t profitable.  WHAT??? 
5. The so called CEO just last week sold 200K shares or $2.5MM.  Never a good sign when the captain of the boat sheds a significant percentage of his shares specially just a couple of week away from reporting earnings.  

Good luck if you are long not sure if this is just a broken company or a tragedy."

Tonight I took a 10:47 video of a man who was in suspicion of a DUI while being pulled over by police. This was a person of color. I took out my phone and recorded it because I am not far from Minneapolis and I did not want to see another George Floyd in my hometown. The arrest went smoothly, but for the first time since I’ve had this phone, I did not have cellular data so I could not live-stream the encounter. After the encounter a law enforcement officer came over and interviewed me and asked if I had a video of it all. I told him I did and complied and gave him my license and phone number in case they needed the video for evidence. I called my mother about how strange it was I didn’t have data, the call dropped twice. While writing this paragraph, Reddit was closed out once and I lost half of what I was writing. Both completely not normal things to happen, considering I usually have LTE in this town. Very strange and I wanted to share these weird events. Thank you"

\- The Aphria live audio meeting will take place on April 14th at 4:00pm EST at [www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APHA2021](https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APHA2021)

\- The Tilray meeting will take place on April 16th at 11:00am EST at [www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/TLRY2021SM](https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/TLRY2021SM)

\- shareholders of APHA will receive 0.8381 of a share of TLRY at the merger (I wonder why Tilray's trading lower than Aphria right now? *edit: oh, my broker shows tilray in USD but aphria in CAD so it's confusing, they're trading at roughly .833 difference which is normal*)

\- the two companies combined will create the world's largest global cannabis company, with pro forma revenue of US$685m (C$874m) for the last 12 mo. prior to the Dec.16/20 merger announcement.

\- shareholders will vote on approvals for Tilray's charter amendment, share issuance, advisory compensation, and adjournment proposals to revise them;

\- increase the authorized capital stock of TLRY from 743,333,333 shares to 900,000,000 (890m class 2 common, 10m preferred)

There's a lot of information to pore over in the booklet, these are just some quick points. I am not a financial advisor, use this information at your own peril.

I'm not ***saying*** 'buy Tilray' but it's a good stock and it always has been, and it's on discount right now.

2021-04-10 00:56:15,wallstreetbets,"Bro find things that make you happy and pursue them. “You’re supposed to be drinking on Friday nights” or “dating the hottest chic” is all made up fiction. For 99.99% of us normal people we observe others living great lives but none of them are happy either. You could be happy playing stocks, drinking with a friend, chatting online, watching some tv shows or going for hikes/walks/meetup groups (which is what makes me happy) or saving money to see new countries. That’s real life. This BS they program in you will not make you happy and a small minority of people actually have those lives. It took me a long time to figure it out but don’t wait until your 50 to realize you want to go to Kenya and see the migration or climb a mountain in south east Asia or join a rock climbing class. Spend more time figuring what works for you. Btw girls don’t find me attractive either and never have. All my married friends cheat anyway, even the girls do.  So it’s all just BS and looks good from the outside. Wish you all the best."
2021-04-10 00:49:11,wallstreetbets,It's your awkwardness. I can feel it reading this post. Looks don't matter lol. The 4 foot 3 Asian dude that doesn't get girls only becomes awkward when he blames his looks. There's enough girls out there that you should find a match. Even autistic people find other autistic people to date. If your jacked and have a good body your face don't mean shit. Girls with nice bodies and ugly faces aren't undateable

I got 2 Y splitters and a timer and 4 soaker hoses and it actually worked.  I used so much seed and fertilizer that when I pushed on it, it pushed back, it was the finest and most dense grass I've ever seen, truly amazing shit.

I aspire to get a house with a modestly small yard one day so I can devote a lot of time to a small chunk of incredibly green amazing grass.  It's literally the only thing I miss about running my HOA."

Edit. I highly suggest foreign school too. Turn a trip and education in to a cool life experience, meet all sorts new people, and save tons of money in the process. At otherwise very accredited schools."

Uncle Bruce is a former stock broker and business owner and talk about several stocks with a lot of emphasis on Gamestop the last months.

He talks about:

His experiences

Mergers like 23andMe (VGAC) and a couple others. ACIC and Archer Aviation. I have 200$ in one and 400$ in the other.

NCL

More.

Some people doesn't like him for some reason, but in my opinion he has good insight and seems genuinly enthusiastic about GME and talks a lot about it.

Personally I have gained a lot of insight from listening to several hours of him giving advice and providing his view on the situation."

2021-04-10 14:00:50,wallstreetbets,"It felt weird when I was in uniform and people would do that. I mean thanks but, Jesus. 

A lot of it stems from how people treated the troops who came home after Vietnam. They blamed the troops and not the politicians who sent them there. 

That has spun into worship the troops, which is also unhealthy because now people think criticizing foreign policy of any kind is somehow unpatriotic."

I think next week the stock will double as the 3.5 million shares should be going into effect that week or the week after.. i just have a feeling next week is going to be action... to the moon action..? I don't know I don't want to under estimate the heggies.. i can only hope but i think it'll drop to 140 or lower than hit 350 mid later in the week.

Don't do this, this is beyond any degeneracy and straight into scummy thievery. If that house was co-owned, you can't just take another persons money and invest it without telling them."
2021-04-10 07:50:27,wallstreetbets,Could be a lot worse. You bought at a dip if you bought yesterday so if it goes back up. Even by $20 you can sell and only get Minorly yelled at. Maybe it won’t even end in divorce.

2021-04-10 15:43:07,wallstreetbets,"I saved every letter you wrote me
From the moment I read them, I knew you were mine
You said you were mine
I thought you were mine
Do you know what Angelica said
When we saw your first letter arrive?
She said
""Be careful with that one, love
He will do what it takes to survive""
You and your words flooded my senses
Your sentences left me defenseless
You built me palaces out of paragraphs
You built cathedrals
I'm re-reading the letters you wrote me
I'm searching and scanning for answers in every line
For some kind of sign, and when you were mine
The world seemed to burn
Burn
You published the letters she wrote you
You told the whole world how you brought this girl into our bed
In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives
Do you know what Angelica said
When she read what you'd done?
She said
""You have married an Icarus
He has flown too close to the sun""
You and your words, obsessed with your legacy
Your sentences border on senseless
And you are paranoid in every paragraph
How they perceive you
You, you, you
I'm erasing myself from the narrative
Let future historians wonder how Eliza reacted when you broke her heart
You have torn it all apart, I'm watching it
Burn
Watching it burn
The world has no right to my heart
The world has no place in our bed
They don't get to know what I said
I'm burning the memories
Burning the letters that might have redeemed you
You forfeit all rights to my heart
You forfeit the place in our bed
You sleep in your office instead
With only the memories of when you were mine
I hope that you burn"

The energy grid as we know is going to change. Currently our grid works like we receive energy from a power plant in our region, and that power plant send energy to our individual homes through power lines

The future of the energy grid is through something called a virtual power plant. Were instead of one power plant fuelling every home in a region, we all distribute energy to each other with batteries.

So we all have batteries in our homes/commercial buildings and can distribute energy to each other, and even if you have your own solar roof, you can generate electricity and sell to your neighbourhood, etc

THIS IS HUGE, and it is happening QUICKER than you think

For those who don’t know, Elon musk is believer in this too, he stated multiple times that Tesla energy will be bigger than the automotive side. Same reason why he’s making a fuck ton of solar roofs/batteries. 

Why I think the push for wide scale of batteries/distributed energy grid is happening right now

Tesla has been quietly installing its own virtual power plants in various regions

 https://www.google.ca/amp/s/electrek.co/2021/04/06/tesla-powerwall-power-new-virtual-power-plant-new-york/amp/

This is his next big push, he completed the EV sector, now he is going for clean energy to charge the cars. I beg you guys to research tesla energy, there’s so much to say, and not enough space. A BIG disruption in the energy sector with everyone getting from batteries/solar/distributed energy is happening


Now what does Stem inc do? They MAKE the software for virtual power plants, so they add there software onto batteries to buy/sell energy to each other/ buy energy when cheap, distribute it to somewhere if their power is out, etc. They have the been collecting data on regions, markets for ever. In fact they even have the biggest network of energy systems connected, with a fuck ton of data. DATA/AI to run thousands of batteries all at once connecting to each other and moving energy around, it constantly learns and knows what to do in every situation, when to move energy at the right price, and where, etc.  There market cap is less than 3 billion. 

Once Elon musk pushes this, which I believe he will soon, Stem inc will rocket too, and even if Stem inc doesn’t become the top player in virtual power plant software, it is a trillion+ market (bigger than the ev market) 

Stem inc doubles their sales in 2020, and already 4xd their sales in 2021 (announced in January, from contracts)


PLEASE RESEARCH Tesla energy, virtual power plants. This is the next big disruption, and stem is a baby company that’s leading it"

2021-04-10 00:08:17,wallstreetbets,"I think I'll stick to my degree over google, but thanks.

Yes, if you generated energy locally for every location then you would not experience line losses. But that's not only technically unfeasible for any appreciable amount of resedential/commercial/industrial, horrible from an environmental standpoint, and just incredibly wasteful in terms of cost and materials. You lose every advantage of scale.

Is there some comprise out there of locating large wind/solar plants closer (or within) cities to minimize distance and distribute loads? Sure, I can see that.

And maybe there is room to optimize around subsidizing central power plants with local sources. 

But this idea of yours of solar and batteries in every home, building, and industrial location is not the same thing. I don't think you have an appreciation of what sources draw most of our energy, nor the absolute sheer amount of power storage/transmit we're talking about at grid level scales.

The power grids are the largest machines humanity has ever built. You can't store any appreciable percent (that's going to make any difference environmentally) of it's whole output on battery tech. Maybe with another 50 years of development we'll see."

2021-04-10 00:26:38,wallstreetbets,"With 100% renewables, commercial/homes will need batteries in case of blackouts as theirs no generator to generate energy. And possible rooftop solar/own generation to save money 

In case of not 100% renewable energy, economics will decide the fate as solar gets cheaper and more buildings install rooftop solar, and to buy/sell energy back to grid (its economically saving you money, that’s why people are doing it today)

Not effected by blackouts - more efficient energy distribution with the more batteries + more money for people to sell their energy (and use their own if they have rooftop solar) and essential buildings will need to get batteries assuming it’s 100% renewable economy (in case of blackouts, so hospitals, etc)


The most probable cause is a total removal of utility as people generate and distribute their energy locally. As stated why above 

And even if you were right, stem inc would actually benift more as they would make money from supply/demand buying and selling, as utility’s would give the majority of energy, and it would still economically efficient for people to print money through their batteries from selling energy back to grid/buying when cheap"

And even without 100% renewable energy, it makes sense for batteries for buy/sell to grid for $$$ 

Economically for now makes sense, and will be essential once the world tries to go 100% renewable"
2021-04-10 01:39:19,wallstreetbets,"You are certainly entitled to your opinion, but I just don't think you are running any of the math or understand the scales you are talking about.

Here's some back of the envelop math:

The US used 3.8 trillion kWh in 2020.

On a daily basis that is 1.04 x 10\^10 kWh

As just a stepping off point (just to try to establish some proof of concept) let's try to store just 1% of our electricity needs for one day, or 1.04 x 10\^8 kWh.

A single Tesla power wall stores 12.2 kWh of use.

So that means we need \~8.5 x 10\^6 Tesla Power Walls or about 8.5 million installations to store 1% of 1 day of 1 country.

Oh and each location needs it's own charge control system and AC inverter in addition to the batteries. And we haven't even started to talk about generation.

Say on a good day a solar panel could produce 1.5 kWh per day (Completely unrealistic across the country as a whole but we'll go with it). So being generous you need \~8 panels per Tesla power wall to charge it in a day or a total of 68 million panels.

68 million panels running for 1 day to charge 8.5 million Tesla power walls in order to store 1% of a single days power needs of the US.

Now one might argue, ok that sounds bad, but we produce things on the scale of tens of millions all the time! Alrighty, let's run this scenario out shall we?

Of the 3.8 trillion kWh about 39% is residential (1.46 trillion kWh). So let's just try to solve that problem and hand wave away the 61% that makes up commercial and industrial applications.

Again let's just shoot for storing a single days use, but this time we're going 100% distributed generation and storage!

1.46 trillion kWh per year

\~4 billion kWh per day

\~330 million Tesla Power walls

\~2.6 billion solar panels

There are approximately 140 million homes in the US for a minimum so that means 18 panels with 2.36 power walls per house. Now considering seasonal angles, non-tracking roof installations, people not cleaning them, and general cloud cover you'd realistically need to up the panel count by 30-50% or call it 25 panels per house.

Doable? Technically, yes. If we can put a car at every home we could probably manage this too.

Oh but a Tesla power wall has an average lifespan of \~6 years and a solar panel \~27 years. So on average every year you now need to produce 55 million power walls and 100 million solar panels.

Recycling is a bitch and a half so we now throw out call it 80% of the material. **So now EVERY YEAR we throw out 44 million power walls and 80 million solar panels.** We have now successfully made our electrical grid worse for the environment by a pretty significant factor, increased the cost by tens of billions, and increased the complexity orders of magnitude.

(Yes, I realize solar panels will have to be thrown out from centralized installations. But this is much much more efficient by having utilities maintain them properly and by the fact that centralized wind/water/nuclear will make up the a huge portion of the generation - all things that you cannot scale down to the home level.)

I'd have to use another envelope to address all the additional hardware required at each house, let along the cost of yearly installations and maintenance from transferring the burden of an entire national utility onto the homeowner.

And we haven't even gotten to the other 60% of consumption yet. Or any other countries...

And don't forget that all the energy consumption from petroleum products will be switching over to grid consumption in the coming decades so we honestly haven't even addressed probably 80% of total power usage come 2050.

I need more envelops."

And more likely than not even more conclusively? Why would they decide to go through with this if even their scrap math didn’t add up?"
2021-04-10 11:36:02,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely fair point.

1. My main point is just to be aware of the basic principles before throwing money at idealistic projects.

2. I'm sure there is money to be made for some of these companies at local levels. Just because I don't think its a solution to any of the big problems doesn't means it wouldn't offer certain benefits to individuals or businesses. My main complaint was the OP's claim that this was going to be the new standard and solve all our problems. Even if not an over-reaching solution to everything smart grid technologies are absolutely a necessary part of the puzzle. Totally support them - tho I still think home level solar and battery tech is stupid and accomplishes absolutely zilch, people will pay for it either for the perceived independence, the feeling that they're being environmentally ""good"", or because there is a decent ROI with electric costs.

3. The implementation of battery storage on the grid is stupid in my opinion. BUT every technology needs R&D, which requires funding, which requires market penetration. So even if they add nothing meaningful, the economics of it can prove useful to push adoption, generate funding, continue R&D, and develop the tech until it does make a difference. Solar panels went through this is the 90's/2000's.

4. There's a huge need to generate clean energy and find a way to store it. Particularly the storage problem is as old as the grid itself. With current public and investor sentiment around tech and green energy there's a shit done of money to be made in speculative business. What company wouldn't want to raise a few billion in investor funding and hope they can figure out how to turn a profit down the road? The energy sector is full of promises and idealistic dreams in order to lure investor money. That's fine, but just be wary of the 9 out of 10 that fail because they never actually solved any fundamental problem and no one bothered to do some napkin math in their product.

I only advocate people do their own research. I'm absolutely for investing in disruptive tech. You might hit the next Amazon, Apple, or Tesla. But then again you might throw your money at the next Theranos or Solar Roadways."
2021-04-10 11:48:50,wallstreetbets,"Haha, I loved those crowdfunded tech thingies from a few years ago. The articles I read about them were all hilarious. Remember the one where they were gonna make a Star Wars style underwater breather that was chemically impossible?

I fully agree with you on those points. Regardless if this comes to fruition I’m always happy to see serious investment in the energy sector, it’s essential as we move forward. While I don’t like Musk his track record is pretty good when it comes to these side projects (pretend the frictionless trains never happened 😉) . I have high hopes for this personally."
2021-04-10 12:49:14,wallstreetbets,"Totally agreed. Love tech and I appreciate the disruption to the status quo Tesla represents.

But yes, let's not forget the hyperloop."

2021-04-10 00:48:57,wallstreetbets,"I'm terrified of moving out of Robinhood in fear that it might moon, so I bought some on TDA, Chase, and Fidelity."

2021-04-10 09:08:12,wallstreetbets,Wtf my partial transfer has been at Step 2 at RH the past two weeks and hasn’t moved....
2021-04-10 13:37:45,wallstreetbets,What's the easiest way to do this?
2021-04-10 13:45:41,wallstreetbets,Only problem is what if RH pulls the same shit like last time and somehow stops you from being able to sell at the height of the squeeze. I just transferred over last week and it was done in 2 days. Totally worth the peace of mind.
2021-04-09 23:48:30,wallstreetbets,It’s not going to 10k a share
2021-04-10 05:01:53,wallstreetbets,"This is the real answer. Just diversify. They won't ""all"" stop us from selling right? At the end of the day, Fidelity answers to the same people, so they could be forced into shenanigans just like robinhood was the first time around."
2021-04-09 20:29:39,wallstreetbets,I initiated the transfer a few hours ago.
2021-04-10 16:07:28,wallstreetbets,Absolutely
2021-04-09 22:09:46,wallstreetbets,Sell a share or two and buy *some* originality.
2021-04-09 20:29:30,wallstreetbets,Do it sooner rather than later
2021-04-10 00:31:22,wallstreetbets,Because it's going to be way fucking more than 10k per share.
2021-04-09 20:36:58,wallstreetbets,Well done.  The piece of mind is worth it.  Looks like its adding up too with RH offering more promotions lately
2021-04-09 20:30:35,wallstreetbets,Did it a few hours ago.

2021-04-09 20:46:35,wallstreetbets,"I have tried my best to raise awareness of The Wall Street Conspiracy film via Reddit, YouTubers and YouTube channels, Twitter and discord mods and discord groups. Last I looked it has risen in views from 14,000 to 47,000. 
Why is it so important to me? I do not benefit in any way if people watch it, I don’t know the person who has put it on youtube, I do not know any of those involved in the making of it nor am I being paid to get people to watch it. 

Conspiracy film, sounds like a waste of time: the film was made following the crash in 2008 and was due to be aired in 2012. It was pulled literally just before it was due to be aired, a diluted version of about 5 mins was aired at a later date. This movie, as you will see was excellently produced and highlighted everything that is going on with GME and across the supposedly entire Free Market. This movie explains through individuals involved, lawyers, Company owners, Cancer company listing on the stock market areas including IPO’s, Dark pools, naked shorts, SEC, DTCC, Hedge-funds, Market Manipulation and congress. 

Why is it important, would it hurt us: the significance of the Ruling bodies involvement, SEC etc, the market manipulation, the failure for Congress to act means THEY can not pretend they don’t know and MORE importantly that they all know that we all know not just what is going on now but that they failed miserably to act after 2012. Us knowing the truth means we all know the lawyers we can contact, cases we can quote, that it shows genuine and verifiable support to all the DD presented by all the really smart apes in here and else where and for the public to be made aware. 

The really smart apes will, after viewing this film explain it better than I and will when they are talking to Congressmen or Women have proof to back them up. 

Not financial advice but arguably one of the most important significant part of the puzzle to make sure we are not fucker over again. The integrity of the entire free market is worth more than shitadel & co, more than a squeeze and add real pressure to support our situation. 

Where are my crayons... 

TL/DR: watch the bloody film before it is removed again: https://youtu.be/Kpyhnmd-ZbU"

Honestly probably turned my opinion around about Jack Black too - Prior to Nacho he was kind of just ""that guy who screams all the time"".

Now I look forward to seeing him in anything cause it's almost always a good time; Goosebumps, House with clocks, Jumanji, Bernie, Kung Fu Panda, Tropic Thunder, etc.

I'm sure he likes the stock too"

I was looking through some of my old plays I had made in March, and I saw my calls that expired for $T on 3/5. So, I decided to check up on good ol’ boomer stock $T and saw that it had a decent week this week. So I take a look at the options for the week of 4/16 and notice the $31c has nearly a MASSIVE 100k open interest. That’s HUGE. And as of now, the premium is only $0.04. 

Now, yes I know this stock doesn’t move. Look at the 1Y chart. It’s a sideways trading stock. BUT if it pushes back to $31 that could make anyone holding some decent money. 

**Recent News for AT&T**

**HBO MAX**

Now I know, some of you hate apes now due to GME. BUT you can’t hate the King Ape. King Kong. 

[‘Godzilla vs. Kong’ Helps HBO Max Punch Into Top 10 Most-Downloaded Apps for Q1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/godzilla-vs-kong-helps-hbo-152247145.html)

HBO Max is an American subscription video on demand streaming service owned by AT&T. Earlier this week Warner Bros. said “Godzilla vs. Kong” had a “larger viewing audience than any other film or show on HBO Max since launch” — but it didn’t provide any actual numbers.

**AT&T to record $2.8 billion gain on its pension obligations in the first quarter**

[Shares of AT&T Inc. gained 0.2% in premarket trading Friday, after the media and telecommunications company disclosed that it will record a $2.8 billion pension-related gain in the first quarter.](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/62800911-b0c0-3303-a9fb-54776be21219/at-t-to-record-2-8-billion.html)

**Bear Case**

This stock lives to stay put at $30. Just take a look at the 1Y chart. 

Kong vs Godzilla was a mediocre movie lol

It’s a boomer dividend stock. 


**Conclusion**

This was mostly an interesting find I saw. I bought 100 contracts. I bought 50 when I saw, and another 50 before writing this. All $31c 4/16. These could expire worthless, or make a pretty penny. Let’s see. 

I’m not saying it’s a buy, I’m just pointing out this to people. 

TLDR: $T $31 4/16 has 100k OI on it, lots of people betting it’ll go up."
2021-04-09 20:54:04,wallstreetbets,"AT&T have stayed low for about 10 trading days after dividend payout the past couple of times.

2021-04-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Emergency DD Boomer Edition WD-40 WDFC This is an emergency issue of Dicks& Dividends.  This stock dropped 15% today but it is for one of the worlds greatest proprietary products with a well loved company.

The reason for the dip is because their earnings call had two negative points.

https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/08/wd-40-co-wdfc-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/

1.  Their supply chain is disrupted and they have already lost or delayed sales in the US market because of it.  The North America market was the only region they saw any losses in sales (1% ) while every other market had gains of 9%+ with the company showing 12% growth overall.   

This supply chain issue is global and impacting every manufacturing company.  It's a nonsense driver and WDFC just happens to be one of the first major manufacturing earnings reports to land since heavy supply chain issues have hit.  Google the term ""Force Majeure"" and you will find that everyone has been running out of raw material and shipping is backed up.   WDFC has better recovery plans than most (have a whole new supplier almost ready to launch in full and added shifts at some suppliers) and their market shares aren't at risk because no one in the market has capacity to steal it from them.

2. They missed projected earnings.  

Earnings were still great.  They have gone up and profits are solid.  This just falls back to supply chain issues.  There wasn't enough product to sell and their warehouses are near empty.

You need to buy this now.  Even the millennial obsession with quick return options is probably fine as long as you buy the stock at the end so you can get their sweet dividends! 🛢️🦅🛢️

I don't have time to put in extra quality data like my normal boomer DD release because it is already climbing again past it's 15% dip today.   Any time before it gets to 5% drop from yesterdays close is a good buy.  After that it might take a little longer to recover but this is a super strong stock."
2021-04-09 20:11:38,wallstreetbets,They make over a 50% profit margin because they have a big name proprietary product.  240 million in gross profits a year is great for a company exhibiting growth in other markets.    I'm not telling you to marry them.  I was telling you the 15% dip for giving the same risk analysis of supply lines that will be in every manufacturing companies report for the next two quarters was insane and clearly going to correct a bit in an otherwise green market.  It did a good portion of that correction already.  I'm waiting for a bit more Monday but don't have near the confidence I did at 15% down.
2021-04-09 20:30:10,wallstreetbets,"> They make over a 50% profit margin because they have a big name proprietary product.

But their PE ratio is an eye-watering 54.  Given the price of their shares, they make very, very little money.  Hard to give a shit about their margins when shares are this expensive.

> 240 million in gross profits a year is great for a company exhibiting growth in other markets.

Their forward PE is an eye-watering 48.  Even if you account for their growth prospects, you're still paying a fuckton of money per dollar of earnings.

> I was telling you the 15% dip for giving the same risk analysis of supply lines that will be in every manufacturing companies report for the next two quarters was insane and clearly going to correct a bit in an otherwise green market.

Ignoring for a moment that it sounds like you had a stroke while writing this sentence, let's address two things:

1)  Is it fair to call it's current price of $280 a ""dip"" when it was trading at $200 just 4 months ago?

2)  Even if the bad news they're confronting is sector-wide, how does that make any difference?"
2021-04-09 20:44:30,wallstreetbets,"1. P/E ratio needs to be compared to direct competitors they are a little high but not the highest and not totally out of line.  Chemicals are a weird market.  Quaker Chemicals has a much higher PE and their standard trends are almost an exact mirror of WDFC without the 15% dip.

2. High profit margins help excuse some excess price to earnings ratio because it means they are keeping more of every dollar.

3. Market wide shortages mean that you are often losing very little market share by being out of stock.  Their growth rate isn't put at risk which is the typical major downside of inventory and supply issues.

Finally: I was right.  There was recovery.  I made money.  People who bought at 15% down made money and will probably still see some upside Monday.  So your analysis isn't playing out"

Quaker Chemical has a forward PE of 29.5-- that is considerably *lower* than WDFC's 47.5.  What, did you think I just wouldn't look it up??

Moreover, they are not direct competitors.  WDFC sells household products, consumer staples.  It's growth prospects are small, and so too should its PE ratios.  Quaker sells chemicals to industrial customers-- steel mills and the like.  And Quaker looks expensive as fuck too.

> High profit margins help excuse some excess price to earnings ratio because it means they are keeping more of every dollar.

No, they don't at all.  That is not how it works, not in the slightest.  I think you might be retarded.  No, legit, get yourself checked bro.

> Market wide shortages mean that you are often losing very little market share by being out of stock. Their growth rate isn't put at risk which is the typical major downside of inventory and supply issues.

Their growth rate isn't at risk because there basically isn't a growth rate to speak of.  You're just straight up paying $50 for a dollar of earnings.

> Finally: I was right. There was recovery. I made money. People who bought at 15% down made money and will probably still see some upside Monday. So your analysis isn't playing out

Nothing has happened yet you tard.  You're telling people to buy a $280 stock that honestly looks like it should be worth $70 and trying to tell me that because you were able to get lucky day-trading on the stock yesterday that somehow your valuation of the company is correct?

Imagine being as dumb-fuck stupid as you holy shit."
2021-04-09 23:00:55,wallstreetbets,The whole point of the DD was to buy it quickly while it was down and I legitimately encouraged options.  I'm not telling anyone to hold this forever.  The dip was excessive and it was extremely likely to correct upward which is a good catch for quick gains.  No one read this and thought about holding WDFC for the next 2 years.  Go cry into your 🥑🥂 about how it is all the boomers fault you can't afford a house or something.

2021-04-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Greatest option arbitrage ever... quick 100% reuturn with no move in the underlying...on the most boomer-ish stock there is: Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)... with chart to back it up. This picture represents an incredible arbitrage opportunity to capitalize on the sleeping market maker who is pricing the Berkshire January '22 $300 call option for $4.80.

As you can see below, these contracts were $8 three weeks ago at the same stock price of \~$265. I think there is an opportunity here to make an immediate 100% return without any change in Berkshire's stock price.

What is unique here is that vega on this call option is 0.7. I've been following this contract for the past 8 months and IV has gone up as high as 22%, compared to 16% today. If IV gets back to 20%, these contracts go up by (20-16) = 4 x 0.7 = $2.80 immediatly.

https://preview.redd.it/a17zme23n6s61.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=d24ab0001aeedb8176d1877cf4a619ea69df36e7

Icing on the cake here is that Berkshire trades for 1.27x book value compared to \~1.5x historical average. Re-rating back to the mean would get us a \~$315 stock. Berkshire is also the poster child for the ""reopening trade"" as all if its subsidiaries are cyclical in nature and exposed to the overall market recovery.

I think these contracts - the Jan '22 $300 calls - can go from $4.80 to $20+ with a little patience."

Karp takes immense pride that Pltr aid US to  have the best military and industrial software in the AI arms race. Now finally on demo day, Pltr is proving their deep value in commercial application of Foundry software from consumer retail to pharmaceuticals. Last demo mainly focused on Gotham and the fundamental structure of Foundary. For this upcoming demo, Karp will present how Pltr’s software compliments every single industry and companies in Fortune 500. It is not an exaggeration that all 500 of the Fortune 500 companies will be using Pltr software one way or another in the next decades. Karp sees this happening himself and the guy is not joking. Karp is very cautious about not drawing too much attention to the stock but it is no secret that Pltr’s true value is far greater than 23 a share. Kathie woods bought during all the dips at 12, 18, 25, 23, etc. So you get the point how Pltr is one of her deep value picks."

There have been so many cases of pltr’s software saving companies hundreds of millions of dollars. The software is fully vertically integrated and unlocks so much potential value of a company.

2021-04-09 20:01:30,wallstreetbets,"You are missing the big picture here - the person buying and exercising those contracts needs to cover a short position BUT doesn't want the underlying to raise in price when they do. Sounds to be like someone who has been stepping on order flow (taking the reverse of the buy orders) to keep the stock flat or trending down and making a shitload more selling calls because of the high IV but steadily declining share price. It would make sense on paper to continue doing this as long as possible to get that sweet, sweet premium with no risk of the position blowing up. That is until the contracts dry up and there are no more to buy and exercise. Hedgies can keep doing this over and over again until they get in too deep then need to 'balance' everything - which will be a period that they stop selling contracts and 'take a loss' while the stock price soars and they unload the short positions. After they are done and the stock skyrockets again - they will again sell hundreds of millions of dollars in high premium options and step on the order flow again. Its a money printing machine."

Selling a 12c is an agreement by you to sell 100 GME stock for $12 before the expiration date of the option if the buyer chooses to exercise.

They would immediately exercise it. You would be forced to give them 100 shares or buy 100 shares to give them."

2021-04-09 20:25:31,wallstreetbets,"This doesn't work if they are buying newly underwriting contracts from MMs. Any new option contract would need to be delta hedged which means they need to buy shares in the open market which in turn drives the prices up.

Technically they could do this by buying already existing contracts from other people holding them. 

Even then there probably aren't enough deep ITM options to cover all the short positions which means they would be buying options with strikes closer to the market price which aren't fully hedged yet. When they exercise those before expiration it will cause the price to go up as the MMs buy the remaining unhedged portion of the options on the open market.

That doesn't mean they aren't doing that though.

But if you are trying to cover your open short positions the best way to do this is covering small amounts over a long period of time so as not to cause a shock to the price. That works when the borrow fee is low which unfortunately it is now.

Assuming average volume is around $10mm they could easily cover a few hundred thousand shares over several weeks without causing a significant rise in the prices.

If you look at the finra reports over the last few months it looks like they are doing just that but then again who knows if the finra reports are accurate and what the true SI is."

I'll post it here for posterity

>Assuming that XYZ is a hard to borrow security, and that Trader A, or its broker-dealer, is 
unable (or unwilling28) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the 
short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm. Rather than paying 
the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the 
shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of 
satisfying the broker-dealer’s close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain 
its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the 
use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options.29 These trades are commonly referred to as “reset transactions,” in 
that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the 
stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of 
delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery 
obligations. The buy-writes may be (but are not always) prearranged trades between market-
makers or parties claiming to be market makers. The price in these transactions is determined so 
that the short seller pays a small price to the other market-maker for the trade, resulting in no 
economic benefit to the short seller for the reset transaction other than to give the appearance of 
meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham 
transactions in recent enforcement cases.30 Such transactions between traders or any market 
participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm’s responsibility to 
close out a failure to deliver.
31
Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and 
buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased 
shares to meet the broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from 
the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no 
intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position. 
These circumstances vary. For example, Trader A may be engaging in buy-writes with a known 
counterparty, such as another market maker (Trader B) that Trader A pays to take the other side 
of its reset transactions. In this circumstance, Trader A and Trader B agree on a price at which 
the buy-write will be transacted. The trade is consummated as a spread, with the stock and 
option portions executed at the same time. Trader A sells calls to Trader B, and Trader A buys 
shares from Trader B. The size of the trade is dictated by how many shares Trader A is required 
to deliver to appear to have closed out the settlement fail arising from his short position and 
avoid a buy-in or large borrowing fees. Trader A knows or has reason to know that the 
counterparty to the buy-write will not deliver securities in settlement of the transaction. Rather, on the same day of the buy-write, Trader B will, in almost every case, exercise the deep in-the-
money options it bought from Trader A in order to eliminate the short position created by selling 
shares to Trader A in the buy-write transaction, negating Trader A’s purchase of those shares. 
The two counterparties trade deep in-the-money calls with little to no open interest, so that 
Trader A knows that when Trader B exercises its calls, Trader A will be the one assigned32 on 
the exercised calls. As a result of the assignment on the exercised calls, Trader A has another 
delivery obligation. Trader A, or its broker-dealer, remains unable (or unwilling) to borrow 
shares to make delivery, and the reset transaction may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader 
A’s clearing firm. The result may be a persistent fail to deliver position in the security at issue.
Trader A may also be engaging in buy-writes with unknown counterparties, but structured in a 
way that Trader A knows or has reason to know that the calls will be consistently exercised and 
assigned to Trader A. In particular, Trader A’s buy-writes involve deep in-the-money calls on 
hard to borrow securities with little to no open interest. The end result is very likely the same: 
Trader A, or its broker-dealer, remains unable (or unwilling) to borrow shares to make delivery 
on the assignment of the exercised calls, and the repeated reset transactions result in a persistent 
fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm in the security at issue.
To the broker-dealer or clearing firm, it may appear that Trader A’s purchase, in the buy-write,
has allowed the broker-dealer to satisfy its close-out requirement. Trader A continues to execute 
a buy-write reset transaction whenever necessary, and by the time of expiration of its original 
Reversal, it may have given up some of the profits in the form of premiums paid for the buy-
writes, but it has maintained its short position without paying the higher cost to borrow or 
purchase shares to make delivery on the short sale. In each buy-write transaction, Trader A is 
aware that the deep in-the-money options are almost certain to be exercised (barring a sudden 
huge price drop), and it fully expects to be assigned on its short options, thus eliminating its long 
shares."

But selling the contract can give you profit. 2) when it does hit strike, there is a way to know which makes more meant. But exercise needs lots of cash at hand- cash that doesn’t make sense to keep in an investment portfolio without making it work.

It’s just that complete noobs here are buying weeklies with massive IV with no idea what they are fucking with.  I would have made over 100% holding longer as my thesis for the bounce was spot on, but I set a trailing stop loss since I was busy at work and didn’t have time to babysit it."

2021-04-09 20:02:51,wallstreetbets,Truth im desensitized now
2021-04-09 20:11:29,wallstreetbets,Seriously tho...im so DGAF with the dips at this point. All I care about now is trying to time them so I can best capitalize on the calls and shares I buy...cause I KNOW its going rocket back up.
2021-04-09 20:15:39,wallstreetbets,Swear to God this one made me laugh till cried. Funny cuz it's how it feels lol
2021-04-09 20:28:15,wallstreetbets,1917 was an underwhelming movie
2021-04-09 20:50:18,wallstreetbets,"Bought some $GME near its peak, around 375. Still not gonna sell. Memes are worth more than USD or food."

2021-04-09 22:44:52,wallstreetbets,It's a nice feeling to not give a fuck. It's even made me more profitable in my day trading of other stocks.  GME is the stonk that keep giving!!!!!
2021-04-09 23:56:32,wallstreetbets,"They aren’t dips, they are discounts"
2021-04-09 23:59:16,wallstreetbets,Joined a new company this week. Someone was screen sharing with me and he had a GME ticker on his computer. He was like yeah I've got some money invested. I was like... Yeah me too. We both laughed. Felt like that scene in Fight Club when narrator runs into Bob and figures out he's a member.
2021-04-10 00:09:50,wallstreetbets,"I averaged down big time during the $40 dip. My average is $70. If we go below $100 I’m throwing it all down. At least double my position. Please hedgies, dig that hole DEEP"

Let’s see you hold through $480–>$55 again. 

$300–>$150 is eh"
2021-04-10 03:32:53,wallstreetbets,This is the way to approach all things in life. GME pays in so many more ways than money
2021-04-10 03:44:44,wallstreetbets,I was watching the dip with intent I wanted to get another few at the lowest price. The position grows 💎💎🙌🙌🦍🦍🦍🚀🚀🚀🌝
2021-04-10 04:10:34,wallstreetbets,"Can confirm. Holding and not giving a fuck. Let me know when we launch, so I can hold some more."

2021-04-09 20:52:36,wallstreetbets,If it drops another $9 I can start averaging down again
2021-04-09 20:56:22,wallstreetbets,I really wanted sound
2021-04-09 20:59:51,wallstreetbets,When I get the daily notification that GME is down 3.5% I swipe right and put my phone away.

2021-04-09 21:28:38,wallstreetbets,I’m literally just looking at the stock price and thinking I dare em to dip it below $100 again and see what happens.

You got this, I may not have the best vocab, but my choice of words are sometimes harsh, because they aim to spit the truth, not sugar coat it. This, $gme, stocks, the entire thing, has shown me the value of human life. We are not to reduce fellow man to simply numbers. We unite as a species for the right causes, and help each other out when needed. That's whats important, that's why people keep coming back. I fell many times before I figured this shit out. I've been trying to get sober for over 11 years before I figured out, that I didn't have it figured out. The point I'm making, I joke because we need levity and humour. Also we need strong leaders in the community for the sub, who understand memes and people, and no topic is taboo if it's to help other apes."
2021-04-09 20:50:10,wallstreetbets,"100% dude. I've been to the depths and somehow pulled myself out. I'm still able to have a drink one or two nights a week, so I guess I didn't completely hit bottom before coming back up. All I can say is that sincerely acknowledging a problem is way cooler than having one and joking about it constantly. I'd rather have a sober friend who's ""less fun"" than my drinking ones, than have a homeless or dead one."

They reported an already 11% increase in profits from this years first quarter.

Investing in my future and rewarding myself for it are how I distinguish this from just any silly old gamble. Thanks man. I hope you can find some measure of acceptance, that's all it took for me, to accept that i'm just like every other ape out there, trying to find his way to the next banana branch safely. Basically just don't fall and keep moving forward. Even if you do fall, dust yourself off and try again, you're still alive, and that's what matters. I love you man. I live in Canada, and yes I do alter my mood with marijuana, but that's it. I stopped drinking and the other stuff 2 years ago. It's refreshing to hear that from you. I echoed the exact same thing to my best friend, and he actually reminded me how far I'd come , from my rock bottom, and this wasn't gambling so much as taking as risk on MYSELF, since no one else will be getting harmed from this. Ideally you do not commit more than you are able to go without. And as an addict, I've gone without food and shit for days. So ya, I agree it's some what gambling behavior, but you can't lump every ape together in the same boat. I'm here just as community support for other apes. I feel the pain alot of you guys have gone through and I just couldn't stand being silent. I love everyone here , and I honestly wouldn't have gotten through my depression this winter if it wasn't for all these memes."

Have you SEEN your name? That's retail appropriation! REE! Err $NEE! - The unfortunately named NextEra (AllDatDalton crossover special) &#x200B;

[Finally remembering to thumbnail my shit](https://preview.redd.it/ffb5jno5a6s61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be5ac18adc59d391171418d5a72b9f6c0e32ca22)

&#x200B;

GOOOOOOD  Friday, Retards!  Well, week   after Good Friday.  Whatever.   NrdRage  here with your weekly dose of   ""what weird ass company I've  never  before considered should I throw   money at this time?""  Today  we're  going to be looking at a company with a  150 billion dollar  market cap  (I know, I know, I usually shy people   away from companies  this  big)...that you've probably never even heard   of.  I give to you,  the  techgrowthboomer (?  I dunno, I guess it's a new  space) utility   company:  NextEra.  I dunno, sounds like a fucking   sporting goods   store to me.

&#x200B;

# A   fucking UTILITY  company?  Really? First you talk about a garbage  engine   maker you  trash the whole time before going long, and now you  bring   this Boomer  ass weaksauce here?

&#x200B;

Yes,   yes I  totally am.  You're  right, they are just a utility company,  which   means slow and steady  revenue streams, by and large.  But they've  got a   secret.  Well, 3:   Their CEO could steal your wife without even   trying,  and they also  happen to be the largest producer of clean energy   on the  entire  continent.  Which means they get all that sweet, sweet    unregulated  energy income.  Which also means they're afforded the    benefit of  trading like a growth stock to a certain extent.  Which also     means...oh shit, let's wait on that 3rd secret for a minute.  Added     bonus:  Even though almost every green energy stock from chargers to     producers to makers on the market has been getting gangraped the last     few weeks (they doin' my boys $BE and $CLNE dirty, man, but they're     fighters.  Stop asking, I'm still super bullish on them both...)

If     you live in the Southeast, you probably do business with these dudes    in  one way or another.  Who cares?  If you live in Duke Energy    territory,  you probably saw them roll up into Durham recently and try    and buy those  dudes out.  Big fucking deal.  They've got their fingers    in power  delivery just about everywhere, though.  With the exception   of  some  mid-Atlantic states and some areas in the Rocky Mountains,   they  stretch  from Texas to fucking those weird fucks in Prince Edward    Island.  Cue  the fucking cat memes, because none of this is    interesting.

&#x200B;

# Let's see how this turbine runs:

&#x200B;

These    guys are HUGE.   Like, that  ""massager"" your wife keeps in her    nightstand huge.  Depending on the  day, they're somewhere between 47-49    in the S&P 500, by far the  largest utility on Wall Street.  They    generate between 4 and 5  billion a quarter in revenue, and run at about  a   25% net margin.   They trade at an absolutely INSANE multiple  relative   to their peers  (about 30 compared to an average of maybe half  that for   everybody  else), so they seem really expensive at first  glance.   They're   looking at about 9% YOY growth for the next 3 years,  which is    staggeringly good for utilities, but not mind blowing as a  growth play.      As mentioned above, they get away with that valuation  because  their   positioning as a global leader in renewable energy  production  moves them   away from utility and towards growth.  There's  not an  executive in the   sector that will tell you anyone else is run  better  as a company,   though.   They've recently been on the prowl to  acquire  somebody -   anybody - in order to expand their reach and market   dominance.  Hasn't   happened yet, but with the way their stock is   valued relative to their   competitors, it's only a matter of time   before they make an M&A or   two in all-stock deals.  Their   financial house is in order, and their   overall debt load is   respectable for their market.

The     great thing about $NEE is that, not only are they ahead of the curve    in  every way in transitioning from coal to other forms of energy, but    the  costs for these technologies continue to drop, meaning that  their    margins are going to improve dramatically going forward - which  is why    they can sustain the premium valuation.  This little chart I  swiped  from   Irena

&#x200B;

So    no matter what happens re:  The  next paragraph you're about to read,    this (unlike the biotech stock I  talked about last week) is going to  be   just about the safest company  I've ever reviewed, even if my entire    thesis gets run over by a  monster truck.  It also doesn't hurt that  this   is the first stock  I've ever reviewed that ValueLine gives an A+   rating  to in terms of  safety.

# But let's get to the good stuff.  Shout-out to [/u/AllDatDalton](https://www.reddit.com/u/AllDatDalton/)     for bird dogging a lot of this information from his loft in a barn  he    rents from a kindly old man who's too tired to mince words.  Go  give   him  a like and a subscribe or whatever the fuck you kids beg for  all   day  these days.

&#x200B;

A  lot of you   idiots routinely  admit your shame in being bagholders hoping  that $ICLN   or $INRG will  do something other than fart when you poke  them with a   stick.  The  reason why these ETFs never do shit is because  the SPDJI   index only  has 30 stonks in it, and fucking $PLUG is the $AAPL  of the   clean  energy world according to it in terms of its weighting.   Which   means  if you bought in when $PLUG was rangebound from 65-70  earlier   this  year, you didn't make any tendies, and then you lost your  ass when    people got tired of $PLUG's bitch ass (Disclaimer:  I'm long  plug and    will be a bagholder until May when my calls expire worthless.     Fucking  $PLUG.  Don't buy that stock, and not just because they suck.  They're the anti-thesis of this entire ""Blackrock buying"" DD).

&#x200B;

Well,  that's   about to  change.  The number of stonks going into this is going  to   jump from 30  to....100.  At least.  Dalton (hmmm, I thought he'd be    bigger) has been  calling this the ""Blackrockageddon"", and you should    absolutely go read  his series of DD's on this topic.  I won't quote the    entire thing, but  the TL:DR is this:

&#x200B;

* On April 19th, this index gets rebalanced hardcore
* Whatever     gets added to the index, Blackrock (which, if you didn't know, is  the    Brad Wesley of the fucking investing world and the size of a mid   sized   country in terms of its assets) will be buying the ever-loving   shit out   of what's in there, because that's what they do.
* Therefore,     anything that gets added is going to get injected with a concoction   of   speed, cocaine, and some leftover Surge cola from 1998.
* This     index is going to be taking a sampling from best in breed and    influence  from a number of different sectors within the clean energy    metaverse.   Energy production, energy storage, smart grids, alternative    fuel for  vroom vrooms.  Think back now, children:  Who did I say was    the biggest  producer of renewable energy in North America?  Think   maybe  that company  might get added to a Dow tracked list?  Think   maybe, as  BY FAR the  biggest company in the entire fucking sector,   that company  might have a  disproportionately huge weighting in the   index?   If you  don't, you  might be the bad kind of retarded.  I'm   telling you this  because Dalton  has a philosophy to always ""be nice""   and he won't say  it.
* This is about as close to a sure thing as you can get.  95%, easy.

# 

# How much will Blackrock buy?

Dalton's     friend Wade says 400 million.  And he was wearing a manbun before it     was not cool, so you know you can trust him.  Actually, he had the   only   manbun in history that wasn't uncool.   My projections (this is   an   interesting thing, because he and I got interested in this shift at     about the same time) are slightly more aggressive, and I'm in the     480-520 range.  That's a lot of 1964 Buick Rivieras no matter who's     right.  These kinds of buys represent...oh jesus, almost 30 days of     volume for this company?  When you're talking this much money, you're     talking the back channels chosen retards like me use to buy our mass     quantities to consume (oddly, ThinkorSwim and JPM reserve just don't     have that much laying around), so you won't physically see it in the     order books, but you'll see an unexplainable melt-up.  Except that I     just explained it.  So there's that.

# Technical analysis, aka Man's search for faith, that sort of shit

I'm     going to do things a little differently this time because what I'm     DD'ing is really more of a momentum trade than a ""this company goin'  to    the moon, lads"" type of trade.   Instead I'm just going to show  one chart that explains   why the  hell these guys are so different from  every other utility out   there,  because I think that's all I need,  and then a quick 3 month daily.

&#x200B;

That    shit is fucking crazy.  I  mean, not ""ripping the throat out of his    enemies"" crazy, but pretty  fucking crazy.  In short, this gal's got    entirely too many brains to  have an ass like that.

One price chart, but no lines.  Just to show that it's winding up.

&#x200B;

# So, to summarize:

* Big     ass utility about to get added to the world's biggest clean energy   ETF  -  and, in fact, is likely to be the most heavily weighted stock in    that  index
* Has consistently outperformed everybody else in their sector for basically forever
* Is one of the rarer types of stock that isn't presently trading at or near it's ATH, so it's got some room to run organically
* Maybe you fucking $ICLN cucks who have been bagholding that shit ETF forever can finally break even now
* Even     if the momentum trade goes sideways, there's very low risk of   existing   tendies.  Your upside is significant, and your downside if   everything   goes as wrong as it possibly can is fairly minimal
* You     can still convince yourself as you cry in the shower about how old     you're getting that you're not REALLY old because you aren't buying a     utility company, but a Techility company, and everybody knows fusion  is    the best kind of food.
* Look     at it this way:  WHen you finally realize you ARE old and move to     Florida, owning shares of this is like getting a rebate on your     electricity bill
* I     didn't talk about it, but they recently had a 4:1 stock split, and     those usually provide some runway as people interpret the stock as     ""cheaper"".
* I     don't remember Patrick Swayze ever talking with funny accents except    in  To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar, so Dalton might    have  gone to drag.

# Price Targets:

&#x200B;

I'll     be straight:  Normally I would say it's priced pretty fairly right    now.   If not for the index shakeup, this would not have been my DD.    I've got  some short plays I'd like to talk about at some point because    the  market is going to turn to shit in May (and let me just apologize    for  not making a $DASH short DD a month ago, cause hoo-boy has that    been a  great play - hopefully some of y'all caught me talking about  it   in the  dailies).  I mean, more shit than it is right now.  As it    stands, I  think a short term target of 83 is really likely.  I've seen    long term  price targets of up to $113, but I just don't see it.  I    think $87 would  be where I'd start questioning you if you didn't take    profits.  And  remember, this entire thesis is based upon Blackrock    giving it a boost,  plus the added exposure that comes with being added    to a Dow index.  The  thesis all changes if that turns out to not    happen.

&#x200B;

# How to play it (There's always barber college if you fuck this up):

This     is a momentum play where you're just now starting to see the wind up    of  momentum (AKA ""How long you gonna be in town?  Not very long"").      Usually you'd see me advocate for some 90-120 day leaps 20% out of  the    money because usually what I talk about are mid caps with a lot  of    volatility that can flip your whole world upside down on not a lot  of    news because I like a bit of pod racing, but this trade should  resolve    itself much more quickly.  Buy some May 21 80c's ($1.50 at  the time of    this writing) and run like a thief if you want just a  little taste of    adrenaline.  If you want to play super safe, let the  underlying equity    come in a buck to the red and then buy $2 in the  money.  If you've  got   one of those working stiff retarrrrment  accounts, go into your  401k and   buy some shares.  If you want to be  ballsy about it all, grab  some   September 17 85c's for 2 bucks and  roll the dice.  The IV is  going to be   at a minimum because, even  though this thing trades at a  tech  multiple,  the IV is reminiscent of  the utility sector it lives  in.

**Commentary   that will age like milk:**    On the day of this writing, $NEE is slightly   green on yet another   no-volume largely red day where 10 stocks are   somehow making the SPY   green but most anything you'll track is red.    It'll probably fade into   red.  You might save a couple pennies.

# Position Disclaimers:

I'm     actually not going to tell you how many shares I have because it    sounds  like a ton (and, to be fair, it is) and I don't want to give off    the  impression that I'm YOLO'ing my life savings on this when the   fact  of  the matter is my managed portfolios basically is a mid sized   hedge  fund  and boring ass companies like this make up a pretty good   chunk of  that.  Fun money,  I've got 300 5/21 80c's, that I bought in   February on a hunch  about  re-balancing, and 500 6/18 75c's/ 500 6/18   77.5c (have been  building  that position since early March, so these   were OTM when I got  them).   These options, because they're so cheap,   really don't represent  a  significant holding even in my fun account   and my means of playing  this  trade is mostly via shares.

If     you're trying to shadow trade me, I don't know that the 6/18     75's/77.5's are the right choice because they're currently sitting at     about 4.60, but I only paid 1.47 for them so they made more sense for  me    than they will you.  That said, if you're risk averse, there's a    reason  why I chose June and I chose 75 when I started opening my    position.

All my love (And remember to not eat the big white mint in the urinal)

# PS:

Because     a lot of people have been asking me, as I've done DD's on a number  of    clean energy stonks:  While I think that $BE DESERVES a place in  an    index like this just because the type of clean energy they do is  so    damned unique and not represented by anybody else that is a likely  add    (nobody else getting added to this makes fucking microgrids), I   wouldn't   bet any money on it getting a spot in there.  I'll be   pleasantly   surprised if it does, but I'd put the odds of that at 20%.

HOWEVER,     since this index is tracking clean energy FUELS on top of clean   energy   generation, my boy $CLNE wants his shot at the title, and I   wouldn't  be  the least bit surprised if he gets a ticket to The Show.    Plus, I  mean  it's CALLED the Clean Energy ETF.  You can't spell Clean   Energy  ETF  without Clean Energy.

Regarding $DASH. Not sure if it was an old dd of yours or someone else. Read about it when it was sitting at $220. 

Bought a handful of March ER $160 puts and August 100 puts on $Dash that printed before theta gang and this recent nonsensical bounce could bleed me. 

$DASH full ipo lock up expiration is June or July something like that. You thinking they run up with SPY for now and buy those AUG 100 puts ~end of April?

2021-04-09 20:25:00,wallstreetbets,"100% agreed. Also, 2008 worked in their favor because they were in long, leveraged positions in shit securities backed by shit mortgages. Once it became clear it would crash, it was a simple matter of unloading the securities into unsuspecting banks, shorting the securities, shorting the banks, watching them crumble, and party on the yacht.


Not so easy to escape a short position when they're balls deep into it and using fraud and synthetic shares to escape just digs their hole deeper."
2021-04-09 22:34:26,wallstreetbets,"It’s also because FINRA which regulates this area (and which the SEC sees as its cute puppy dog that sometimes shits in the house) is made up of people from the banks (or retired from the banks) themselves. While the fact that all members of the FINRA board of governors have financial experience is a major feature when it comes to understanding what they’re supposed to regulate, it’s also huge fuckin cockroach of a bug when, as a whole, they avoid censuring their banks to the extent needed to protect the public interest. Congress should get their shit together to pass some more law because banks can’t regulate themselves. Dodd frank should’ve been more pointed in some areas such as this, and Dodd frank should involved more public participation and transparency. The SEC is doing a bit better than you think, but yea Congress can make the laws more stringent if they wanted, ie mandatory minimum fines for intentional frauds. We can help Congress do that by electing more progressives or people who understand the whole game.  

Or else there WILL be a substantial loss of confidence in the system, at least in the area of payment for order flow, and decentralization WILL take hold, thereby making regulation of the area practically useless without shutting down the internet. The economically tragic part is that there WILL be market failures even in a decentralized environment.. so some amount of regulation is potentially necessary to put the brakes on when needed.

Free market is fiction, always has been. People who fashion themselves marxists and complain about the inherent unfairness of a free market are truly a joke. 

Should there be a positive interaction between the US and marx, or even post keyenesianism, it would be phenomenal for most americans. 

There is a fundamental philosophical difference between a western left and soviet/maoist left movements.

So long as the ccp keeps their murderous hooks out...

Communists are authoritarian assholes who fuck people over because they subvert equanimity for political clientelism and corruption. 

So shall we not underestimate the murderous genociding assholes, this is indeed a serious conversation for americans to get out of the way...."
2021-04-09 23:36:12,wallstreetbets,Correct me if i'm wrong but I think you have it backwards. It was investment banks trying to get the MBS off their books unloading them onto unsuspecting investors. I think the issue people are actually upset about is that the government bailed out the risky investors rather than American families who took the hit.
2021-04-09 23:07:24,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, the confidence in the system is already lost. That's why investor activism is now a thing. It's been recognized that the teachings of your parents and grand parents when it comes to the market no longer hold water. Sure, some basics and fundamentals still apply for supply/demand of economics, but beyond that, for many gamestop proved that the street is one way closed loop. You can either break it or be broken by it, there's no longer a middle ground where stable and sound growth is a viable option. If it was, 2008 and after shocks would've never been allowed."

I mean sure it's possible they aren't doing anything with the NSA anymore, or they might be and we'd have no idea, regardless my point is they've built some epic tools for handling big data and have had / continue to have big customers. I believe they're undervalued.

We're moving to an age with even more data (AI/ML, self driving cars, next generation sequencing, etc) so PLTR keeps making more sense. Combine this with chips, GPUs, lidar, and you're on your way to being wealthier."

It’s also dangerous because newbies don’t understand the spirit of this sub was always high risk high reward, people advertising GME as a sure thing is misleading a lot of people who just straight up don’t know better."

I called in to turn margin off in my account and asked if my 1236 GME shares are being loaned out. I asked for them to be recalled if so. 

I own these shares on cash, and both reps I spoke with affirmed that they aren’t being loaned out as long as they’re not on margin. From what the last rep told me, even on a margin account, as long as you own the shares with cash, they shouldn’t be loaned out. 

I have been hearing a lot on both sides of this, so you guys should call in and double check for yourselves. 

Anyway 🚀🚀🚀"

""What if changing the world was just about being here, by showing up no matter how many times we get told we don't belong, by staying true even when we're shamed into being false, by believing in ourselves even when we're told we're too different? And if we all held onto that, if we refuse to fall in line, if we stood our ground for long enough, just maybe...the world can't help but change around us.""

From one of the greatest TV shows I have ever watched, Mr. Robot.

2021-04-10 02:20:12,wallstreetbets,"-Gabe Plotkin said there were trading days in January the volume exceeded the total float by 3-4x so it's possible the shorts could have covered.


-Gabe also said they covered their short position in GameStop in the testimony.


-Melvin Capital (Gabe Plotkin's Hedge Fund) then reported a loss of 53% in January due to their GameStop and other short positions. A loss which would only incur if they covered their position.


-Melvin Capital posts a return of more than 20% in February. Maybe they covered and have moved on to other opportunities to make money.


-Sike.


-Melvin Capital extends first-quarter losses to 49%.

If you have shares that are loaned out, recall them immediately. If you are unsure, contact your broker and make sure your shares are not loaned out. If they are make sure you can get them back and opt out of lending if you can. Otherwise you won't be able to vote at the annual meeting. Here's some information on what I know:

RH or eToro - You're screwed. They lend your share out, you have no control. Maybe they are nice and get it back for you so you can proxy vote but I am betting not... Maybe try to contact them, good luck with that...

Fidelity - Fully Paid Lending, must have $250k in assets, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall.

ETrade - Fully Paid Lending, must apply, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall. Not proven but someone told me: ETrade may apparently loan any margin share like TD. This is not what the agreement says but I would call them to be sure.

IB - Stock Yield Enhancement Program, must apply, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall your shares.

Webull - Stock Lending Income Plan, must opt in, they pick stocks to short, you must leave the program to get stocks back unless they are returned. You should probably contact them.

Schwab - Securities Lending Program, must apply, shares become part of a fund or something? You should contact them if you are unsure. I think you may have to contact them to leave the program as well to get your shares back, IDK.

TD - Looks like TD loans your margin shares out but IDK if you can opt out or if they will automatically recall your shares. It may be the same fund as Schwab, you should contact them to make sure your shares are not loaned out.

Vanguard - Securities Lending Program, but I don't know any details about it because they don't appear to be public. You'll have to probably read your agreement...

Merrill - If you have a margin account, then your shares are loaned out, regardless of whether they are bought on margin or not. I don't know if you can have them recalled, you should definitely contact them and ask about your proxy vote rights. A note, this is by far the worst margin account I have ever seen, their agreement allows them to liquidate your account without notice at anytime, it's probably not a good idea to have margin from here....

Having a margin account does not mean that your shares will be loaned out, read your agreements or talk to your broker. After reading the above broker's agreements they loan out securities in these situations, but they may also loan them out if you bought the securities with margin, i.e. borrowed money to buy on leverage. You would need to ask your broker about that, they don't really appear to disclose that or it's probably in some addendum or some shit.

If you are unsure if your shares are loaned out, you should contact your broker."

Actually, this one may be a huge PITA to write but I wonder what all of these simp stats would look like if you were to exclude replies to comments that were a reply to their parent comment.

In other words, excluding interactions like:

A posts comment (1)

B replies to A's 1 (2)

A replies to B's 2 (3) <- Exclude this one

&nbsp;

Since that's not simping, that's just conversing. And maybe also excluding replies to username mentions too.

But depending on how you have your dataset organized, that could be a huge PITA for you, in which case definitely don't worry about it. Do you have it in a SQL/SQLite database or something? Or good old CSVs/JSON?"

2021-04-10 09:59:17,wallstreetbets,"Technically you can, but it wastes either a bunch of space or it makes the queries take a lot longer.

You just have to built a depth map table

Aka a table of:

[AncestorCommentID], [DescendantCommentID], [Depth]

That way you can easily gather all descendants up to X levels down by filtering on [AncestorID] with the comment ID and then taking those with [Depth] <= (whatever depth).

Buuut like I said, it can be a huge waste of space given it's O(n²)

Edit:
I used this to spite my Databases professor in college since he said that using a Reddit archive as my course project was a bad idea and I shouldn't do it. So then of course I had to do it."

2021-04-09 23:37:47,wallstreetbets,I may go see if I can screenshot some of the frames from u/CasuallyExplained’s video there
2021-04-09 23:39:09,wallstreetbets,That’s a good idea. It would work that way
2021-04-09 23:54:59,wallstreetbets,I mean I did wonder why the flair game was always on point but never questioned it. Makes muuuuuch more sense lol
2021-04-09 23:37:26,wallstreetbets,Honestly if u/inxspot didn't reply I would've never known 🤡

2021-04-10 19:41:28,wallstreetbets,but... i was asking you 😨
2021-04-10 19:21:41,wallstreetbets,I'm finding lots of versions with text chat (Town of Salem isn't strictly Mafia-themed but it seems to be the highest quality implementation of it I've read so far. It's got a mobile app and stoof)
2021-04-10 19:17:54,wallstreetbets,"Hmm, I dunno"
2021-04-10 19:32:13,wallstreetbets,is that a yes???

2021-04-09 21:02:54,wallstreetbets,Oh shit and yes I can order online 🥳🥳
2021-04-09 21:00:50,wallstreetbets,"We used to be 300 mg per package. Then they changed it to 100. 

So most times you get a bag of 5mg or 10mg gummies. But they have everything. You can get a 100mg anything if you want. 

I’m sure you can see it by just going online."
2021-04-09 21:18:30,wallstreetbets,ya all unpinned i downloaded

2021-04-10 00:05:38,wallstreetbets,it % of posts these people made that were replies to Carrie's comments.  So /u/VacationLover1 commented 16.66% of the time as a reply to Carrie
2021-04-10 00:39:08,wallstreetbets,True. See? Doesn’t matter if I’m 85 or younger

2021-04-10 10:52:26,wallstreetbets,This little finger says fuck you 🖕
2021-04-10 10:57:21,wallstreetbets,In all seriousness. I am here to bullshit with original wsb users. I don't care if you hate GME or if you YOLO Smuckers. I tried to get to old wsb stuff but it's Gigaflooded with hype account posts. Seems like it was all cumshots and shit flinging before one day saying retard once could get you permabanned. I'd like to hear some perspectives on what happened to wsb in January with the increase in accounts outmatching the original accounts in under a month.
2021-04-10 10:59:31,wallstreetbets,Here I was hoping to build a fresh start and give you an opportunity to be cooler than me. Very simp of you rich.

2021-04-09 23:39:52,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the icons are kinda small. It's not an unreasonable guess. I have two advantages, though. I saw VL1 and Beavers discussing doing it earlier, and also custom emojis aren't supported on Bacon Reader, so all I see is "":cramer:"""

2021-04-10 18:59:53,wallstreetbets,That’s fine. That’s where I live to. In u/Memetron9000 ‘s basement.
2021-04-10 19:46:11,wallstreetbets,"I dunno...

Earth to u/FannyPackPhantom , come in please...

DB wants to know if you’re a MOD at OG’s. I don’t know what to tell her."
2021-04-10 19:44:27,wallstreetbets,"I’m permabaned there

Do you mean the smart one?"
2021-04-10 19:22:46,wallstreetbets,voice chat or bust 😤 though we could just do that in discord which would prolly be fine
2021-04-10 19:33:30,wallstreetbets,When and How would it work?
2021-04-10 19:58:39,wallstreetbets,"Ohhhh I thought it was tiny wang, carry on.

2021-04-09 20:02:57,wallstreetbets,🤔 I assumed you’d need something for them to go off of
2021-04-09 20:01:59,wallstreetbets,I wanted SPY 400 and I stopped my calls before because I was being desperate. Probably the same case here lol
2021-04-09 20:01:12,wallstreetbets,what does that have to do with this
2021-04-09 21:05:03,wallstreetbets,"Hell yeah! If you get around to trying one down the road let me know, I'm big on sharing products with friends if they're well received."
2021-04-09 21:03:04,wallstreetbets,"Oh ya I know allll about how you guys get down in the states. My company's HQ is in Florida, and I work in the industry. Ideally once our market matures we move to a model similar to yours. Canada is big on holding our hands tho, so I'm not holding my breath.

Still, both my parents have tuned into the benefits of CBD so there's always a silver lining."
2021-04-09 21:41:51,wallstreetbets,#🥺
2021-04-09 21:20:38,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but it would need to be from megathread I’d think, since all users include us and daily includes both 

So I can break our the code - doubt you have megathread"

2021-04-10 12:09:43,wallstreetbets,Can't go...
2021-04-10 12:08:54,wallstreetbets,Just get an aero press and do it by hand
2021-04-10 12:15:32,wallstreetbets,"Is that for the ones on the counter, or the ones in the wall?"
2021-04-09 20:14:32,wallstreetbets,Ah good thinking. Those disgusting little animals just don’t leave 😔
2021-04-09 23:20:55,wallstreetbets,"They all suck, that’s why"
2021-04-09 23:23:30,wallstreetbets,At least so far you are the mod banned the most
2021-04-09 23:28:40,wallstreetbets,Did you really get caught by one of the paper trading competitions?
2021-04-09 23:26:27,wallstreetbets,Ah I kinda figured.
2021-04-09 23:49:09,wallstreetbets,I'm not a smart man sometimes 🙃
2021-04-09 23:48:20,wallstreetbets,"It's always in the details.

I like sync for showing link previews inline with comments, including urls. So rick rolls etc never catch me 😎"
2021-04-10 17:06:40,wallstreetbets,Amateur radio?  Maybe he would be friends with /u/Fannypackphantom she's an AV nerd too
2021-04-10 18:38:23,wallstreetbets,I can handle those too
2021-04-10 19:02:18,wallstreetbets,/u/Memetron9000 I'm formally volunteering to be chained up in your basement.
2021-04-10 19:46:55,wallstreetbets,she claims she was banned there but why would they ban their #1 poster?
2021-04-10 19:50:36,wallstreetbets,I clarified. I’m a mod in the sub that shall not be named and never posted in OGs.
2021-04-10 19:46:04,wallstreetbets,"no, i mean the OGs one.  i thought you were top poster and mod?"
2021-04-10 19:24:35,wallstreetbets,"There are Discord bots for running mafia games, so that's a plus. No need for a moderator"
2021-04-10 19:23:39,wallstreetbets,That would work
2021-04-10 19:34:05,wallstreetbets,/u/gasolinepizza is planning out which version is best but i would totally play tonight
2021-04-10 03:05:19,wallstreetbets,"🤜🏾     🤛🏽

2021-04-09 20:06:46,wallstreetbets,"be like me, do it and watch it explode in your face"
2021-04-09 20:05:08,wallstreetbets,"That it seems like you and Fanny would like to snatch their MOD crowns off their heads and stick it where the sun don’t shine

I could be wrong tho..."
2021-04-09 21:09:07,wallstreetbets,I’m definitely going to try these because I used to take oils and vape for anxiety but it really needs to be CBD heavy because thc has made my anxiety worse over time used idk why.
2021-04-09 21:08:14,wallstreetbets,That’s cool. Sounds like a fun industry to be in!
2021-04-09 21:45:39,wallstreetbets,You missed everything that weekend. Also - turns out - you are not my simp. But I also already forget who was so you’d have to as Darkbyte lol
2021-04-09 21:21:13,wallstreetbets,"i meant unique users in unpinned per day, i dont have the daily stats.  too many comments there for me"
2021-04-09 20:13:43,wallstreetbets,"Lol all good just trying to live vicariously through you.

Sounds like a fuckin blast hitting the straightaway tho 🥵"
2021-04-09 20:27:03,wallstreetbets,whole reason I started following WSB was because of the market crash last year and the memes from successful SPY puts and then the hilarity of the ones who doubled down
2021-04-10 19:40:43,wallstreetbets,I told him to take Remy to a cafe and put a little bow tie on him. He’d leave in an hour with at least 2 girls. Fucker thinks it’s bad advice
2021-04-09 23:01:15,wallstreetbets,I literally have zero clue how to make them haha. I just use the app and I don’t think it’s an option even
2021-04-09 23:20:00,wallstreetbets,"Wait what? Lol that’s DB. 

I’m not even top 5 ☹️"
2021-04-09 23:30:40,wallstreetbets,this is fake news
2021-04-10 00:13:43,wallstreetbets,Oh of course I talk to you all the time then and  now

2021-04-10 11:47:36,wallstreetbets,"as someone who also said _next term_ after every term, it aint happening lmao"
2021-04-10 12:19:30,wallstreetbets,you guys IM NOT A BEAR I was just gambling with what the high AND LOW of the day would be and I was just super fucking off on the high

2021-04-09 23:31:50,wallstreetbets,"No. 

1. Perma ban in mod coup 1 by stormy
2. Perma ban because OIP wanted me to think I was banned so he banned me so it sent a message and unbanned me
3. I said ‘mods, ban this guy’ in a comment and OIP banned me and not him 
4. Idk what I did for that one"
2021-04-09 23:59:25,wallstreetbets,"Ooh, that's nice!"

2021-04-10 19:49:07,wallstreetbets,"I mean, crack is whack. That’s all I can  really say about that situation... 👀"
2021-04-10 19:54:16,wallstreetbets,"Wait. Voldemort has a sub?

Is it hidden in a horcrux?"
2021-04-10 19:48:06,wallstreetbets,"I never talked there. I went in, left. I have flair there [but that WAS](https://imgur.com/a/v8lWgvq) it. I’m a mod in the private though"

2021-04-10 19:36:25,wallstreetbets,"Oh shit, am I in charge of figuring out the medium? Okay back to looking real quick"
2021-04-10 19:37:17,wallstreetbets,We’ll see lmfao
2021-04-10 03:06:49,wallstreetbets,"Oh wow, that was so cool."

2021-04-09 20:09:55,wallstreetbets,Lol. Gasolinepizza said I can use a blank account.
2021-04-09 20:06:12,wallstreetbets,oh okay yeah thats accurate
2021-04-09 21:13:30,wallstreetbets,"I take it for the same reason (and bc I just like it lol). I'm slowly moving to more cbd based. I'm *trying* to buy cbd bud and some hash on the side. I've definitely become much more open to finding balanced strains.

THC is def an agonist. I have anxiety too and (mainly from edibles) can have an adverse reaction that leads to a panic attack."
2021-04-09 21:10:36,wallstreetbets,"I'm comfortable where I am. People in the industry are exactly what you'd think they're like. For better or worse lol.

I'm big into growing it, using it, and being an ambassador for it so it was a cozy fit. Plus the hardware at cost ain't bad ^except ^for ^my ^wallet ^🤭"
2021-04-09 21:49:47,wallstreetbets,"I can't win against darkbyte, she's just too good.

I wanna simp harder but finding the balance of simpy/not weird is a fine line I'm walking. DB has a major advantage there 😮‍💨

Just know the tattoo I carved into my leg isn't going anywhere just like my love for you 🖤"
2021-04-09 21:22:44,wallstreetbets,Yeah. I’ll try and see if I can get daily/megathread first before you do that - no reason for extra work
2021-04-09 20:19:24,wallstreetbets,it was CRAZY!!!

2021-04-09 20:11:15,wallstreetbets,Not how it works. Same reason US citizens cannot trade forex. EU citizens by default cannot trade US ETFs etc. There's real restrictions and they don't depend on the broker at all.

2021-04-09 22:44:29,wallstreetbets,"Sure, there are limits. My point remains - this guy is on here saying something is a sure bet, but didn't take that bet. His BS reason for not taking the bet is that he would have to fill out a form.

2021-04-09 23:57:06,wallstreetbets,"Easy version for me was:

* If you own 100 shares of something, you can sell a covered call.  ""Covered"" just means that you already have the 100 shares.

If you own 100 shares of GME that you paid $50 for, and you're willing to sell them to someone for $500 per share, they'll pay you for the opportunity, they pay you a price per share.  Right now the $500 strike for 4/30 is at $2.78 per share.

Oh, and if the share price is under $500 on 4/30, you just keep the $278 and the other person just eats the loss.

So they'll pay you $278, now, and you keep that money no matter what.

If by 4/30 GME is trading at or above $500, they have the right to buy your 100 shares from you at $500 each.  They may or may not choose to do so, but you can't stop them if they want to.

The person Buying the call is buying it from you, the Seller.  

It's all confusing as fuck at first, but just keep watching youTube videos, lol."

2021-04-09 21:54:45,wallstreetbets,"That's my whole point though..... In their minds, they are telling THEIR truth! But from our perspective, what they are saying is a LIE! Both ""truths"" can and do exist in the same space.... As strange as that may seem. 

Perspective is always relative to the individuals view point. 

Truth is always relative to the individuals perspective. 

A fact exists in and of itself at all times. But individuals can mistakenly believe they know a thing as ""fact"" but in reality have substituted their belief and think of it as fact. 

This is the GAME being played! Its not about being scared to come out and say ""x"", its just that is NOT the game being played here! The reason they dance around these issues is so those looking in get bogged down in assessing ""truth"" of what is said instead of focusing on the FACTS of what actually happened! 

We saw this when a few of the people asking questions actually tried to hold them to answer the ACTUAL question, but the ones being questioned would then go off on some rambling rant that had nothing to do with answering the question being asked. We saw it clearly in this case because the boy from Bulgaria just wasn't experienced in making spin talk flow like natural conversation..... but when a master does it, most people don't even REALISE the misdirection technique that's been used! Trump/Obama are MASTERS of it, most politicians are MASTERS of it, talking heads are MASTERS of it! 

For example I look at things a little different when it comes to facts/beliefs. At any point in time I know ""x"" but the reality of that is that what I know at that moment in time is the sum total of EVERYTHING I have been exposed to up until that moment in time..... so I don't really know anything ever, but it is my current perspective and it will constantly change and evolve as I get exposed to new information.  

As a self critical person I can look at myself and grasp I'm in a constant state of learning and growing because if I don't grasp that simple FACT, all I'm doing is stagnating!  

But for many people they genuinely believe they know something to be fact..... and turn off from taking in any information that might challenge that view point and instead live in a echo chamber. So their truth becomes..... their truth! 

Now, I'm not saying this is the case with a young boy from Bulgaria..... He comes across as a reasonable intelligent person who has been very carefully couched by a team of high priced lawyers and I'm reasonably sure those lawyers see the same grey area that I've just outlined in these replies that when asked to ""speak the truth"" that it is very subjective and YOUR truth is based on your unique perspective. If that means that a young boy growing up in Bulgaria grew up into a man who is comfortable lying through his teeth while sitting before said committee so as to try and save the company that he just used to rip off huge numbers of his users (Retail Investors) so he could help out his real customers (Hedge Funds)...... then that is the TRUTH for that young boy from Bulgaria! 

To the rest of us, his a lying POS who should be tarred and feathered, then taken out the back and flogged! And that is OUR truth!"

2021-04-10 06:02:18,wallstreetbets,"Hold for a number of reasons.

-AMC Theaters are reopening now. Godzilla vs. Kong has done fairly well. With vaccinations picking up and COVID hospitalization rates expected to go down, people are going to want to get out and see a movie. In a few months when Black Widow comes out we should see the beginning of a resurgence of crowds. Marvel Studio films are gonna put butts in the seats, no question.

-There were rumors of Amazon possibly purchasing AMC at some point. This could serve many purposes for Amazon. A chance to show off Amazon produced films and tv shows in theaters. This would increase their chances for their movies to be more awards eligible. AMC Theaters could be used as an Amazon Locker station. This would enable Amazon delivery logistics to reach even more customers. They could add a benefit to Amazon Prime for discounts at the theaters on tickets or concessions.

If Amazon does purchase AMC we could see a conversion of AMC Stock to Amazon Stock. While its unlikely this will happen, anyone holding could see their rocket to the moon converted into a Federation Starship going warp factor 9.9 to a far away star system.

It could take a while but I think AMC is going to do very well in the long run. I'm holding for these reasons."

2021-04-09 23:50:32,wallstreetbets,">Yes, all chores can be replaced. Amazon can replace walmart. Chore. Netflix can replace blockbuster. Chore. HBO can't replace movies. It's not a chore

The fuck you mean going to the movies is not a chore? You gotta stand in lines to get to the ticket booths, if it's a blockbuster release like Avengers Endgame then you gonna be waiting for hours.

You then gotta deal with the overpriced food and beverages that are sold in there, and depending on the theater you go to you won't  be allowed to take your own food.

Once you're in there and ready to watch the movie, you may have to deal with toddlers crying or kids being noisy.

There's just so many other annoying things about watching movies in the cinemas that makes it a chore even you want to see the experience itself as a pleasant, honest to God I have to wonder why cinemas still exists.

Meanwhile I really dont see what could possibly be better than see a new movie on the comfort of your home and your bed, while you have the liberty to pause movie whenever you want to go to the bathroom or grab snack in the kitchen.

>It's not a chore, its a date night. Its how you get p666y. Its not going to a person's house (or letting them come to yours) when you first meet to stream a movie from your television.

Dude, how old are you? Do you still think people go to the movies on the first date? It's literally one of the worst places you can go to meet with someone, because you two can't talk to each other, see each other and have to pay attention to the movie to get your money's worth.

Have you never heard of ""Netflix and chill""? It's a thing.

>Not just a trust thing, or a weinstein attempt, but some younger folks can't have a bf over. It's high school girls not allowed to have a boy over or vice versa. They choose an alternative, the movie experience.

LOL no, they just go to a friend's house whose parents are chill with us both being in a room, like we also did.

Amc hadn't announced any changes, are paying themselves larger bonuses, diluting shares and also aren't even a solid movie theatre. Compare amc to cinemax and the quality of the theaters amc losses every time. They aren't there to make you happy or have a good time, they don't reinvest in the company and it's only around to make money to the higher ups. At least GameStop has a plan for the future, is hiring, reinvesting and changing direction. If you compare the potential for the two gme takes the prize any day."

There are charity scams, but they're when you use your charity money to buy stuff for personal use and shit like that and people who do this nonsense are constantly prosecuted for it. If it was that easy to actually pull off the tax evasion everyone would do it.

People who needed the drug could get it through their insurance so the price wasn't a huge deal to them as access was previously terrible.  So a lot of the people who needed it were thanking him left and right for what he did.  THAT was what got me to look into it.  People unrelated to the situation were mad, but when I saw those who needed the drug thanking him I was like ""hang on, what's this?"" And that's what I found out.

2021-04-10 09:09:49,wallstreetbets,"When I point to that $2+ gain that the article mentions, that’s a gain in net earnings.  The article estimates 6 million COVID-19 vaccine doses will be administered by Rite Aid during the 1st half of the current new fiscal year that began February 28, 2021.  The new reimbursement rate of $40 per dose went into effect March 15, 2021, so let’s say that amounts to $220 million in revenue.  If half of that results in net profit, that’s $110 million or $2 per share net profit (based on 55 million outstanding shares). 

As RAD is expected to report a net loss of approximately $100 million for the prior year that ended February 27, 2021, the gain from COVID-19 vaccines alone should get Rite Aid to break even in the current fiscal year.  The improvements in financial results from the end of the pandemic lockdown and higher cold and flu product sales is where the author sees a net gain of $6 - $31 million in the current fiscal year.  A point not mentioned by the author is that earnings from the Bartell Drugs acquisition are expected to be accretive, likely during Q4 of the current fiscal year.

So overall, as the author points out, there are a number of positive upside events contributing to RAD having improved financial results this year and beyond."

2021-04-10 07:54:23,wallstreetbets,"Here's my contrarian viewpoint:

The market is NOT fucked. Globally, markets are all in confirmed long-term uptrends. Frontier markets in particular have performed well highlighting investors appetite for risk.

Just like the fall selloffs, the most recent sell offs were all followed by downward reversals and re-established uptrends. Higher lows, etc.

Inflows just hit record highs in Q1. In the last few weeks money has poured into QQQ and High Yield Junk Bonds. Again, showing investors are risk on.

The talking heads on the networks were having everyone believe that the bond/QQQ selloff had to do with valuations and inflation. I don't believe that. The fund flows tell another story. That was profit taking IMO. Cash was getting free'd up and dumped into the Russell and value.

Just as fast as it started, money left the Russell and went back into SPY and QQQ.

The VIX is still historically high but low relative to where it's been this past year. 

And lets not forget the helicopter money being dropped on the masses and a vaccine glut.

Let's recap:

Confirmed uptrend intact.
Record inflows into risk assets.
Tech regaining leadership the last few weeks.
Low VIX.
Helicopter money
Vaccine glut.
Re-opening of the Economy.

I don't see any evidence that the market is fucked."

2021-04-09 21:11:02,wallstreetbets,How did the ‘pipe dump’ (Blackstone has said explicitly that they’re in for the long haul) affect the share price of Mp and DKNG. If the interest and revenue are there the SP will climb.
2021-04-09 21:15:10,wallstreetbets,"I think his point is that appropriate valuation of such an established company will outweigh PIPE selling. The lockup has been discussed exhaustively. 

Statements indicate PIPE’s lengthy lockup period reflects their interest in participating in Foley’s M&A program going forward. Private equity  has also indicated this same interest both publicly and privately.

As FTAC’s Board of Directors’  Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination, states:  “Commitment of Paysafe’s Owners. The FTAC Board believes that the CVC  Investors, the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect  stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the  post-combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such  stockholders’ belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects  of Paysafe going forward”.

Also, as Foley recently said, “The  companies that I’m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion  dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was  always a really protected asset, besides the fact that it’s a great  asset.” Foley signaled previous communication about private equity’s  intentions : “They rolled a significant amount of their investment which  is a confidence builder. They didn’t take all their money off the  table… All of these things put together really created the confidence  among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the  stock.”

To make it more clear, last week, Eli Nagler, a Senior  Managing Director at Blackstone, signaled no urgency to exit: “We  believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to  remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a  public company.”

Also, it's also important to note that these guys are savvy players.  Strategically, any sizable exit would be timed when  prices are strong and they’d mostly likely employ PR to bolster value.   From there, they’d use off-market block trades to avoid slippage.  Otherwise they’d be trading against themselves.  At the very least, we  know they are incentivized to keep price above $12 if they want an early  exit so that provides a comfortably floor.  But, my guess is  Blackstone/CVC want much bigger gains than that."

2021-04-10 00:58:41,wallstreetbets,Yeah blood clots? No thanks. I’d rather stick a crack needle in me than AstraZeneca’s BS vax
2021-04-10 01:18:59,wallstreetbets,You’d be better off keeping your investment than paying off school. Flat apr vs your compound
2021-04-09 23:25:54,wallstreetbets,It hit 32 and some change in feb I believe.
2021-04-10 10:30:08,wallstreetbets,"I travel Ohio for work and was always sad seeing the plant sit empty while imagining the losses of the locals.  


I've never even read a whole post like this before.  Fuck it, 100 shares queued up for Monday.  #lordstownstrong"
2021-04-10 08:14:32,wallstreetbets,The difference to me is that a motor is an electronic moving part slamming against the ground when it hits these potholes.
2021-04-10 11:50:13,wallstreetbets,"Lol on robinhood you can only sell covered calls which means you gotta have 100 shares to sell 1 contract. This is called covered calls. Covered because you own the 100 shares that you are promising to sell at the strike price if it hits the strike price at expiration. 

There is also naked calls which means you are selling something that you don’t have. If the contract hits and you are forced to sell what you don’t have, you would have to purchase the stock at the market price and sell at the strike price, essentially instantly losing money. Do the math as to why robinhood doesnt offer this lol."
2021-04-09 22:22:12,wallstreetbets,"I did this with you (for a lot less) after your post.  I'm very surprised it's working, because usually whatever I do sucks.  Interested to see if it plays out!"
2021-04-09 21:37:22,wallstreetbets,Ok boomer.
2021-04-10 16:30:10,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao thank for this, you cunt"
2021-04-10 08:58:43,wallstreetbets,"I think this is a good long term play.

Will looks to buy shares, warrants and leaps next week. It won’t be the next Paypal but the potential market is huge."
2021-04-09 20:15:38,wallstreetbets,"I like this call. I might go out a little
Further even depending on how much it costs"
2021-04-09 20:49:30,wallstreetbets,It looked much better when I bought it for $300 lmao now it’s worth like $165 I’m holding on for dear life with the shakiest paper hands. Only thing keeping me from selling is time good thing I got like 6 weeks still. Lol
2021-04-09 20:53:13,wallstreetbets,"Dude if it makes you feel better my buddy and I collectively lost close to 2k in total on MGNI, ARKK, and Chargepoint calls. And we ain't rich lmao. This was in the last 6 days.

I'm holding on to my MGNI 45c 5/21 for dear life as well."
2021-04-09 21:24:55,wallstreetbets,Damn that sucks. I usually spend 100-400 on a call but once I start working again I’m going to invest normally in shares and maybe put a 1000-1500 on a long Disney call or apple or something decently in the money lol
2021-04-10 12:45:16,wallstreetbets,I enjoy reading bear cases for companies I'm heavily invested in. But yours is just terribly biased and misinformed.
2021-04-10 12:40:20,wallstreetbets,That's so subjective though. I can't find a single thing to watch on disney+. I don't like star wars and super hero movies are ok for me. Everything i watch is on VIAC.. And I'm in my mid 20s so not even like I'm watching old stuff
2021-04-10 15:41:07,wallstreetbets,"I am a paramedic in Oregon... This isn’t a device that has been widely adopted anywhere regionally that I am aware of but, in theory, the applications in EMS would be tremendous... post-motor vehicle accident/trauma internal bleeding, pregnancy heartbeat checks, code heart activity checks... there are tons of potential uses in the field... however the learning curve would be huge and would require a higher levels of training than is presently required or available for paramedics today... In a few years? Community paramedicine and out-of-hospital care is the next frontier... bring the ER to people’s homes rather than transport them to hospital is the next evolution in the field in general, imo. So in a few years? This could be YUGE!!!! What to do..."
2021-04-09 22:23:44,wallstreetbets,"Go to youtube. Set the this call is no longer in service thing as voice mail.

Calls stop quick"
2021-04-10 06:54:45,wallstreetbets,OP was wrong. Maybe next week ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face)
2021-04-10 06:56:44,wallstreetbets,Excellent technical analysis
2021-04-10 08:52:19,wallstreetbets,So much for your damn triangles. Try a 20% decrease.
2021-04-10 12:54:49,wallstreetbets,"Well, this did not happen."
2021-04-10 06:55:36,wallstreetbets,This did not age well
2021-04-10 06:37:30,wallstreetbets,Guess who’s back
2021-04-09 23:01:53,wallstreetbets,OP gayyyyyyyyyyyy
2021-04-10 07:07:58,wallstreetbets,REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
2021-04-10 14:15:05,wallstreetbets,OP's stonks astrology was stonks astrology after all
2021-04-10 19:01:12,wallstreetbets,"This TA shit is such bullshit, it’s unbelievable.

Horoscope for men"
2021-04-10 07:03:50,wallstreetbets,This aged rather poorly
2021-04-10 07:12:57,wallstreetbets,WRONG.
2021-04-10 10:11:59,wallstreetbets,Oof.
2021-04-10 13:30:04,wallstreetbets,Nope
2021-04-10 06:55:29,wallstreetbets,Who'd have thought that the horoscope for stonks would be wrong?!?!
2021-04-10 08:28:30,wallstreetbets,"""""""technical analysis"""""""
2021-04-10 10:28:11,wallstreetbets,Oh it aged fantastically. Person thought op was full of shit and they were right.
2021-04-10 06:55:53,wallstreetbets,not quite 380
2021-04-09 21:20:26,wallstreetbets,"I posted that as a 'fat chance' reminder for myself.

I believe in the stock, I just don't believe ""next week is the week"" every week."
2021-04-10 07:04:54,wallstreetbets,No diggity doubt
2021-04-10 07:23:54,wallstreetbets,Don't forget to downvote OP
2021-04-10 06:52:28,wallstreetbets,How’s this go? Another Major Key?
2021-04-10 03:41:54,wallstreetbets,"Haha did not age well, did it?"
2021-04-10 07:47:07,wallstreetbets,Not quite 180 either
2021-04-09 23:56:42,wallstreetbets,Oh I’m totally in too. If I had anymore loose change I’d average down at this point.
2021-04-10 10:28:51,wallstreetbets,Reality
2021-04-10 06:57:17,wallstreetbets,lol I saw your reply before you deleted it. Idc dude make that cash
2021-04-10 10:24:26,wallstreetbets,Thanks it didn’t age well.
2021-04-09 23:08:21,wallstreetbets,That is a solid average
2021-04-10 19:38:54,wallstreetbets,Teach me how to pick options. I pick either losers or catalysts that are well priced in. I don't understand how people keep finding these uber lucrative calls.
2021-04-09 23:32:32,wallstreetbets,"Stupid question of the day, what happens to those 500 calls next Friday?"
2021-04-10 07:48:13,wallstreetbets,"Shorters hope GME goes to $10. Imagine GME at $10, then DFV  can buy 1 mln shares with his cash. That's more than 1% of the float. This thing will never go back to $10."
2021-04-10 07:11:43,wallstreetbets,"Why so many of y'all still need an update every time gme has a bad day? DFV held at 40, he held when it dropped to 115 them jumped back the next day. If you don't have faith yet that he's still in and believe along with him that the squeeze will happen maybe you should get out. At this point faith is driving this and if you don't have the blind faith of a religious zealot at this point get off the damn bus."
2021-04-10 16:40:29,wallstreetbets,How much would he need to pay to exercise those calls?
2021-04-10 17:35:56,wallstreetbets,Why are you not buying more? 😁
2021-04-10 12:47:54,wallstreetbets,Fucking legend
2021-04-10 14:48:05,wallstreetbets,This guy!
2021-04-10 03:05:40,wallstreetbets,"Caught offguard...Isn't all this HFs AI trading? Doubt some guy pushing buttons and here is why the baby squeeze happen last time in Jan the computer did as it was told to close option to prevent damage... Im just an ape, I have no idea what i am talking about. But maybe some know how this actually works?"
2021-04-09 23:34:50,wallstreetbets,"Sorry man :( I picked up AMZN on Tuesday and got lucky, really shows you have to get the timing perfect to hit short options"
2021-04-10 02:13:53,wallstreetbets,How much did you make? Congratulations and fuck you.
2021-04-10 09:16:53,wallstreetbets,Any update? Still holding!?!
2021-04-10 08:12:31,wallstreetbets,u/irishdud1 Are you okay my dude?
2021-04-10 10:45:31,wallstreetbets,he said he had like 10k in November rofl
2021-04-10 02:18:09,wallstreetbets,Still waiting for that bounce to anything north of $45 on my 4/16 calls. 🙄
