03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you have one for amount of wives who get boyfriends over the whole period?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe because most AMC posts get deleted on WSB? Lmao what a joke

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn't worry too much about this. It went down cause it keeps getting shorted like crazy. As soon as more people realize the potential, it will moon. If it's not now, once CEO distribute his share to more institution so they get a piece of the pie, it will moon then."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah. Rkt will moon. Patience is the key to all of this. It's coming and sooner than you think. I have calls and shares, currently down but have already profited many times over my initial investment and I'm not selling shit"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Start selling covered calls. Premiums are high do to the volitility. If you want to be safe and at least break even, sell at a premium/strike that gets you close to a zero loss. If you want to gamble a bit, sell lower, but know that if the stock rockets past your strike, you might lose some upwards gains. Personally, I'd go for a longer date, maybe 3 or so months out because I think RKT will settle down and IV will tank. Long term, they are definitely not a bad company, but your price is a bit high. 

April 16 $34.89c is netting about $140 in premium, and if it blew through that, you'd still make a small percentage."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Could have told you RKT was literally retarded
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats what happens when you paperhand GME and jump on another hype stock what spammers created in couple hours and killed in a day. Same spammers who where spamming weed stocks here.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Fell for the hedge trap smh
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Big LOL
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"i'd like to, but i see a lot of people praying for a gamma or short squeeze, so i'm a bit wary.  

for at least the 1st half of 2021, i think there's too much risk for it to shoot up, given that HF's can probably play this as a quasi-meme stock.  because of my fear with that, which may be irrational, i may just sit tight until after the next earnings report and then look to do something"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"also, the institutional investors it has...you really couldn't ask for better ones...so i'm just patiently waiting for it to hopefully go stratosphere....just a bummer the money's tied up in a loss"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,nah. that's not what happened
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You are in deep waters now. Don't sell and hold at least untill it went up again and sell.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Somebody is not happy with my answer and downvoted me. Bro i'm hard in these kind of things. I write it so you guys don't make this kind of mistakes again. From yahoo board or stocktwits a group guys plan to hype a stock they start to spam here on daily mega thread and start to post spam posts to Let the wheel roll and hype it. Couple hours later you see out of nowhere die hard fans of the stock screaming to buy more and go to the moon. Next day all of them are gone after they dump it with profit. And bag holders are here.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice analyse. That day when it started i was here and they where downvoting every message in daily threat about other stocks in seconds.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those April calls are free money, I get your hesitation to sell leaps or go with a low strike price, but realistically, unless their is a crazy catalyst, it is unlikely we see RKT going to $35+ anytime soon. Definitely do what you feel comfortable with though, but even the $40 strikes are paying over $1.00 per share. Why not collect some tendies while waiting out the slump?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôll take some time. I do believe it won‚Äôt be a loss for you eventually. Just might not be crazy gains, unfortunately"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe average down... I keep buying ü¶ßü¶ß
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,are you jim cramer?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"i don't upvote or downvote, but i'm pretty sure that's a basic element of the site...people upvote and downvote..no need to cry about it"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME is the same, its just easier to manipulate given the sentiment. Even the hedge funds are on it now. Only idiots thinks they are fighting the hedgies. The play is getting people hooked on worthless calls and puts now.

Have my trailing loss ready to trigger."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"hahah yeah, GME people got pretty savage when RKT was soaring...i saw them being just all out viscous trying to opine against the stock and doing stupid shit like spamming negativity about it.....changed me view of them.."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"i hear ya man...i want to do it, but it would be my first option trade so that adds to the hesitancy....i may come back to you after i do some reading, but i'm mainly expecting the market as a whole to go down in Q3 or Q4 so i'd rather be sitting in cash as soon as RKT allows me to"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,i'm with ya
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,We don't care if the hedge funds are in or not we squeeze if they short and go long together with them if they choose our side. You are stupid to think that people bought GME only to fight with hedge funds. People start the fight against hedge funds because they don't want to see blockbuster 2.0 ownage.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah that's my reasoning for why i think the stock will jump up again...i have to believe that 

1 - HF's see it as an opportunity to cause a short squeeze, (especially when they have a company that is building ammo to cause a squeeze;

&#x200B;

2 - they know if the stock can get the momentum train going...so it just seems logical to me that they would want to take advantage of that once more

&#x200B;

3.  on another note, its top 4 inst'l owners are: invesco, blackrock and vanguard.......best in the business"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gamestop has huge potential and there is a huge support from the community. Gaming industry is big and is still growing. Gamestop has competitors as best buy amazon and steam,  but with Ryan Cohen as the new CEO there is a big chance to beat them. Fixing the website selling hardware for gamers build a platform for streamers where you can purchase games. It's not the same with rkt. Rkt is active in finance sector like thousands of other companies. Nothing makes them unique and there debt is high. Profit marges are low it's a fight for life and dead."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, if you're thinking about bailing completely on RKT, then I can see not locking yourself in. That said, assuming RKT stays flat, you'd be collecting Theta and be able to close the calls out cheaper than you sold them for. Now, if for some reason RKT jumped up a bit, it might lock you in longer. Maybe sell 1 call and dip your feet in the water."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Copping some $400 SPY Jpow poots, they always print"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,jpow and jyellen gunna print until this blows up.  YCC cometh.  stocks will rip higher.  party until you drop.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Realistic price target for AMC considering retail interest and riding GME coattails? Last time we saw a run up to $23-25-ish. Same ballpark or higher like $30-40?

Do we also think BB might get some memestock action too?

Finally, thoughts on RKT considering macro environment?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Always print, since the policies were put into play. An extension of SLR with YCC implemented will very likely print obesely.

EDIT: I thought you said calls not puts I'm an idiot. Puts are the least likely to print this week, as we will more than likely go sideways. If not, the second most likely scenario is upwards."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I should've waited until this week to do that.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree. Especially with the economy reopening. They can't have anyone panicking about the stock market and their assets, or else nobody will be spending money in the economy."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think AMC will run up to at least $23, which will be the price where there will be a lot of tension, if it starts pushing past $26, I'm thinking a run up to $45 max. The problem with AMC is, it was never actually shorted. One of the big websites that rank high short interest stocks made a mistake and put AMC instead of AMCX, which was the one that was actually shorted, and still is. But I think it'll still build and moon off of hype/impulse/online movement/stimulus. 

I think BB will get a little bit of action, but not as much as AMC and GameStop. GameStop will still be the king of volatility this week for sure. IV is too high for my liking, so I'm not playing it. 

Depending on the Fed's policies this week, RKT will either make or break. Best case scenario for RKT is the combination of YCC and SLR being/staying implemented, because RKT might be included and seen as a tech/growth stock, anything that hinders tech/growth will hinder RKT, even if it has nothing to do with that really."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"when it blows up, there will be nowhere to hide."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,So go balls deep on $400 spy poots this week? I‚Äôm in

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What is the time frame for this to occur if you had to guess? Months? I have 1 June $20c on AMC.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I read his comment wrong, for some reason I thought he said calls. Puts are different story and are the least likely scenario to print this week."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Aw fuck I read that wrong. Best case scenario is YCC and SLR being taken off the table. Which I think is the least likely scenario for FOMC. They can't crash the stock market right now while the economy is opening back up. SPY will also likely rise due to quad witching, I think Wall Street will add more energy stocks, which will cause the SPY to rise."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh no, I was talking solely this week. I think it'll be a slow rise Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, before an impulse wave hits Thursday and Friday sending it to the moon and then right back down shortly after. I'd figure out your price target and then use a profit calculator to set a sell limit for the equivalent contract price at that AMC price."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, this explains why the shorts continue their aggressive and consistent shenanigans.  They forget what the buyers and holders of these companies are here to do, and try as they may to resist, resistance is futile."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"During the squeeze, would the short positions have to buy 110m share or just buy the ~65mil share difference between the float and extra to cover their position?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,OK now my smooth brain is starting to gain a wrinkle or two
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also, looked briefly (cramming for exam), didnt see prices, which, if prices arent easy to find, you cant afford them.

Lol, tbh, even if I made $18M by some craziness, I wouldnt spend crazy money, grew up too poor. 

The one thing I might splurge on would be some Viberg boots made with shell cordovan. I am a BIG Goodyear welted boot guy. Or heck, even a pair I havent bought second hand off the internet would be nice.

(Yes, I buy used shoes. Very cheap person)"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I can only afford like 18 shares , so in reality, memes aside I'd be lucky to get 18k

Which would be a great bit to reinvest."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not bad. Tbh, I'd appreciate the ability to buy a car if I needed it. I drive a 98 camry with 140,000 miles. Sometimes upon start up it stalls out a bit and I gotta keep the gas pedal depressed for 30 seconds until it wont shut down.

And I had to have the exhaust welded last year to get through inspection"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, it means people like you and me are now 'old'."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,They have to buy as many shares as they shorted.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,30k-150k for one of those
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Then I just hope that the institutions don't have enough shares to sell to the shorts.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay, forgive me for getting into economics, but what is the marginal utility for that? Like even if you splurged and got a $5000 mattress, what could the possible benefit be? 

Also I guess TIL there are mattresses that sell for more than my mom's house."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What does this mean to the average ape? Do we like the stock?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,thano you for this. also 4/20 wtf what a sign. yoloing my pre-stimmy tomorrow
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for putting up this notice.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,If I have shares in both do I need to get rid of one? or will they combine in my portfolio?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I gotchu. I'm just stoked that they finally announced it lol
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I have no idea. I think it's gonna spike as the merger date gets closer. Especially now that they actually announced the date
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I am not a cat
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Personally, I like the stock""

APHA 618 @ 19.54

TLRY 23 @ 57.40 (oof, I know. I had 46 but sold half when it reached $72 a few weeks ago)"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let's say this is your portfolio:

10 TLRY

20 APHA

After the merger, you will have:

10 + (20 x .8381) TLRY = 26 TLRY

There won't be fractional shares issued so you will also receive 0.76¬¢

Edit:

>**Will I receive fractional Tilray Shares?**  
>  
>No. If the total number of Tilray Shares that you will be entitled would result in a fraction of a Tilray Share being issuable, the number of Tilray Shares you will receive will be rounded down to the nearest whole Tilray Share.  
>  
>[https://www.aphriatilraytogether.com/#Faqs](https://www.aphriatilraytogether.com/#Faqs)"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"APHA will become TLRY. 

1 share of APHA = 0.8381 share of TLRY."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oof. Sorry to see you up so high for tlry, but worst comes to worst I believe you‚Äôll loose max 5% near merger date. If you‚Äôre nah holding then easily make a profit in 1-2 years there but I don‚Äôt know your plan of length."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It's all good about the TLRY. I covered my original cost basis. I'm gonna see how high APHA goes leading up to the merger and what the hype can do. If it reaches $100 or goes above I'll probably sell and then buy back in once it lowers. Otherwise I'll just ride it out because they'll be the largest cannabis company in the world. So we'll see what the hype can do
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've seen lots of bullish TA on GME. Keep in mind, ALL TA requires volume to play out how it should. We haven't had any volume on GME in over a week.

Holding shares simply isn't enough - needs constant (all day every single day) buying of shares and IN THE MONEY options.

If you buy options that are 20-30% in the money they literally can't price pin because they can't get and keep the price 20-30% below current market. So you force immediate share buying by market makers to hedge, and virtually eliminate their means of counter-attack which has been price pinning at the point of maximum pain (price at which most contracts expire worthless).

If you are intending to help push the squeeze, buy shares throughout the day every day. If you are playing options, mostly buy calls in the money. If you're buying OTM calls, buy as close to current price as you can afford. The more imbalanced OTM calls are, the more they're just going to price pin at maximum pain. They literally cannot do this if there is a ridiculous amount of new ITM call interest that they have to buy shares to hedge."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,But you‚Äôre forgetting to take into account that the last peak in January was massively stunted. It was on its way to break 1k back then.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt know shit about fractal analysis but it does look like solid grounds, however the January rectangle takes into account the buying restrictions.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I also got drunk and drew a bunch of lines on the stonk chart last night trying to look for some sort of channel, support, resistance, or basically fucking ANYTHING that looked reasonable.  For the most part, I ignored your fractal as an anomaly and focused on the more long-term but it still didn't make any fucking sense.  After much struggling and a lot of trend lines, I had eventually drawn a chartreuse four-dimensional hyper-imaginary icosahedron and discovered something important:  the lines on my chart, much like the shape I described, meant nothing whatsoever.  The best I could do was switch the chart to exponential instead of linear and then look at hourlies for the last three months and there does appear to be a cyclic pattern of the price doubling at an interval that appears to have a different pattern (I was too drunk to identify it specifically by that point but it was there), but the thing is that the volume didn't hold across the cyclic pattern that I saw which means that it's probably not all that useful.  If any of the lines I drew on my chart before I got too drunk to use a mouse actually meant anything, then we're looking at an exponential curve up to $400 over the course of the next week or two maybe with some steady growth that gradually pushes the price up and then it rockets to double the value it was at the end of the previous cycle (around $190 or so, maybe a bit higher so roughly $400 is the high end of the next cycle).  That's the best I could do and I forgot to save the picture, but I did find that I've got like 8 beers left so maybe I'll try to do this again tonight and see what happens."

EDIT: Just to be perfectly clear on exactly what we shouldn‚Äôt do‚Äîwe really shouldn‚Äôt wait for that initial  panic dip to bottom out, and THEN all of us buy. Really, don‚Äôt do that, everybody, because I certainly think it **can‚Äôt not** go tits up.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Their reports read like an intern wrote it. There are solid short sellers that should be listened to. This group isn‚Äôt one of them.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know people on this sub like to hate short sellers and hindenburg has been wrong in the past but you are willfully ignoring some of the worrying things they mentioned in the report such as paying companies to preorder,in one case(gridx), they faked the order ‚Äò and gridxs ceo had no idea about lordstown. You can ignore claims where they got the information from ex employees but there is still alot of other things in that report that needs to be answered before i even think about investing in $ride. There is also this marketing videos where the robots seem to be assembling the car but in reality they are doing nothing...( https://youtu.be/Y-acV4YIcIw ) i hope lordstown clear up everything in a convincing way but untill then i m not touching this stock."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"All of their Nikola claims were accurate, including the fact that their only revenue was from installing solar panels in the CEO's mansion."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You may be right, but as so ‚Äúwho has more credibility‚Äù GM also partnered with NKLA. So I think their execs are more retarded than average WSB autist and wouldn‚Äôt base my investment decisions based on their DD

No position in either"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"$RIDE claims to have 100,000 pre-orders.    
    
Hindenburg pointed out that 14,000 of those were from a 2 person company in Texas based out of a dudes apartment who has zero intention or ability to purchase 14 trucks, let alone 14,000 trucks.   
    
That's straight up bullshit by $RIDE to lie to people like that.   
   
 Additionally Hindenburg pointed out notable reasons why the Sept '21 ship date for the first trucks is likely full of shit. Being first to market and having 100k preorders were the biggest selling points for me in the company. I honestly considered them a medium term investment because I think the hub motor design is bad for trucks especially but thought they would still go up until at least a month after units started shipping, but now I doubt any trucks will ship at all from them."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you avoid the mods auto removing your post?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just to counterpoint:

Steve Burns the CEO of Lordstown ran Workhorse for years.

Workhorse has been estimating they will produce thousands of vehicles a year for the past few years. All told, they've produced 370 vehicles total in 5 years. I could go find all my research I've done on Workhorse, but I'm too tired of trying to point it out and then getting downvoted. Do your own research if you want.  I hope Lordstown does well, but if they follow in the footsteps of the CEO's old company, they will constantly over promise, and under-deliver.

&#x200B;

On another note, it's fun to say shorts are stupid and yell at all the short reports. Hey, it's made us some dough. Nonetheless check the track record of the company doing the report. A ton of people always want to talk about how they attacked ""this one company he said was shit, then it boomed!"" but they ignore the dozen or more other companies they said were garbage and that then proceeded to be delisted, go bankrupt, or simply drop in price continually for years on end.Here is a list I made a day or two ago on another forum about this:

Companies that are now Lower than when Hindenburg reported:

PTE Oct 7th 2017 - $27 then, Now $1.35

OPKO Nov 17 2017 - $7 then, Now $4.44

RIOT Dec 11, 2017 - $16 then, dropped to under $5 until Jan 21st of 2021. So 3 years of it being below the price at report.

MARA  Dec 13, 2017 - $20 then, dropped to under $6 within 6 months, wasn't  until Jan 1st 2021 that it was higher than the price at report. 3 years  later than when he reported.

PLSE  Apr 24, 2018 - $18 then, was under that until December of 2020. Now  higher. Over 2 years of being below his price at report.

INPX Apr 2018, - $17 then, now $1.23

GNPX May 2018 - $12, now $5.28

APHA Dec 2018 - $7 then, bumped up to $13 briefly, then was under $7 for 2 years. Now it's $24

EROS June 7 2019, -$3.30 then, now $2.02

SDC Oct 4 2019 -$14.72 then, now $11.84

HFFG March 23 2020 - $9.66 then, Now $8.34

SCWORX Apr 17 2020 - $7 Then, Now $2.11

GNUS June 5 2020 - $5.94 then, now $2.14

NKLA Sep 10 2020 -$42 then, now $17 

LOOP Oct 13 2020 -$11.50 then, Now $8.50

KNDI Nov 30 2020 -$9.76 then, Now $7.08

Companies that are now Higher than when he reported:

ORA

IDEX

GRWG

JCOM

SRNE

OPRA

CSE

AMEH

DVA

BE

Genworth Just bounces up and down. Hasn't gained or lost steadily. $3.43 when he wrote it, $3.55 now. Not a win or loss.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure why you would hate on them, I like them for blasting a stock so I can pick up cheap shares. A lot of people have an us or them attitude towards stocks while in reality it's an us and them that generates the largest amount of profit. Too many people become so in love with a company that they find any alternate opinion to be an attack on them personally. You're buying pieces of a company and you want to buy them for a lower price to profit. If your DD and thesis on a company is showing how solid of a company they are then bring on the hit pieces, gives you the chance to buy for pennies on the dollar."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short sellers like them are great if they actually do expose crappy companies which can and does happen.  Why not leave all of the negativity and manipulation out of your post and simply say ‚Äúthis is a buying opportunity because it recently fell 20% on a short selling report and the company will be refuting that report this week‚Äù.  No need to bring out the boxing gloves, this is investing, maybe even gambling, but not a cage fight to the death.  One of you will be right, you just need to state your case, not bash your opponent, it‚Äôs not politics, and if it was you would lose."

I'm also having trouble finding info on their taxes or reported revenue, also their website is made and moderated entirely by their CEO Tim Grosse (as is everything else).

Their website hasn't changed that much since he lauched it in 2014. Higly doubt he had deals wih NASA, Merck, GM, 3M, McDonalds, Whole Foods, Abbott,... 1 year after he started the company.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I will say this. I believe the GME play may be bigger than the previous but I am certain a higher price value for GME than what it was at before RH will come.  

Now I didn‚Äôt follow DFV on Twitter until after the RH scandal so am I not familiar about those prior tweets but what he is tweeting now has me a true believer that GME will go. 

It seems like his tweets are more confident in a way. Tweeting about the cat out of the box and the image of space. 

I think DFV knows way more into the situation than he is letting on. Obviously he is staying quite for legal reason. It‚Äôs the government. If DFV even hints at something in writing that would ultimately cause a transfer of wealth the government will intervene and find a way to put him away for x amount of years. 

I am more confident than ever that GME will go and we will have money that we only dreamed about. But what makes everything so much better is that people are giving back! It warms my heart knowing that this community is more than a community. We are a family. I‚Äôm only in 30 shares but whatever GME hits I want to donate to a good cause. 

All for one and one for all. See y‚Äôall on the other side."

Own still AMD, Tesla, Amazon, Shopify and couple others since at least 5 years and plan to hold for another 5-10 year. All the profits what i made in 2020 with swingtrade went in GME. If i lose i lose. If GME goes over $1000 i plan to sell %50 and hold the rest longterm.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly selling your cat will be fine. Prob just come back to the house in a week. Rinse and repeat.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It depends, how many times do you have to scratch it before it starts purring?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Half of reddit women pawn their cat for cash
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,[And this is the Hue](https://youtu.be/dk2FVr_aOvo?t=105)
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks this way
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have no sell limit, but if the volume is high and shorts are covering and a lot of calls above $1000 with nice buy orders in the orderbook ofcourse i will hold. Huge potential if they fix the website build a platform for streamers where you can also purchase games. On the webshop they need to sell more hardware and other stuff like consoles, GPU's, Ram, Ssd disks, leds, joysticks, yokes for flight sim, rudders,  headsets, speakers, gamers mouse and mousemat, steeringwheel, 240hz and 144hz monitors, chairs for gamers, webcam, microphone and complete gamers pc's. The brand for gamers is there shops are there rent a couple warehouses in the US and Europe start selling all these hardware to world. If we all buy 1 gamers pc, monitor, headset mouse, speakerset, webcam and couple games every 2 year it's already enough to realise that market cap. Partnership with E-sports and work is done."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm stupid. I had read a lot about the company and they had good growth numbers and bright future they still didn't make money, but the future was bright with a lot of potential for large income. More and more brands and webshops are opening a pinterest account to sell products. It's a interactive social media website with thousands of webshops in it. I was saying to myself this will go over $100 easy over 3 years then i sold. Market cap was 10-15billion at that time. It was a good lesson for me. If you believe in the company and see a potential to grow never sell to early."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Best I can do is the value meal at Wendy‚Äôs.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,God that‚Äôs awful what part?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs when I got in as well. I exited green but I don‚Äôt want that sort of risk anymore.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see those options separately, but how do I get it to show like yours?
Edit: Specifically asking for what column title I need to add to get that to appear."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,that isnt how taxes work....
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys doing like an early st pattys day?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,not everyone is as lucky as we are baratom! ;)
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What national holiday is on Monday?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Better post proof tomorrow! We are watching!!!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla is definitely going up after this GME thing.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I was thinking that same...
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well in all honesty, he hasn't been reacting to me petting him lately. In fact he hasn't gotten up from his favorite spot to sleep in well over a month, and he smells awful."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The pet store
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,the lips or the legs im sure
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It amazes me how that dude can have over half a million in cash and not know that...
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, 1848 revolution."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"*Paddy's not patty's. People get upset by that. They shouldn't, but the do."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,;)
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,1848 revolution
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I will indeed post tomorrow. If I for some reason do not, I'll have my wife's husband's boyfriend release my SSN."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I think tesla will hit 1200 before the end of the week. And gme will spike to something stupid high stay there for just long enough for a few people to get out and will crash to 30
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shit dude, I think your cat might be...
Patiently waiting for GME to moon like these rest of us!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I heard there was a blind kid over by the street corner that was looking for a cat. [reference](https://youtu.be/uXEb_ODMlhs)
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I like this way
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm glad you caught that. Was getting concerned people weren't getting that the joke.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there at least green beer?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Against whom?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,When did that happen
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeaaaa I really don't think TSLA is hitting 1200 this week. I mean id be hyped if it did. But I think it'll be a month or so before we even see it above 800 again.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not going back down to 30. It may drop but $200+ is the actual value of it now. Even without the squeeze you have several retards on here who own a million something shares each and are competing to own the company.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Okay shill
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Every single thing you predicted in that comment is wrong.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. We remember national heroes that died in the revolution, 
It is not a happy holiday yet one of the most important one."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Green beer, green tendies, green tittles, and the market fkn lit up the ass green."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Habsburgs.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It will it won't stay there though.   With all the stimulus it will jump then settle to 850
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Check their history. Active till 7 months ago with zero stock talk and now nothing but gme and stock talk for the last 30 days. Sus as fuck.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh it's gonna drop to 30 then down to 15.  Because those people when it hits the highs will all pull out.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Shill really that's all you got?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope so.  I hope we  make money
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"We only have one holiday in the US. We just celebrate it multiple times a year, give it different names, and consume different types/colors of alcohol.

It's a happy holiday."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean I hope you're right. I'd love to cash out with a 100% gain on that stock.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Which one if us are you talking about?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think you understand how much gamers want this to succeed. The ones with a million+ shares are trying to own the company. They are not pulling out their shares. Unless there is a squeeze many people won't.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your account is sus as fuck. Check out this persons history and make your own decision. But this is screaming ""bought account"" to me"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You think Cohen is worth $30? Have you lived under a rock? Are u delusional?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just so you know bro, the account you are conversing with was active 7 months ago with zero stock talk and then there is a comment blackout until a month ago and then nothing but gme and stock talk. This user is setting off alarms with me"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Effiebaby1284
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,No they don't lol they want money.  Gme has no future unless in gambling.  Gamefly/digital goods/amazon/console stores.  It has zero place in the gaming market in 5 years.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Considering he's engaged in actual discussion I think he's neither a bot nor a shill. I just think he's pessimistic, which is okay."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ehhh Idk. I think predicting the future of stocks like GME is pointless these days, as this is unprecedented. But I do think GME is poised to stay in the triple digits for a while."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,They have literally made post saying they're going to own gamestop no matter what....
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also, you think too small. Ryan Cohen/GameStop followed Steam, implying they want to work with Steam, they are in talks with Ann Hand at Super League Gaming, and they have a metric ton of positive press. There has also been talk of teaming up with Tesla to do Gaming Cafe's/Recharge stations like in South Korea. The main thing gamers like myself are pushing for is the revival of good multiplayer games. This stock is our best chance at that."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about who you are responding to. You seem legit. But check out *their* history. Sus af. 

I wasn't talking about you. I was warning you.

u/Effiebaby1284 is sus af."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,He's talking about the other guy
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Bots and shills do that exact thing. Repeatedly posting about selling at 1k and also saying it will crash to 30 is still sus to me but I'm not reporting or blocking as I've talked to them.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree that gamestop isn't based on reality ATM and that's fine. But stating that there is a future in gaming just isn't true.  Not unless they do a few acquisitions.  Honestly I hate it.  I think digital goods should have a legal requirement to send the disk for like 5 dollars if asked.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Then selling when it at its high.  Then rebuying 7x those millions of shares back.  Would get them alot closer.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It really isn't.  Invest in a gaming company if you want that lol.  If anything I see gamestop crashing then when it's out the door being bought up.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://reddit.com/r/FemdomHumiliation/comments/lcq91y/_/gm3l7b6/?context=1

If its a bot or shill they went to great lengths ngl"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh my bad dawg. Yea, just by the fact he kept arguing his retarded predictions, id say he sus."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao so rather then considering my ideas the fact that you think the account was bought rather then what I am saying being a possibility.  Interesting but hey I hope you are right. I hope we make alot of money this week.  But if your entire outlook is this is the only possibility.  Maybe you are blinding yourself a little.  I prefer to explore all sides that being a crash, going sideways, to the moon.   For everything I am seeing I see gme crashing before the week.   But I have hopes that it goes up and we make money.    By the way.  Not a bought account."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep I got that... whoops.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but that will still mean the price lands above $200."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a gaming company. Again, I don't think you understand the massive potential the company has. They are starting off the bat with a huge amount of support. We're talking old sports stadiums bought up and converted to hologram gaming arenas, imagine watching Pok√©mon battles, Overwatch, new multiplayer games, horror games, and more in life size glory. Streaming services to help bridge pc/console gap and unite players. Gaming PC's sold at a loss in order to corner the market, pulling an Amazon. A merger with Steam, Tesla, and Super Leauge Gaming. It's going to be the Diamond age of Gaming, mark my words."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait lol you kink shaming now.  Hot damn.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough but there is still a six month gap in comments and a ton of 1k sell fud. 

I absolutely could be wrong here but this account is sus to me"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Check it's history. Super fuckin sus.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Explain the six month gap in comments. And immediately afterward you start posting about gme. 

I'm serious. I don't want to accuse someone of doing something that they aren't doing, I haven't blocked or reported, but to me your account is sus. If you can explain the gap in time and the multiple 1k sell fud comments I will wholeheartedly take back my accusation."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love your idea.  Don't get me wrong.   But it's capital it would be easier to again have all the people about to make bank, sell their shares and just do it under a new business model without the employees without the stores.  Their stores have been loosing money for 3 years.   Last 3 years all profit came from investments."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The replies in this thread make it seem sus yea, lots of fud without any indepth reasoning as to why their claims will happen or not"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes good catch, and my apologies again for misunderstanding who you were referring too."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Gap in comments for 6 months? Straight up? I started a new job working from home taking calls on the computer and when I am not at work I didn't want to be on the internet.    But my names in the user name lmao my name is Effie.  But I don't need to prove anything to you.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,As far as the pricing.  That's my outlook for the company.  I don't know what you want me to say.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Branding/name recognition is everything. It is basically doing it under a new company with an old name. It is far easier to convert existing locations into new stuff than it is to buy new locations. Reason being is there is a ton of paperwork/wait time/permits/paying for said permits/getting land assessed involved in setting up new locations.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,There is also a six month gap in comments and the first one after is about gme.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is cool. After 2 and a half months of dealing with this I tend to check out just about everyone's history. There are shills on both sides of this fight and we all need to keep thinking for ourselves. 

This is not a collective. We are all making independent financial decisions based on the information at hand. Shills (on both sides) try to influence our decisions for their own ends and therefore consider themselves smarter than us. 

Fuck that noise. 

Doubt everything. Verify all sources and do your own damned math. It's far to easy to be swept up in the confirmation bias. Never defer your thinking to someone else evem if its something you want to hear. 

Information is power and that includes the reddit history of everyone here."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Fair enough. I'll take it. You should know that there is zero chance of gme crashing to 30 and to say so on this sub is inviting the negativity you have received.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why are you both advocating for a sell at 1k and also saying it's going to crash to 30? 

Understand I'm trying to understand your thinking. Bots and shills are indeed thick. If you have any DD to support your claims I would love to see it, but just firing off comments trying to spread FUD is sus."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You think they are going to use existing store locations.  Permits are still required for stadiums and the name doesn't have an incredible reputation to anyone who actually games.  Being able to start WITHOUT EMPLOYEEs would be significantly cheaper.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Also if you are curious about the cycling topics.  I hyperfocus like crazy which as you scrolled I am guessing you realized topics cycled.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you have anything to say that isn't ""possibilities, hopes, dreams, oh a new board member, oh chewy""  I think this could be a 60 dollar stock within a few years and that is shown by the guy buying a 9 percent stake in the company.   But outside of that all I see are hopes and dreams and with everything those will fade. But I would like to hear your thoughts."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,As far as if you see me anywhere saying someone should protect their investment.  It's because alot of people lost their life savings last month. Another reason I moved from saying sell to saying setting trailing stop losses.  That way they will be in till it crashes.  Then their accounts will auto sell to protect them.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it will spike high.  I think it will overshoot smack a 1000.  Just because how many calls were purchased at 800, because of how much interest, because of stimulus, because of the earnings coming out next week, because of the large turn over that happens friday.  But the moment it hits a 1000 I think one of the large stock holders will sell causing a cascade effect down.  Could it be 800-1200 hopefully.  But at the end of the day.   There is no moves by the company yet other than just getting a new board member that would convince me that this is over a 15 dollar stock.  Looking at their financials the stores were loosing money for the last 3 years.   Only reason it has stayed afloat this far is their investments.  With the fact that Amazon is quicker and cheaper and the fact that gamefly already does what they would be online.  The fact that most consoles are switching to digital versions.  This is not a long term stock.   Until a single move from the company(not just wants or changing board members) shows a direction for the company to make money .  This is my expectation"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I do think they'll use existing store locations. They already have parking, many are already located in good locations, and it's cheaper to repurpose then build from scratch. Not to mention it avoids having to deal with the EPA. The stadiums were already built with taxpayer dollars. Sports attendance is dying, especially baseball. I don't think many cities would turn down the extra revenue generated from E-sporting events. The people who actually game are the ones pushing for GameStop to move into the modern age. The brand recognition is more for the normies. Example, you're a parent and your kid wants to by gaming supplies? You'll probably have heard of GameStop where as a new business doesn't have that luxury. The parent would probably google it to see if there is one nearby and, oh, it looks like there is an online site they can order from."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,But you realize those starts have capacity caps of like 20 people.  On top of that.  They didn't build them they rent them.   They would be better off starting with a best buy.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe. I was considering that the Majority of them that I've seen have been located in dying malls/strip malls. But yeah, it might be better if they buy/rent bigger locations."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Next week, WSB buys a crap load of land and actually builds a free zoo for the public. Then buys up a rainforest, and a Coral reef. MSM still reports them as scum of the earth. WSB gives no fucks and makes the world great again."

I saw this as nothing more than a wholesome weekend distraction to get us to Monday. We‚Äôve gotten good PR for WSB and GME with the charity organization tweeting out as well.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you so much for this post.  Very well done. 
 It's clear that a hearts and minds campaign is being fought to keep retail from realizing the collective power we have.  
Why?
 
 Why try to convince retail they are powerless when the statistics prove that's false? 
 
   This is the definition of a misinformation campaign.  If I can make you believe that collectively you have no power in the market. 
 Then individually you will squander that power."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm a school teacher who casually drops GME into my lessons because I find it humorous and I didn't actually expect kids to know what I'm talking about. And turns out, A TON OF THEM DID BECAUSE THEIR MILLIONAIRE PARENTS ARE INVESTING (I live in an affluent area that pays teachers shit). So I'm like hold up. If these rich assholes think this is a sound investment, I am doubling down."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Not giving numbers but we're a group of 12 gme holding friends I'm the only one on reddit. And some in the group hold close to a thousand shares.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"So just ballparking numbers, 50-100m US traders active recently, some Canadians, Mexico, South America, our Euro bros, our Asian allies, Oceania, Africa, this really is around the world. The potential population of GME buyers is above 140m. So to make this a short-squeeze, about 50% of them have to hold an average of 1 share? Well maybe that's true, but factor those numbers by 10, and you get this interesting question:

Across all of those populations, could there be a sub-population of about 5-7m traders with an average of 10 shares each that refuse to sell until above 1k? (-< or insert personal price target here). That's 3-5% of the potential buyers, just about the percentage we get from OP's numbers estimated from RobbingUsHood data.

But we can also factor by 10 once more: Could there be a further sub-population of about 500,000 retards with an average of 100 shares each? Because there is more of this sub-population being jacked to the tits and buying options than ever before, I think the answer to my question is (insert aliens_guy gif) .... yes

Edit: phrasing Lana"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess this supports the theory that all we retail traders have to do is hodl. Theres power in numbers. Apes together strong üíéüöÄ
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Finally some DD. If I see one more gorilla I'm gonna throw my phone into a brick wall as hard as I can
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Excellent DD! You changed my opinion of retail power.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hold, confirmed"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Many thanks for doing this. This was in the back of my head. ""Could retail be controlling all of the GME float?""  Your hard work helped me to stop obsessing about this.  Many many Thanks!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,THAT SHIT IS GENUS IT MAKES SENCE!!! IM HOLDING TO THE MOON !!!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great DD! I've been waiting for someone to come out with something like this for a while now. Retail keeps getting trashed as not influential, but if that were true, why the FUD from MSM? Why not just smile quietly and let the apes scream into the void? Apes together strong, is why. And they know it. They fear it.

My thoughts are significantly simpler, though based on the same idea. JUST counting WSB (for the sake of this example, I will round up to 10m members), if only 1/10th of the members have a stake in GME with an average of ten shares, that's 10m shares. If HALF the sub has a stake in GME at an average of 10 shares, that's 50m shares, or ~85% of the total float.

Every time I hear MSM bash retail, especially when it comes to GME, I laugh. They clearly have no idea how badly we all want this. We won't get bored. We won't lose interest. And I honestly wouldn't be surprised if retail alone accounted for 100%+ of the available float at this point. Time will tell, I suppose. I know I'm going to hold until the tendieman cometh. üöÄ

Power to the Player!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Retail has always mattered.  Splits and reverse splits are for optics.  The big companies hold events to get press, and CEOs spend more time doing PR than day-to-day managing.

Ignore propaganda that is inconsistent with all the above examples of why retail matters."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Excellent analysis. You stuck to the facts, but this also explains the unusually strong reactions from the brokerages, short sellers, pundits, reddit shills, and media in general. That is demonstrable and it clearly exposes how the machine works."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Add in everyone else outside America buying this up too!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm 100% sure that this DD is on point. The exact numbers we don't know, but with only the numbers (users over different brokers) from US, and seeing how much attention gamestop got internationally, (saw DD that only on one swedish broker are over 20k users holding GME) it's well possible that retail owns most of the complete flow.. Everybody needs to hold his shares tight, not day trading (I believe that they profit from trading, so they don't need to deliver the shares after setlement time) 

üöÄüöÄüöÄ"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Imo retail owns all the float. I'm at triple digits myself and I know several other folks that have been buying up like crazy and aren't even on Reddit like that
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Are we working together?  No.  Is this mass hysteria? Probably.  Does it have an impact?  Absolutely.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is imperative for the elite to keep this knowledge away from the people. Knowledge is power. Poverty and education are linked significantly.

You are so very right there. Thanks for the interesting data and DD.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I like your effort
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe retail owns 100 percent of available gme float
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,History tells us... because these same ideas happened back in the early 2000‚Äôs and though today I 100% agree with you we have power... the reality is the market is on a 10 year tear... as soon as we move into a bear market which will happen at some point we lose ALOT of power... almost all of it... and then it will take another long bull market for retail to get enough balls to take some power back...I said it in a post earlier... fear of losing money is why Wall Street will always have the power they have no fear and though some of us on this sub can match that the majority can‚Äôt... especially in a bear market...

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd really like a way to count to the number of shares owned by WSB. I think we very plausibly own the float. I'm wondering if we took a poll and validated the people holding 1k or more shares first where we would end up.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,If retail has no power than stimulus checks are useless.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it‚Äôs a little bit of a power trip from those in power to make us feel smaller, but I also think those in power are old money and don‚Äôt understand the modern age well enough. They can barely wrap their heads around what a ‚Äútweet‚Äù or ‚Äúviral video‚Äù is and generally aren‚Äôt aware or care to tune in to real social media mews. By the time some story from social media hits mainstream media, they have botched the message or don‚Äôt  clearly see the big picture paraphrasing everything as they report the news to the boomers. The ONLY real way to get in on the pulse of social media and the collective hive mind of retail trading is to literally be boots on the ground scrolling through hours of useless information and emoji blasting until you find an intelligent conversation for a few minutes and then are right back in to the void. Mainstream media still hasn‚Äôt understood this and will put the amount of effort they always have and check out a reddit site for like 3 mins, and then report back ‚Äúretail traders have no power they just spam emojis every day‚Äù and people believe them"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I‚Äôm not sure why people seem to think all of the GME crew is on Reddit. I‚Äôm the only one out of 9 people I know holding any amount of shares. 1 other lurks, don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs even part of the 9m following the sub."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Curious, how did they hear about GME? Was it through traditional news?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I may be misremembering but weren't there some numbers that stated what percentage of RH users owned GME at some point in the past?

I think I remember something stated like that and the number was quite high, I think even more than half the RH users."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Mine too. This is the kind of shit that gets people epsteined.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agree with both you and OP. The missing piece for retail is further knowledge and quality information (very few retail investors pay for Bloomberg Terminal and have professional training in investing). I‚Äôm not sure about the knowledge, but there‚Äôs certainly a push towards making quality information free or affordable for regular people. Once we level this field, the game will change again. And can you imagine if everyone could deploy their own algos as easily as it is to buy groceries online?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just like moments before the Great Depression - we're staring at retail's biggest market presence in a long while. Perhaps the markets crash when ever there's enough ""regular"" people doing trades. Just to keep them in check and fearful enough to doubt themselves."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I think people that control the market are waiting for retail to get to certain percentage of investment before they pull their money. Then you just wait the crash out a little and buy at a deep discount from all the üßª ‚úã.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I doubt it, we did have a recession this past year and retail have been doing great. Partly thanks to sharing info with one another and retail finally figuring out CNBS‚Äôs role as hf pets"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I think this is a great idea once it‚Äôs time to take tendies elsewhere.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt think 9.5m is the true number of people here. 

spez said in an interview that back in Jan when gme was rising this sub had more than 57 million viewers which essentially caused that crash we all remember. I think a majority of people here are just lurkers and it‚Äôll be quite naive to think that 9.5m is the max number of people on this sub.

Let's be really conservative and assume 1 million of the subscribers are American people that get a stimulus check. That's, 1.4 billion in free dollars that could be going to GME. 

Ok maybe not every American that is a subscriber here that gets a stimmy check will spend the whole stimmy  on the stock market or on GME specifically, but still it's probably going to be hundreds of millions of dollars that could flow to GME in the next few days. That's pretty significant. And that's just the free stimulus money."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,And how many of them actually invest?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is from years ago but  at some point something like 10% of people who view reddit regularly have accounts and of those only about 10% comment with any regularity.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"True but maybe we should still stick to the real numbers, if there is more, great but always assume data is all you have."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Whatever. The data is skewed because of the number of people with $2m accounts is drastically outnumbered by the number of people with $17.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The best comparison I can make to mainstream media reporting on retail trading would be mainstream game reviewers like IGN or metacritic reviewing the latest games published. They will literally play like 10 minutes of each level/world and write an entire game review because they have to write another review for a different game by the end of the week. Both reviewers have no clue what is truly going on.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt understand why everyone is debating the amount of WSB users, I didn‚Äôt use that info in my debate at all because there‚Äôs no way to measure. Between bots, inactive accounts, lurkers, observers, etc. it‚Äôs wild guess, so I chose not to use that info for anything."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,But that‚Äôs how averages work. Yeah 3 people might own .2 shares cause they‚Äôre broke but then the guy with 1m in his account might own 1k shares. That‚Äôs the point of an average.

And get this, I can't set a sell limit order higher than $10k nor can I make a single sell over $10k. So if GME really blasts off i'll have to be selling fractionals 10k at a time."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Chuckles is right here, it's true the average is not a measure of the *characteristic* number of shares held by your typical retail-tard, but finding the average helps us estimate the total number held, and it is indeed skewed high, which is good!

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What app are you using that doesn't allow you to trade over $10k at a time? Is this the same for others services in the UK? I use Freetrade

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man, i hope so. I mean, it allows me to choose what i'm selling - shares or money amounts, so theoretically if 1 share is >10k it has to fill the order.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Not only this but if you add up all the institutional ownership(>100%) and insiders(27%). It seems to be safe to assume the entire real float is already bought up and continuing to rise. Great work btw thanks

IMO, people are way too fixated on a quick and massive squeeze. They believe that high short numbers are the only indicator for a bullish market. It's not that simple. There are quite a few factors though that hint to AMC being under valued as it is now. You never know how the pandemic will turn out in the next months. But the direction it's heading now leads me to a very optimistic view on AMC."

There are already a large amount of shares outstanding and now they want to more than double it after diluting the stock a hefty amount during covid already. Somehow people interpreted this bad news as some kind of genious plot to recount in order to ""find the fake shares"". Also, short-mid term, I believe the stock will rise in anticipation of reopening and pent up demand but when that is gone I expect it to go down again. They diluted it so much in order to free up capital and keep from going bankrupt I really doubt a squeeze is happening. However, feel free to prove me wrong or argue against me.

Rah, rah, but guess what -- they definitely will need to do the dilution, and soon.  They're buried in debt.  The kind of debt they can NEVER pay down with revenues.  Don't underestimate how painfully expensive the interest payments are (it's far, far worse than what WSB thinks shorts are paying all the time).  They simply need to get capital by issuing shares.  They'd never seek this big an authorized number if they didn't intend to use a big, big slice of it.  Maybe not all at once, but they'll want to move to sell when prices are higher than intrinsic value, for sure.

Oh, and everyone seems to think that institutions holding shares are going to keep holding as long as apes do.  That's flat wrong.  They're going to dump them and take massive profits as soon as they see a glimmer that the party is stalling.  They're not HODL, they're looking for return and it seems likely to me that many of them will sell into what feels like the top of any stimulus buying wave.  Those numbers in institutional hands are huge.  So folks should be mindful that when the institutions unload, retail investors will be holding bags and bags."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Now this is DD I can get behind üíØ keep up the good work üôèüèΩ
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Why did this get removed the first time?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you. I really do enjoy the process of breaking things down.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha yeah, ARKF is pretty good since the space does demand innovation."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Np! I'm trying to build an audience over time with analysis. I do love writing and breaking things down.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What am I promoting? I can just edit that part out. Wasn't aware.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Well hopefully next time it's amazing! Thanks for taking the time to read it.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Np!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Np. Plenty more to come.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you!!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because I said ""org"" with an s at the end, which is a banned ticker. I meant to abbreviate ""organization"""
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can resubmit but remove anything asking for or telling people to follow.

As mods we tend to clamp down on anything of the sort very quickly. Others often issue temp bans.

Also, careful with anything crypto. Idk enough about your dd to decide but other mod might give it the axe and a ban if it has crypto."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The RIOT ticker, any thoughts?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Is the post deleted?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,If you want to edit and put this back up then ping me when ready. Doing that is likely to kill momentum so it's honestly better for the post and visibility if you resubmit.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Removed from the feed so no one can see unless they left a comment or something. I snipe anything telling people to follow stuff.

There were community reports stacking up already."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"We can try. If the post dies out, Ill just resubmit when I'm home where I can use the image drop-down editor."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I removed it. Do I have to repost it? Because it would be my third time reposting it... Random rules keep auto deleting it like typing ""orgs"" short for ""organizations"" :/ :'("
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I put it back up.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you. I appreciate the leniency. I'll review the rules since I plan to post DD regularly.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I try to at least be transparent on high quality posts where I take a mod action. If you post a three sentence DD telling people to follow it will get nuked from orbit without a comment.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love you both. This exchange is how moderation should be done. Through education not sole punishment. Our little reddit-wide powermod cabal could listen and learn. There's also a thing called ""guidelines to moderating healthy communities"" in the site wide rules. It *is* guidelines, but it should mean more than just that."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,love u
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah truthfully I took a risk with b*tcoin, given that it's a legitimate subject matter in the context of banking and neobanking. I guess it's important to remember that mods are actually people and certain sections of their forums are well maintained, the DD flair section being one of them.

I added a disclaimer."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I mentioned in our mod chat that I was tailing the next semi-literate DD that didn‚Äôt mention short interest. Looks like I‚Äôm going bull on TUI on Monday
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I do like your DD but investing in companies like this is a no for me. The fact that the current pandemic will decide if they even have a future makes it too risky
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Control-F'd the post and didn't find a single mention of debt. Solid.

They are 7.5B‚Ç¨ in debt. Remember that before investing please. I made a quick play when they went from 2‚Ç¨ to 4‚Ç¨ and then got the hell out. They're pretty much running on boomer hopium."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Better wait until the 25. March for the next general meeting. TUI already needed 4.3 billion Euro by the German government and they might need more.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I'm also waiting to move in there, but with the obvious 3. pandemic wave incoming, I'll wait for some weeks...."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hi, they are loosing market share to online bookings where by people book directly with airlines and the hotel, and also Expedia etc. You‚Äôre probably too young to remember a time when you had to walk into a travel agent to see where, when and how much flights and hotels were. The shift to ‚Äúdo it yourself‚Äù online is one way and permanent. 

On top of that, sites like Airbnb are obviously huge and growing. That‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs going. The people that booked these holidays simply book in other ways now. I live in a country where Tui operate, I wouldn‚Äôt touch them.

Nice DD tho, if you do take the plunge, I hope it goes great for you."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you considered effects of January rights issue?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Travel agency? Yikkessss
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"risky, look what happened to Thomas Cook in the uk just recently"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,">I don't know how Israel has 106% of its population vaccinated, but Germany is sitting below the European average at 10%, and our curve really does not look all that exponential.

People get 2 doses. Israel has \~45% of people double vaccinated. So when you see here 200 100% of people should be done."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Do they trade on US exchanges?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Food for thought. Do they do travel bookings for corporations? If so, what companies? also if so, are they part of a bigger enterprise focus like concur?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Not many people would consider me semi-literate... im honored!!!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,">  the next semi-literate DD that didn‚Äôt mention short interest.

I'll drink to that. Every post seems to mention that and ""potential squeeze"" like it's some magic fucking words that will just print money.     
    
Finding stocks that haven't recovered from their pre-covid prices is good but I don't know enough about people's attitudes in the EU to know where a company like this stands (I know a lot of people in the US are in a *we're fucking tired of this shit* mindset and basically said ""Fuck you"" when potus said we *might* be able to meet in small groups by July.) If EU/Germans are more sheepish about a return to normal, there may still be time for this price to continue dipping."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I understand that it's extremely risky, but how likely do you really think it is that there will be a covid mutation so our vaccines are useless? Otherwise the company will most likely survive, so if the risk of mutation is anywhere below 10-20%, the potential reward of the gains still outweigh the 10-20% chance of bankruptcy.

&#x200B;

Obviously this would exclude a YOLO with all of your life savings... who wants to have a 20% chance of losing their life savings."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Since when do people on wallstreetbets car about risk? You will buy and hodl or ban.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"As i said, im looking for people to bring up flaws in my analysis. This is my first DD, and i didnt expect it to be perfect... If it falls below 4‚Ç¨ again ill still go for it on a 2-4 year play, but your comment probably reduced my investment amount :D Thanks for sharing, ill investigate that tomorrow."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah like i said i want it to fall down to its floor one more time. :) Happy if it falls below, but im buying some at 3.75‚Ç¨!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah with the few vaccinations going on i think 5‚Ç¨ is a big pricey, but below 4 ill be happier again."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the input! Really appreciate it. :) When I think about the tui business i mostly think about the website, though. They have many of the pre planned trips, but ive never been on one myself and plan all my vacations myself, yet i can still use their website because it works similar to, for example, expedia. Also i think their own hotels and airline gives them an advantage against these other companies.


I agree though that in 20 years we won't have any significant number of physical travel agencies, and do understand why its weird that id still like to invest into this. My timeline only goes until maybs 3-4 years from now though, if that explains."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Could you elaborate?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,How is that a problem?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah i figured it was like this, but it just left me more unhappy with Germany effectively being at 5%, so I didnt want to think about it. üòÇ"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Theyve been a big player since 1999.. i assume they do. But i dont, so youll have to check for yourself :)"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The bar is low
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It looks like Germany is about to lock back down again. The vaccine rollout there is also horrendously bad. That said, this is probably a good shares play (Schwab has the stock, but no options chain, so I guess I was doing shares anyway)."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"A 20% chance to lose everything for a 2x increase potential in a few years?

It seems pretty risky even without considering many other variables like another airplane crash or a new variant that closes everything again.

Contrary to your assertion, I believe that the government could absolutely let it crumble even though they bailed them out once. 

I also do not believe that ‚Äúmany Germans are saving for vacation‚Äù. Many Germans are trying to keep their head above water and recover form the economic hit we all took. I do not see everyone splurging on vacations since they missed out on a years worth, but that‚Äôs just me.

It‚Äôs a tough call but with the way the economy is going, I‚Äôm not biting on this one. 

Good luck if you do and I wish you all the tendies if you gamble on it."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Their vertical integration used to give them savings, but these have been significantly eroded by cheap competitors. Their main market is family holidays (that I take), but it‚Äôs so much nicer to use air bnb than multiple hotel rooms. Over here, their style of offering is called a package holiday, which is on its way out. I have serious concerns about their legacy debt too. They will also still have to honour plenty of canceled bookings from 2020 which will be costly.

That‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs not a good time now to buy, and that there isn‚Äôt money to be made. You made several solid cases for it. When everybody else thinks it stinks is sometimes the right time to have a look. Nobody has a crystal ball. The holiday sector will come back with a bang. Plenty of families will double up on holidays in this year and next, with the money they saved in 2020. If it‚Äôs ticking boxes for you, roll the dice with it. Yes may or may not make money, but you will learn plenty."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"TUI issued new shares in January 29:25 for current holders which, I guess, diluted the price somewhat?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most people, in America at least, purchase vacations √° la cart, meaning they buy each part individually. Airline tickets from Hotwire, hotel from Expedia, car from enterprise. 

Is it different in Germany?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,TUIFF
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah if a mod throws some money at something _the author of the DD isnt even buying yet_ you know youre in the right sub!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the kind of criticism im looking for!
With the biggest risk being bankruptcy i'd go for long term options anyway, so the upside would be much larger than 2x, but i definitely understand that a 20% chance of losing everything is too big for most people. Im happy to take the extra risk for the extra risk premium though. :)

Also, how Germans will go back to travelling is of course very speculative. I think im right, but i understand if you end up being right, which is why im going for long term options. :)"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have done an excellent job at wasting my time.


*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"don‚Äôt quote me on this, but while many people book everything separately here as well, there‚Äôs also a good number of people that still book through agencies. Especially a) older people, b) people booking last minute (cheap and easy), c) those wanting to travel around and not just to one place (way more convenient if you miss your connection somewhere to have booked all in the same place) and d)groups."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dont judge others by your own standarts! I love to go on vacations very spontaneously without planning much, but others dont and the business model has worked forever."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a boomer thing. My mother still uses them for all of her traveling.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,That's too complicated for boomers. A lot of people prefer to book all inclusive with a travel agency. They are willing to pay a lot more for the 'convenience' of having everything pre-arranged.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you‚Äôre playing options, yes, but you‚Äôre still running a risk. 

There are just so many variables right now that it would drive me mad trying to watch every corner of this business to properly bet either way.

Also, with options, I‚Äôd say your chances are far more than 20%. 

This is definitely a roulette wheel play. So it fits:)

Good luck you retard. If you‚Äôre right, send me a box of crayons to eat while I drool on my screen from your gain porn.

If you‚Äôre wrong, I‚Äôll send you one to eat while you cry posting your loss porn."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the Germans are half as enthousiastic as the Dutch about going away, it should be fine. But their solvability is pretty bad, and their pre-pandemic profits were not that great either. I'd say there are better companies in the same boat to invest in"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now I'm gonna quote you. 

You missed corporate bookings. Most companies with large travel budgets enforce the use of a partner travel agent."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It actually hasn‚Äôt. Travel agencies are a dying industry.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah im a bit unhappy with the profits being cut by 50% from 2018 to 2019 but i do think theres market share to eat up after thomas cook went belly up. I think TUI is one of the safer horses because its so big and others might go bankrupt sooner, but care to elaborate on those other firms?

Currently im hodling norwegian cruise line holdings because i believe we'll get cruises for vaccinated people before we get international travel."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd be inclined to know your reasoning. Tui for example went from 2.30‚Ç¨ at one point in 2011 to 12‚Ç¨ right before Covid. How does this imply a strong decline even if they survive corona and people can travel again?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dutch royal airlines - air france has terrible results, but the Dutch state is all-in too, so they will make it through the pandemic. 

Inbev could be great as soon as Europe opens up and bars are serving beer again."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You clearly don‚Äôt care what I say. I literally said people don‚Äôt use travel agencies in America and in America they are dying off. Is it different in Germany?

Go ahead and get those tendies with a German travel agency. I‚Äôll pass."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The largest american travel shopping company appears to be the expedia group, and is currently at an all time high (even in the pandemic). I'm listening, i'm just not sure where your arguments are coming from.

&#x200B;

Of course you can find hotels and book your own vacations through their websites without booking a pre-booked trip, but its the same with tui."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I haven't used a travel agency unless i'm outside of US.

I think travel agencies are safer when booking overseas travel whereas in the US most people are flying interstate or an easy trip to EU which is booked easily alone mostly visa free.

Most Countries that don't have 50 states in their back yard so they would be flying into a foreign country and will probably need visas, and tours/ hotels booked in advance with travel insurance and guarantees.

&#x200B;

What the fuck am I saying? I do not know."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"
I like Rocket Labs, at least they have flights."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôve been spamming Reddit with this stock for 2 weeks. I think you may be a bag holder trying to get out from under a bad trade.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What about Chamath selling?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This will go to the moon unless Leo and Diamond hands Rih Rih blow up , and becomes fish food. That‚Äôs kind of the fun of this one you can either make a lot of money or watch billionaires explode on live tv."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Chamath pulled out 100% of his personal stake in the company. You can believe him when he says it‚Äôs to ‚Äúfree up cash for other ventures‚Äù or you can make the logical conclusion that he doesn‚Äôt like the future outlook and is selling at profit. 

The fact George Whitesides first stepped down as CEO and is now stepping down as CSO is also a terrible look. When virgin has delayed their launch twice, pushed commercial flights back to 2022, the chairman of the board sells his entire stake, and the CEO is dashing for the door that should be a pretty huge red flag.

Im sure I‚Äôll be downvoted but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact there‚Äôs 0 DD in any of these SPCE posts. Just objectively speaking where is the value? Why does anyone think this deserves to go back to $50 when they can‚Äôt even get a rocket in the air for a test flight?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the May window will not be succesfull the company s gonna go even lower, also every succesfull test flight of SpaceX's low orbital tests is a nail to the coffin of SPCE. I do hope the May event will go as planned."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I got in at SPCE last year at around $17. I'll üíé ‚úã but probably won't top up my bags.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,looking juicy ngl lol might just have to place a call...
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got into SPCE at $24 and sold at $55, but this is making me tempted to rejoin"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This feels a little to high spec for me. Need some event far in the future to happen then pass. There are other opportunities. Then I heard chamath sold.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you think everything hinges on the May launch, maybe a straddle is the best option?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed I've filled up my bags with Rocket Labs and Momentus
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought this looked familiar.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The redditbros / Elon fans over at r/spacex who actually understand rocket science thinks Virgin Galactic is mostly hype and not much substance, yep.

Also wanted to add that SPCE actually has competition coming:  About 150 miles to the southwest of Spaceport America in Van Horn TX, the Bald Supervillain who runs Amazon (affectionately known as ""Jeff who?"" to r/spacex redditbros) is preparing to fly space tourists using Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket and capsule.  https://spacenews.com/blue-origin-launches-new-shepard-vehicle-intended-for-crewed-flights/

This is the direct competitor to Virgin Galactic in the suborbital tourist joyride market."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the biggest red flag. Bulls like to say he has many shares left but they are held in a trust he can‚Äôt access. 

He liquidated his ENTIRE personal position as the fucking chairman. I wouldn‚Äôt touch any company that did that."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"only get in for a quick swing trade, which is risky anyways. They have had 2 failed flights launches keep getting delayed, Chamath and chairman of the board selling all their shares, low optimism."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,">	I called $DIS 6 months ago when it was hovering around $125 and y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt listen.

I just want to say every stonk went up during the last 6 months. You could have picked any piece of turd back then and it would be worth a huge pile of shit by now."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahah ""it's literally free money"". A value of $87bn makes it the second largest company in South Korea. It is wildly over valued and operates in one single market of 51m people. How exactly are they achieving a $500bn valuation just serving the Korean market? That is the same market cap as Samsung which operates globally and has a multitude of different products. People pumping CPNG at the current valuation are out of their tree."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"i buy it below 25, not at this insane price for today."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape like!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in take my money
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like the background information and using simple common sense, it makes a lot of sense. I think 45$/s is pretty high for me right now to commit to but I‚Äôm going to watch it next week and see what happens. 

Appreciate the effort."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Sweet DD thank you. I read it on the pot. Later I will read it off the pot.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great DD, definitely worth looking into. What are your positions?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Why does everyone act like it‚Äôs a Korean company. Their founder is from the USA as are most of their board members. The only Korean connection is the founder is Korean American and they have a share of market in Korea. Even have their HQ in the US. This isn‚Äôt the Amazon of Korea. It‚Äôs a US business that couldn‚Äôt get market share here but found some in Korea.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck.. i Wish i had more Money to invest lol... I Will buy some shares when i Will free some Money! Korea Is so advanced with e-commerce. We have to ask some korean guy of they also have Amazon there and how they much they use them and Coupang.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,On that note: I feel jumia has more upside potential. The market cap is relatively low
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dunno about that one, chief. 

They had a TERRIBLE start on IPO. 

They are still in enormous debt. 

Their local competitors are gaining on them 

They obviously don‚Äôt have enough momentum to attract investors, especially Americans who, generally, are very sceptical of investing into the foreign companies."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I've got some at $49. My only concern is that South Korea is small even though it has a population of 51mil. It's only one country. How big can they really grow?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,A third world Japanese colony? If any Korean saw this you'd be $ROPED by them.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The reason I wasn‚Äôt in is because I saw this posted on another forum. The downside is the debt. And Korea has many competitors. There is no brand loyalty between them the way Amazon has. There is fierce price competition between them.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"South korea has terrible demographics, so unless they expand outside of the sk market, long term it won't be able to grow much"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I saw another post about this in r/stocks now let me just say this I'll be buying shares come Monday morning premarket, however their was alot of people saying don't think the is a 5x stock anytime soon or ever. The top comment was also a korean who said their culture isn't like america in terms of they flop on companies with no loyalty. Here if your nike your nike there it's what do I feel like today"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy PUTs
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good DD - will definitely invest in this.

Because it‚Äôs not an American company will it get the same treatment as Chinese companies which are undervalued- see BABA??"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve already got a lot of exposure to Asian ecommerce.  How do you feel something like this compares to a stock like JD?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I promise I'll adopt a gorilla when this prints for me üíØüíØ
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thoughts on Naver and EMart recent teaming up to combat Coupang?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just placed an order, this makes me feel better. I was worried a little about how it was offered at 35 then went from 65 to 48, full disclosure I am relatively uneducated and pretty much winging it after being poor for a stretch. A really long stretch. But, I know logistics and having a huge population concentrated like it is in Korea has got to be a delivery goldmine."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I listened
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,My retirement!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice work.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been thinking about buying some for the past week, Thanks for some good DD."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I understand, tomorrow I will ride with c pang gang."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a great company. Long term slam dunk, key words are long term. In the near term, it‚Äôs overvalued and you will get a far better price as people take profit on the ipo pop, if you are planning on holding for years, the price now is fine."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Coupang should come to the USA and give Amazon some competition.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,So you are balls deep in this Korean Jesus and try to sell it here. Why do we need this when we have GME BB and AMC?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah DIS was an obvious play. 

If he picked something like VIAC then he gets respect."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I only got 1 like on that post. Hindsight is 20/20. I specified my reasons for why $DIS was gonna go up and it's at ATH and it will continue to climb. You call it luck, I call it hard work"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I stated that my thesis is dependent on them innovating and introducing a high margin product or service. That's how they will get to $500B. And Samsung will get close to being a $1T company. Inflation's a big factor but they're also a global leader. Trillion dollar companies are the new billion dollar companies
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Get this guy outta here it‚Äôll never be 25
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I got a few shares around $50. Will continue to add under this price
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean 24% market share of South Korean e-commerce??
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,No amazon here. Coupang has been huge during the pandemic.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Coupang became largest online retailer last year over Amazon in Korea. Local companies understand culture better thus the success.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,JMIA doesn‚Äôt have sales growth like this. I like the stock but they have more obstacles to overcome
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great companies don‚Äôt need to have great price action on IPO day. They‚Äôre still up huge from IPO price so they actually did well

Who‚Äôs gaining on them? They went from 18% market share to 24%

It‚Äôs been a couple days man. Just wait lol"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"11th largest economy in the world. 7th largest e-commerce. E-commerce expected to become 3rd largest in the world in 5 years. What about 10 years, 20 years?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"18% to 24% market share in a year.

Debts not a concern as long as they can increase revenue ($6B to $12B in one year)"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,SK is one of the most innovative countries in the world. They will find a way
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,My man
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I like it more. South Korea is so much easier to serve compared to China. Everyone lives in Seoul. Less investment needed for infrastructure. Less fuel need for delivery. Potential same-day delivery for 70% of South Koreans. Lots of advantages compared to JD
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruh lol. Not everyone wants to YOLO into meme stocks
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,In that case congrats on your hard work paying off.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,So you are saying the inflation makes cpng worth $500bil in future? This is some quality retardness I look for from this sub
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,So buy Samsung then?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"says the guy to buy at this price cuz at 2024 will be worth, get your ass out of here, this is wsb not /investing, we dont wait 3 years"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok thanks, question Is how many koreans invest in the market? I think a lot and would you ever invest in CPNG? Young koreans got a lot of crazy Money"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh nice. So this Will have a market cap bigger than baba? 
I think its undervalued but still there's not too much upside in the short term but if i see a good dip i Will enter."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't know, but don't understand where can they grow, since I don't think they can expand internationally. South Korea has borders. Coupang stops at these borders."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Growth in revenue from 6b to 12b as an ecommerce/delivery service isnt that crazy to think of considering the pandemic, right? I wouldn't be surprised if their growth dramaticly slows down once things go back to normal"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I understand but my smooth brain can only count to three. Now everyone posting DDs of other companies and I start to panic that I miss another squeeze or flying stock. Sorry probably I was too rude in my previous comment. Good DD, respect."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm sure it was good DD but people here want tendies now not over the course of 1 year.

I‚Äôve been in Disney before they bought Starwars. 
I like the stock."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Never said it will be bigger than $BABA. But it's easier to get from $87B market cap to $500B than to go from $630B to $3T. Money will double faster with $CPNG IMO
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't either, but what I'm saying is even with just the dominance in South Korea they will be a multi-bagger. I don't think you understand what it means to dominate a tech-focused highly productive country like South Korea"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol yeah I know. This isn‚Äôt a get rich now scheme. But this is a buy-and-hold winner. I just feel like we‚Äôre gonna have a bunch of trillion dollar companies in the future and $CPNG has chance to become one. Inflation man smh
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ofc, i would rather buy CPNG instead of baba or amzn. I see this more of a long term investment which could triple easily."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. I absolutely don't. I'd love to learn, but google-fu is a disappointment. Anyway, I'll buy more shares Monday if the price keeps dropping, lol."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The two patterns are different.  March 2020 had been making higher highs and higher lows. This March we are making lower highs and lower lows. It looks like the Vix wants to go lower.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is without a doubt the worst DD I have ever seen. I'll drink piss or ban if ""a market crash occurs in the next few days or week."""
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You mean there is a new pandemic ?

Damn vix knows all!

On a serious note, I'm 50% cash baby .. So I'm waiting .. I have a healthy shopping list!

Also, these don't look like similar patterns at all ..."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wonder if there was some event that helped cause march. Meh, oh well."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Boomer logic says to expect a move towards ‚Äòcommodities‚Äô and ‚Äòcyclicals‚Äô and to expect the beatings to be severe in tech.  Of course I don‚Äôt expect many on here to listen to boomer logic.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here, and here, and there, and, oh, over here too! Seems like volatility is afoot."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also, (and this fits well with your technicals) next week one day is the 17th which has a seven. The crash started in 2007 which also has a seven."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I happen to see that same pattern in a few spots. Didn‚Äôt read anything after I noticed that. Good talk!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Jist put it in GME as a hedge against economy collapse. Simple.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,How the fuck is this allowed to be dd?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,A market crash/correction would be great for GME cuz that's exactly what happened during the last squeeze - it's becuase funds have to liquidate other positions to cover GME and becuase GME benefits greatly from volatility
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"4/16 UVXY $10 call and 6/18 UVXY $270 call checking in for duty sir. 

GME and other squeezes could cause market sell off on margin calls. I have already taken the trade myself and plan to add to it this week. 

Not financial advice."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,We're definitely going to have some market corrections but it's not going to be like 2020 crash. A lot of people pulled out of the market because of the uncertainties with Covid-19.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt think you needed the ‚Äòfinancial advice‚Äô disclaimer. It‚Äôs pretty obvious.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"After reading comments --  we're all in agreement,  it could go up, or potentially go down?  :-)  the upside potential seems higher, and the downside risk lower, i might just take a healthy jump on uvxy, more than I already have after friday (disclosure)..  good luck guys/gals...."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Can somebody explain the specific reasons why gme and other meme stocks might moon in a general crash? Would the shorts have to unload their positions and move into cash or safer stuff?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I see that lil camel  payyern all over the other side.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm confused. Aren't the catalyst for a crash completely different this time? Or are you merely saying they will crash the market on purpose and blame externalities?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It was looking sketchy but Vix got beat down badly on Friday.  I think Vix probably gap fills from here before the next spike.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This means buy more GME
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not going to lie I wrote this off the second I saw the word ""hedgies"" and wording that basically said scare you into selling your gme"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The March crash was directly from COVID there is no reason to believe VIX activity would signal another crash like that
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,So are we just buying stuff whenever we see Batman ears or is there more going on?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"is vix something I can go long in buying shares or is it a fast decay play that needs to be in and out? im truly dumb af, looking for splashy water plays after gme."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Market Daily momentum just now crossing into the green. Vix is about to get annihilated
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed.    This is a week+ t0o early. I see the vix going <20 next week.  Spy to 400 next week and maybe to 420 in the next few weeks.  After a week+?  I expect a rug pull either late March to sometime in April.  That way everyone spent their stimmies at the top
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,!remind me 5 days
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Gorillavid-19
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,super safe to play both sides.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Commodities went up so much already .. we already rotated to cyclicals, energy and financials went up so much this year, tech is lagging .. You are talking about old news .."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's no guarantee the same would happen, tho I think it's likely. What could change and cause a different outcome?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh wow that‚Äôs an interesting assumption. So you think there is LESS money in the market now, than pre-covid?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You forgot sideways.  Why does everyone always forget sideways?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The idea being that gamestop (and others) is considered a ""small"" part of their portfolios. But when that ""small"" part is blowing the fuck up, and your rent is due so you can't dump your paycheck into your account to cover your new found gamestop bills... Well you might start selling stuff you haven't turned a profit on, and maybe even stuff you've lost some small amounts in. But when those losses are in the 2-10% range, it sure beats keeping something that's looking like it'll hit -100%"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its just an index that measures volatility in the market, basically if it increases then there is a market sell off.."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes I was thinking the exact same thing but, that being said, if it goes straight up that wouldn‚Äôt surprise me at all."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, nailed it. There‚Äôs no way they would let people get more for their money with a crash right at stimulus + tax return time. It‚Äôs a lot more likely they‚Äôll make people buy at the top and be scared into selling after that."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems like he just wants an excuse to enjoy some piss!

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"And yet it will happen again.  Then it will unwind and happen again.  

This market has so much excess (and glorious) capital sloshing around that everything just moves faster."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Most of the money is probably back but a lot of people pulled it out when the March 2020 crash happen because of uncertainty.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"So true, in the current market, we've all forgotten sideways.  welcome to 2021, not much trades flat anymore.  thankfully, volatility is our friend...."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Sideways is the most dreaded.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea either can happen. I personally am more positioned for it to happen after next week. But either way I am fine because 70% of my money is in GME.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Spy puts are a hedge against the market. So they‚Äôre essentially doing the same thing as the GME shares.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty much. When GME does it's big rallies the rest of the stocks go red.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Problem with Chinese companies is communication and service. I listened to earning calls couple months ago, but didnt understand a word. Investors where asking questions a Chinese women was translating half Chinese half English.

I bought a Chinese ebike for ‚Ç¨1450 on geekbuy after 1 month i had problems. I send them an e-mail nobody was answering. At then end i watched some video's to fix it self. Now 6 months later bike is noisy it falls apart. And this was one of the most expensive bike what they where selling. It was special for the Europese market and they had a distribution centre in Spain and Poland.

My other bike is Trek i'm thinking to buy electric bike conversion kit and to build my own ebike."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly how?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Indidnt even know about Ebikes from China that cost that much. I've seen kits for under $600 tho
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Keep in mind Rolls Royce massively diluted shareholders last year in order to raise cash.

If things in the air travel industry come back to even 50% of where they were in 2019 by the end of the year they'll be in a good position to recover to a net-cash position within a year or two. They're only banking on 45% recovery, if I read it right.

2021-03-14 19:00:09,wallstreetbets,"I explain things to idiots, part 2: Puts, and a couple clarifications about Calls. Yesterday I made a post explaining calls, which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4a87a/i_teach_high_school_which_means_i_explain_things/).  In it, I said I'd explain puts later.  It's later, so I'm explaining them below.  I also had a lot of people ask me further questions about selling calls, so after I talk about puts, I'm going to cover some of that info to clear up confusion.  Assuming this goes as well as the last one, maybe I'll do one more post about options, in which I'll talk about writing calls/puts, and maybe go into a little more detail about the Greeks and how options are priced and valued.  We'll see. 

Moving forward, if you didn't read yesterday's post, then the first thing you should do is read that, because I'm going to use terminology and refer to concepts that were explained in that post.

**WHAT IS A PUT OPTION**

If a call is a bet that that a stock is going to go up, then a put option (hereafter referred to as a ""put"") is a bet that a stock is going to go down.  Like a call, a put is contract involving 100 shares.  However, instead of giving you the ability to buy 100 shares of stock at the strike price, a put option gives you the ability to sell 100 shares of stock at the strike price.

Example:  Let's say that GME is trading at $300, and you think it is going to tank.  You can buy a put option for $100, and if the price of GME drops below $100, you're ITM.

**HOW DO PUTS WORK?**

The same way as calls.  You buy them the same way, you pay for them the same way (premiums), you sell them the same way if you don't want to exercise (more on this later, as selling your contracts was the most common question I got yesterday), and they are impacted by theta decay and IV the same way.

One key difference is the exercising of a put option, which we'll look at in a second.  Other than that, there isn't much more to put here.  If you understand calls, then you understand puts.  Beyond exercising, the only real difference is that you are betting on the price to go down instead of up.

**CAN YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE ANYWAY?  I WAS LYING WHEN I SAID I UNDERSTOOD CALLS.**

Sure.

Let's say that GME is trading at $300, and you think the the hedgies are winning and the squeeze is over.  Or maybe you think that the squeeze is going to squoze next week, and after that the price is going to drop once everyone takes their profits.  Regardless, by 3/26, you think that the price will drop back down to $40 or lower.

So you buy an $8.32 GME 100p 3/26.  Do we remember what that means and how much it costs?  It means you spent $832 for the right to sell 100 shares of GME for $100 on or before 3/26.

Now you wait.  If 3/26 comes and goes and the price never drops, then your option expires OTM.

But if you were correct and the price does drop below $100, then you are ITM and have a choice to make.  You can sell the contract or exercise it.

**OK, SO HOW IS EXERCISING A PUT DIFFERENT THAN EXERCISING A CALL**

If you choose to exercise a call, you have one option: buy the shares.  When exercising a put, you have three options.

1.  If you already have 100 shares of GME (maybe you missed the peak and are holding a bag), then exercising the put is as easy as making the option writer buy your shares.  You give them 100 shares of GME, and they give you $10,000 ($100/share x 100 shares).  

2.  If you don't have 100 shares of GME, then you can buy 100 shares for whatever the stock price is (if it dropped all the way to $40, then you'd buy them for $40) and then sell them to the option writer for $100 share.  That's dumb.  Don't do that.

3.  If you think it has farther to fall (and you have a margin account), you can enter a short position.  You borrow 100 shares and sell them to the option writer for $100, then you wait and buy them back later to replace the shares you borrowed.  That's big dumb.  Don't do that either.

Really, though, you should be selling your contracts instead of exercising, because exercising contracts throws away any extrinsic value you may have built (see below).  Plus, you probably don't want and can't afford 100 shares of whatever stock you have options on.

**THE PART WHERE I TALK ABOUT SELLING YOUR OPTION CONTRACTS AND ANSWER SOME COMMON QUESTIONS AND HOPEFULLY DO A BETTER JOB THAN LAST TIME.  I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT PUTS AND CALLS BOTH HERE.**

*First, let's talk about value and taking advantage of that value to sell for profit.*

We talked about this a little yesterday, but you need to make sure you understand that your option has value from when you buy it until it expires, and that you can use that value to make money.  Does that mean it has value even when it's OTM?  Yes, even OTM options have value (see: extrinsic value from yesterday).  Why?  Because people buy OTM contracts.  In fact, OTM contracts can even make you money while still OTM.  Did you buy a $400c when the stock price was $100?  If the stock price gets to $350, you may be OTM, but your $400c contract can be worth more now than it was when you bought it (assuming there is time left before expiration and theta isn't killing you).  But how can you buy an OTM contract and then sell that same contract for profit when it is still OTM?  Remember the premiums.  When people buy options, they pay the option seller a premium to buy that contract.  The premium on a way OTM contract is going to be very cheap.  The premium on a ""near the money"" contract that is that has time to spare is going to be higher.  If you buy that contract when it is way OTM and sell it when it is near the money, the price the buyer gives you could be higher than the price you paid to the seller, which equals profit.  The same is true of a put.  If you buy a $100p when the share price is $400, you'll be able to sell that contract for a profit if the price drops to $150 (again, assuming you aren't running out of time.  Time is a big deal.  Seriously.  I'll talk about that later).

On the other hand, an OTM option that is running out of time and not even close to strike (or hasn't move appreciably since bought) isn't going to have as much value as it did when you bought, and any sale would be at a loss.  But remember that you can still sell it even if it is losing.

ITM options always have value because they are worth the difference between the stock price and strike (remember intrinsic value?), which can't be zero if the stock is trading above strike.

*So when can I sell my contract?*

Anytime.  You can sell it ITM, OTM, or ATM (at the money, which means the stock is trading at the strike price.  I don't think we talked about ATM options yesterday).  Are you approaching expiration and the stock is trading sideways and you don't think you're going to hit the strike before time runs out?  You can sell it and cut your losses.  Did the stock spike deep ITM but you think it's going to crash back down?  Sell that thing and realize some profit.

*Who determines the price of a contract?  Who determines the premiums?  Do I set the premiums when I sell my contract?*

The premium/value of a contract is determined by an arcane combination of factors, including time to exercise, strike price, stock price, volatility, and others.  There is a lot of Greek involved.  There may be actual magic involved, too.  Either way, the price is set for you and you don't have to worry about it.  

*But who's going to buy my contract?  If nobody ever wants to execute, then who ends up with all the calls?  If nobody has shares to sell, who ends up with all the puts?*

I was surprised at how many people asked me this question.  The short answer is that it doesn't matter.  Someone will buy your contract.  The medium answer is that it could be individuals, institutions, or the market maker absorbing the trade if no one else will.  Regardless, calls/puts that weren't offset will be exercised by some entity or other.  In the case of calls, if they didn't want the shares, they'll just sell them.  In the case of puts, if they didn't have the shares to sell, then they'll buy them.

*If I sell my contract to someone else, am I on the hook when they exercise?*

No.  The writer, or the person who created the contract and first sold it, is the only person who will be on the end of an exercise.  If you write a call that goes ITM, then you can get assigned and have to cough up some shares.  If you bought a call and then sold it when it went ITM, then you don't have to sell any shares to cover.  If you want to learn about writing calls/puts, then maybe I'll do that next time.

*What if I don't sell my ITM option when it expires?*

It depends on the brokerage and whether or not you have a margin account.  Your brokerage will either exercise them, sell the contract for you, or let it expire.

*So what is the deal with time, then?  Or, when should I sell my contract?*

Time, which is referred to and measured as theta, plays a big part in the extrinsic value (or potential, as we talked about yesterday) of an option.  The closer you get to expiration, the faster theta decay (the loss of value due to time) is going to increase, and the faster you are going to start losing value.  In fact, there can be instances in which the stock price goes up, but your option value still goes down because theta decay is eroding value faster than the other pricing factors are increasing value.  For this reason, you generally don't want to wait until expiration to sell a call, and should have a plan to do so earlier.  Theta Decay is real.

*So when is ""earlier?""*

There are too many factors for the valuation of each option to give you a standard time to sell.

**IN CONCLUSION**

If you think a stock is going to go up, buy a call.  If you think it's going to go down, buy a put.  Sell your contracts.  Don't exercise them.  Don't wait until the last minute.  You have nothing to lose but your ~~chains~~ premiums.

That's most of what I can think of to say about the basics of buying/selling options.  Is there more to it than that?  Yes, but adding it in here will make it too long and too technical, and more articles that are too long and too technical aren't going to help people who are struggling to get the basics.  As I said above, I might do one last options post about writing contracts and maybe covering the Greeks.  We'll see.  Regardless, it won't be today or tomorrow.  Maybe next weekend.

I hope this all was helpful."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The post yesterday and this was the most clarity I have seen
 Thank you. From one ape to another."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Part 1 made sense. This one my smooth üß†isn‚Äôt able to get around. Guess I‚Äôll only buy calls! üöÄüöÄüöÄ
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape brain has first wrinkle after reading this.  Are you... are you our silverback now?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dunno, ""I explain things to idiots"" is a catchy book title."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Step 1. Steal underpants 
Step 2. ???
Step 3. Profit"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is selling the contract better than exercising it? Assuming you could afford to do so.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"So can we pretend for a second that I am a slightly more rich and much more morally absent ape then I am? I want to make sure I understand and explaining the inverse seems like a way to do that. 

Say I had 100 shares of GME. Closing price was $264.59. I think to myself ""there is no way we are getting to $450 by EOW and stealing bananas from other apes sounds like fun."" I sell a call with strike price of $450 expiring 4/19 and rake in my banana premiums. If we don't hit $450 by then I lose nothing, gain premium and buy some more GME with my money. If we do go to $450 or beyond someone exercises their option and takes my shares, but I lose all profit beyond the $450 because I promised and basically deserve what I got. 

On the put side pretend I have enough bananas to buy 100 shares at $100, but for some reason my monkey brain says screw buying at open I don't want more shares even though I know the stock is going to go up. So I sell a put telling people I promise to buy 100 stocks at $100 by 4/19. If the stock stays above $100 I get to keep my bananas and add premium. If the stock goes down someone exercises their option and I have to buy stocks worth $50 for $100. 

Do I basically have the idea for covered calls and puts? I know naked is different, but ape brain is still wrapping head around covered for now....

TLDR: sell calls if you think price is staying the same/going down, sell puts if your think price is staying the same/going up."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"TLDR. 

Smoothbrain version : Only place Calls. 

Don‚Äôt use margin."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for these. I am new to trading, but not so much a part of the GME thing. 

I have a few shares of AMC. Other than that, I put what little I have in CCL and RCL. I'm up 20% or so. I'm trying to learn enough to have a clue what move to make once the recovery stocks recover. I am happy I started learning this year. It's been interesting to say the least. 

Keep the lessons coming. They are much appreciated."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the explanation! 

Why is the second option for a put dumb? Looks like you still make profit. Is it because its better to just sell the contract?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you are just getting started don‚Äôt buy puts. They are much riskier than calls. Buy calls, get comfortable and then maybe consider puts at a later time."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im glad you added the portion about selling a contract you previously bought, ive seen a lot of people that are new to options that absolutely panic because they are afraid of being assigned on a contract they have previously bought then sold.  Really good basic explanation of the process of how options work, I think it'll help a lot of people."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're buying long-term calls (2yrs from now), what's the usual strategy? Do you buy ITM or OTM? When do you sell the contract?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,""" *So when is ""earlier?""*

There are too many factors for the valuation of each option to give you a standard time to sell. ""

If you continue this in the future, a guide to timing when to sell calls would be cool. I use the options price calculator to see if I think the option is still worth holding if it goes ITM early, but when I get to the monday of the week of expiration, theta ramps up and I have a hard time deciding."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for another awesome post.

Got a question, this is referring the 90K guy mentioned in the part1 post.

Can you pls explain how the 90K guy lost 90K? With what I learned I don't see him spent 90K. I see the following.

20 * 0.01 * 100+
10 * 0.01 * 100+
10 * 0.16 * 100+
10 * 0.03 * 100+
10 * 0.01 * 100+
1 * 10.58 * 100
=$1288 spent (or cost on premium). Where's the 90K coming from?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is it possible to exercise calls and puts that are out of the money?

For example, lets say that I'm stupidly rich and had 1000 GME $265c 3/12 (Did I do that right? Have I learned something?). They would be OTM right now, but if I tried to buy all 100,000 of them on the market, the prize would go up by a lot. Would it be possible to exercise the calls OTM to get the stonks without moving the market myself?

Thanks for the education! These posts makes me slowly climb up Mt. Stupid on the Dunning‚ÄìKruger graph."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If a stock is extremely volatile, like GME, why wouldn‚Äôt a person buy both a call and put for the same time period so that you‚Äôre covered on both sides? Is this stupid? Why?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Feels good to be the first one on the short bus!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens if a stock is halted from trading for a few days? Can you still trade the options? Does the time value still drop? Or will the expiry date be moved by those number of days?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If ""hypothetically"" a group was trying squeeze the short  interest in a stock and I was holding ITM call options, is this a case where I am better to exercise than sell the call? 

Doesn't this force market makers to produce shares and create upward pressure on the stock price? Or does it just not matter? What am I missing?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is one of the reasons I come here. Excellent explanation. Now I dare you to explain Black Scholes option pricing and a zero cost collar....üòÇ
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a great primer, thanks. I'm looking forward to part 3, which will cover the selling of calls, which is what I started with."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Again ü¶ç simple

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for these posts!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please talk about the mechanics of options trading. Buy to open, sell to close, sell to open, buy to close"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"OK, my first question is what is the advantage of buying deep or just in the money option? I have bought out of the money options for both puts  and calls, but I do not understand the attraction forI TM options have. Secondly,in regarding puts, I‚Äôm a little confused on why you said‚Äúthat‚Äôs dumb‚Äù.  I usually buy options without exercising mainly because I do not have the underlying capital to exercise, but why would it be dumb to buy for 40 and sell for 100 per share?
Also what do you think about leaps, are those a lot better and With a lot less theta decay.
Thoughts on otm options disadvantage/advantage?"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking legend. Thank you.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks very well explained... almost seems easy. It's a very interesting topic sadly (or luckily for me) in my broker I can't even do options.

If you are going to do a follow up, would be nice to hear your opinion on how to take confidence with options without blowing our entire accounts."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great stuff - thank you!

I had a question about the tens of thousands of puts at the sub $10 level for GME this week, and future, that is all still open interest. 

Similar to a gamma squeeze where delta will pull the price up as MM stay delta neutral on an increasing stock, is there an inverse effect from puts? 

The volume to OI ratio on 800c makes me think folks are buying those and selling them relatively quickly when the stock increases... but there‚Äôs more then 100,000 contracts of OI with nearly no volume on the puts. It clearly isn‚Äôt going to drop to any level close enough to exercising and whoever is placing them, if it was to make money, probably would have sold them during the huge drop Wednesday? 

I‚Äôm wondering, because they‚Äôre so cheap, if this could be a tactic by the shorts to keep the price down? Would it create a similar inverses gamma squeeze on price should they say, do something exactly like Wednesday?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yesterday I appreciated your post so much, but it took me a while to figure out what the potential gains for a call was. I came up with this: (sell price - strike price x 100 - premium). Is this correct? And using the same logic/formula, could you do a put?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, you're the psilocybin for my ape brain"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice work teach!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You should do one about selling calls/puts
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy more and hold? Got it
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont understand.

I'll take 2"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someome explain writing a put? I've got covered calls down but not exactly sure how I could go about writing a put.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Options for crayon eaters should be the name of your book or TedTalk.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you very much for making these posts.   Recently made me first call option, successful unfortunately, but I was a little nervous not having a clear idea of what I was paying into. 
These are excellent posts"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,thank you!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I buy stocks 100 at a time to sell contracts that get exercised or expire atm, why am i doing it wrong? idk, no one ever has."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,If anyone can answer this question. If your option is ITM on the expired date. Do you have to exercise or sell it that day or will it still be consider good after the expire date due to ITM. It usually takes a few days for deposit to settle so if you yolo a call that expired the next day it's almost impossible to exercise with any extra buyin power.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Too long for my ape brain didn‚Äôt read
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Your math on ‚ÄúHow the  Put Option‚Äù stinks. If I buy a $100 put on gme at $300 I make money below $200 lol. Obviously no one read this article lol
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why use many words when few do trick?

As a teacher... I didn't want to bother with this wall of text. Too much yada, too little üöÄ"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I read this - but just so I am clear, on some apps, is this also called ""Buy/Sale Limit"" ? 

Freetrade app lets you put a buy or sell price and if the stock hits that, it tries to auto sell or buy it for you (except it doesnt, as apparently Freetrade show the average price as it was 30 minutes ago, and when you hit buy you end up buying for loads more cos its changed since and they suck, but thats another story)"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Get this basic ass shit out of here and go to r/options id you want to learn. This sub isnt about teaching its about berating idiots and worshipping savants. If anyone here needs an explanation of options basics gtfo and learn, or fuck up and lose. Either way this shit is lame"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,ü§Æ
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe you got it really drunk and told it you loved it.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Because I just bought in.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because you bought a put. It's a catch-22. If you buy a put the normal hedge of that sale is to sell shares (usually short) to negate the positive delta. This isn't 100% of the time, selling a put for the positive delta exposure can also be a great way to indirectly profit on a long-term bullish thesis during times of high IV. 

There are tons of trading strategies, but most of the time a put turns into shorted or sold shares somewhere.

Stonks go up. Bears r fuk."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Because a put my tendies on them
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It wouldn't. Stonks rise heil. üìà
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,If the stocks damaged enough you just have to tell it it has pretty hair.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea wtf?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I might get my first brain wrinkle.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://youtu.be/SD7sw0bf1ms

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,A trader can make ton of money by SELLING puts when IV is a bajillion %
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Second that. Thanks!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,That part had me rolling lol
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Didn't they buy them Wednesday of last week at like.... $.40

If Thursday the squeeze happened that $.40 could have mooned as the price sky rocketed. Even if GME didn't hit $800, the quick rise in price and volatility would have made those contracts boom as well. Even if they were OTM."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,$800c are much cheaper than $300c
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Premium costs are higher the closer you are to an at the money strike. You can leverage your money for massive gains if you're way out of the money and things go your way. I remember some beautiful ape bought some zero day to expiry GME call option as far out of the money as he could get with 800 dollars and it so happened that GME did it's magic and he ended in the money and turned 800 dollars to 114k. Pure autistic power move that panned out.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don't have to have your call go ITM for it to gain value. Someone  buying a $800c on GME is likely not expecting GME to get to $800, they are betting GME swings up, and they can then sell that call for a profit. The value from this play is on volitility and a position like this is not supposed to be held for long. 

You can buy 01/22 $.005 puts on GME, 2 weeks ago they were worth a penny, this week they are worth four cents. Will GME drop below a dollar? Unlikely, but since the stock has gone crazy, the IV has made these positions worth 400% more."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because the further OTM, the cheaper contracts are, making it possible to buy more of them (or just spend less)."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"because this sub is full of people who honestly believe they are going to turn their last $1000 into $10000000+. An 3/19 $800c is around $520, while a ITM 260c is $4400. Go to the expiration just past earnings and those costs double."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems like the $800c should be much cheaper
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This was a great article thanks
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Apes no need puts if stonk only go up
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Almost like the whole series called ""SomethingSomething for Dummies"" üòâ

Edit: https://www.amazon.com/dp/1118982630/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_imm_C73S3HFFW25Z5335RB0H"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Step 2. is sniff. Always sniff stolen underpants.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Because usually you're going to make more profit if you're selling it.  If you exercise it you are throwing away the extrinsic value of the option.  Youtube has some great videos on exercising vs. buying and selling and option.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The premium for the contract has more value than just the underlying stock. You'd be throwing away money to exercise prior to expiration in most cases. One circumstance where exercising is worth it is when the premium is worth less than a dividend that is about to pay out.

Something like 80-90% of contracts are not exercised. Most people don't intend to buy the underlying stock and just use options as a platform to make money."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"ROI , the I is minimized. More play $$$$$"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape right
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sooo okay I‚Äôm trying to wrap my head around it, but in this case you‚Äôd still be making insane profits no? Because they must buy the shares at the strike price? Is writing a call option even a lose? Say those hundred shares costed u 10$ on average. Someone exercises your call for 450. You‚Äôre making 440$ profit x100 shares plus the premium. Is there any real way to lose when writing call contracts like this?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Or buy stonk. This is the way.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,My best options have been $CCL 22.50 for July 16
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you explain why puts are riskier than calls when buying?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Alternately, selling a put is less risky than selling a call (uncovered) since your risk is limited/known, yes?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are a lot of variables.  The greeks, the possible direction of the long term play, the company itself that you're investing in, new technologies or leadership within the company, the current cost of the premium.  Very long options you basically have to do a lot of DD and see where you think it'll land and what it will take to get it there."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have no idea what I'm doing.
But, if I were buying a call I'd go way OTM , buy them stonks w my Wendy's Dumpster earnings and tell my buddies, "" this is  the one. üòúü§£
If it ever goes up,  sell it .
Not financial advice"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I was wondering the same thing. I just assumed it was premiums.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe there is a reason why its differentiated by OTM and ITM. ITM is the point where you can exercise. OTM you won't even if it's by a dollar. I dont know if after hour works with option or not on the expire date. But it seems like gme closed at 264.5 so your 265 is still consider OTM hence u cant exercise and its consider expired worthless. I'm still learning but this is my understanding. I bought my first few option last week and my ass is bleeding red lol.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Is it possible to exercise calls and puts that are out of the money?

Yes. That is your right as an option holder. You're almost certainly throwing away money, but if you *really* want to, you can exercise even out of the money options."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are strategies that do just that.  For example a Straddle is buying a put and a call at the same strike.  Good if you‚Äôre sure the stock is going to make a big jump, but not sure which direction.  Downside: they are expensive (cause you pay for TWO premiums), and if the stock doesn‚Äôt move enough you‚Äôll loose both."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"> What happens if a stock is halted from trading for a few days? Can you still trade the options?

No.

> Does the time value still drop?

Yes.

> Or will the expiry date be moved by those number of days?

No. Trading *suspensions*, issued by the SEC, are usually the result of a major issue with the security (for example deliquent paperwork or some other anomaly) or market (circuit breakers), and the dates aren't moved as a result."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,See where Magic was mentioned üòÅ
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,don't think this guy actually bought GME puts with a $100 strike

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Do options actually benefit the functions of the market in any way or is it just a casino?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,you only lose potential gains if the price kept going up
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lost potential. You were forced to sell at 450 but perhaps it went to $1000

Covered calls are a great way to make some premium when you set a target at a price point where you are comfortable exiting the stock. 

Take a different example. You buy stock A at $10 cause you think it‚Äôs going to go up. You sell a covered call with a strike of 30 about 3 months out. You think ‚Äúif I triple my investment I‚Äôll be happy to sell in 3 months‚Äù. And you get the premium now. 

But then 2.5months from now Stock A releases a briefing saying they‚Äôve found a way to turn water into wine for basically free. Stock A price shoots up to $100/share over the following two weeks. You‚Äôre now forced to sell at $30, missing $70 of growth, which is pretty significant."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"For a stock like GME, suppose there is a 5% chance it goes to $1500/share before expiration.  By selling $450 calls, you are losing 0.05*(1500-450)=$57.50/share in expectation.  That dwarves the premium you get for selling the contracts.  So if you believed in this 5% chance, you shouldn‚Äôt sell those calls."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You have to lock up cash when you sell a put. Your broker makes sure you have enough money to buy the shares if you get assigned.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"you can actually exercise if you want, but it's not a very good idea."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gotchya, thank you! :)"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm guessing you're using Robinhood. I actually [explain that here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4qfpu/there_was_a_moment_this_week_that_my_175_312/gqxvwvp/). It's actually possible that when it was ""500k"" that it was someone messing up an order, but idk."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's futures speculation, and I believe they help the market. FDs are definitely a casino play, but the great thing about options is you can become the house or the player. I've made some good money off of selling covered calls and credit spreads. I read this article today, and it ended with the quote below. It seemed to answer your question so I've linked it. 

https://moontowermeta.com/how-options-confuse-directional-traders/

Ultimately, options help to ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù a market. A simple stock price is just the expected value of a stock (equity risk premia and arbitrage pricing theorists are welcome to have a cage match over that statement. I‚Äôll be out back selling beer). By imputing more information than a one-dimensional expected value, option surfaces give us a richer picture of expectations.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't hate on anyone lol, you do you. My question is, in your opinion, are the people that are told to buy stock only just the fuel for those that buy options to make way more money than the stock holders?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Or do both options and stocks help bring stock price up?

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Basics of Vega

Volatility measures the amount and speed at which price moves up and down, and can be based on recent changes in price, historical price changes, and expected price moves in a trading instrument. Future-dated options have positive Vega while options that are expiring immediately have negative Vega. The reason for these values are fairly obvious. Option holders tend to assign greater premiums for options expiring in the future than to those which expire immediately.

Vega changes when there are large price movements (increased volatility) in the underlying asset, and falls as the option approaches expiration. Vega is one of a group of Greeks used in options analysis. They are also used by some traders to hedge against implied volatility. If the vega of an option is greater than the bid-ask spread, then the option is said to offer a competitive spread. The opposite is also true. Vega also lets us know how much the price of the option could swing based on changes in the underlying asset's volatility."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options give you more leverage per dollar, but at a risk of losing it all. People that are here for a co-op game of holding GME are pawns IMO.

but the road to being a successful traders is consistently growing our net worth...even if it is at snail‚Äôs pace. Therefore, risk-management if more important that risk tolerance.

Will I be ok with a drawback of 75% this time around? Hell no! The goal is to become a more intelligent investor with each trade. 

With stocks that have a bright future, a combination of options and stocks are the way to go, try a 20% options and 80% stock portfolio allocation. And then experiment with different ration. But make sure to take profit and put into an savings account that isn‚Äôt associated with the brokerage account. 

During the mid February market correction, I made a few bad trades because I was practicing efficient trading and risk-management.

2021-03-14 18:38:04,wallstreetbets,"Portfolio plan for the months/quarters ahead | in context of yield, inflation and interest rates (Open to criticism if you think I am wrong or disagree) I am not a financial advisor and the below is my personal assessment of how things could unfold in the coming few months/quarters. And based on my assessment, I have tried to draw up a plan which I think might work in generating decent return with low to medium portfolio downside risk. This is not particularly a WSB-ish post, just because I am trying to not go full retard with my money.

Assumptions:
1. Fed to keep interest rate low till 2023
2. More fiscal spend in the coming months involving trillions of dollars

Let me start by saying that we don't need to figure out whether we will have inflation in the near future or not. Let the bond market speculate on that. We just need to follow the bond market and its expectation of inflation. That's all we need to do in order to allow ourselves a better chance to make money right now.

If the bond market's inflation expectation goes up from here, so will the 10Y yield. If the bond market's expectation of inflation goes down or remain as it is right now, the 10Y will remain where it is or will go down.

Note: at 1.6 yield (current yield) one would only buy a 10Y if they estimate that long term inflation is going to be less than 1.6.

If the yield goes up from here, tech or broadly speaking Nasdaq will continue to struggle further. And value stocks such as financials, energy companies, consumer discretionary will continue to outperform.

If yield remains where it is, expect tech to bounce back in the medium term, but value stocks will still remain the favorites.

If yield goes down, which would be a surprise, tech will climb back rapidly and value stocks will probably experience a correction, since they have already run up a lot in the last few months.

I personally think there is a greater chance of yield going higher from here, so being in value stocks or reopening stocks makes more sense to me.

However, since there is always the off chance that we experience runaway inflation, I think it would just be wise to hold perhaps 15% of your portfolio in inflation hedges such as REIT, or in a commodity ETF.

If real inflation actually rises in the next couple of quarters, Fed might or might not raise interest rates immediately.

If Fed doesn't raise interest rates and lets inflation run up, it might do so because the Fed might believe it is a short term phenomenon. Anyway, if inflation does run hot above 2% targeted, expect 10Y to shoot up.

In a higher than expected inflation environment, equities usually underperform, historically. Tech definitely would not be the place to be in. Safe bets would involve: consumer staples, energy and utility companies. These are considered safe because these industries could pass on their costs to the consumer, so their operating margin doesn't get impacted. Financials would also do well if this scenario plays out, because their net interest income would improve, because of steepening yield curve.

Commodities should also outperform during this scenario because high inflation will drive up the prices of agricultural products, livestock products - gold and silver will become attractive as store of value, property prices will go up (REIT).

In this scenario perhaps you should start building position in the dollar (cash) and also be equally weighted between commodities/property and stocks (financials/utilities/consumer staple).

If Fed raises interest rate as a response to rising inflation, it will do so because Fed wants to cool down the overheating economy.

In this scenario of rising interest rates, expect dollar to bottom and for it to surge as long as interest rates remain high. Commodities and REIT will underperform. Stocks will experience stagnate return or maybe even a bear market. If so, your built up cash position in dollar should probably go into buying the dip of attractive companies."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great post. I agree, bold yields are going up and it‚Äôs possible they keep going up more than expected. Look at the green dildo chart for the 10Y yield, tech stonks are fucked if this shit keeps going vertical. Stimmy checks gonna pump the market short term but any yield increase will take us down to üåàüêª land."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Excellent piece of commentary that highlights the different sectors in relation to interest rates.

I would like to add that there is also another risk factor. The corporate debt unwinding and increased default risks of many junk bonds will result in a bear market. When senior tranche of shareholder is missing their coupons payment because companies can‚Äôt roll over their debt, it is going get ugly. 

Take note on cruise debt offering because they were rather attractive at 11% coupons payment in 2020. Remains to be seen if the market has more appetite for junk bonds."

I read advice from someone here on Reddit saying ‚Äúnever sell for a loss.‚Äù Stocks go up over time and you might have to hold a bad investment for a long time to turn a profit, but most of the time you will. I haven‚Äôt been at this long enough to confirm but it seems sound.

Now, I get sometimes it might not be possible and it definitely won‚Äôt work for everyone but so far I‚Äôve been subscribing to it. I‚Äôm able to do this because I‚Äôm using my ‚Äúfun money‚Äù to try and learn about stock trading. If I lose it all (like $600 over the past 3 months) it‚Äôs nothing to me but a minor irritation. My bills are paid and savings not affected. I understand this is a luxury not everyone has because some people use money they shouldn‚Äôt for this kind of thing.

I‚Äôm shit at stock trading, so I‚Äôm on this graphic somewhere before the ‚Äúfuck it, I‚Äôll sell‚Äù stage. But I‚Äôm not selling. Next pay I‚Äôll put another $100 in and try again. Or maybe buy a new video game, I don‚Äôt know.

I don‚Äôt know that I have a point. Might be that people who fit the trend in this graphic are using money they shouldn‚Äôt thinking Reddit stock advice is a get-rich-quick scheme and maybe someone will rethink that based on what I‚Äôve written. Might be I‚Äôm totally full of shit and my strategy sucks, and someone more experienced puts me on a better path.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll admit: I was #11 for a few days before I bought again cause I just KNEW it was going to go back up. So glad I did
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Really? Ive been trading for a year only and this is the dumbedt shit ive ever seen.. either daytrade or buy&hodl, no?"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's why I tell myself that the green ones aren't ripe yet. And I don't do market orders. I want it for a discount."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey! Stay out of my computer...üò¨
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Diamond hands are nit rated E for everyone.... I haven‚Äôt sold a single share. I‚Äôm riding this all the way either direction. Lol
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought at the top of GME the first time. First ever trade.

I then proceeded to do the opposite of what my anxiety told me to do and averaged down at the bottom. Currently standing at a profit of 130%.

This strategy will never work again because it wasn't a strategy in the first place. 

Trying to read as much I can on different stock fundamentals and on technical analysis every single day from now on."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,So good.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Literally, every big loss I've had was a result of this. Also, so many unrealized gains from selling too early. Diamond hands is the way. Also, have a strategy"

Also the other side of this is new person (thinks) they've identified a trend, make trade, win. They repeat and then lose. As there initial win was a fluke but to them it confirmed their identification/analysis thus giving them false confidence."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I cant stop seeing kats everywhere
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Given this charts painful accuracy I‚Äôm not sure you can call it a shitpost.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I learned this the hard way with Diamondback Energy. It was a hard but necessary lesson I won‚Äôt forget.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Do people really do this? Literally just hold.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Big Ape Move: buy stock and hold until you can buy a year's worth of tendies with the return after taxes.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what happens to non believers. True believers will hold
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. This brilliant trading strategy cut my holdings in a third. My only saving grace was having invested in RIOT after paperhanding gee em ee  like the bitch I am.

Not financial advice."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy crap #11 is my March 8th
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Still holding my single GME but didnt get to buy in the dip oh well, but got my 40 AMC though."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I think all investors have started this way. You gotta do stupid shit before you learn not to.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"In conclusion, HODL"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,TY for this new wallpaper.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why I never sell at a loss. They can sit there in the red for a year or longer.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only keep 3 of those numbers.
1. Hold
13. Buy the dip.
19. Hold"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Get out of my head god damnit
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Learn the charts. You can find out a lot about a stock if you read the charts. Now with gme is a little different because there's a lot of volatility in it for the chart still tells you a lot.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"My philosophy has always been that if I just bought the peak and it‚Äôs now crashing that I invested in that company and those shares are now long term holds. 
If I bought at the bottom of the dip correctly then I‚Äôm swing trading those shares."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Actual good info thanks. But isn't Gamestop going to be a particularly unique graph though because the company is well... Only really valued right now because of the squeeze. Or am I incorrect with how I'm thinking about this?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, my trading style. Love it!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You missed 8.5: How can the SEC allow these ladder shorts to happen!

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm glad I didn't sell, having first bought in at $387. I bought the dip and now I'm in profit, before the squeeze has even begun."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I gave up. I did this exact thing and realised trading/investing is not for me. Brain is required and my last 3 braincells are too busy trying to get through exams and life in general.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,:(

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs why you hold if the market goes down. Diamond hands and all.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,My problem is getting liquidated while sleeping. If I was awake I would have increased the position but it goes down to a number I never thought possible but I know that number is WAY oversold.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great chart, I really needed to see this on a Sunday."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,GameStop taught me to just hold the fuck on and everything will be ok
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats me, but im lucky, ive bought in again at 14"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I work with that guy....lol

Once...he sold while the stock was dropping...saw it shoot up the next day and asked me if I thought that they would let him buy in again at the price it was the day he sold because the world of finance lets you do rewrites.

I told him to call them and ask.....üòÜüòÜ"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the average investor.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is basic but buy low, sell high.
This also means, buy red, sell green.

It‚Äôs tough to do at first, but gets a little easier as you see the cyclical nature. You don‚Äôt want to buy the green or sell the red, generally."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Replace every node with i like the stock

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Most have no more money to buy during the dip since they put EVERYTHING in the stock already. If you tell people to always have 30% liquidity they laugh and say that's 30% creating opportunity cost. The same guys will sell their dropping stocks to pay the rent.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm used to losing all my money when I miss my sports bets. If a stock goes down 80% that‚Äôs not a big deal, why would I ever sell? It could go back up and if it doesn‚Äôt that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm used to anyways"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't care if I have to wait 10 days or 10 years, I never sell red."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Eventually that 4% of the stocks that keep the market going up always go up.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus Christ...when did wallstreet**bets** become fucking /r/investing??  I miss the days when share buyers were laughed out of the room because that's not what this place has ever been about.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Because chasing losses is poor management.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't understand it either. I put 2k down knowing I could lose it all. When it went down to 800 why would I sell? I ""lost"" the money as soon as I bought the stock there's no reason to try to recoup anything"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Tell that to HYLN :(
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I just hope GME still moon because otherwise this buy would be the baddest.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options are the weird inverse of stocks in they benefit from the trend so much greater, so you don't average down, but average up, because of the finite timeframe. Makes no sense until you realize that the trend is your friend, and averaging into an up trend will leverage you properly to take profits and average out as the trend slows."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the entire subs options strategy

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,right? how do they do it? its like they buy that bottom part or something.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Just take more pharmaceuticals to support your stock.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,100% work
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"just wait for it to drop to 60 before selling, then when it reaches 40 be happy you sold. Until it reaches 500 2 weeks later at least..."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, sell when it's green.. don't wait for greener shades."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the main takeaway from WSB should be 1) it‚Äôs ok to lose any money you don‚Äôt need if you‚Äôre chasing a dream and 2) don‚Äôt fucking listen to a bunch of self proclaimed idiots that are explicitly telling you not to listen to them. 

And my two cents of advice from one new trader to another: start with a small bag while you‚Äôre getting your bearings. Make the mistakes, learn from them, and then play with a bigger bag. I tried my first swing trade with 25% of my entire portfolio the other day. Took the position at the worst possible time and spent the next 36 hours glued to the ticker doing everything I could to minimize my loss."

I'm still making money but I can't wait to get with a broker that's cool with me winning."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it's weird. I'm holding quite a bit of GE myself and they recently announce a 1 for 8 reverse stock split.  Which is normally used for failing companies to keep their stock on NYSE but GE isn't failing and their stock is nowhere near the 1$ mark for getting delisted.  They're doing it because of the perception of a low double digits trading price when other similar trading cap companies have far fewer shares with a higher price.  Like it's literally nothing and yet the price lost almost all of it's gains from the last year last week.  I'm still up a bit and I'm going to keep holding cause I'm not worried, but feels like a lot of people will be missing out for a nothing burger."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like the OTC stuff generally blows up in after/premarket any by the time your trailing stop came into play its already done and over with.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not a single crayon break on the chart , I'm calling üêÇüí©"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Also look at SPEC ( Prospect Capital Corp) for long Hodl with dividend pay monthly.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Sometimes there are better opportunities so I sold at a loss to take advantage of the better opportunity.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"What if it takes weeks or months to recover? Now you‚Äôve lost all the potential profit you could have made with that money in the intervening time. 

This seems an especially poor decision for new traders with little money in play and who tend to go all in on one thing. For those people, what you‚Äôre describing is a way to achieve a significant loss unless the value goes up sufficiently to equal what they would have made with that money while they were instead hodling. 

I see what you‚Äôre saying, but it won‚Äôt always work out that way."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Look up momentum trading on investopedia and unsub from here please.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The ""value"" in GME is it's performance as a company, it's size and reach.

The fact that it's been discounted during the pandemic and premature hype for digital distribution meant that the market was underestimating that value.

Then shorts saw an opportunity to wipe out the company and strip it bare for a profit. Not a value play just dickhead hedge fund behaviour.

DFV, Burry etc recognised the value and that the stock was under performing, bought in and released DD. They and everyone else hopping in before rumblings of a squeeze were value investing for the long term.

Maybe some of the smarter people saw squeeze potential last year, but mainly they saw a valuable company going insanely cheap for anyone able to hold.

The mechanics of the squeeze itself are not based around value, but instead the play is calling the bluff on the shorts. We're (I assume) buying stock cuz we agree with the value investors AND have the clues hinting at MOASS territory.

But let's be clear, the maximum you can sell your shares at will be far and above any honest value, we're capitalising on shorts playing a game with basically undefined risk, while we have undefined reward, as the options expire and it all unwinds we sell for what we want, not what it's ""worth"" in a long term value sense.

Value wise I think you had to be in since last year and if that was your thesis the squeeze hardly matters, GME is more valuable than what it was trading at. Now? Fuck value, I want pure irrational gain."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Having avoided FOMOing on this sub for a long time until this year, I advise looking for more current DD on new plays.

For sure open an account, and for sure try to get you some GME below 200 during next week's volatility, but don't be sad if your order doesn't fill, there's lots of other stocks."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"But it's true. Buying the dip sounds great until you try to backtest that strategy, and you notice you can never predict when the dip bottoms out and moves back up for a broad index, or for a single stock if the dip will bottom out at all. Stonks can go to zero. Therefore it's best to not try, and to not waste the oppertunity cost of your money by waiting for an oppertunity that's impossible to identify.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"> As long as you aren't over leveraged

Many people aren't over-leveraged in terms of margin or maxing out credit cards... they just don't know what their ""willing to lose"" is; or in the case of stocks, what their ""not see again for a long time"" is, or what a long time is in the first place. They confuse it with ""what's the amount of extra money you have after bills, that you want magically doubled in the next month or so"" or with ""you know, the worst that could happen is it goes down 10%, but the upside is unlimited, see? here's some people that tripled and quadrupled their money, don't you want your extra grand that you saved to turn into 3 grand?"" over-leveraged."

You would *ideally* want to buy when options have low IV and let the increase in IV jack up the price of the option that you're already holding. IV is just a measure of uncertainty. Not an indicator of the direction of a move, but an indicator that a move is likely going to happen.

Buy low (IV) sell high (IV). Same as stocks."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"How many did you buy and what are the prices at? This is where things like covered calls can bring back your bad decisions. For instance:

You made a horrible timing decision and bought into SNDL at the absolute peak of $2.95 a share and you bought 100 shares. You now have spent $295 for 100 shares that at their lowest point since were worth $1.14 a share and now are at $1.42 a share.

Your choices: Sell now and get $142, a loss of $153. Doesn't sound great. Wait around and hope it gets back up past $2.95 so you can get out of it. Could take a while. Sell a covered call, there are multiple choices out there but say you mostly just want your money back so you sell at the $2.50 strike price for July 16th. You pocket $45 now and $250 if the call expires ITM and someone calls away your stock. This gives you back your $295 and you can go on more knowledgeable about investing in your meme stocks. Or you say, no, I don't just want my money back, I want to *triple* it, so you sell a July 16th covered call at $9 strike price and only pocket $15 now but you either keep your stock or someone pays you three times what you paid."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"We‚Äôre not talking about sensible, seasoned investors pulling out to reinvest elsewhere, we‚Äôre talking about newer traders (like myself)  jumping in on a fad, and then pulling out because of fear.  A LOT of new traders bought in with the dream of the stock skyrocketing, but did not fully consider the implications of the play going sideways, nor did they have any real knowledge of the market to begin with (I admit to being a novice, but I continue to learn more everyday).  I find it highly unlikely that those traders are going to do anything else but put their losses back in the bank.  

I dropped 4k on AMC, no DD, and no expectations, only hopes - I have a good job, I still have money in the bank, my bills are paid, and I‚Äôm prepared to lose my entire AMC investment on a gamble because I believe in what we‚Äôre doing here, I believe that the movies aren‚Äôt dead, and yes, because I like the stock.

Paper hand, diamond hand, do what you must - but unless you‚Äôre day trading, or have done some rock solid DD on a potential short play - you shouldn‚Äôt even be buying the stock unless you believe in the fundamentals and the future of company it belongs to."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, more people should watch out for that one. Including myself. So buying the dip would be, refering to the chart above, 13, for example. Then curse at 14 and buy again at 15?

At least i had enought to constantly lower it. Bought first at 295 Euro and was able to get my avg down to 101. Its okayish right now at least :p"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The thing is a ""falling knife"" and a ""great buying opportunity"" look virtually identical in the moment. Its only after (weeks, sometimes months) that you can tell what it truly was."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmm, you should probably set a limit sell order for your target price. That way you don't have to monitor it.

Trust me, I've had many a trade where I'm like ""well I've hit my target, but it coullld go up more"" and then it just drills through the Earth's core. 

AMC is in a bit of a weird position right now. A lot of AMC's price action is it being propped up by GME, so it tends to follow whatever GME does (although with smaller magnitudes in shifts).

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,And?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Tons of comments are dancing around this. Buy the dip if you think it‚Äôs coming back up. If you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll come back up then move on. Don‚Äôt just buy the dip because it‚Äôs dipping. Invest in the recovery
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the way.  If a stonk is down, I always try to figure out if it's because the company done fucked up or if ""the market"" is just retarded.  I'll usually look at the chart about the previous 3 months and compare to things like SPY, VTI, or whatever that tracks ""the market"" and see if there's a corresponding dip.  Assuming the company is not retarded, a corresponding dip means that the stonk went down for no real reason other than because people are retarded and panic or some shit.  This means that it's a good time to buy as the stonk will likely recover eventually."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean I get the point of taxing more when your gains are in the millions but again you'd probably pay the same amount in taxes if you worked and made the same. You'd have to be not all that bright to not invest because you don't want to pay taxes. Even if you made $100k and owed $20k in taxes that's $80k you didn't have. I think the fear comes from bad investors that will cash out $100k and then spend the entire thing and have no money for taxes. As long as you're smart and put 20% depending on your status you'll be fine.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's the problem with options, everything's in stacks of 100 so small positions cut you out of a lot of the choices you could have. And if it's something you basically want to be out of, investing another $100 just to be able to try to get back out doesn't really feel good."

I saw Galapagos crash something like 15% in a matter of minutes, and I didn't know why. A few minutes later I finally found the announcement on google that they canceled one of their drugs. That's not a dip I want to buy."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha true, I think GME will be OK in future thx papa Cohen so I'm enjoying ride with averaged down price, I will profit nicely next week or next year, from the other side FOMOers who think GME shares are worthless but wanted play squeeze probably had to change pants after Wednesday megadip."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Just came to post this as well. Real Apes + WSB Apes  = üöÄüåïü¶ç
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It can‚Äôt be sheer coincidence, I just started reading David Attenborough‚Äôs: A life on our planet, and was stunned to see the same gorilla sanctuary (described in the book) being supported! 

But could someone explain to me how this trend for adopting gorillas started? Or is it simply a return to monke ü¶ç"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Make sure to check if your company will match your donation. That will get 2X leverage here.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not part of WSB though I love the memes on this sub. I have no GME as I'm too close to retirement to take much risk. But all these posts have made me realize I'm also an ape and I'm going to sponsor an animal.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"What the fuck man, you guys are legends"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It would be nice if GameStop mentions something about this during their Earnings Conference Call on March 23rd.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Man all this good has caused my allergies to flair up.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Love it, but I can't be the only one bothered by how it's supposed to be apes together strong"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is what happens when you give poor people money, we spread it for causes as we understand struggling more than the rich. What do you think the hedgies would do with their GME money had the tables turned?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I got myself an Ape today to! Might be the best money I‚Äôve spent in a long time.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,We should donate to autism awareness after this is over.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The Dian Fossey Foundation gets it! üíéüôåü¶çüöÄ
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Waiting to see how mainstream brainwashing media turns this into something negative. This is making my heart melt! Way to go Reddit! Adopt an endangered species, save the planet with profits! Too bad the hedgies won't get a clue and learn what's really important about money."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Love it
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I read at first ""The Ellen Degenerates Campus"", this is just perfect"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a former gorilla zookeeper, this shit makes me so happy ü•∞ü•∞"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What do we have to spend to get Ellen degeneres‚Äô name off the facility and rename it WSB Haus of Monke?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I love this sub Reddit
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This looks like an alternate timeline of Planet of the Apes.

Cesar joins WSB and lives happily ever after."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Anybody know hm has been donated?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,A movement within the movement. Beautiful apes I love you all.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm amazed by all of our generosity, my faith in humanity is restored."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This would make a great ‚ÄúBluff The Listener.‚Äù
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit this is great üòä
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,When you‚Äôre a random company getting the benefits of a meme based investment forum: ü¶ç
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Myself just ""adopted"" a rhino and decided to go for one year. But I realize that I cant just forget about it after one year due that would probably be a disaster for all kind of animals funds that gets more funding. I see that they probably will have alot of new adoption and funding now, and that mean they can invest more e.g. to help more animals and whatever cost money. However, if we leave let say about a year from now, which mean less funding for them, that will probably make more damage than gain?

So lets see this as long term investment/adoption, like the stocks we like!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://www.apeinitiative.org/ is plugging bonobos with ""APES TOGETHER STRONG"" in their headliner. 


support some fucking chimps."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am ordering one today. For those that have ordered what are you feeding yours? I have bought a bunch of raw meat and some chickens but I can‚Äôt find what they eat. Do I really just need to get a bunch of bananas? Also, how are you guys hiding them?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,How is it that a few WSB degenerates do more good than billionaire hedgies?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am financially ruined. Bought $69,000 of Ape futures and now they are shitting all over my lawn."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Brilliant
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"With gorilla gone, will there be hope for man?"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is not financial advice but I'm going long in banana futures!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"When hedge funds make profits they go to overseas tax shelters.

When regular people make profits they donate to charities and help animals."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Let‚Äôs see this being blown up on the news.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like the whole ape/gorilla thing is because a bunch of new traders that came into the sub for GME found retard offensive. I have been around here for a a couple years and don‚Äôt recall wsb autists referring to each other as apes before GME.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I fucken love you retards. I‚Äôm not in the GME or AMC but to watch what you‚Äôre doing and how impactful you have been is heart warming. Keep up the good work! Memer‚Äôs restoring faith in humanity. Didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd see that say /salute.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro what if more of the big subreddits did this? Reddit could become mainstream for all the right reasons overnight if they started doing their cross the site.

It's baffling (maybe not really) that billionaires, the mega rich, hedgefund co, etc are upset you guys are literally doing good with your money, and are even smart about it.  They are literally pissed you are outsmarting them and then trying to change the world in a positive way.

I'll never forget my first real vacation. There I was, a kid of 11 from the New York Snow Belt, basking in the warm sun of the Florida Keys. 


On my last day there, I went to the juice bar outside our hotel, on the beach. While I was waiting for my fresh tropical juice smoothie, I overheard two men talking. 


""Geez, Bill. That Conga line really took it out of me!"" Said one of the men, clean shaven except a bristly mustache above his lip. 


""I know, Ted. My legs are on fire! I haven't danced like that since college! Let's hurry up and get back there!""


The men, both wearing neon swim trunks, raced off over a sand dune and out of sight. 


I loved dancing! Tropical line dancing sounded so amazing to do right now. I grabbed my drink and sped off over the sand dune towards the sound of music. 


I followed the music into a secluded opening in a patch of palm trees and undergrowth. There, to my horror, was thirty men in a circle, each fucking the ass of the man in front of him while simultaneously being fucked from behind. 


Many years later I heard this is sometimes called a ""daisy chain"", or a ""gay Conga line"". 


It's the second gayest thing I've ever seen, next to Jim Cramer."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually that is also false.

The greediest people don't make the most money, but the greediest people _control_ the most money.

The greediest people will do everything to make their own value higher, while the not-so-greedy will stop at an acceptable level.

The only reason why Bill Gates was dethroned as the richest person, is because he started giving away all the money.

Read/watch any interview with rich people and they all can't wait to tell you how they're friends with all kinds of people with all kinds of politics. Meanwhile, if you're not rich and you're on the Right politically, ask yourself how many Commies are your buddies. If you're not rich and on the Left ask yourself how many of your buddies are Fascists. Now remember all the rich folks who hung out with rich war criminals in the ME, Rodman being buddies with Kim Jong Un, Trump saying he's friends with Xi Jinping despite trade issues, the list goes on.

>Can anyone imagine smug scum like Melvin Capital donating to wildlife?

You realize that Bain&Co. it's like the template of financial vulture firms, right? They're the ones that tanked Toys R Us while collecting hundreds of millions in management fees.

You have no idea who Gabe Plotkin is it what he donates to. You're not actually angry at Melvin. You're just following the herd. 

>Of course I'm aware that major financial institutions will have donated many many billions to charitable causes.

No, you're not. Hedge fund managers, not ""major financial firms"" have donated billions."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"PE, especially of the culture capital kind, make hedge funds look like charities. Sure, Melvin shorted a dying and hopeless company into the ground, but let's be real - 1. That stock price was cratering for years, long before Melvin got involved, and 2. Share price has absolutely nothing to do with the daily operations of a company. It doesn't matter.

Bain and others like them, on the other hand, purchase otherwise recoverable companies using those companies' own money, saddles them with unsustainable debt, and sells off the dying pieces, all while collecting management fees.

I know there's a lot of people who want a cartoon supervillain, because thinking is hard, but on the scale of ""evil"" business practices, hedge funds don't even crack the top ten. Hell, GameStop had worse business practices than Melvin. Remember when they sued cities to declare GameStop stores ""essential businesses"" so that they could put their employees in physical danger to make a profit?"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"From Wikipedia:  One possible predator of gorillas is the leopard. Gorilla remains have been found in leopard scat, but this may be the result of scavenging. 

Pretty much though. Pretty crazy too since the majority of their diet is plants/fruit and sometimes maybe bugs. Truly beautiful creatures and humans are the reasons for their dwindling."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"With many animals, the healthy adults are not in much danger of predators. It's the young, old, and sick ones that are in danger. So adult gorillas don't have to worry about leopards, but the young ones do (rather their parents have to worry). This is part of the reason that adult male gorillas sleep on the ground. They're too big to sleep in trees, and they don't really need the safety aspect anyway."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Chill bro. Markets closed. You on your period?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love older animations, it‚Äôs just how clean and modern this still looks compared to newer animation. I always wanted to have my own animation, I just can‚Äôt draw that much. It kills my hand. 

And I don‚Äôt mind 3D, at least when it is done right. What I *really* hate is when there‚Äôs an animation and studios try to skimp out on drawing and add the (horribly done) 3D on top of it. Just looks awful to have that amazing art ruined by an ugly eyesore. Do one or the other, don‚Äôt do both. It rarely turns out well."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imo you just have to view them as two separate things. 2D and 3D can both be masterpieces in their own rights. Although Disney did lag quite a bit in the 3D game.

The projects that have come out in the past year could let you become an AI animator and your work quality will improve with practice. Don't be hung up on your traditional art skills. Those will improve the more you do things.

I struggle with imposter syndrome too, and it's a *real* killer with art. It's easy to compare yourself to professionals and find yourself wanting. But those pros started where you are at some point, and they only got better because they kept producing art despite that."

2021-03-14 18:18:31,wallstreetbets,"Melvin, Citadel, and Point 72 (GME) I‚Äôm long on GME and enjoying this crazy ride with all of you fellow ü¶ç. Thank you to everyone on this community and especially those who have done some incredible DD over the last couple months. This has been one hell of a roller coaster ride. I‚Äôm proud of you üíé hands that held through Wednesday. 

I believe in both the gamma and short squeeze. The recovery from last Wednesday and to be holding this price integrity with such low volume in the last couple trading days has been encouraging. I obviously would have liked to see more of a bump on Friday 3/12 to trigger the heavily bought expiring 300 call options. 

In reviewing all the DD, I‚Äôm really only questioning two things, of which only one can be answered. 

1. I‚Äôve seen a lot of calcs on the actual number of naked short shares needed to cover. IMO - These numbers vary significantly and with the resources available is probably only conjecture and to be seen upon the conclusion of this squeeze.

2. MY MAIN QUESTION (AND REASON FOR THIS POST). We know Melvin was down 53% in January due to the first GME squeeze. They testified before congress these shares were covered. Citadel and Point 72 since have invested $3 billion in Melvin with an agreement for future revenue sharing. Why would they open themselves up to this type of capital exposure to a firm who‚Äôs teetering on the brink of bankruptcy? Especially if the intent was to double down and short GME again to recover these losses. Wouldn‚Äôt Citadel and Point 72 been better off letting Melvin fail and taking their own capital and shorting GME? I know the CEO of Melvin used to work for Citadel, but I just struggle with this ideology. Furthermore the SI (short interest) in GME has fallen by 50% since the first squeeze in January (correct me with exact numbers).

Again, I‚Äôm long on GME and not trying to be a FUD... But if anyone has thoughts on how these hedgies operate, please enlighten my poor ape intellect!

See y‚Äôall on the moon! I‚Äôll be the guy in the mullet handing out wife beaters.

ü¶ç RR"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look for counterfeit shares and how you hide them. The whole chain from HFs like Melvin to Clearing Houses is involved. They had no other chance than bailout Melvin to cover up their bs because of public attention. Now they are trapped in this bs. It's not only in GME, but many others. They found a loophole to trade more and more counterfeit shares of companies to dilute the float and force prices down. But they got greedy increasing this method like people always do. They were always able to hide it due to low public attention and therefore it was only greedy logical to intensify this strategy. It's like creating a bubble of counterfeit stocks.

But now if GME blows, it will potentially lead to investigations closing their loopholes. Potentially lifting of a whole armada of rockets.

That's why you need 5 attorneys in a congressional hearing and stare into the camera like a living dead."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just watched Gabriel Plotkin, CEO & Founder of Melvin Capitol speak to Congress. In the 5 minute vid, he says the reason investors in r/wsb bought $GME is because he is a Jew and we are antisemites. Not even kidding. The guy is totally full of shit. He just lied to Congress. 

I know this because I am not at all an anti-semite. I knew NOTHING about him when I bought 100K worth of GME. I did know about another guy though, I knew about the great leadership of Ryan Cohen and I bought in for that reason. 

So I wouldn't believe a word that comes out of the mouth of Plotkin.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak."" - Sun Tzu"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was Melvin on the edge of bankruptcy? I know they lost a lot of their investors money, but probably not their own. Citadel is the top market maker for retail day traders, probably get a lot of their revenue from the HFs as well. I bet they did their DD on Melvin and saw plenty of profit to be made in revenue sharing with a bailout."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Answer: not all (or even close to all) of Melvin‚Äôs losses were in GME. In January all their shorts went against them and so did their longs. This started the second week in January, by the 15th they had already  lost 10-15%. Other HFs could see what was happening and knew that they would have to delever so they piled on, bidding up their shorts and shorting their long book. Look at their 13F and look at prices in January. EXPE, BKNG, LB, PINS (longs) all down. GME, FIZZ, AMCX (shorts) all up.

TL; DR come on guys. Melvin isn‚Äôt the only HF in the world and GME wasn‚Äôt their only position."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,SI...you mean this self reported indicator ?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am not sure if it was Melvin shorted GME the second time around after a massive loss, highly unlikely. Likely it was other investors the second time shorting GME. 

The current short interest is 31.84% of the float according to Ortex but the cost of borrowing GME is significantly lower than it was once before. 

According to iborrowdesk.com the current fee (03/12/2021) to short GME is 0.8% per annum. In other words any short positions made with 0.8% fee, as long as the stock is 0.8% below the (03/12/2021) price, the short positions is profitable. 

With low fee, short positions will have many days before the plungers cover their shorts."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I've read some dd and on the internet about these synthetic shares but i don't quite get it. If a synthetic long stock is when you buy a call option and a put option ATM then how can they just sell it as stock to retailers like me? I mean do i have the stock or just some options? ü§îSorry if im asking stupid questions. I don't usually invest that much.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I have 145 calls expiring July but I am confident that the stimulus check will spark the market in a new rally also am confident of GME‚Äôs earning call.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If Melvin, or any hedge fund, is still net delta after all this then they all need to fire all their very expensive quants.  The obvious play for them here is IV with it being so high.  A lot of money to be made there without having price exposure.  Like, a LOT of money.  

Looking at options chains, there are a metric shit ton of OI on puts.  I mean, so many open puts.  From this, it's clear MMs are holding millions and millions of shorts as hedges against those puts.  A lot of those puts are tutes, but the numbers tell me that retail also has a lot of short positions too"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,because Melvin received cash infusion they will be smarter. I would imagine traders like Plotkin are managing billions of dollars because they are smart enough to not revenge trade.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Plotkin is such an asshole. Also, Ryan Cohen is also Jewish and he's the actual reason I became a believer and bought into GME."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Quadruple witching day. Options, index options, stock index future expire AND single stock futures expire all on the same day. It‚Äôs like pon farr for the stock market only instead of a sex orgy it‚Äôs a battle to the death to be in the money. 

Investors and hedgies are all going to be making plays this week. Plus the looming gamma and short squeeze on AMC and GME which may, or may not, start up this week.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs the story with his dad?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. They were supposed to be a good communist. There is no wealth separation.  There is no private property. The government handles everything for you.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love this move of adopting apes and other endangered wildlife.

1) it is truly a massive gift to all of humanity. Investing in the future of a world that still has biodiversity. For less than the price of a single GME share. ( I have allocated 1 GME share to the cause and made a small $100 donation) 

2) it is funny. I almost peed my sweatpants when I first saw all of the posts start flooding the sub

3) it is effective. From a self interested POV, this will translate to more news coverage, leading to more GME interest, more investment and a higher stock value for us HODLers.

2021-03-14 18:06:09,wallstreetbets,"$RIDE with me: DD, Lordstown 

Quick recap last week Hindenburg yes we all know them and if you don't do some of your own DD made a short report on Lordstown motors $RIDE
This made the stock fall to $15 per share which is down 50% from ATH
Lordstown is one of the most legitimate EV companies out there. A major partnership with multiple companies like camping world and GM. This is one of the worst-hit pieces I've seen.

First off fuck short sellers. Lordstown motors is a truck company that is bringing much-needed manufacturing jobs to the Midwest US FUCKING A This is an American company hiring people in a struggling city so anyone who shorts this stock is simply anti-America. Seriously fuck you for profiting from the losses in small American manufacturing city's. Even if you don't think Lordstown is a good investment is is outrageously toxic to make money on the failure of fellow Americans.

This hit claimed multiple things that I will now assess 

Edit*: for all you retards that can't read in the comments find me an OEM EV company that has binding pre-orders I dare you.

1) there is no demand.
Claiming there is no demand for an electric EV truck is insane. EV is the future and trucks are part of that by claiming there is no demand makes no sense and it's as simple as that. the tesla cybertruck has 400k preorders and I am sorry tesla retards but your local plumber, an energy company, and farmer jack arent buying a cybertruck. The real bros of silicon valley will buy the shit out of cybertucks so they can use them to live in because they can't afford rent but ain't no real truck work is getting done in a cybertruck.

3) the truck doesn't work
There are many videos of working prototypes not rolling downhill that can be easily found with a basic Google search these guys are probably using internet explore and bing search engine to do their DD or they're just blind. The Endurance truck is entered into a 250-mile rally in April and will be competing. Why the hell would you enter a race if your truck doesn't even work no one could be that dumb. The truck did have some issues as one of the prototypes caught on fire but the keyword is a prototype. Yes, no way I didn't know that experimental prototypes fail a lot of that's the whole reason prototyping exists.

5) preorders are fake
No, they aren't they are not binding pre-orders that is true but name one EV company with binding pre-orders even teslas cyber tuck can be ""pre-ordered"" with a non-binding $100 check so don't try and argue this is any different no one in their right mind would lock into a binding contract with any new EV company and no one has.

This report has caused RIDE short interest to shoot straight up and if a prefect candidate for WSBs good olde fashioned short squeeze to the moon.

The bull case. I grew the biggest testies and doubled down on this bad boy during the dip last Friday. my position 350 shares 5 long 2022 $30 calls. Mostly all bought on Friday

1) All pre-orders are for commercial use, the 100k preorders are from companies to use as fleet vehicles and they do plan to work into the consumer market after they ramp production more.

2) They own and will produce in the Lordstown plant previously owned by GM which already has a 500k car per year capacity

3) I agree with your take on autonomy I think it is vital to an EV company and this is very speculative GM who has the cruise Autonomous driving system is a pretty big investor in Lordstown and the CEO of Lordstown says they have a great relationship and want to expand their relationship with GM. So I would assume sometime down the road this could mean the integration of the cruise system in Lordstown trucks.

4) The Price, in your video you said you think rivan and Lordstown are kind of competing, I think this is a bit of a mistake, first rivan is a consumer-first company where Lordstown is mostly in the commercial space (right now) and Rivan vehicles will cost much more than Lordstown. I grew up and still do live in the city of Detroit and follow the automotive sector. I know a lot about rivian being that they have an office here in Plymouth Michigan. Their cars and trucks have a more premium price and the Lordstown truck is only going to cost about 50k which is pretty good considering normal gas truck prices. The rivan will be more in the 70k range.

5) This is an obvious Biden play Made in the US in the midwest (Ohio) a state that democrats barely lost, this would be a great PR political move to hype this company up just to get more Democratic support in the state and the midwest all together

Finally

6) partnership with RV world, they recently partnered with RV world to act as a place to service their vehicles, as we know when Tesla first came out and still to this day have issues servicing the cars. This partnership means that the day the first endurance truck rolls off the line there will be hundreds of locations around the US where technicians are already trained to work and fix these trucks, not to mention that both CEOs mentioned in their joint press conference that there is a goal to electrify 5th wheel trailers to help increase EV trucks long road trip range and build EV RVs.

Thanks for reading my ted talk I typed this on my phone so fuck you if there are any typos I'm not fixing that shit.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Been long RIDE since day 3 of its SPAC. Went from 300-500 shares after the dip. Go RIDE!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I read the Hindenburg ""study"",  it was worded so as to imply a lot but never to make statement that could lead to a lawsuit.  Also, they relied on estimates by ex-employees and totally misrepresented one of the people they interviewed to the point that he felt compelled to issue a public statement. To me, Hindenburg looks as slimy as shit and usually what I see is fairly correct."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm big on RIDE without a big holding and will give my thoughts-  

I‚Äôm a blue collar worker so I understand how big this EV product can really be. Dude is spot on with the Tesla truck just not suitable for a blue collar guy. 

The whole pre-order nonsense. Of course some if not most pre-orders aren‚Äôt going to go through. That happens with every pre-order ever in the history of business. The real sales don‚Äôt start until product is released and everyone knows that. They start the real manufacturing in sept. We still have a ways to go .

The stock is already low. Not sure why they decided to short the stock now. This stock isn‚Äôt going to hit zero. It‚Äôs backed by GM. It‚Äôs back by small town America in a swing state of Ohio, where the Democrats are trying to gain control for further elections. I actually love the dudes thought on small town America. There will always always always be a market for buying American.

I think we will see it go down a little bit more but I‚Äôm planning on buying a large position. Good luck to everybody considering RIDE"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you start with the guilt about shorting an American company you sound like a scam artist. These decisions should be based on the merits of the company, not some fake patriotism.

As to the FU, what about to Lordstown motors for scamming people to give them money for a dumpster fire they can't carry through on.

Let me know when they get to mass production of their inherently problematic design... In the meanwhile I have puts on them. Misplaced optimism may boost their price for longer then my options, so that is the risk I take (not a YOLO).

30X 10/15 $5P

20X 1/21/22 $5P"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm gonna go through all your arguments and show you where this is wrong. 

**""Claiming there is no demand for an electric EV truck is insane.""**

I agree with this for the most part, you are right here. Electric trucks are the future due to their superior torque capability and flexibility of chassis. The only thing holding EVs back is the charging infrastructure and battery technology. 

**""There are many videos of working prototypes not rolling downhill... The Endurance truck is entered into a 250-mile rally in April and will be competing.** 

For a company with the size and funding of Lordstown, making a single functioning electric truck prototype is not that difficult at all. (ie: Tesla Roadster concept got announced in 2017 and was supposed to come out this year, there's been zero news on that car since) and the fact that Lordstown is entering into a race should not convince you that they have the capability to make a production truck. 

**""No, they aren't they are not binding pre-orders that is true but name one EV company with binding pre-orders even teslas cyber tuck can be ""pre-ordered"" ""**

The orders are fake, read the Hindenburg report. Hell, read fucking Jalopnik if you want a TLDR. Thousands of orders were made by shell companies with fake addresses and questionable origins. 

Also, there are plenty of EV companies that have binding preorders with companies, namely their main competitor: Rivian

**""All pre-orders are for commercial use""**

As stated earlier, the orders are bullshit. 

 **""GM who has the cruise Autonomous driving system is a pretty big investor in Lordstown""**

GM has largely been doing their own thing with EVs after their whole relationship with Nikola trucks fell through. GM has been doing alot in the EV sector (just look at their 2021 CES presentation) but I don't think Lordstown is going to be a key player in this shift to EVs as they weren't even mentioned at CES. In fact, GM has their own electric truck coming with the GMC Hummer, so I wouldn't count on this GM relationship taking $RIDE to the moon seeing as how other EV companies have bigger investments from other companies. (IE Rivian has about $1 billion total from Amazon and Ford alone) 

Also, in the context of this scenario, autonomous driving doesnt mean shit. 

**""They own and will produce in the Lordstown plant previously owned by GM which already has a 500k car per year capacity""**

This is one of, if not the only point that Lordstown has any credibility for, and frankly I think it's bullshit. There is still millions of dollars that has to go into retooling the factories, retraining the employees, and working out the production issues. I think this saves them alot of money in the short term, but doesn't matter in the long term if you expect Lordstown to be a real competitor. 

**""Lordstown truck is only going to cost about 50k. The rivan will be more in the 70k range""**

hahahahahhahahahaha... It's funny that you think Lordstown can keep this promise. Electric trucks are new, the first generation of electric trucks is going to be expensive. Rivian knows this, GM knows this, which is why the Rivian is priced at $70k and the GMC Hummer is expected to start at around $90k. Not to mention that these companies are much closer to production than Lordstown. 

Just look at the Tesla model 3, that was supposed to be a $35k electric car, but if you want to buy one today youre probably paying in the mid 40s to mid 50s. If Lordstown gets to the same point as Rivian or GM, I guarantee you they're gonna be raising the price. 

**""This is an obvious Biden play Made in the US in the midwest (Ohio) a state that democrats barely lost, this would be a great PR political move to hype this company up just to get more Democratic support in the state and the midwest all together""**

This is actually the dumbest shit I've ever heard. 

And that about wraps it up, Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.

**TLDR: I don't think Lordstown is a good buy.**"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think there is an unexpected potential market for EV trucks. Preppers. The problem with fuel storage is that it‚Äôs hard to do, especially in a non rural environment.

To digress, I support moving away from fossil fuel autos as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but I'm not sure that simply replacing them with EVs is sufficient.  I feel ultimately that a move away from reliance on individual car ownership as the main means of transportation, and replacing this with greater public transit use, would be best."

Unfortunately I just can't seem to compete with the average hype and amount of ignorance people seem to have for EV companies. Sooo much of what I hear about EV companies and justifications for their valuations sounds just like the dotcom bubble. It'll run into trouble eventually, I just have to stop trying to time that."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What EV plays do you think have more upside?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep but not many will print money like this one. And please elaborate name one? I'm waiting....

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Use the Fox News report for some positive focused dd on fleet preparations. I think the main thing investors will care about is production timeline. If this GM plant with max cap of 500k/year starts work this year. Traveling from 2.5 billion valuation towards a value related to 500k - how ever many years off - is a multi Bagger. This is what the serious ones are looking to see on Wednesday, production start date. The fleet news has been every article now for months. 

I personally bought in, but I don‚Äôt know if I believe one side or the other fully, so I continue to use scaled covered puts as it goes up and down. 120% investment return via 6 months-if u buy covered puts the right way and stick to the plan. Not a bag holder, but I don‚Äôt not have bags"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you think people in rural areas would want public transit over their private vehicle?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the whole EV thing is as flawed as fuck but I have gotten past the point of caring.

If enough people jump on the bus there will be profits in selling busses. So far everyone thinks that EVs are the answer. Let's take advantage.   
Never fight the herd, recognize it but don't fight it."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,They disclosed a short position in their article...
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I found that a little suspicious too. HB said they are short in the stock at end of report... for them to say that, when nobody who shorts has the balls to say that these days... and they write reports usually for others to short a company... I figure if it‚Äôs a purposely faked report to stimulate a hype, it‚Äôs at least worth more than it‚Äôs at now on a faked down pressure."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, should be interesting to see lordstown‚Äôs response. Still doesn‚Äôt change my view long term. That‚Äôs business baby"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,i mean if the stock drops from 30 to 15 they've just doubled up. to go to 0 is great but that isn't necessarily the goal

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me know which reps Tesla paid $30 each for pre-orders?!

This company literally paid reps to get non-binding papers signed that say they will consider buying the vehicle one day. When you resort to paying for this stuff (as opposed to Tesla who actually gets paid a small amount or large amount, depending on vehicle, for pre-orders) that is as red of a flag as they come."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah people paid up front for Tesla roadsters when it was a startup and it‚Äôs value was much less.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Cool I guess they should stop going on tv and using their non binding purchase agreements as legitimacy and proof of future revenue

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am fed up with the GME thing as well. Was in the first round and got out with some nice gains, but since then it has become insane. Honestly, can't wait till it is over. There will be a lot of disappointed people here when it is over. The whole thing seems more and more like a ponzi scheme each day."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. This is a pretty small bet for me so not worried if I miss on this.
2. I did prior to Hindenburg's report mention I was looking to buy Puts, but was not sure about timing (i.e. when people would realize Lordstown's in-wheel motor is far more likely to be a failure then a success). After their report, I think the understanding here is more apparent to investors. Further, I think as people look deeper into this and pursue them for answers they will not be satisfied making the company fall even further. So I a more confident now in these puts then I would have been, buying earlier (would have been really nice though).
3. Lordstown Motors has a market cap of about $2.5B, whereas I think they have about $300M in assets. Assuming for the chance they are on to something a few hundred million gets added to their value, a market cap of $500M - $1B seems a distinct possibility. That would be a stock price of between $3.75 - $7.5. Given the high IV on the puts, bought the $5 ones which I think are quiet risky. I think the $10 ones have a decent chance of paying out (but they are pricey).

Basically, my original plan was to wait for the price to go up to some crazy number on idiotic euphoria and then go heavy in on puts. As it stands feel a decent chance they go down enough to make the puts I have worthwhile, but only went in a small amount."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Totally agree, there are only a handful of EV companies that I believe in (Rivian, Lucid, NIO, Tesla, and Canoo) and all these companies are either currently producing and selling vehicles, or have very significant investments from major automakers. The only exception to this rule is Lucid, but from seeing Lucid grow as a company they seem to be doing their development right, not making any outlandish claims, settings realistic time goals for production, and inviting automotive journalists to actually drive their prototypes. Lordstown on the other hand has only been in hot water since they IPOd."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah the lawyers call that ‚Äúdiscovery ‚Äú
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying puts then for 3/19

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,My bigger issue with them is I seriously doubt they will ever get the in-wheel motor concept into mass production. Inherently it poses numerous issues that I don't think they will overcome.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,False.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Paid 2k for the model 3 pre and 2k for 20 cyber pre (possible fsd taxi play)

Disregarding what OP and Hindenburg have said about this company, when I looked up the truck, at least it LOOKED like a truck. I'm gonna put this on my watch list, but it will probably keep going down for a while until they start mass production."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,F150 is the top selling vehicle in the USA and Canada. If they can successfully electrify it and pickup truck people are into it then my conservative price target for $F is $42069.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Sexy. I‚Äôve always liked the body style. Glad they didn‚Äôt go stupid.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought I will never sell my v8 f-150... but maybe I will ;)
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Anybody have an educated guess as to when it will be widely available?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,My portfolio looks like a reverse 2008. Ford is my only saving grace while the rest of my shit is in the red.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Next up the electric Ford Pinto, but please no explosive batteries behind the back bumper."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Not a fan of the paint job.  I'll stick with my blue tacoma.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Any chance it has the power of a turbo diesel...   I thought not...
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I concur. My analysis indicates 42069 inbound.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Plus they brought back the bronco and the electric mustang. Ford is really undervalued right now. Eventually people will realize that most of these EV companies are fraud and they can‚Äôt really produce at scale like Ford can, so the money will flow into Ford. Near term target for Ford: $20, $30 in a year. üöÄüöÄüöÄ"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but then you have to drive a Ford. No thanks.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm gonna pick up a twin turbo v6 for the quickness, but also the towing capacity of the v6 is the best in class. Beating every makers v8, which I had no idea until a few months ago. 

I am thinking maybe a 2018, Platinum (massage seats!)"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I heard that they sold out of preorders. Have some F from just under a year ago because there looking good. Would be good to get enough tendies to buy one of these.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt EVs give you higher torque? I thought that is why they are so fast off the line but then lose out at top speed.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"But why would it need it? This isn‚Äôt meant to replace all or even just  diesel pickup trucks, it‚Äôs meant to replace the pickup trucks who are used as family haulers and occasional ‚Äústuff‚Äù movers. There there thousands of F150s sold per year that will never see a dirt road or regularly find anything in their beds not bought at Costco. An electric option will sell to these buyers easily."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes it likely will, EVs have high torque, the challenge is that it drains the battery faster (drops charge range down quite a bit)."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve always drove shitboxes cause I‚Äôm good with cars and like fixing them up. The new bronco is the first time I‚Äôve seen a new car and been like ‚Äúok fuck it let‚Äôs rock a car payment‚Äù.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao I haven‚Äôt seen a type e on the road yet. No one will buy them because they are super ugly.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I don‚Äôt even disagree with this statement too much. Other than mustangs they haven‚Äôt made any cars that make my peepee move until the bronco.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"STLA has been a steady gainer with many brands and international exposure. I love that stock. Jeep knocked it out with the Gladiator that Ford decided to mimic the Jeep style. A mix of gas, diesel and electric future is a well diversified approach."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea I‚Äôve got 2017 f150 platinum for my personal use. I used to tow my dump trailer with it but the frame is too weak for it. So now I also have f250 heavy duty for work :)
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,They say that but the twin towing is a dog. I own 6 and I‚Äôm switching back to v8‚Äôs.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm going to wait until my one share of gme hits $50k and use that to buy one.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, tons of my neighbors have f150+ trucks that get no real work done except maybe for mulch season 2x a year. I'd get one if the avg wasn't like 50k+ for a new truck. America loves it's expensive grocery-getters.
I'll stick with my ranger for now :/"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I guess I push my trucks to hard to ever expect electric to make my cut.  Im pulling loads of building materials and driving miles out into the backcountry while hunting.  Yesterday I was up to the doors in a mud pit because the snow melted and flooded a dirt road.  Who knows maybe one day I would be ok with an electric truck for the wifey.  Currently I need be backup fuel tank for when I get a little to far from gas stations.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt like making car payments either. But might just say fuck it and go with a payment plan on the new bronco. I really like it.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You mean the Mach E? You‚Äôre out of you‚Äôre mind, they look great, get raving reviews, and I bought one myself from GME Round 1 tendies."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Same hopefully they hit a homerun with the bronco. Only vehicle that i like thats made by ford.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Makes sense to me. I like the F250 Powerstroke and 3/4 tons from most every maker, but that gets into a rather large daily driver for someone who will only have one vehicle til his tendies hit."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,every review I read loves the 3.5l twin turbo v6 for towing?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, assuming there isn‚Äôt some major design compromise this thing will sell itself. I can already hear Dennis Leary telling me I‚Äôve got better things to do than waste time filling up at a gas station or changing my oil and thanks to the new F150 I won‚Äôt need to. If you truly need a truck as a tool for work you still have the option to just get a traditional F150."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre not the target buyer for an electric truck going on sale in the next year or so, that‚Äôs fine. But not fitting your specific use case isn‚Äôt a knock on the product. It will be difficult for Ford to screw this up with how easily this could sell. Again assuming no major flaw yet to be realized."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,So does OJ...
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya also my dads a mechanic who hasn‚Äôt had a car payment since 1980, pretty sure he would murder me if I bought a new car."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I know I read the same things. I own a construction company and we have 18 pickups total. I‚Äôd never take a 3.5 to tow anything but an empty trailer.  Not buying anymore either.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,My 4 cylinder turbo will out tow the ford v8s
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,My 2.7 turbo is awful at towing. Disappointing. I‚Äôm not buying another f150 or ford again. Happy for everyone here who has made money on their stock tho

2021-03-14 17:43:39,wallstreetbets,"This sub has helped revive me(thank you) A few months ago, I was in a state of abject despair. I had been through two horrible/extremely heartbreaking relationships back to back, lost my job due to COVID-19(was living on unemployment and savings), I had developed a neck beard nest, was borderline suicidal, sleeping 12+ hours per day, etc. I had no interest in anything but smoking weed, jacking off, and sleeping.

Then, in December, I started following the GME stuff(didn‚Äôt have much to invest myself sadly), which lead to a deeper interest in the stock market, etc. I would wake up every day pre market(I had no sleep schedule before so this was big for me) and just sit there and watch various stocks and read discussion. It got addictive and I would be reading for 8 hour long sessions at times. I got more and more into it, to the point where I was reading books about the market(I hadn‚Äôt read a book in two years before) and just generally having not depressing thoughts all the time. I got a job in January, but continued basically spending all my free time either stressing about bullshit or reading about the market/looking at charts. At this point, I had begun investing a little money which made it even more interesting. Eventually, around beginning February, I was started to feel back to my normal self somewhat. Still scarred, like not at all ready for love again and scared I will slip back into depression(still have some really low days), but also my interests were coming back, I was having energy again, I was wanting to see/make friends again. 

Now, in March, shit is pretty much back to normal. I now am maybe not as obsessed with the market(some of my other hobbies started to come back like philosophy, tv and movies...I seriously went 6 months without viewing a movie or tv show because I was that depressed lol) but still looking at it every day and actually working on my own SQL project for stock screening. But just wanted to thank this community for proving a catalyst to get me back to normal. I didn‚Äôt need drugs, just needed lots of charts for my smooth brain to enjoy.

Tl;Dr was depressed, this sub helped me."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,For completely different reasons I went through 6 months of this too. I‚Äôm now feeling back to my normal self again also. I think a lot of people went through this. 2020 was rough. So glad you found yourself again!

Go for a walk, ride a bike, play the drums - anything. Just get your heart rate up. It works!!!

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Would be great news for me if Cashapp didn't magically fuck up and steal my shit
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,About time.  The film companies have been driving movie theatres into bankruptcy for years.  They will eventually have to give a break to their cash cows if they want to be able to continue milking them.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"To all the organizations receiving surprise donations from WSB: Buy your animals a couple cheap rocket ship and moon toys, take a quick video, send it back to us for the memes. Do you know how many more donations you‚Äôll get if you play with us??  I want this to happen

E: typo and extra enthusiasm. It‚Äôs fucking amazing the giving back this community is doing, but I want to see the goofy shit getting sent back-and-forth. I 100% Believe that the quality humor here is what sets us apart and I want the Falcons and the Apes to be in it too because they don‚Äôt just deserve tendies, they deserve MORE TENDIES.. just like us <3"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Wsb's ark in the making
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Say what you will,  but the WSB community gives back. Tendies are for sharing with humanity."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This has been amazing this weekend. While hedges are up all night trying to figure out how to scheme and manipulate the markets, we are saving animals. I can‚Äôt wait to see all the good we are going to do in this world with our tendies.

Edit- Me personally will be donating to an organization called AHRC. It literally used to stand for ‚ÄúThe Association for the Help of Retarded Children‚Äù. They still keep the acronym but don‚Äôt call it that anymore. So if you chuckle-fuks are looking to do some good as well as support our memes, this helps out. I imagine every state has some version of it.

https://www.ahrcnycfoundation.org/donate/

I am a caretaker to my disabled sister but this program in NY basically picks her up every day and gives adult disabled adults, who are too old for school, a routine and some jobs such as delivering food for Meals on Wheels. Also gives people like myself some much needed free time during the day to do things for themselves like gambling errrr stonk trading I mean!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"i swear this is funny as shit. on another note, i have not seen a single donation made by these multi billion dollar hedgies but let us some dumb fucks have access to lil stimmy and we already changing the world. i cant wait to see how we reshape it after the moon landing. 

be the change you want to see in the world, the rest will follow"

We are so much more giving and generous than any freakin hedge fund (and also, way funnier). Because we‚Äôre real people and a lot of us want to make a real difference; we don‚Äôt want some sort of Scrooge McDuckian gold vault full of our money like HFs, we want to make our share and use the rest to create a better, more comedic world"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,thats just falcon amazing
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very fascinating bird. I loved watching them during my time in British Columbia.  


Here's a quick fact about their ""Rocket"" speed... 


The Peregrine Falcon is a very fast flier, averaging 40-55 km/h (25-34 mph) in traveling flight, and reaching speeds up to 112 km/h (69 mph) in direct pursuit of prey. During its spectacular hunting stoop from heights of over 1 km (0.62 mi), the peregrine may reach speeds of 320 km/h (200 mph) as it drops toward its prey."

I, however, only have money for GME until MOASS occurs. I personally want to keep bolstering my position to get myself the best chance possible against the shorts.
Once the MOASS has occured & I've received my tendies, then I plan on making charitable contributions.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder if CNBC is gonna mention any of this. Those fuckers are just looking for anything bad to say.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Instead of adopting now, I'm putting any extra cash I have into GME, that way I can buy land for preserves/corridors, and to help with things like this. My money will go a lot further that way, in helping biodiversity and habitat reclimation."

If only TPTB would leave us out of their game of pass the imaginarily large numbers of money around. Some day, maybe.

2021-03-14 15:56:48,wallstreetbets,"STOP Thinking IBorrowDesk is the End All Be All I've seen [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/) used a lot lately in posts discussing short interest. To clarify, this site tracks stock loan availability from *one* particular broker: Interactive Brokers. IBorrowDesk does not include stock loan availability from [the 5 largest brokerage houses in the nation by the number of customers and assets: TD Ameritrade, Etrade, Fidelity Investments, Vanguard, and Charles Schwab.](https://www.brokerage-review.com/online-brokers/largest-brokerage-firms.aspx#:~:text=Biggest%20Brokerage%20Firms&text=%22The%20big%20five%20brokerages%22%20is,%2C%20Vanguard%2C%20and%20Charles%20Schwab.) So you're only getting a very small window into the entire picture.

I felt this needed to be said because it seems like a lot of theses are based around IBorrowDesk data. I'm not saying it shouldn't be used at all, just that it's data should be taken with a grain of salt. It should be used to supplemental existing information and not as the basis for what positions one should take."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,also it does not tell us the total outstanding shares...so we don‚Äôt know when the total available number goes up is that from shorts covering or from them getting more shares to lend out. or same for when it goes down it could just be a fund not allowing their shares to be borrowed. add onto it that this is only one broker and we have a pretty useless datapoint
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been sayin this the whole last week, thank you"

2021-03-14 15:52:37,wallstreetbets,"I UNDERSTAND NOW!!!! (Gamma squeeze in plain English) When the stock goes up, the call option goes up.

They sold a call, so when the stock goes up, they lose money on the call.

They buy just enough stock so that they make exactly as much from the stock as they lose on the call.

So they neither make, nor lose anything.

If delta is .5, then for every $1 the stock goes up, the call goes up 50 cents per share. To break even then, the market maker needs to own 50 shares for every call contract.

If 50 shares go up $1 each, then the market maker makes $50 on the stock, and because delta is .5, they lose $50 on the call contract.

When delta changes to 0.6, the market maker needs to buy 10 more shares so they own 60 shares so they make $60 on the stock when they lose $60 on the contract.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but it also works the other way as we saw last Wednesday. 

Some hedge fund bought puts in GME and then shorted the stock. Price started going down so MM had to sell shares to hedge the puts which made price go down even more, i.e. negative gamma squeeze. And that‚Äôs when the hedge fund bought back to close their position. Profit."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,God this shit is confusing. Me no math good.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This works especially well when many many new contracts are bought in a short period of time
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeaaah you linked to my favorite explanation
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"After months of repeated attempts to inject some knowledge into his brain, the ape u/DougPenhall finally showed signs of progress."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"When?

When do they buy, and when do they sell?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup. A reverse gamma squeeze.

But a gamma squeeze can happen in both directions with only calls.

If and increasing stock price increases delta causing the market maker to have to buy more shares, the reverse is also true. A decrease causes the market maker to sell shares.

And with puts, when the stock price decreases, the puts increase in value, so delta is negative. So if the market maker is short puts, then the MM loses money when the stock price decreases. To compensate for that loss, they need to have an open short position.

So if I‚Äôm understanding correctly, buying puts causes the MM to short the stock, which decreases the value of the stock. And because delta becomes more negative as the stock price declines, the market maker must short more shares causing a further decline in the stock price.

And the reverse applies to puts as well. As the stock price increases, the MM can short fewer shares as delta approaches $0.

This bit about puts and shorting confuses me a bit, so I need some confirmation to be sure I don‚Äôt have it wrong or something. And I‚Äôm wondering if calls and puts both add together or cancel each other.

In other words, are people who are buying puts helping us with the squeeze? Or are they fighting us?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depending on which calls you buy, you can cause the market maker to buy a lot of shares which can drive up the stock price.

They also have to buy shares as the stock price increases in order to remain delta neutral. But, on the flip side, they have to sell shares as the stock price decreases in order to remain delta neutral."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I liked that explanation too. I had been trying to understand this for a while, and it‚Äôs that explanation that finally got me too understand.

That‚Äôs when I thought I should simplify and shorten it. After reading my explanation, I believe/hope that more others will understand the more thorough other explanation."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why‚Äôs it called a gamma squeeze then and not a delta squeeze? Is it cause gamma is the derivative of delta, and the change in delta actually drives the buying?"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok. So when do they sell those shares? Before, after, or when those options expire?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Assuming they havent sold another call for the future
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Usually on mondays
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"They buy and sell shares as delta changes. If delta increases, they buy more shares. If delta decreases, they sell some shares. Their goal it to remain delta neutral for the duration of the contract.

If the contract expires out of the money, then delta will be 0.0 at expiration, which means they would have already sold all the shares before the option expired, which would likely be Friday."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options technically expire on Saturday, so the delta would drop to 0 when the market is closed.

If we take open interest on gme calls and we multiply it by the delta, the MM had 4.4millions  shares on Friday that are free of obligation right now.

But the same calculation for 3/19 is currently around 6 millions of shares.


As long as this volume of shares tied to contracts obligations keeps increasing every week, there is technically no ceiling.


The issues will be if the volume drops and we get an inverse price action.

That's what happened on Friday 29th of January, with mm unloading on the next Monday"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe that delta for OTM calls drops to 0 on Friday. That‚Äôs why OTM calls are worth practically nothing on Friday when the market closes.

In the money call options are typically sold during the week of expiration before Friday, which can create a lot of downward pricing pressure as the market makers become free to sell the shares that they purchased because of those calls."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"On far otm it drops almost to 0 on Friday yes, but you have to consider options very close to the money.

An option that is otm at 4pm can still get ITM in after hours"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but robinhood self attempts to close your expiring positions before market close on Friday, even if that's only finding a buyer/putting in the order for the trade. It's likely other brokerages do similar as well."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Schwab will exercise your ITM options on Friday, and OTM options will expire worthless. This guy claims that you can call and exercise options up to 1/2 hour after the market closes on Friday.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy fucking shit, that's a nightmare scenario."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know, right?

After watching that, I‚Äôve decided never to let my options expire. From now on, I close them before the market closes on Friday."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah.  I guess it's kinda cool that robinhood doesn't immediately close out your dead options at close and let's them linger for a bit. Problem is that they probably have to be right near in the money and Robinhood would be selling it to the lowest bidder, but you could walk away with (presumably) something instead of nothing

Am retarded. I mean specifically for out of the money calls and puts that you bought, not sold."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, in some cases, you might be better off with nothing.

For example imagine you bought $800 GME calls that expire Friday. Then the squeeze happens pushing GME to $801 on Friday April 16, and then your options expire worth $100 because they‚Äôre $1 ITM. You end up with 100 GME shares that you have to pay $80,000 for.

Then, come Monday, and the stock opens at $700 and drops rapidly as the squeeze is over. You‚Äôre now $10,000 in the hole and it‚Äôs quickly getting worse.

You could have recently bought these calls for about $80 per contracts. Right now you‚Äôd be up over 50x. But if you wait until they expire, you‚Äôd be screwed.

A friend bought 3 of these exact call options and his $240 could have been worth $15,000 a few days ago. But, he sold them at a loss because this scenario scared the shit out of him.

I told him to just sell them before they expire, but some dumbfuck posted a comment claiming that my friend might not be able to sell his call options because who the fuck would be dumb enough to buy them?

And my friend didn‚Äôt believe me that the market maker would buy them because they have to. He‚Äôs paranoid and believe that if it‚Äôs possible that he can get screwed, then he‚Äôll get screwed.

So my dumbass friend missed out on a 50x gain on a $240 investment, or $15,000 of gains because he‚Äôs a chickenshit!!!"

The music for today's post is **Gosh** by **Jaime XX**.  Put it on.

I'm your host Brother Luminous and **I want to start this out by saying I'm not a professional, I am not giving financial advice and well you shouldn't listen to anything I say.  Please let me know if I am wrong. I can take it.**

I am so fucking balls deep in this ticker.

**Canoo Inc. AKA $GOEV** is an EV automaker whose claim to fame is developing a highly customizable electric skateboard chassis allowing it to quickly adapt vehicle designs to specific applications with a high degree of customizability. They seek to break the mold by pushing design boundaries while maximizing utility and advancing new concepts in vehicle ownership through subscription based models of vehicle financing and fleet management.  Canoo Inc also excels at punishing the visionary longs as you must wait for 3 months outside the temple of Zen before they let you in **No more suffering GOEV only tendies and gainz posting now.**

# Trend Reversal = No More Dryspell

Recently SPACS and EVs fell out of favor as macro market headwinds took the air out of Tech and Growth sails.  With a large amount of EV's being suspected of being Vaporware including the Pink Elephant in the room TSLA, Capital ran from these stocks faster than your Sunday morning retreat from that pig shaped MOPED you don't want your friends to see you riding.  This all came back to a stunning reversal of fortune after Warren Buffet said Yield Curve is so 1920's and everything is fine, stop being a bitch.  FED said QE forever boys and I'll let you know when I stop buying mortgages people haven't paid for since the pandemic started. Cool Bro, so Last week we saw capital come back to growth and tech stocks acting like nothing happened because they have a nice personality and tend to bang well. You know what I'm mean.

This saw our beloved GOEV take its gloves off (and its pants) and fight like it had a pair.  There's a short squeeze taking place that I have written about extensively.  The stock price immediately reversed its course and has continued to appreciate dramatically based on the electric magnetism of a gamma ramp. Friday the empire struck back and then we gave everyone fuck tons of free money. BullHood and his best friend WeRobbin' is going to turn this market into Burning Man meets 28 days later. Strap in.

For real though Canoo spent this week as the darling of the EV class.  Not only did its [SP](https://u.teknik.io/nkXjb.PNG) outperform every other fucking EV maker out there. If there wasn't the Friday Short shenannigans this week the SP would have dominated them all from the moon.  I believe that we are seeing the emergence of the Tesla Hedge. Canoo is, in my opinion, strategically grabbing market share while staying out of the way of direct competition with luxury EV models. Its doing its own thing.

# Hypermasculine BubbleTruk drop dominates automotive world.

[BubbleTruk](https://u.teknik.io/ikfDb.jpg) was so fucking weird.  People had a strong feeling about it, hating or loving it... No one ignored it. Media has shifted significantly into covering Canoo's Electric Truck Release (Did fisker even do anything at MPG ?)  [Google news overflowing](https://u.teknik.io/44XGk.jpg) with articles in the past 3 days. Probably some pay to play, but whatever.  Check the plenty of articles with titles calling the Bangbus as a TSLA competitor.  That belief will be self fulfilling.  We are currently standing at the base of a significant change in perception [a trend reversal](https://u.teknik.io/4Zo6x.PNG) that will have long lasting positive consequences to valuation.  But competing with Tesla is not the only thing on Canoo's mind, Canoo seeks to corner the entire fucking truck market.  Lets compare.

|**Pussy Magnet Confirmed?**|Dominates|>!I've heard about those. !<|BubbleTruk Throw Back Trim. *Sloppy*.|

**Canoo hasn't been this cool always.**  I watched the MPDV vehicle video and succeeded in not suck starting a pistol but only barely.  In fact, If I was long in GOEV and that video dropped, I would have by now.  Its clear that the CannooBro's fanbase has only survived because of California's strict gun legislation.

I am highly encouraged by Electric ChadTruk video because everything about it was better. The presentation, the lighting the guest, the reality of its presence.  There was something just so dominant about it where Canoo just showed versus explained to me why I should think its cool. Tony talked about taking his significant other out and his Guys on the jobsite.  This offends the westcoast hipster elite.  Listen, the fact that he didn't say ""My arm candy sextoy never drives"" means he's paying attention to the Mandatory Training PowerPoint slides. The MPDV felt like a joke you have to explain... like your portfolio's performance before last Monday.   This level of difference is indicative of serious corporate flexibility and an ability to create meaningful change when you miss your target.  Its not all wins but its how you roll with the punches that matters. 

**Let me put it to you like this, you didn't know you wanted that truck until you saw the video.** 

# That stinks like Steve Jobs. 

**Trend Reversal.**

# No Real  ETF Yet, straight unconcerned.

After being involved in stocks with ETF exposure (read: **Every single other stock out there**)  I can appreciate that we will only be going up versus blaming all of our losses on ""ETF shorting"".  Depending on the catalyst that brings that exposure we could see millions of shares being scooped up. Note the comparable amount of the rest of comparable stocks. Somewhere between Nio and Fisk is 10 percent of our FF.  Just saying.

In other news, Cathie Wood is excited about the Canoo truck because she will finally be able to fit all of Ark's Short Interest in the back without having to fold the seat down.  The only problem is that the 200 mile range might not be enough to find the share price at the bottom of the chart.  She's just a attention grabbing vaporware empty bag holdin... Wait what? What? **Breaking news!** Ark picked us up..

She's a **genius**. Truly visionary with her approach.

( Just to be clear Ark didn't pick us up)... ^(yet)

**Imminent Trend Reversal**

# Monday is Roth , Partner Announcement would be cool.

They could announce something and really just fucking make everyone who boarded this party train in the last 4 days so fucking rich its disgusting or longs break even.  I'm just kidding, they're going to be rich too. Especially people with warrants.  They are going to get the nursing home bed next to the window.

But lets be real and get to know the **bear perspective.**

/u/Dramatic-Trainer-268

""Roth could end up being fruitful, but it'd be the first time they released material info at a conference/round table like this since I started following them And since they revealed the MPDV in Dec they've been stone fucking silent So I worry they're going to drag their feet on providing any new info before 4/16And the only reason I think they'd hold those numbers for an extended period of time is if they weren't as good as they wanted them to be prior to announcing them Few weeks after revealing MPDV and opening up US pre-orders, they opened it up to Canada and Mexico too. Out of the blue. Felt like they wanted to juice the numbers.$100 deposit, fully refundable, so people will hate on them being true pre-orders""

He's actually super bullish and literally knows everything about Canoo Inc.  he just wants you to know that its not all shits and giggles.  I'm wondering about earnings too... Its like were at the action sequence of the movie and we just got done killing the monster, but there's still 30 minutes left in the film.  Nevertheless I'm feeling good.

I want to end with some wild speculation from the man that leaked the ChadTruk in the first place.

/u/PlaneReflection

""I‚Äôm speculating that Walmart will purchase a fleet of MPDVs for Walmart+ deliveries.

* \-Paul B mentioned ‚Äúretailers like Walmart‚Äù several times.
* \-MPDV is the cheapest cargo van, electric or gas, on the market.
* \-MPDV has the greatest cargo volume for its footprint, meaning more deliveries in less trips.
* \-Canoo‚Äôs phone-as-a-key and fleet management software provides much better integration, than any other vehicle.
* \-EVs make sense from a fleet perspective as minimal maintenance, no dealing with gas cards, can charge at Walmart sites and etc.
* \-Canoo Lifestyle vehicle was coincidentally spotted charging at a Walmart in Arizona on [Twitter](https://u.teknik.io/4ImZF.PNG):""

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm fucking in and doubling my number of calls on Monday. That‚Äôs not significant given how bad I got fucked by PLTR calls last month, but I‚Äôm in for the ride. I‚Äôm sad this won‚Äôt get more exposure here given the state of r/apeadoption, but I‚Äôve thrown a few shout outs in the weekend thread (won‚Äôt stop either) just so more people can read your entertaining posts at the very least. I feel like you‚Äôve been honest about the risks in this, and that‚Äôs actually made me bullish as fuck (especially after that huge dip Friday where someone was trying to plug their asshole before getting gaped). Whether this goes tits up or helps me finish recouping my February losses with a play that‚Äôs more entertaining than fucking WFC and WMT, I appreciate the work you‚Äôve put into this. 

I‚Äôm so bullish I‚Äôm breaking my rule of not entering a position immediately at open. As soon as those casino doors swing wide I‚Äôm throwing cash at it and praying we don‚Äôt wipe out before the 1080 attempt on the gamma ramp. If it looks like we ate shit tho I might be out end of the week. I look forward to anything else you do man shit is entertaining as hell."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Canoo leaps are the way
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looking at their chart, and seeing how new they are, I‚Äôm curious: As a bull on them yourself, do you think they bottom out around a lower price point before liftoff, or do you have reason to believe that their current price point IS a reasonable entry point? And I don‚Äôt mean long-term, I mean short term.

Either way, beautiful write-up. I‚Äôm going to open a small position on Monday with intent to increase it as more information comes in and the stock dips. Might even sell some CSPs, the IV is a little higher than I‚Äôd like it to be for me to start purchasing options and there aren‚Äôt LEAPs available yet (since this could be very long term), but all in all it looks like a solid investment."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This almost seems like too good of a play to not actually do it. Thinking about 4/16C @ 17.5 but not sure what‚Äôs the best play
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yo thanks for the hype  üöÇ.  Bull case #5 goes into detail about the thesis and trading strategy.  I'm going to do a post tomorrow morning focused on the new ortex data and understanding what happened Friday (super bullish actually) and discussing some things that need to occur for catalystic action such as we saw with $RKT.  The real key is crossing the threshold of 16 and you can see that the short interest understand this and is willing to get violent... Since  quite a lot of the gamma ramp expires Friday I can expect long sided violence as well... Look for a gap open Monday as confirmation that longs are in it to win it...
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks,

There is some deeper discussion of the bull üêÇ thesis and strategy in edition #5. This chart is currently a battleground, there is nothing about it that is natural other than the grass stacked  over the bear traps.   There's blood everywhere.. A summary of the thesis is 

1 9 million of SI accumulated from a price point of 17ish on down. utilization is 100 so they are out of cheap ammo. 
2. Sudden market turn around caught them off guard limiting their ability to orderly file out without losing money
3. At the time the mpg hadn't happens but catalyst in play will revalue the company (seems like it has on multiple levels)
4. A study of the options ladder reveals intelligent violent intent on  deep pocketed longs who will punish the shorts and cause a squeeze. Sympathetic longs and orc horde retail have joined.
5. Violent intent confirmed on subsequent trading days of gap openings weaponizing the gamma ramp throughout last week


Because the march aspect of the gamma ramp is so energetic I would look to a continuation of the gap openings for Monday and crossing the important @16 dollar line as that's when the Delta of 17.5 wakes up and drags shorts underwater.  I suspect 25 is when they get margin called as the 30s will wake up.  If this happens then I expected to see a RKT like squeeze

Additionally tomorrow at Roth they would be stupid not to announce something to continue positive momentum."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's a lot of theories about it I wrote a silly post about it as my last one but /u/rivaaal [wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3tpkt/canoo_was_algo_attacked_today_probably_to_cover/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb) out the numbers down and is a much more useful read...

Essentially we found a pain point as the fight had been nearing 16 which is a magic number, so a short opened a massive put position, flipped the SI bought a bunch of disgustingly cheap calls and closed them out at the same time. 

This is either a failed campaign to end the longs as the shorts considered this to be another WSB retail campaign which would get scared off and collapse the play but when the longs just removed the backstops and let them start accumulating SI at lower prices the short pressure dried up and we resumed the trend upwards

This also saved them from margin calls as the so at the end of the day was essentially where we started... 

I'll talk about it a bit more in tomorrow's more reading focused post."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shorts playing gme like games

I'm going to do a trading centered post tomorrow explaining my take but /u/rivaaal has written about it in detail..."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was $17 this time last month, and the fundamentals only got stronger. Macro climate aside (which Canoo defied), I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to load up on a dip (if there will be one). I‚Äôm not a financial advisor and can be wrong and stupid."

2021-03-14 12:27:57,wallstreetbets,"GME: A game of Tug O' War You vs the hedgies

If you pull hard enough you get 1000 banana, if they manage to get your grip loose and win, they get your 1 banana. Seems fair because risk vs reward of going against several opponents by yourself balances it out. But it doesn't, the hedgies are using every trick disposable to them to get you to loosen your grip; they let go of the rope for a bit and then let the big fat anchor hedgie pull as soon as you try to gain ground. Yet you do not falter.

Why? Because you are an ape. An ape knows they are not alone in this cause, they simply tighten their grip and HOLD onto their dear lives. The hedgies continue and continue but not a single whiff of your banana is in their grasp. Eventually after all their tricks, their pussy hands are bleeding- they cannot hold on anymore. You pull forward and one by one the hedgies fall and the 1000 bananas they owe are yours...

But you do not let go of the rope. No no, in fact you tighten your grip and HOLD and pull like you've never before. The hedgies have been screwing with you this whole time. All their dirty tricks, you want to make them pay. As you keep pulling the rope, and the last chungus of a hedgie falls, you notice that their rope does not end. In fact it is an endless rope full of bananas along the way. You pull and HOLD and pull and HOLD and you keep getting more and more bananas. 2000, 5000, 10000, 50000, it just keeps going and going. Eventually you take your fill of bananas and decide to leave as a bananillionaire!

You were able to squeeze the hell out of the rope because you knew 1000 was not enough. Because you held, you got many, many more bananas than you thought was possible.

This is not financial advice, I simply like allegories.

Here's the link: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2021/03/09/losing-touch-with-reality--a-gamestop-lesson](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2021/03/09/losing-touch-with-reality--a-gamestop-lesson)

In this article, the author tries to conflate put options with short selling. They claim short selling has an expiration date and that the hedge funds were forced to cover because their put options were expiring.

That isn't how this shit works.

I've only just started trading options, but even \*I\* know if you buy put options you're only risking the premium you pay. If the stock moons, your options just expire worthless and you're out the premium that you paid.

How in the nine hells of journalistic malpractice did this actually get published?

The author then says the trading activity was all bots and that social media is a threat.

Author is the CEO of some cloud bullshit who has no clue about investing or options gambling.

Here's the tweet they sent out: [Forbes on Twitter: ""Losing Touch With Reality ‚Äì A GameStop Lesson https://t.co/msQlQleVqI"" / Twitter](https://twitter.com/Forbes/status/1370993131592814601)

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"> As a population, we have a pretty good handle on malicious email activities, but bot activity must be brought into check now  especially in online forums and social media. There seems to be a lack of will by companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit to do so.  With a lack of measures to assure a genuine base of users, trolls and opportunists will leverage any crack possible to jump into the stream and corrupt conversations to their needs. Every account should be validated and traced to an actual individual and in obvious cases, an actual business or organization. What we are seeing is the product of nothing but purposeful neglect and a gap in the mission of what online interactions were built for. 

Hmm so the author thinks the problem is a ""genuine base of users"" with today's social media platforms. I wonder if right now in this moment we would somehow link the real person's ID into their profile here, how many of the people here making deep DDs, stupidly clever memes and comments would turn out to be REAL people. And how many of the very obvious shills and copy-and-paste bots we see lurking around would turn out to be bought profiles from the same IP address...

So yeah there is a problem of authenticity, but not to the direction this asshole here thinks it is."

Im just baffled and truly amazed how this saga has continued when there has been ample opportunity for these guys to stop it all together. They could have exited during the first run up and eaten their losses. They could have unwound when we dropped back to the 40s, they could have just taken their lumps and be done.

What's authentic about anyone in the news or on any show? At the end of the day, they are all trying to sell you something, a product or narrative. That's exactly what this joker is doing, and why the hive mind of reddit is a threat. We can individually piece together information and facts, to deconstruct false narratives.  We are a standing army against propaganda, if and when we so choose. An army with backgrounds and educations so diverse, you can't build something like this. It has to be on a volunteer basis. It has to be authentic. WSB is like a grass roots movement of individuals from across the globe, with independent thoughts, ideas and goals, utilizing technology, information, and financial instruments, to beat the pros at a game they designed to box us out of.

They are scared because all these people are utilizing a complex set of skills in mass, that no generation prior has had the ability to. From social media to information and data analysis, utilization of online trading platforms, historical information and spread sheets, meams and meam culture, propaganda awareness, putting the abriviation etc at the end of a sentence, when you run out of ideas, etc. All while making jokes about being retarded, and yelling no ape left behind.

These people would never give us a dollar. They think we are less than them, and they are terrified of us. Why? Because we are the revolution. We aren't going to go out in the streets and protest, because that's to much like work. Fuck that! We're going to sit on our couches playing Xbox, while using their weapons against them in a law abiding fashion.

Synthetic shares (long call + short put) are also tied into equity markets and have an effect in prices.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even if you ignore those, there's still a lot of puts  with significant delta exposure and they outnumber the calls. If the stonk goes up more, MMs will buy shares to trim their hedges on puts and buy shares to hedge their short calls. 

Look up Net Options Pricing Effect. Derivatives markets, when exposure gets large enough, affects the underlying dramatically. Same thing happened in '08 (GFC), '18 (Volmageddon), '20 (TSLA/EV gamma squeeze)"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you think they will sell millions of put contracts without hedging? What if the stock crashes and they owe a shit ton of money?

No, they short shares to hedge their exposure. Right now P/C ratio is very high even when you filter out the $1 puts. The OI with meaningful amounts of delta will have an effect on the underlying when the stock moves."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You're missing the point? Sorry but I don't feel like arguing. Wish you the best
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,so what's your point? what does it mean according to you
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course they're going to hedge. If the author had talked about that you would have a point. They didn't.

Did you even read the article?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You are missing the point. Go place that trade in an options analyzer. The exposure is literally identical to a short share.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I was watching the TSLA options chains last fall I would often see P/C ratios of around 3x to 4x before the stock mooned. It acts kind of like a coiled spring, when P/C ratio gets high and  too many people get net short, people run for the exit and buy them back to cover (MMs buy back their hedges) . Likewise with a very low P/C ratio, it tends to be mean reverting. 

Of course this isn't the only variable. But it is gasoline that will amplify movements one way or another."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The OP is missing crucial some pieces of information. You think it's fair to ignore the effect of delta hedging?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,TL;DR: hodl?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The article didn't talk about literally ANY of that.

The author of the article treats buying puts as if it's short selling. He literally says they had put options expiring and were forced to buy stock at a huge loss because of their put options.

Then he says it's all bots, social media is evil and used by terrorists to manipulate markets. Here are some direct quotes...

> Many at Wall Street hedge funds were caught in short selling positions, having to cover the differences in prices between the low price they bet on in their ‚Äúput‚Äù options, and the actual price as their options were set to expire.

> When the short sales options became due and the price did not match expectations, the hedge funds who expected to win lost big.

> The openness of the social media platforms to malfeasance is a persistent issue. It is difficult to ascertain safety and authenticity when engagements on many platforms are completely anonymous and unauthenticated. Who is a friend? Who is a foe? Or the equally important question‚Äîwho is a bot and part of a bot farm in an effort to manipulate results? Bot farms exist, and are sponsored not only by criminal enterprises but also by state-actors.

> Bots and bot-based activity are a significant threat to not only the personal privacy and security of the average person, but also the valuation of well-known companies like GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, etc. The public is engaged in a virtual congregation and exchange of information that could literally be anybody, from anywhere or any automated program. These bots open the door to threats that include:

> State-sponsored economic terror

> Foreign intelligence gathering

> Economic and political influence

> Fraud

> Cybercriminal activity

> Market manipulation

> Narrative shaping

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,YES üíé üôå I LIKE THE STOCK
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Well that guy is an idiot. But buying puts does put a net short in the market. The buyer himself doesn't own that short but it's out there and it affects the movement of the underlying.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've had this idea for a long time, but with all of amateur primatologists who are about to become extremely wealthy, now seems like the best chance I'll ever have to execute it.

I want to teach bonobos sign language. Not just one or two, but a whole tribe of them. I want to release them back into the wild and see what they do with their newly acquired gift of language. Why bonobos? They're basically chimpanzees that don't cannibalize their neighbors. They sit around getting drunk on fermented fruit and have the sort of orgies that would make Hollywood-era Nancy Reagan blush, but they are largely peaceful.

So here's my proposition: let's fund schools in the jungle to teach our cousins to talk to one another. Adoptions are important, but I think we're all ignoring the value of a good education. If we can get them to use smartphones, in ten years from now we could have a whole new generation of apes buying GME."

I will never get sick of these adoption posts. Ever single one releases a tiny drop of the stress I have been carrying my whole life about the fate of our planet, forests, oceans and animals.... üíöüåéü¶ç. 

Anyone who slanders WSB can suck a knob! THIS is what good people do when they come into excess $$$$. The GameStop play has allowed everyday people to shift a little bit of the massive wealth that has been HOARDED by Billionaires. Billionaires have accumulated $$$$ NOT by adding value to the world but by sequestering $$$ from people, from govt, from the exploitation of the earth, and taking more for themselves than they deserve. The wealth of billionaires comes at the expense of human health and environmental health. As they get richer as the planet gets sicker..... BUT you know what happens when people who have a shred of conscious and good hearts get a scoop of that money? -they put some of it back to HELPING the land- adopting apes cause it‚Äôs cool! ü¶çü¶çü¶ç

The wealthy elite would delight in seeing that last remnants of health and diversity on earth be converted into a few final digits in their bloated bank accounts. üíî

The way I see it: by foiling them a bit with GME, and ‚Äòadopting‚Äô these animals, WSB is Reallocating some of the stolen wealth/health of he world BACK into forests, BACK into land, diversity, and healthier balanced ecosystems. Back to the places that were ravaged to generate $$$ for those at the top in the first place... there are those that would covert the whole world, forest, oceans, and humanity into $$$ yet here we are converting $$$ back into planetary health.

‚ÄúTo date, over 200 rangers have been killed protecting Virunga and its surrounding communities, the highest fatality rate for any protected area on earth.  

The upsurge in violent attacks and the killings of park staff has left Virunga in an enormously difficult situation going into the new year. Protecting a national park in a region afflicted by decades of conflict has become all the more difficult with the successive challenges of the 2018-19 Ebola epidemic and now the 2020-21 COVID-19 pandemic, exacerbated by the ongoing loss of the entire revenue from tourism since March last year. 

As we try our best to navigate these uncertain waters, our conviction to protect the park and its surrounding communities is resolute. Through it all, Virunga rangers remain the frontline of defense in ensuring the park‚Äôs long-term survival. 

Despite the risks, these brave men and women show up everyday to preserve one of the planet‚Äôs last remaining biodiversity hotspots for future generations. Even in these dark times, the Park is lucky to have some constant friends. The European Union and GWC have once again stepped up to support Virunga and will double match any donations to the Park in the aftermath of the attack on the 10th January. So today, we have a request of you: we need your help to ensure that Virunga survives and the sacrifices of our Rangers are not in vain. Knowing the unprecedented times through which we are all living, Virunga is humbled by any support that you can give. We know the only way forward is together and thank you for being a part of our team.‚Äù

1) Every person is donating BECAUSE they are interested in GME. They are not going to forget about the MOASS because they got so distracted by their newly adopted monkey friend. We've all been staring at the ticker for weeks and that won't change any time soon.

2) ""The money could have been used to buy GME"" - yes, but $60 is not going to break the bank and you can assume anyone giving money can afford it.

If you want to help animals that truly are in need, the ASPCA is an amazing organization.  They rescue abandoned and abused animals and give them the care that they deserve.  You‚Äôll get a membership card and some swag, and you can also claim it as a donation when doing your taxes.

I've seen the great work many charities do. I've worked with orphaned Orangutans. These charities work tirelessly and often have barely any resources.

Animals are vulnerable, exploited, frightened. With these donations you're doing your bit to reduce that. To each individual animal, that makes a huge difference, it's life changing.

Not only would this be great ammo against the media disinformation about the sub and the degenerates in it but it might also encourage others to donate some of their tendies to those in need if they want to. There could even be annual charity drive goals if it became something popular.

Animal wildlife is one of the most illegally shorted stocks on the fucking planet. Do you think naked short-selling should be illegal? what these people are doing is straight up a crime. They don't borrow animals to short them, they literally steal them, and because they never return anything this basically reduces the float, and then when they sell it costs even more. literally *shorting* the stock. I would not be surprised if shitadel, Melvin, and Vlad were regular customers. ^(for legal purposes, this is a joke and I'm not suggestion nor accusing any of them of being involved in poaching)

Enter Wildlife Funds. They are not like the Funds we usually talk about. What they do is HOLD the animals literally NEVER Sell. You are afraid paper hands will let you down and drop the price? Not with these funds. 100% diamond-handed like none of us.

**Are you too late for the squeeze?**

Well, are the animals still being shorted? Of course it's not fucking late. The squeeze is not over until they are out of extinction lists and every poacher gets to jail. This is the longest squeeze of history. higher than gme multiplied by vw.

Why help us raise funds for this documentary? Because Harambe's story deserves to be told and so that another similar event that led to his death never happens again. 

Through the lens of Harambe's life, the documentary will help us to better understand what really happened that tragic day. 

Almost five years ago, his death moved millions and sparked an international outcry for animal welfare. Now, years later we still need to ask: How we can better protect and preserve endangered species to create a better future for gorillas as their populations continue to decline? ü¶ç

This documentary will explore the complicated topic of endangered animals in captivity as we follow Harambe‚Äôs official photographer, Jeff McCurry as he goes on a journey to meet others who were involved the day Harambe died.

Your contributions will help us finalize the movie and open the doors for broader distribution to fully tell this important story. We all can pay homage to Harambe by making sure his story is told by those who loved him and knew him the best.   

We need your help to make this happen.

Be part of our story! Add your name to the credits supporting the documentary‚Äôs creation, with as little as $25. üéû

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm really suspicious of these adoption posts right now. I am seeing the same gorillas over and over again, all that changes is the name of the donor.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,We‚Äôve been keeping tattoo places going for the past year. No one gives us credit for that.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"History teacher here, hello! No offense to anybody who watches news, but that format is pretty much dead. And like any former great thing and its death spiral throughout time, toward the end they get a little desperate in crazy. They are shooting for the lowest common denominator and the shock factor, and our long gun with being happy and wholesome.

That being said, just cuz someone doesn't see what you do that is good, doesn't make it any less good. :-)"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"They get paid to ""influence"" retail sentiment. I have a hard time understanding your point. Their job isn't to be unbiased and report. They steer your opinion.                

You wouldn't like it if you hired a contractor to tear town a piece of property only to find that he has started to fix it.     

It might look better but it isn't the job.       

So no. They won't report on the positive side of WSB because! that's simply not their job.

Yeah, which is why this is all a little sus.

Just a liiiiiiiittle strange that right as tens of millions of people are getting $1400, that on a sub that has been instrumental in the rise of GME, suddenly there is a massive push to donate that money instead of, I dunno, it going to what it logically would have gone for (buying more GME).

""But think of all the good publicity,"" some might say.

*Except the media doesn't report on the good things the sub does.*

So yeah.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I adopted a momma Gutangara and Inanariboniye for my family. My grandpa and I always watched Gorillas in the Mist when I was growing up and I was spending the night with him. This really struck a chord with me once I saw it was the Dian Fossey foundation. My family hasn‚Äôt been in a position to really just donate money for some time. As soon as I saw  it I instantly just knew it was a good decision. I didn‚Äôt have any second thoughts about that money, tendies or no tendies. This community has provided my wife and I with a lot of hilarious content and I love you guys for it.

Also, if only 120,000 of the 9mil+ of WSB donated just $50 to Dian Fossey, we could reach their normal annual funding number. I think it‚Äôs half of that for OFI."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is really important. I was actually wondering how legit most of these oeganizations are. Does anyone know? A post could be helpful describing which places are good and bad
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,That is so true and good majority of people don't think about that. Most founders/owner/ceo or coo make hundreds of thousands dollars because of donations. I mean yeah it is a nice gesture and the good thing to do but anytime I think about donating I always as for a layout of how my donation will be distributed. I have seen on the tv often when they advertise looking for donations they usually have someone who is wealthy promoting the charity foundation and often wonder if the perdon in the commerial also donates to the cause. I learned from a very wealthy friend of mine when he got a phone call and he asked them to send him a layout of where every penny goes.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also keep the receipt. If in america. The government allowed claiming of 300 of charitable contributions without itemizing for 2020 and will probably do the same for 2021. If you do itemize you are going to want to have them anyways.

Remember the government is going to want some of your tendies no matter what so do what you can to lessen that burden next april. I'm a newer tax preparer but I know enough to give tax advice."

Now the manatees are dying in massive numbers. It's very heart breaking seeing their skeletons everywhere I'm almost in tears thinking about it. 
Nope. In tears. Good choice friend."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Their population numbers have actually rebounded significantly from the lows in the early 90s. There were around 1500 back then, it's up to near 5000-6000 today. A bit lower from the highs recorded a couple years ago, but still a great improvement."

In short, there's a good chance EUR/USD change will have bigger effect to my account before market open, and I'm sure as hell not yoloing everything I own into any one stock anyway."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tonya is from the fund, not me.

Maybe it comes from Revolut?"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I have no idea to be honest. I opened WSB and saw the hot filled with donations for animals and FOMOd in. No regrets.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Not if us apes keep them safe from the wolves.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"First of all: THERE IS NO WE. If you want to invest your money, go for it. I may or may not buy a few shares on Monday. Might be GME, might be silver. That's my choice. Everyone else do their own.

Second, 250$ donation is probably less than the change in EUR/USD in my account before market open. This donation is completely disconnected from my investment portfolio.

Third, be responsible. If you cannot afford to donate to a charity, how can you afford to do extremely risky investments? If anything, this charity run is Zahavian signalling showing that we are prepared to burn through our money for a cause we deem worthy."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or,  cut down in meat, and only eat meat from ethical sources. In the UK, that would be from locally run farm shops, invasive species such as muntjac deer and grey squirrels, or heritage breed species such as Tamworth pigs that are being used in rewilding projects. Facebook pages such as 'Giving up the Game' pair people up with  hunters who have an excess of meat from animals culled through responsible means. Usually the meat is free, because it would otherwise have gone to waste.

If you do plan on becoming vegetarian, please bare in mind the importance of eating locally sourced food. A lot of ingredients used in meat and diary substitutes also damage the environment. Make sure almonds, soya, avocados and palm oil in particular are from sustainable resources. If it's not from a plant or animals native to your area, double check!"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate your charitable efforts. Those are always a positive to the world.
I, however, only have money for GME until MOASS occurs. I personally want to keep bolstering my position to get myself the best chance possible against the shorts.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Funny that donation posts came at same time with the stimulus check. Better you invest into the stocks in the first place and donate more after the squeeze
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,That one was already adopted earlier.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seems like FUD to me. Donate to good causes after you make a ton on the GME short squeeze.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"He told everyone here to sell at 400, so he's still getting the last laugh.







Which is why we must get it higher than 400"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed.  Him ape get dozen bananas
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"sponsors\* ishimwe aint owned by nobody and especially isnt owned by Jim Cramer's tears, he owns them"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol what? Shouldn't you only be able to adopt one? Are they pulling a scam?

As long is the money is helping out all the gorillas I suppose."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,An ape can have many ape friend sponsors
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Theres only a certain number of animals you can ""adopt"", you can adopt one of them multiple times. These are not bots"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,He probably takes the time off to trade on GME. He knows this is the play of the decade.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,No dumbass sold at 400. The paper hands sold when it dropped from the shorters manipulation.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Just like everyone who trades fractionals.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What kinda ass backwards world would we live in if we were apes out here owning other apes? The only thing I wanna own is GME and AMC

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was a little surprised too. But I guess it makes sense. When I went to the site I noticed that there were only like half a dozen or so, and I remember thinking, ""damn! They gonna run out of gorillas to adopt!"" And it was only like $60, so I mean that's not enough to provide for Ishimwe for very long. In reality I'm sure your money goes to all of them."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you ""adopt"" you're actually paying to cover the expenses required to care for the animal for a set period of time (normally 1 year). At least that's how it used to work in my experience. So make no mistake, what is happening here is fantastic. It's putting a lot of these sanctuaries in much better financial health than they usually are, even possibly setting some up for years."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see your point, but this is helping actual apes and more live better lives NOW, because who knows where they‚Äôll be in the future. These organizations have already been hurting because of all the lockdowns, so this is like a godsend to them. For us this is also the best kind of publicity, which should attract the best kind of people that‚Äôll also want to join WSB and put their own foot forward to save some apes or what have you, even those that may not wanna jump into the market.

Moreover, this is probably the most progressive, reasonable sub I‚Äôve ever been on, so anything like this was not intended to create offence.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not at all suspicious. You really think Shitadel and friends want to see us save animals?? Hell no. They wanna get their media buddies to point at us and call us a bunch of greedy, good-for-nothing‚Äôs. It‚Äôs better we donate now than later to help these organizations so that when the meme stonks do explode, they have nobody to point at but their own greedy asses, plus we‚Äôll have made friends in these organizations that‚Äôll stand with us (some already are). I hate to be so practical because this is a really good thing WSB is doing, but you can‚Äôt see past the money aspect, tho you should, because this is all around good for the animals, the organizations, and ourselves via publicity"

You honestly think they actually like that stuff??? No way in hell, because they know they‚Äôre not the only ones seeing this stuff. They know this is how we suck people in. That‚Äôs why they get their media friends to try and push people away from meme stonks. That‚Äôs why Cramer goes on tv mocking us. What you have to understand is that publicity plays a huge roll in this. It‚Äôs how WSB got so huge in the first place

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt bother arguing with him. Just look at his comment history

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did... I really thought I could change his mind, but damn this guy is committed to being a Grade A shill. I‚Äôm definitely done now. Thanks for looking out"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Of course it‚Äôs not a coincidence. It‚Äôs simply a good act and a good idea but you‚Äôre too money-minded or just plain stubborn to realize it. Truly sad
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,No worries I tried to do the same and I kept getting the same responses over and over. He‚Äôs been doing this for hours lmao
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is too coordinated. My apes, you are smart enough to see that this is a new action of HF.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"True, and it‚Äôs pretty impressive ü§£ Only problem is that he‚Äôs probably gonna keep doing it for days or even weeks. I guess it‚Äôs safe to say that we lost this ape to greed"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I reported it as spam. They seem active in the GME sub and that place has devolved into a cesspool of conspiracy the last few weeks. I left that sub a while back. Lots of Qanon type behavior in there
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good idea. There‚Äôs a ton of tinfoil hats in the GME sub for sure, but there‚Äôs also some really great DD there too, some of which doesn‚Äôt make it to WSB. I‚Äôm a bit of a fighter as you can see so I‚Äôll do the sifting, but no doubt it‚Äôs been getting harder recently. Too bad for the shills that I keep my üíéüôå ready for a fight so I tell them to bring it on ü§ú"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh definitely. I check in there every few days to see if there‚Äôs any new info that doesn‚Äôt make it here but I‚Äôm no longer active on there. We‚Äôre goin to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

2021-03-14 11:53:00,wallstreetbets,"PSA: Why You Shouldn't Buy Fractional Shares Fractional shares are a recent trick brokerages have have used to entice people with small amounts of money to invest in the stock market. There are a couple reasons why you may not want to buy them:

(1) Fractional shares don't have voting rights. 

     You might ask, ""why should I give a shit?"" Well, for example, if you are invested in GME right now, there is an annual shareholders meeting coming in June and there will be very important measures that will be voted on then. Your vote, no matter how small, can have an effect on the company's future in the coming years. 

(2) You are giving instituions money to buy shares to loan out to hedge funds who want to short. 

    You heard that right. Fractional shares are backed by real shares held by some institution somewhere. You think they will let those shares sit there? Fuck no, they will loan them out so they can get that juicy 1% interest on money they didn't even put down in the first place. 

TL;DR: Buy a whole share if you can and exersice your shareholder rights and screw the ü©≥

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This seems like somebody trying to stop people with less money buying shares.
Buy fractional shares if that's what you can afford, half a share at squeeze is still a lot of money.
This guy sounds like a hedgie strategy to me"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your really missing the point of fractional shares, there for people that can't get a full share. If you keep buying fractionals you can work your way up to a share. I really think this post is putting a shitty light on something that isn't bad, let people buy what they can and don't accost them for not being able to buy more."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you want to exclude people with less money from participating the journey? How do you think it makes a difference in voting if I own 10 shares or 100 shares or just 0.1 shares of some dozens of millions of shares?

Many institutional players will lend their shares. Why not? If I had the possibility to lend them out and reclaim them at the worst timing for HFs, I definitively would!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You understand that if no shares are lent out to shorts there can't be a short squeeze right?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought a fractional share by accident (fat thumbs press the wrong button). I‚Äôve been holding onto it only because it‚Äôs GME.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fractional shares allow people with a few hundred dollars own stuff like GOOG, AMZN, TSLA, etc. The kinds of companies that small investors otherwise would not be able to buy shares in. It‚Äôs because of the fractional shares that TSLA went to the moon in the late 2019 and then after the March 2020 crash.

It‚Äôs fractional shares and commission-free trades that created this crazy overinflated market where stimulus checks intended for helping people pay their mortgages, rents, and other bills are instead invested in highly speculative stocks. 

If you have $500 in your investment account, and every trade costs you $19.95 to execute, you are not going to be day trading."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This. It‚Äôs utter cod‚Äôs about fractional shares and voting rights. Not as much right as full/whale holders, obviously. But for every whole share held by fractional investors, is one less on the HF‚Äôs grasp."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"So when u buy fractional shares do they all come from the same place? Otherwise, if u bought 0.5 share from company X and then 6 months later 0.5 share from company Y, which one gives up their share to u when u get to 1? If this isn‚Äôt how this works then I‚Äôm assuming if u switch brokerage then u have to close out all fractional shares or leave them behind in the existing account?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I understand the point of fractional shares dude.

But it makes way more sense from a shareholder rights perspective for a company to split its stock rather than offer fractional shares. 

People think a stock split and fractional shares are the same thing but they are not. If you own 0.5 of a share in a brokerage you do not get voting rights on it and you do not get paid borrow interest on it.

Governance is a crucial part of stock ownership, so it would make a lot of sense for a company like GME to split its stock than leave it alone, unless they really don't want the avg retail investor to have a voice in the company."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stimulus is $1400. Anyone can easily afford a share of GME. 

My post is totally educational. Fractional shares can be good if your goal is to average into buying whole shares. But leaving fractions at this time, especially >0.5 shares, is basically giving extra fodder for the shorts and is robbing you of a vote. By the time the shareholder meeting comes it'd make sense to try to complete the share."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes but you won't be squeezing anybody. Keep DCAing to get past at least 1 share so you can vote!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. But the fractions won't help squeeze the stock. 

Also, the stimulus check is $1400. Can afford to buy most stocks with it, especially GME. IMO it's worth paying up go buy whole shares and vote at the shareholder meeting so GME can go to the moon."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. You do not have voting rights over fractional shares (the remainder. So if you have 13.3 shares, you only have 13 votes). I don't even know if Cash App gives you an option to vote. 

I cannot tell you whether or not a specific broker is lending out the shares that are backing the fractional shares, but I don't see why they wouldn't. You don't have the same rights over them as you would traditionally with integral shares. 

It might not seem like a big deal but since there millions of people buying these things it really adds up."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,If you complete your shares and call them back it will put a lot of pressure on those who are currently short
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,In the aaaaarms ooooof an aaaaangel......
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,*Finally*. Where my fellow r/vegan apes at?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Still not enough. And too late.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fractional shares have zero voting rights. Also, the holder of the whole shares can lend them out to shorts.

If you have >0.9 of a share it makes sense to just complete the fraction. If your current position is 1.9, doing so would double your vote and take an extra share away from the shorts."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Brokers that offer fractionals are the ones your buying it from they buy full shares and let their customers purchase a peice of the pie
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The company doesn't offer fractional shares it's a broker that dose......and you say you understand.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,">Stimulus is $1400. Anyone can easily afford a share of GME.

I get what you're trying to say, but if someone can not afford 1 full share of GME right now, then they probably should not YOLO their $1400 Stimmy into GME. I'm all for degeneracy, FDs, and YOLO plays. But at a certain point you have to prioritize a roof over your head, keeping the lights on, and literally food and water.

Some people just want to be a part of the ""game"" and learn along the way without dropping much money. I'm all for fractional shares if that's what you can afford right now."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It come off as fractional shares bad just stop being poor IMO

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a system where I put on about 10 stock positions every morning and I need them to have approximately the same capital in each so fractional shares are great I can allocate an equal amount of capital to each position with very little commissions

* Stock is crazy hyped. Mainline that stimmy money plus Cathie Wood continuing to buy so why in the fuck have I been jerking off and not buying. My wife‚Äôs boyfriend is very disappointed in me.
   * Shares entry \~$25ish
   * Short Term Calls for YOLO sake

&#x200B;

**RKT ‚Äì thanks to** u/bosshax **for his** [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m496ec/gme_and_rkt_short_selling_not_allowed_on_td/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**. This ape appreciated the photos**

* Still a huge short position in this company with many expecting another squeeze
* TD Ameritrade is not allowing for short positions of GME or RKT at this time so all the bears can get fucked
* THE FUCKING TICKER IS RKT!?!? üöÄüöÄüöÄ
   * Shares entry \~$25
   * Short Term Calls are fucking cheap

&#x200B;

**UWMC ‚Äì** u/itsguud [posting](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0j402/uwmc_most_shorted_with_0_shorts_available/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) **was the main thing that got my rocket started**

* Maybe the wholesale ultimatum doesn't mean shit to RKT but it at least seemed like some petty shit I was down with. Could be a big swing in price either way with those going into effect 3/15
* Being listed on new indexes on March 22
* Short interest seems to be around 11%
   * Low entry price \~$9 a share so could have for a longer hold to see if anything pops

&#x200B;

**MVIS - intrigued from** u/mrbrightsied [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4mfm1/potential_inevitable_mvis_buyout/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

* Latest earnings call had the CEO talking about synergic alternatives including a sale of the company
* MVIS's LiDAR product is in MSFT's Hololens being hyped as the potential tech that allows for self-driving cars to be propelled to the forefront
* Jumped 40% last week in share price
* Bullish outlook on call pricing even 5 months out

Edit 1: going to bed now I‚Äôll reply to any comments in the morning!

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Remember $UWMC has the big catalyst tomorrow 3/15 with the ultimatum signing. Companies that do business w UWM have to sign an agreement NOT to do business with $RKT by tomorrow. Could either be a MASSIVE upside or a MASSIVE downside. I got some 3/19 $12.5 calls out there for the gamble and news is looking good for UWMC so far but we'll see Monday AH as well as Tuesday what it's looking like. Either way I like both stocks as I cashed out on the RKT $40 moonshot
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,UWMC all the way

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here but I don't mind holding it for the gains.

Whoever claimed this is absolutely stupid. During the entirety of the week, calls were *never* $0.001. I know this, because I've been watching the options chain the entire week.

Trading halts have a tendency to cause weird UI glitches in brokerage apps due to them attempting to display a ""mark"" price while no trades are being processed. (The bid ask spreads also look way larger than they are.)

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"And you could never have bought his contract for $1 ($0.01 is on a per share basis). They never traded at that price. At the very lowest point, his contracts were likely worth around $3k per pop."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"On my way to that, just sounds terrible waiting for your shares to move over"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"They were never 1 cent. Even at a share price of $170 they were still worth a good $3k per contract, but pricing doesn‚Äôt show during those halts.  Extremely smooth brains in these parts."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,what did you notice in the options chain on a weekend?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,No stimulus check for me. The only stimulus on tap for me this weekend  is the wife‚Äôs boyfriend is coming over to Netflix and chill. Hoping I can listen in from the den.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You also know whats fucked up too? You have a REAL job that requires an actual skill. You know what those guys do? Read. They read charts and graphs for a system that was beaten by a monkey throwing darts, they read charts and graphs for a system that no longer has any logic to it anymore.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Aye, my zoo didn't have an English class."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I saw it with my own eyes, just prior to one of the trading halts the contracts had dropped to a penny, they went absolutely haywire. People were unloading them at market price, and someone scooped it up for .001 , I sat there during the halt staring at a portfolio that had been cut in half in the blink of an eye."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"That wasn't a short attack moron, that was a halt so robinhood wasn't displaying the correct option value. It happens on every halt in robinhood. 

The price never actually dropped to 0.001"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It wasn‚Äôt option chain. Lol I was on robinhood when I noticed this. I had candle chart selected and usually don‚Äôt. I bet everyone who has an option contract in robinhood would see the same thing (plz don‚Äôt say shit using rh.. I didn‚Äôt have choice.. I def hate rh more than anyone). 
But for some reason clicked on an option I‚Äôm holding. If you change chart to weekly chart, hold down the longest candle, the low for the contract says $.01 so everyone‚Äôs options went to $.01 Wednesday.. at least on RH... if I pull the same chart on webull, the bottom of the candle on 3/10 doesn‚Äôt drop below $100. I bitched robinhood out bc if my account if anywhere near $25k, my other calls all of a sudden go to .01 value. Lol I literally have screen shots showing the option before mine and after mine show $2.00 and $1.80 and then mine in the middle at $.01 and not a single option has any volume that day. Not that I would trade anything I‚Äôm holding... but what if I wanted to say trade or not worry about trading restrictions... or if I didn‚Äôt know how shitty RH platform was... that might have influenced me to sell my position if I thought it was accurate. 

It‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve noticed stuff on robinhood that I don‚Äôt think they intended people to see. For example the massive sell orders for like $5, $10, $15, and so on when a stock trades for like $110. I posted something a while back somewhere and now you can‚Äôt see those type of orders on the level 2 data. but then I noticed on webull they are still there... the line highlights but no numbers actually show up. 

If you‚Äôre looking at option chain.. I did notice Thursday night tho... there were a lot of call options with 0 open interest but had volume... and then massive amounts of put options. Lol I almost fell for it. Don‚Äôt fall for it. And if you‚Äôre looking at options to buy, but far itm... otm won‚Äôt have normal option gains to make it work buying otm."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"To defend other careers... just because all you do is read doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not skillful. Decision making is certainly an actual job and is hard.

I only recognize physical labor as ‚Äúreal jobs‚Äù, I‚Äôm working on this"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"To add to this -- my ape-mate is also a college professor. But when ape-mate was in grad school, ape-mate was asked by one of the faculty in his program to come up with a way to predict a particular aspect of the market. (Ape-mate doesn't work on finance at all -- ape-mate is just good at computer modeling.) Ape-mate and faculty member worked at a start-up, and ape-mate came up with a method that was highly effective at predicting this thing. Ape-mate and faculty member's start-up got a buy-out offer from an organization that supplied info to HFs, and ape-mate got an offer to sit pretty in a corner office, holding hedgies' hands and explaining the information. Ape-mate ultimately refused the offer and went into a regular (low-paying) faculty job because -- I kid you not -- the people he had to talk to on the phone  (HF bigwigs) all the time were truly unbearably stupid and he couldn't imagine having to explain things to silver-spoon HF idiots for the rest of his life.  He would get off the phone all the time disgusted with how hard it was to explain to them what to do. You couldn't even lead them to water.  They were so dense and inept that, invariably, he would start out by giving them the predictive information, realize that they were utterly lost and about to make the opposite moves of what the information suggested they should, and he'd end up telling them what precise market move to make because they couldn't even make the connection between the information he was giving them and the correct market move.

TLDR: Hedgies so dumb."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Their jobs do require skills but it also requires lack of ethics which should be shunned not praised.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are evolving, ape"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"They weren‚Äôt actually trading though. The bids and asks get wiped away in those halts. When there is either no bid or no ask for a given contract, RH will show them as $1 per contract (or .01 per share). Saw it with my own eyes as well and tried desperately to buy even at much higher bids but they simply weren‚Äôt trading"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah they weren‚Äôt traded. If it was $1 I would have bought thousands. Robinhood is a shitty platform that likes to manipulate people. Any other broker would give you the last cost.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,everything that works against them is a short attack bro
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,lol rh UI is the cleanest but when it comes to options trading i noticed this shit all the time. And I dont just mean the low OI. Also did you consider the fact that the halts probably gave the spread some fucky numbers for a little?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"God I'm so happy I don't carpent and do any sort of construction anymore. Working from home is where it's at. No wonder so many blue collar guys are angry as they get older, they peak at 30/hr by the time they're 30-50 years old, and their falling apart. I had zero patience after a 12 hour day remodeling a house or doing QA testing on commercial sites. It just fucking sucks and makes your grouchy af at the end of the day. And Fox News is waiting for you to tell you who to be mad at for your troubles"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,He should have asked for more money and an assistant to buffer him from them.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah during halts no one is trading. So really it should say ‚Äú$0.00‚Äù, but ‚Äú$0.01‚Äù is the lowest it can go.

I‚Äôm guessing if someone sells at market price, they could get screwed and sell at 0.01 when trading resumes, but that‚Äôs an outlier and not really what the contract is worth.

Even the $800 3/12 were worth more than $0.01 until late 3/12"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm all for shitting on Robinhood, but please don't spread misinformation. There's no way to place a market order for options on Robinhood, you can only buy and sell using limits."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs good to know, I‚Äôve been out of the game for a while and don‚Äôt know how shitty RH is. I guess the point really was not that I was going to sell at .01 anyway, but I was ready to market sell them for next to nothing during that huge drop, but this group calmed me the fuck down. I think that is the point of this."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This was tried! He had people working beneath him who were supposed to handle the HF calls. But, maybe unsurprisingly, the HF bigwigs who were stupid and arrogant wouldn't understand what those people were saying, and then if the hedgies made the wrong move (because they didn't even understand the market well enough to USE the information), they'd blame the intel. AND, they were entitled -- so once Ape-mate had people into those customer relationship positions, most of the clients still knew that Ape-mate was the real brains at the operation and, unfailingly, would angrily demand of the assistants, ""Just put Ape-mate on the phone!"" defeating the whole structure that was supposed to shield him from having to do the hand-holding in addition to the data-crunching.

FWIW, his distinct impression was that the vast majority of HF people were the entitled sons of rich people who only had their positions because of connections. They certainly weren't in these positions because they had a good understanding of the market  -- they barely knew what to do even when they were specifically TOLD what to do."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you reply to the wrong thread? Where did I say anything about market orders?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Panicked or not - never ever fucking sell options at market. Always limit orders. I learned it the hard way when selling to close  a 0 DTE call that should have profited by $20k and instead caused me a $20k loss.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm taking predictive analytics in school. I'm really curious about ape-mate's model and if I would understand it with my knowledge. 

There are people in my cohort who used to do investment banking, and take holiday trips to different cities around the world every weekend, but they've never shown up to class or group meetings. Talking to them is like talking to a layman who isn't taking the degree. It's shocking to see that different world, as I'm sitting here in my studio apartment, eating ichiban, but studying my ass off for a better life."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not true. For the exotic animals, old animals or ones that can't reproduce are often singled out as hunting targets and the right to hunt that animal is sold to the highest bidder.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah boomer retards pay hundreds of thousands in donations to just take down one old giraffe.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Hunting and poaching are very different from each-other. Hunting is regulated and supports healthy animal population. Poaching is the most scummiest thing on earth. But I have faith in the apes. We apes together strong.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I can see how as a Mod this would be annoying. You have to watch in order to know if it needs to be taken down. That's a lot of shit to watch
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"To buy the apes? You know not everyone is up to their very last dime in GME stonks, right?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not thaaaaat poor
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Youre annoyed by people giving to endangered animals ? What kinda weirdo are you
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol, urs too tho hahaha"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn't all the people who bid on the auction instead using their money to just donate be better for the animals? Why do they need to kill to give the money to a good cause?

Edit: I am aware I might have come across as accusatory, that's not the intent. I'm legit curious."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,No fair enough. Idk why I assumed most people are all-in
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey idk why i was downvoted hahaha

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you even know what virtue signaling is ? This isnt it. They arent sharing opinions or sentiments, which is what virtue signaling is. Its just a wholesome trend and people really do find a way to get offended by everything and its stupid"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I have every right to find it annoying.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,And I have every right to tell you being annoyed at animal donations is very stupid. And also that you still use virtue signaling very wrong
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Virtue signalling as in hey look at me I'm saving all the animals, here's an annoying video of a gorrilla to go with the million pictures recently posted everywhere.... Since you're so clued up on the semantics here and seem to be quite invested in this, please do tell me what I am missing."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"What youre missing is human decency, thats it thats all. You being offended and annoyed at animal donations (which, wether you like or not, it isnt virtue signaling, check out the definition), is possibly the dumbest reason to be pissed and offended Ive seen on Reddit."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,For me this was from the already realized gains. Better to share some of that now rather than lose all of it in my next FDs.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Cnbc is probably gonna spin it in a negative way somehow.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I was thinking about this earlier today. I feel like WSB mods/admins have been coming down very hard with any post that could signify that we are a collective. You don‚Äôt see many serious post anymore and its like 90% memes. What I was concerned about is that they could somehow use this act of kindness and giving against us by showing the world that we act in unison. Even if it might be a good thing they could easily try to manipulate people into thinking we acted the same way on GME or AMC. Just goes to show how social media and the regular media influence peoples outlooks on a daily basis. Especially without any facts to prove things otherwise.

I would also suggest donating to [Back a Ranger Fund](https://support.worldwildlife.org/site/Donation2?df_id=8120&8120.donation=form1&s_src=AWE1401GD00R), it makes sure the rangers get training and equipment/weapons to protect the animals. 

Rangers are the people who hunt the poachers, they are the heroes that sleep next to the elephants at night and shoot anyone who tries to hurt them. They usually live at the park not seeing their own families for months, poorly funded and they're constantly murdered- six rangers at Virunga Park were killed in January this year already.

[Fallen Rangers Fund](https://virunga.org/support-us/donate/fallen-rangers-fund/) supports the widows and families of rangers who have died protecting endangered animals."

But some dude probably has your money and already bought a yellow jump suit and matching hat.  That photo of Apollo, was taken with a camera pressed up against a rifle scope.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This has nothing to do with WSB or GME. It's a joke trying to play on emotions to get people to sell.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Why you stealing amc and gme hype. Do your own thing.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This person is probably runing a scam like the churches that were claiming you were feeding a kid in Hattie.

Bio:

After witnessing the slaughter of his family this tiny chimpanzee was kept tied up by Chadian rebels at their forest camp near the border of Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon.

When the rebels were flushed out they fled leaving the young chimpanzee behind, luckily he was then rescued by officers of the Ministry of Fauna. Noah arrived at our sanctuary in Mefou forest in January 2018, starving, confused and frightened, jumping at every new sound. He was estimated to be ten months old and weighed just five kilograms. 

He was emaciated and had wounds on his hip joints from being tied up. Initially he appeared to only recognise bread as food but within 48 hours he was eating everything in sight relishing especially oranges, bananas and papaya. He was delighted to discover yoghurt! 

After his traumatic experiences it is no surprise that Noah did show some signs of stress and was ready to bite his caregiver if he was frustrated. 

It did not take long however before he bonded with his caregivers strongly, responding well to gentle grooming and tickling. Once Noah had regained his health and strength it was time to be integrated with the other babies. 

When Noah first met Sandie he was very happy and tried to play however she initially refused but it did not take long for her to become interested and they have been best friends ever since. When first introduced to the boys Lomi√© and Farah, Noah was scared and wanted to stay on his caregivers lap. When the older boys approached, Noah shouted at them, even though they were being calm and wanted to play. Farah and Lomi√© were not put off by Noah‚Äôs display tactics, they watched him for a while and then started running past him pulling his feet, testing his reactions .With interest Noah watched Farah and Lomi√© play and by the end of the day Noah started to tentatively play with the boys, regularly returning back to his caregiver for reassurance. With that promising end to the first day everyone was keen to see how they would all go the next day. 

Everyone was thrilled when the day started with hugs all around between Noah and his new friends. The hugs reassured Noah and with this new confidence he set off exploring with Lomi√©. In no time he was climbing trees with the other baby chimps and playing in the forest. Noah has since been integrated into our PreNursery group where he lives with a small group of young chimps. We expect him to continue to thrive in the sanctuary happily in the company of his own kind."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats!  Looks like Noah is a grower not a show-er?

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,She thickk
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm fairly sure it‚Äôs just a symbolic adoption. They‚Äôll send you pictures and stuff but you‚Äôre basically just donating money to help take care of them.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe this person just likes elephants, and wants to get a thing started, a trend going and inspire other folks to do the same for animals they care about. You'd probably be upvoting if they had posted a huge options loss, but you mock this? Smh."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey don‚Äôt shit on the goodness of humanity

I believe that posts like this help encourage people to do the same kindness, and they help people be positive. I know I sound like a weak ass but hey."

Also realised that people *are* doing something good!  So happy I'm tearing up.  Proud to be part of this group of degenerates.

Don't worry, we'll get back to losing money and drinking urine, but right now let's just embrace the fact that something good is happening in the world."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,this all started with one person donating. they posted it and now everyone is. it can be good sometimes

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean you can look this and any other charity up to see reviews and ratings from thousands of people. I just did and this one seems legit. They've been around since like the 70s and their main thing is elephants.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,If that‚Äôs the case then maybe I‚Äôm wrong on this charity but most of those charities that ask for donations so you can support wild animals are frauds. That‚Äôs why most of them use only pictures of malnutrition animals.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is just f*cking awesome.  This really does exemplify the difference between elitists and regular folk and what they do with surplus cash.   I've been watching you fellas beat the hell out of the hedgefunds and enjoying every second, but this is just like icing on the cake.  Take their money, knock them into the dirt, and use it like this- you fellas are helping restore my faith in humanity.  Keep it going, fellas, keep helping those that are in need and deserve assistance.  I'm a huge fan of big cats, and the Amur Leopard is critically endangered (there's fewer than 100 left in the wild). Throw some love at the big kittehs too!"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"As an amateur economist, its soo interesting for me to watch what is happening here.  Income inequality is obviously (to me) the largest problem in society.  All the nonsense arguments against redistribution of wealth go out the window when I see something like this.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know, rather than doing good for charitable organizations and changing the world for the better, you could be hoarding your piles of cash in a tax sheltered account, thereby assuring your children never have to work or contribute to society and remain out of touch with the plight of the average person on the street."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"All of this because someone said apes together strong at some point, then a bunch of apes kept repeating it and then an autist took it to heart and actually made a donation, snowballing all the apes into repeating it... Because monkey see monkey do.

Thus proving we are all actually just fucking apes.

Apes together strong."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The redistributing of wealth isnt a bad thing by any means.  Just think that most of the people donating arent even at a fraction of wealth.   This coupled with the food pantry donations made possible.  It's almost like theres enough money out there to take care of lots of issues
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This sentiment is what I enjoy most to see. There‚Äôs people here for many reasons. Whether it‚Äôs to make money or ‚Äústick it to the hedgies‚Äù, it doesn‚Äôt matter. What matters is the good that you do with the gains that you make.

Are we going to be like boomers and hoard our wealth infinitely? I don‚Äôt think we should. Save what you need for capital gains tax and spend some money, allow money to be flowed through our economy, it‚Äôs been starving for a long time.

Ultimately it‚Äôs your money, and you can tell me to fuck right off and I‚Äôll be fine with it. However, this is that good shit."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,monke
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What I like about you people compare to wealthy people is you actually use your wealth instead of hoarding it like Smaug. That‚Äôs why I rather trust you guys then some corporate elite.

2021-03-14 09:00:18,wallstreetbets,"SPY $400. Technical analysis for the week ahead for ""beginners"". Not a trading advise.

Following on my comment earlier today, I asked if there was any interest in some bullshit TA for next week since the entire WSB front page is full of legit DD including all kind of mammal pictures. 

I‚Äôm going to keep it as clean and simple as I can using area charts instead of candles. I believe support and resistances are better visible this way. It should help beginners see these levels at first sight. 

**Part I - Bull cases:**

**SPY**

Peaked through resistance and held. Common thought was resistance at 394.xx ATH while I drew my resistance line at 392.50 earlier last week. It held above 392.50 Thursday, resistance became support and whaddaya know a sharp bounce at 392.50 Friday intraday, turning green. Opened a new position on that support confirmation. 3/19 400c. If you're interested in learning charts, I recommend taking an actual look at the chart below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aim6y6vuzwm61.jpg?width=1548&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f63851b772f2bbf8cc7fd3a5cccd38d4d6f9c95f

**Bull Scenario A:**

SPY opens red and tests 392.50-393 Monday again, holds and closes above 396. If this plays out, we‚Äôre likely see the 400 breach Tuesday intraday. I won‚Äôt be spooked by the Monday dip. Might actually add. 

**Bull Scenario B:**

No repetitive back test. Face ripping rally above 400. 

Who would think folks will get their stimmy this weekend and the forbidden digital asset will trade above $60K? Honestly guys, this was kinda obvious. Not saying retail is single-handedly causing this. In my opinion, institutions anticipating this move is behind the $60K breach. I bet if we look at today‚Äôs buying blocks next week, we will see double digit unit purchases dominating fraction buys. This will be the confirmation of institution involvement, bringing retail inside.

Anyway,

$60K+, VIX potential $20 break down, QQQ short term bottom(?) and current market momentum pointing SPY 400 Monday. Many more detailed indicators (Bullish MACD cross overs, call/put ratios, percentage of tickers above 200 moving average inside SPY etc.) supporting this but explaining them without a video is not practical. 

Continuing on scenario B...Test 402 Monday intraday, rejection, test 404 (actual resistance) Tuesday and a sharp rejection. This is where I‚Äôm hoping to exit my 400c position and go short term üåàüêª. Monday closing above 400 (or not) will be the deciding factor. 

**VIX**

Fellas this part is important. Spend some time on the chart below. VIX is very close to the infamous $20 support. Last time that support was tested, bears raped EVERYONE. They took no prisoners. I‚Äôd like to point out that last time it was under 20 was **more than a year ago.** Rules apply. VIX goes up, stocks goes down and vice versa. AKA fear indicator. If VIX goes below 20, which is a big event, **Bull Scenario B** will apply 100%.

https://preview.redd.it/e7kms0qy2xm61.jpg?width=1550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=743d02ae122887214dbfcf976d2ffbb2a7f4aa0b

**QQQ**

I think we‚Äôve all learned the last 3 weeks that portfolio diversification is a real thing üôÉ 

While QQQ is still sitting at a bear territory, it showed signs of a likely short term bottom. Mighty 323 resistance (double top) and 311 is the VERY important support. I believe it‚Äôs going to follow the rest of the crowd, breaking key resistances at 318 and 323. I will be on the look out for 318+ Monday premarket for confirmation. If so, above **Bull Scenario A or B** likely apply, thus giving bears little to no early hope.

**TSLA**

While 700 resistance is obvious, i believe 720 is much more important. 

In above Bull Scenario A, TSLA tests 688 support, bounces and close above 705. Tuesday tests 720 for real for real and hard rejection.

In above Bull Scenario B, pre-market 700+ straight up, taking advantage of pre-market low volume (I believe it did this at 800 as well) and blasts through 720. This level is where I‚Äôm hoping to exit my 3/19 700 calls.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP - thanks for the read.  Next week will be very interesting.  We have some big catalysts coming up.   

\- Fed Meeting

\- TNX 10 year is still very volatile. 

We know J Pow is happy to let rates go to a healthy 2%.  I don't see an operation twist to control rates happening unless:

1.  we start to see wild sharp increases in rates. J Pow has already said the 10 year zooming to 1.6% ""caught his eye"" 
2. Right know big banks are allowed to buy treasuries and not count against their liquidity ratio - at least until March 31.  I see J Pow extending.   If not, mayhem will ensue as banks dump T Bills to meet liquidity targets set by the fed.

Did anyone notice on Friday that the market didn't really care that rates zoomed from 1.5 to 1.6 (1 year high) out of nowhere?  I seems the market is getting used to a certain rates range.  If it zooms to 1.7+ in a short period of time, sheet will hit the fan."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for clarifying!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Did anyone notice on Friday that the market didn't really care that rates zoomed from 1.5 to

I‚Äôve got an explanation for that !

I‚Äôve been reading up on short term second derivative flow vs macro economic flow and how to tell when it is important 

The first thing you need to do is set up a bollinger band with a 20 day simple moving average and +/- 1 standard deviation channel. Movement in the 1 as channel is expected and noice. Breaking and closing above or below the 1sd is not noise and indicative of further movement in that direction 

If you look back to the weakness a few weeks ago you‚Äôll notice we sold past but never closed below the 1sd channel. Technically you need 2 days closing below in order to confirm trend

So, there are 2 second order derivatives that are very important: vanna and charm. These provide support in what is know as a ‚Äúbullish window‚Äù which exists every month before monthly
VIX expired AND ALSO before monthly OPEX

After those 2 expirations, vanna and charm have minimal effect on the market and a bearish window appears. Macro events heavily influence market movement during this window 

That said, this week is fed week. The market ignored the rise last week because:

1) vanna / charm are working overtime 

2) who knows what the fed will say/do and HOPIUM is kinda huge right now

The biggest tell next week is the following 

1) monthly vix expires 3/17, the day of FOMC

2) if we can not breach new ATHs AND CLOSE THERE by 3/17, look out below 

3) if we DO breach ATH and close at the highs by 3/17, the bearish window will be very short lived and that gives us the pass to 4200-4300 range

So, sit back and enjoy! It‚Äôs going to be a wild ride"

I have spent the last two years deciding who will live and who will die. It shows. I am so lean you can count my ribs. My hair is falling out in patches, leaving skin that looks like cured leather. Some of my people call me martyr. Most call me traitor.

It had begun when I befriended one of the lords. At the time we were both outcasts, lost and trying to survive in the jungle. When I met the young noble, a child really, he was nearly starved. He had been exiled from the kingdom and forced to find his own way. But I taught the child to find food and shelter. I taught him to live with his past and the obvious guilt he carried around. And over time we became great friends.

This might seem perfectly natural: two lost ones meeting and mutual survival growing into mutual friendship. It was not. The lords have always preyed upon my kind. They relied upon us to feed their kingdom. They hunted us for sport. My kind are beneath the lords, not worthy even of being seen.

But this lordling turned out to be something more. He was a king. One day a lady from his kingdom came to him and bid him to return with her. He did, bringing me back with him. And when the king regained his throne he said to me: ‚ÄúI cannot stop the killing and abuse of your kind, but I will spare you personal losses. So name for me those we would spare and it will be done.‚Äù

And since that day I have kept a list. A list of those who might be spared. I named those whom I grew close to, and those who led our kind. But I couldn‚Äôt list everyone. 

And so the burden grew heavier. More and more people blamed me for the deaths among us. I became a pariah. Fewer and fewer of my people would have anything to do with me. More and more called for me to be given to the lords as a stinking traitor. As a murderer. All I wanted was to save a few.

One of these few was a woman I loved. I don‚Äôt know what she felt for me. We argued often about my role, and about the decisions I had made. And she refused to be on the list. This strength of spirit drew me to her even more than her beauty. We kept this up for many months, often arguing but also growing closer. And I caved to her desire to keep her off the list, hoping that my obvious proximity and fondness of her would be protection enough.

Then one day two young lords came up to me smiling. ‚ÄúWe bring good news. That sow who has been giving you so much trouble is dead. We killed her.‚Äù They seemed so proud of their deed. Seeing the beginnings of my despair the other lord said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. It was quick. We didn‚Äôt play with her, just ripped her throat out.‚Äù

I shouted. Screamed. The lords look at each other, confused. Then they shrugged and wandered back the way they had come. I continued to scream until I ran out of breath. I could have saved her. I could have put her on the list even if it meant she wouldn‚Äôt talk to me. My desire killed her. I collapsed onto the ground and sobbed. Sorry for her. Sorry for myself. Sorry for all of my kind.

After a while I staggered to my feet and started walking toward that distant jungle. I sang to myself quietly. ‚ÄúHakuna Matata! What a wonderful phrase.‚Äù"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Gorgeous
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What a wonderful phrase.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,WSB should have a ticker showing how much has been donated to good causes to show the world that smaller investors are better than the hedgies.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Quit spending money on stuff that could be better used to buy more GME.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This post is a distraction from ape donations. similar to how SLV was a distraction from GME. Don‚Äôt let them fool you and keep donating to apes
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This has nothing to do with WSB or GME. It's a joke trying to play on emotions to get people to sell.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I think this is bullshit. 

There is no point in adopting him. 
He won't sing for you nor help you if you need to challenge your evil relatives. 


I bet he won't even tell you which insects are best to eat, so good luck wasting your money."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Just a distraction by hedgies to get us to turn stock in.  Idiots
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This seems photoshopped.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I know this is cool and all but shouldn‚Äôt we be buying more GME and not adopt a bunch of mascots?

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you donate, yes or no?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I think this signs you up for a duck.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It pays for their care and food ‚ò∫Ô∏è
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I imagine adopting it pays for food/vet care/protection? and you get pics of updates and stuff.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol, the money doesn't literally take care of that 1 animal they show you, that's just symbolic to make you feel better, the money goes towards running the organization in general. Taking care of wild animals in the middle of nowhere doesn't bring in any revenue aside from some grants I'm guessing, so it's rough for them without donations."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea all these animals get personal bodyguards. We gotta slow down with these adoptions because the the forest is now 80% bodyguard and 20% other animals. 

Every animal has like 4 bodyguards now (except the ugly ones because they don't get adopted :( ), and the gorillas have already killed like 6. 

It's getting kind of messy because the bodyguards are stopping the lions from eating the smaller animals, so now the bodyguards have formed factions and are fighting a civil war.

All in all it's a very eventful time in Rwanda, normally known for it's relaxed atmosphere and many bbq's."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I actually would. I love all children equally. All children have potential we would never know, because of lack of access to education or living in places like war-torn Syria, or civil unrest in Myanmar, where an innocent girl was recently killed. We have to ask ourselves, it wasn't Einstein who created the GPS, but he laid the foundation for future generations to create such technology by access to studying theories such as space-time dilation. It wasn't his grandchildren nor his family members, but children who were aspired by scientific knowledge. That potentiality exists in every child. The manifestation of that potentiality is obviously not afforded the same learning and healthy environment for every child on this delicate ecosystem we call, Earth.

I've been designing a science oriented human fund platform for a while now, but I haven't exposed it to only a few of my college friends, because I'm afraid there are agendas that would abuse such a system. 

I'm actually thinking of uploading all of my design data on cloud and  asking r/WSB if people on here would be willing to fund the development of the platform, after they see it themselves, seeing how everyday Joes like me, are willing to give simply for empathy. It's going to be completely open source with 100% transparency. The idea is that people get to see such ideas as, ""trickle-down"" actually functioning as intended by design, instead of being manipulated by agendas such as the Republican Party in the US."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh shit. It took me way too long to process that you picked a hedgehog because of the ‚Äúhedges‚Äù. I just thought Gabe Plotkin just straight up looks like a hedgehog.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP, I feel ya. I've lost just as much in such a way, several times. The reality is that there are many ways to ""lose"" in trading, and very few ways to truly win. 

For example, it can feel like a loss when you missed out on the bottom, sold too early, averaged up and then it tanked, day-trading/paper-hands for a loss, paper-hands for a profit (like this one, but can you really call 5x paper-hands?), and finally actually buying high and selling low for losses of variable sizes. And the single way everyone wants to aim for to win is by buying the bottom and selling the top. 

Best lessons I learned was to split up buys and sells, take profits on way up. And if you are comfortable with that, learn some TA, do DD, and put it all together. Thanks for the post, and God-speed!"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not American so I don't get stimulus checks, I'm in an asian country. The school fees were first paid for by my dad, because he would rather lend me the money first than let the banks eat up more money thanks to interest. But I would like to pay him back as soon as possible, even if there's no interest.

And yeah, the value of GME is so unpredictable that I want to take more profits when I can. I mean I definitely hope that it will go up to the thousands for all of us on WSB, but I'm honestly afraid that more bullshit like the Robinhood trade stops will happen that stops the price from going higher than a certain level."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Americans don't just get a stimulus check, there's been a lot of talk about loan forgiveness.

Where I live about 10 years ago a lot of people who didn't need it took out student loans, and then bought apartments, because the interest was way lower than the regular real estate loan.

Sometimes if your interest is low enough or non existant it's actually cheaper to not pay it back if you have a good investment opportunity. What's IBM dividend, like 5%?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a good point, but the interest is about 4-5% here: https://www.moneysmart.sg/education-loan

But yeah, thanks to my dad, there's no interest :D Honestly I'm quite thankful that he paid the school fees first. He also knows about me buying GME, and advised me to sell some of it when it's higher, just in case anything happens"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Technically, you could use the dividend to pay the interest, and still profit from stock price growth. But it's kinda cutting it close according to out-my-butt math."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, we would rather not pay the bank the interest if we can afford it first. But I see your point about investing being a good choice to cover for loans with smaller interest"
2021-03-14 07:56:36,wallstreetbets,"How many funds account for the bulk of the short sellers? We like to talk about HFs like they‚Äôre monoliths (note to apes: picture a giant, shiny, angular dildo), but obviously there are lots of players working lots of angles in the GME saga. 

My assumption is that retail investors aren‚Äôt doing a lot of short selling; the hedge funds and investment banks are, and they have untold billions in their fuckery budgets. We have more individual investors, they have more dollars. 

But while I have a rough mental estimate of the size of the WSB crowd, I have no sense of the number of institutional players. Recognizing that they‚Äôre all encrusted to their come-encrusted titties, how many firms do you think are pursuing a strategy of heavily shorting GME? 

Are we up against ten firms? 100? 1000?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"My assumption is that about one dozen firms, whose worth may be around 200B combined, still pursue mid-term short positions in GME and AMC.  There may be another dozen HF who take short-term short positions when they think it will dip on the day or week.  Most ‚Äúretirement‚Äù institutions (such as vanguard) are reticent to risk their name on short positions which could easily crash their profits when the market appreciates."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,We aren't against anyone lmao. Really not understanding this sudden short-seller hate. One of the top posts in this sub is literally a YOLO about shorting the Argentinian economy.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hedge funds are more careful now since Melvin got burned losing billions. I don‚Äôt think they want go ‚Äòlong‚Äô on their shorts as much as before, but would rather day trade them like we saw last week. It is also an optimal strategy against any bubble and it goes like this:

1.	Identify an overvalued stock (i.e. a bubble). 
2.	buy a lot of puts at different strike prices below the current price
3.	heavily short sell the stock
4.	wait for the negative gamma squeeze to help push price down and make shares available to buy at a low price point
5.	close the shorts
6.	profit!"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"No ape left behind. 

This is us putting our money where our mouths are. I remember many of us back around January talked about how we would do good with the money the Hedgies were using to game the system and fuck over the common ape. We talked about being nice to our mothers, paying medical bills and alike. This becoming a trend is us fulfilling that promise. 

Apes strong together."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,$77k raised in one day... the potential of this sub is unbelievable.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Better keep them donations coming so they can make room for us when we retire

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait so adopting an ape doesn't mean we get to bring him home.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Wonder if Chewy.com will start carrying monkey products.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,So alot of yall are new... yes i only joined in January.  But we talked alot about buying GameStop stuff and donating it to children's hospitals.  There was alot of that happening.  Donating wherever and whatever should be the way.  This is the way
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Vlad, Ken and Gabe should match these donations."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Much respect to you guys for taking the gains and helping save Wildlife.  If only the other members of Wallstreet acted in such a affirming manner.  Go wallstreetbets!!!!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Which one is the official twitter?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"While they are paying Bots with their money, we pay and save apes!"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jesus, who the f keeps cutting onions around here!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Media outlets need to pick up this positive story and put it on every site or paper available. Not enough positive news in the news these days. Well doneüëçüíéüôå
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I still think being apes is stupid. I still think of everyone here as fellow functioning retards. That said, I think the adoptions are really awesome and funny as $hit! I wonder if I can adopt some guerrillas!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats Ape Nation! Already making a difference. Much love to all and lets keep doing good things. Now go eat a green crayon. üêµ üí™
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Stealing from the rich to give to the poor. Are y‚Äôall sure you ain‚Äôt undercover Robinhood?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate your charitable efforts. Those are always a positive to the world.
I, however, only have money for GME until MOASS occurs. I personally want to keep bolstering my position to get myself the best chance possible against the shorts.
Once the MOASS has occured & I've received my tendies, then I plan on making charitable contributions.
Until then BUY & HODL GME is all I know üíéüôåüöÄ"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know some of you are thinking ""wow, that 77k could have go into GME"". Yeah but look at these beautiful fuckin apes!! I can only imagine how many animals and children will receive donations after we receive our tendies."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,My wife wanted to know why there was an orangutan joining us for breakfast.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Could someone explain why everyone began adopting animals? I‚Äôm so confused
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm not an emotional type but I needed this after frying myself watching the GME ticker last week.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly this is unbelievable. Yes apes are cool and I‚Äôm glad that we are saving them... but the support going to the women in Rwanda üá∑üáº is unbelievable. Probably directly saved the lives of at least 4 people with this $75k by making safe jobs available.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Slowly this is turning into a worldwide event not just to wreck those hedgies into the ground but to rebuild what those fucked up billionares and other filthy rich bastards have destroyed to make all those tendies. 


Walsstreetbets and gme are the true robin hoods of this world at the moment. We take back what they have stolen! And we give it to those who need it. 

True meaning of the gme stampede.

Can't stop us now! The fire will grow bigger and bigger and will become an unstoppable force."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stop posting charity, buy more GME and save more animals after."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't trust any charities... most of the raised money go to somebody's pocket instead of the cause they advertising..
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It's the circle of life
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Ouch. This hurts.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,He could have saved all the apes instead lol
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,We mustn‚Äôt speak of him

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Personal attack. Against most of us.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe they go all in into GME with 77k bucks? 

This is the way"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,That's not the correct (WSBMod) account though...
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Someone would have to truly be smooth brained to believe that there is any coordination here. ""smooth brain, autist, retard apes"" thatsthejoke.jpg. It's clearly just a bunch of people that like the stock, and memes, and loss porn.

It's not like reddit is using supercomputers operating at the microsecond level to run algorithms that can make millions of trades before any of us can blink. It's not like reddit has the ability to coordinate naked short attacks to the tune of -50% in seven minutes. Redditors couldn't strangle companies into bankruptcy for tax free profit. Trending on twitter over altruism, sure, but don't think we could we could steer the MSM towards, or away, from a stock. And we certainly couldn't infiltrate institutional communities posing as legitimate while sowing fear, doubt, and uncertainty.

So as long as it's just a bunch of apes that like the stock that's just individual retail investors posting memes and discussing DD/TA. If we did any of that other stuff, *that* would be market manipulation."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Tag enough media in the post.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,$62.50 for one or $125 for a parent/child pair. But they give you a field to donate whatever you feel like. This is the most wholesome and worthwhile shit I‚Äôve seen on this sub in a long time.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably donated to the Melvin capital memorial fund
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,wife's boyfriend fund
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, usually they simply ask you if you'd like to cover the transaction (?) fee, that otherwise would be charged to the charity, if you want to"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The fee is the cost that intermediate institutions charge such as credit card processors. By separating out the fees you can see exactly where your money is going--this is good.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you can also screenshot it after you black it out, then submit the screenshot. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep payment processing fees
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,3% is what the credit card companies usually charge. They are giving you the option to help cover that expense.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,CC processing fees. OP was kind enough to cover them their self instead of having them deducted from the amount donated on the backend.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know right, maybe they don‚Äôt want that many donors"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I've noticed this happening a lot recently
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This looks like spam. The mods have been notified.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree. Going to jump on the wagon as soon as I get my apes in a line
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,We should erect a giant phallus in their memory
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Take the fee out of the donation for a deduction
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never use the highlighter, it‚Äôs that simple.

If the pixels aren‚Äôt a solid color theres data on the screen. A screenshot helps, but only because it lowers the resolution. It doesn‚Äôt fix the bad redaction.

Recovery difficulty:
Hard (small image screenshot) vs. Impossible (solid black box)

If you had $250,000 pictured would you want it to be hard or impossible to steal your identity? Just take the extra fucking two seconds."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I‚Äôve been paranoid about it for like the last year+ since I saw a post of someone using the iOS contrast setting to invert colors and get someone‚Äôs CC info. My advice is generally crop out what you want removed or just don‚Äôt risk it unless necessary
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,So have I! Lots of unprotected banana lockers.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotta pass over with the market at least 3 times

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You guys know this is serious stuff, and that these guys need help forever, right? Don't bail on them, they'll still be here years from now. Not to Sally Struthers too much, but I hope a good number of us will commit to long-term assistance. It's cheap compared to the out-of-wedlock kid your wife's boyfriend had with that teen girl you tricked into coming over, and devoid all the disgust your parents and coworkers have. Plus it's cheap if a decent volume of us take part. For Christ's sake can you maybe do one single thing your mother doesn't need to weep over? Each and every one of these ape-friends understands the desire for profit and the joy one experiences from it, same as you, grudgingly appreciates the lessons of loss, same as you, and deserves to not be forgotten, same as you. 

Also good to keep in mind that as society slowly disintegrates it will be in our collective interest to have a large group of willing individuals willing to stick up for us. I'm not saying faces, hands, and genitals flung all over is what will be required but it's good to know the potential is there."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It never fails to amaze me how human like apes are.  It feels so weird seeing an animal do things humans can do and fully understand what they are doing.  Apes are one of the most fascinating creatures on this planet.

I mean, look at what we have done with this subreddit."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Which ape of those 2 are we?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,this is the way
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,When I first saw this some chimp expert said that there was a behavioral significance to the way the chimp reached under his hands to take it palm up. Something along the lines of offering a hand palm up being a sign of peace and palm down being a sign of dominance.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Best video.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,He didn‚Äôt even try.  Chimp took him with all that love as it was nothing.  And then gave an fist bump that could have been ignored but wasn‚Äôt.   I wish I had wife‚Äôs boyfriends like this.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,And rip his face off.  Chimps are dangerous animals.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,More like: Humans are weak ass pussies. Like seriously. We opted for stamina instead of strength.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look at chimps without hair, they are ripped as hell"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a young ape too. The full grown ones are fucking huge. Much bigger than you would normally expect from movies.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but they're not ""10 times stronger than humans"" as people so often love to repeat."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you Joe Rogan?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Chimps arent any stronger than the average person. But due to them being half the size of a normal person their strength is still very impressive
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,They're all muscle and can tear you in half. Or YOLO on some stocks. Truly scary.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Search up a shaved chimp. Their Triceps literally have triceps
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I really want to hang out with a peaceful jacked chimp.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Who needs to swim when you have built-in üíéüôå
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the primary tradeoff is brain size. Iirc humans and chimps use the same amount of energy per unit of body mass, but in humans 20% of that goes to the brain whereas chimps have more energy dedicated to fast twitch muscle fibers.

But it's not necessarily a clear cut brain vs brawn dichotomy. Humans benefit from better endurance and fine-grained muscle manipulation in the hands/arms, while chimps have demonstrated better short term memory than the average human when it comes to memorizing a series of numbers."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Orangutans are known to try and save humans that are swimming. They have the same problem as chimps as they cannot swim. They identify humans as apes also and apply their own understanding of themselves onto humans and panic thinking a human will drown in water.

Another thing humans have that other apes don't, is their dexterity. Humans are weak in muscle strength, but are built for endurance and delicate manipulation of objects. Things like putting keys in pad locks and basket weaving are easy for a human, but other great apes will struggle and/or not be able to do. Humans can also out walk any animal to the point of death, as they are adapted to sweat instead of pant to release heat build up."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I suggest relentless posting on social media year after year about the plight of great apes and a list of companies to boycott. Their wallets and public image are their Achilles heel. This is something that needs to be ruthlessly pursued indefinitely until something is done and is a good cause to dedicate part of your year to. I would like to find a good charity to donate to / or eventually work with in my spare time to pursue great ape conservation.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"We can make a separate post organizing the formation of a tax deductible charity that hires security to patrol the Gorilla, Chimpanzee, Gibbon, and Orangutan sanctuaries. The guards I'm sure would be glad to work for like $1 a day (Of course we would pay more, just to make them see the parks as worthy of protecting). This would be a fun venture and would give some of us the adventure aspect of our lives that we've been missing out on (if we visit these areas to see how things are running). I would have to look into if any similar and functional charities like this exist first though. We can nominate DeepFuckingValue to organize this lol I'm sure he'd be happy to do it and we would pay less in taxes if we have a bunch of us on board working with the charity.

For fucks sake, I'm sure we could do a better job at conservation than any of these cuck boomers. Pay a bunch of people to patrol the parks and get the message out to the poachers that they're dead if they harm any of the animals in the parks, and let them know they'd make more money as guards than as being poachers."

She would tell stories of how he would cry at the thought of her leaving him, which she declared was going to happen at a set date at the beginning of their beta cuck relationship.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,There is *a* clip by David Attenborape of people doing it. It has been sensationalised by reddit. Exhaustion hunting is not a common form of hunting by humans.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This actually takes pretty high-skill tracking techniques to pull off, so seems unlikely to have been a fundamental part of our evolution. An alternative theory that I prefer is that humans evolved to be bipedal long-distance walkers because we were scavengers, rather than hunters - we ranged long distances basically searching for leftovers from the ‚Äúreal‚Äù predators.

Edit: the Radiolab episode Man Against Horse covers this topic if anyone‚Äôs interested."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it has something to do with the unique way they handle food, they can burn fat directly"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really. It all depends on the environment. If it's an environment where sweating is not necessary or a bad thing then of course the sled dog will win because our main advantage over other animals is neglected. If the human is in an environment where they're sweating buckets, I doubt a sled dog can handle it.

A polar bear can certainly out distance a human in the artic after all."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see this claim a lot but no way. Wolves, horses, antelope, even bears are reported as traveling over 100 miles in a day.  Your example might work during extremely hot days or under specific conditions but I've driven parallel to a herd of antelope going 45 mph+ for a good 15 minutes and nobody would be able to keep up with those fuckers."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably. Bonobos are the only other ape that casually has sex without the goal of reproduction.

2021-03-14 07:05:39,wallstreetbets,"Potential (inevitable?) $MVIS buyout **Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Do your own research before making any investment. I am biased due to holding MVIS shares.**

MVIS had an earnings call on Thursday during which the CEO Sumit Sharma was noticeably excited and mentioned that the company was for sale several times, including direct quote ‚ÄúIn conclusion, we remain committed to exploring synergic alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company, in part or whole, to maximize value for our shareholders.‚Äù

Here is a transcript of the call: [https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/34950d17-39cc-4cdc-87c6-b6714a06b89a](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/34950d17-39cc-4cdc-87c6-b6714a06b89a)

And here is the audio from the call: [https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/48120c74-0702-4285-bfd9-e8334da64933](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/48120c74-0702-4285-bfd9-e8334da64933)

I‚Äôm not going to post any DD because there‚Äôs already a bunch of amazing DD over at r/MVIS. I suggest you check it out.

There‚Äôs been speculation by longtime MVIS holders of a buyout for quite some time now due to their LiDAR (their product) being used in Microsoft‚Äôs HoloLens, but since LiDAR is also getting hyped as the technology that will make self-driving cars possible, some other players have emerged as potential partners / buyers. Again, check out all the DD on r/MVIS.

I‚Äôm posting this because WSB has changed my life. The only reason I have any money to invest is because of ideas from this subreddit and I want to pay it forward by contributing to the knowledge base. For anyone trying to find solid DD, sifting through all the posts, maybe not being able to afford something as expensive as GME - this is for you. I strongly believe in MVIS and think a buyout resulting in a huge jump in share price is coming. Good luck to all!

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought them at $5
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"In for 100 measly shares at 13 bucks and have no real idea what these guys are doing but mvis seems to have a cult following so I'm very optimistic!

Weird thing about earnings other day was they made nothing but the shares rocketed after hours. Im guessing people were just happy about the tone of the call and they are releasing something in April?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,15000 shares and 50 $2.5 call options for 5/21/2021 LFG
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What could be the price of stock once it‚Äôs bought out?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I owned MVIS 15 years ago. Every call i heard, and every news story i read made me think it was on the brink of a breakout. I finally sold it and moved on. Cool tech, but never any traction. Just more share issuance and dilution. Was like owning a biotech."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll check it out on Monday. I've only got a spare $170 til I pull out of a certain stock and not really interested in picking up just 10 stocks.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mvis ran from 30cents to 1.5 in April on buyout rumors.

This stock has 100x on buyout rumors. 
Ask yourself if it wasn‚Äôt bought out at 1$ why would it be bought out now.

I have a short and will close it on Monday. Too many people are bullish and will probably go higher short term with all the call options being bought.

400k revenue 2.5billion market cap. Just make sure to get off the ride before the crash. I‚Äôll be watching from the sideline."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hidenburg research posted that MVIS was almost a fraud. 

You know they posted revenue this year, when the last two years they had 0 revenue and have gone through the roof since then despite having no profit.

Almost like they are a zombie company. 

I hope I'm wrong but might be better off selling the rumor. Dont want to be like cciv bagholders thinking they were in for a payday until the deal was announced and they sharply tanked overnight."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it's so nice to have found something that we can be this confident in. There's really no worry in my mind at all
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Amazing!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the soon to be millionaire club!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,you sold 75 contracts? 7500 shares? thats bullish asf.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hear you. Many dips could have been purchased last week, but hindsight is 20/20. A buyout would moon this baby, so I still think it's on clearance. Plus their latest LiDAR model comes out in April. That should help the price even with no buyout news."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats on your future tendies!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"We've all been there! Don't worry, 1K shares is a damn nice position!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Sameee. But I covered it in time for a loss. Didn't wanna lose them.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the heads up
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I would head to r/MVIS for any kind of technical analysis of potential prices. Some posts there have speculated it could easily be 5x current price
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's really interesting. I'd possibly be jaded if I was in your position. I'm new to the stock so I haven't experienced any disappointments with it. I wonder what you'd think of this recent call if you listen to it. Some longer holders in r/MVIS said it was the best call they'd ever heard, but of course I can't confirm that myself because I haven't been around. I was really encouraged that they basically led the call by saying they're going to be bought out."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You might want to do just a bit of DD on who has joined the MVIS board recently

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,i might roll it out. we‚Äôll see how next week goes!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Speculation is it will 2x by mid April but the sky is the limit of you‚Äôre willing to hold. A Buy Out should bring from $90-$150 per share and could go up to from there if the April demo go wells for some of the big players showing up. Rumors already spreading that Elon will be at the Demo.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"At 2 a share your risk is different then somebody buying in a 10x that.

I assume your talking about Seval Oz? I'll do some more research into it but I'm wondering what the implications of the fact that she was involved with waymo have to do with the valuation potential of mvis.

My memory might be off, I looked at their 10k approx 2 or 3 weeks ago but if I remember correctly they only had 3 clients last year a loss of a few million a going concern opinion and significant debt on the balance sheet.

There's around 100 LIDAR companies on the market and the majority with demonstrable products with revenue streams. 

A buyer comes along for MVIS with a cash offer those debts will be paid first before the shareholders. Your talking about an astronomical valuation for it to be above the current share price.

With three ATM's the only thing keeping mvis going is the high share price. 

I'm just saying somebody getting in now at this price could lose out big time if the sale isn't for what the companies trading at.

I'll do more research but I think when the ""strategic alternative"" is found might not be what people buying in are hoping for."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow! That goes to show that nothing is ever 100% certain! I do trust the current research and $18 is a nicer entry than $500 lol
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do some DD 

There could be 1000 Lidar companies...none of them can touch or specs nor add a camera in the same sensor. We are already years ahead and far superior

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"What's the point of getting Internet clout on a freaking anonymous reddit account

And the money is for a good cause too

Plus it's because of all these posts that I'm making a donation too, otherwise I wouldn't even have heard of these organisations"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Get out of here.  We were having a fucking moment.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"how about instead of spreading this negativity, you adopt a gorilla or elephant too? what a salty degenerate fuck"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone should be shorting apes.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought the ape adoptions were kind but the elephants for some reason hit me on a really emotional level so fuck you for all these feels I'm experiencing. I apparently really resonate with elephants and I didn't know this until now for some reason. Also I've been drinking but regardless.

As thanks I'll give you 1 IOU to create content for one of the following:

\- DD on a stock ( Check my posts I do my fucking homework I'm not some lazy shit head. I have two business degrees I'm not retarded I will actually do work.)

\- Explanation of one option Greek (check my posts, esp my recent on theta)

\- Explanation of one option trading strategy

\- One market hedging strategy.

I'll call you out as the sponsor for the post.

Message me with ""IOU"" and your choice and I will post within 1 week."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,OP requested Bark. I am currently doing research and the write up. The DD cannot be on this sub it is a private company involved with a spac and therefore would be against the rules. I will post on a different sub where spacs aren't banned.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You do realize there needs to be an exit strategy, right? Like we need to decide when the squeeze is squoze. Once the hedgies cover it will just be apes holding the bags

The ideal scenario is it gets to $X and hedgies have to cover and we give them the shares. That way retail walks away with a huge profit, and only greedy idiots try to wait for $500,000 like one poster here

If people start believing 5K is not a meme, after the squeeze is done they will be left holding the bag. Sure, the company might be worth $200 by its own merits, but not $5000

There has to be a point at which we need to agree we won"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Worked as an underwriter for many years and in my experience  rebounding from this is very easy.

Just don't let account go 30+ as that will royally fuck you.  Most places are fine with a chapter 7, you now have more money to pay them.  What scares them off is a missed payment after the chapter 7, makes you toxic af.

Also watch the inquiries, if you rack them up after discharge also makes you toxic af.  takes 1 month or so for new accounts to show up on the report so if you have 20 inquiries we usually assume you opened 20 accounts if it's been less than 2 months since the inquiry and it doesn't show on the report yet

For the company I worked for, we didn't give a shit about chapter 7's as long as it was discharged more than a few months prior to applying."

It sounds a lot like the stuff coming out of the 90's. You should find a female vocalist that is cute with a nice voice you can team up with and start posting new content. Maybe stream on twitch or something as well. It's great to have a hobby that you are good at that produces art with real tangible value it would be a shame to just drop it completely and move on.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Donald Trump would be proud
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"That would be hilarious. My attorney and I will present proof of my portfolio was below the wildcard limit at filing, the banks can't touch my new tendies."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"holy fuck bro, been a while since ive seen you."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely, then I'll buy the dip again."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Include the  saving apes in Africa part and I will buy the book and movie rights if we can get Cramer on board.The contract is in the mail as we speak....
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is a gain! Filing last week saved me 10k of gains this week, including the $1800 cost of filing."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Seriously. That doesn‚Äôt make you ‚Äú#winning‚Äù that just shows you‚Äôre an impulsive child with no financial sense. OP is the reason credit card rates are so high.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao, ikr. My attorney and I were frantically getting it filed last week, terrified with how volatile my portfolio has been on this rocketship to make sure I could protect as much as I could."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"i would upvote, but you got the sex number and i want to keep it that way"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"His wife's boyfriend already left her, because she couldn't get to the tendies he is making"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely, it's been a blessing I was able to file last week."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,A LOLOW
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought I was at Wendy's getting more tendies
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"So far so great! I worked with a bankruptcy attorney. Assets gained above the 14k wildcard limit for chapter 7 are legally untouchable after filing, as they take a snapshot in time of your accounts when you file. I provided all proof of balances last week. That's why I was rushing to file last week."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the tips! I'll definitely be a better behaved ape if I ever touch credit again, which I'm avoiding like the plague."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,That was last week. I've been moving to Fidelity. I'm retarded but I can still read stuff on the internet lol.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow is what I said too. Fuck
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Not according to my attorney. Bankruptcy saved my ass.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I filed a 7, got discharged and had credit offers in my mail box within a week; a banker once told me they‚Äôd love to give you a cc after bk, cuz that means you can‚Äôt file again for 7 years..."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,My attorney said I can rebuild it to 700 in 18-24 months. My credit score was already 500 with 40k in credit card debt. Filing last was the best case scenario.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Who the fuck cares about credit when you got a boat load of cash?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish! It only canceled out my negative balances lol
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ikr, my favorite part was that I was using Robinhood back then. I've been switching to Fidelity."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,10k so far*
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll come back to music once I buy a new house or van and aren't financially stressed as much about finding a new place to live within the next few months. Thanks for your support and encouragement!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It won't take that long, since he can't refile again for several years he will have people offering him credit in 12 to 18 months or better."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"My credit score was already 500 with 40k in credit card debt. Yes it's true I can't finance a mortgage for 2 years because of the bankruptcy, but my credit score will be back to 700 in 18-24 months according to my attorney. My plan is to buy a house in cash or live in a van down by the river. This was my plan I decided 3 years ago, everything is working out better than my expectations."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I declared bankruptcy to protect my future gme gains from my credit card debt creditors that were starting to sue me.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,My wife's boyfriend told me it's dangerous to post personal information on online forums.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Not buying more gme last month was much more retarded
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks but I've been here since mid January and still retarded lol
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I am the danger! (To my financial health)
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I borrowed money to help pay to renovate my parents house that was going to get condemned if I didn't help save them. I bought all these toys I sold in cash years ago.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I've had an attorney throughout the entire process. Filing at that specific time and with my credit goals in mind was the best case scenario.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bankruptcy is complicated and many people try to over simplify it to make themselves feel better about the situation. If you paid off your debt, and you‚Äôre free and clear without bankruptcy, your temporary sacrifice was worth it."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,That plan works well too if you're able to keep a job.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Check with a bankruptcy attorney in your state on what you can buy that's exempt in order to get below your wildcard limit. In my case I could buy a mattress as exempt property if I was over my wildcard too much. That was my exact issue too last month.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"My credit score was already 500 with 40k in credit card debt. Yes it's true I can't finance a mortgage for 2 years because of the bankruptcy, but my credit score will be back to 700 in 18-24 months. My plan is to buy a house in cash or live in a van down by the river. This was my plan I decided 3 years ago, everything is working out better than my expectations."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I was referencing Charlie Sheen.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Untill the judge sees your Reddit posts
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems like you have some experience in this.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You have big brass balls !!!!!  I‚Äôll give you that !!!!     Just put it all on red 19 at roulette
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey man I‚Äôm not knocking you, you do you! In 100 years none of it will matter anyways so make it all count!

God speed buddy!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It may cost you more than 10k via your credit score tanking, but that‚Äôs the game we play"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Being laid off from my longterm corporate 3 years ago, getting into debt fixing up my parents house for them when it was about to get condemned, and struggling to get a job during the pandemic to make ends meet makes me an impulsive child? Ok, thanks."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I said to myself ""this f@ƒ£ƒü¬§t has to be an /r/politics user""... sure as shit. I was right.

Why are all of you over there such fucking narcissistic, unempathetic, deranged, autistic fuckwads?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir this is the autism foundation how do you want your hotdog prepared with or with the special sauces
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Booooo! You suck man, lacking no autistic existential  appreciation of bullshit laws in the great land of the free and equal equality."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Please don't wait to long. History has a way of repeating its self. Get out when it feels right. Pigs get fat hogs get slaughtered
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are less retarded than I thought. My blessings to you. Also, have you considered adopting a gorilla?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You realize they can (and likely will) liquidate your RH account right?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Im filing chapter 7 too due to because of 150k of surgeries from a bad auto accident. Hopefully it doesn't dick me down too hard.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I will pray for you at church ‚õ™Ô∏è, best of luck üôè"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Doesn't bankruptcy stay on your credit report for 10 years?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,">h this bro. I've heard some crazy stories about bankruptcy courts going after assets and gains from things that were less than 2 years old but it sounds like you have a lawyer so good on you.

This is the Way"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Last week*.  We purposely waited to file until my portfolio was at its lowest and at a morning dip.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Get a new attorney!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just incase the lambo breaks down , you need a credit card to rent a car from enterprise! üòÇ"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Credit is way more important then cash ! Cash can disappear over night !  I just leased a new car 2 months ago with no job ! Cause my credit is 800 .... credit is important, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs not !"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way. I refuse to pay interest on shit (besides a margin account). I've bought all my cars in cash.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Still lol just go mad negative at that point
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've gotten a dozen ""pre-approved"" for $35k in car loans solely because I filed. They make great firestarters. First thing I did when I got one of the letters was call them up and politely asked the rep to remove me from their solicitation lists, since I was so chill he went and removed me from their other contact databases too. Now idk how to start fires with the entire lack of junk mail, sigh."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I truly wish everything works out to the best for you. I was just wondering... As far as living out of a van, I heard it‚Äôs not too bad and having a gym membership helps so you can shower in there(little gas stoves help, but you might not want to winter in a van if you‚Äôre in cold climates). Good luck, and I hope those GME gains buys you a house and settles all your debts with an excess of capital so you can accomplish all of your dreams."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"*files for bankruptcy*   
""this is going better than expected"""
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotcha
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You filed bankruptcy too quick in my opinion. Let them sue you. In my state you can only pay a judgement for one debt at a time. Let one sue you, tell the judge you can only afford $25 a month, and it‚Äôll buy you time until GME moons again (still?). The other creditors will have to get in line. 

Plus, the egg will be on your face if you‚Äôre trading on margin and suddenly owe your broker money that can‚Äôt be bankrupted. 

Save that shit for when you really do something retarded!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, if your wife's boyfriend is looking out for you, I'll have to take your word for it."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do you say it will be back to 700 in 18-24 months?  And how?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It was after the real estate bubble. You think it was better than pandemic we are going through now? I tried to work for 3 years with no success. Had to wait on tables during nights. Please stop giving excuses.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Such a cunt! So you think the big banks don‚Äôt pass those costs on to the customer? The fact that you‚Äôre proud of declaring bankruptcy and wearing it like a badge of honour speaks volumes. I hope it doesn‚Äôt work out.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have an attorney retained we were mostly waiting until after I get taxes and the stimulus. Idaho has some low exemptions. I could just throw all the money into my 401k and have it not touchable, but I'd at least like to to lose that money in a way where I have easy access to it if I needed it, wasn't saving it for nothing. Worst case scenario I gift it out to friends and family under the amount that needs to be reported, rather they get it then the banks that have already been paid 2 fold over time, and the overpriced medical care."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You racked up $40k in credit card debt? What will be different over the next 18-24 months that will allow you to build your credit back to 700? Change in income? Change in habits? Not judging, just curious as I know nothing about bankruptcy."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao I don't think it's a crime when ""planning"" to get rich off gme investing longterm."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm only experienced at spending and losing money.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Red 5 is the real winner.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This comment is scary, yet liberating at the same time"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was already tanked, it can only go up from here!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro I don‚Äôt think you understand the meaning of filing for bankruptcy. I‚Äôm confident 100 percent of the people file for it to save money not their credit score. 

If they had money to protect their credit by making payments they wouldn‚Äôt file for bankruptcy"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Many, many, many people live paycheck to paycheck. Even people in very wealthy areas. I have seen so many foreclosures on extremely expensive homes where the owner only recently lost their job. No one thinks it will happen to them until it does.  


Don't think for one second you are the only person going through this, most people just don't talk about it. You will be back on your feet in no time. Best of luck to you, dude. Also, Flrg808 is a dipshit."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Based on what you sold, yes. I can only imagine how much more overpriced junk you have funded by credit cards. Also getting laid off 3 years ago has nothing to do with the pandemic and if you had money to gamble on GME you could‚Äôve paid off the credit card debt you racked up. But hey, someone else‚Äôs problem now right?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,They take your stocks and assets in bankruptcy lol
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,With or with I'm gonna use that lmao
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck off bot
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I will after I'm not living out of my car
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Only total capital assets above the $14k wildcard limit at time of filing. Source - my bankruptcy attorney.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Make sure you have a good attorney to help you decide which chapter to file based on your finances and if bankruptcy is the best course of action. Bankruptcy is no joke.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,7 years.  OP is a clueless idiot.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Silly ape, that‚Äôs why you make enough to have a backup lambo lol"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I also have 795 credit score and credit is not important. It‚Äôs only important because we‚Äôre told that it is.

Cash is always going to be greater than any credit, while yes credit can be useful when properly managed. But most people fall into its traps and get stuck with no way out."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The act of bankruptcy settles the debts in itself.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Way better than expected so far lol. Sure beats those pesky creditor lawsuits.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,One of the creditors served me a pocket file (state specific thing) lawsuit for $7600. 4 more were in line to file. My attorney and I decided based on my circumstances it was a good time to file.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It essentially resets your credit like you're 18 again, so I'll get a credit card with a $500 limit and pay it off every month like I did when 18"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You know nothing of my circumstances or anything about me. Please fuck off.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, my attorney basically just said buy shit and/or put in an IRA if too much over"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It was due to getting laid off 3 years ago. Bankruptcy is basically resetting your credit like you're 18 years old again. I'd get a $500 limit credit card and pay it off every month like I did when I was 18.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hang in there man , with your balls im sure you will be back on your feet in no time !"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"That mindset is the reason our world is already damaged beyond repair.

edit: Wow, actual downvotes. Maybe the world is fucked either way if you retards are the future. Thank god I'm not a fucking American, 2020 was a great glimpse into the future there."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally can‚Äôt go tits up
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had a six figure job 3 years ago and was paying off my debt on time every month. I never thought it would happen to me. Yeah people can definitely be judgemental assholes sometimes, I don't mind the haters. Thanks man"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you really chose to double down on being a rude cunt towards OP huh. You know nothing about their circumstances, just apologise and move on"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was a photographer and inspiring music producer, but in January I realized I'd probably make more money investing this year than those career paths, so I got back in the market after a 12 year hiatus. I'm not gambling on gme, I'm putting everything on the line in an act of desperation because I haven't been able to get a job back in corporate IT. I have absolutely no sympathy for large banks that charge 20% APR on credit cards and indebt the American people."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought all my ""toys"" in cash years ago."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Also most of the debt was neccesary building materials for renovating my parents house.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"In chapter 7 yes they liquidate non-exempt assets above the 14k wildcard limit, depending on state."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You're literally In bankruptcy gambling bro. Money can be made but what are you going to do if that shit falls to the floor. At least hedge an buy a put
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You will have to state under oath that everything in your filing is accurate. If gme goes higher before your bankruptcy is finalized you‚Äôll be lying in court, which your attorney will tell you is a big no no. You can‚Äôt hide assets in a bankruptcy, and that‚Äôs essentially what you‚Äôll be doing. This is no different than you filing bankruptcy and then having a family member give you 100k cash to put in your bank account. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have the money when I filed so we‚Äôre good right?‚Äù Won‚Äôt cut it in bankruptcy court. The judge will want to see that you are unable to pay your debts at the time of his ruling, and he could throw it out altogether or request that you file chapter 11 instead."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Chapter 7 is 10 years. Chapter 13 is 7 years.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This can be the way !
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What color backup lambo should I get?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The problem with cash though is it can be gone literally over night , so my opinion is credit does play a part ... try to get a mortgage for a house with no credit! They don‚Äôt care if you got cash in the bank ! They wanna see your credit and income.... I bought a condo in Florida in cash for 54 grand in 2011 when prices were rock bottom, first thing the condo wanted to see was my credit score and income to make sure I could afford to pay the maintenance fees !"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh I thought 7 was partial and 11 was full? Sorry, I was unaware. May we get that plane money from our positions!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Doubt it.  But ok.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I think I kind of do. You keep making excuses for your shortcomings. Good job üëç
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,No one twisted your arm mate
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had to file for bankruptcy myself after I had been laid off for an extended time period.  I was really worried about the stigma associated with it and how my credit score would be ruined forever.  Turns out, it was the best decision I ever made.  A couple months after filing, I got a new job making a lot more money than I did before, with zero debt.  And it only took a couple of years to rebuild my credit score.  Best of luck to you brother ape. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåô"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha. Thanks! Best of luck with everything. You seem to have a positive outlook, you got this!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I already have enough for the van to live down by the river!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,With balls like that who need feet.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"America is the standard at which all other currencies are weighed against so I‚Äôm not sure how your comment means anything. Although I‚Äôm 100% against debt(aside from my mortgage) carrying it is the new normal. The economies around the world are adapting to this. It‚Äôll all be fine. But probably not fair to point the finger at America, look at what other countries are doing around the world."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre preaching on the wrong subreddit. Hence the downvotes. Don‚Äôt attack other people because nobody likes you getting on your soapbox.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Does tits up mean dead or am I just retarded
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I read this a year ago.  Saved it.  It helped.  Best of luck as you put this behind you and move forward.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whoops, Aspiring*.  Total retard moment"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I dunno man - ‚Äúputting everything on the line in an act of desperation‚Äù doesn‚Äôt sound like the best move to me here
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol you‚Äôre story is all over the place so I‚Äôm not going to waste my time replying to anything you said, all I know is filing bankruptcy with an investment account full of cash is pathetic. Why the fuck do you think CC rates are 20% to begin with?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro, do you even know bankruptcy law? Because my attorney does. Fuck off."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Again, fuck off bot. Do you know what sub you‚Äôre in? This is prime fucking content, top notch. Good shit OP"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Worst case scenario, gme moons and I'll be able to afford to pay all my debts and not finalize the bankruptcy."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everything in my filing is accurate when I filed last week at the time of filing. I'm not hiding anything. My attorney says it should be fine. What are they going to do, watch the gme ticker on a minute by minute basis to determine the ruling?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Even better for this scumbag deadbeat we call OP
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,üòπüòπüòπ
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You think filing chapter 7 is funny.  I‚Äôm gonna sell my crappy equipment and put it into GME hurr hurrrr.  You won‚Äôt be getting a loan on the primary market for 7 straight years pal.  It isn‚Äôt funny.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt know why you keep saying cash can disappear over night, I mean yeah technically, but so can the earth and the sun. You‚Äôre going need to clarify in what instance is cash going to disappear over night.

I can‚Äôt speak to your condo instance because I don‚Äôt know the specifics.

But houses can be bought cash, investors were doing that during the housing crash when credit was non existent. I don‚Äôt think anyone is going to care if I have a 500 credit score when I have a million in my bank account and wanting to buy a 300k house cash."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you have the cash in the bank for the house, no one cares what your credit looks like, because you are paying cash.

To suggest otherwise is to imply credit has more value than money in hand. Which would be retarded beyond even WSB levels.

Why would you want a ""debt until death"" the literal meaning of mortgage as translated from French."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am pretty sure that they can't require either of those at that point, in case you had wanted to refuse.  Association-imposed conditions for home purchase basically never hold up.  I never consent to a credit check unless for something where they can legally require it, which is a minority of situations.

Edit for typo."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Any bankruptcy wipes out all unsecured debt. Chapter 7 is liquidation of assets above 14k to pay debts, chapter 11 is essentially a payback plan to pay debts."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your doubt means shit, the OP is correct. 

Fortunately for the rest of us living in the real world, how stuff works doesn't revolve around your faith or doubt."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Take your doubt and shove your wife dildo up your black hole
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was scared shitless about it too before I talked to a bankruptcy attorney, which cleared up all my worries and misconceptions that society has placed on it."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I been there bro !
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes and yes
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It wasn't that full of cash..Last week..

That option is literally there to help the lowest earning citizens get a fresh start so that they can avoid the mental and personal stress that comes with a huge pile of debt -- which can be crushing. He is trying to hold on to the last morsel he could scrape up, and escape the snowballing momentum of poverty in the US. Make no mistake there is a huge poor tax, and the effects of poverty build on each other, creating worse and worse situations.

It's misused by people with millions trying to reduce taxes and shift around huge amounts of assets into shady locales - the Trumps of the world. He is using it exactly as he should, to protect a sum of money which is not enough to nudge a rich person out of bed, but which is enough to hopefully provide him a fresh start and ensure he can reenter the credit system successfully - adding more benefit to society than he would've as a mentally crushed dishwasher.

You have no idea of what support system, family, housing options he has, you just want other people to live in a pile of shit because you did.

Plus, the lowest jobs which you mention are Chronically underpaid and don't provide adequate healthcare. It's entering a vicious cycle with the intent to escape a vicious cycle - understanding the system hopefully works to his benefit and hopefully provides him an escape route."

I have found only a couple of situations over the years where there the law was not on my side.

Edit:  As far as HOA, you can immediately shift things in your favor by asserting your authority over them.  As soon as you move in, request the last couple of years financial records for the association, which they legally have to give you, as well as the projections for this year.  Keep on top of their expenses.  Don't get too petty, but start questioning everything.  These places do a lot of shady things, and don't expect to be called out on it."
2021-03-14 06:16:03,wallstreetbets,"NIO - Bull-case investment Thesis, plus Crazy OG-style WSB ""Bet"" Smart Nio investors trade on catalysts. If you guys read my DD on NIO before the NIO Day Catalyst, you would've bought in at 38 and sold around 60 (I sold calls, but still holding my shares).

Now, there are two new catalysts that are arguably even greater than the announcements at Nio Day.

**1) Energy**  
On Nio Day, William Li announced a second-generation Battery Swap station, where users don't even have to leave their cars. The stations are also a lot cheaper to operate, with greater capacity. They can complete about 312 battery swaps per day.

Imagine a world where Battery Stations replace Gas stations. What would that say about Nio? And what would happen to gas stations?

Well early February, William Li met with Sinopec's CEO. Sinopec is one of the largest oil and chemicals companies in the world (2nd globally according to Forbes). They have over 30,000 gas stations. Here's the kicker: There are not so subtle rumors that Sinopec gas station will incorporate Nio Battery Swap Stations. Nio plans to have 500 battery swap stations by the end 2021, some of which may be at Sinopec's stations. The growth in revenue will accelerate.

**Imagine if NIO's main source of revenue was from selling energy, rather than just cars.**

It'll send Nio's share price to the moon.

**2) Hong Kong Stock Exchange**  
Nio plans to list in the Hong Kong stock exchange around April. XPEV and LI will also be added. This is great news for Nio's stock price. An announcement about BABA listing on the HK stock exchange (around November 2019) led to its share price rising from 185 to 300 in three months.

The same will happen to Nio, and even more so, because Li and Xpev's rise will bring Nio up even more due to their coupling in various EV-related ETF's.

Watch out for an announcement in April.

**Other thoughts:** I've noticed, increasingly, that puts bought for the purpose of hedging positions are now mostly be applied to index ETF's like SPY and QQQ. Why? Because GME's short squeeze drama nearly killed several hedge funds. Sentiment Analysis has become a household name, and all the major hedge funds track WallStreetBets to avoid stocks that are too popular. Nio is one of those stocks that boomer hf's realize is one of the popular ones on ""reddit"". Google ""top reddit stocks"" and you'll see Nio routinely mentioned (this is also why I think stocks like PLTR will no longer suffer for too long).

Also Mizuho announced a Nio PT at $60, and Deutsche Bank recently released a memo stating that Nio can reach $70 in the near term. These things tell me that both retail and hedge funds are united in loving NIO stonk. We might be clear for another takeoff.

**3) What to Do**  
The dates on these catalysts are not announced like Nio Day was. All I know is that it'll happen sometime in the next few months. To play it safe, I would buy call leaps. My price target is 70-80 by EOY. Also, load up shares on dips and sell covered calls each time we reach new highs. I plan to diamond hand Nio, as I believe it'll reach higher than $300 in five years. I'll be buying/selling calls, but not sell my shares.

**4) Community Boost**  
If NIO passes $70 per share by eod, April 16, I'll donate to charity and post as an update. I don't want to virtue signal, but I hope it encourages some people on here to think about their community. I was inspired to do this by other WSBers that donated to the Food Bank with some of their GME earnings, so for that, thank you, and I hope I too can pass on the kindness.

**TLDR** \- NIO is likely to partner with the world's second largest Oil Company this year and have their newly designed battery swap stations operate in gas stations, thus Nio might actually make more money as an energy provider than a car company. Also, Nio will be listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which has helped stocks like BABA go to the moon in the past.

**TLDR** \- I'll donate to charity if NIO‚Äôs passes $70 per share by April 16."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't like NIO because battery-swapping is ultimately a dead-end.

There are several reasons and they interweave with each other but here is some brief info...

1. Building a swappable battery, means you are building an inferior car. That means additional cost and weight in how the car is built. Additional weight means less range (and more wear on the car, such as shorter tire-life).
2. As EV range is increasing, the choice to buy a better car with a non-swappable battery versus an inferior one with a swappable battery becomes clearer. Consumers will choose cars that are built better.
3. Swap stations are relatively complex, that will need regular service, and likely need an attendant in addition to issues with where they are located. Charging stalls on the other hand, can be placed anyplace where you have sufficient electrical capacity. They can be put curb-side where people park their cars. There is no real need for dedicated land devoted to charging.
4. Newer EV batteries are faster to charge, making the time to charge versus swap a non-significant issue.

Think about it. For a given price point you can have a car that performs better, weighs less, and has more range versus getting a car with a swappable battery. If the concern is lack of places to charge, then the car with the swappable battery will still need to deal with swapping batteries more often then you charge. If the concern is that on a longer-range trip you don't want to waste time charging, well you still are dealing with less range to begin with, with a swappable battery.

Bottom line, both from a practical standpoint and a price standpoint, battery swapping is a dead-end. It might be necessary as a stop-gap, so possible room for Nio's solution for the time being, but just don't see it being a thing in a few years.

I am considering Puts for Jan 2022. My one concern is that I have no way to time when investors realize NIO's current approach is a dead-end. I would not think someone like Hindenburg will come in and trash them, since they are a legit company with a legit product. Rather, my issue is, the product is not going to be the success investors hope it will be."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I bet you never lived in East. You have no idea how important battery swapping is when you have such highly populated cities. You think people would want to spend 30 min. at a charging station or on a curb side blocking 3000 other people behind them? Or do you think everyone has a house with a driveway or a garage with electric fitting to charge overnight? Battery swapping is a necessity until flash charging technology doesn't take over.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for your comments. I'd love to respond to this:

>from a practical standpoint and a price standpoint, battery swapping is a dead-end. It might be necessary as a stop-gap, so possible room for Nio's solution for the time being, but just don't see it being a thing in a few years.

""Battery Tech"" - Nio has been investing and r & d'ing heavily into battery tech. Nio's new ET7 sedan which was presented on Nio Day, will have solid state batteries that charge in less than 10-minutes and have a range of over 1000km. This will make Nio the first EV car company in the world to release a sedan with solid state batteries!

""Battery Swap""  Your comments seem to imply that Nio only does battery swap. Not true. Nio has power charging stations too. They're mobile phone operated. Also, if you buy a Nio, you don't have to battery swap at all. If you do opt in to BaaS, then the car is over $10K cheaper to buy, because you don't have to pay for the battery, you'd be leasing it.

""Better Batteries will replace the need for Battery Swap"" Not at the moment. Even the best solid state batteries have limited cycles compared to liquid lithium ion batteries. Battery swap will prevent customers from having to buy expensive batteries after the cycle limit is reached. Nio's BaaS is great for the customer because they don't have to buy expensive batteries every 8-10 years. It's great for Nio because they collect a subscription fee and generate revenue whether or not they sell new cars. 

Hope these address your concerns. All I can say though is, even if you disagree with everything I say, please think of your family and do not buy puts. Just trust me bro, it would be one of the worst decisions you'd make in your life."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"NYC can put many curb side charging stations that you pay to park your car overnight at while it charges.

Garages (not your private one) in plenty of cities have charging stalls and can expand that as well.

The link below is just a start (in NYC).

[https://nycdotprojects.info/project/839/overview](https://nycdotprojects.info/project/839/overview)

As to flash charging that is ridiculous. Lucid is claiming they can charge 20 miles per minute. The Model 3 with a 250 kW charger can charge 15 miles per minute (with the upcoming 4680 cells the max charge rate will be significantly higher due to the lower electrical resistance). Now we don't need to talk about charging to 100% rather if I have a price competitive car that at about 85% of range has the same range as Nio's offering, then all I need to know is how long it takes to charge to 85% to see how inconvenient this is. Assuming we can get 25 miles of charge per minute, then a Nio swappable batter that gives you 200 miles of range, would be equivalent to charging about 150 miles of range (you are not swapping your battery at 0 miles of range left, more likely something between 25-75 miles), which would be 6 minutes.

But really the whole issue is moot, as cities will provide slow curb-side charges that you can park by over night (for a fee).

Like, I said, what Nio is doing might be useful now as a stop-gap, but long-term, IMO, it is a dead-end."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The ET7, with a 100 kW (not solid-state) battery that should be out beginning of next year will cost about the same as a the current price on a Long-Range Model S. They will find the high-end category for EV sedans might be a little more competitive then they like and doubt they will sell that many. It is a cool car, but don't assume it will be much of a money-maker. Further, Telsa can lower the price on the Model S if demand weakens and still make money, not sure the same can be said about Nio. Again, the swappable design will cost more to make and cars will be worse for it, there is simply no escaping that inherent quality.

The one with the solid-state battery is not due to come out till end of 2022 and no one knows what the price will be. It is a 150 kWh pack supposedly. Regarding your concern about solid-state cycle life, it makes no sense what you say. The end cost is ultimately more to the customer if the battery has a shorter life. It does not matter if you lease or buy. Unless Nio is not making money.

As to choice of leasing or buying the battery, it is irrelevant. In both cases you are making the car worse and more costly to build to have battery swapping. Nothing about the way the car is built changes, rather just something about how the ownership aspect of the battery changes.

FYI, regarding solid-state claims. Until they demonstrate the tech, you should assume it is vaporware.  Right now the only company I have any degree of confidence in that they might actually get a solid-state battery out in the next few years is quantumscape and even there it is not certain. I am extremely skeptical of the claim that Nio has a battery partner ready to mass produce solid-state batteries for the end of 2022. These claims are marketing designed to reassure jittery investors. Toyota, also is suggesting they will have a solid-state car out soon, and again, until you demonstrate a viable solid-state battery, I assume it is vapor-ware."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Valid points but even if accurate one would still assume a short term bullish position on this one
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You make good arguments.   
One thing--leasing a battery would allow the customer to pay much less up front for their vehicle, and it would offset the cost of a damaged battery and or one that has reached its cycle limit. 

I agree with you regarding the solid-state battery claims, and I'm actually invested in Quauntumscape, so I'm following the news on it carefully. You're definitely not alone about the ""vaporware"" claims, which is all the more reason why Solid-state battery claims by Nio will not be priced-in until after the release of the ET7 in 2022. If it does work as advertised, imagine the euphoria. Obviously as a Nio investor, I'm quite optimistic, but we shall see."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I realized what I said might be misinterpreted, if you‚Äôre donating to say....the Arian brotherhood or Boko Haram you might want to keep that to yourself"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I appreciate this so much
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"My original comment was that I was considering puts for Jan 2022 and even that I don't think is a guaranteed investment. It is factored to some extent on people seeing the new products out of the Texas and Berlin Tesla factories and then understanding the bigger picture better. The thing is, for all Tesla's crazy fast work building the factories (watch the drone videos of the Texas factory, it is incredible stuff whether you like Tesla or not), I always take with many grains of salt production timelines. Everyone, seems  to overpromise."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The thing with the lease structure is at the end of the day is just a payment structure. Total cost of owning the vehicle is more important as that will ultimately determine in a competitive environment how it can be priced.

I also have a sizable investment in Quantumscape (have a larger position in Telsa, and also have a few puts on RIDE/Lordstown Motors... considering puts on GOEV/Canoo, if I free up some cash... Nio is further down my list). QS, assuming the technology pans out (and seems that it might just work out), still has major challenges getting to mass production. If they can get that, definitely see QS increasing in value 10X+ over the next decade.

Glad you understand to be skeptical about solid-state claims. Agree if Nio does come out with a vehicle with it at a price that it is competitive, then the stock will go vertical."
2021-03-14 06:12:52,wallstreetbets,Grabbed this baby ape on the way to the moon!!! No apes left behind! Third try on this lol. To the moon GME üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üåô

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are we seeing a lot of the same ape names on different posts? Are many donations going to the same apes? So it‚Äôs not literally adopt a gorilla?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I am omw to adopt monke now
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,She is 3 years old and doing well!!!

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I saw this same ape on onlyfans
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Odd. Multiple of you have adopted this same gorilla. Same name and pic.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck yeah bud!!!!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Stimmy time!  LFG!!!!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs symbolic bro. There‚Äôs only like 6-7 to choose from.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's the same concept as adopting a highway. You don't have to feed it, put it to bed, or comfort it when it comes home from school crying becsuse Matt, the school bully, pantsed it in front of its crush, Lauren, and showed everyone that it has a tiny dick. Even though it tried explaining that it's just cold, they didn't care they just kept laughing. But rather you're giving money to make sure it's taken care of"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can't believe how many people seem to think if they donate 150 bucks, Chewy mails them a gorilla"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,God damn right !!!  Lets run it up!!!!

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Heh
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok so its meant to be the same few gorillas just getting more support then I take it? Thats good. Literal GME apes always welcome.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,So how does this adoption actually work? Seems like a bunch of adoptions have been repeated.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm a simple man: I see apes helping apes, I smash upvote button."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Man can't wait to see apes on lambos when GME goes to 420690 ea.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got Urungano too, world's first trust fund gorilla"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Urungano just seemed like the most Chad ape on there to me. Easy decision
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bruh, how many ppl have adopted urungano? I've seen a half dozen posts saying they adopted urungano.  That fucking gorilla is sitting there writing letters to old ladies about being the prince of nigeria and if she would only send him $300 he could reclaim his throne and would send a $5 mil check to say thanks. Making bank."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Is your last name Schitt? If so- I understand you. Apes together strong.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,why is urungano up for adoption multiple times.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This has nothing to do with WSB or GME. It's a joke trying to play on emotions to get people to sell.

Edited for grammar"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I picture someone from the charity walking by all the other apes and dropping 500 bananas into just Urangano‚Äôs cage. ‚ÄúNo no Brango. Don‚Äôt touch those. No one has donated money to you. Hopefully you get to eat tomorrow‚Äù.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"they posted a twitter update, $70k in donations today!!!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Over 100k at this point. They‚Äôre gonna release a video showing WSB around at all the apes. :)
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,$100k now
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Citadel probably owns the gorilla fund lol
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs just symbolic, it‚Äôs basically a donation that lets you follow an ape. It‚Äôs like buying a share of an ape, if you will."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"the free float of gorillas is probably in the negatives right now, will probably encounter some failure to delivers!!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's common in these kind of ""adoptions"" to have multiple people support the same animal. 

It would be far too expensive for one person to bear the costs of a wild animal as they need constant protection (against poachers), and often food, Healthcare, maintainers, etc. When you adopt (or more accurately sponsor) and animal, you donate some money (one off or regularly) and receive updates about one specific animal, that you support along with others."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you are the first to adopt one they mail it directly to you, but if someone else adopts the same one you have to mail it to them. Kind of like king of the hill with gorillas."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs like onlyfans for apes tho
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"
There‚Äôs only so many gorillas to go around"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I visited this center in Malaysia. Let's grow the family.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a symbolic gesture. The Diane Fossey Foundation does seem like a legit organization, though I'm not sure how the funds get allocated."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre not actually adopting him. You‚Äôre sponsoring his protection and maintenance needs. Basically like buying a share lol.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah just people who have taken profits (whether from options or selling stock)  putting some of their money to good use.   Its not like we're seeing ""sold all my gme to adopt this beautiful ape posts""   

Its also around tax time which means that a lot of people who have made money over the last year can make charitable donations offsetting taxes."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Urungano has a legacy of a legend to carry on ü¶çüçå

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Calls on $APE I guess
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah makes sense
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is just like GME, you buy a share and hodl it but there are no shorts involved. Just apes supporting apes"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Just like GME shares

little fucker has more parents than most of us"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here i am, laughing my ass off at the idea of them dropping off a gorilla or someone's doorstep, like he's your problem now, watch put for poachers!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I saw that is insanly cool
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,And then they shorted bananas just out of spite.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,They have been shorted for too long by the fucking poachers!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The apes are not in captivity. They are protected and cared for in the wild. Pretty sure the very first post had the letter from them saying that they are observed infrequently to maintain their way of life. This is one of the reasons why they are so highly rated as an org.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Each gorilla has like a profile picture I guess. Look at the names of the apes, you are seeing the same picture because more than one person can ‚Äúadopt‚Äù the same ape and a bunch of people have chose this specific guy"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can we give them the weekend to get some new pics?

Edit: a typo"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, or hugs... that's way more wholesome than what I tought that sentence would end with."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bonobos are matriarchal, polyamorous, and bisexual."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The chance may be low but it‚Äôs never zero
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"They use sex for conflict resolution and orgies for group bonding. They‚Äôre also matriarchal. How different the world might be if we‚Äôd discovered bonobos first and decided that sex and queens were human nature and not the violent, infant-eating, murder apes; the chimps."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,He'd make the purrfect director.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"They‚Äôre also really into gay sex:

> Bonobos form a matriarchal society, unusual among apes. They are fully bisexual: both males and females engage in hetero- and homosexual behavior, being noted for female‚Äìfemale sex in particular,[83] including between juveniles and adults.[84] Roughly 60% of all bonobo sexual activity occurs between two or more females. While the homosexual bonding system in bonobos represents the highest frequency of homosexuality known in any primate species, homosexuality has been reported for all great apes (a group which includes humans), as well as a number of other primate species.[85][86][87][88][89]

> Dutch primatologist Frans de Waal, who extensively observed and filmed bonobos, believed that sexual activity is the bonobo's way of avoiding conflict. Anything that arouses the interest of more than one bonobo at a time, not just food, tends to result in sexual contact. If two bonobos approach a cardboard box thrown into their enclosure, they will briefly mount each other before playing with the box. Such situations lead to squabbles in most other species. But bonobos are quite tolerant, perhaps because they use sex to divert attention and to defuse tension.[84][90]"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a symbolic adoption.  Gives you the right to make your wife's boyfriend a monkey's uncle.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's all racism, I agree."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You would think so, but it doesn't mean that.

Anti-racism, according to critical race theory, is essentially the idea that the way to counter the effects of racism is with more racism."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is wholesome
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly that makes a lotta sense to me lol
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't call something like White Fragility or Ta-Nehisis Coates' work critical race theory. Critical race theory is just taking critical theory and adding a race dimension.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"my indian friend calls me indian cause i believe in reincarnation, can i sleep with your wife too?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,">Honestly that makes a lotta sense to me lol

Meaning you comprehend it or you agree with it? Critical race theory is an extremely regressive ideology that goes counter to the liberal idea that individuals should be judged based on their merits, not their race. Critical race theory would see a return to racial segregation."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,No true Scotsman fallacy. Those works are applications of critical race theory.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,">the liberal idea that individuals should be judged based on their merits, not their race.

The thing is: systemic discrimination (not just racism, but also poverty and sexism) prevents way too many people from even coming close to their potential. Meritocracy only works when everyone has at least a somewhat similar starting point in life."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean I thought you had a good point but I think you‚Äôre taking it a little far.
I‚Äôm no fan of critical race theory though."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If that's how you're going to define it then CRT is racist, in the sense that it reifies race, and has very little do do with early Critical Theory. I'm not going to defend Robin D'Angelo."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Anti-racism creates more systemic discrimination, not less."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It's what some people believe in unfortunately

Edit2: Sneks


Ishimwe was born into Mafunzo‚Äôs group on July 16, 2015. His name means ‚Äúpraise‚Äù or ‚Äúgratitude.‚Äù
His father is Mafunzo (who is himself the grandson of Effie) and his mother is Taraja (the daughter of Titus and granddaughter of Uncle Bert).
Ishimwe was the first surviving infant in Mafunzo‚Äôs group, and for that reason the favorite of his father, but there are now also two other gorillas close in age to Ishimwe: Ukwiyunga and Umutware. The three youngsters are inseparable.
Ishimwe initially struggled when his mother gave birth again when he was just three. Taraja gradually pushed Ishimwe to be independent and stopped nursing, but she still cuddled with him for long grooming sessions, which for gorillas is reassuring and calming. He is now a fantastic older brother to Suraurwanda (whose name means ‚Äúvisit Rwanda‚Äù) and was born in November 2018."

I had fingers crossed for a wholesome outcome like co parenting.  Here in Canada there's a massive charity recently involved in scandal called WE.  It's been reported that for years they've been selling the same charity projects to multiple donors.  People donate enough for a water filtration system in Africa and WE changes the nameplate on a system the last guy paid for.  In some cases multiple times.

I have a few points I want to make about theta then hopefully we can put this to rest. I'm not going to talk about Delta or IV that's a different conversation and motherfuckers need to read.

Real quick:

* Not a pro
* Not investment advice
* Advice about how you need to actually learn shit

If you're too retarded to understand basic math or you're too lazy to try to actually better yourself then click the back button now. For the retards that stick around I'll include pictures and a fun little story.

Okay about 3% of you should be left so let's dive in.

# Theta

 The term theta refers to the rate of decline in the [value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/value.asp) of an option due to the passage of time. It can also be referred to as the [time decay](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timedecay.asp) of an option. This means an option loses value as time moves closer to its [maturity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp), **as long as everything is held constant**. Theta is generally expressed as a negative number and can be thought of as the amount by which an option's value declines every day. 

Theta is an estimate of value decay. It's a rate that's continuously adjusted. Every second that passes makes your option worth less and less. The biggest misconception is the one I want to focus on the most. We talk about it it terms expressed in decay on a day I think for our simple brains but it's not that simple just like days aren't really exactly 24 hours and there's complex reasons why.

# THETA. IS. NOT. LINEAR.

You dickheads remember y=mx+b from middle school? that's linear. Here's theta on an option graphed for a 1yr contract.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.optiontradingtips.com\/greeks\/theta.html](https://preview.redd.it/k3zpzuyfzvm61.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=359ec39cb38f082a8ca2fe69f7f562cf2ec441da)

 Theta is exponential. the theta decay on your option accelerates over time. Look at that last little sliver of the chart. See how sharp it goes down? That's 'FD' range. That's when all the value of the option evaporates nearly instantly like your wife's interest in you when she met her boyfriend.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.optiontradingtips.com\/greeks\/theta.html](https://preview.redd.it/br6wnmc31wm61.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=63e4ca62032511a0b8e3ee2e43feed83b645def8)

# Theta will eat your lunch

Last week I had a C250 FD on GME that I had to close on a loss even though it was ITM. WHY? Because the rate of decay on the option was so fast that GME **wasn't rising fast enough to increase the value of the option and make up the difference**. Buying OTM and going ITM is good but it's important to understand that even IF you are ITM it still won't save you from theta and sometimes it's smarter to take profit rather than waiting. **You COULD even take the profit and buy the underlying**...

# Retard/Ape edition incase you're somehow still here

You live in Loserville and want to move to TendieTown. The distance is 1000 miles. You have 1 work week to get there( 5 days). So first thing you realize is that you can travel 200 miles per day and you'll get there on time. Great. Say you take Monday off. Suddenly you need to travel 250 miles per day. Not impossible but okay that's not a fun speed to move at. Take note it's a 25% increase. Let's say again on the second day there's no 'movement'. Now you need to cover the same 1000 miles in 3 days. Okay now you're looking at 333.3 miles. That's a 33.33% increase from the previous day. Holy shit now you need to fucking move and move fast. But let's say for one reason or another you, ""**G**ary **M**ichael **Edward**"" can't get out of bed on Wednesday. Still have 1000 miles to travel. Now you need to cover that distance in 2 days with an average velocity toward your goal at 500 miles per day. That's a 50% increase from the previous day. And on the last day you need to do all 1000, which is a 100% increase from the previous day.

This is a gross over simplification but it at least gets point across.

Do you guys get it now? Every day without progress makes the goal much more unlikely because the burden just shifts and grows exponentially to the remainder of time. As the likelihood of the open hitting ITM increases and time passes, theta acts as a decaying agent on the price bringing it into balance.

* Please stop reading option tutorials from plumbers / dog walkers / high school teachers
* Please read about these concepts on actual investing websites and not the worlds Instagram of trading addiction or watch video from actual professional investors
* If someone tells you they're not a pro/ are retarded think twice about letting them explain shit to you.
* Read a book motherfucker

FD's made this casino notorious because people who were here well before I was started posting crazy yolo FD's -  who knew how acidic theta was and still bought and occasionally made disgusting returns.  


Good luck everyone. I know all you are going to pump FD's with your stimmy so I guess just have fun and please try to learn how to read."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Explained very well. Brain got more wrinkles than my ballsack
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro how tf would I remember y=mx+b when I‚Äôve done enough ecstasy to OD a rhinoceros. Can you just tell me if I‚Äôm going to the moon or not? That would be much simpler.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"What makes me laugh and also a little sad is I see this reading rainbow bullshit posts about how options are so simple and they badly explain how they work and it gets massive upvotes and visibility and I'm here trying to actually give people real facts and not bullshit them and to tell them to do research to develop concrete understanding and this post will struggle by comparison. But hey, I did my best. what are ya gonna do."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is great. To piggyback - I took these screenshots Friday because I think they could help people better understand how they‚Äôre battling charm/ theta on OTM / ATM 0DTE call options on Friday afternoons. You‚Äôre literally losing value by the second. You can see it in the prices/ deltas changing even with the stock price at essentially the same level. 

Hopefully it helps someone!

https://imgur.com/gallery/ys3yViA

Also- a million different forces are in the market at any one time so there‚Äôs no way to use options to completely predict price action. BUT by Friday mid-day, if there hasn‚Äôt been a big spike in a stock yet it‚Äôs *unlikely* to occur that afternoon. Ie GME this Friday. As soon as it started to retreat from $290 level the chance of it recovering became super small because dealers were unwinding their hedges on the enormous amounts of >$300 calls as delta declined by the second."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Theta Thata Thita.  The best way to learn options is playing them and watching yourself lose your ass off.  Then learn why you lost.  There are websites like optionsprofitcalculator . com that can help you.  Probably similar ones to that as well.  Itll show you profit/loss in a particular expiration date and strike youre interested in.  Time decay is yuge.   Especially with slow movement.  Trust me, ive been doing options for 2 months now.  Im an expert.  I stayed at a Holiday Day Inn Express"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The amount of people I see holding 3/19 800cs under the assumption that they're going to increase in value as the price of GME goes up next week is absurd. Thank you for explaining this to people.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"TL;DR

If you are buying options on GME then you are fucking retarded and deserve to lose all your money.  Just give me your money instead.  There was a time when it was appropriate to buy GME options - that was the last 2 weeks of Feb when the price had been at \~$50 for weeks.  NEVER BUY OPTIONS ON A STOCK THAT HAS ALREADY RIPPED UPWARD >50%.

Reposting this for clarity.

 **Options 101 for Noobs**

1. Stick to buying calls and puts.
2. Always buy In The Money (ITM).
3. Always buy expiration dates a minimum of 1-2 months out or greater.
4. Never buy options with implied volatility (IV) higher than 90%.
5. Always sell your options before they expire.
6. Never yolo more than 20% of your capital on one play.
7. If you don‚Äôt understand even one of these points, you are not ready to trade options.

This *IS* financial advice."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You called?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Think about IV affects the option price though, for a heavily shorted stock a few million dollars in calls can force puts to cover if they are very far OTM.  RN, the IV for GME is 500%+ on many OTM calls making them ridiculously expensive.  Once this IV flattens it can be very cheap to purchase far OTM calls.  Through this 'gamma squeeze' attack we are discovering we are learning OTM calls can raise a stock's price if it's heavily shorted.  Conventional wisdom says this isn't the case in the market but what we're seeing is defying that logic."

Is the assumption that this just won‚Äôt get filled? Obviously that is a wide spread so it would be a white knuckle kind of week."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Which as they unwind their delta edges they're of course selling the underlying thusly depressing the price.  Makes sense.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I gathered that Theta essentially gropes every female in your family. Like Zeus.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Zeus disguised himself as a vibrator, fucked Theta, and she gave birth to GME."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly I read so much about options but when I actually started theta stuff I started really small because yeah. You learn a lot when you actually start doing things but it's best to be really cautious when you're learning imo.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've no interest in losing my ass, which is why I'm learning the ropes by writing covered calls on a $9 stock."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here's the thing those people (mostly but not all, some are option chads) don't understand is this. They are going to 'hodl' all week hoping for a moon mission, but those options were free money to the option seller and will never get hedged against because there is no causal agent that will force the price nearly that high? 

Want to know what causes the price to C800?

10,000 C250
10,000 C280
10,000 C300
8,000 C350
7,500 C400
7,000 C450
6,500 C500
5,500 C550
5,00 C600
4,500 C650
4,000 C700
3,500 C750
And then everyone would profit off C800s IF they sold before end of week. But it would take all those calls stacked before it would get up there. That's some GammaChad shit and right now it's almost certainly not going to happen. But Monday will see an influx of stimulus money so who the fuck knows what they'll do with it.
Shit like that. But do you see it? No, it's like >50% C800. People are stupid as shit when they buy calls."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Spreading some of the gospel
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,what we're seeing is actually(afaik) perfectly logical. The activity in GME is based on massive retail interest + exponentially larger institutional interest. 10's of thousands of options every week. The stock is hot as fuck for action as of late. I did do another post on why far OTM calls are retarded and why ATM/ITM calls are catalytic for a gamma squeeze.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is exactly why I feel, at a minimum, GME will gamma squeeze every month or so once call IV drops and enough retards sweep them up (assuming MOASS doesn‚Äôt happen)"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Correct.. apes get smarter by the day.  Apes learn nu things

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,definitely
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Before I answer this question. Are you talking about a bull call spread?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,did you proof read this before you posted?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"if you have shares then this doesn't really effect you much but I would highly suggest you look into covered calls.

If I was still holding hundreds of GME I would be selling far OTM calls like C700 on a portion of them every week so I could make a profit every week GME doesn't moon. Regardless of your cost basis... even if it's 250 if you sold a call for C700 and got exercised you'd be making minimum of 450/share. Solid profit.

I'm not advising you sell covered calls but I do advise you read about options and covered calls."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's subjective but what my feelings are on the matter are this. When I see a pop in the price and the value explodes it's partly based on the option exceeding expectations. But the prices are constantly adjusted to those new expectations. 

Classic rule is if it's good enough to screenshot it's good enough to sell. I've never followed that rule and been mad afterwards. I've broken it and been mad about not following it though."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,depends what you think is going to happen with the underlying. The only thing you can know with absolute certain is that theta will chip value at a faster rate every day and go parabolic in the last few days to hours.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"From my understanding, correct me if am wrong by the 4/21 you would have no more extrinsic value due to Theta decay as the option expired on that date.

The way I see it all depends on how risk averse you are, if you think there is big pending news between now and say the expiry date that wiill increase volatility and increase the current price  to make up of theta dacay then yes."

For the smooth brain: what I'm saying is that options on GME are too expensive, even with stimmy to force gamma squeeze right now.  But, if everyone waits to buy options with their stimmy until GME falls back to $40-$50 then it will moon again."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes or a credit spread but this one is backwards because the short write has a higher premium than the long buy.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,No I'm retarded
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I don‚Äôt know how to do that.  I‚Äôll get googling on ‚Äúcovered calls‚Äù. Gotta learn some day...

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your comment makes no sense; if GME were to stay at current levels for a month or two, IV would naturally drop"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The down side is a few things. Theta on the call you Bought To Open (BTO) is higher than the one you Sold To Open (STO) so your BTO theta>STO theta which means you need upward price action but you also need that price action to occur at a very specific rate. You need to put your BTO  ITM so you have the highest delta possible (converging very close to one) but if the price moves to quickly upward then your STO is eating your gains via extrinsic value. 

&#x200B;

if you're going to wait it out until friday congrats you have balls but theta doesn't sleep it's still eating so your gains are going to diminish. Best thing I've seen is the wait for the ITM pop on BTO, then close both positions.

worse case price drops and you're BTO goes to nothing and you just straight lose money with no hope of recovery.

&#x200B;

I did a calendar call spread where i STO'd a 3/12 for C350 while I held a C320 3/19. It mitigated a ton of my theta But since price wasn't climbing enough towards like 300ish i lost extrinsic value on my BTO. Hoping we see GME goto like 350 next week but retards have to buy the right calls. Hope that helps you gain perspective"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,">the short write has a higher premium than the long buy

You can stop there, that‚Äôs not reality it‚Äôs just that the $500 strike has a lot more volume (actual price) than the $510 with huge spreads (not actual price)

There‚Äôs no way you‚Äôre going to actually fill a debit spread as a credit, you may have been able to when GME first went crazy in January but it‚Äôs not going to happen in any remotely stable market."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,oh wait you're doing a credit vertical call spread?

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,*me trying not to flinch when a Z-score bares its fangs and hisses at me*
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"From the one who is implying that delta is the driving force of the r/THETAgang, it is simply the measure we use to to choose which stocks to sell options on. We collect premiums against theta. .1 to .3 delta is fucking low moron, a low delta hedges premium risk. At .1 delta if a stock decreases by $1 the option price decreases by $0.10, the higher the delta the larger the premium swings which is bad for those cashing in on THETA gains which are time dependent. Many of us close our options at 50% premium gain. THAT is the thetagang way."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"IV is based on options open interest.  People buy deep OTM calls and deep OTM puts then that equates IV.  The only way IV drops is if everyone closes their poaitionsnand start buying positions much closer to strike.  

This is why IV is *implied* and not natural.  It's implied by what options people are buying and where.  As long as you have people betting that GME will drop to $40 and people betting it'll moon to $800 IV will remain ridiculous.

Edit to add that this is why IV is game able if you have enough money.  Buy enough deep, deep OTM options and you will spike IV.  IV spike triggers algo.  Algo triggers movement.  VIX has been investigated for manipulation in this fashion several times."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You keep mentioning losing on GME and blaming it on theta but the real issue is buying when IV is 800%. In layman‚Äôs terms, everyone is expecting a huge jump in GME so you‚Äôre going to pay for it, if it doesn‚Äôt happen you‚Äôre going to lose."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah I see now. Thank you for the brain wrinkle
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you have the balls to do a credit spread on calls on GME I salute you. It's honestly looking at options a good move. Especially if you can get comfy in the 600/700 range. The odds of price reaching that level next week are horrible based on currently held options. But this is GME we're talking about.

One way I've been toying with for avoiding the premium fuckery is doing limit sells/buys. So in a credit spread scenario I would limit buy the saftey BTO call as close as bid, then once i've secured that call I open a limit sell on the lower STO call to complete the credit spread. 

the bid-ask spread eats a time of the premium but negates 0 of the risk. Good luck to you!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,ok

Was boredom unknown to them? This is  indeed a question raised by a human, a busy ape. Far from fleeing  monotony, animals crave it, and what they most dread is to see it end.  For it ends, only to be replaced by fear, the cause of all activity.  Inaction is divine; yet it is against inaction that man has rebelled.  Man alone, in nature, is incapable of enduring monotony, man alone wants  something to happen at all costs ‚Äî something, anything.... Thereby he  shows himself unworthy of his ancestor: the need for novelty is the  characteristic of an alienated gorilla.‚Äù

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah man. Ape brethren will finally get enough donations to buy GME
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve been loving the gorilla support but this in particular is one of the greatest things I‚Äôve seen on this sub
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I fuckin roared
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Naked options out for Harambe.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"All the others are so polite, this one is raw."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I work in non profit, I‚Äôm laughing at knowing they are going to get solicitation and annual fund letter and email requests now for YEARS addressed to ‚ÄúFuck Melvin Capitol‚Äù"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking spot on. In control of literal trillions of dollars and doing nothing but hoarding it so they can short others' livelihoods into bankruptcy and avoid us plebs at all costs.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,One thing ive learned is the people who tip or donate the most can least afford it. Alot of wealthy people are cheap
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Meet the fuckers
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"We need to donate enough so that we can get a research center named the ""Fuck Melvin Capitol Ape Research Center"" or the ""Robinhood Sucks Ape Research Center"""
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Name of the guy who started the PAC checks out.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends on the website. One I did was $50 minimum. Maybe others have lower options. Obviously, you can donate more."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this turns a wholesome act into a juvenile crude jab. Just put GameStop or something. 

Edit: Seriously, can‚Äôt wrap my mind around not being vulgar while donating to gorillas is apparently an unpopular opinion."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,$60-$150. You pay by the pound.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Mine was $60. On top of that I offered to pay the transaction fee of about $1.99 as well.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Theres only so many gorillas.. obs youre not actually adopting them its just a donation
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The real squezze is about to happen. I‚Äôm going long on Gorillas. ü¶çüöÄüåö
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are endangered, so basically there's a very limited number of them to be adopted, but the money still goes around to help them all, or at least that's how this usually works."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's not many to ""adopt."" They accept multiple adoptions for each gorilla."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Multiple people can sponsor the same gorilla.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What are the chances they are editing the text on the same picture.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,10/1 gorilla split coming up
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"So this is where you draw the line? Not the *other* terms used around here? lol

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,There‚Äôs only like 1K of those gorillas in the world. You dint literally adopt one ape. You just donate money and they send you a pic of an ape and a thank you
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Read comments. This is literally covered in every single ape thread near the top
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Going to be a shit ton of fail to delivers..

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Love it
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,so keep buying? Got it!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but what are you gonna do with 100 apes, start your own sub?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This thread is so meta and I can‚Äôt stop laughing üòÇ
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,We're about to squooze!!!! EVERYONE KEEP DONATING!!!!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Definitely, but we are all for it. I can imaigne them shooting photos of the same ape but at different angles."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Gorillas getting passed around like GME borrowed shares
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Adoption in this context means you pay money for the gorillas upkeep.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, they could use it. The more money going to support each gorilla, the better."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I adopted the same one as well. Nothing like a good silverback
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,My wife's boyfriends ape

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, you‚Äôre saying they‚Äôre not actually gonna let me personally keep the gorilla?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder how much you would have to donate to have your own gorilla that nobody else can adopt
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"What an interesting crew of parents these gorillas will have then. Happy to see them outgrow their parents intellect already tho, so proud."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh shit, what did you get in at?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,GTFO HEDGIE!!!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Roared like a kitty would you say?

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I may die broke, but this is worth every penny."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, making (hoarding) money is literally a hedge fund's sole purpose, by design."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they do this there's now going to be a plaque of ""Hedge Funds eat my asshole."" lol"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Over $20k worth so far.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone with more IQ than me should work out how much that would be
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahaha of course
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,They have options?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty fucking tasteless imo. These people give their lives to caring for endangered animals, just to see that someone is only donating to be a jackass. The gorillas just got some more funding, so I guess it doesn't matter if people are only doing it for internet points."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Seriously ‚Äî they should exile degenerates like this onto their own subreddit or something. Fucking assholes.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats alot of bananas
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,time to short squeeze them

I'm thinking my gorillas will arrive sometime next week of the post office can get its act together."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're right! I fixed it, thank you"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Hedge? I adopted one of these Gorillas hours ago.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Apes are already on the moon.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It gives you the right but not the obligation to adopt a gorilla for $50 even once their minimum is $100.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The issue is that this is no longer a somewhat isolated sub. Like it or not there's a media spotlight on us and those cocksuckers will use anything they can to screw us over/shut us down. This donation wave is amazing, just leave it at that. I'm all for putting ""Gamestonk"" or whatever in the donation line, but don't cross the line into something negative."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,My eduacation is in environmental studies/fisheries and wildlife biology.  I think I do my part.  Vegans help that to with their diet.  Vegan politics can get in the way of helping animals though.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"if you would directly contribute to the death of a living animal and then eat said animal then you absolutely do not care about them

it‚Äôs odd (slightly sad) that they‚Äôre upset about palm oil & orangutans but are okay with other animals being slaughtered just so they can eat them. just a big inconsistency i guess"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"what do you consider your part to be? you‚Äôre educated in those fields - do you understand that animals are sentient and are capable of suffering? i don‚Äôt know how or why you consider the lives of orangutans to be more valuable than cows or chickens.

vegan politics have nothing to do with this. veganism is about helping animals. anything other than that is irrelevant and shouldn‚Äôt be grouped into the main aspects of veganism. the entire goal is to help and protect animals, nothing more and nothing less. i feel that people (misinformed vegans and vegetarians especially) have ruined the general public‚Äôs view/ idea of veganism & it‚Äôs goal. 

subreddits like r/vegan are absolutely awful. the concept of veganism has been watered down.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus you are annoying. Fact
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'll keep this short and simple as possible. Stuff I've done. Surveys for fisheries. What's there. Compare this to what was there.  If things are disappearing then that's an alarm that someone could be fucking up polluting things or there's a climate change effect. Or logging organisms in a places so people know in the future if they are disappearing then somethings fucked up. 

Where some of your views may or may not get in the way.  We have altered the ecosystem in crazy ways that need to be managed now.  Deer for example. Get too many and we have to cull them.  People try to stop  this.  We got rid of their predator so we are all that control them. Two things can happens at high enough populations.  The capacity of the environment can't handle it and there's  a mass starving of the poulation that may not recover for a long time.  In high concentrations disease can spread like wildfire again killing off a mass of the population.  Kill a little and save a lot or let them be and let them suffer and die.

As for if I value an Orangutan over a cow and chicken my answer is yes.  They are under no threat of extinction.  Preserving genetic and Species diversity is of the up most importance.  We are loosing species at speeds that rival other extinction events."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Beasts do not participate in society. To offer them the same level empathy you would another human imparts no benefit to you. It is only a detriment. That beast will likely not respect your rights unless you are larger than it. 


Its incredibly na√Øve and foolish. The dodo was never going to populate Mars. Humans can. You want to tie our hands behind our backs for a bunch of lowly beasts. You need to dial it back a bit."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"privilege? are you fucking joking lmfao

how does being a vegan & caring about animals = privilege? it‚Äôs funny how many people think that vegans are privileged because they don‚Äôt eat meat (i guess???) and have a consistent moral compass. you‚Äôre privileged. if this is about food & the price of food, veggies, beans, & rice are cheap. tofu isn‚Äôt even that expensive. but okay - vegans are privileged. fuck off dude. 

in comparison to starving kids or people with absolutely no other choice, vegans are privileged. but you know what? anyone who has access to water and a stable food supply is privileged. except those things shouldn‚Äôt be considered a privilege, because those things are a basic human need. 

but sit there and continue to call vegans privileged. try growing up and not being so self-centered. it‚Äôs pathetic honestly"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"i‚Äôd rather starve but:
saying ‚Äúcorpse‚Äù means that the lamb had already died. you did not kill the lamb just to eat it (unless you did, however your wording makes me think you didn‚Äôt). that‚Äôs the difference. natural causes are not the same as an animal being slaughtered for meat."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Neil deGrasse Tyson explained this, cows are basically biological weapons, they are no longer an animal that sustains or keeps balance in an ecosystem, they could be wiped out of existence and NOTHING would happen to the environment, the same could be said for chicken and fish (all of them are made in farms).

Crying out that animals have feelings and stuff is what has tried to humanize dogs and cats (which is psychologically incorrect for animals to be treated as humans) love your dog? Hell yes! Love your cat? Absolutely! But love a food-making machine modified by humans? Not really."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"so you think that doing surveys for fisheries and monitoring the environment is enough to balance the harm you do when you consume animal products? 

humans suck. that‚Äôs just it. i‚Äôm not trying to start an argument (which often happens because this is reddit and vegans are largely disliked) but it is disgusting that humans feel that they are entitled to murder animals for their sensory pleasure. human intervention is also a bit iffy. 

but again, why do you care about orangutans but not the hundreds of pigs crammed into tiny, filthy places? why do you care about diminishing fish populations but not the cows or chickens being slaughtered just for you to eat a meal? 

in a nutshell: if you are able to survive on an entirely plant-based diet and have access to resources and information, there is absolutely zero excuse. you do not need meat to survive. nutritional needs can be met without animal products. a plant-based diet is only expensive when you throw in mock meats. irrelevant to the conversation at hand, but i know at some point it‚Äôll be addressed.

vegans don‚Äôt hate starving children living in third world countries. it is a necessity for many to consume animal products, but it is also possible for the majority to pursue a vegan lifestyle.

it‚Äôs not enough for people to do baby-steps or to be vegetarians. animals are still harmed. veganism isn‚Äôt about being liked. vegans who don‚Äôt speak up (or vegans who support other people harming animals) only hurt the cause. it‚Äôs really telling that the only way to be a ‚Äúgood‚Äù vegan activist (hate that word) is to be quiet and to not (directly) challenge carnies or call them out on their ways.

2021-03-14 04:09:14,wallstreetbets,"How the United States government could benefit from meme stocks going to the moon # DISCLAIMER: NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVISE OR 100% BASED ON FACT(S). THIS IS SIMPLY EDUCATIONAL AND THEORETICAL DISCUSSION.

# TL;DR: Capital gains tax, easing and even erasing debt, financial stimulus to peoples all over the world, a happier and more compliant population, tax dodgers and those who screwed over the world in 2008 brought to justice in the only way that matters, and a much needed stock market correction that could prevent a future disaster.

We all know that many meme stocks theoretically have the potential to explode through short and gamma squeezes, and that will make many shareholders on the long side a lot of money.

However, when looking at the bigger picture, there is a lot that the government could gain from such events that can help them and the country in a long run.

Let's take a look at the aftermath of meme stocks mooning;

# 1.) Capital Gains Tax

When people sell their meme stock shares after short squeezes occur, governments will attain taxes off these investments. Considering that millions of shares will be traded frequently for large sums of money, that will bring some much needed stimulus to the economy.

This is especially considering how 40% of America's money has been printed in the last year due to COVID-19. Instead of raising taxes on the American people and having them pay more for their own money in the long run, the capital gains taxes from these stocks can potentially make that unnecessary.

Also, with more money gained from stocks, many will likely re-invest some (or even most) of their money back into the stock market; leading to even more capital gains taxes being reaped.

# 2.) People being more willing and able to spend, further stimulating the economy and creating a happier population

It's no surprise that when times are tougher economically, people tend to spend less and save more. Yet because this leads to governments reaping less taxes and businesses not being as profitable, this makes economic times rougher, which in turn...

Leads to a potentially endless economic recession/depression.

We've seen this in Japan in the late 1990's and early 2000's, and they are currently at economic levels that are equal to their status in 1980. They've gone backwards in terms of their financial progression.

With the general population in possession of large sums of money, however, this allows the economy to be stimulated; which not only benefits many people from nearly all classes, but also creates a happier population overall.

Imagine it; after a year of prolonged quarantine, job loss, future inflation and economic instability, all while billionaires and institutions are playing the system and becoming even more rich for their own sakes...

Suddenly get served justice...

Then their money gets divided among those who took the most risks and played against them, fought the fight to the end, and helped make the world a better place.

This is practically the script to Endgame; heck, most action/heroic movies. And the American people get to be a part of it.

Speaking of ""bad guys"";

# 3.) The gains also won't be in the hands of large tax dodgers

We all know that tax dodging is practiced by many, especially those in large positions of power and wealth. 

So is it truly wrong to reasonably assume that many big Wall Street players are dodging taxes?

For the U.S. government, this means that a lot of money that should and could be going towards erasing national debt, fortifying infrastructure, improving medical and educational institutions, and many more benefits for Americans overall is instead being kept away for the sake of keeping rich individual's bank accounts filled with zero's. 

With the money in the hands of the average citizen, however, the vast majority will not be able to commit tax fraud (if at all) on a massive level. 

Of course, they won't go out quietly when the squeezes happen, yet that can still be a good thing because;

# 4.) The stock market needs a correction

Many have been speculating that the stock market is not accurately reflecting the American economy, and that a correction is inevitable.

When the squeezes happen for meme stocks, however, after the new DTCC rule comes into effect, that will force hedge funds to liquidate much of their assets to cover their positions.

They'll likely sell their other shares in massive volumes; causing huge dips to occur in many stocks across the stock market.

Yet once the dust settles, people can finally reassess the market(s) and determine where everything should be.

Stocks that deserve to be higher will be on huge discounts for many investors to get in on and allow them to go back up again, while those that deserve to be down will likely stay down.

Then, the economy can become stabilized again, and everything can continue as it should.

# Whether all of this is correct or not is beyond me, and only based on the information I currently know. 

# There's far more that could and could not happen based on if/when meme stocks skyrocket and force many shorters and market makers to buy stocks at higher prices.

# But most importantly, I wanted to start a potential discussion on the aftermath of meme stocks going to the moon, and allow others to also and and correct my statements as well as share this info with the overall community.

# So what do you think?"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like the ""and responsible for"" part: ""Your trading is so bad we want to make sure you won't claim that your account got hacked.""

Did they bother sending it as registered mail?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Write them back. Tell them in an incoherent way that you are retarded and have no idea why they sent the letter and ask them what Fidelity means and who‚Äôs account they are talking about. Post their response. Should be fun. But ask an expert first on letter writing, which is not me. I‚Äôm a retarded moron. What‚Äôs a letter?  Where am I?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your caption made me laugh - the letter made me cry.

But you, fellow brother in retardation, made me proud."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn. Snail mail too. Guess they're classy and shit
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys are absolutely killing me with this insanity.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs the best lost porn I‚Äôve ever seen.  Basically a letter from an actual director literally telling you ‚Äúwe just wanted to make sure you knew you were really retarded and we don‚Äôt take any responsibility for your retardedness and if you need help we have some videos you can watch about not being so retarded.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you investing in Melvin capital? üòÇüòÇ

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I was down (not selling) about $100k-ish last week for a day or two. Bought that thicc dipp and 3 days later I smashed my ATH.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,First of many.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"HOLLY SHIT, OP, either your entire portfolio is incredibly huge to not give a fuck or you must be a professional retard"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"-$440k, my goodness, can we make a hall of fame sticky post and post stuff like these to make it eternal?

I saw -$30k, -$60k before. I think -$50k yesterday. But -$440k is a whole new level"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"On the bright side, it looks like there‚Äôre is plenty of room for improvement!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruh you must have millions to lose that much
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I couldn't do it man. I'd end up baker acted if I lost that much. I'm here for loss porn, but damn."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Omg this is so good cant be real, can it?"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why I could never go with Fidelity. Judgement is one thing I cannot abide.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Make sure to call and confirm its within your risk tolerance, even if it doesn't say to do so on the letter.  I got one of these 2 years ago, 30 days later one random morning they blocked my trading for 2 days until I called and confirmed."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow retard! Did you also adopt an ape or some other animal to solidify your status ?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeesh, what were the 72 trades?"

OP, good grief, update us every now and then so we know you are still alive.

(I hate this, but I have to be honest, I am, in fact, a Boomer. But I did fuck up my daughter's college education around 2001 to 2003, forgot exactly when, some risky Janus tech mutual fund NO fucking business being in. Felt.like.shit. And lost my job. And then the company closed, so I lost COBRA health insurance. and it keeps on going, lets just say, my wife's boyfriend can still have kids. Going by the definition of 1964, I always had a problem calling myself a Boomer when I could not get drafted to go to Vietnam - I like the Replacements words from Bastards of Young, ""Got no war to name us"" ).

Edit: My older brother is a Boomer, he went to college so was not drafted, we got into a disagreement over NFL kneeling, he brought up he lost a HS friend to Vietnam. This is what I mean. I suppose I (we?) could have lost a cousin though."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah i know, people losing a few grand is one thing. this guy lost enough money to sustainably live off the interest for the rest of his life.."

Well, OP,  now."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I've got .44 share that I bought when it was around $50 a share. I'm so damn proud of it anyways lmao.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahahhaa. There's a lot of rich people here. And a lot of broke people. And a lot of people in between.

This is a sub of almost 10 million subscribers. And I followed this sub (from my main account) since 2014 and I still didn't subscribe (nor did many of my friends who also followed this sub for years).

So the actual number might be far far more. Even multiples (simply cause it's embarrassing to sub this subreddit for many).

&#x200B;

There's a huge population here. One of my friend did a yolo play on tesla last year with 14 million dollars (never posted on WSB).

Trust me, lots of unfathomable money gets inputted from posts here. You just don't see it (cause many don't post publicly).

I lost $40k alone in the month. Still net positive. And I never posted my positions here :)

And then go to TeamBlind. There are developers making $300\~600k a year throwing money to many of the WSB bets. People keep talking about 'whales' and all. Truth is, this entire subreddit if dedicated is 1 huge whale. The only issue is everyone does separate plays.

Theoretically, if everyone here in this sub bought in average 4 shares of GME, GME would have skyrocketed long time ago. But GME still didn't. Still an amazing subreddit if you think about it. This subreddit has got to be the most disorganized large public hedge fund with no concept of risk tolerance out there."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"its social media, do you believe all your friends are always going on vacation and winning $1000 on a scratch off lottery ticket? Nope everyone is as miserable and broke as you, we just keep it to ourselves because you cant brag about being a broke retard in a room full of broke retarads."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Safe estimated interest is what 6% tops? Living off of 30 K year seems difficult. Living comfortably at least.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Youre joking right? You'd be living in poverty as defined by the US.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats only 3% interest though
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs $18k a year, which is less than a minimum wage job. Where tf can you live on that?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean most ETFs generally get 10-15% return per year could live off that pretty easily. But economics downturn could be a problem be at the whim of the market
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I actually thought of doing that lol
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"40,000 a year is a bit tight to live on if you have to keep in mind health care cost and insurance"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Dividends what is this monopoly?! *immediately researches dividends*
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"That would be $43,000 a year, we need to be guaranteed every year and I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs enough money"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,How‚Äôs the political situation there currently
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can live off $25,000 a year in Kentucky?! Are we assuming that there‚Äôs just no healthcare cost and your insurance is somehow already covered?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What industry do you work in?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"12% is a double the safe assumption though. Can you can guarantee 12% a year return, every year?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It has to be a guaranteed 7%... FORRRREVERRR. Also you might misunderstand what I‚Äôm saying. One 500,000 is such a life-changing large amount of money that a family can comfortably live off of it then why the fuck am I still working?!
And secondly so long as you live in a country that provides healthcare for you.

But honestly do you guys all think that $500,000 is that max cap and you can all retire. If it‚Äôs so easy for 500,000 is all you need to retire then who the hell still working in their 50s and 60s?! I‚Äôve got friends who have more than that in their 401(k) balance by age 32. So is the answer everybody moves to an Asian country and we just live there forever? Laos Cambodia Thailand where the dollar can go much further and we hope the healthcare officials enough to take care of us. What are the cost emigrate there? Obviously more expensive places like switch with and you need to have a shit ton of money to move there. Are we also presuming that we just rent the whole time or do We actually own property?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also 10% isn‚Äôt realistic unless apparently you‚Äôre fairly seasoned and investing especially to bump it to 20%. The point is we‚Äôre looking for that figure where you can retire with the money in the Bank and live solely on the safe guaranteed return of interest which is typically 4%. 

It would be cool if we were all Wolf of Wall Street types I could make bank but that‚Äôs not what this point is for. What is the amount one can have in the bank to live safely on the interest paying for all bills that one would need and healthcare. In my opinion and experience and for the lifestyle I particularly would want 500,000 is not nearly enough."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, not in a 1st world country mate. Go to Vietnam, you'll spend 1/4 less per year . Also, most low risk stocks are like 3-4% per year so that's enough money to make 500k last forever. If you look around up to 8% is possible. That's like 35-40k a year, definitely possible to live off."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruh you live like a king in Mexico. Same would go for Thailand.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,word. At 8% interest that's almost $40k a year. You're fucking set in Mexico or pretty much any place in Latin America.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Which wont be very long if certain locals find out you have that kind of money.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dayumm.. bond yields >10%. I'd say that's suspiciously great (E.g. I suppose that yield is being expressed in Ukrainian currency, which is undergoing said high inflation)."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,hmm. I wonder if there's a catch?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I liver super comfy spending less than 30k an year even though I make way more. It depends on what you want out of life. (Canada)
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"dude, we are talking about frugality here. and tbf, in my central European home country, you live really nicely on 30k, especially if you own your property. having to spend a shitload on healthcare and stuff in the US completely messes up the picture for you guys of what it actually takes to live in any other country that already provides (kinda) free healthcare and social amenities."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I make like 35-38k on a good year. I guess I don‚Äôt know what living comfortably means. üò≠
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,1.7 % maybe?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I currently live off of less than 10k a year as a student lol
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,4% is generally considered the safe number.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"> 30 K year

Where I live 10K a year before taxes is average, in other words really great. Minimum wage would be about 5k."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,the ones we blew up in WWI/WWII that havent really come back since
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You could easily live with 30k a year in Germany
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Really depends where. Switzerland won‚Äôt be the same price as Spain
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,30K in vietnam would go a loooong way. Not sure about healthcare though.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"take this for what it's worth but I knew a guy that spent a week in a hospital in Vietnam after getting sick and he was charged $35 total.

He didn't know if he got any kind of special deal or if it was normal, he just paid it and left in case it was a mistake"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed -- it's not comfortable retirement money, though if you're retirement age, it's supplementing social security payments.  Also helps a lot if you've got a paid-off house.  

Still, one could reasonably expect (not guaranteed) to double that in about a decade without putting any more money in if you're not living off it.  40k a year... ain't fancy living, but you could do it in a low COL area.  Another decade if you want a nicer retirement."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,There are plenty of tickers paying 8-15% right now. If you are willing to put forth the effort researching you can bounce your money around and collect quite a bit. Although I feel when you are up to half a million in your investing account there are probably far better way to use your money than chasing 3-5% dividends.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,All the same places other poors live off of minimum wage jobs... you don‚Äôt live like a king. You survive.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Your mum's basement
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,$18k a year is more than minimum wage.  Minimum wage is $15k a year.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,In most of rural Appalachia the median household income is about $14k.  It's not exactly a glamourous life but if you're into minimalism and nature it's pretty sweet.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends on what your expenses are and desired QoL.  If you own a house and can rely on public transportation, add what someone in your area would be paying for those expenses.  If average rent is $1,000 and car payment is $300, that $18K is now $34,000.  You're not living like a king, but you could be doing a lot worse."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You could do it.   Small piece of land.  Buy a used RV or camper.    Wouldn't be the most comfortable lifestyle but it's doable.   

You may not *want* to do it, but you could do it."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"ETFs don't generally get 10-15% a year.

Generally, 4% is considered the safe infinite drawdown when downturns are taken into account.

So $500k can be loosely thought of as $20k a year forever.

Old people who don't need forever can often increase their drawdown higher than that -- say like 7% when you're in you're 70s or whatever."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a hell of a lot of passive income compared to .5% that's normal and a decent start there are a fair number of people living off that or less every year.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,From what I‚Äôve seen I‚Äôd you stay near the touristy areas you‚Äôre plenty safe. I‚Äôve had a few military friends take their pensions there and basically live like kings.

Like how unhealthy are you people over there to assume health are costs are a driving factor in cost of living? Some people go to the doctor once a decade... how expensive Healthcare is here (which is actually cheaper because of the whole not giving it away for free to everybody and getting raped up the ass with taxes to pay for it) does not factor into col. Obligatory education on the fact that Americans military subsidizing Europe as a whole's military cost allows countries like Sweden or Norway to have universal Healthcare because they don't have to spend money on making sure they're not invaded. Pretty easy to pay for stuff when all your big bills are paid for by someone else.

edit: Rut roh I rustled some European skintight jimmies!! Here's another hard to swallow fact for you across the pond.... the US leads in medical research and innovation. You inbreds over there get to make use of our medical research after we paid the bill to discover it.

If your not doing 25% or much better per year the last 3 years your fucking up in a major way, frankly 25% gain is conservative anyone half paying attention should be up like 200-300% over the last 3 years."

even so, we're still spending more than Europeans are on individual services rendered, despite paying through the nose for a monthly premium."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The issue is that one health issue can wipe you out financially. And over a lifetime, at least one major health problem isn‚Äôt exactly uncommon.

Last I saw, people in the US paid more for healthcare (including taxation) than any other country:

Of course, I pay monthly premiums and all that... but in a country where healthcare is ‚Äúfree‚Äù, it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs paid by taxes. Goods and services (i.e. healthcare) aren‚Äôt free.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a good point.  5% over inflation is probably a more reasonable number, which would give you more like 16 years to double instead of 10 years."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough... Minimum wage is as high as $31k in some places.  $15k is federal minimum.

Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Tennessee have no minimum wage, though federal minimum wage still applies.  Georgia and Wyoming both have minimum wages lower than the federal minimum wage (just shy of $11k), which just means the federal minimum wage wins."

But again what does a healthcare plan cost you in these areas? Looking at the rates on the open market it‚Äôs not decently affordable. Also are we presuming we rent forever in these scenarios?

I think a decently small yet well designed off the grid house or cabin on a little bit of land would be ideal but again it all comes down to a country where I could go bankrupt even with healthcare if I got cancer, that‚Äôs less than ideal .."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Possibly, especially if you have a significant other also bringing that in. $4,000 a month - rent and utilities, groceries etc isnt bad. But a decent healthcare plan from the market will cost you."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,don't forget about footing the bill for all the medical research that other countries get to use after we paid the bill to discover the medicine

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Doable
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Course not but have to base an assumption off something. 15 year average and 5 year average is good enough assumption for me but of course you should always hedge. Personally do it with rental property.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs all we can ask ü§£
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Almost sounds too easy though right? Why isn‚Äôt everyone doing that then? I mean I hear you both my 401(k) and Roth IRA are in the mid to high 20% ROR over the past two years. But I think the overall intent of this very long chain I‚Äôve accidentally started it is can you park $500,000 in something a set it and forget it type in generate enough interest to live comfortably on. I agree with you 12% is $60,000 and that would handle most things nicely in a large slew of countries.

I‚Äôve heard many Americans say their figures $6 million. With $6 million they can take 1 million by the hectares they want, get a decent property, cars furnishings etc. then live worry free at 4% interest on $5 million- $200k a year.

To me if you already have your property set up then realistically you would only need about $50,000 a year to cover all your usual expenses and bills and to allow yourself a good degree of freedom and travel.
Provided of course you have healthcare, and can‚Äôt go bankrupt like you could in America from some catastrophic illness."

also, it was never a penalty for being too poor for health insurance - I went several years without insurance and didn't catch penalties. iirc, if market rate insurance was more than 10% of your yearly income, they didn't give a fuck."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It still exists it's just been set to $0. If Biden wants he can set it back to Obama era levels.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,So with fidelity the margin requirements for gme is 100% and they don‚Äôt lend out shares unless you have a level 4 options account.  My account is level 2 and I confirmed that my shares aren‚Äôt being lent out
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"yea when i bought these it was back in december/january when the price was around 18-22 a share.  I could have bought 400 shares at the time, but when it was at 110 last week when I sold it let me buy 1400 shares.  seemed like a good time to sell them and load up so I did"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"How many calls? I can do the math quickly.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, at least you can write. Lots of apes out there can't do either"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You can buy calls and then sell them later for more money if the stock price has increased since then.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,when i bought these calls they were not covered
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look on the bright side, the loss porn on that would be unreal"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,30x 3/19 150c @30.25

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,yup i bought these calls when gme was around 18-22 per share
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you have a free trial link somewhere
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh i already subscribe to you, little peckers are sort of what I‚Äôm into"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's not how it works, someone else bought the calls from me and the option to exercise them still exists, it's just someone else's choice.  I didn't have the capital to buy the 2000 shares my options afforded me so I sold them to buy shares with the cash profit"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,yea fidelity's view takes some getting used to but ive been using them for like 5 years now and really like their service.  plus you can call them and talk to actual professionals and ask them questions
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks!  Here‚Äôs hoping this week is a good one!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hopefully you also bought the stock?? Almost ALL the analysts back then were saying GME is a SELL , and what happend since.

I don‚Äôt believe anyone of them anymore,"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"But that is exactly how it works. If you don‚Äôt sell existing contracts, new ones have to be written, and they require someone to buy 100 shares per contract. Net, I would think this would probably have a negative effect on any squeeze effort.

Full disclosure: I‚Äôm not a GME bag holder."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"pics 1 and 2 show what price i bought at and how many shares, i bought early on but not as early as when i bought the calls"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Full disclosure: there are no gme bag holders lol

And my contract still exists, someone else owns it.  No new contract needed to be written when I sold mine"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, sorry , too tired, Head not functioning very Well , 02:27 at night in Europe"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, no new contract needed when someone bought BECAUSE you sold yours."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"2020:
‚ÄúWorst year of my life.‚Äù

2021:
‚ÄúI bought a gorilla.‚Äù"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Hi WSB ... I‚Äôm ONE of your clearly many resident registered primatologists(!!!!) and this recent group endeavor has me aflood with happy tears. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for what you‚Äôre doing for our actual ass cousins. üíú
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ppl probably won't see this comment, but for all you retards that are donating to this charity check to see if your company will match. We adopt a gorilla every year and between my company and my wife's company we 3x our initial donation."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a PhD primatologist, this is the best thing ever. I cannot express how amazing this sub is. I‚Äôm so proud to be a part of it."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This, ladies and gentlemen, is how you make a one-off meme into a full-blown regular occurrence.

Now every time someone hits a moonshot it‚Äôll be customary to adopt another gorilla.

Dian, you‚Äôre going to run out of gorillas to adopt out pretty quickly. When you do, just open up each gorilla photo in photoshop, flip horizontal, then save it as a new name. This‚Äôll double the number of gorillas to adopt out, nobody here will notice."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"With WSB piling in, there will be more adoptions than gorrillas outstanding, leading to synthetic gorrillas, and failures-to-deliver... gorillas."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's the difference between rich people and common folk. We understand the importance of having money and what it feels to not have it. Because we don't have a ton of money we appreciate what money can do and how it can make others feel good so when we get money we spend it on others.

I had an electrician over a month ago, and I didn't have enough cash on hand to pay him, so he said just venmo it. So we got to talking about if he ever had anyone stiff him on the bill, he said almost never because people are decent."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"so, let‚Äôs get this straight. a website about nothing that has a sub-site dedicated to gambling on stock insurance in which a cult following of purchasing used-game-broker company stock resulted in wall street hedge funds losing billions of dollars and was subsequently investigated by the United States Gov‚Äôt with a testimonial from a gentleman known as DeepFuckingValue has resulted in the monetary donations for the preservation of gorillas.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"this message made me adopt the father/son combo from their website.

""Twibuke, meaning remember, was born into Shinda‚Äôs group in June of 1998. He is the son of the legendary silverback Shinda. In 2015, Twimbuke, who was just 17, succeeded in keeping together the group after a series of dramatic events. In 2017, just two short years after taking over the dominant role in the group, Twibuke fathered a son named Iyamarere, meaning enthusiast, with mother Tegereza. Iyamarere is now 3 years old and is beginning the weaning process. He will soon gain the confidence to be independent from his mother. 
  
Fathers play a special role in the lives of their infants.  They are steady and reassuring in the protection of the infants and the group, but they require on-going protection and monitoring in order to ensure their survival. 
Proceeds from adoptions support our daily gorilla protection efforts in the field in both Rwanda and nearby Democratic Republic of Congo. 

as a single father with sole custody, this hit home.  and my son's not much older than his new ape brother

just waiting on the adoption package now :)"

Sold half my $GME shares on Friday because it was 100% of my account, and I got terrified, but gonna Hodl the other Half till the Squeeze has been Sqouzed!

>  
>As expected, it was  expensive to do this. We can't all go see them, even if we had the money  - adoption is the next best thing.The gorillas are tracked & their  area patroled 24/7. They need it. Preserving them is also preserving  their habitat - all this costs more than 300 donations. There are only that few of them left.  
>  
>The more apes behind them - the better. It takes 2 apes to make an ape but ALL apes to raise that ape. Let's raise some apes. :)

I just posted that on another thread but is appropriate here. After I left that forest, I seriously doubted they'd make it a decade - it's been 2.  Only 300 of them vs the world. The odds seemed stacked too high against them. That is how fragile everything was out there. 

Donate if you can, but seriously us just talking about it is raising awareness amongst ourselves if anything."

**Thank you, you** ***Degenerate Ape*** **for adopting a gorilla!**

Symbolic adoption is a meaningful way to get involved in the conservation of the planet‚Äôs last wild gorillas and to improve the lives of communities who live near them.¬†

You¬†will receive an¬†adoption certificate via email within the next 24-hours along with a detailed profile of your new gorilla, including exclusive information from our expert field staff, and a special video of your gorilla from the field!‚ÄãYou¬†will also receive a digital subscription to the Gorilla Journal, the Fossey Fund‚Äôs quarterly newsletter featuring colorful images of the gorillas and other wildlife, programmatic updates, and stories from the field.¬†

Proceeds from adoptions directly support wild gorilla protection in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. As the world‚Äôs longest-running gorilla conservation program, The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund knows that conservation does not happen in isolation. It only happens when individuals join with organizations to protect and save vulnerable species so that we can all thrive together.

We know that people around the world are currently facing unprecedented challenges, and your support means more to us now than ever. During this uncertain time, there is one thing you can be certain of ‚Äî the Fossey Fund is continuing our daily work to ensure the protection of gorillas and their habitats. \*\*In our 52 plus years we have never left the gorillas, and we do not intend to start now!\*\*‚ÄãYour gift to the Fossey Fund sustains our critical work at a time when the need to conserve gorillas and their habitats in Africa is more important than ever.

**Every gift saves a gorilla and changes a life - thank you for caring and thank you for giving.**

Sincerely,

Tara StoinskiPresident & CEO/Chief Scientific Officer"

Imagine if 10% of this sub donates $1 to saving an endangered species in the next two weeks. According to the updates donations are at approximately $100,000 (roughly $1 donated by 1% of the entire sub).
I think the energy and the momentum is great, just imagine what 10% of 9.5 million retards donating a $1 can do. That‚Äôs a catalyst"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Hedge funds don't want this to happen.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I could find a good stock to invest in to do meta superhero shit like this. Most of the groups ive been in are just straight up chatter ://

Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund is refusing any further shipments of chicken tendies because for the 10000th time gorillas don't fucking eat tendies.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Picture this: GME hits $100k. Everyone on wsb is now high millionaires/billionaires. *Billions* get poured into ape conservation funds. Apes are saved from the brink of extinction. Within a five decades, apes now number in the *billions*. All apes are thriving. 

Generations pass. One day a space shuttle crash lands on the earth and two astronauts from the late 20th century emerge from the wreckage. You know the rest."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"How did this whole gorilla fund thing get started?  

In any case it sounds like a nice charity."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Full circle. Rich banksters and oligarchs who rigged the financial and political system, own the media, tout their philanthropist ideals while contributing only for tax breaks that cost society more than the charity received, get PISSED when the rigged system somehow is used against them and throw the entire monopoly board against the wall to start over. The very people that contribute the most to the destruction of habitats and make it necessary for groups like this who must work on tight rope budgets to save what they can from corporate land grabs and warlord strategies. So while trillions of dollars in socialist programs were being paid to these same corporations that are destroying the planet, billionaires profiting from it go on the news to speak of the WSB marker manipulators trying to crash the market and steal all their ‚Äúhard earned money.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe fair share argument is bullshit,‚Äù said the despicable windbag. My point is, every time I‚Äôm browsing WSBs I see the stories of what should make us all proud. Donating Nintendo‚Äôs to children‚Äôs hospitals, helping people pay for a loved ones funerals, offers and condolences for all matters of affairs, and donation after donation to all sorts of great programs. The sheer irony that the ‚Äúphilanthropists‚Äù worth billions cant pay their share in taxes, throw a few pennies around in comparison to their gold piles, then want to talk about Apes as the criminals and lazy unemployment fraudsters. I‚Äôd rather be an ape than a billionaire bag of shit."

THIS is what good people do when they come into excess $$$$. This GameStop play has allowed everyday people to shift a little bit of the massive wealth that has been HOARDED by Billionaires- wealth that has NOT been accumulated by them from adding value to the world but by sequestering $$$ from people, from govt, by playing the market and taking more for themselves than they deserve. The wealth of billionaires comes at the expense of human health/wellbeing and environmental health. As they get richer the planet gets sicker and you know what happens when people who have a shred of conscious and good hearts get a scoop of that money? -they put some of it back to HELPING the land - rather than the rich who would delight in seeing that last remnants of health and diversity on earth being converted into more digits in their bloated bank accounts. Reallocate the stolen wealth/health of he world back into forests, land, community, diversity, healthy oceans and balanced ecosystems. ..... there are those that would covert it all to $$$ yet here we are converting $$$ back into planetary health.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here you guys. In case you want to go visit your cousins in Africa. 

Sierra Nevada clubs version: https://content.sierraclub.org/outings/gorillas-chimpanzees-more-uganda-rwanda

Or a trip report I found from a points enthusiast who did it without a tour group

trip report:
https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/ekbot1/trip_reports_and_churning_success_stories_weekly/fdcn7cy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 not sure
¬∑  A quick summary of what this is: mountain gorillas are endangered (but recovering!) and are only found in the mountains at the confluence of Uganda, Rwanda, and DRC. Tourists can buy a permit in any of these countries to trek through the forest in a small group (8 tourists + a few rangers) and spend an hour in close quarters with a gorilla family.

¬∑ Permits are $1500 per person in Rwanda, $600 in Uganda, and $400 in DRC. They are quite limited in number, so it's best to secure one ASAP. You have to do this through a company that's on the ground as it's not really feasible to do on your own from a foreign country. We chose to do our gorilla trek in Uganda because we didn't want to deal with instability and Ebola in DRC and didn't see any benefit to spending $900 more per person in Rwanda.

¬∑ You can do the trek in one of two national parks in Uganda: Bwindi or Mgahinga. Bwindi issues 96 permits a day; Mgahinga issues only 8. We booked early enough to be able to do our trek in Mgahinga. It's supposedly an easier trek than in Bwindi since the park is much smaller.

Looks
Amazing"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is ape-azing!  Serious note.  Tax-deductions. 

Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund is a 501(c)3 Charitable Organization: https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/521118866

What this means for Apes with Tendies is that your donations are tax deductible!  If you make $10,000 in stonks, Uncle Sam will want their taxes on that income.  Depending on your income, up to 37% to Uncle Sam plus you‚Äôre state wants a cut too!

Tax deduction is nice for us apes because let‚Äôs say ape helps apes with $1000 donation to gorilla fund.  That $1000 donation is deducted from the $10,000 income you made from stonks.  Meaning, Uncle Sam taxes ape only on the other $9000 you made.  

Apes new to Tendies and taxes should talk to an ape good at counting.  Preferably a tax professional ape.  The good things apes do with Tendies can save ape a lot of money at tax time."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Eh?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Plenty of people on the sub have donated some of their GME gains to children's hospitals and other human charities. Today is just ape day.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Weak
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Judging by the top comments, looks pretty wholesome to me"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Replacing snakes with apes son of a bitch i'm in.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"In all honesty, humans would be a tenth as parasitic as they are now if we could get away from this wealth hoarding system we have seen. People literally miles away from me dying of hunger while other ppl miles away from me forever sitting in an ivory tower enjoying lavish lifestyles without giving ANYTHING back and only figuring out ways to take more (in Chicago, USA for reference)."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Isn't that the greatest part of all this.  This stock was under $4 early August 2020.  6 months later it rose to over 120 times that value.  Currently it's over 66 times early August value.  Sure, it went down to under 10 times that value but here we are today.

Something is happening.  My brain is too smooth to know what the future holds but we all have confidence to hodl.  I have 100 shares and if I cashed out today I'd make over 10k profit.  I'm not scared though.  It's fucked up how much I believe (in what I don't know) but I've never really felt this way --- it's positive and has made this winter so much better.  You know what I thought when GME rebounded from the $170 dip this past week?  Maybe I should buy more.  So I did buy more at $248.

If it goes to zero on Monday then lesson learned and I'll walk away hoping I made a difference.  The difference being is millions of people knowing that the stock market is 100% against them.  On the other end, maybe it'll skyrocket and be life changing.  Or it'll just flatten out and I still hopefully make a profit."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Someone needs to hold a share for the gorillas, or we need to collectively work together to get the equivalent of a share donated. I am not an Environmental advisor I just like the species"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some said $125 but I saw someone else receipt for $69.99, maybe the $125 was the mother daughter one. Either way, I‚Äôve lost 5k on GME and am now only diamond handing 2 shares, but I‚Äôll gladly donate for the cause"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's actually a unique opportunity given by the people who save the gorillas, through years of study and hard work, along with building a charity that actually spends the money on saving gorillas (Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund has an A rating on charity review sites). We could live in a world where this doesn't exist, and where money can't actually save gorillas. Instead, anyone can choose to have an impact. That's a very good thing if people recognize it!"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The most tangible benefactor to ecological conservation is 100% hunters. The proceeds of licenses and tags fund over 90% of state level eco management and preserve both hunted and protected species and more importantly, their habitat. States use our tag money to buy tracts of land and set them aside for conservation, limiting all activities in the area that adversely effect the ecosystem. It's the same in Africa with big game hunts and green tag hunts where the animal is tranquilized rather than killed. Those hunts fund the vast majority of the conservation efforts.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Most of the time when they have those fundraiser more money goes into the expensive banquet than the actual funds. This really made my Saturday
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are some of The Good Rich that actually ask to get taxed more. The problem is that if The Evil Rich do not get taxed, then an imbalance happens and The Good Rich lose out. So they're not saying ""we volunteer! take our money!"", they're saying ""take our money but only if it hits Good Rich and Evil Rich alike!""

Like, imagine you're running a grocery store and you want to switch from 2 cents plastic bags to 20 cents paper bags because you worry about the bees and the penguins and shit. All other things equal, if your competition doesn't switch, then your ecological initiative will drive you out of business, since you're making 18 cents less per sale, ten thousand sales per day puts you down 1800$ a day. 

However, if legislation is put in that *all* stores have to offer an ecological option, this will not happen. Sometimes you have to legislate some good into this world *by force* and say if you want to run a grocery store, you will use 20 cents paper bags, or use your 2 cents plastic bags and pay 18 cents of carbon tax - you might as well switch to paper.

Now enough getting political, this is a fucking casino after all. I'm here to put my money in the shredder, glue the proceeds together, bend over for Uncle Sam like a good catholic choir boy, and spend the remains on bananas."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe you can help organize an ‚ÄúApes Together, Strong‚Äù shirt to be sold through the web sight."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Easy. 

""WSB is an online financial community whose members recently made a lot of money in the stock market. They have a self-deprecating sense of humor and refer to themselves as 'dumb apes.' In honor of that joke, they donated some of that recently gained money to you guys. You'll likely see a lot more of where that came from if you give a callout to their rallying cry 'apes together strong.'"" 

You don't have to tell her it's not a joke and that we're all just legitimately retarded."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Translating WSB to IRL is a challenge. Like when my dad asks me to explain how i got interested buying GME stock. Shouting ""TO THE MOON"" and ""APES STRING TOGETHER"" did not inspire confidence or understanding"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think $20k is only from donations under the name ""gamestop"" I am sure many others donated under their name or different aliases"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,We couldn't be more different. Wall Street is fundamentally psychopathic and here we are saving gorillas.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,That's cause the media is owned by the rich
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I do that with the bat place in Texas. I love their little print outs that they send about the bats with a glossy pic.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Because stuff like this isn‚Äôt actually you directly going to the animal. It‚Äôs purely ceremonial and essentially ups the attachment for donations. It‚Äôs just donating to the foundation in a fun way.

2021-03-14 03:01:34,wallstreetbets,"OIL Prices to the MOON!!!! $RIG Historical:

Oil prices have rallied over 100% from last year, after the kremlin and Saudi Arabia got into a disagreement last years OPEC meeting, which resulted in a 30% decline in oil over the weekend. The major issue was over the depth and extend of the oil cuts. Russia didnt believe in cutting oil, as they kept losing market share to American Oil companies. Saudi Arabia wanted to keep the prices propped up and extend the oil production cut agreement.

&#x200B;

This resulted in oil prices dropping to negative prices with added stress of covid 19. However, the biggest challenge to high oil prices was President Donald J. Trump. Prior to Covid 19, oil prices recovered from the 2014 oil crash in which oil prices fell to $20 a barrel. Oil prices reached prices as high as $80 per barrel. However, every time oil prices passed $70 a barrel he would tweet about the high prices, or give Saudi Arabia a call. However, Donnie T is gone, and we have a President Biden running the show. It is clear, from the past month, that president Biden is not willing to interfere and calm the market.

&#x200B;

Prediction:

As a result of the economy opening back up, vaccine distribution coming along, higher airline numbers,  Donald Trump is gone, and general compliance by the  Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries I expect the oil prices to move past 80 dollars in the coming months.

&#x200B;

Play:

I will play this environment by buying oil offshore drillers. My target company is $RIG. Rig has trippled in price since the start of the pandemic. While it does have 8 billion in debt, I think it could easily refinance this. Offshore drillers get paid per day by oil exploration companies to extract oil. This is called the day rate. At the low of the oil crash offshore drillers such as RIG were getting paid 150k, but that rate has reached a high of 350k. This will continue to increase as oil increases. Exploration companies have drastically reduced their operating investments. As the economy opens up, the exploration companies are going to be caught off their foot and will not be able to keep up with the oil demand.

&#x200B;

$RIG is one of the few strong remaining offshore explorers that has survived the oil downturn. I like the stock and expect it to reach a high of $13 from its current price of $4.50. It has a market cap of 2 billion, 8 billion in debt, and around 8 billion in offshore contracts.  It has a book value of $18, while its price hovers at $4.5. A .5 or even 1 price to book value ratio indicates 100% - 400% upside.

&#x200B;

Position Disclaimer:

20 position in

Strike Price 7

Expiration 08/20/2021"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,If you want to invest in oil. Go for companies who drill in the Permian basin. If prices go up. They start drilling there. My wifes family is in the energy business. Like 9 figure net worth type shit.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is an interesting call (note: I actually do own calls on RIG).

My logic in getting in was simple, Biden can and will block additional production in federal lands.  I don‚Äôt think he is going to block a few more wells coming online from offshore especially if they had held off during the pandemic on already approved contracts."

It has long potential.  Every President since the 60s has talked about cleaning up the environment and moving to renewables.  So far Action 0 Talk 124.  Developing countries give zero shits about the environment.  US and Euro markets might slow but that's going to be years.

Also kinda thinking that if gas guzzlers become a thing of the past they become cheaper because fewer gas stations.  So cheaper to own for us poors.  The wealthy and those willing to bleed out on long interest payments will get the new stuff."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is music to my ears. Rig to the moon.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like GUSH I'd the play for oil.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,That's all the DD I need OP.  Thank you!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also worth looking at Technip FMC. They recently finalised a spin off into two independent companies. TechnipFMC being subsea and surface upstream focused and Technip energies being downstream focused. This is great news because both sides now can focus on what matters and improve their books. Company was trading at 24-30 dollars before covid and dropped to 8 dollars now. They have 21B dollars worth of backlog in projects, and strong growth.

Traditionally its price was driven by oil&gas, which is expected to rise until June (I think that's when next OPEC meeting is, April one for cancelled) 

I went for subsea element, because it's not only oil and gas play, but also offshore wind and hydrogen. They are industry leader. Another interesting thing is that their revenue is now higher than market cap, which judging historically will typically correct itself by increased stock prices. 

Current price: around 8$
Realistic target: 10-11$
Moon target: 15$

I am at 300 shares <8$, TechnipFMC subsea"

Not financial advice."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,People forget that asphalt (roads) is a petroleum product. Hur Dur oil is dead we got electric vehicles xdddd.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,If Trump was president I would agree with you.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Market is forward looking, most of the gains in oil and recovery plays have already been made."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,He is more likely to allow prices to rise to strengthen his position against fossil fuels. Hard to get anyone to drop oil when it‚Äôs dirt cheap.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The world is still incredibly incredibly reliant on oil especially the world recovering from Covid and people start driving and flying again
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You still believe politicians?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Plastics are made from natural gas. Many common goods are derived from waste products of oil. Eliminate all cars and now you have gasoline as a waste product you have to dispose of to get your makeup and asphalt.

Windmills are made of epoxy or resin made from oil. Yup."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes...and then his admin awarded the $6 billion post office vehicle contract to Oshkosh (internal combustion engines) rather than to Workhorse (all EV, iirc). Funny, that."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"there are still many industries that will be using oil for many things anyway. For example we haven't commercialized the use of electric planes yet, so the airline industry is obviously still going to be using heavy quantities of oil."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea wake me up when the first solar powered train comes out
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,">but just one trade like this can make up for a large number of pathetic trades.

that actually has been my Investing strategy so far, and it works"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Wives? You have multiple? What's your secret
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've got a handful of 1.21.22. They're already double what I paid, should have bought them all."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, maybe 70-75 but let‚Äôs not get carried away"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,But with oil company plays you would need to factor in price of oil and demand so if you think Oil is going to hit 100 oil company stocks will rocket. So wouldn‚Äôt that mean that the main oil moves are yet to come?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Plus it hurts red state f250 drivers and give a confidence boost to blue state Prius drivers. Win win win for buyden . I‚Äôm long xle, xom and gush. Gonna throw some at rig as well"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are definitely those in Biden's circle who want $5/gal gas, and the most influential wing of the Dem party these days seems to be coastal elites who won't feel much pain from high energy prices.  But the swing states are full of working class people, many of whom buy gas guzzlers, who will feel the pain.  If gas goes to $5 then this will become a political issue.  It is an issue the voters will be reminded of every few days when they fill up their tanks.  The politicking for mid-term elections will be starting as this hits, so there may be some moves to give relief to the people.  Luckily for investors, any sort of relief takes time."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,XLE is almost back to it‚Äôs pre pandemic high I don‚Äôt see a lot of growth. Look into UCO
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is exactly what my confirmation bias needed. I might jump even deeper into SU on Monday
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the idea my guy. Might buy some leaps and hold to 8
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,meant 7 .
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is why i picked RIG, because this one is still really behind the curve"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"When gasoline cars disappear than gasoline becomes a waste product of oil refining that has to be disposed of. You solved nothing since your windmills require materials that come from oil. 

All you have done is took the problem and moved it somewhere else."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,There‚Äôs also a shitload of other products made from the products of refining oil
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It doesn‚Äôt need to provide 100%, it just needs to satisfy the industries it‚Äôs best suited for. People commuting 40-100 miles is perfect for electricity being the energy source. Even Semis will find use cases for electric. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve reached peak oil based on demand yet, but it‚Äôs coming. If we see a 10% drop in demand, that‚Äôs going to have a significant impact on oil companies."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This, and I will believe it when I see it. US has been sucking Saudi tit forever. A lot of hard relationships to get out of."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs unfair to say his administration, given the award choice was made by someone the previous administration installed and the current administration has no direct option to remove."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Fixed it. Obviously a typo.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,How about erx?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Buyden has already cancelled keystone and banned lots of drilling projects. Only relief would be to pressure the saudis to produce more which I think will be happening. But the fed can‚Äôt print more oil.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or ship the cars, or make plastic, or make renewable energy resource (fan blades and solar panels), oil is such a valuable resource it‚Äôs amazing the only thing people think of is hurrrrr cars."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I think gas is worse for the environment once it combusts, right?  Not combusting it seems like a net positive."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Of course the Biden administration could remove him. It's called 'asking for their resignation' and it happens all the time. There are even formal processes going through various committees if they REALLY wanted him gone.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt know that one but generally speaking xle and xom will perform equally (xle holds tons of xom) and gush is more variable. Same will be the case for rig. Rig needs high oil prices to be viable
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is WallStreetBets. Someone should add ‚Äúlong term‚Äù to the automod‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis is a casino!‚Äù response.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,That's so fucking stupid.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,They will have to burn it off to avoid storing a giant bomb.  That‚Äôs what they did when it was a biproduct before gas powered cars

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"For my daughter's 13th birthday she wanted to adopt an orangutan after watching some Nat Geo programs and watching the deforestation affecting them.  It took her and my wife a few days to decide on the same soul you adopted - Popi!  My  daughter was super excited to see continued support for her.

Apes (and primates) strong together!"

Look at the fonts, come on dude

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao literally just a screenshot of u/st3rlinarch3r‚Äôs post. Good effort.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Or if this guy just decided to copy paste some else‚Äôs
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah dude probably copied for karma. Sad shit
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,No they only have so many. Multiple people are getting the same one. You think they can do all those things for $125
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. I have adopted Popi three times. As a Christmas gift for my niece and as a birthday presents for my nephews. This way they all follow her progress together.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Op is a brand new acct, my guess is he is just reposting/karma farming"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, that just goes to show you how dead inside üåàüêª are. 

 Don't even take care of their own. 
 ( Probs just can't afford it )"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Look my profile dude I posted my confirmation email lots of people are adopting Popi also mine says GameStop as the name
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Multiple people can fund the same Ape FYI
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Obviously has caught on.... we both adopted the exact  same ape. So.... every other weekend?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just checked out the site. Considering it. Plus, I am a monkey and it's my Chinese animal."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah if you‚Äôd donate for your own shit it would
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,And you just happened to copy/paste someone else‚Äôs. üëç
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"he said they let multiple people adopt the same ape

I looked on https://fosseyfund.salsalabs.org/adopthomepage/index.html and some of the ones adopted are still available so I guess it checks out

also this guy posted proof: https://www.reddit.com/user/Tiny_Watercress8683/comments/m4kch6/confirmation_email/"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Or if they‚Äôd verify it since he‚Äôs just copy pasting
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, $125 is probably like 2 weeks worth of food for one gorilla"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,And that guess is 100% correct.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I call bullshit
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok nice, i trust u ape"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm all for altruism, I‚Äôm all against people using WSB to further their own shit like this guy"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Would you like to explain why homeboy deleted his own comment about it above? Dude is just karma-farming; using this sub.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah split custody sounds good to me
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You want my dookie?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"how about instead of accusing him of being a cheap fuck and copying and pasting it (which he didnt), you adopt another one and put your reddit username on the certificate instead of this negativity?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh my bad. Shoulda checked, thanks for clearing my bs up. So those two dudes are like a gay couple adopting. That's wholesome"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Chill I'm not I'll happily prove it
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why you got such a hard on for trying to piss on a good thing?

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Or two days worth of cocaine and hookers.   Depending how fucking cool the Gorilla is.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk why but hopefully people do this because they love apes and want to share the love of this community and not fake it for some cheap karma.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Banana split custody
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think that's called, ""putting money where your fat mouth is"".

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"He‚Äôs an ape, so he probably YOLO‚Äôd all his $125 donations in to GME shares."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Good point.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,125? for coke and hookers? where do i find these hookers and coke.... asking for a friend....

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah? I haven‚Äôt seen any other comment about your proof. Mind showing it?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Otherwise I, again, call 100% bullshit."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Orangutans have always been my fave animal thanks for the inspo for donating to orangutans your post inspired me check my profile btw if you want proof I didn't just screenshot yours

Edit: especially when you actually put your money where your mouth is, unlike this fuck."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,There seems to be a confusion they only one person can donate to a single beautiful Ape. I am just happy this community loves helping. I believe everyone posting is doing so with good intentions. I'm happy to see people here spreading the love and am thankful it's brought so much love.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Excited ape noises

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,People need to start tweeting about this and tweeting ryan cohen. Ryan Cohen should turn this into a marketing thing and have GME match a donation.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Out of all the pictures, you have the best looking ape. I think"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way!

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm fine with shared custody if you are.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,how do you get it to send you this acknowledgement?  I donated in memory of Jim Cramer's flaccid weiner but i just got a receipt.  I'll gladly adopt again to see the proper credit go to Cramer's acorn dick
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,And elephants
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"They released a thank you video. This came as a complete surprise and they can‚Äôt even believe it

This is so awesome"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think there has been about $20k donations from WSB so far. They received $2.2MM in 2019 from individuals alone (close to $6MM overall). So at the moment, it‚Äôs just a drop in the bucket. Still amazing."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you can adopt pandas, tigers, etc. :)"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Until he goes to the moon.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Multiple people ""adopt"" the same monkeys. I'm using air quotes because really it's just a donation but this makes people feel a lot more engaged. It costs between 60-150 dollars and there's no way that could protect a gorilla for the entirety of their lifetime. The organisation puts in a ton of effort to monitor and protect these gorillas. Literally people going into the forest each day to monitor the gorillas and protect them from poachers. There's only about 6-7 options for adoptions"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro it‚Äôs symbolic, there‚Äôs only so many. I adopted the same cute little guy."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Multiple people can support one ape. It takes a village
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre all genuinely retarded and have no life experience lol. You actually think you own the gorilla after paying $60?

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys have villages?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay, that‚Äôs semi realistic. This is like the 5-6 post about Urungano. Why adopt the same monkey? Do they just have the one?"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's only a handful of apes they are specifically looking after at the moment I guess. When a donation is made, it's not to support a specific ape, rather more the cause in general. By allowing someone to ""adopt"" an ape, it makes the people feel more connected to the cause, rather than just saying ""thanks for donating to the foundation."""
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, when all is said and done I‚Äôm going to adopt a gorilla because I like the stock and support the cause (I‚Äôm also gonna dress him up in Gucci, so other apes know what‚Äôs up) but there‚Äôs a lot of animals on here I‚Äôd like to support, #1 however is honey bees, may even start my own hive"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This has nothing to do with WSB or GME. It's a joke trying to play on emotions to get people to sell.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You're getting wiser ape. But the floor is rising every single day. The advanced apes need to help out the others and make them stronger.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's wonderful. But if he bought a better call than the one he did, then his money would've had the effect of buying ~1200 more shares at current price. MMs need to buy shares to hedge. Instead, he bought 800 FDs and his calls had the effect of buying ~200 shares.

I'm also saying that those calls are so retarded that literally just buying more shares like a pussy would've caused more bang for his buck. Those $800 calls do nothing but feed the hedge funds that he's playing against, giving them more ammo to short. That's my point."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I think he meant if he only bought shares it wouldn‚Äôt have as much impact as buying shares and options.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm on mobile and way too lazy to get up to get screenshots, but I'm listed in diamondhands . io (I guess my comment gets fucking deleted if I post that link? wtf is that about?) where you need to provide proof.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you're entirely missing his point. $800c is a virtually useless investment compared to just buying shares. Nobody is arguing that it's his money and his to do with whatever the fuck he wants, but this is not a great investment to make plain and simple."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm probably closest to the one on the right, while OP is probably more like the one on the left:

I rescued her a couple years ago, and I'm guessing she was on the streets for a while, or she was abused, but I was never given any of her history when I adopted her. She used to be SUPER scared of everything, including me. It took a while for her to become acclimated to me, but she still gets startled by sudden noises or movements. She's much better than she was originally, though she still doesn't really want to play very much, and she gets low-key scared if I try too much. So I just try to do stuff that won't scare her too much. She's still a good girl though. At least she comes to me when she calls now, but mostly because she just wants to be pet 24x7."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,price being this stable meaning everyone is holding and that flash crash hedge fund tried the other day got bounced back super quick meaning it is bullish as ever! The more negative sentiment around GME the more you know hedge funds are getting fk. It doesn't cost us anything to hold but it will for them and with Ryan Cohen at helm GME will never go bankrupt so think positive. Ryan Cohen will not pull a rug on his investors

2021-03-14 00:17:07,wallstreetbets,"Shorters got their synthetic long locked into funds I think short interest doesn't really matter, even if at 10% (which I doubt anyway)

Excluding retail the % held by insiders + the % held by institutions (mostly passive funds, ETFs, etc) is around 150%. 

They simply can't close all position. Insiders won't sell that much. Institutions are mostly passively managed, thus more diamond hands than us apes.

If we add retail we may get some % points of diamond handing. 

THEY BROKE THE SYSTEM, THEY CAN'T CLOSE ALL OF THE SHORTS.

GME price target = HF's wives"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe the numbers may be even higher. https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/stockdetails/nys-gme/fi-a1tyxm a lot of places like fidelity report odd retail ownership percentages.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I understand what it means for short interest to be above 100%, but I'm a little confused by % held by institutions being over 100%. How does this work?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Most of the institutional holdings are reported from 12/31/2020. It is old data. The ownership is much lower now as a number have sold (e.g. FMR had to report their sale due to being over 10%).
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Why  institutions  cant close positions they will make shit lots of money if they do.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Better question to Ask is how many shares do retail own. 

IMO i think at the very least 30mil"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nonsense.

Exartee will balance down, since they are overweight af, but due to the growth of gme to 18ish billion market cap, _tons_ of EFTs for mid and large cap growth and blend will _have_ to buy it.

Nomnomnom"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe they bought some of the stocks that where shorted and if let‚Äôs say the short interest was 200% meaning every share was shorted, an institution can own an original unshorted stock and 1 stock that was shorted (borrowed and sold to the market)"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Total ""long interest"" = total short interest + float.

So if the float is 50M shares and the short interest is 10M (25%) then there are 60M shares (125%) held in long positions.

This is because every short sale sells to someone, so it creates an extra long position as well an an extra short position."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a good point.  The >100% or whatever number for institutional ownership is from when the SI was up over 120%.  When it squeezed in January and the SI crashed, the institutional ownership must have dropped a lot as well (as they sold to the shorts who were scrambling to cover)"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,RECALL!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The Russell rebalancing in June gonna be fun too
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This also. Because of GMEs size it is now basically mandatory on indices and in many portfolios.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This makes sense. Thanks.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is incorrect. However I replied above it‚Äôs not that many shares so I wouldn‚Äôt expect it to be hugely impactful either way.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the info. I definitely wasn't sure. It just seemed odd to me that they wouldn't need to call them in first. But I guess if you or I trades on margin and sells we don't need to pull them before we can sell.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah basically if you have a margin account you don‚Äôt own your shares, the broker does. If your shares are lent it has no impact on your ability to sell because shares are fungible. ‚ÄúYour‚Äù shares don‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs just a pool of shares. The authorized participants that create and redeem ETFs are huge institutions with huge pools of shares."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hold up, how can I get rid of a margin account? So if my broker goes bankrupt... I lose ‚Äûmy‚Äú shares? xD 

I want to move to Interactive Brokers"

2021-03-13 23:31:18,wallstreetbets,"üê≥ ü™ì Whales to Watch 3/15: VIX Addicts Anonymous **Update 3/15 morning**: There was some I really liked but forgot to mention here like AMD, they‚Äôre listed over at spotrambo.com 

Grabbed some VXX at 13.82 some NOK at about 4.30 and MA at 381.96. 4/1‚Äôs, 14 4.50 390. Grabbed more VXX than anything cuz I‚Äôm nervous. 

****

Guys, your boy AllDatDalton has a problem.  

Sure, it's a little fun when it pops, but after buying VXX and holding overnight, it always gives me the hangover of loss.  It always ends the same: my account is in disarray, I feel a sense of hopelessness, and everything in my life I'd worked toward to that point is eviscerated by terms like ""Stimulus Checks set to arrive...""

But *this* time...this time it really could be different.  **The FOMC is coming up this week starting March 16th**.  [For the unitiated, this is an event where not much is often decided but much is bet on; the FED gives their guidance in matters including‚Äîbut not limited to--Quantitive Easing, Interest Rate speculation, and Bond Yield Curve control.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/think.ing.com/amp/article/us-what-to-watch-at-the-march-fed-meeting/)  Market volatility precedes it, as the oracles all scramble to determine what poppa Pow might or might not say or do‚Äîif the man farted into the microphone and walked away, VXX would probably climb 15%...the tension is *palpable*.

**This one couldn‚Äôt come at a more precarious time, as good news is now bad news**.  As reopening moves full steam ahead and we get a massive injection of economic stimulus, people are beginning to stop taking JPow at his word.  He promises a steady hand, he promises no interest rate increases, he says bond yield curve control is always on the table....and yet deep pockets flee en masse from stonks and into treasuries as the good times roll. 

**You see, the problem with the FED right now is no matter what they say, investors see the inevitable trend**.  They're betting there is only so long the FED can continue to artificially support the market--and only so long there will be reason to-- as indexes roar, the actual economy improves, and vaccine distribution is, for the most part, on track to return us to a world of pseudo-normalcy by summer.  It doesn't help that the FED stays verbally doveish while quietly doing things like declining to speak on Yield Curves definitively during speaking engagements, and [quietly ended the term repo m lending program](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/fed-ending-term-repos-reflects-liquidity-feast-for-dealers). 

**My choice here is between treasury-tickers and the VXX**-- last time I was making this choice I went with VXX on the DD, and that choice didn't pan out until the second week.  I said then, reflecting on that week‚Äôs losers, that I should have chosen treasuries...**so why didn‚Äôt I this time with the opportunity right here?**  *VXX is just absurdly low right now, trading under $14*.  I'm not saying the pop will happen Tuesday or Wednesday, but it may, and dollars to donuts if you hold a VXX 14 or 14.50c 4/1 you'll make some money at some point if you don't hold too long after it makes a run.  Also, if Jerome breathes a word about Yield Control they will plummett. 

**This intro is also my way of admitting my confidence level this week is low‚Äîthere is too much potential for chop**.  Sure, I could be wrong and we go to the moon once stimmies start hitting people‚Äôs accounts, and that argument is fair as I see some of the new age commodities mooning to ATH over the wekend.  But, for the most part, I'd rather put on a jimmy hat this week and hope my safe picks don't come back burning me.

But anyway, **you didn‚Äôt come here for my half-baked philosophy on impending market volatility.  YOU CAME CUZ YOU HEARD WE GOT THEM BAGGERS**.  So, let's talk whales.

***

**Shoutout to unusual whales who makes this possible through letting me share their pick info! They‚Äôre great!**

**Last week‚Äôs lovers**: **DKNG** absolutely crushed it. **Tier 2**, on a sustained measurement over the week, actually defeated Tier 1.  **OCGN SQ EBAY** all had magnificent moments in the sun aided by that crazy **4% NASDAQ Day**.

**Mid-week Pivot**: The **F** call mid-week was clutch on the 13c, and now it's sitting above that price to end the week.  Also, I know y'all were feeling the heat on that **T** mid-week pivot call, but Friday brought us the glory. I was sweating though üòÖ 

**Last week‚Äôs lesson**: **GE** and **DIS** were hotter than shit wrapped in tin foil coming out the gate on Monday, then they hit us with that nasty curve.  **News broke that GE was closing a huge deal on Sunday, which gave me continued optimism, and then they just demolished the call holders with that fucking reverse split**--if you say you saw that coming, you's a damn lie.  DIS got great news, but it was crossing a key 200 resistance number (is that TA?  I don't know man, I think so), and couldn't hold.  I **think the key here is it‚Äôs okay to take a pause on the pick if it‚Äôs hot fresh out the gate the week of the RAMBO.  There will be more picks.  The other lesson here is that when the event is big enough, it plays like an earnings rather than a pump**.  DKNG, for example, had pump written all over it.  It was more about future potential than earnings in the description. Conversely, the GE annual event had an ER feel, particularly in articles I read Tuesday.  **Meme stock pump event=good.  Boomer stock boring investor event=be wary.  Stock crossing a big round resistance number leading into an event=watch how it behaves, and if it dips catch it post-event.**

**‚ÄùNever lost, just ran out of time‚Äù**: Someone pointed out in a comment the M 3/26 20c i went with from two DD's ago is puh-rinting.  Should've held I guess.  Womp Womp.

**Tier 1**: Dice I'm Rolling with this Week (intriguing whale bets, with RAMBO (non-ER pumps), sectors or tickers I like) *disclaimer: this may be choppy as week enter positions on dips, long dates*

[MA](https://i.imgur.com/ufR3TrB.jpg) ([3/23 B of A electronic payments symposium](https://investor.mastercard.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))

When I said playing it safe I guess I meant it lol.  MA is going from your grandfather's favorite holding to an interesting FinTech play that is showing malleability in a fast-paced industry.
[They're doing cool stuff like this merger with Payoneer](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/fintech-payoneer-partners-with-mastercard-ahead-of-3-billion-spac-.html) and, for better or worse, they've joined the growing list of companies linking their perceived fate to the commodity that shall not be mentioned.  

I just generally like the stock, but I think this conference presentation will be a great catalyst as they have a chance to expose some of their new school thinking and get some nice quotes for FinTwit pumps.  Getting in early in case stimulus excitement waves can give a little push in banking and financial processors, but weary of entry because of FOMC.

[NOK](https://i.imgur.com/EL3aSk8.jpg) ([Nokia Capital Markets Day 3/18](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news-and-events/events-calendar/investor-relations-events/capital-markets-day/))

**Me two paragraphs ago**: I'm playing it safe this week.  **Also me**: Let's pick a failed meme that is a favorite of foreign bots.  

Someone in the comments on my last DD was pumping this, and I kinda didn't pay it to much attention at first.  But, they had some interesting things say about NOK, and convinced me that the foreign de-listing wasn't as big a deal as people were intimating. 

Sometimes you gotta plug your nose--*hate the stonk, love the RAMBO*.  **The general consensus around this event is that this is moment NOK needs to do SOMETHING to please investors**.  NOK is also sticking to the messaging that this a strategy reset of sorts.  The key pump factor here is *whether or not they will set a definitive dividend policy*--that's what I'm watching for.  If we get the dividend announcement, the sky is the limit.  If we don't, well, bail out quickly, because this sinking ship may head for Davey Jones' Locker (I'm so corny bruh üò≠ ).

[Somebody did a solid DD write-up on NOK](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m33vsq/full_diligence_post_on_nokia_nok_ahead_of_capital/) pre-event at r/investing.  I'm sure the sub will be appalled that I'm mining their shit for options speculation lol.

[VXX](https://i.imgur.com/CdGUT8U.jpg) (FOMC March 16-18th discussing potential yield curve control, etc)

The intro pretty much states where I'm at on this. **I like the 14c 4/1**--my plan is to wait for an assumed green open Monday, and see if I can pick up a nice premium price just before the classic fade.  **I‚Äôm going to hold until it pops, through the FOMC RAMBO**, and if the markets don't go red i'll probably trim some for a loss but keep holding for a level of general volatility.  If we open red Monday, I'll let action settle and push out to the 14.50c probably.  I dunno, I'm just a dog chasing cars.

**Tier 2**: Watching with great interest

[ABNB](https://i.imgur.com/XinYxt5.jpg): No rambo, but look at this crazy ass whale bet that came through with hilarious VOL/OI. People are betting on reopening, sure, but this feels welrd as hell and i love it. 

[CRSR](https://i.imgur.com/W0soBkU.jpg): No whale betting, but some other UOA and I am very intrigued by their event coming up on the 16th, **The Macquarie Consumer Bright Ideas Conference**.  Sounds pumpish, and they're trotting the CEO out.

[GPRO](https://i.imgur.com/tdX3a7c.jpg): Tons of consistent whale betting matching performance of an uptrend.  Been on a tear, so may need a little dip to get a good entry point, but I want to follow the money on this one.

[CS](https://i.imgur.com/5D7VBrd.jpg)/[DB](https://i.imgur.com/QnUyMK4.jpg): boring financials plays without UW bets, but still pumping nicely in other UOA registers.  CS has a conference presentation the morning of 3/16 and is releasing their annual report on 3/18. DB has a presentation on 3/18.

****

Remember, this week could be super flukey, so long dates, timing your entry, and the ability to HODL are key.  I'm genuinely not excited about this week, not gonna lie.

**TLDR**

This week could be choppy with FOMC, so I'm grabbing some **VXX**, playing a longer **MA** call for a spicy safe haven, and buying **NOK** leading into their capital markets day as a purely speculative play.

**AAPL** has a rumored product launch coming on the 23rd, **CRSR** has an interesting conference, and **GPRO** continues to recieve bullish whale bets.

Inbox always open.  Happy hunting everybody."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Not trying to be an asshole here but geniunly wait to buy any VX Future ETF till at least Wed. They are rolling into one of the worst contangos I've ever seen. Just buy spy puts brother and hedge it with UVXY puts.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,When bond yields increase that means people are pulling money out of bonds. Fyi
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"GPRO has been very good to me over the months. I live in Colorado and when the cities shut down, the parks opened up. Picked up a few hundred shares back in April cause I noticed a lot of people using gopros on hiking trails. They're also a big earner during black friday and have usually a very substantial sale at least once a year so they aren't going anywhere anytime soon I'd imagine."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,CRSR! üöÄüöÄüöÄ
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for these! Made some easy coin on DKNG last week. Husband thought I bought stocks in ‚ÄúDonkey Kong‚Äù when he got the notification of the buy in his account. Good thing I do the investing ü§£
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Still holding CRSR. Regretting not getting in on DKNG like a fool. Still love these post
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,CRSR $45 4/16 seems super tasty at 0.68. Money loss really starting around the 18th so if it doesn‚Äôt pan out like hoped then there‚Äôs time to get out.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Followed your last weeks post with GOEV, Dkng. You are the tendieman."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you think about NOK leaps Jan 23? They're pretty cheap right now
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think GE will stabilize and recover from here. Not a bad play at this level. Bought some apr/may/June calls. 

I also like CRSR this week. Strong bounce off of 30, and solid recovery. I think premiums got crazy earlier this year, and the stock got ahead of itself. Looking to recover from oversold."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,RAMBO?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is there a specific reason we don't have a show on Reddit's little public access TV thing they do?  It feels like we should have an hour a day where we just have a featured DD'er put CNBC and Bloomberg to shame.  I seriously would put /u/AllDatDalton, /u/NrdRage, and /u/DeepFuckingValue up against aaaaaany analyst on TV. I recently found /u/bauer5x too, and he seems up there."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,GPRO definitely looking like a good play next week.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Enjoyed reading this thanks for some more stocks to watch. I like seeing some of the ""stock that shall not be named"" posts but honestly how many Gorilla post can you see before its time for a nap?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Love your DDs! Probably a typo on your end, but NOK‚Äôs capital markets day is 3/18."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Followed you on GE and DKNG last week. When DKNG had a tepid response to the investor day I sold most of my contracts to get back to even. Luckily, I held enough through Friday morning to cover the losses from GE. Stupid reverse split. 

I'm liking the VIX idea for the week, but if this is an IV play, wouldn't it make sense to do a straddle and just hope that the IV increase is enough that no matter which direction it goes you make money on both (but more on the side it goes)?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Good stuff. Been waiting on more since your last DKNG call!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I just buy a small number of UVXY calls each month or two. It comforts me knowing if the market completely crashes I'll still have an account.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"What are your thoughts on MSTR? Optimism about that one thing becoming a tool to hedge against inflation/ adopted by different companies and countries propelled it to from $600 to $1300 in one week. Although afterwards, it declined like Tesla starting Feb 9th and even went to $547. Now it is back up to $784.

This weekend, that one thing reached a new ATH and MSTR owns 91.3k of it. Their plan is pretty much selling software/data tools and to store that thing. Their market cap is around 7.5 bil and the 91.3k is around 5.5bil.

You think with stimmy coming, fears of inflation, and the news of that thing hitting ATH/ in New price discovery territory will make MSTR gap up a lot next week?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I killed it on an overnight DKNG play last week.  So far these plays are panning for me.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Love these, dkng came out for me last week im just a shrimp tho. Wait for the weekends for your post. We really appreciate it"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Great info! Looking at some MA calls for July and they expensive af
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,GPRO for the win!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"VXX I'm confused, first time reading it and doing some research.

Do you expect Market tanks, so VXX values goes up (currently at $14, so e.g goes to $16)? so you're getting 

$14 Call to expire on April 1st?

Dumb question, but if VXX is always design to go down in value, wouldn't buying PUT makes more sense?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great post brother. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Also, keep your head up ape. Invest smart. Maybe shrink your positions next time so you don‚Äôt feel that hopelessness"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Love these weekly posts, thanks!!"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm a little foggy on how VXX works, can you give me a tl;dr"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder how much legitimacy alternative theoretical currencies would have to gain before mecha Jerome Powell stops dropping the ban hammer on their mentions
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,guess i bought the wrong expiration dates for vix.. (17th march)
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah GE was quite a gutpunch.  Had 650 shares up around 2 bucks each on them that I didnt even have for a month and they go pull that shit. Sold half of em at 13.40 probably the only smart call I made all week.  GE was the only part of my portfolio that did well on friday even Vistra was down by a good deal for reason I cant even fathom.

Anyhow I got a lot of 10 UVXY calls for 8.50 so what you are telling me is I'm gonna make bank on Tuesday?  I also got puts on TLT hopefully it all ends in a shitstorm and I'm up thousands by ends week.

Doom and gloom is my GME I just keep throwing money into UVXY every week hoping that this is the week it happens but no the best ive gotten in the past month is that one day it shot up close to 11 and I had a 10 contract lot of 8 dollar puts.  Made close to 2 grand that day lets just ignore all the other weeks."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't know the difference between VXX and VIXY but the internet says you can use either to hedge against a downturn. So last week I got 30 shares of VIXY at $12.07. Hopefully I didn't do something stupid.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,No prob friend
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol you mean my dumbass actually did something smart buying UVXY calls fuck yeah!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same, my 70c printed and 85c I wish I bought more"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,My NOK average is $3.95. Also have May 21st $4 calls. Finally seeing NOK move up. 19th is make or break.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre such an asshole sharing that pertinent information in a timely manner üò° 

Lol kk thank you for this information. IM IN DANGER"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a guy debating this VXX play on Monday, I really wish I knew more to know what you mean by your comment. I‚Äôll just take it as a sign to sit this one out...."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes yes. Sorry always get turned around explaining the inverse movements of yields, participants, market effect, etc lol"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"They also have a profit margin of 35%, and more cash on hand then debt."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,üåö üåö
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same - bought 35 calls last week expiring this week. 
Hopefully it blasts out on Monday."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I think they print
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruh I missed when they shot down to 0.18 for like a hot minute and rebounded to .23 5 minutes later
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Handshake
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck yeah me too I got 10 of em shorter term though mine are expiring Friday.  Was hoping to unload them the same day since the bond yields were up alot figured vix would follow suit.  No dice.  This gives me hope though
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you! Fixed
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It would make more sense actually lol. A lot.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you explain more what you mean by straddle for the VIX play?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks bb
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol the ol‚Äô UVXY bwaaaaankey (blanket)
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I think all sympathy plays of that thing are about to take a moon mission this week. 

I‚Äôm hoping it holds because MA has a lot of that thing too. The key for MSTR is that thing better hold through the week because the sympathy plays receive zero grace on a bad day for it"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think this and SQ is a good play this week.
The corn is flying.

But FOMC could be a killer.

I‚Äôm hoping to sell all or most of my calls by Tuesday morning."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Very welcome
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thx bb
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it was intended as a long hold yes, but I just want that FED VXX spike. Luckily VIX doesn‚Äôt have to up to high for IV to shoot it‚Äôs ass up

Puts are a good long term move but you have to time it right because as VIX goes down IV screams down"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"VXX is about short term speculation, not a buy and hold (unless you buy and hold as a hedge against everything tanking). Yes, it's designed to decline to zero in the long run - but for a day or a week or an hour, it can spike quite a bit."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs a bad way of saying it


But I agree anyways

A few calls might be a great hedge against the 2 day onslaught the fed brings against the market


Unless against the odds the fed comes out and forcefully says things like:

hey dipshits stimulus can be deflationary, 

go walk downtown and see how many buildings are closed or how many are behind, 

Short term inflation is due to a lack of supply from port shipping holdups

Or just overall counteracts some of the overly rosy pictures that the news is showing

....Then....

The market will dive again, tech will lead and VIX will seem cheap


And right now the fed is basically using wishy washy language and in no concrete terms saying things like, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about inflation bro, we got this‚Äù

And Wall Street says stfu retard no you don‚Äôt

TLDR: fed talks like vlad, needs to talk like dfv"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I wouldnt even own shares in it since it naturally declines and you can pick up call options sporadically for a fraction of what you paid for those shares.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I gotta know, why did you buy VXX? The charts show it going steadily down for months now"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets," Notice how UVXY really caved right at close on Friday that was Proshares dumping some of the March ones at friday right at close. This effects VXX as well since they are holding the same product.  When you dont see march futures here you ""should"" be better off. You'll still get decent returns if your right but these VIX ETFs are kinda fukt rn

 [ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF | UVXY | Daily Holdings | ProShares ETFs](https://www.proshares.com/funds/uvxy_daily_holdings.html)"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its not that the OG poster is wrong... You can still make money if he is right but VXX and UVXY or any etf that tries to follow the VIX are either in a ""contango"" or ""backwardation"". These are important and simple to understand. We are in a nasty nasty contango rn which is means uvxy bleeds money until they finish their march roll. It puts a shit ton of downward pressure on anything holding VX futures."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Just play the actual VIX
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for your insight. I try to tune out of any biases and directional plays, but it has been insightful in learning the different ways others approach finance/stocks. I truly hope you continue to succeed in your endeavors and allow others like myself to track your multitude of plays even if we don‚Äôt buy in ourselves. Thank you for providing me with an opinion and insight that could be considered an education."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Good enough for me!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok. So it's a matter of figuring out entry point. Other than posting attention to vix as a measurement device I've never played it. So you think it's likely to stay pretty stable Monday in anticipation of Tuesday's remarks (once morning insanity is done)?
Though, the more that I look at the VIX, the less like a good idea this seems. Vega is .006 which is stupidly low (SPY is .09 as a comparison)."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You buy an at the money call and put for the VIX. IF it goes up or down one of those will be in the money. Usually, the hope is that the stock moves enough that the gain on the direction it moves offsets the loss in the other direction.

But, if the overall idea on VIX is that there's going to be frantic movement after JPow speaks, then what major movement can do is increase implied volatility (IV). When IV increases, all options increase in value because the underlying is moving more so the market makers want you to pay more because they have greater risk due to the larger movement (look at how GME can move 150 points per day).

So if IV increases enough, then it's possible that both the call and put will increase in value due to the IV. Then you're making money on the direction it moves because of both the IV and price change, and you're making money on the other direction because of the IV increase.

It depends on how much the IV increases. Right now IV is \~70% for ATM contracts. If there's a major move, and it jumps to \~150%, then you're making money on both sides. (GME, as a contrast, has IV of \~350 for ATM contracts, which is why you're paying $40+ for those contracts).

The straddle reduces the risk of betting wrong. But it loses money if the underlying bet is wrong. That is, because you're buying both directions you need a big move. If it stays relatively stable, then the theta decay from buying Monday selling Tuesday will kill any profit. And since it's an IV play, you probably don't want to bet on many days of increased IV, so you're probably not holding till Friday unless you sell the opposite direction quickly and hold the direction it moved for a bit assuming it keeps going that way."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,TBF UVXY drops harder and faster than VXX.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This week I can finally sell palantir and rebuy at 20$


Thanks fed!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because I‚Äôm a hopeless VIX addict in the spirals of addiction. 

My first hit of the sweet VXX was last March. I‚Äôm chasing the dragon"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"VXX trending steadily down is normal.

The VIX is a calculated index that is based on the ratio of calls to puts on the various SP500 companies. I don't know exactly how it's calculated, but it's intended to be a sentiment metric. When VIX is high, the aggregate of open options positions indicates that we expect volatility. When VIX is low, open options positions indicate things are expected to be steady.

You can't directly trade VIX but it is possible to trade VIX futures. That's what VXX is. It's a fund made up of VIX futures.

Like options, futures contracts have extrinsic time value. Like options, futures contracts have a delivery date - meaning their time value is subject to theta decay. 

So VXX is constantly buying VIX futures, holding them for a preset amount of time, and rolling them into further-out contracts. This means VXX is constantly losing money due to time decay of the underlying futures contracts. 

IIRC, the design target is for VXX to decline to 0 value over a 10-year period. After ten years the fund is dismantled and a new one is created to replace it.

TL;DR VXX is intended to gradually decline over time and should only be used for short-term speculation or as a small hedge."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,If you invest long enough in any Vix etfs you'll eventually lose everything. They are designed for short term trading.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What is your opinion on someone‚Äôs comment of playing both sides in a straddle on VXX? Personally I think the movement could be big enough to profit but hopefully it can cover losses at the very least.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Glad you‚Äôre entertained! That‚Äôs the goal üòä

https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/VI*0/futures-prices"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Why?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Well because if nothing dramatic happens you are guaranteed to lose money.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the advice! Spy puts aren‚Äôt as leveraged as VXX calls though right? Would about SQQQ calls? Would they be safe from contango?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also, why buy puts Monday if we‚Äôre expecting an increase in volatility post Monday?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just putting too many variables into the broad market. What if a selloff triggers margin call buying on GME? What if GME triggers a market selloff?  


Maybe I'm overthinking it, but I'd rather be wrong and miss out than right and fuck myself over."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"But how does that make it not cheap?

If I buy a pound of carrots for a nickel and then don't eat them, I'm guaranteed to lose money but it was still cheap."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Because the contango on the Vix ETFs is so bad the VIX could spike to 25 and you'd probably only get a 1-2% movement out of VXX or UVXY the next few days. With VIX being under 21 on friday just go with SPY puts or TQQQ puts if we get an increase in volatility the puts will explode way more than a Vix etf call will. not trying to bash this play just giving some advice to maximize the return. Alot of new investors jump in to these volatilty plays not realizing they are 75% of the time capping their potential gains

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Go for the juicy ones. That make you question the situation brewing.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude exactly my point. This is absolutely the best stock you can pick compared to a bunch of bloated garbage on the market rn. This actually makes a difference in this world right now as we speak and it‚Äôs only worth 2 billion dollars right now and not 200-400 billion. Mind boggling as fuck. Someone debate this with me and tell me what is it I am missing. I would really like to know.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve never heard of it till now and only 56.30 million shares outstanding with average 2.30 million shares trading last 10 days. Thanks for the tip
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Hidden gem for sure.
2021-03-13 23:25:30,wallstreetbets,"Hey üåàüêª I got a real juicy üçåfor you - SKLZ I have reason to ***believe*** this company could lose like 90% of their revenue **OVERNIGHT.**

**Don't** look at my post history unless you need proof **I'm retarded**

I've dumbed down my ***beliefs*** to **2** core reasons

**Their Monetization Model is insane, you have a better chance winning at the casino than you do betting on SKLZ games.**

* On average, players have nearly a 7% statistical edge going to the casino and playing black or red on roulette like a smooth brained dummy fuck (This is literally my favorite way to play roulette so I know what I'm talking about)
* Let me break it down further, going off of the fact that they take 14% of all bets on average(You'll have a hard time finding this on their site - [https://www.skillz.com](https://www.skillz.com/) \- but this Bloomberg article mentions the 14% fee [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/skillz-soars-in-trading-debut-as-investors-bet-on-mobile-esports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/skillz-soars-in-trading-debut-as-investors-bet-on-mobile-esports).
* So let's say you want to make 10 bets on a SKLZ game. You bet $50 on each game, and so does your opponent. The matchmaking system knows to put you with players of similar skill so unsurprisingly, the 10 game streak ends in a 5-5 draw. Both players will have lost $70 in this situation. If the streak went 6-4 in your favor, you would have earn a measly $16 dollars. SKLZ appears to only want to increase this percentage. I refuse to believe this pricing model will have an appeal to mainstream audiences when they see how hard players are getting boned.

**Where does Apple's 30% take of In-App purchases fit in?**

* Of this 14% taken from each betting transaction, what is Apple getting from the cut? I am having trouble finding any evidence that apple is making money from these bets that are taking place on their platform. I have reason to believe that SKLZ may be bypassing Apple's 30% fee, as 14% is clearly less than 30%. SKLZ apps allow you to put money into an account without going through the app store. 
* **Fortnite got banned from the app store for doing exactly this.**
* If games using the SKLZ plugin get banned from the app store, this company will lose all revenue it earns from the App Store. What would this scenario mean for the stock being that it's currently valued around $10 billion dollars as a hyper growth company that doesn't seem to have apps on any other platform?
* In the event Apple is getting a cut, how much are they getting? What kind of special treatment is SKLZ getting from Apple? We need to hear from Apple about this companies monetization model. 
* How much longer is Apple going to allow $200 Million Dollars of revenue to go through at a fraction of what they are typically owed?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Cathie is high on sklz and you‚Äôre telling me to be a bear. I‚Äôll go with her any day of the week.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Some December 10 and 7.5 puts might be worth a buy
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm going look into this further, because I am really surprised that Apple will allow gambling. 

No idea what SKLZ business model is or anything- I just really don't think a company like Apple will allow a gambling app on their store.

No positions atm- looking into what SKLZ is and if Apple has any other apps on their store similar to SKLZ. If they do not, that would be proof enough for me that SKLZ is not going stay on their store."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This. Sklz is just getting warmed up and the street loves em
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"For most people, the lottery is spending a dollar for a tiny chance at early retirement and banging supermodels instead of lot lizards. Solid business model."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,So you just don't think these things exist when they obviously do? Lol there's no research to do. Apple does allow these apps on their store which is fucking obvious because people have been talking about these betting companies for awhile now
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"True but at least those are based off of actual football games. For a company to write a program for a game and then have you gamble if the program works in your favor...that's kinda a slight sketchy difference.

Also idrk what draft kings is I just assume they are fantasy football? If not ignore this whole post."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel like I live in a cave cause I never heard of it before lol.

I know draftkings and Penn national."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh 100% agree with you. The problem is that that no matter the risk people some people are eager to gamble. The rake is nothing compared to FanDuel. Give idiots with money a way to risk it to make more they will, over and over again. This place is filled with straight morons that probably opened an account and played a few games for due diligence. But basically one dude that lost 100$ on this idiotic app will tell you people will use this app if allowed."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree haha. Few retards here (including myself) would probably make more money on skillz than in the market (or at least lose less lol)
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,My bet is lose more:( can confirm from recent losses. Computers scam me out of my money.
2021-03-13 23:16:46,wallstreetbets,"Hear me out guys... First off, as an individual who started trading around August 2020, I am incredibly grateful for this community and dumbfounded by the incredibly talented collective of traders active on Reddit. I only started using reddit as an equity/creeptoe resource in January. So thank you for allowing me into your world.

Having watched the deluge of brand new traders flood into Reddit this year (myself being one of them), I‚Äôm equal-parts euphoric and terrified. While there are some incredibly wise contributors to the cause of effective retail trading tirelessly pouring their efforts into moderation and quality content, there are 50x the amount of naive, greenhorn traders, many quite young.

As I begin to gain my bearings in this insanely abnormal market and test my ability to stomach volatility, I can‚Äôt help but notice a dichotomy forming. A healthy fear of bots and shills is absolutely necessary for the battle we have found ourselves in. But division amongst an army creates a very easy weakness for powerful anti-retail entities to exploit.

I believe the strength of the Reddit army is also its greatest crux: its decentralization. While there are likely hundreds of thousands of wise, experienced traders within the ranks, there are MILLIONS of brand new people here screeching at each other using autism as an excuse.

Autism is a way of life, not a tool for irrational and emotional rejection of anything that does not serve confirmation bias. Reddit has allowed retail traders a chance to not just sit at the table, but flip it over and piss on it. Which we are currently doing (love you fuckers). However, if we begin allowing emotions to take the place of spirited intellectual and informed discussion, we simply won‚Äôt amass the momentum needed to bowl these fuckers over.

I‚Äôm not saying to take it easy on dummies and dicks, getting rammed for being an idiot is insanely helpful as a young trader. But try at least a LITTLE to have some patience for the n00bs and guide them. They are our children. The most attractive aspect of Reddit imo is the inclusiveness of the community. 

Let‚Äôs not lose that spark of magic that brought all of us here to begin with, as millions of young people look to us and this beautiful place to help them take control of their own fates, as we all seek to do with our own.

Thank you for reading my rant. I‚Äôm not a shill, I‚Äôm not a bot. I‚Äôm a dumb ape that doesn‚Äôt give financial advice and likes watching banana become bananasquared."

LLY LLY is the maker of PROZAC and if you are anything like me you feel like you need some after not buying GME at $5 .. Should you buy GME after it rose 50x ? I'm kinda scared to do that even though I'm a retard. And I hope I'm wrong and GME rises another 50x for all the APES that are in YOLO positions.

AMC is only up 5x and holding $10.25 WHICH is possibly bullish. So, we can all pop a prozac and go the movies and escape our sour thoughts on missing out on the GME frenzy :) .. This will help both those stocks if you feel like they are a good alternate investment. Time to cheer up the old fashioned way :)

It is entirely your money on the line. Personally, I have a very specific goal in mind with $GME. I am in at 22 shares at about $222. I stand by this movement, for many reasons, and for those who bite that potential loss in the name of change I honestly salute you.

But the nature of the market is there will always be bag holders. I accepted this risk, you accepted this risk. In the coming weeks, please take DD with a grain of salt and do not let people influence your own plan of just instinct. I let myself get cooerced into buying it at around 340 a share like the degenerate I am; I lowered the average because I personally believe in the company long term, squeezes aside. But this decision cost me a lot. While I could cash out this very moment for profit, had I waited even a week, like I wanted to initially, I would have gotten in at not even half that lol. If you are in this for the squeeze, keep that goal in mind and don't let paper hand jokes and peer pressure make you commit horrible decisions with your finances. At the end of the day, a million people may cheer you into bankruptcy but I doubt a single one will stand by to lift you out of it. Regardless of $GME, $AMC, meme stock or a fucking boomer stock, you need to put yourself first above everything else. My girlfriend gave me excellent advice the other day I wanted to share with you all; treat this like an airplane crashing. Put your own mask on before you think of anyone else's. If you gotta stomp people like me down to make it out okay, do it without remorse. That's free market at work, honestly. We all take a risk for a big pay and we all can bounce back if this pays off. But please keep in mind a lot of people on here posting massive loss porn have safety nets in place;  Roth IRAs, good jobs, other plays to hedge losses, etc. Don't presume you can be a consistent retard YOLOing your life savings and walk away from it. I am turning 25 on the 23rd (Daddy Cohen is gifting me an earnings report ‚ò∫) and even just 5k is a huge play on my part. Be smarter than me; be an autist.

God speed, retards.

P.S. Mad respect to the dude who convinced his girlfriend to tattoo her ass. That was hilarious.

P.P.S. not fixing typos; I am high on Xanax.

P.P.P.S. I really don't care if people label me as a shill or some shit. This is just common sense; remember some of the 8 or 9 mil are actual children. They need a slap from reality. And yes, I am an asshole but I am at least not one with my head up my ass."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"> I stand by this movement

Now that we won and Melvin is bankrupt there is no reason to support the 'squeeze' theory.    There has never been a gamma squeeze and you were swindled by stock salesmen with the help of reddit.

You could sell now, but I would also try and recoup any losses and damages from reddit's upcoming $6billion IPO.

I have a class action lawsuit on the way pending a police investigation for breaking the Canadian Securities Act."

This means this play is from the future! Everyone $LOAD $CUM in this ass!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn't selling on the way down be real dangerous? I sure as fuck dont want to paperhand too early, but I assumed I'd be shit out of luck if I got too greedy and held too long. What should it look like post peak?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Due diligence. Doing your homework. As fun as a yolo can be, usually you want some idea why you should hop into a stock. DFV is the most recent famous DD source proven right, given he argued wayyyy back how right GME was as a move. He got there by doing DD and letting others critique it.

Look at some DD threads. They're like number porn."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Melvin is not bankrupt, nor has a squeeze ever been confirmed to have happened. THIS is the kind of shit I am talking about.

Isn't like the 6th rule of this sub no bullshitting? Unless you got evidence of that claim, I suggest shutting up. The squeeze is based on mathematical principles that could very well still happen or may never. We don't know until it happens; what we do know is $GME is a great long play for those who can afford to wait."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol ü§£ i know man just busting your balls let's make üíé outta üçå together
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is risky yes but I can live with the regret of missing the peak. From what we learned in the first mini squeeze, the price started decreasing gradually with short bounces to the upside but the general trend being the price moving down.

Although the short squeeze will be different. The price should increase rapidly, a few halts a day whilst the price goes up. We will see wild volatility as whales cash out and/or a significant proportion of retail, but the shorts buying back should be a greater force and should be a temporary blip. When I see the price moving down gradually with no sign of it recovering I will consider selling"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Melvin had to liquidate their position in Ali Baba and have moved their retirement fund.   They are preparing for bankruptcy March 18th.  This is confirmed on github.   Believe what you want. I rather you think for yourself.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You say I went full blown retard and you say you're holding to a meme price number?

 Bro, how you gonna look dumber then a 41 day old account.  Do you even trade bro?   69,420.69 lol.   
    
 At least OP is honest saying he would undercut you to sell in a heartbeat.  

   You however, are actually trying to get people to hold till an impossible number.   Why?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You do realize there‚Äôs a difference between being serious and a meme target price right? That aside your arguing both sides, saying a meme price is to high while saying this dude is spreading FUD and that he‚Äôs in with the hedge funds. Everyone is welcome in the community but at least make the bare minimum attempt to understand the culture that‚Äôs going on here."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"So your claim now is that if I go to the DD page.  I won't see 34 different DD's all trying to explain why 69420.69 is not a meme. 
   And I won't find you posting rocket emojis either, huh?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You seriously need to put on your They Live glasses before coming here. This is a space that includes everything from retail meta messaging to hand on heart DD.

The fact is that if retail hold the potential upside at the top will be insane and literally life changing for anyone who bought in with an amount of money they consider ""large.""

The odds of the crowd (swarm, they call us on Forbes now, claiming we've got new tools (chainsaw vs crowbar) for playing the short squeeze game) correctly executing optimally is very low. A lot of effort is being spent, not wasted mind you, keeping the swarm directed towards as optimal an outcome as possible. Memetic warfare is not priced in and it's cheap to wage, and normal people have an asymmetric edge now thanks to our immersion in social media.

Don't get it twisted, there will be some retards that lose everything. They often started with nothing. But most people are going to be okay and make generally selfish decisions when the pressure increases."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What in the actual fuck? Are you the other person posting in r/stocks that I‚Äôm also having a petty internet argument with? My argument is that if/when the squeeze happens it‚Äôll go up and then crash after. I never made a claim about DD to you except in my comments on another thread. Your either actually brain dead and looking through my comment history or also that other guy in which case your also retarded.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea I‚Äôll post some fuckin rocket emojis and talk dumb shit about a meme price target but it‚Äôs just a meme. I as well as everyone else should sell when they see fit. I honestly have no idea what your claim is even since you‚Äôve basically been claiming both sides.

2021-03-13 22:54:22,wallstreetbets,"This won't end until Hedge Funds exit their short positions Best case scenario is we get a squeeze within the next few months. The worse case scenario is another round of paperhands (due to the attention we're getting) causing another selloff. But, here's the kicker:

It literally doesn't matter. Yes, I believe the stock will squeeze, and soonish, but let's consider a hypothetical situation in which we squeeze up a bit and these little paperhands sell off enough to cause panic (I realize this kind of sentiment is against the status quo here) -- this cycle will likely just continue. Shorts will be too proud to cover, stock will dip and then slowly rise, more will fomo in, and the cycle will repeat. This'll happen over and over again I'd imagine.

What I'm getting at is that the Hedge Funds just need to realize this will never end. We *know* they're completely underwater. We smell blood in the water. Delay it as much as you can, I guess, but we're gonna get that ass.

Regardless, hold and buy. Tendies await us.

&#x200B;

Edit: To be clear, holding *through* dips is paramount. It helps the MOASS which will bless you with infinite tendies, but also, trying to time any cycle can cause you to miss out on said unlimited tendies. I'm merely hypothetically speaking about worst case scenario which isn't all that bad, regardless.

Edit 2: Here's me predicting the situation we're currently in right after the first squeeze:

 [(10) GME holders are basically in the best situation. Hear me out. : wallstreetbets (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb64o1/gme_holders_are_basically_in_the_best_situation/) "
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Stock go down = I buy more; stock go up = I hold and don't sell; stock explode and lands on the moon = I sell some of my shares so others can profit of high prices. Will I sell all my positions? Never will.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I think if it dips to double digits again we‚Äôre going to see insane volume. People know now what it‚Äôs capable of being shorted to the tits and the general populace has figured out this is a better bet than a lottery ticket so there‚Äôs going to be a decent amount of public support.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I kind of hope this happens instead. Imagine knowing you can make 5-10x gains every few months? It‚Äôs like the world‚Äôs greatest ATM.

As in, if the massive block of calls expiring this Friday is not replaced by an equally large number of new calls being sold at later expirations, the MM's will be free to unload the millions of shares they bought to hedge gamma. Much larger impact than retail paper handers.  


Not sure when I will sell but it's important to know the bear case and the bull case on your positions."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Idc if they keep delaying and ppl paper hand. We know it will just keep cycling like that so use that cycle to your advantage until the MOASS

2021-03-13 22:13:11,wallstreetbets,"ASTARTES!! GET IN AND HOLD GAW.L is the ticker, games workshop is the company

Last year a 5 part mini-series was released by a fan animator called the Astarte's project, It released to massive acclaim whilst being only 15 minutes long in total, if you are aware of the 40K universe and story that is part of the main line of games workshop products you have probably seen this and its my bet that you think its the best animation that has ever come out of that IP.

On April 2nd 2020 the final part was released and at the same time the value of the stock skyrocketed doubling its value in 2 and a half months alone. going from $4000 - $8000. currently its sitting just under 10K  after peaking at 12K in November and is in position to swing either way.

Roughly 2 days ago games workshop announced that they had officially hired the guy to work on more animations along with a handful of other lesser known but still greatly skilled fan animators that are loved in the community. This recent news is in my opinion a good sign of an upswing, along with their recent and ongoing collaboration with marvel, for better or for worse, it seems quite popular.

Warhammer has been on the verge of breaking through to the mainstream for years and years, but I believe with this recent news we could expect gains real soon, particularly the Astarte's project news, back when it released it attracted a whole range of new fans to the IP, simply on the quality of the animation alone.

And to further tickle the pickle of anyone on the fence, they pay good dividends!

(I do hold a small amount of stock in GAW.L but i am not a financial analyst and what i say should not be taken as financial advice, this is simply based on public and consumer opinion alone, rather dry on mathematical analysis)

My argument also rests on the fact that the patron for Astarte's project isn't going anywhere, that is a dedicated community that still have money input and real input in the project and as i am aware that side is not even influenced by GW, I think GW have learned some lessons in their days, some, not all, so I'm still wary as I am with any acquisition of an Indi artist by a corporate entity."
2021-03-13 22:04:54,wallstreetbets,"Slide into these $DM's Listen up retards, Desktop Metal is about to announce their first earnings on Monday, and they are looking juicy.

First, Institutional Transactions last Quarter were up 314.23%. Someone wants this company to succeed, and if their Desktop Metal 3D Printer does what they say, then this company absolutely will. Insider ownership is almost 40%, and that doesn‚Äôt hurt either.

The price rocketed to $34.94 in February, but has since fallen with a lot of other tech stocks. This is the time to buy.

They offer their printers as a Hardware as a Service model, which I may personally dislike, but the lower up front cost is a benefit to consumers when printers can cost anywhere from $15,000 to $120,000. And if the desktop metal printer can make end use metal parts IN AN OFFICE, then manufacturing firms are going to want one. I know I do. HAAS also means monthly recurring revenue for assets that the company still technically owns.

And this company isn‚Äôt only hiring, they are hiring a MERGERS & ACQUISITION CORPORATE COUNSEL!

So they are either looking to buy out some competition (maybe Markforged?) or get bought (3D Systems? They were the OG's, fell of the face of the earth, but are rebounding). Either way, I like the odds.

2021-03-13 21:49:17,wallstreetbets,"GME Technicals, DD, short interest This will be long apes so please bull with me. This is going to be a breakdown of GME's chart from a technical perspective as well as my thoughts on the short interest and where this is all going. I would just like to apologize in advance for all of the lines on my charts. I am fucking retarded and my smooth brain needs lots of lines, but I'll try to make it easy to understand.

**Technical breakdown:**

On the 20 day chart, we can see that GME is going up in a stair-step pattern, which is obviously extremely bullish. A stair-step pattern is where it rises up, consolidates lightly, then uses the previous resistance as support for the next stair-step. We are currently in a consolidation phase of that stair-step. As you can see, the red lines that I circled were previously resisstance but are now support. This is bullish.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sacw2jztcum61.png?width=2218&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ee1373bb21434559cf835cd9cc96e27d3151c9b

Next, and probably one of my favorite things, is the fact that on the day we went from 348 all the way down to 180, we had STRONG support at the 180 level, which, as I said above, was the resistance from the first step, which is now our support. Even better is the fact that our current consolidation is forming a pennant pattern from that support. A pennant pattern usually indicates that a stock will continue its trend (in this case up). This is extremely bullish, dare I say... apeish. The orange lines show the pennant pattern that I'm talking about and the two circles show the high and low of that pattern (lmao also kinda looks like a torpedo cock and balls). It's important to note that although the chart makes it appear that it will be breaking that pattern soon, the pennant could just extend, so do not think that it's going to break the pattern on Monday because though it very well could, it could also just continue consolidating:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5q6m693wcum61.png?width=2222&format=png&auto=webp&s=f323375e4cbe77a09f904504c074dadee2823c5a

When it finally stops consolidating and breaks this pattern to continue rising, the green line above should act as support for our next stair step, which would put us at 350ish for support, which is huge.

For the 90 day chart, you can see that a few weeks ago we broke the giant triangle pattern, which is how we got into the current bullish movement. Those lines are yellow:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7gwk7ocxcum61.png?width=1586&format=png&auto=webp&s=1955427bbbc72fb02af1766c5a04ec80403e2960

Finally, in the chart above, I have marked the areas of CRUCIAL resistance. These are the fat green, yellow, and red lines. I made them those colors because each one that we break is more crucial than the previous one because of the last squeeze.

**What to take away from the chart action:** we are currently in a consolidation period of a stair-step pattern that has happened because we broke the triangle pattern that we started after the price went down from the last squeeze. This is very ~~bullish~~ apeish. Again, I apologize for all the lines, I'm a technical trader and I make a shit ton of support and resistance lines for my smooth brain.

**Volume**: everyone is talking about the squeeze, shorts, and price action, and blah blah but the thing that everyone needs to be talking about is volume. VOLUME VOLUME VOLUME. The ONLY WAY that any type of squeeze can happen is volume. I know that people don't like the VW comparison (and I'm not comparing them here, just using this as an example), but the squeeze was only able to happen because of tremendous volume

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iiet237zcum61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=82223652adfe00a84ee32197351b72cef79b9785

As far as GME's current volume, we are not there (but don't get down on it becuase WE WILL BE). The only way for shorts to be squeezed is for a major influx of volume to drive the price up significantly, forcing them to cover. In the previous squeeze, volume spiked tremendously and would have continued to increase if brokerages wouldn't have cut off buying. The CEO of Interactive Brokers even said that the price would reach over 1k if they didn't shut of buying, why? Volume. So, for GME's volume, it's plain and simple, it needs to increase (but I will not that the fact that the price is increasing so much without massive volume is even more ~~bullish~~ apeish).

**But Hank, how does volume increase?** Excellent question, tard brain. For GME, and most stocks but especially GME, catalysts are what drives volume up. Below is a picture of GME's volume since the January action:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rcu25cl0dum61.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d90f2c7ba53929f73b6dfbc02d2b9f23f84c7a2

The first spike in volume was in late November when Ryan Cohen announced his stake (but the jump wasn't super significant). The first big spike that you can see is on January 11-13ish when they announced that Ryan Cohen was being added to the board. In the next few days we see volume decline but still elevate compared to previous levels because of increased media attention. The next jump in volume (lots of red) is when Andrew Left of shitron had his week-long down-syndrome tantrum about GME and get his cheeks clapped by WSB. This giant volume orgy is continued for the next few days when Elon tweets ""Gamestonk,"" Chamath buys a bunch of calls, and other celebrities like Mark Cuban voice their support. We then see volume teeter off because of the brokerage cucks ass ramming us. The next spike in volume corresponds to when GME ousted their CFO (many thought that Ryan Cohen led this). We then see volume decrease a little. Volume the picks back up when GME announces that it has appointed Cohen as the head of their committee on changing GME to a digital company. Volume has since gone down a little, but the price has gone up (erection!).

**What to take from this**: Plain and simple, volume is king. Volume is your wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's boss's wife's boyfriend. We cannot have another squeeze without volume, BUT volume, especially in GME's case is greatly correlated with catalysts.

**Volume Catalysts**: Here are some potential volume catalysts that could lead to the massive spike that we need: GME appointing a new CFO, GME appointing Ryan Cohen as CEO, better than expected earnings, an acquisition, support/investment from big names (i.e. Cuban, Elon, Burry, etc), new committees/initiatives/anything relating to their digital transformation, quadruple witching day March 19th (still not sure how I feel about this and definitely don't think it's the be all end all that many others do but it could certainly help). Overall, it appears that the best catalysts are ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and digital transformation. Personally, I think that if during their earnings call Cohen announces he's gonna be CEO or announces some big digital move, that will give us the volume we need. It's important to note that it appears that Ryan Cohen wants this to happen (and why wouldn't he, his net worth is tied to it) as evident by the tweets that he's put out that, though cryptic, seem to be implying support of WSB and hatred of shorts. Roaring Kitty has also been very cryptic lately and it appears that he thinks something big is coming too (this is just speculation tho, I'm tard).

**TTM Squeeze and MACD**: Two of my favorite indicators are MACD and TTM squeeze. I don't wanna explain them here because I only have so many chromosomes available to me each day, but they essentially indicate momentum. On my charts, I combine the MACD lines with the TTM squeeze because they move similarly and I think that TTM is superior to MACD's histogram. As you can see, on the 1-year chart, the MACD is in a VERY bullish pattern right now. What I'm more excited about is the TTM squeeze (the colorful bars). In a TTM squeeze indicator, the light blue lines indicate that the price has extremely bullish momentum (it's in relation to Bollinger bands and keltner channels). When the bars turn dark blue, there is still bullish momentum, but it's fading. The red bars indicate bearish momentum and the yellow bars indicate fading bearish momentum. As you can see, are currently in some VERY Strong light blue bars. For a TTM Squeeze, there are usually 7-10 light blue bars in an extremely bullish pattern. From the last squeeze, you can see that there are like 5 really tiny light blue bars and then like 3 bigger ones. This indicates that we are currently in the middle of/approaching giant price action, but also that the current price action is better than last time and is forming a more stable, high arching uptrend. If you're thinking, ""oh man Unlce Hank, we've already had 5 light blue bars, the squeeze is almost over"" - not so fast tard. Though I said that there's usually 7-10 of these bars in an uptrend, that's not always the case, and going to dark blue bars simply may mean that we are consolidating and will go back to light blue bars. Overall, all this should show you is that yes, we are in a bullish trend and things are looking perfect. This is one of my favorite indicators and I believe that it's giving us INSANELY good signs.

&#x200B;

**A note about squeezes:** Let me be clear, if the brokerages wouldn't have cut off buying, this would have gone up past $1000 (IB CEO said this and he's a boomer-cuck). Because of this, last time was not a short squeeze, it was a gamma squeeze (or a series of them). A short squeeze would have resulted in a parabolic move to the upside accompanied by a parabolic jump in volume. Both the price and volume would look like very tall and skinny triangles (see the Volkswagen pattern for this). A short squeeze does not happen over time, it happens suddenly and very violently to the upside. Gamma squeezes, on the other hand, can happen over a period of time and can happen in small or big chunks. It's important to note that gamma squeezes can cause short squeezes and short squeezes can exacerbate game squeezes (it's a feedback loop, which is why it's so dangerous). So, currently I think that we are in the middle of a series of gamma squeezes that could lead to a short squeeze if there is a catalyst that creates volume.

**Shorts:** A lot of numbers have been floating around about short interest. Some say it's 13%, 27%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 120%, and well above 200% (I've even seen 900%). IMO, it's impossible to know right now. FINRA's release said it was about 50% and that's the one that I believe to be the most likely (definitely don't believe FINRA's 27% assplay). HOWEVER, it's important to note that those 100%+ numbers very well could be correct. The reason for this is because they can't take into consideration naked shorts (if you don't know about this there are 100s of DDs about it). So, IMO there are 2 scenarios here: 1. It's literally just 50%ish short interest on GME. Let me be clear, THIS IS STILL HUGE. Anything above 30% is huge, so 50% is still amazing and has massive short squeeze potential for GME. 2. It's actually above 200%. If the latter is true then the squeeze WILL 100% happen and will also probably crash the financial system because, as we know from 2008, when institutions get into these shady, unregulated derivative bets on volatile things, it usually creates a collateral effect. Personally, I have no clue which one is correct. The latter obviously sounds like a conspiracy but could very well be true because we all know how shady these funds are. However, it begs the question, ""why are they still doing this?"" The answer to this is they are either retarded (and not in a good way), doing it out of anger and spite (and we all know how well emotional trading goes), or they are in a bind and can't get out of it. Personally, I think that the conspiracy about naked shorts and everything is either extremely false or extremely true. If it's extremely true, then HFs are just kicking the can down the road hoping that we lose interest and the price decreases. If it's false, then we still have 50% short interest, apes, and Daddy Cohen. **TL:DR on this paragraph:** short numbers are conflicting and it's impossible to know which is correct or if the naked short theory is true. Either way, I like the stock.

**Closing thots:** The most important thing, as I said, is fucking volume. This is not just gonna magically happen. Sure, the price could very well keep increasing over the coming days/weeks on low volume and small gamma squeezes could happen, but until we get a surge in volume through a catalyst, we are not going to see the short squeeze. REMEMBER, the squeeze has not squoze until there is a parabolic move in price and volume over a very short period of time. I'm talking trading getting halted 5+ times in a single day on the upside. Do I think that these next few weeks are going to be very important, yes, especially next week and earnings week, but do I think it's over if not, fuck no! So with that being said, please try to avoid talking about dates as a certainty because it could lead to some of the younger tards selling because they're disappointed. Make sure to do what Rensole does and say that it COULD happen, that it's a possibility, not that it's the endgame or a certainty. Finally, continued talk about GME, continued buying and holding, and continued retardation are key. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, I SIMPLY HAVE A SMALL PENIS AND AN ADDICTION TO CUCK PORN.

**TL;DR**: I Like the stock.

EDIT: I also wanted to add that though GME's rising price action could be considered ""crazy,"" it's market cap is honestly not crazy. People usually get caught up in the price but don't look at the actual market cap. GME's current marketcap is only about 18B. Is that overvalued for where the company sits at this current moment? YES. But, if GME makes a shift to the digital space and becomes the go-to for literally everything relating to gaming (and possibly gambling), then a 100 billion dollar market cap is very reasonable. This is why DFV likes the stock. I think that he was originally in it for the short squeeze, but now I think that he is truly in this company for the long run because of its potential, and I couldn't agree more! "
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's wrong to make such assumptions about DFV when his views on $GME is easily avail via his YT livestreams- he WASN'T originally in it for the short squeeze. In fact, he specifically stated that in [his 8/28/20 livestream](https://youtu.be/2Af9T8TU2OM) at 1:20:06.

""Someone asked what's that upside potential on a short squeeze there...**forget the short squeeze, I mean the short squeeze is so difficult to forecast**, but like for an actual business model change...if it becomes a go-to place and ppl really wanna shop there...it's ten-bagger. You look at the legacy historical free cash flow."" -DFV

By letting the share price run up and **then** suppressing the price with short selling attacks, shorts damper momentum, sentiment and position their shorts even higher.

Shorts want this to go up within a set range so they can make money slamming it back down. They certainly did that on Wednesday, slamming it from $350 and covering on the way up from $180.

They will do it again. On Interactive Brokers alone there's almost 1,000,000 shares available to borrow at a 0.9% APR."

If enough options are realized, there is enough increase in purchasing, or short-interest becomes to high for enough shorts to hold any longer, that will drive both price and volume.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol so good
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you break down the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù for each Greek? Why does the Theta cause the price to drop? Who determines the Theta? Was considering buying some 3/19c for GME but the Theta was like 2.5 or something super high.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now my retarded question, the $0.45/$0.23 etc etc. are for all the stocks or just for this one ?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Delta is the thing smart guys talk about on youtube. Theta is the reason your calls lose money when the stonk goes up. The others are greek letters, except for vega."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre welcome, good luck, and don‚Äôt forget your helmet"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The greeks don't cause the price to change, they are a measurement of that change.  I have the actual price of the option and the price of the stonk at any given point up to right now because I can measure that shit by looking at the data or something.  If a stonk sold for $10 yesterday and $20 today, then that's a change of $10 dollars.  If at the same time the options went from $1 to $2 dollars in exactly the same timeframe, then what actually fucking happened?  Well the stonk doubled in price and the option doubled in price, so what's the rate of change in the stonk price and what's the rate of change in the option price?  Take the ratio of those things and you have Delta.  Now look at the delta you calculated yesterday and compare it to what you just did.  What's the rate of change?  Whatever number it is, that's Gamma.  Now look at the change in price and fucking pretend that none of the other shit changed.  What's the rate that it changed?  Theta.  Now do the same thing you did for Delta except use the IV instead.  Congratufuckinglations, you've got Vega.  Now do a bunch of the same calculations on those greeks and you get the second-order greeks that are all weird.  Like vomma.  What the fuck is vomma?  Basically yo' Vomma is so fat, IV crush is what happens when she sits down.  I don't really understand the usefulness of the second-order greeks but the calculations are the same.  


I could be wrong about some of this because I'm at that weird place where I'm too drunk to do calculus but also not drunk enough to be good at calculus."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"That I‚Äôm not 100% sure about, so I don‚Äôt wanna say something wrong. 

I believe it‚Äôs all based on the Black-Scholes model, but I haven‚Äôt really taken a deep dive into that."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"An options contract is usually tied to 100 shares of its respective stock, so the $0.45 delta is per share. 

If the price of the underlying stock went up a dollar, your contract would be worth an extra $45 (100 x 0.45) and then the delta would become $0.68. If the underlying went up another dollar, you‚Äôd gain $68 that time from delta.

Edit: if you were talking about this contract specifically, no. Each individual contract has its own Greeks."

It was only $7 to $70..... and was one of the first to even get close to clearing the strike so I was kinda trying to learn the price movements by watching it. Still though I‚Äôm definitely gonna start to have defined levels where I begin taking profit at."

I followed the riot run up in 2017, never invested tho, and decided this was my chance to exit the matrix."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I think many people in this thread will realize the options potential through the mining stocks and will find their way around it. There is just too much money to be made.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,There are times we have seen 1.5 ratio. I agree that it's not sustainable. Thats where you cash out and buy leap puts. Lot of upside still.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I could DCA out of the position, try to sell them closer to expiration, or just wait for the contract date and let the broker settle it."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,We are all watching and supporting the GME gang! I appreciate your drive and I know you will find your opportunity. Keep striving and settle for nothing less than your best.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,That's why you play the options for these mining stocks
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Christ dude, RIOT literally mines the coins so it makes logical sense that as the price of the coins increases the price of their assets increase which then increases the price of the stock."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"OMG I worked with a group of these people in Sabah in Borneo!! This is such an amazing thing to do!! Orangutans are so close to being completely eliminated! The valley creating their habitat has been cleaved into two much smaller jungles due to illegal palm oil farming. Their habitat shrinks everyday they need the help so much!

GOOD FUCKING WORK!!

Edit: For anyone who sees this, every dime you send to these people will be used to the fullest extent. When I was there we ate rice, had power from small solar panels for a few hours a day and worked HARD on every project. Theyre based all over Borneo and work in tandem with tons of other NGOs on the ground to recover the habitat and create protected corridors. Money very well spent"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"well, this is actually beyond stupid, but as long as you don't have to sell shares if GME goes to about 180, there's a gap at 205ish that I think could quite possibly be support for GME to go above 350. But, please, it is very possible a double top/overextension can occur. PLEASE take some profit there"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,How can they write a documentary if the story isn't even over?

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao hasn‚Äôt even happened yet but people making documentaries about it. Jesus
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait does the writer have 16 shares of GME?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,That's weird they usually don't release this type of entertainment until the show is over. üëÄ. Not a shill just thinking out loud.. Obligatory üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is going to 100% be FUD talking about GME in past tense, also timing of release (people are just getting stimulus) is highly suspect."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The squeeze ain‚Äôt even squoze yet
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Can‚Äôt wait for my aunty to tell me to sell bc she watched a shill doco produced by abc

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,so you are telling me that Hedgefund are going to get recked in the next 7 days. Good to know.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeh I rather not let them get payed and waste my time knowing that you can only know the truth by being in the forum. They‚Äôll probably be as neutral as possible and not get anywhere with it or speculate that we maybe in the wrong. I would rather watch a lurker make a YouTube documentary saving all the key post showing the emotional roller coasting you guys went through, the heart warming moments, the good and bad. The truth from the lies. That‚Äôs something only a person that been here in the beginning or Jan or before will know"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"They should release it to AMC theaters also, just for fun.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Getting ready for that dislike button

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,why are the doing it before GME is done?

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm expecting FUD push with Cramer & Vlad involved and agreeing to have convo used. This will be a hard push for the idea that this is ""over"". Diamonds are encrusted and moved cash before the weekend that I know can be reimbursed with pending stimmy/taxes just to get ready for a last possible dip before takeoff! Can't be swayyyyyyed."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,How are they going to make a documentary about something that happened less than 2 months ago?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Just like this sub! Perfect
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I cannot wait to see which retards they picked for interviews. Hopefully this brings some positive attention to the playing field.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"they shouldve waited with this until there were actual facts about this whole incident, so far we know almost nothing for certain"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like this is just a quick cash grab play by Hollywood types who are working for Disney/Hulu.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,but shorting disney never ends well
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hulu isn't a publicly traded company, but the majority stakeholders are."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is just going to be FUD and releasing it right after stimulus drops and GME is on a strong rise. Just another way to change the narrative.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit that's such a good comparison. Lost my shit for a second lmao
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a series.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Mine is bundled with Spotify or I probably would too bc I never use Hulu

This is my first ever DD, with that being said please be nice, and let me know if anything is wrong and or if I didn't include anything important. Would love some **constructive** criticism, thanks. Also with that being said I don‚Äôt know anything about anything. I'm just some guy who read some stuff and compiled it all here. I can‚Äôt tell the future. I am NOT a financial advisor. I‚Äôm just an ape like all of you. PLEASE do your own research. Humans are known for being wrong and I‚Äôm no expectation. I‚Äôm bullish on this stock but it did JUST go public therefore there isn‚Äôt a ton of history for how the stock performs. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.

With that said. I hope you enjoy and learn something from this.

**Coupang Inc DD**

**Ticker - CPNG**

**Initial bullish info (for the apes who can't stand to read more than 100 words)**

* Talked about and known as the ‚ÄúAmazon of South Korea‚Äù
* Coupang has been the second largest e-commerce IPO since Alibaba
* Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018
* IPO jumped more than 70%
* Company was valued at $9B back in June 2020 and now is valued at around $90B with a market cap of 86B (at the time of writing)
* CEO‚Äôs a Harvard grad of the dropout (just like Zuckerberg)
* Coupang has the highest market share of Korea's E-commerce business
* Improved cash flow by almost a billion dollars in a year
* Similar to Amazon in early years with no GAAP profitability but massive cash flow
* Coupangs the most used online shopping platform in south Korea
* Coupang has continuingly growing branches in Food delivery and grocery services
* Coupang has same day and dawn delivery (place an order by midnight and get it by 7am)
* Eco friendly packaging
* Customer Base has grew by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)

Now for people who want wrinkles in their brain please continue on reading

**Quantitative:**

* Net Revenue for 2020: $12B up more than 90% from 2019
* Customer base Grew approximately 14.8 Million from 2019 to 2020
* Total net Revenues per active custom increased to approximately $256 in 2020 from $161 in 2019
* Gross profit for 2020: $2B also up more than 90% from 2019
* Operating loss for 2020: $500M down from $600M in 2019

Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018

2018: -1.5B

2019: -698M

2020: -474M

In November 2018 Softbank's Vision Fund invested over $2B with a $9B valuation which has since been increased to $86B

**Use of Proceeds:**

* Net IPO of Class A common stock was $35.00 and jumped to $69.00 (nice) once it was available to trade. However the company has stated they will not be taking proceeds from the sale of shares and rather wants to increase their capitalization, financial flexibility, and create a public market for their stock.
* Net Proceeds received from the offering are planned to be used for general corporate purposes including: working capital, operating expenses, and capital expenditures.
* Coupang is currently not planning to pay dividends and rather invest in themselves.

I really like this because they know exactly what and where their assets are and implies they will be heavily re-investing into those assets in attempts to grow them. Amazon has and is using the same formula by not paying dividends, not focusing on revenue, but focusing on growing their brand recognition and customer base (their largest asset). Amazon's TTM use of cash graph below which I predict will mirror Coupangs in the future. Again though, I don‚Äôt know anything.

üì∑

* **Profitability** (on a GAAP basis) was not positive. However from a cash flow basis they generated over 300M from operations and continue to generate cash flow in order to boost their operations and re-invest in themselves and grow their customer base, which continues to be their strongest asset.

**Opportunity:**

Korea's GDP ‚Äúgross domestic product‚Äù (overall economic performance of a country, usually over a year) is over 1.6 Trillion and a GDP per capita (per person) of $31,847. This number continues to grow year after year as well as is evented form Korea's 2010 GDP of 1.1 Trillion.

The total spent in retail, grocery, consumer foodservice and travel in Korea was $470B in 2019 and is expected to increase to $534B by 2024. (Coupang is in 3 of 4 of those sectors)

Total spent in E-commerce was $128B and is expected to grow to $206B by 2024. On a per buyer basis, e-commerce spending is expected to grow from 2,600 in 2019 to 4,300 in 2024.

**Management:**

Range of age for management team is 36-61 with an average of age of 46

* **Bom Suk Kim -** Founder, current CEO and Chairman of the board of Coupang. Kim has a Harvard A.B degree in Government and is currently 42 making him the second youngest billionaire in South Korea. Kim founded Vintage Media Company (food industry exhibition and event planner) which he sold in 2009 before starting Coupang the following year.
* **Gaurav Anand -** Current CFO since Dec, 2020 and previously served as COO (Chief Operating Officer) from Jan, 2019 to Dec 2020. Anand has been with Coupang since 2017 and previously served as Vice President of Finance at Myntra (A fashion subsidiary of Flipkart (an online retailer which Softbank Vision Fund also invested into) and held various finance positions at Amazon from 2007 to 2014. Yeah. I know. Exciting right?
* \*\*Thuan Pham - (\*\*awesome name btw) has been Chief Technology Officer since September 2020 and served the same position at UBER from April 2013 to May 2020. From 2004 to 2013 he also served as Vice President at VMWare Inc which is a software and technology company. Pham also has both bachelors and a masters degree in computer Science and electrical Engineering From Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (this guy basically is a computer)

Other members of management have some pretty impressive credentials as well. A number of them have worked in high level management positions with Amazon like Minette Bellinagan who served as Director or Global sourcing and private Brands for Amazon. Many of them also have history in the technology and e-commerce sector with a good deal of them having experience founding their own startups such as Kiro Kyung who is a highly skilled software engineer who started two tech startups before joining Coupang.

**Qualitative:**

Company Mission: To create a world where customers wonder: ‚ÄúHow did I ever live without Coupang?‚Äù

* **Same day and Dawn delivery** reducing delivery times to a matter of hours. (Like if amazon had the same promise of pizza companies with 30min or less delivery) People can place orders by 12pm and receive them by 7am the next morning with their Rocket WOW and Rocket Delivery program (similar to amazon prime and also includes groceries). Customers go to sleep and wake up like it's Christmas morning with their order right at their door. Same day delivery is offered for FREE, 365 days a year even the night before Christmas if needed. Customers can order anything from tomatoes to TVs for free next day delivery (better than any other delivery e-commerce players in Korea). 70% of the population (mostly in Seoul) lives within 7 miles of a Coupang distribution center. Operations span over 25 million sq ft across 30 cities.
* **Effortless returns** by tapping a few buttons on the app or website and leaving the item outside for pickup. No repackaging, no labels, no post office trips. Just leave it outside and any delivery truck nearby will come pick it up within hours. (much easier than amazon, eBay, UPS, FedEx, etc.)
* **Eco-friendly Packaging** cuts down the use of cardboard boxes by more than 75%. Items are delivered in a simple sleeve and sorted into protective bins. Eco-friendly bags that are completely reusable and replace almost all disposable packaging. The reusable bags are picked up by the delivery network for further use. Trucks leave full of products and rather than coming back empty, they arrive with returned packages, and the packaging of other orders which are then immediately used once again for another delivery.
* **Employees** work 5 day work weeks instead of the industry standard 6. Employees are provided with paid time off and full benefits. (amazon employees don't even get Amazon Prime. Amazon employees also have not reported the best working conditions. ‚ÄúPeople aren't the friendliest‚Äù ‚Äúyou're expected to work like a machine‚Äù ‚ÄúWork life balance can be hard‚Äù ‚Äúneeds more benefits'' etc.) Coupang Inc will also be granting their frontline workers more than $90M worth of stock and will be the first company in Korea to make their employees shareholders. 70% of suppliers for Coupang are also small merchant and business owners with under $3M in revenue per year. In the pandemic, small businesses on Coupang saw their sales increase by over 50%. Coupang now sits as one of the largest employers in Korea with 50,000+ employees and plans to invest over $870M into building seven new regional fulfillment centers, creating a projected 50,000 additional jobs by 2025.
* **Dynamic Orchestration** meaning their technology predicts and assigns the fastest and most efficient path for delivery drivers out of hundreds of millions of combinations of inventory, processing, trucks and route options within seconds. Packages are sorted at warehouses into protected, truck ready bins making the loading process much easier and faster for drivers. (can get more orders out faster.)

**Services:**

* **Rocket WOW Membership** is a flat monthly fee membership program which offers unlimited free shipping within hours of a placed order, dawn delivery, free unlimited returns for 30 days and **Rocket Fresh** groceries which has become the nation wide leading online grocer. The subscription based delivery was launched in October of 2018 and only costs $2.60! Within the first week of launch the service had over 150,000 users sign up and now has more than 1.2M users.
* **Rocket Delivery** is Coupangs FREE next day delivery service and the company has said to be delivering close to 2 million products per day which is the highest figure seen since the service was launched in March of 2014. Rocket Delivery continues to be the driving force for Coupang with people constantly wanting things faster, rocket delivery is a promise to customers that they will get their products on time, and when they need them.
* **Coupang Play** is a streaming platform branch of Coupang that is offered to their WOW members at no additional cost. Coupang Play is currently available for android users and is expected to be supported by IOS systems sometime this year as well as expanding into smart TVs and PCs. Coupang play has everything from Hollywood movies like the Spider-Man series and ‚ÄúBombshell'' to popular Korean movies and TV shows. (I‚Äôd name them but I don‚Äôt think any of us know what they are). Coupang play also has documentaries, educational videos, kids shows, and animations with features like kids mode and parental locks. Coupang play is in the market for exclusivity as well with being the ONLY streaming service in Korea where users are able to watch things like Bryan Cranston's show ‚ÄúYour Honor‚Äù and CNN 10. Stephen Kim, the head of Coupang Play is also on record for saying *‚ÄúWe are eager to bring content such as Coupang Play Originals to expand our offerings and make this new service even more enjoyable and convenient for our customers.‚Äù*
* **Coupang Eats** has also been launched which is now the largest online food delivery service in Korea, which delivers food to customers using only delivery partners directly contracted by Coupang. Coupang Eats also incorporates the tech and infrastructure used for Rocket Delivery and Rocket Fresh making delivery as fast, and efficient as possible.
* **Coupangs customer centricity** continues to be their most important asset as 70% of the population is 7 miles from a distribution center. The company has vocally admitted this and consistently and continues to *‚Äúpursue operational excellence and innovation‚Äù* in order to grow this asset and keep the customers they have. Customer Base has also grown by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)

Part of Coupangs business model states all of this and I would have re-worded it but it truly is perfect and I don‚Äôt think I could have done a better job. When I first read this part of their business model it only furthered my confidence in this company. Not to mention again that this is VERY similar to how Amazon approached their business in the early years. The statement is as follows: *‚ÄúWe believe the true measure of our success will be shareholder value created over the long term. Our long-term investments in building a differentiated technology-orchestrated network and customer-facing functionality have helped build a business that we expect will deliver significant growth and cash flows at scale. We have in turn reinvested to expand into new offerings successfully, such as with our owned-inventory selection, Rocket WOW membership, Rocket Fresh, and Coupang Eats, among others. We will continue to reinvest cash flows generated by our established offerings into new initiatives and innovations for our customers. We will choose to invest and maximize value for customers and shareholders in the long term over optimizing our short-term results.‚Äù*

**Top Risks:**

* Coupang is rapidly evolving which could lead to the inability to manage the growth
* Coupang plans to forgo short term financial performance for long term growth (Same strategy as Amazon so in my eyes not a downside)
* **Dilution:** The company has stated that there will be (was) immediate stock dilution to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price. Though dilution is sometimes seen as a bad thing, out of all the evidence from Coupang and the business model we know they are going to follow, I believe that this dilution is simply to raise money for further expansion. I believe this dilution is why Coupang had a red day on Friday and may continue to be red for the next few weeks or so as it levels out. This does not change my stance on the stock at all just thought it was an interesting point to mention since dilution can be seen as a bad thing as companies sometimes do this in desperation when they may simply need more money to cover expenses. However I think it would be stupid to assume this is the case with Coupang as it is consistently growing its assets and shows no sign of bleeding, as well as just going public. Still though, it lessens shareholders position and lowers P/E which is a measure of profitability, but again, we know Coupang is not focusing on this at the moment. All this changes in my eyes is that I‚Äôm going to watch the stock closely over the next few weeks and months to see where it starts to even out and show signs of uptrends and or downtrends.

I have tried looking around for other reasons why Coupang could fail or simply why it could truly not be the next amazon of south Korea but I have yet to find any info. If anyone does, a link would be greatly appreciated and I will edit with new info.

**TDLR:**

In my OPINION, based on everything I‚Äôve read and compiled here, I truly think Coupang has Unlimited potential. The company has continued to show strong growth and belief in itself. It's constantly expanding into new territories as is evident with Coupang Play and Rocket Fresh as well as consistently growing their main assets. Their management team looks very Promising with backgrounds in Amazon, Uber, and A fuck load of computer engineering. Year after year revenue has been up, customer base has been up, and operating loss and net loss have been down. This company looks very promising in my eyes and I definitely will be investing in Coupang in years to come.

Thanks to everyone who stuck through all this. Again it's my first ever DD so hopefully it's not too shit. I put a lot of effort and research into this and I hope y'all gain some insight to this awesome company. PLEASE let me know if there's anything I should‚Äôve included in this, I am hoping to get a lot better at this whole ‚Äústonks‚Äù thing. As you may have noticed I haven‚Äôt given any info on my position with the stock and that is honestly, simply because I‚Äôm waiting for my next paycheck so I can afford to buy some. I currently don‚Äôt own shares in Coupang but you can bet your ass I‚Äôm buying as much as I can the next time I have money to throw at the market. Wouldn‚Äôt you want to get into Amazon in 2005?

Thanks again, Onions. THIS IS NOT FINACIAL ADVISE

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'm sorry I cant reply to any comments, not enough Karma.

But I defiantly agree with the statement that Korea is small compared to the US and they will have to compete with Amazon if they expand to other Countries. Still don't think this means they can't be HUGLY successful in Korea.

Also I'm not sure when they can be profitable. 2024 maybe?

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you have used them before, the service is great, but partly because it's basically subsidized. I'm not so sure something like the dawn delivery can cross to profitability just with scale. Also there will be stiff competition in the coming years, with Gmarket, 11th Street (Amazon recently bought 30% stake), and E-mart and Naver partnership. Coupang's trendy ventures like CoupangEats, CoupangPay, and streaming service have potential but are second-comers to established competitions. 

They are a household name and injected $5 billion from the IPO, which they said will invest  largely into real estate for warehouses, so they could be in good shape, but it is currently way too overvalued, and I will consider buying at $20-$30 range which gives like a $40b-$50b valuation. I think this is reasonable compared to [JD.com](https://JD.com), which is a Chinese e-commerce company, which has 8x the revenue and valued at $130 billion."

Take a trip to China, and you‚Äôll quickly see many small ‚Äúimported‚Äù themed shops, where the everything in the store is imported. Coupang will allow the beloved Amazon model ‚Äúdistribution center directly to consumer‚Äù, thus increasing trust within the consumer in China who is ALWAYS skeptical about middleman tampering (or even corporate greed cutting one too many corners). Because of this, retail arbitrage of the smaller, neighboring countries is big business inside China.  

While I admit I‚Äôm not too savvy in the business and market caps and all that just yet, and couldn‚Äôt get through CPNG‚Äôs website cause it‚Äôs all Korean (perhaps with a well hidden language switch), I see this company sweeping through neighboring countries /territories like Taiwan, Hong Kong, China and Singapore in the foreseeable future."

2021-03-13 21:13:18,wallstreetbets,"Proof that HFs are lying to FINRA but that's fine cause they're ""self regulated"" + GME SI update. Back again with my colleagues derived SI, after it generated so much discussion last week (even ihor mentioned it) despite you fucks not being able to read. His replies to various feedback are below the data.

**Short Volume Today (Friday 12th): 5,793,090**

**SV%: 58.91%**

**His SI%$ range: 690.8% - 1038.8%**

**Daily Notes:** Oddly Slow day as fat call options expire as they were being boughten by the thousands minutes before market closed.  Extremely low Long volume, retail just holding. Off Market trades, bull instituations still carried us possible. Sizeable Shorts were place today.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vjdi2gnf6um61.png?width=1739&format=png&auto=webp&s=63064c5be8ceb4ee478af9640913eb3e6026b800

**New notes for data:** It's getting to the point where Short Sellers would litterally need to be 80% of all off-market and long volume trades to be under 100%.

I changed the formula for the cost of OM volume to match the lowest price of the days as the off market is mainly Darkpool trades.

**New Conclusions** We can conclude that the % of volume used for covering is far less than their average of 30.75% since the 15th of january as a result of a big ol' FOMO rally from retail and a bull effort from institutions hogging up that volume  Therefore, it is not crazy to derive that ***SI% IS OVER 700%***, with a cost well over 5 billion $ to do so.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:** What I found was a tendency for these Short Sellers to get cocky and not cover on weeks when you would have expected them to. This means some weaks with low SV% had HUGE net gains in shorts. This never worked in reverse in the data.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1j1f094h6um61.png?width=1031&format=png&auto=webp&s=c000f8086573c128e653722ed86117985e43b4cb

**PROOF THAT FINRA DATA IS IMPOSSIBLE**  If you were to take the FINRA DATA from the 15th of january to the 24th of February, you would find that they would've needed to Cover using 30-32% of all transfers for the entire month and a half.

*Proof 1: It would have been impossible for them to comprise that portion of the covering with the FOMO wave and GAMMA squeeze that was hogging the data at the time.*  This 30-32% is notable. There was a considerable boost in daily volume in that period. So, you are talking about a MINIMAL COST OF **34.46 BILLION DOLLARS** using my formulas from my previous data. That being the bare minimum amount... just to lower it to the SI% they said it was at....

*Proof 2: We have not witnessed a loss of* ***22.65 Billion USD or more*** *from institutions in that time. That would have been a net loss btw, no bankruptcies were seen either*  I said above that I noticed that Short Sellers did not cover when the data suggested they had the opportunity. That this trend never reversed, a High weekly SV% yielded a net gain in short positions.

*Proof 3: SV% has remained over 50% throughout the 15th to 24th period, which provides evidence of a net gain in shorts... not a complete dip of the SI.*  Lastly, if all this was the way they say it did, then...

*Proof 4: The stock price would not have dropped during the period if they had covered. The data* ***HEAVILY*** *implies that shorts are used and held to stop upwards momentum*

&#x200B;

**His Reposnse to feedback:**

&#x200B;

>Short volume % of total volume can't reliably tell you how many new shorts have entered or covered that day because below:A market maker selling you a share that they haven't yet matched up with an actual seller but do a few seconds later will get counted as a short position momentarily. This apparently can and does happen and gets counted in the short volume. Meaning exactly no new short positions were taken but the short volume went up anyway. (I believe this is actually explained on FINRA's website -[https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019))  On the flip side, it does tell you the absolute highest number of short positions that could have been taken that day so new short positions could be anywhere between 0 and the high short volume amount, but due to the above as well as shorts entering and the covering in the same day means you can't really gleam anything from it reliably. Sorry

1: What you are describing would create a net neutral movement on the share price, which was not seen.

More importantly, the data I aquired clearly shows that there was a net gain of shorts when compared to the long volume (which is where they could have covered) day after day after day. It is possible, but the data says that they have been creating more shares than they can possibly cover even if they were 100% of the long volume everyday (which, as we know, is 90% algos and day traders)

I look at things from a scientific lens. All I aimed to do was to show that it is financially and numerically ***IMPOSSIBLE FOR SI% TO HAVE LOWERED SINCE THE 15TH OF JANUARY***.  It was the running assumption that everyone who believed in this had, and I provided damning evidence for it being the case.

&#x200B;

>This is not how it works Not saying that GME short interest is X or Y. But literally this is not how it works you really can‚Äôt use short volume to determine short interest.  INTERPRETING DAILY FINRA SHORT SALE REPORTS  Mods please don‚Äôt delete üì∑ I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts about FINRA daily short sale reports and what it means. Importantly it doesn‚Äôt mean what you think. This isn‚Äôt FUD it‚Äôs just how market making works.  TL;DR a lot of the short volume is market makers shorting to facilitate buy orders and they immediately cover with the next trade.  -High short volume in the FINRA report actually often reflects net BUYING. This is why trying to interpret these reports is pretty much useless.  -That sounds crazy but that‚Äôs how market making works. -FINRA report is only for off exchange trades (dark pools). It‚Äôs a myth that dark pools are all institutional, your retail broker is sending trades to dark pools like Citadel, Virtu, etc.***\[14:02\]***\-A MM makes money on the spread between buying and selling (obviously). What happens is - your order to buy 100 shares of GME at market gets sent to a dark pool. The MM (a computer) SHORTS you those shares at $108.793 and then BUYS those shares back at $108.791. A short of 100 shares is recorded. This also explains how you see ridiculous volumes and ridiculous # of shorts every day for a stock that has a 50M float. The MM isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgoing short‚Äù GME. They short it for a millisecond then buy a fraction of a penny lower a millisecond later.  -So high short volume in the FINRA report (which is ONLY reflecting off exchange trades (dark pools) does NOT necessarily reflect high levels of actual shorting. It often reflects high levels of buying! Um. Like we just saw this week. Repeat that It does also does NOT reflect exchange trades.  You don‚Äôt have to believe me you can read this super interesting piece here. Generally speaking, the idea that large short volume in the report is good news for holders seems true! It‚Äôs just not for the reasons you think.

&#x200B;

I didnt assume you were FUD, but it's a little sus when you open like that hahahahh  same as my answer for the last one, my data clearly shows that financially and data wise, there are more shorts being taken on most days, where the only way for them to even be below what they were on the 15th would be for them to litterally bankrupt themselves in the process.  What you describe there would have a net neutral effect on the share price. Share price plummetted as Short Volume exceeded long volume. That is the fact. The data disagrees with your rebuttal.

&#x200B;

>No, this post is misinformation. You cannot gauge short interest from short volume. Because a majority of short volume is closed in seconds. I keep telling people this. You should really make a wiki or sidebar notice about short volume. So much misinformation and misplaced hype because of short volume. High short volume does NOT mean high short interest.  To be clear, i believe short interest is super high for GME, but not due to short volume. There has been lots of legit DD done on this. But focusing on short volume is straight misinformation propagated by people who don't know what they're talking about.

&#x200B;

3. Same as the top two. Maybe try and actually take the time to read my the data I took hours transcribing and making palletable before waving it off and calling me ""Fake News"" K?   In conclusion: the data proves that SI% has gone up. The only argument Ive heard is the ""they cover instantly"" one which isnt whats shown in the data at all (its litterally the entire point of me showing Short Volume Overflow, to show how many more shorts there are compared to longs daily). If it were true, we'd have risen consistently as this theory would have 0 effect on the share price. What actually happened is they shorted it to 40$.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

Personally, as in u/moonski 's opinion,  the feedback from you all is excellent and whilst I am still sceptical of the high %s, and the *total accuracy* of the derived info, I still think it is very valuable in at least showing that reported SI is esesntially, total horseshit.

All we really have is S3 & FINRA delayed self reported data telling us SI is constantly dropping yet price action does not suppport such a low liquidity stock being covered from over 200% SI in January...

Also very weirdly the data goblin himself Ihor of S3 aka the iHorse (hes @ ihors3 on twitter ffs) tweeted yesterday that GME is a 10/10 on his new squeeze score aka the ""squeezeometer."" How this is derived  is ""a secret.""  So it's 10/10 squeeze potential yet SI is plumetting, at a mere 15% according to himself... mhm

Thus I am still totally convinced that SI is >100%, and this data shows that there is no way it is what is being report by the likes of S3 or FINRA is accurate. What we are doing here, if not proving to you what the magical SI number definitely is, is showing that SI is *substantially* higher than what reports are claiming.

I am also certain GME has a significant issue with synthetic shares due to the volume of trading being a significant % of the total free float size of 50m (more like 24m in reality). AMC, a popular meme stock trades at 30% float, and most non meme popular stocks trade far, far, far lower than this in terms of volume / float.

Interestingly I did come across this - SI was at **132% on Feb 8th**, according to S&Pglobal (you know, the guys whos name is in the S&P500) in an article posted on Feb 18 - [https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/short-interest-in-us-stocks-declines-in-aftermath-of-gamestop-saga-data-shows-62699063](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/short-interest-in-us-stocks-declines-in-aftermath-of-gamestop-saga-data-shows-62699063). They later claimed on March 2nd that SI had dropped to 24% ""in mid february"" which makes absolutely no sense given price action - 132% to 24% as the stock hoves around $40. Ok then.

So yeah, enjoy your saturday evening assigned reading even though you can't fucking read."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll believe the S3 or FINRA when they can show us definitive proof of where the shorts have covered.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Citadel has paid 58 fines for manipulation and misreporting data. This wouldn‚Äôt surprise me in the slightest. Of COURSE they are lying.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Another **flaw** in your reasoning - re the S&P global report. Remember the new short interest report reflecting Jan 29th data didn‚Äôt come out until **Feb 9th**

*GameStop, for example, had a short interest as a percentage of float of 132% as of Feb. 8, meaning there was more short interest than the company had shares. That percentage was down to 46% as of Feb. 16, according to an analysis by CFRA Research*

So this is using Jan 15th data for the Feb 8th calculation. Then guess what? The new numbers came out and it showed... a massive decline in short interest. Therefore your own research shows that SI declined from 132% to 46% in the last 2 weeks of January. Oh, right when there was a huge spike in volume and price that everyone agrees would be associated with short covering. 

Can‚Äôt wait for you to say ‚Äúer never mind that S&P article was wrong‚Äù"

While i am all for hyping the gme train, And i do believe that gme is more heavily shorted than official reporting suggests. The declarations that gme short interest is 600%? Is just completely impossible. Its one thing for their to be over 100% free float( remember gme float is ~70mm so when SI was 140% it was technically only 100% of total float so they could technically get away with it) but suggesting that hundreds of millions of fabricated gme shares are in the market is just too tight of a tin foil hat to ignore. 

Seriously, you are actually suggesting that the short interest is 300mm shares? I mean come the fuck on dude please explain how that is physically possibly."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The finra explanation is right. On any day if short volume is high it could mean market makers are selling to apes with a naked short. BUT, over time the short volume cannot always be above long volume because that would imply market makers are going deeper and deeper naked short without covering. They can delay covering for 21 days but they have to either borrow the shares, which do not exist or buyback. I would change your formula by checking (short volume - long volume) vs available shares to short. Good luck."

To compare, when the SI actually was 120%, the cost to borrow was regularly in the 30% range (30% is ridiculously high)

The high margin requirement has nothing to do with the short interest; it's due to the volatility of the stock."

But if they ""passively"" try to acquire shares by buying primarily when the price is already dropping and there's a major imbalance towards the sell side, they can cover without actually moving the price up and rather instead just slowing the  drop.

Keep in mind that for every sell there must be a buy, so during periods where there is a lot of selling and the price drops, somebody will be acquiring those shares. Could be retail investors on the squeeze crusade, could be people swing trading the volatility, and could be shorters covering."

If we don't see any institutional selling reported over the next week (and they would be incentivized to, to show that the squeeze did happen), then there is theoretically no way a single short position could have been net closed during the first runup, because the only shares that were being traded then would have been borrowed shares."

That individual now also shows they have a share in their account, but that share is also in my account. We both own the same share, and both are legitimate, even though it doesn't make sense that we can both own the same thing. 

It's like this, but instead of buying one share, I buy 9 million. Those 9 million get lent out, and another institution buys 9 million."

This was the day before the latest orchestrated dip that had the 5 or 6 halts. Bear in mind that the website for Metatrader 5 shows an affiliation with Citadel and their logo.

It's still a significant amount of buy pressure, that's why I call bullshit on them covering that many shares during that timeframe. I don't believe there was a genuine interest to sell over 80 million shares in that time period. Do you? If so, where did those 80 million shares come from?"

That makes a lot of sense now. I was wondering why the magnitude of difference (220% to 70% was reported in some places but 110% to 34%) was the same but the numbers being reported were different. I guess I'm just super dumb.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What? Theyre not even trying to hide it anymore
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's supply and demand.  Rates are low because there is lots of supply  (shares are available to borrow) and not a lot of people looking to borrow.

I would not call 25% SI ""low"" (it's actually quite high) but it's not ridiculously high like it was for the latter half of last year.

All this talk about short volume is crazy; any stock with lots of volume traded is going to have lots of short volume.   As has been explained, MMs naked short regularly in order to make a market and provide liquidity.  These positions get closed almost immediately, because the last thing that a MM wants to do is build a large position (long or short) in anything, since that exposes them to risk.  The whole point of high frequency market making is that it's practically risk-free profit -- it's a bunch of small arbitrages.  

One thing to remember is that for MMs who make markets on exchanges, they must maintain a bids and asks at all times, no more than a certain distance apart (by exchange rules) and they cannot back away from a published bid or ask (by SEC rules) -- if an order comes in at their published price they have to fill it.  So obviously sometimes they will be forced to fill a buy order when they have no inventory -- that's short volume.  They will close that position ASAP because, again, they do not want to hold a large position (long or short) because that's not how they make money.  The idea that you can add up all this volume and get short interest is completely crazy."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most of the shorts were covered from 1/15 to 1/29. Everyone can choose not to believe this but literally all evidence points to that. The stock went from $40 to $300. Over 100M shares were trading per day. Reported short interest dropped from 61M shares to 21M shares.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"When it's already down to $60 or lower its hardly even worth selling anymore at that point. Might as well just ride it out. I mean how much lower can it really go from there. 

I don't really buy the opportunity cost either.

If you're bad enough at trading to sell at a loss the first time, what makes you think you can get a profit in the next trade? You may as well just buy another unprofitable trade making it even worse, while if you just stayed your position it would have climbed back up.

If you're in a dip it's more likely to go up. Selling in a dip is often a bad move unless the company really goes bust."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think they started off with 132% or even higher, and lied about covering it while shorting even more.

They might have already had more than 132% at that point, and had lots of illegal naked shorts. The reason I think that that is the case is because it's a common strategy to bankrupt a target company so they don't need to pay taxes over their profits.

The fact that they didn't close their positions when the price was $3 confirna they were trying to bring the price to $0. This may also mean they actively tried to bankrupt the company through fake news and shorting more stock than exists. If the company goes bankrupt, they can easily hide all the evidence of shares not existing because the company is bankrupt anyway. 

Except their plan failed so now they have to somehow hide the counterfeit shares, while also trying to keep the price down because they can't cover that many shorts. 

So they short even more to try to contain the price, while saying they covered. This is how it is possible for the real SI to be extremely high. 

Not saying this is definitely how it is, but it's a possibility."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are two things here that can lead to discrepancies.  

The first is that the finra data is a partial data set.  It is only for off exchange trades.  To get the complete set of data you will have to get the data reported by each of the exchanges as well.  So if someone shorts 100 shares and that is executed through a dark pool, it gets reported to finra.  If they later cover and that goes through the NYSE then the offsetting trade is in another data set.  

The second involves brokerages and also makes what you're looking at an incomplete data set.  Say you ask to sell a stock and your brokerage doesn't have enough of that stock on their book to cover the trade.  Well they go ahead and agree to sell the stock for X knowing they can buy it from you for X.  The sale gets reported as a short sale in the volume but the purchase they make from you did not get reported because it is not part of the official tape.  I don't know why that's the rule, but it is. It is just how finra and the exchanges agreed to report the data when they setup the agreement to ensure all of the data is collected in the same way.  I'm sure there's some esoteric reason as to why."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Strange how many here ""fail"" to understand the very clear and simple question you are asking."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,And you‚Äôre missing the fact that not ALL transactions are completed by market makers. Many transactions are actually shares trading hands. Market makers add liquidity and make money on the spread. They do not handle every transaction.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think it's really tracked that well. For instance, Michael Burry purchased a large stake of GME last year and lent his shares out (because you make interest on that) and tweeted that when he recalled them, it took weeks to get them back. They're not as organized as we think.

The 122% is typically explained as a function of time lag, in that there will be discrepancies due to the the lag in reporting between institutions that make transactions. Bear in mind only institutions that own greater than 5% are required to report, so institutions that own less report on a less regular basis. It's justified that we could see unrealistic percentages like that, but it's questionable if that's the sole reason. I don't think there's a way to tell if a share you're purchasing is borrowed unless a reconciliation is done.

You're right in that institutions would be aware if their shares are lent, but that doesn't track where they go. The crux of the issue is we have a tremendous amount of borrowed shares being held multiple times over (short interest), tremendous institutional ownership, tremendous retail ownership, and high options activity through next Friday (gamma squeeze) that all take a portion of what seems to be an illiquid stock, based on all the holders. This can only mean that the vast majority of shares being traded are borrowed shares, and the vast majority of transactions are algos and day traders; we're just waiting for the catalyst that forces a widespread margin call to coincide with an illiquid stock."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure how long you've been investing but this strategy will get you bankrupt in a bear market. In 2008 if I never sold the stocks that were tanking and put them in better choices or even keeping it in cash, I would have lost most of it. Even though the market eventually recovered it took several years. In that time I was able to make back most my losses by switch stocks and strategies. 

What we have been experiencing over the past few years is one of the best bull market runs in history so I can understand that you think that stocks that are tanking will always go back up...but this not the case at all. In most cases if a stock tanks it usually doesn't recover for a very very long time or it goes bankrupt and your done.

Show me a person that's been investing longer than 6 months that has never picked a dud before and ill give them money to invest and so would everyone else in the world. No one, and I mean no one, picks a winner every time. Even the best investors in the world pick duds sometimes. The goal is to pick more winners than losers.

I just gave you an example where opportunity cost most definitely was applicable. I bought amc and gme at the same time. I got into amc when it was at 13 bucks. It tanked down to 6 bucks and sold it and put in gme directly. If I kept it in amc I would still be down today but now I've made the money back and much much much more. It is most definitely worth it whether your original investment is 100 bucks or 50k.

There are time where holding through a dip makes sense and there are times where it's the wrong choice. If a stock drops from 400 to 60 in a week, it can literally drop to $1 or even go bankrupt. Hindsight is 20/20 we know now that gme recovered relatively quick so it was the right choice to stay with it. But at the time there was guarantee this would be the case."

Additionally, FINRA data is from dark pools. Dark pools don't affect the market price and aren't beholden to the market makers contributing to shorts by selling to retail and then buying. 

What we're seeing is basically all the hedge funds taking various short and long positions based on their options activity. Since the dark pools use market close price, you usually see the close price manipulated to favor the HFs who have to get the price where they want it for that day."

This is to avoid changing the overall net position of the market maker.  Only the first trade is reported for volume calculations, and in cases where the market maker does not have shares or is currently net short that first trade would be included in short volume while the second trade with the customer is not reported at all to avoid double counting volume."

>However, then in that situation isnt the short volume and buy volume increased by the same amount?

Volume represents shares traded, so 100 share transaction will always be 100 shares of volume, never 200.  Based on the link above, only the short transaction is reported in this case.

>Lets say im the costumer and I want to purchase 100 shares so my action of doing so increases the days buy volume by 100.

But then 100 was added to both the day‚Äôs buy (because of me) and short volume(because of the MM). Am I wrong by saying that?

The link doesn't specify with an example in which the customer is buying so I can't give an answer supported directly with evidence.  However, we know that an exchange of shares is only counted once for volume (the fact that you can have an odd number of shares traded for the volume makes this clear) so it isn't possible for there to be 100 shares added to both ""long volume"" and short volume.  There is also the issue of ""long volume"" not being reported at all and is just being calculated (incorrectly) by OP by subtracting short volume from total volume.  A trade is reported as X number of shares which goes to total volume, and if it is a short trade it is also reported as X number of shares of short volume.  Then short volume percent is calculated as (total volume marked short)/(total volume)x100.  Based on all of this I would assume that this trade of 100 shares where the customer is buying would be marked as short volume if the market maker did not have shares on hand, and would not be marked short if they had sufficient shares on hand to cover the trade.

This all makes more sense when you start looking at other stocks and notice that the average short volume is ~40% even for stocks not heavily shorted.  A large portion of that is marked short just due to how the market maker facilitates liquidity for trading."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"That seems retarded to me, if i buy X shares then it is possible for those shares to be counted toward the days short volume and not the days long volume??"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are 2 sides to every trade, same thing happens if someone opens a short position, it is still marked short regardless of what kind of trade is on the opposite side.  

Which brings up the other major issue, OP assumes that the opposite side of a ""short volume"" position is a long and ignores the possibility that someone opening a short position could be selling to someone else closing a short position.  Combining both issues and we can tell absolutely nothing from the short volume reporting.

Edit: Also keep in mind the concept of ""long volume"" is simply derived by OP and not reported."

On March 10th at approximately 12:10 PM EST GME shares hit a recent-high of $340.20.

Moments later volume SPIKED to 1M at 12:15, 1.5M at 12:20, 3.10M at 12:25

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pbv9jg2dztm61.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=a84781c16f675309307ed66b3d778e8fab5d90cc

&#x200B;

In literally 10 minutes millions of shares became available for sale and hit every single bid-ask on the buy side. Sellers OVERWHELMED buyers and the price tanked $140.

Ask yourself for a moment why a holder of stock would ever want to get the least amount of money for it? If you wanted to sell stock you would sell it gradually so as to not 'spook' the market. You would want the price to remain strong while you un-wind your position.

There is only one explanation for what happened: a massively co-ordinated short interest attack to inspire fear and simulate a Bank Run (when the average investor loses confidence in the Church of GME and fears the price is in free fall).

They're trying to create a positive feed-back loop of fear where eventually YOU sell your shares.

This strategy of 'dumping' massive amounts of shares is, as everyone knows, VERY COMMON. It's why you see the after-market tank. It's why you see the pre-market tank. It's why you see an EARNINGS BEAT and then the shares DIVE OFF A CLIFF. It's shorts trying to inspire a panic.

What's very interesting about this short attack was that it was obviously massively coordinated. There are MANY shorts in GME and they are all acting, to some degree, independent based on their cost-basis and level of exposure. Some shorts may actually be switching their positions to go long.

[In my post here I explain why GME could be legitimately valued at $500 a share.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m35u61/memeageddon_judgement_day_witching_day_march_19th/)

This attack on March 10th reveals that there is a MASSIVE WHALE that is cornered and willing to dump billions to get out. It's absolute confirmation that someone does not want to have to buy-back shares at these prices.

If you are up against the wall, as a HF, and either lose billions or make billions, you are juts going to keep doubling down. The wall street motto is ""Greed is good"" and THEY WILL NOT GO QUITELY INTO THE NIGHT.

So now that they have tipped their hand that they will try try scare everyone into a Bank Run here are the KEY psychological targets they may drop shares at this week. DO NOT PANIC!

**Important price 1: $250**If they can 'break' the positive momentum and get the price below $250 that may signal a bank run and collapse the price. They may try this at open on Monday.

**Important price 2: $300**They fought hard to not allow this important milestone to be reached on Friday. If it hits $300 it goes to $350.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4rgccnyn3um61.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=8487b0763e4dc397a96a34c0248c726aea469b43

**Important price 3: $340.20**This was their LAST ATTACK and many people will anticipate it again, which may mean a small push will re-create a self-fulfilling prophecy.

**Important price 4: $350**Hitting $350 signals HUGE confidence to the price and it will keep going to $400.

**Important price 5: $400**

At this point MOST buyers are in the money at a profit and you will start to see some profit taking. This may co-incide with a Short Attack to make it look like people are cashing in.

**Important price 6: $483 - THE ALL TIME HIGH**

As the all time high is approached many 'smart retards' will think to sell before other people start selling. Everyone is seeing that goal line and it may create more selling pressure as we reach that peak. There will also be less retail buying at these levels since who wants to buy at the peak. The only buyers will be the shorts covering which would just keep pushing the price up IF they get called and or are covering.

\*\*TLDR:\*\*There are at least 6 important price milestones at which shorts may attack next week and DUMP a lot of shares for sale in a short period of time. DO NOT PANIC... It's what they want. Be prepared for the psychological games they will play. Remember NO SANE INVESTOR dumps shares at a loss or less of a profit...

Have a GREAT weekend!

**TLDR UPDATE: FAWCK I FORGOT ABOUT $420.69! LOTS OF IDIOTS WILL SELL HERE TOO**

It's because prices usually have a resistance such as these where a lot of people normally set sell orders. So usually you would find some sort of resistance at like a 300 and a 350 etc. But if it breaks through that and holds a bit, theres normally very little resistance until the next small milestone"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,If i was HF in trouble would it not be smarter to cover my shorts now driving the price to the moon and then have massive puts at the levels you mentioned? I mean give the apes their paper bananas and bank on diamond hands?

No there isn't, and you picked the complicated explanation rather than the simple one.  Millions of shares of GME are currently held by people that have no idea what they're doing.  They're here for GME and nothing else.  I don't doubt there's coordination and such going on, but everyone is here for GME to go up so they can take profits.  It went up, they took profits. It went down, others panic sold because they're new... we start again.  This shit with everything being some high level conspiracy is getting tired."

Sure fuck the hf but im not gonna hold a bag and lose thousands for a meme or a metaphorical message that wont be heard or seen. The hf dont care about us sticking it to them they dont think twice about us at night and when this is over theyll continue on no matter how much we take.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was a very wel coordinated and massive attack. Somebody spent $4.5mm on $200 strike puts l, which was way out the money at the time - shares were >300 and gaining, why piss that much away, so far out the money? 35 minutes later those two, massive drops came in the dump of short selling. It was likely an extremely expensive move. But those $200 puts quickly went in the money. Any longs who set stop losses up between those levels automatically sold their shares, feeding into this. Then MM‚Äôs sold shares as part of their hedging, as tens of thousands of calls went out the money and tens of thousands of puts went in the money.

It was truly an amazing move. The only thing more amazing was the bounce that broke that momentum and shot it back up into that 250 range. Either two very very well capitalized funds landed massive blows against each other or one massive fund is playing both sides and eating longs and shorts alike."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with OPs sentiment and yours. With all the great DD and the last crazy attack to drop the stock from ~$350 to ~$170, yet when the day ended green at $260 should tell everyone what they need. Retail is swimming with the whales/institutions that are out for HF blood. They play dirty so they must have a lot to hide. March will either bankrupted them or apes will continue to hold.

At this point he's set for life, he's great for morale but everybody still should think about what risks they're willing to take, and what their goals are, he has already won and everything is just gravy for him at this point."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean they will but you need 80-100% to cover the purchase. I dipped like 9k into margin because I had unsettled funds and my broker margin called me.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Retail changed the game. The whales now have a group who is willing to sit and hold for indeterminate time as long as it trends upwards. So they can make a killing letting it rise a bit then selling down as long as every day ends green so we don't freak out and sell.

OP for this post talking about how he sees it being fairly valued at $500, *that* makes sense to me. I mean to be fair I also wouldn‚Äôt exactly be shocked if it stabilized at 150, but 500 seems like it‚Äôs within the realm of possibility. Can you explain to me (or anyone else who sees the stock reaching 10k or above) what makes you think that‚Äôs a reasonable valuation? 

Not trying to be a dick or rain on anyone‚Äôs parade, I‚Äôm honestly just confused"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well for one, it was already confirmed in the news by Cpt D-Bag himself, that GME was extremely close to rocketing into the thousands before they froze buying, to ""stop the hemorrhaging"", I believe was the terminology. So we know it was going into the thousands, and still has the potential to do so. The height of those thousands is debatable. Some say a few thousand. Some say this is so unprecedented it has the potential to go off the charts. No one truly knows, but that is what everyone is here to find out. Everyone has to make their own choice. Cash out at some point and lose potentially life changing money, or hold to long because it never reached that peak and lose out on some great gains. Maybe it never happens at all. Maybe it happens and it's so big and convoluted with bankruptcy and fraud that things don't work out how everyone intended. Maybe just maybe, the people who hold the longest become wildly retarded rich...No one knows. I think there will be a fair mixture of people selling some to cover cost and some profits, while holding some, and praying to their wife's boyfriend that we make it to the moon. Maybe one dude in Nebraska that sells a single share for a million dollars? And one Asian that sells everything at peak, but triples down on the dip and looses it all.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm with you I want to hold to the moon as much as everyone else. I'm not trying to fud or shill or make anyone think of selling early. I'm just trying to be realistic since more and more people are spamming 500k is not a meme and stuff. It could truly fly to 100k or more the math and facts are there. The real question is will people be capable of waiting till then. Sure we all can say we will but when you start seeing 5fig gains I think it becomes a lot harder. I'm up 5k right now and I could absolve my debt right now but I hold. I just don't want people to end up bag holding because of hype I guess is what I'm getting at. Maybe my 1k is unlikely is the problem it could easily pass that but beyond is where I get doubtful

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"People who speak about the price getting to $10k are talking about it spiking up to that price (or further) during the squeeze. Not that it is realistically worth that much.

Did you just stumble into this sub for the first time and this was the very first thread you came across?

Valuation has nothing to do with what we're trying to achieve.

It has everything to do with fucking the HFs and your mother."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Reasonable valuation and possible valuations are different
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The whole point of this is that it doesn't make any sense.  It's not about what GME is fairly priced, it's about how high the price will go because short positions are REQUIRED to buy stocks at the market price to cover their position. It also doesn't solely depend on us apes to hold our stocks. It mostly depends on how much other whales and HFs hate the HFs that have short positions. If the short positions have to buy ~22mil shares then the places with millions of shares can slowly sell them at increasing prices that the shorts are REQUIRED to buy at.

Then again, I'm a retarded ape and this is not financial advice."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt listen to this fucking idiot. I‚Äôm holding GME but some of these people are so lost in their own delusions of the world and condescending Reddit posts it‚Äôs mind blowing. I‚Äôll hold until it squeezes and then I‚Äôll shudder at the idea of someone telling me they stick a banana in their ass for fun for the rest of my life. 

They‚Äôre all fair points that should be answered with more than muh Volkswagen squeeze."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,">I understand it pretty well now

Lol. Sure. Whatever makes you feel better"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,They can say something is overvalued all they want... the stock price is the stock price. You don‚Äôt hear anyone getting out of Tesla even though it‚Äôs ‚Äúovervalued‚Äù lol. In fact I would think it‚Äôs a GREAT argument for GameStop and the market gives e-commerce MUCH higher evaluations than retail. GameStop is literally moving from retail to e-commerce. But believe what you want I‚Äôm here to make money and I like the stock

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now sell at least 75% of that just in case the market crashes due to higher interest rates on bonds, giving you money to buy back in on the dip and turn that 14 million into 100 million."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,14 millimeters worth of dollars?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I had this amount of money, I'd spread it all around among dividend stocks and retire to live off dividends. Probably take a Million off the top to play around with and buy a house/nice car and some other toys."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs it like to have 100% of your portfolio as GME?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why do people say ""mm"" instead of ""m""?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,That sure could adopt a lot of Apes.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you adopt a gorilla tho?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"How do unfollow your advice retard? Do you post your moves? Show me the way to financial success 

Obligation to fuck you.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd love to hear how you plan to spend some of your fortune. Any purchases you're thinking about? Also have you told family / friends? How have they reacted? Well played stranger!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,How many gorillas have you adopted?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok bro, spill the beans, both small Aero companies. What did you know?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm kind of new and really trying to learn I see all these option positions but they all expire in April of this year are these the only purchases he ever made or did he buy shorter term calls back in 2019 and 2020 and did maybe he buy some leaps  that went up and then maybe he sold all those and bought new positions?  These can‚Äôt just be one big purchase back on 2019 and then wait correct?

Please explain (How much was purchased, when it was purchased, if anything was sold along the line, etc) if you can I appreciate it so I can learn how to do this myself"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,14 millimeters in 1 year? nice cock bro
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck you
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Now all you have to do is adopt a gorilla you piece of degenerate sheet.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sell all and invest n GME and AMC to the moon.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats and fuck u. Now go buy some apes you retard
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You better buy many many apes with those tendies!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats! Hoping to hit over a mil in a year by the end of next week.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I have $20? Thanks üòä
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You can get billions even trillions with 100k. But what man can afford to save 100k like what job(s) do you have???
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm more impressed they held after getting whipped from June to august where the 7MIL became 3MIL in two months. 
True autist.  Held and then it came back.  This guy should go preach to any GME paper hands left"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotta have money to make money

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,cute paper trading pics.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Ayo can I have 1k to dump on GME?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,But how many apes did you adopt?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"How to make a million dollars:
Step 1: Get a million dollars..."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"2k bet on GME turned to 250k in Jan.

Then turn that 250k in 20mil in March on the second squeeze!

Now to wait for the 3rd and 4th and 5th squeeze!!

Now go get em tiger!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Start with $500, keep making all the right bets, then you have $125,000"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just scale it up. Start with 1250, maybe next year you will have 150k?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"14000000/125000 = 112.

If you have 1000, you can make 112000, which is close to 125k, so what are you waiting for?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,EXACTLYYYYY
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Not that hard turned 8k into 36k then settled for 25k lol take profit when it's not gme lol Yolo's is fun
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just got my first bonus, $50k. Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooorely tempted to invest, but I'm a crayon-eating ape and I'd probably get a better return hunting through vending machines for change."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Pro-tip. Dont have parents that do meth. Having money isnt easy when your PTSD ruins employment and nobody takes you seriously.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy GME at $1,000 and sell at $1"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol right
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you checked the couch cushions
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs easy all you gotta do is live for free  forage your own food never buy anything and work a 9-5 job 40 hours a week @10$ an hour for 6 years and after inflation you‚Äôll have a whopping 134k!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I built this empire on nothing, started from nothing. That plus the 125k.."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I got a loan and cash advances for my seed capital
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You just need to have a bunch of kids.  The government is giving $1400 per fuck trophy.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"14000000/125000 = 112.

If you have 1000, you can make 112000, which is close to 125k, so what are you waiting for?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"He more than 100x his initial investment.

So use one year to get to 125k with \~1k starting money.

and another year to get to $14 million.

It is just one more step /s"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Easy give me 250k and a month, I will easily return to you 125k."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have the $125,000.  Tell me how to do this and I‚Äôll give you 1/2 of all our gains"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,penny stocks are the way to go.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah you‚Äôre never going to become a billionaire if you‚Äôre a pussy
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"140? More like 400,000 people."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,And this is how we will all become slaves when the billionaires/trillionaires rule the world.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish I knew Jesus' secrets too... This guy's secret, he killed three hedgies behind a Wendy's dumpster in 1979."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Photoshop
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Best way to start with 20 million by holding from 14 million is going back in future
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,And make sure they expire in no more than 2 days.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm calling puts and putting calls. Mixin it up. Keepin it fresh.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"A lot of people on wsb made incredible amounts of money going short during the March 2020 drop. If I look at my chart, the biggest gains were during that time. I never sold my long positions, but my hedges were far outpacing my losses on my long portfolio.

So if he hedged, he didn't have to have any losses."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Tax??
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,There are no rich people on r/rich. Lol
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"He bought GME at $8 and sold at $15 according to his post history.

I believe he also made $100k doing a 5 minute call option the day of the big spike in January. 

He made money, obviously, but he missed out on the big money because he sells early. Probably why he's worth $14M now. He's happy with 100% return... unlike me who's sitting on 600% return on GME and still has a chance to lose it lol.

After those two instances he got extremely bearish on GME almost to the point that I think he feels like he missed out."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Market maker
Monkey magnet
Moral majesty
Maggot manifold
Manuscript migraine
Mountain mandolin"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,And he doesn‚Äôt seem like the kind of person to help others if it inconveniences him in any substantive way lol
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"i saw ur reply but it only shows up on ur comment history for some reason

listen, this has nothing to do with ur iq and everything to do with noticing certain market trends, and accurately predicting what value a certain number will be in a couple weeks/months/years. u just need to get econ fundamentals down (study for a couple weeks/months, familiarize urself with market concepts) and analyze trends that u see via ur own research or by others on this sub. that's all there is to it; it's very straightforward process but it takes time and effort"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,bruh all u gotta do is put in the time to study stocks and economics
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Risk of losing only (or close to) 100% of your money 99.999% of time
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"For calls, you cap out at 100% loss."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs obviously not an ape
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doesn‚Äôt matter everyone can‚Äôt do that shit and that fast, he could have easily lost all that too."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Then get at least the same % returns lul
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I go 10k to 125k I have guts to gamble it. If it's my retirement account that I've worked a long time to save 125k, I don't have the guts to gamble. Granted it's no difference, it is in my head."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,if you are an eternal optimist its easy because you wont see it as gambling
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Rightfully so. For every one winner like this guy there‚Äôs 50 apes who lose it all.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think that's the opposite,  you have too much money and start to gamble it way."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh hell yeah I just see it as a number of coins that isn't mine to begin with. I mean it technically wasn't, so idc. I have good odds for a good future so idc about investing 700 euros. It just gives me a kick. Money is just a funny number for me"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair I count any deposits as my ‚Äòstarting 
funds‚Äô. So if I deposit x number from my bank account I add it to my ‚Äòstarting‚Äô so I‚Äôm not lying to myself as to my gains/losses."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I never believe these unless verified. I feel like there should be a blanket rule for like 50x gains (maybe 5 figures too) that it needs to be verified first
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah and he's claiming 112x growth yet his gains only showing 2-3x; granted maybe hes flipping positions, but would like to know what made the bulk of the gains at 11,200%"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm almost at step one. Need about another 12% before I‚Äôm at 125 from 1k. Took about 1.5 years though.

Can‚Äôt wait for step two."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You snooze you lose.  I liberated my 401k funds last year via CARES.  Shit feels great to not have all my money trapped.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I actually feel pretty underpaid for what I do.  I should really work on fixing that.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,If this was true I‚Äôd have been a millionaire a year ago. Still not a millionaire.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Survivorship bias
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm fine with it as long as I get my hookers and coke. 

I am a simple man."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who knows, he is clearly active answering/replying but skipped over this whole discussion portion for a reason."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Checked the timing as well. At this point you could buy anything as it would be green now.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I actually posted pictures and a summary. But apparently only the pics posted. My big jump early on was a yolo in ostk $35 calls. Shortly after buying them it jumped to $80 and then $100. I then made a big error holding CHWY calls after I actually correctly estimated their earnings in October based on web traffic. I didn't anticipate the market wouldn't reward their earnings and dropped down to something like 3mm. That hurt real fucking bad. Then I started playing the reopening trade in November and yoloed into aer spr and some big banks.

Otherwise, no wealth tends to breed wealth with smart investing.

Hell can even make large sums even if you use options--just devote a smaller portion of the 125 to that play."

Basically, MMs hedges like to remain delta neutral, but they don't just buy shares to do it, they also match calls to puts. Now imagine on Wednesday right when the price was $340, someone bought a truly massive amount of $200 puts. Well now the MM doesn't have to sit on so many shares. So they sell them. Pretty much in an instant. Hello crazy dip! But those puts are still there for this upcoming week

Typically, the stock price gravitates to whatever value loses MMs the least amount of money. Or in other words, what inflicts the [Max Pain](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp) on market traders. As it currently stands, that's $200 for the upcoming EOW. However, once they are neutralized things are balanced all the way until the battle at $350. Which also means, every $200 call is pretty much promised to make $5k profit on an $8k play. Not big gains, but safe gains for a whale. And consistent safe gains are how whales stay whales. But they already knew that and we are just along for the ride."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not at all. Posters on this site want to see your loss and gain porn no matter what you have going in. 

The only rule is making a post with modest or small gains. That is generally not allowed and will be removed because, well, if you got a couple hundred dollars on a trade that's not that big of a deal. It'll clog up the subreddit. 

Anyway, context is sometimes required for these kinds of posts. This discussion thread here mentions that OP had $125K to start with for his investments. So the context was that he already was pretty well off, and then made a cool million plus for his investments. 

And so we are discussing, at least in this part, that we would first need $125k to figure out how to make that million. 

Next dude is suggesting that there's no way that this guy would dream to gamble $125K on calls even if he had that kind of money.

And my point was to argue that if I had that kind of money, even with my smooth brain, I could make decent money off my investments.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure but again, like you said, time frame.

Yes most retirement accounts reach 1 mil+ but not everyone's gets there at the same time and not everyone hits the 1 mil overall networth at the same time.

Even if he used all of that 125k on traditional investing he would absolutely be there much faster than someone his age starting with 25k using the same traditional method. Not to mention that he can likely afford to use portions of that wealth on riskier high risk high reward gambles moreso than the guy with 25k ever could. The comparison gets even worse when you compare someone with 125k to someone who can only contribute a couple grand a year into money markets with the rest going into expenses.

Again, wealth breeds wealth and the people in this world with more of it will have more opportunities to available to them to grow their wealth.

Sucks but it's true and it's utter coping to pretend that people with 6 figures networth esp at younger ages don't have innate advantages to wealth building or to pretend that most people with wealth lose it in money markets--most don't, just the dumb ones with gambling addictions do."

2021-03-13 20:48:35,wallstreetbets,"The DKNG Legislative Gamble For those in DKNG, there are potentially momentous events coming up in the next few months as state legislative sessions are coming to a close from now through about June. This could explain why there is a lot of unusual option activity around August at the 90c. 

The states in play and their progress on passing sports gambling either retail or mobile:

Texas: Two lawmakers filed legislation this week that would legalize casinos and sports betting in Texas. HJR133 was filed in the House on Tuesday and SJR49 filed in the Senate. The Texas Governor has also voiced support for the bill as well as the Sports Betting Alliance, which represents teams like the Dallas Mavericks, the Dallas Cowboys, and the Rangers. The Sports Betting Alliance has showed favoritism towards online sports betting too. This bill is supported between the two parties and the legislative session runs to the end of May. 

Florida: Legislative sessions are in progress and run to April 30th. The key part of negotiations is the Seminole Tribe of Florida. They offer a heavy endorsement as they run all casinos in the state of Florida. If they‚Äôre brought to the table in support of this bill soon, we could see some real pressure as the Governor is open to legalizing sports betting too. Though, as it stands, it doesn‚Äôt seem likely in this session. 

Arizona: Session ends on May 28th. Bill passed the House but faces political scrutiny in the Senate. Governor supports the legislation but its chance could end up grim if it gets stalled because of another bill trying to get horse racing on the ballot.

Maryland: Session ends in early-mid April (I think the 12th) Hogan is basically ready to sign this thing. It includes online sports betting too. This one practically a done deal.

South Dakota: March 29th marks the end of the session. The bill in this state easily cleared both the Senate and House. Governor is expected to sign off. 

Kansas: Session ends May 30th. The bill passed the Senate but its now in the House. Lawmakers in Kansas largely support the bill but there appears to be disagreements for who gets the gambling licenses. The Senate bill included 11 or 12 online gambling licenses, of which DKNG is included (of course).

DKNG could have a great year if some of these go through and could have an explosive one if they all do. The pandemic took a toll on these states and they need as much taxes as they can get. Sports betting is one way they can do that and it has bipartisan support across the aisle.

2021-03-13 20:27:27,wallstreetbets,"The incredible story being forged in the battle for $GME This past week was incredible .... of course that‚Äôs on top of an already incredible story. 

DFV, Ryan Cohen, and many a smooth brained ape started this fight quite some time ago. Many doubted, but the momentum built and built until the huge spike at the end of January 2021. 

This first clash brought apes seeking opportunity, valuing GME, and of course those seeking to exploit the greedy HF‚Äôs who had overextended. As GME soared, new apes were drawn in. 

Then Melvin, citadel, RH, and other market manipulators did what they always do. Cheated. 

GME was soaring and apes were on their way to the moon. We all had our reasons for jumping in and why not?  Is it wrong to seek opportunity? Is retail not good enough to play the same game?

Apparently in the HF‚Äôs opinion we are all crayon eating bastards, it‚Äôs their game, and it only works if they make money. So they cheated, plummeted GME, and many apes were left floating in space. 

They didn‚Äôt care. They blamed retail. 

‚ÄúKnow what you‚Äôre investing in‚Äù 
‚ÄúMeme stocks are volatile‚Äù
Distractions from where the real risk came from. Playing in a corrupt market with the facade of rules and structure. 

Sorry, but you can‚Äôt blame the apes who got left out there WHEN YOU CHANGED THE GAME! Trading halts that still allowed sells? What did you think would happen? If I‚Äôm an expert chess player and in the middle of the match the rules on how even a single piece can move are changed it puts me at risk! If I‚Äôm a retard, which i am, that just makes you even more pathetic that you can‚Äôt just play fair and beat me. 

There are many different apes in the GameStop game. Some of us have done years of research, DD, and like the stock. Others just came for tendies. 

Vlad called the initial swell a, ‚ÄúBlack Swan Event‚Äù. Highly unlikely. 

Well Vlad, the Black Swan has returned. GameStop is again soaring. Over the past month it‚Äôs up 427%. And despite attempts to drive the price back down THE LINE HOLDS. 

This past week we saw some big moves. The battle intensified until Thursday and Friday where we fought to a standstill. Many apes were discouraged that the MOASS didn‚Äôt happen yesterday, myself included. Victory was within grasp. Pluto in our sights. But we are still in the trenches. 

But let‚Äôs not forget that GME is up 427% and holding! This is huge! We are making progress in a fight that was stacked heavily against us and we are holding!

Now stimmy‚Äôs are on the way. Hulu releases ‚ÄúGame Stopped‚Äù documentary this Monday. HF‚Äôs are bleeding money. 

This isn‚Äôt going to be easy and hasn‚Äôt been. But reinforcements are on the way. The HF‚Äôs are bleeding and all I have to do is HODL! I‚Äôm ready to got to Pluto and then some.  

I like the stock. I‚Äôm gonna build a house on it and stay here a while. Maybe forever. Doesn‚Äôt matter because that‚Äôs my smooth brained choice and the HF‚Äôs don‚Äôt get to tell me different. 

There‚Äôs a lot of dates being thrown around out there and maybe one of them is right. Doesn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôll be there when it happens cause I LIKE THE STOCK. 

NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. IM RETARDED AND BRAIN WASHED. 

TL;DR 

I LIKE THE STOCK. VLAD SAID GME WAS ONE TIME EVENT. HERE WE ARE 1 MONTH LATER STILL UP 427%.  DFV IS NOT A CAT. NEW APES & STIMMY‚ÄôS INBOUND. I CAN STAY RETARDED LONGER THAN YOU CAN STAY SOLVENT!

2021-03-13 19:56:05,wallstreetbets,"I teach high school, which means I explain things to idiots every day. If you still don't understand call options, I got you. I see a lot of people asking basic questions about calls on just about every thread that mentions them. So here you go.

Note: before the finance majors come out and nitpick small things, remember that this is a basic primer for idiots; some of it has been simplified.

WHAT IS A CALL OPTION: BASICS

A call option (hereafter referred to simply as a ""call"") is a contract that gives you the ability, though not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of a stock for a specific price by a specific date, called the expiration date. Example: You buy a $400 call for GME that expires on March 19th. What that means is that at any time between now and end-of-day on 3/19, you can buy 100 shares of GME for $400. If the price spikes to $700 dollars, you can still buy them for $400. That's a pretty good deal.

So I need the price of GME to get to $400 to break even, and anything above that is profit, right? Not quite. You have to pay a premium for the option, which is the amount of money you're giving to the option seller in exchange for the contract. The premium is listed as the price per share, so if the option has a $2 premium, that means that you have to pay $2 per share of GME in the contract, which means that you pay $200 the buy the call ($2/share x 100 shares). You give the seller $200, and they give you the call option. Since you paid $200 for the option, this means that your break even price is $402 dollars per share. Why? Because if the price only got to $400, you could have bought it for $400/share without buying the contract, which means the money you spend on the contract was a waste. However, if the price goes to $403/share, then you make a profit, because you effectively paid $402/share for a stock worth $403/share.

But what if the price doesn't go up, or even goes down? Do I have to still buy those shares for $400? No. You never have to buy the shares if you don't want to. Remember, a call gives you the ability to buy shares for $400, but not the obligation.

But what if the price of GME goes way up but I don't have $40,000 around to buy 100 shares at $400/share? Then you sell the contract to someone who either does have $40,000 sitting around, or (slightly advanced info here that you don't need to know) to someone who is trying to offset a position. Regardless of who buys it, they will pay you a lot of money for your option because it is ITM, or in the money. What does that mean? Let's look at some option vocabulary.

CALL OPTION VOCABULARY

Strike Price: This is the price that you are allowed to pay for the stock per the contract. In our $400 call option above, the strike price is $400. At any time before the expiration date, you are allowed to exercise the contract the contract and pay $400/share for the stock.

Exercise: Exercising an option means you are exercising your ability to buy the 100 shares of stock. In the example above, you would spend $40,000 for 100 shares of stock regardless of the stock's price at the time. Can I exercise and only buy 20 shares of stock? No. If you can't afford to exercise, then you can sell your option to someone else.

Expiration Date: This is when your call expires. if you have a 3/19 expiration date, that means that your call option is no longer good after 3/19

Premium: The premium is the price you pay to the call-seller for the contract, and it is listed as the price per share. Knowing that, how much will it cost to buy an option with a premium of .25? If you do the math, it will cost you $25, which is .25/share x 100 shares.

ITM and OTM: ""In the Money,"" and ""Out of the Money."" ITM calls are calls for which the stock price has exceeded the strike price. If you have a $400 call, and the price of GME goes to $405, then your call is ITM because you can buy a $405 stock for $400. If you then immediately sold the stock for $405, you'd make money. OTM calls are calls for which the stock price is below the strike price. If you have a $400 call and the price of GME is $350, then your call is OTM. It is important to realize that being ITM doesn't mean being profitable. In the example above of the $400 call with a $2 premium, if GME goes to $401, you are ITM because 401>400, but you haven't broken even yet because your break-even price is $402.

FDs: FD is not an investment term, and you don't need to know what it means in order to understand calls. It is a WSB term, and it stands for maggot's delight (but with an F, because autmod won't let me define FDs). FDs are OTM calls with short expirations, and as such are a huge gamble. [The guy who spent 90k on 1dte \(1 ""day to expiration""\) OTM GME calls?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3r3v2/found_out_how_to_buy_call_options_yesterday/) Those were all FDs, and they all expired worthless. Why are they called FDs? Because when you buy FDs, you usually end up taking it in the ass.

WHEN PEOPLE LIST THEIR OPTION POSITIONS, THEY USE A BUNCH OF NUMBERS AND LETTERS THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. HOW DO I FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT

You have probably seen something like this: GME $400c 3/19. Let's break it down.

GME $400c 3/19 - The GME stands for Gamestop, which you probably figured out. The $400c is a call option with a strike price of $400. If it said $400p, it would be a put option, but we'll talk about those later. The 3/19 stands for the expiration date.

Now let's make it more complicated. If I said, ""I bought 10 $5 GME $800c 3/19,"" what do I mean?

It means that I bought ten contracts of GME $800 calls with a 3/19 expiration, and I paid $5 per share. If I paid $5 per share, how much did I spend on my contracts? I spent $5,000 ($5/share x 100 shares x 10 contracts).

Now you try it. A $700 call on GME that expires next week costs around seven bucks a share. How would you explain to me that you bought two of them?

You would say that you bought 2 $7 GME $700c 3/19. Now you can look like you know what you're talking about even though you still probably don't.

WHY DO PEOPLE BUY CALL OPTIONS?

This is confusing. Why do people even do this? People buy call options because you can make a lot of money. If you have the right to buy 100 shares of something for a fixed price, then for every $1 the share price goes above your break-even price, you make $100. If you have a $400c with a break even of $402, and the price gets to $412, then you make $1,000 profit. That's $10 of profit ($412-$402) times 100 shares. You can buy the shares and hold them, or you can buy them and sell them immediately to realize that profit. Or you can sell the contract to someone else and just take the money. It is usually better to sell the contract, but that's not an important distinction because most of you can't afford to exercise anyway, and will be selling contracts.

WHY ARE CALLS DANGEROUS?

When you buy a stock, at least you own the stock. If you buy an option and it expires worthless, then you have nothing. If the guy who bought 90k worth of FDs had bought 90k worth of GME and held, then he'd still have somewhere around 90k worth of GME, +/- 5% depending on when he bought on Thursday. Instead, he has nothing.

WHY DOES THE VALUE OF MY CALL KEEP CHANGING

So you bought a call option, and every time you look at it it's worth a different amount of money. That's because there are actually two types of value in an option: options have Intrinsic Value, and Extrinsic Value.

Intrinsic Value is the exercisable value of the option, If you own a $400c, and the price is $412, then the intrinsic value of the option is $12/share, or $1200, because that's the value you would get if you exercised it right now. as stock price goes up, intrinsic value goes up. Pretty easy.

Extrinsic Value has a more complicated definition, so we're going to call Extrinsic Value the potential the option has, and that potential is based on time and volatility. For example, if there is a long time before expiration, then that means that there is more potential for the option to go ITM, because more time = more chances for the price to rise. Therefore, options further from expiration will be worth more than options close to expiration. Conversely, less time to expiration = less value, which means that your option can constantly lose value as time goes on and the number of chances you have to go ITM decreases. This is called theta decay, but you don't need to worry about that.

Volatility is the second part of extrinsic value, and options for stocks that are more volatile can be worth more than options for stocks that trade steadily, because if a stock price swings wildly up and down, there's a greater chance that one of those upswings will put you ITM. This is reflected in a measurement called IV, or Implied Volatility. Like Theta Decay, IV is a more advanced concept that you don't need to understand now as long as you get the basics.

Due to the factors of time (theta) and volatility (IV) constantly changing, the extrinsic value of your option will also change over time. This is why the value of your option will constantly change. Is the stock calming down and starting to trade sideways (low volatility)? Your option value will decrease as IV drops. Is the stock starting to jump around? Your option value will increase as IV increases.

Sometimes the stock price can be climbing slowly but the value of your option can be decreasing. Why do you think that is? If the stock value is increasing slowly, but you're way OTM and running out of time because your option expires tomorrow, the downward price pressure of theta decay can overcome the upward price pressure of volatility and stock price rise, and your option value can decrease.

I BOUGHT A CALL AND I'M ITM! HOW/WHEN DO I SELL MY CONTRACTS

You can sell your contracts at any time. You don't have to wait until the expiration to sell your contracts. This is good, because if the price spikes, you can dump your options for profit and move on. There was a point yesterday when 90k FD guy's 275 and 285 calls were ITM when GME spiked to 290. If he had sold then, he wouldn't have lost everything by waiting until expiration.

I BOUGHT A CALL AND I'M ITM! HOW/WHEN DO I EXERCISE MY CONTRACTS

Make sure that you have enough money to cover buying all the shares and click the exercise button. They get your money, and you get their shares. This can take some time.

OK. I GET IT. BUT CAN YOU GIVE ME A TL:DR JUST IN CASE I ACTUALLY DON'T GET IT

A call option is a contract to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price. To buy the contract, you pay a premium to the contract seller. If the price of the stock goes above the price of your contract, you can either buy the shares or sell the contract for profit.

The End.

SO I'M AN EXPERT NOW AND CAN GO YOLO EVERYTHING ON CALLS AND MAKE MONEY?

No. You have a basic understanding of how calls work and know just enough to be dangerous. Don't go crazy. Buy a call. See how it works for real. Don't YOLO your life savings on your newfound knowledge. Or do. Live your life how you want; I'm not your dad. Just make sure you post the porn when you win or lose."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"u/The_Superbus hi! I appreciate how you made it easier for new traders to understand this as there had been a huge interest in the stock market for people since time had been unstable. You might just need to edit small stuff such as....

You said: ‚ÄúThis is called theta decay, but you don‚Äôt need to worry about that.‚Äù

Theta decay is very important for options as well as learning all the greeks, we shouldn't ignore it. It makes us understand which options would make us less liable to risk, understand what's eating our options when a play went south, why my option price is decreasing in value when the price didn't move, etc.

Thank you once again. And have a great great day"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,If  you work public school then i don‚Äôt trust you
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"2 things I think that are important to note in your fantastic explanation. 

1.) you can only lose the amount of money you spent on the contract. So if a contract has a premium of .25¬¢ per share, 100 shares x .25¬¢ = $25. $25 is how much the contract costs and is the ONLY money you can loose. I think it looks scary to a lot of people, because the share values look large, and large amounts of money is scary. So if you look at what the premium will cost, and you are ok with losing that, then go for it. Because you can‚Äôt loose any more than that but your potential profit is technically infinite. 

2.) it‚Äôs also important to note that you will almost always sell the contract for your profit. Very rare that you would actually exercise it, so don‚Äôt focus on buying and selling the stock. Focus on getting ITM and selling the contract to some other poor sap."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,">Make sure that you have enough money to cover buying all the shares and click the exercise button. They get your money, and you get their shares. **This can take some time.**

Can you elaborate on that last part? I've been hearing that it can take as much as two days (standard settlement time) to get the stocks. That seems like a BIG DEAL if you're trying to time a spike for a volatile stock. For example, if I'd exercised on RKT while it was in the 40s I'd think I'd scored... except by the time I actually received the stock to sell it'd be way back to the 20s where I bought it. That delay could be excruciating."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"But then why not just buy the lowest ITM strike price where the break even price is lower than the current stock price and sell at current stock price? If stock price is $50 and buying the lowest ITM strike price has a break even price of $49.75, selling it for current stock price will give you .25 of profit per share, right? For someone with a lot of money they can just buy, sell, rinse and repeat. Obviously I am wrong, can someone explain?"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm new to anything past buying standard market price shares and I‚Äôd like to ask a few things for clarity:

$XYZ stock is currently worth $10/share.

1) At this moment, I could buy a call option for the current price ($10/share) with say 100 shares expiring a month from today, meaning the total price out of my pocket for this call is $1000 + premium/share. If the price of $XYZ rapidly increases to say $70 per share, I can execute my call and obtain 100 shares of $XYZ at $70/share while only paying $1000 + premium/share?

2) (not sure if this varies between trading platforms, but just in case, I use E*TRADE)...  if I place said call option on $XYZ right now, is that money withdrawn from my account to hold the contract until I decide to execute it or scrap it?

3) Just to clarify... if I have said call option and instead of rising, $XYZ drops to less than a dollar... I can just scrap the call option and forget it ever happened, keeping all $1000 +premium/share of my money?

4) If I decide not to execute my call, do I still have to pay the premium?

Thank you for such an elaborate explanation, I hope these questions will help clear things up for others as well. I understood pretty much everything as it was explained perfectly, but I need this clarification just because doing this seems almost too good to be true lol. Thank you!"

Why is it better to sell the option rather than excise it if you have the money? I understand if it is a long time from expiration it can be more profitable due to the time value but say it is expiring that day, why would you sell rather than excise?"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This was amazing, thanks so much OP! Definitely understanding way more now than I ever have. A few follow-up questions I don‚Äôt see covered elsewhere in the comments:  

1. Why is it typically better to sell your contract than to exercise? Is that because if you sell the contract at the right time, you‚Äôre locking in a return (and maybe even getting extra if the stock is increasing and people are paying you under the assumption it will keep increasing)?  
  
2. Who are the people buying these ITM calls? Is it more advantageous/profitable to buy an ITM call than buying a stock? 
  
3. Related to the above, why do people buy ‚Äúdeep ITM calls‚Äù vs just buying the stock?
  
4. Is there a rule of thumb for what makes a call good value vs not? Do you look at IV and only buy if it‚Äôs at X? If for example you feel great that a stock will go to $70, maybe you would be willing to buy a call at a $2 premium but not a $10 one?

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"So what happens if your option ends up ITM but you didn't break even?

This happened to me with amc and BB

I hit my strike price just barely and RH attempted to sell some of my contracts. My call was exercised automatically since I was ITM but then I ended up getting margin called cause of this. I had the funds for it since I was on margin but what would happen if I didn't have they money?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a question, if you bought 100k contracts for GME with strike price of 800 expiring on 3/19. So, that‚Äôs for a total of 10M shares. If the stock price ends up at 799 just before expiry. Do you have the option to exercise the contract? 

Reason being is you can get a fixed price of 800 vs trying to buy 10M shares in the market the day after which would likely push the average price up over 800."

Can you pls explain how the 90K guy lost 90K? With what I learned I don't see him spent 90K. I see the following.

10 * 0.03 * 100+

But you definitely want to study Theta Decay and Implied Volatility. Those two motherfuckers will come out of nowhere and snatch the gold medal right out of your simian hand if you aren't careful.

I understand the basics of calls, but have never done any.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"> A call option (hereafter referred to simply as a ""call"") is a contract that gives you the ability, though not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of a stock for a specific price by a specific date, called the expiration date. 

Wrong, wrong, wrong, god awfully wrong. 

Let‚Äôs say you are new to investing and you are playing expiration day contracts and the market starts going down. You freak out and decide you hate the rigged stock market logging out of your account and calling it quits. It‚Äôs Friday so you‚Äôll enjoy your weekend and forget all about those useless expiring contracts you bought. You aren‚Äôt obligated to buy the shares, right?  Right?!?!?

You wake up Monday to your broker ringing your phone off the hook because those non-obligatory calls you had obligatorily exercised ITM because the stock market changed its mind and ran its balls off after you logged out. They were $.05 in the money were obligatorily exercised without your consent causing you to buy a boatload of shares on Friday.

Now it‚Äôs Monday and as you expect the stock market is upside down and your broker wants to know where the hell their money is at since they so kindly exercised your contacts without your knowledge. 

I can spot a fraud a mile away. I wouldn‚Äôt trust any yahoo that says you have the right but not the obligation to buy shares. BS!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I love you.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok but if I'd rather sell the contracts because I don't have the cash to execute how do I sell the contracts?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,How do I know if a premium is way overpriced or if it's priced too low? Do different brokers have different prices? If I buy an option I basically have to watch it all day right?

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,So why wouldn‚Äôt you just buy an option with a strike price of one dollar higher than the current price? Then you‚Äôll be ITM if it goes up just slightly and you could sell for a profit. I‚Äôm obviously missing something.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I think I might have a super smooth brain because I only understood 70% of it.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape thinks caesar ape needs a sticky.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,So why don‚Äôt I just use the limit option to buy a stock at X price? When it hits that price I pay the stocks then automatically. There‚Äôs no need to pay anyone for the option.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape like AMC calls.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,So what answers should I give to my broker when applying for options approval? Ha
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm sitting here reading this and I'm thinking someone with deep pockets could artificially increase the extrinsic value of a call by teaming up with someone else who has deep pockets and just take turns buying and dumping large percentages of a stock.

Or is this not possible?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for this, it makes a lot more sense vs. other resources.

I feel like this, along with other stock trading ""things"" shouldn't be a thing.

I think the limit of stock trading should be, ""buy a share in a company if you think it has potential.""  Other things, speculations, derivatives, etc, just seems like systematic manipulations designed to exclude populations from playing the game."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You fucked it up right at the start: you can buy 100 shares for $400. EACH. $400 EACH is fuckloads more than $400. 100x actually.

Where did the number **100** (shares) come from?"

Great write up."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Late to the party but I'll ask my question anyway. 
Why are these for want of a better phrase 'side bets' even a thing?
Not in a GME way but in a generic stock market as a whole way.
I find the calls and puts and shorts and longs as just a crock of shite made up for hedge funds etc to just gamble more money.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You lost me at ‚Äúhereafter‚Äú. What does that mean?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you really want to exercise the option but can't afford to buy 100 shares, there might be another option.

1. Try selling the option anyway. Be patient, it might work.

Sometimes, especially for far ITM options, it can get difficult to sell because no one is paying attention - maybe very few people want to buy it, but it's still ITM. If you can't sell it but it would be profitable to exercise it...

2. Call your broker. Especially if you use a real brokerage (not Robinhood ...), they might agree to help you out by exercising the option and immediately selling the shares. Effectively they're loaning you the extra money for the 30 seconds it takes them to sell the stock and return you any profit."

The gain porn on call (and occasionally put) options I see posted from time to time, is that obscene amount of profit typically from exercising the contracts or selling the contracts? And if it‚Äôs from simply from selling the contract(s), what would someone stand to gain from exercising them as opposed to just selling them to make a profit? To sum it up in a quicker manner what benefits would exercising a contract(s) have that selling wouldn‚Äôt? If it was just to make money it seems like selling would be the better choice, assuming someone was even in a position to exercise the contract to begin with. And from what I‚Äôm getting out of it the only time someone would choose to exercise would be to get shares at a lower price, or to purchase all shares tied to the contract being exercised simultaneously at a fixed rate? Again I‚Äôm a retard and I‚Äôm new to all of this so could someone break it down or explain that part of it a bit better?"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Dammit you animal! You fucking made me learn something.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,How does the option seller make money off this?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice work.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This ape is swimming in awards
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you so much!!!! Question: When exactly is a good opportunity to buy a call option? In other words, under what circumstances should one consider this... option?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"But the share price is 10, ape buy call for 5 am I ITM?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You said you'd get to puts later... But nothing.

WHAT ABOUT THE PUTS? ü¶ç"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is super helpful I still just never know how much it's actually going to cost me because of words like margin etc.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you that was very helpful! The only part I even half understood before your ""explain it to me like I was in high school"" post was the math. I understand rate of decay pretty well, but the whole contract to buy more money than my entire net worth was confusing. Seems I may have been making it more difficult than it really is and the huge amount of 0's had me scared and confused. Think that's some senior level shit that this freshman is gonna hold off on. Once I get 10k I'll reconsider options. For now.. Imma hodl and buy dips lol."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"One important bit you left out.  Why Calls?  It's about *leverage*.  You take the chunk of money you were going to buy shares with and buy calls instead.  If stock price raises, you have leveraged your money against the value of 100 shares instead of just a few."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for taking the time to write that. I thought I understood but this really helped me understand.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Saving this so that hopefully one day I'll be minimally retarded enough to read the whole thing.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You did a great job explaining options buddy. I‚Äôve been teaching myself and reading everything I can get my hands on...I encourage you to do an explanation of puts and then the greeks. You‚Äôll do a great job.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I... love you?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm a retard, had to Google some of the big words you used.

But, just so I understand, are calls always 100 shares?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good, but the only comment that I'd disagree with is: *People buy call options because you can make a lot of money.*

Kinda. The example given is showing two different stock prices and two different price jumps. People buy options because they don't have to buy the underlying, just the option premium. As a result, you can then buy more shares, which would result in more money.

A better example is to say you have $5000 to play with. You can outright buy stock 'a', which is trading at $100 per share. That means 50 shares. If the price goes up $1, you make $50. Alternatively, options are trading ATM for $25. You could potentially buy 200 at-the-money calls, and if that same $1 movement happens, you make $200."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This was an amazing discussion of options, part 1 !! Can't wait for OP to make moar!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You might have found your calling! Teach us some more, teach!"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Just learned in 15 minutes what Google searches couldn't explain for shit for several years.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,so you‚Äôre saying i should yolo all my money and buy a $400 gme call for next week... say no more
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Now explain the Greeks‚ÄºÔ∏è PleaseüôèüèΩ
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,DO NOT LET THIS ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO BUY GME ON OPTION. WE HOLD!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,what happens if a call expires ITM?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you exercise before expiration date if it's ITM? What if you do nothing at expiration?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Dad?

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks the people here made me believe i was buying bananas
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks bb
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this what wsb has come to?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would it make sense to buy $100 put options on GME with a 1 or even 2 year expiration date?

I expect the stock to come down to $50 - 75 in the coming year, so they'd be well ITM, plus they'd have plenty of time left on 'm to satisfy the theta gods, right?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is amazing i feel like this post alone gave me more knowledge than all other posts in the past month. 
Can you do more please?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"okay so in summary for buying a call option contract is that: I (the ape) agree to buy 100 shares of GME at $400 (agreed price) from you ( the guy selling me this contract) and im going to pay you $2.5 per share for agreeing to hodl this contract until March 19 2021.

 does this make sense? 

by the way what happens if i choose not to exercise the option after the expiry date? do i still have the chance to cash out my losses/gains?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,How come you need the cash to exercise when you are just going to turn around and sell them anyway? I thought that was the whole point to options... Gamble without the cash
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 8 hours

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great reading! Thanks Ape! My questions is, if my call option expires, no matter with what result (itm/otm/broke even) I loss premium money only?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,If only this explanation exist back in early January i might be my husband's boyfriend by now
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is great - I was getting bored on YouTube vids - you nailed it
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Back when I had less help with my portfolio I sold covered calls. Maybe OP would like to explain that logic as well. This was in my IRA account which has option restrictions to lessen the risk. Probably too dull a way of making money for this crowd.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, thanks. I read it all. I have only one question, what is a call?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Most retards won't get this. They'd just keep buying GME
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for this. I taught HS science then moved up to local Community College Computer Sci professor, simplifying the complex is an art. I used pokemon trading cards to explain to my twenty something how the scenario was set up. She loved her rare cards and trading.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there anyone who teaches pre school here that can teach me?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"There was alot of this I have already figured out but alot more info that I haven't and thank you for that OP, some ppl on WSB want to help ape. Others no want to help ape. Thank you being one of the good ones"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok so now that I vaguely understand them. Does anyone know what app to use to buy them in the UK? I've tried a bunch that don't even list GME because they're bitches.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,So do all TV remotes have these options because I can't find it on mine?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a question. Say you got a call and the price skyrockets but you can't afford it. How much would you be able to sell the contract for? Also, would it be possible to take some sort of bank loan to buy the stocks and then immediately sell them? Then you can just pay the loan back immediately and pocket the profit."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Nicely put together!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Are CFD's kind of the EU alternative to options?

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great explanation OP, you sound like an amazing teacher! I wish I had a teacher like you in high school. I hope you're teaching your students the basics about finances, taxes and all the other adulting crap that gets skipped in high school and college."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Very very informative thank youü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶ç
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is amazing. Thank you.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd never bought an option before.  The cheapest experiment I could do was pay $41 for those astronomically unlikely odds that we'd hit $800 on Friday.  I rationalized it to myself that some people buy $40+ of Powerball tickets with no chance of winning. $800 on Friday at least had a 1% chance.  üòÜ

And I came away from it seeing how the option works and watching it's value change throughout the day.  I learned something even with no chance of winning and at the end of the day it was only 41 bucks."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can I exercise an option and sell at market price at the same time to cover costs of purchase or do I HAVE to be able to but all 100 shares first.

If I can sell to cover the buy, can I sell only enough to cover or does it have to be all it nothing?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,!Remind me 3 days
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you so very very much for this explanation
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,And this ape still doesn't understand how that guy lost 90k. My math says he invested less than 1.5k
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn i think i love you
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you Mr. Lee Tard. I'm japanese btw
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone help with giving me an overview of SELLING calls? I have over 100 shares of a stock. How do holders use option contracts?

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Commenting to read later
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Amazing experience
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks man. I kind of understood calls but this make it a lot easier to understand.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey so if you buy a call option just above the current price on an upward trending stock and set it for a month or year away that‚Äôs a good idea ? Is it that easy all you would loose is the premium but you could gain a lot more right ? Ape figure this out now ?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,this was. very helpful lol
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks my dude
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Okay so how do I sell said contract once it's ITM if I don't have the cash to purchase it at the time?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is quality content right here. üëè
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"beautifully explained - OP evidently has vast experience with smooth brained apes.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I still can‚Äôt believe I read the whole thing twice. Thanks for the lesson.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I've spent hours watching shitty youtube videos by a bunch of assholes who can't explain it in a basic way.  Big props to you for breaking this down and explaining it simply.  You're a fucking genius amoung retards
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"RemindME! 2 Days ""When I am not so hungover and can read again"""
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,So I am trying to buy my first option but I don‚Äôt see the premium. Does it have other names? I see a bid price is that it?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Much like, very thanks"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, sounds too easy and deadly. Thanks brotha!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"OK so my question has to do with implied volatility, and is that good if I‚Äôm trying to day trade or swing trade stocks/options?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"See, I know all this. But what the fuck is a put? It's the ""right"" to sell 100 shares at a price, but why the fuck would anyone buy your shares over the cheaper shares?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Didn‚Äôt read, already know my Greeks.

That said. 

90% of the new people here will never play options. 

It‚Äôs probably better for them as individuals, but this sub was created explicitly for options plays. We used to tell people buying shares to go back to /r/investing.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I didn‚Äôt know why calls were so dangerous. People buy the contracts but can‚Äôt afford the shares. How retarded
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I know some of these words üòè
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I almost read three whole sentences before I started skipping around and reading the bits I wanted to read.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,But some have a short attention span and stop reading at the title üò∞
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Just finished my gf left me due to fd's and I'm still retarded
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Can confirm. Researched calls and felt I got it. Saw an options chain after and it was a whole other can of worms to learn.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I know Robinhood can eat a fat one.  What trading platform do 9 out of 10 apes agree is the best now?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Retarded question - How do you sell your contract to another buyer, versus exercising the contract?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why tho? If it's ITM and you have the funds to exercise, wouldn't it be more profit to do it?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there a Stock Market Simulator out there?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Found the new person trying to fit in...
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,All options that people buy have to have a seller. When you buy an option to purchase the stock at the strike at a later time there always has to be someone on the other end - the seller. You are both betting in opposite directions and if the buyer is right the option gets assigned to the seller to have to pay/give the 100 stock to the buyer. If the seller is right then the buy doesn‚Äôt get the stock and the premium they paid is gone forever.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let‚Äôs use an at the money option for an example which would be an option that is right at the stock price. An ATM option is entirely extrinsic value and the deeper ITM an option gets, the more closely the change in value of the option mirrors the change you would get by owning 100 shares.  You can buy a hell of a lot more options than shares of the underlying with a set amount of money."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes you can but you would be throwing away money. If I have an AAPL call with a $130 strike and it‚Äôs current price is $120 why the fuck would I buy 100 shares @ $130 per share. I‚Äôd be losing the difference between 130 and 120 multiplied by 100 so I‚Äôd lose $1000 not even including whatever price I paid for the contract

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm also learning but I can answer some of your questions:

1) Your out of pocket price for the call is only the premium of the share. Only if you excise will you have to pay the 10$ per share. So when you excise it you will pay only the 1000$ as you would have paid the premium before (when buying the call). This will get you 100 shares of the stock XYZ, then yes if current market is at 70$ your shares would be worth 70$ at that point but obviously you would have to sell them to get the profits.

2) Ties in with point 1) premium taken when you buy call but the price for buying the stock only if you excise.

3) You get to keep $1000 as you have not excised the option but you lose the premium if the call expires. Think of the premium as the 'buy' price of the call.

4) Yes, see above. The premium is the 'buy' price of the call so essentially you are not refunded that amount whether you excise or not.

Would love for somebody else to confirm everything I've said above is correct."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup! Most brokers have in their TOS that they will exercise on expiration if the option is ITM. You can usually call them BEFORE end of day of expiration to tell them not to but each one could have different policies. Read the fine print folks!

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think because he has to pay the premium, which is money he‚Äôs paying for no gain"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It doesn't factor in because they don't care if you have the money to exercise. If you don't have the money to exercise, you either sell it or let it expire and lose your premium."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"They shit on you because the whole point of this sub was options trading, so when 9 million people come here and more than half don't even know what what options are...."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, are you me?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm surprised that I actually understand most of this (after looking up spreads). Am I understanding this correctly in surmising that you haven‚Äôt lost on *any* of your recent trades? What brokerage are you using and how did you get your start? I‚Äôm interested in trying out options, but I‚Äôm hesitant to put $1k‚Äôs on the line just to learn the ropes."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"those options were nearly worthless because they were expiring that day. the only way they would make money is if gme would have suddenly jumped more than $500 in half an hour (not sure exactly when those ss were made), which is extremely unlikely, but not impossible, hence those low prices - nobody with a working brain would buy that option."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,All you need is Gil.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Etrade is no winner either. They let you log on once out of every fifty times and only if it  is 3am.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I understood most of that. In the example GME $800 calls, 3/19 expiration, $5 per share. 

You spent $5000 = 5 x 100 shares x 10 contracts. Where did the 100 share value come from? 

Similarly in the next example. I bought 2 $7 GME  $700c 3/19. But that doesn‚Äôt tell me how much I paid, coz it‚Äôs missing the number of shares value? Is it always 100?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It's so hard to find good write-ups here on Reddit so thank you very much! so basically a put option is the exact opposite?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Hell yes you did
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for posting this. Regarding the 90k guy, are you saying the premiums alone cost him 90k? I keep trying to do the math and don't see how the premiums are even close to that amount. I think I'm missing something."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Once you have it you go to the option and select sell. Same way you would a stock as far as interface goes.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"What about if you‚Äôre selling covered calls, if the stock price keeps going down, do you ever recommend ‚Äúbuy to close‚Äù?

But in reality it didn‚Äôt teach me much for the long term, because I never had real money in play.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm assuming that you mean that the call is OTM because the stock is below strike when it keeps going down.   In that case, you may want to buy to close if you think that there is a chance that the stock rebounds and you want to realize profits before it has a chance to go ITM  (ex: it drops during a correction and you think it's going to pick back up when the market rebounds).  Or maybe you just want out of the stock before it drops too far and you want to close your position before you sell your stock.  In either situation, buying to close makes sense."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep you've got it. You'd have to learn about the greeks to understand exactly all the things that go into the price being what it is but yes it can allow very high profits because a dollar in stock price movement can almost equal a 100 dollars in price of the option.

It seems like the only way to make anything when you're starting with little money is to buy options. But then the options that have more potential for profit are very expensive. My biggest fear is buying options that I can afford only for there to be not enough volume on them to sell when the premium shoots way up.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's really not a gimmick. It means digital artists can actually make money on their work now. Before, if you worked in a digital medium, if you shared your work online, there was no way to treat it like a piece of art the same way traditional artists do. If you work in 2D (like digital painting) you could sell prints, but there was no way to have an ""original."" An NFT allows for artists to certify an ""original"", or to create limited ""copies"" that are certified as coming from them.

The implications of this are massive. This opens up so many doors for all types of artists. What if you work in 3D and make animations? Now you can certify pieces of 3D animation as NFT art and treat it as such. Now a creator could potentially make money as an independent artist whereas before, someone who worked in 3D would likely only be able to find work in an animation or game studio somewhere. As to who would buy that, I mean, digital frames are more and more common now. Most people just use them to show pictures of their family. But if you were a collector of digital NFT art, you could fill your house with digital art if you wanted.

Or think about comic art. People pay premium for hand-drawn originals of comic pages by certain artists. People like to see the details of corrections the artist had to make, sketch marks, any blue lines that didn't show up in copying for print. Now take that concept to the digital realm. Before digital.comic artists couldn't do that. But with an NFT, digital comic artists could potentially certify their PSD files as NFTs and sell them. People would pay money to see how they organized their layer stacks, what blending modes they used, all the little tips and tricks to make a comic page look the way it does. It's artistic process, and yes, people do like to pay money for that, and artists like to make money.

Artists can't stop the internet from saving jpegs of their work for free. But NFTs will make it so much easier for artists to make money off their work more meaningfully. Now, a digital copy can be shown to have come from the creator themselves, in full resolution, as intended. And that does mean something if that's how you're trying to make a living."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup only the person holding the contract gets the difference in price from the strike at the original sellers expanse.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,It happens automatically once the contract gets completed. If need be the broker will margin the account of the seller who has to buy automatically if they don‚Äôt have the shares in their account. It‚Äôs pretty instant.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I used to only ever have around 300 or so at once to trade with and the biggest money maker for me has been options. Obviously I've lost a decent amount too but that's more because I didn't exactly understand what I was doing in the beginning and would hold on to some options too long when they were losing value everyday hoping it would rebound. 

You really don't have to worry about there being nobody to sell to by the way I have never once had that be an issue whatsoever.
You may not be able to sell exactly the price you want but I've never had an option that took more than 30 seconds to be filled even on slightly less popular stocks.  It shows you for each option what the current bid price and the current asking price is. Like if the ask is 300 and the bid is 290 it will show the price of the option as 295 but if you just set your price to 290 it will sell immediately. 

 Options that have had the premium shoot up a lot quickly will be even faster to sell because they are more likely to keep swinging up depending on how much time is left on the contract. So you really don't need to worry about that. FWIW Robinhood even tells you a rough estimate of the chance of the option ending up with profit by calculating the Greeks and the volatility. It's a decent measure to follow before you can decipher all the numbers yourself. 

But yeah once you've had a couple of options give you 400% returns in a couple days it can be hard to go back to just dealing with stocks lol."

If you have 100 shares, you could even turn a profit if the buyer exercises. Presumably if you‚Äôve got wits you‚Äôd have picked a strike price above your average share cost. So you‚Äôd collect premium at call sale + share profit.

But people who sell naked don‚Äôt have the shares to cover, so they have to buy at *current* price then turn around and sell all of them at the strike. So theoretically, the share price could go to infinity. Infinite loss, you‚Äôre fucked bub.

Edit: To answer plainly, yeah. People in general want those calls to expire out of the money. Many will buy them back for a smaller profit (or even a loss) before expiration to avoid getting assigned."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"A longer expiration date isn't ""better,"" it's just different. Here's an example:

Let's say you think airline stocks will return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021, but you don't expect them to grow after that. January 2022 calls will be cheaper than Jan 2023 calls, so you can buy more of them and make more money (if you're right) than if you bought the 2023 call. It may be ""safer"" to buy a longer expiration date call, since it will hold more value if you're wrong, but that doesn't necessarily make it ""better.""

Choosing the strike price and expiration date you want to buy (or sell) is a risk/reward tradeoff. There's no ""right"" answer unless you have insider information."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. I minored in law and it was the best decision. I‚Äôd love to go to law school some day, just to learn and protect myself. I study things as I can on my own, but would love the full education. I feel that any and all law classes will always benefit the student. Not only do you learn to be analytical, you learn the basic premise behind law and it really helps to protect yourself from someone fucking you over."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get what you mean. I was in catholic high school and maybe they washed my brain a bit too much and made me think that love is more important than it is. But I wouldn't know, because I never experienced requited love. I know in theory, how to be a good partner, because I've read a lot of relationship books, but for now that knowledge just makes me feel more lonely... 

Thanks for the encouragement. It's really refreshing to get a different view.

If hope it's OK to you (I don't want to be patronizing or anything), If I recommend one of those books I read: [https://allbooksworld.com/couple-skills-by-matthew-mckay-pdf-download/](https://allbooksworld.com/couple-skills-by-matthew-mckay-pdf-download/). If you'll ever have too much time and you'll want to change your mind on the ""scam"" thing (if you're being serious with that). It's a hard book to read, but it's very methodical, broad and useful."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's hard to choose from all these options. A part of me doesn't want to end up in a 9-5 job. I want to own businesses, but it's easier said than done. I'm into investments and have lost many great opportunities. I opened a business last year, failed, investments failed. I fear that it will all be failing after failing and I'll end up in a 9-5 for the rest of my life. Yeah, I make music, volunteer to do what I can to help as much people as possible."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,So? You have to try. If it isn‚Äôt hard is it worth doing? Worst case you end up broke in a one bedroom apartment. Better than living your life never making an effort.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Understood. And how much do you lose for selling vs exercising?

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The Vancouver housing market isn't something that only impacts teachers mate nobody can afford a house here. The unfettered immigration and lack of restrictions for foreign owners is the big issue here. Huge demand little supply. Go to maple ridge or Langley much more affordable though if you don't want to live in actual Vancouver which I honestly don't know why you would if you want a house.

Isn't this earnings report on 3/23 for the Q4 results? I see a lot of people convinced that this report is going to show a massive spike, driven by the swell of support from the ape and online community.

But, how much hype was there from consumers in the Oct-Dec range? Would we realistically reflect these gains on this next report, or will we not really see them until the Q1 report in three months?

&#x200B;

I Just don't want ~~people~~ apes to have unrealistic expectations and for their hands to turn to paper if the actual results do not meet the hype.

[See my post on GME and other stocks from yesterday which was very successfully buried and received little attention.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m35u61/memeageddon_judgement_day_witching_day_march_19th/)

**Brokerages are starting to realize shorts are in BIG TROUBLE in $GME and $RKT.**

So far $RKT shorts have been in COMPLETE CONTROL of this stock and it's price since they IPOd at $18 in 2020.

In Feb 21 RKT BLASTED away earnings expectations and revenue with growth of 161%! Crazy amazing unexpected growth and profitability. The share price went from $19.90 to $21.85... LOL

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bwx447sfjtm61.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=e718f52e50d2819d41bc226f160d0f2d00562b8c

Since then

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fbroivvgjtm61.png?width=2093&format=png&auto=webp&s=459319c3ad0b896088e1b73b0e1520543769a979

On March 1st and 2nd the shorts got side-lined by a bunch of WSB interest and the price spiked +71% to $43.

RKT CEO says their share price at $43 is OK but they are still not being fairly valued to peers. (youtube links not allowed)

So what do the shorts do? They DOUBLE DOWN as they always do!

They unload millions of new shorts to attack the price:

On March 4th they have dropped the price to $26.80.

**This chart shows the available short shares to borrow and the fee. On March 4th there are ONLY 100,000 shares available and a HUGE BORROWING FEE OF 59%**

&#x200B;

Data from here: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT)

In the meantime paper-handed retail investors HAVE SOLD to this very obvious GME tactic once again and there are now more shorts available! These guys are so good at doubling down.

[Market Watch calls Short Interest at 40% on Feb 26th. Since the price went up and they just shorted millions more shares you can bet your sweet bananas short interest is probably higher.](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/rkt)

From a technical analysis POV the chart has 3 trailing support lines. In other words the price is very unlikely to dip below $23.50. Your downside is very minimal.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ry9hxdfmjtm61.png?width=2118&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dff7ec2116f2f0de0bfdd5be0a7ae90f6318967

The morning of March 12th RKT was UP in pre-market. When the market opened there was huge volume and price drove down, killed the momentum and people thought they lost.

During that same time MILLIONS of shorts were fired:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q8yr8b5njtm61.png?width=387&format=png&auto=webp&s=d55b9cbcddae79869becb78017a1832a6b4dfeda

Shares available went from 5.6M to 1.9M. Then retail SOLD.... You weak apes.

The OPEN INTEREST for MARCH 19th OUT THE MONEY IS INSANE.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6pu6cv0ojtm61.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=a945e90e1e0dfeeef8d416156dca3c3635a26c3e

Check out the strike of $30 with 48,889 contracts. On a float of only 100,000,000 (a little bigger than gme) that represents 4,888,900 shares just there (usually MMs will buy 50% or so as it approaches ITM).

In other words if this gets to $29 it will just keep going up until the highest strike - So above $65 likely.

**That's about a 300% return from current price.**

Also remember we have the DTCC new rule coming soon, we don't know the date yet but that's making the shorts piss their pants as they would have less liquidity to fight with. They really want to shake out all the retail money at the cheapest price THIS WEEK.

**TLDR:**

RKT is one of the most manipulated prices since IPO. Despite amazing performance, surprise earnings, dividends and buyback announcements the stock has been held under $24.

The stock is starting to be put on short-selling restricted lists which means shorts are over-risked and brokerages know this.

RKT has a relatively small float with high short interest. It won't take a lot to light the match. The options interest for next week also allows for a big gamma squeeze if the price hits $29 for a sustained period. We're at $25... It's not a lot to ask for.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT is so close to exploding. The $25 price point right now is a steal. Y'all be wishing you bought more at the current levels.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm really for $RKT, at $25 there's very little to lose but so much to gain (not financial advice). Looking back on the charts it's a stable stock and is clearly undervalued. I'm in, putting in $1,440 Monday. Not financial adviser."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay you sparked my interest. I‚Äôm gonna go do some real DD on RKT and might toss in some hundred dollars for some tickets. Will see, thank you."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like RKT mgmt and stand with them.  The shorts will pay!

Very nice writeup."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,""" In other words if this gets to $29 it will just keep going up until the highest strike - So above $65 likely ""

was wondering if you could explain how it'll keep going up until the highest strike?

on another note, if i remember correctly, a lot of those 50 strikes opened on the day rkt spiked..i was thinking it was shorts hedging their bet"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,hmmm...looks like I might need to buy back my CC and also buy more RKT. I'd be ok if RKT took a solid dip on monday so I could get out of that 6/19 $31.89c I sold like an IDIOT after the spike.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm buying back in

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Better to get call options or shares?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been sitting on my last 21.5 03/19 call, but according to the macd RKT may have hit its floor finally on Friday right before close. I believe its about to move up Monday or throughout the week by a lot. I'll be taking out a new ITM call first thing Monday."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Jacked to da tits
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought 2 $60 RKT calls as my first option March 1st, and sold the next day for a neat $1100 profit. Definitely a fluke, but I've still been keeping an eye on it and might decide to opt in with 5-10 April calls to give it a little time after the 19th to moon. I might also be throwing away my money, but hey, why else would I be here?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The ceo said this, which is why he tried to trigger the short squeeze. Worked for about 5 mins but people cashed out and went back to the Ape adoption stock."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Am I wrong in saying that you cover shorts with additional shorts?   If you shorted at a low price, you can cover the upswing for that short by shorting at a high price?  Are they trying to prevent other people from shorting the stock so that they can minimize their losses?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Positions? Not financial advice I know I know. Just mad curious.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was looking at RKT income statement and I don't understand something, maybe someone here can explain it to me. 

Sales Growth is up 189.98% to $15.15B in 2020 vs 2019 which was 36.57% at $5.22B. 

And the pretax income was 1161.66% at $9.53B in 2020 vs 23.97% at $755.49M in 2019. 

What I don't understand is why the net income growth for 2020 was down 73.66% at net income of $197.95M vs 2019 which was up 23.79% at $751.53M.

Why the drop in net income growth if the sales went up from $5.22B (2019) to $15.15B (2020)"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,As far as calls go what would be your expiration target? Debating on what expiration would work best
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"801 is going to be interesting.  ( expecting a rocky start , )"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"To play devils advocate, why would they short a stock that has such a strong fundamental basis, and growth?  After what happened on GME and AMC, why would they double down?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why are RKT options all priced in weird amounts?

Usually $30, $32,5, $35, $37.5. Etc

Never seen pricing like this before  https://i.imgur.com/y9EppI1.jpg"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Shorts on GME not allowed on Wells either.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The short selling pause is due to a sec rule that stops all shorting if a stock has a 10 % or more dip in a single days trading.  Can't be shorted for the rest of that trading day and the following
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Didn't actually read your post because words, but I can't short GME and RKT?  OH NOEZ!!!!!!!!!!!!  Wait, fuck that.  The only people who want to short those are dumbass fuckwaffle HFs like Shitadel and Melvin Crapital.  Are you implying that I want to short GME and RKT?

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is such bullshit rkt has shitloads of call options on it owned by the same people with shorts on GME shitadel and Melvin capital.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I get you but GME is IT right now. I am fine going in on RKT in the future but this will just be seen as another distraction tool as of right now.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I have no financial knowledge and am just a random guy but $RKT has always just felt fake.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,So you have done your DD and a lot of it is short interest mumbo jumbo that everyone thinks is the way.   Have you done any DD on what happens to Mortgages when interest rates go up as they are and will continue to do so?   Let's see what kind of answer you can DD on this aspect of the company.   Do they win or lose with higher interest rates?      You tell me oh smart one.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Just so you all know RKT is the same as the silver push. It is a hedgie ploy.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I might switch over early if I can.  I feel like GME absolutely has to drop at some point to reconcile the difference between where it is and where it is going, but right now the ""fuck you"" factor is so strong that every news/institution is ignoring the idea that the rules of the market make it so the stock itself is actually worth more than the company.  
  
Like, we support the company but the short squeeze/gamma squeeze is what makes it a solid play.  I'm ready to get out and buy back in when it comes down to earth."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"People bought a lot of those calls for 3/19 and will continue buying now that they are dirt cheap. If we pass $30, the market makers who sold the options will buy more shares in the event that they need to cover 100 shares to every options holder. This creates a feedback loop. They need to buy more shares to cover more calls as the price goes up, and they become the reason the price is going up by buying so many damn shares. Like half of the float, which is already over 100% owned by institutions and retail. We believe this is what happened two weeks ago, and not a true short squeeze. The price topped just above the previous highest strike, as MM had hedged everything at that point. Once people started selling, the MM didn‚Äôt need to hedge so many options, so as they sold and deleveraged, the price tanked. Now we have higher strikes so it can go even higher, especially if a lot of people buy weeklies on Monday. Many people want to light this bomb. We are praying that a hedge fund(s) will help us. However, if we go lower, MM will sell shares because they won‚Äôt need to hedge the $25 calls, which could drive us down lower. Then we would b fuk"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure. Minimum mortgage market volume is $2T or 1/2 the size of the $4T originated in 2020.  The smaller size also means tighter margins but that is partially offset by higher servicing valuation. Rocket has plans to increase market share to 25% by 2030 and based recent loan volume and the public fear of their competitors this goal seems like it will be reached early.

But assuming they do reach 25% market share in 2030, originate at historically low margins, and grow their ancillary business by 10% a year (which is bullshit because they are growing them by 100% in 2021), the company is FMV at $70"

The notice of the rules change was March 5, 2021 and would be implemented by March 19th(10 business days).

However, it affects DTTC members. This includes hedges that have investment banks(AKA Citadel via Citadel Securities, one of RKT's biggest shorts historically) and brokers like Robinhood(to prevent issues like ""Sell Only"" due to volatility), etc...

Overall, this rule means the markets run smoother and the big guys (or their brokers at least) will have to put more skin in the game to continue past shady practices with volatile stocks(this will cause brokers that lend to shorts to increase margin requirements).

I'm buying because I independently see other people stating that they're buying.  Other people are buying because they also see that others are buying.  We don't need to go to WSB to do this either, this is how short term market trends happen as it is.  People see the stock go up and they buy in, regardless of whether or not they see a post from APES_STRONK_HURRR on reddit saying that he's buying.  In fact, *that particular trend* has been abused far more often by big money by getting the ball rolling on good news with a big buy, then cashing out after enough people buy in on the hype.  Those people are being manipulated by buying in without any DD.  We have solid DD here, hence why we buy and decide not to sell even with +400% to +2000% gains.  Why would we sell when we can clearly see a much higher price target even *without* a squeeze?  I see value.  Regardless of what others do, I see profit to be made.  And since so many others see that value as well, we can come to the conclusion that a squeeze will also happen.

No reason to sell.  That's my view on it.  Only reasons to buy and hold."

Short interest was above 100% but then the hedges got mad they were losing and changed the rules and covered a lot while buy orders were restricted.  Then it was around 40% and consolidated between 40-50.  Now after this spike it is around 10%.  That‚Äôs not enough to offset the amount of buys on WSB alone.  Now they definitey could double down bc they are arrogant pricks but I‚Äôd rather wait for it to drop and consolidate again and then jump back in around $80 and keep accumulating all the way down as far as they can push it.  I love the stock long term and fee like these prices right now won‚Äôt seem crazy in a year or two, but I‚Äôll take my chances on the negative boomer sentiment taking the edge on this low of short interest for the short term.

I just wanna say, I hope this shit keeps going up and every short gets fucked, but I just don‚Äôt see it right now and there WILL be bag holders on this sub (in my opinion, I‚Äôm not a seer).

First the stimmy gets priced in, people buying in anticipation of new money. Second, stimmy money hits starting the 17th (from most reports). Next the FOMO rush will either boost the stimmy spike or it produces its own at the end of the week.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep that‚Äôs it! Just yolo‚Äôd 1400 in GME. To the fucking moon!!! üöÄüöÄüöÄüåù

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the exact opposite, they‚Äôll let it rise to 300 and keep it sideways. More expensive, less shares to buy. If they crash it, more people will buy more shares, increasing the velocity. But that‚Äôs what I think"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,They're not blind to the stimulus though; it'd be a bad plan to decided to crash the price the day that Ape investors bank accounts are getting a cash injection to buy more. Surely they'd want that money to enter at a high price and then crash once the stimmy money is invested?

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah my guy, not to argue but sell offs don't equate to a drop at 350 to 190 in 10 minutes. On top of that 350 is such an insanely important number you have to be insane to think its a  Coincidence. I don't know the exact fundamentals but I bet my ass if the moving average passes 350 thats what will cause the boom. Screenshot this. Save it. You heard it here."

Here's my conservative estimates:

    75% of WSB's 9.5M members are yanks
    Half of that are eligible for stim money
    Half of that put in half their $1,400
    So... USD$1.2B goes into GME

Is that a lot? Will it make a difference? No clue."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I already got mine and haven't filed 2020 taxes yet. Past ones I think what type of financial institution you use was a factor. Mine is a credit union.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely amazing write up. Thank you for taking the time to share your views. You have definitely opened my mind to the other side of things. I now see why GME is such a unquie squeeze, but I still see potential with AMC. I believe the May Fourth vote is simply to count shares and trigger a squeeze. If I am wrong, I am out a lot of of money, but so far I've almost doubled my money. Is this increase in AMC because of covid restrictions lifting? I don't think intially but I believe that is a factor now. I believe people have done their own DD and see potential as I do. I can't lie though, you are persuasive. 

 I think it's a safer play as Q2 report will probably show incredible gains making a $20 stock price achievable. Post Covid AMC is profitable. Look what happened when NYC opened. LA is opening theaters Monday. I think this natural increase in price will also trigger more people to think ""the rocket can take off"" and fomo sets in.

In conclusion, I see AMC as a legit long play with the potential of a squeeze. Hopefully their board members also see the potential as GMEs board has. 

Kind sir or madam, I would love to share a beer with you some day. I appreciate the conversation."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, no doubt that will be a hefty bill. Have you set up a ""go fund me"" in case GME doesn't get as high as you hope? I hope that they will do the transplant regardless and let you pay off the bill when you can."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I am doing well. My wife is doing almost as well as I am so we aren't getting any from the numbers I've seen. Just wish I had waited.

Class A effort though, champ"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I said they dilutED shares and you said they hadn't.

They did.

Also, that didn't wipe out their debt. They were paying off *some of their* debts carried forward from 2015-2017 and accrued in 2020. They also took out a $500mm loan from Odeon.

It *shifted* their debt by near a billion. That was the debt they were expected to cover in 2020.

They haven't cleared their debt. They've clung on for life. The $900m injecting of capital was essential to  not breach covenants with their creditors. It isn't capital for growth or development of the company.

Also, they're going to collapse all classes of shares into a single class. Introducing 500m more shares to the available float.

Do you want me to use Google for you again?

This is just dull. You've invested in a company you don't even know the financial health of.

The RAV4 Prime is the first one that makes sense to me. It allows the acceleration and torque of an EV and the mileage/quick refuel of a gas engine. PHEV allows for easier cross country road trips and is more practical for towing than things. 

You can make daily commutes on the 30-50 mi they give you on electric and use the gas for longer trips. IMO they are really good until supercharger networks get larger and more standardized and you want something larger than a sedan right now. 

If the cybertruck performs against other trucks as well as Tesla‚Äôs cars do against other cars, then Ford, Toyota etc. are fucked."

Some time in your life, you will drive a Tesla or a car that's a carbon copy of a Tesla. No, you're not going to do this because of me or other Tesla fanboys. You're going to do this because eventually all of your friends and family will make the switch. And when you do, you will be amazed at how silly your current viewpoints are. You will find out that a 400 mile road trip in a Tesla actually takes less refueling time than a gas car (a trip has to be 600+ miles long until a Tesla loses this battle).

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dunno its not a comfortable road trip car for me, I mean for years it was the best ""round town"" car for reliability/efficiency for sure but now I like the new restyled pure EV Nissan Leaf with 250lb-ft of torque.   Way more fun to drive, and no gas cost at all.  I got mine with 150 mile range for \~$17K new after government rebate and all discounts considered.  On days I drive a lot I still tend to be under 100 miles, so its absolutely perfect.  Have a gas guzzling SUV for those longer road trips or towing the boat but overall the Leaf goes pretty much everywhere!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You want weak? Try driving a mitsubishi mirage. I saw a doug demuro review on one and I was rolling on the floor when he had his game face on while getting on the freeway with it. I thought it would never reach 60

I can't bring myself to spend that much on something that depreciates in value so much. But again, I've also had the chance to drive whatever I wanted and got a lot of that out of my system.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fun fact the 80's Mercedes 300 diesel were such bulletproof cars, I actually almost bought one 15 years ago planning to run filtered waste veggie oil  (WVO) instead of diesel.   Its one of the few engines that can handle that just fine, you generally have two tanks one regular diesel to get it running then swap over to WVO tank once it warms up.  But alas my winter temps in the Pacific Northwest get too cold for WVO in the winter!  Plus all of a sudden when fuel hit $4+/gal for the first time the restaurants finally figured out their WVO was a semi-valuable commodity!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,People will tailgate anything they percieve as slow no matter how fast they're going. I get tailgated in my work van doing 20 over the limit with my strobes on.

Your sports car is not cool if it loses to a used Leaf that costs $6000."

But you didn't answer my question about the consequences of shorters self-reporting the wrong info. Probably because you know there are none. I also didn't say finra *shows* their short position, I said they report their short position to finra. It's not anonymous to finra, lol. We just see the total, ofc.

Further, they would have needed 35+ million shares by the ""official"" numbers, from Feb 1-15. Who sold them those shares, and how would the price *still* be decreasing? *All* of retail only holds about 7 million shares.

Of course some covered, Melvin did and lost half his firm. Others doubled down and helped drive the price from 480 to 40. If you think HFs that stand to lose half their firm aren't lying in their self-report to finra that has virtually no consequences, you're delusional.

I am new, but I am also very eager to learn as I would like to continue investing post-GME.  That said, it is so calming, as a new investor, to read thorough DD to keep your emotions in check.

IMO, whales are waiting for the IV to flatten to make far OTM calls super cheap once again.  When this happens, a few million dollars can be used to put pressure on people who wrote naked calls.  Conventional wisdom says OTM calls don't effect a stocks price, but if a stock is heavily shorted this is no longer true.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Do what‚Äôs a realistic amount
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rough numbers cause I don't know these off the top of my head -but.

Float is ~50 million

Ryan cohen , the board, and other insiders with locked up shares is ~15 million.

Institutional ownership is ~25 million. 

A large amount maybe half? is in etfs, pension funds, mutual funds that can only readjust portfolios every three months and other passive investments so we will say ~13 mill.

These are rough numbers cause I don't remember the exact and the % of institutional investors that are passive is a guess but it is probably a lot higher then that estimate just because the majority of active institutions would've cashed out in the January run up.

So 50 mill minus 15 mill minus 13 mill equals 22 million shares available. If the shorts to cover is 22 million then almost everyone will be able to cash out in the squeeze.

Don't trust my numbers though I failed third grade."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mostly theta things I actually want. Despite being a meme I love PLTR future prospects. I also love AMD, CCIV, PSTH. I'm trying not to get executed because of margin limits but if I did I'd prob just grip the bar and hold on without selling calls because the future is bright and the gamma is unpredictable.

I sold a bunch of GME puts between $40-80 strikes because it's free money. With Cohen at the helm if GME is worth less than $125 a share naturally I'd be shocked."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,How far out are you going on the $GME expiries?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The short interest being under 1% and dark pool back door trades is what scares me away at this point. After that insane dip Wednesday and how easy it was for them to do it and then control the price on Friday without having to cause a panic sale to not hit the 270-275-300 calls (there was a fuck ton) is very concerning.

I believe once the stimmy hits that will be more shares bought but yes if calls are not met Friday and there is mass buying at market price...I fear for the worst."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure you do.

I like money."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was going a couple weeks. Honestly I think the stock is probably a longterm steal at $75 so I just keep rolling whatever is profitable/reasonable around there.

I'm stopping now. After 3/19 I expect GME to crash so don't wanna play until it rebases and I can't draw max profit out of it"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is not the way.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"hmmm.. I'm sure you would agree then that apes should beware of the shills and do their own DD as well;  Apes should research on ""Delta Hedging"" and learn how it works;  Apes should not blindly purchase options contracts;   There is no exact date when the squeeze will squoze? And apes are obviously helping to inflict some level of pain, otherwise the stock wouldn't be climbing steadily and HF's wouldn't be trying so hard with big money tactics.? And apes should  ""HOLD THE LINE"".?  Not Financial advise."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those of us who were stomping up and down on the German regulator  and were ultimately proven right when they banned short-selling when there was obvious accounting fraud at Wirecard AG totally understand the point that article is making.

There are however rules and those rules should be strictly enforced or you end up in a situation where 140% of float or many times that in reality is shorted and you start posing a systemic risk. This whole ""I can cough up when I like and nobody will say anything or at worst I can write an IOU"" nonsense has got to stop too. If you're shorting a stock it should be an actual stock that you have in your possession, and when you're out you should return an actual stock - no 1 day later, no 7 day later, no 4 weeks later, no cash alternatives, actual stock; immediately. In the modern era of totally electronic trades this should be trivial, and anybody violating that should be guilty of what it is: criminal fraud."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You shouldn‚Äôt be able to sell what you don‚Äôt own. Stupid rules made to be able to commit fraud and kill companies that don‚Äôt deserve it.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course short sellers serve an important function to expose fraudulent companies and protect smaller investors.

I mean, we all remember David Einhorn's famous short campaign against Allied Capital. He was screaming about ACs fraud through the rooftops from 2002-2008. He went to SEC multiple times, provided a shitton of evidence and did everything possible to educate and flag up the fraud, ten times over.

It actually took the fucking 2008 housing crash for AC to actually unravel because no official body would do any-fucking-thing about it, despite overwhelming evidence against it.

So, yes, shorts can do good and honest work, but no-one is really listening.

Then there are the vultures who collude and use their buying power to run companies to the ground and/or jump in to strip their assets while their knocked out cold."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you buy a stock, even if it's in a cash account,  the stock is registered under the broker's name. They actually own the stock. It is on the broker's balance sheet.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"My comments won't explain as well as the many many posts on this board. But simply, they are shorting shares that don't exists. They are shorting so much, that they have shorted more shares than actually exist. To circumvent settlement rules, they trade amongst each other (sometimes afterhours) just to prolong the farce. They creat derivative instruments on these fake shares to further complicate and hide their fraudulent trades."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,We are most certainly the product.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"You say that, but Overstock was complaining about this shit in the early 2000s.  In fact, Patrick Byrne ended up building tools that would prevent this kind of thing as a big old FU to the industry, but eventually was forced out of his company two decades later.  The DTCC is the end result of a long and tortured history centered around stock certificate delivery and net accounting.  The late 1990s and early 2000s is when thing really started to get out of control.

Say what you will about Patrick Byrne, but you have to respect the hell out of a guy that sticks to his ethos for two decades and goes down swinging trying to right the wrongs the industry has continuously perpetrated."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"All brokerages, at the end of the day, run a netting operation.  That one fact, in-and-of-itself, creates a lot of ""notional"" accounting.  When up-stream market makers feel like their ""notional"" accounting has entered insolvency territory, that's when you see just how free the ""free"" market actually is.

Netting operations behave in a very similar way to fractional reserve banking, where-by money can be created via debt.  As long as you manage the debt creation and associated net accounting, you can become very, very, very wealthy.  That's why the industry is so incredibly defensive when the sharp edge of a corner case bumps into the market's shin.  They are loathed to see **any** kind of regulation interfere with their money making machine."

Short selling allows the SSers to potentially drive the price of stock down by selling large amounts of the shares that they've borrowed, kind of like being a self fulfilling prophechy.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Kinda ironic, isn't it?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm always happy to try and help indulge somebody's mental midgetry! 
So yeah, puts don't have as much of an effect on the actual price of a stock, until they start getting close to the money, at the money, and in the money, because the market makers who wrote those puts have to hedge against the contracts by selling stock (look up how Delta hedging works... it works the same way but opposite for calls - they hedge by buying the stock), which can accelerate the fall of an already declining stock.  
Because, a put is a contract to enter a short position at a certain date if the stock falls below a certain price. You don't have to exercise the option, obviously, instead selling it to somebody else before expiration, but all puts, if they expire ITM, are exercised by SOMEBODY.  The big crash last March was accelerated by market makers having to sell en masse to Delta hedge against all the puts they wrote that were suddenly in the money.  
Short selling and put buying/selling are intrinsically intertwined and you can't have one without the other.
Short selling in and of itself isn't bad.  I'm sure plenty of other people in this thread have already pointed out it's benefits, and honestly, if it were completely banned the markets would grind to a halt anytime there was a bear run.  Retail, and even financial institutions don't have much power to artificially suppress a stock price thru shorting unless it's done in massive quantities and volumes, to the point of naked shorting, like what we saw w the stonk (and let's be honest retail has almost zero power to affect a stock price, we're just along for the ride).  Nefarious shorters will usually resort to other means to drive a stock down, like spreading FUD or misinformation after they've entered their short position."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Financial media along with all media has been corrupted. You basically need individuals you can trust like deepfuckingvalue and then you need to carefully keep and eye on them to make sure they don‚Äôt fall victim to corruption.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah... I looked into this.  The DTCC suspended redeeming positions to physical certificates at the start of the pandemic.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for taking the time.  I'm familiar with Delta and hedging, but I suppose I never followed the steps in my mind to the point that you just made.  Makes sense now.

It‚Äôs a healthy stock that will get back to 20 at some point when the world opens back up again and people actually start going to theaters. I‚Äôd say do your DD and look into a promising SPAC. $40 will get you roughly 4 shares, and if the merger goes as planned, you can maybe watch your $10 share turn into $40-60 within a year. If it flops and the merger falls thru, you get your $10/share back. Ex: a spac that‚Äôs sitting at 10.21 is a pretty safe bet. If it fails, you‚Äôre only losing the 21 cents.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Right so I don't remember every single thing I learned In college but I know for a fact I know more about the concepts than someone who failed every class....
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not saying no universities give out failing grades or even that most don't but I'm guessing you know that and are just pretending to not understand nuance. I'm saying that in many programs you have to try to fail and many of these programs are well regarded.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I disagree. The nature of capitalism is hyper competitive, of you don't have what it takes to pass the courses you won't pass. Any professor worth his salt isn't just hanging out A's because some kids daddy is paying the bills. Nuance has nothing to do with it, sure you can get an art history degree from university of phoenix with less effort than a Organic Chem degree from UGA, but I promise you more people fail out than get degrees. That's literally just a fact, you can not fake an education. If I pay you  50 bucks and say I'm an expert in neurology you probably won't trust me to operate on your brain. Or do your taxes, or advise you on investments, or do anything that I haven't proven I can do first"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was wrong so i fixed my post, also that athlete failed the SAT 4 times?? So you really can't fake an education. He failed the SAT, faked it, went to college for a semester, and got drafted to the NBA (a job that requires no education whatsoever) if you put an SAT in front of him today he would probably still fail it worse than someone who took it in high school. The point is mute"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Everything is up 100% in the last year.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"GaAs has, like you said, a low bandgap energy, but most important, a direct bandgap. I actually use these for detectors in the Infrared regime. GaAs is an absoluetly superb material for photonics. But market for this is tiny.

Solar Cells based on Ga are therefore really efficient. Even when not used in a multi-junction cell with another material. When used in MMJ you get over 30% (not in a lab, you can actually buy this). It's only used in space (Satellites) right now. Problem is cost.

A few years ago, GaAs was hyped like sh... to be the successor of silicon. By now we should have CPUs with \~250GHz speed. Yeah well...that didn't play out so well. Silicon industry will not die so quick and the price basically only depends on energy. 

And this is the overall Problem with Gallium. As well as Indium in CIGS-cells ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper\_indium\_gallium\_selenide\_solar\_cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_indium_gallium_selenide_solar_cells))

It is mined as a byproduct and price is volatile

This is a good read:

[https://www.electronicdesign.com/technologies/gans/article/21801404/how-will-we-get-the-gallium](https://www.electronicdesign.com/technologies/gans/article/21801404/how-will-we-get-the-gallium)

You basically need a country, a big country or a union of countries to enable supply chains and fix the price. Because otherwise nobody will invest in the product (but only in the mining ;) )"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you think about what the term ‚Äúfundamentals‚Äù is **actually** implying, you might realize how they might make sense.

Effectiveness of fundamentals relies on the market‚Äôs general willingness to tie a company‚Äôs success to their monetary outlay; its somewhat tethering the company to currency. 

Because the market trades in currency, this leads to share value no longer being based on the actual or predicted value of the company (in currency). That is why the shares become more volatile or prone to sentiment.

Basically, if the market operated purely on fundamentals and had perfect information, stocks would move up and down in a perfect line based on company performance. 

Because of the nature of large numbers and people‚Äôs unwillingness to take on too much risk, the market generally oscillates around where it  that imaginary ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù line might be (like an average of sorts). 

In that sense, the fundamentals help mitigate risk for all on the market by tying most companies‚Äô valuations to metrics that are quantifiable rather than subjective."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It doesn't help push the price up at all. The whole point of the exercise is they get the shares at a fixed price. The hedge fund then takes all the shares they've got in a position they don't want and they sell them. Where do you think the 259k shares sold with a limit sell of 240 on Wednesday came from? The entire ride down, halts and all, was driven by that one sell order being partially fulfilled between halts.  


This is what the backside of the gamma squeeze looks like. You transferred a lot of premiums to hedge funds and market makers, and then you transferred shares. Now they can pump the price down with puts they bought at the beginning of this squeeze for April targets. As the price falls, they don't have to keep shares to hedge against all the calls, so they sell more shares, driving the price lower. Gamma squeezes also come in the negative variety, and we're on the verge of seeing it."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I completely agree. My commentary was more about the psychological perception of value in a broader, more philosophical sense, perhaps even fundamentally lol. I was just pointing out that much of value is extrinsic. For instance diamonds, intrinsically its just a fucking rock for the most part, perhaps good for certain technical and industrial use because of its hardness. More rare than other rocks (artificially, looking at you De Beers), but other than that nothing really sets it apart from glass. However, because of extrinsic value it is incredibly lucrative. I'm aware of the interplay between fundamentals and speculation in the market, but on a basic level, if you are an outlier and you see that the value of something could be changed by changing public perception, then you can capitalize off of it."

Did you not even look at their numbers the entire year? They exceeded expectations every quarter, and 4th quarter is going to their best more than likely. 

Gamestop also has an online store you can use. They're not just brick and mortar."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's definitely some overlap, but that doesn't mean they're not still distinct. It's more just that an individual's valuation will have fundamental and speculative components. In the case of DFV, for example, he believed it was a good play with little downside based on the company's financials and the market space in the video game sector.  Those are all rooted in fundamentals. The short interest and the prospects of shifting into an e-commerce business model were the more speculative aspects of his thesis. Those remain speculative aspects even with how things turned out -- there's nothing in the fundamentals of Gamestop as a company that warrant its current valuation."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, in fact its pretty rare for people to exercise their contract by actually buying the 100 shares. The profit you would make if you theoretically did buy the 100 shares at the strike price is already built into the price of the contract. Most people just sell the contract."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"i disagree. At current price point, I see GME fundamentally undervalued."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What fundamentals are you basing that on?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's one way for a shorter to turn the call option writers into bag holders. Big short from 350 followed by repeated shorting at lower levels to prevent the call option writer from ever selling their delta neutral shares. 

Presumably call option writers hedge their delta neutral shares with put options otherwise this would be too easy. It could even be the call option writer that did the shorting using its accumulated shares.

Then it becomes a liquidity war, who has more money than the call option writers to continue the squeeze.

Certainly retailers can reduce the float putting upward pressure on the price making it easier for a whale to step in."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"People are somehow forgetting to mention you also paid a premium for those shares to enter the contract. So while your call might be for $265 if your premium is $15, then you pay $1500 for the contract and $265 per share. Soooo your ""break even"" price would actually be $280."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"If a bunch of people exercise at the same time, theoretically the price goes up. If the price goes down afterwards is either because people were fine with the price and chose to sell or because entities short the stock again. That I cannot tell you for sure because I don't know. Stocks go up, stocks go down. 

There's many reasons I don't think it gets that high. One, people will sell way before that. Everyone kept saying at 40 how they are diamond hands yadda yadda and the second they broke even (because they lost a lot of money buying at 300 in the first squeeze) sold all their shares. They were happy to see their money back and get out of here. 

Two, retail is not the only player in here, there are lots of HFs that own stock. If the HFs choose to sell before retail, the shorts will cover anyway and retail will end up holding the bag. Be VERY careful about this because HFs have lots of shares. For them to sell even at 1000 per share, after they bought at...9 dollars, is the equivalent of you buying at 200 and selling at around 23.000. So keep that in mind. They make huge profits anyway and they absolutely don't care about you or what you want. Protect yourself.

Three, a 100k price means an absurd amount. This stock has never seen 500 since its creation and people talk about 100k. That is a whopping 200 TIMES the return from the heighest point the stock ever was. So from the highest is ever been it needs to increase 19.900%. I think you see how astronomical these numbers are. 

I don't know where it will get. I don't know if it squeezes. There's probably so many things happening behind the scenes that we are not aware of. What I will do is sell 1-2 shares at a time if it squeezes, to make sure I go along the whole journey. A squeeze doesn't happen in 1 hour, it takes 1-2-4 days or something. So we'll see."

Practically, this is only partly true because there is emotional buy and sell as well as companies going into or leaving indexes and those mechanically bring the stock up or down because the manager of those funds messed poches do stocks or sell them you've they are leaving the index.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cross-posting a comment here from a similar thread, hoping to hear to hear some counter analyses.

Growth is stellar, but they were basically doing what Ant was doing before the regulation crackdown.

Some more nice colour about this company for folks, - this is a holding company for the [360 Jietiao](https://www.360jie.com.cn/) microloan app, a company from [Qihoo 360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qihoo_360).

I found this stock earlier this year, and I came across this - [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/07/2075242/0/en/360-Finance-Inc-to-Hold-Extraordinary-General-Meeting-on-September-15-2020.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/07/2075242/0/en/360-Finance-Inc-to-Hold-Extraordinary-General-Meeting-on-September-15-2020.html)\- that they changed their name to remove **Finance** for no conceivable reason, without providing any feedback. The original name of the company was Qihoo 360 Finance.

A quote from a Nikkei article about the Ant IPO last year:

>Nikkei: Aside from the excitement of these recent days, two tectonically important points remain: firstly, that Ant's business model, unregulated, would have potentially created systemic risk at a global level; and secondly, that Ant's leadership tried to escape appropriate financial-sector regulatory scrutiny, even removing the word ""financial"" from their name just before their IPO application in July 2020.

Another thing that you haven't mentioned OP is what the ***new*** financial regulations are that came out of the Ant IPO knee-capping. Some but not all of the regulations microlending companies must now follow:

1. They need to keep 30% of the loaned amount on hand, instead of just 2% (OP's quote mentions 1%, but this was before the new regulations were imposed). Meaning their growth drastically cuts, because they cannot loan as much.
2. The balance of funds received by a microfinance company through bank loans, shareholder loans and other non-standard financing forms shall not exceed 1 times its net assets.
3. Licenses to be granted on 3 year terms, and subject to more scrutiny.
4. There's something Bloomberg mentions, that I can't find an original citation for from the CPP: *A shareholder cannot control more than one micro-lender operating nationally*

That‚Äôs why I like the stock.  I wasn‚Äôt trying to say that they‚Äôre 1% capitalized for their micro loans. 

If a significant chunk of their revenue came from microlending then I would not have the same opinion of the company.

The fact that so many people *think* that they‚Äôre going to be hit by the microlending regulations is exactly why i think the stock is undervalued."

I might be stupid here, but there's a lot of parallels here. Rugpulling someone who poses a huge risk by sending them huge fees. The main difference is it seems whatever rules they used to rugpull Robinhood they were already assessing daily.  


My question here, and sorry if this is really dumb, is there any chance that this new rule is to give them more power to rugpull people who are long on GME as opposed to the shorters?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"No problem - don't accept robonhood's view that it was the NSCC who rugpulled them. The DTCC's statement ahead of the hearing next week states the capital requirements for their members (not sure Robinhood are a member, but their prime broker definitely is) increased, but they used their discretion to waive this fee in accordance with their rules half an hour before opening, but robinhood and others chose to restrict trading anyway. I really want the answer to this in the upcoming hearing as it makes no sense.

The new rule for me is either a disincentive for members to enter risky positions in the first place, especially doubling, tripling down and if not, we're taking your capital and if that makes you default, we exit you from those positions and take as much from you as possible before we settle; either to prevent gamestop's happening again, or to close out the current crap storm.

That's just my read of the situation though, if you have time I'd check out the DTCC'S statement ahead of the hearing, makes for interesting reading as it counters Robonhood's twice changed story so far. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/PDFs/DTCC-Statement-February-2021-Mike-Bodson.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwi6_qLz3q_vAhUnQxUIHVQRAFkQFjAAegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw10Cd30dLTXhcjnTHRbPJyF"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It gets shorted like hell because not many institutions got a pieces on the pie. The company held on to majority of the shares, so institution does not like that and won't let the company get rich without letting them getting a piece of the pie. If the CEO didn't held onto this large chunk of shares, this would have skyrocketed higher per share. The hedge funds just don't like to see this one individual getting rich, so they are going to short it to hell to keep the price low.

This is almost similar to how Amazon was in it's early days when Bezos held onto majority share and the price didn't move much. It skyrocketed after the shares gets distributed to institutions, and they get rich together. 

Only difference back then with Amazon is, there is no retail investors like today that are ready to push them out of their shorts. Today, retail investors have the strength to win the game unlike the past"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the statement of trying to make obsolete an entire profession is abit extreme. The key point here is disrupting, i don't think RKT can replace legacy brokers completely, but it innovate on the problem and provide a different solution in hope for a more efficient/effective system. The current system is inefficient and I will leave it at that. Something that is not efficient today, doesn't mean it can't be made better over time..

I see RKT as a disruption to the industry, just like how Paypal have disrupted digital payment back in the days - people were saying they have credit card, they don't need Paypal, and see where it's at now. GooglePay, ApplePay and many follow suit.

Redfin is already disrupting the realtor market. Did they make realtor obsolete? I don't think so, home buyer/seller can still choose to go with old school realtor and pay their 3%+3% commission if they hate money that much. Because of Redfin, home buyers and sellers are paying less whether they use Redfin or independent realtor nowadays. It gives consumer a choice and an opportunity for a different ecosystem to innovate.

When Amazon launch their online store, people were laughing that online store will not succeed because people can't see what they are buying. And yet, we have so many of these online store nowadays. Did it wipe out B&M? Don't think so, but it disrupted it.

Alot of examples if you look around........."

Telco is a complicated setup to track money, everything's very intertwined. My company may have mettel as the overall phone/internet provider for a site but the actual access points and lines maybe from Comcast and Verizon Wireless  or (insert other cable provider and wireless provider)

companies like Vonage, Windstream and mettel will be the overall provider for the contract but they subcontract out the copper lines and hardware."

otherwise, i am selling a few calls for the wheels in motion"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you use 20sma for buying calls?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,i've heard  that too
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"see if i am buying with hype priced in and about to become a bag holder.   
compare the 20sma and the strike. on that day, the stock was over the 9 and 20, so way above average.  i bought at the peak so far out it was stupid. and it shows with my 99% loss on those calls. In the past this stock pulled back down to the sma.  i now use 9 and 20sma in helping to see if i should buy a call. this is new for me.  In testing on pltr i bought when the stock was pushed down below either 9 or 20sma. those calls are up 20% now. option sellers sell calls on green day's, sell puts on red days for max potential. so as a buyer, do the opposite.  mind this is not a rule. or financial advice but a guide and develop your own ideas on this. i pick my nose with crayons. maybe perhaps."

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"How about the fastest average closing time? There is a reason why they can close loans so fast (around 14 days). My broker went through them and I went from submission to Cleared to Close in 7 days, closed in 10 because I wanted to close on a Saturday. The technology is all broker and internal facing that vastly improves efficiencies.

They have internal employees who act as processors to get standard stuff like payoff, insurance, title, ect. So that brokers can focus less requirements, close loans faster, and get after new clients.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"That free fall was INSANE!  Nobody could have :/ but hey you learned how those options work.

Imagine buying 1000$ of those contracts..

If they went from 50$ -> 650$ and you had 20 contracts (1000$) ..  

20 contracts  x $650 = 13,000$... off 1000$ bet.  That‚Äôs one way of going big dick energy on options lol

Lets assume 25% of the 9.5M users are bots, shills, Europoors or lurkers. That leaves 7.6M pure bred American ü¶çü¶çü¶ç. If they follow the income break down of the general population, more than 80% (possibly as high as 95%) of households will qualify for stimulus checks; that leaves us with 6.08M apes about to get a fat casino chip injection.

The average number of individuals per house hold per the most recent data is 2.53, meaning on average each qualifying household could get $3,542. This means that WSB Apes could soon be sitting on as much as $21.5B üçåüçåüçå. That is massive buying power.

13 dollars up on 9 is closr to a 70% change. 

So yea im doubling down before shockingly your the only retard to try and argue I'm wrong. Shoot tge guy I even origin replied too had a link from earlier that day saying similar shit as me when he was watching those option calls.

Stimulus checks after this are probably not going to happen, and assuming that the country reopens and GDP growth pushes 6-7% YoY the FED will be inclined to decrease printing as they need to find some type of equilibrium. They can't do this forever.

The only other thing I think is somewhat on the horizon is YCC. There really isn't anything to ""look"" for after that. Even an infastructure package would be too small and spread out to be comparable to this type of money saturation that we are seeing now and over the next month or so.

I was in a restaurant and I went to the bathroom because I had to poop. However, the toilet made no sense...it was basically kind of a whirlpool in the air. I tried to figure it out for awhile and couldn't. Eventually, I figured out... something?... and a wizard showed up.  
  
The wizard said, ""Oh, you want to poop? Come with me."" So I followed him down these stairs leading out of the bathroom. ""If you want to poop, you'll have to solve a puzzle,"" he said. ""There's only a 1.6% chance you'll solve it."". 
  
We ended up in a big workshop kinda thing, with some tables and a bunch of people working on projects or whatever. ""Here's a hint for the puzzle,"" he went on, ""You'll need to combine a few things to make it, and it's something you can wrap around your hand... and something you can hold in your hand. Get to work.""  
  
So...I had no idea what the hell he wanted, and I accomplished nothing. He pretty quickly got impatient and gave up and said, ""It's Doritos nacho cheese chips, they're fucking delicious!"" And then he shoved his hand into a big bag of them and started eating them.  
  
Then I woke up. That's it, that's the dream.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You can grab April 21 $10 calls for .84 a share.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,There is an ‚Äúafter‚Äù?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would swap out now. AMC, with their recent share dilution, is trading at a market cap not seen since before streaming existed. Further, they have more debt than they‚Äôll ever be able to pay back. (Analysts recently out price targets of $1 and $0.01 for AMC.)

UWMC is way less risky, and much more likely to rise from here. A forward P/E below 7 is dirt cheap. This has been beaten down because of the fear of rising rates affecting refinancing but I think that whole narrative is off base. They make more money on mortgage origination and we are seeing more people moving out of cities (ie going from renting to buying) with more work from home flexibility. 

I think this spring (very soon) we will see a lot more homes go up on the market and a boom in new mortgages. Rates are still very very low, and I doubt it‚Äôll have a significant impact on people moving."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is that a reason not to buy??  A small float is a good thing.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, there is a shortage of supply because the demand is so high... this has to be hugely beneficial to UWMC and RKT.  Mortgage rates going up 0.5% aren‚Äôt gonna stop that."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It will do that again. HF will fuck the price again and again, shorting right before and then realizing gains, tanking price, realize more gains and buy up more shares for cheap, bringing price up, and again and again, while retailers hold the bags"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The only point where 4 x 90c contracts would be worth 10K total at any point during the lifespan of the proposed trade would require the stock to hit ~106 on or before April 11 and the trade rolled out or closed.  This seems...unlikely?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"According to this S-4 filing (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000119312520309831/d83168ds4.htm), 1 XLNX share will become 1.7234 AMD shares. XLNX is currently around $125 per share, while AMD is about $81 per share. According to the exchange ratio, XLNX should be valued at about $81 x 1.7234 = $139 per share. Of course, there may be risks that the merger doesn't actually happen but AMD got regulatory approvals in the US already. Just waiting for China now.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a tangental company, how do you feel about $PLUG? 

I've seen a lot of experts say $PLUG this is a truly terrible company and eventual bankruptcy isn't even out of the question. Would $PLUG doing bad be good for $BE?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"They took an unfair haircut in the recent correction, which is why they're running so much faster than the others that dragged them down ($FCEL, $PLUG, $LPD, etc.).    Moreover, the annual California energy problems and the debacle in Texas are going to spur municipal adoption, so their forward guidance is going to be strong.  Caltech, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, and the state of Delaware are basically all-in on these products and, as none of those areas have experienced any power delivery issues (CalTech's is an especially good use case because of the rolling blackouts and unreliable grid), they're basically proof of concepts for everywhere else to go in on the model to avoid making the bad kind of headlines.  Basically, there's nowhere else essential facilities and municipalities can turn to to \*guarantee\* they will have juice."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Two completely different plays.  Plug makes batteries and is in transport. Bloom is purely infrastructure.

I play Plug.  I own Plug.  But Plug is a crowded trade.

Plug is one of the reasons why bloom is such an attractive buy right now, though.  Battery companies dragged down bloom even though they're different plays"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Which I discussed in my DD.  It emits CO2 if you run nat gas through it, yes, but less than a nat gas facility (and waaaaay less than coal).  Also costs less per kw/h than grid energy.  Further, if you run biogas through them, they're carbon negative (the trade-off being biogas is expensive, though those prices are coming down).  Further, the current focus of their R&D is to figure out how to harness the CO2 and re-use it.

&#x200B;

Batteries drain.  Boxes don't.  Further, battery farms are basically just proofs of concept and science experiments right now, not actualized markets.  There's South Australia (which has the benefit of space for wind, and has to pull from the grid when the wind isn't blowing....and only provides 100MW), and the project in Angleton (which nobody knows how it will turn out) and that's kind of it.  Further, the presumption is the battery will require solar or wind to charge.  As a Bloom server generates energy at 55% efficiency and solar only does so at 17%, the servers are more efficient.  They also take up one-hundred-twenty-times LESS space than the requisite amount of solar space to produce their energy.

&#x200B;

I think you're mistaken re:  Google.  The old, hand-assembled Bloom servers they got ages ago were pulled out....they've been replaced by the newer, factory line boxes that are more efficient.  I know this because I just saw them about 6 months ago."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that's what I suspected. Even though they're different, the dips and peaks are nearly identical to the battery boys like PLUG.

You seem to have experience in this so I am wondering, how long until the fact that *this is a completely different play* reaches the finance sector and actually shows up in the stocks price?"

A few things will put a bigger point on it, though:

Eventually the battle royale between the battery makers will resolve and consolidate.  That will help the sympathy movement you're talking about.

The other is going to be regulation in architecture and focus on infra will result in a divergence in earnings and forward guidance"

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reminds me of a movie quote, by John Goodman in The Gambler.

‚ÄúYou get up two and a half million dollars, any asshole in the world knows what to do: 

you get a house with a 25 year roof, an indestructible Jap-economy shitbox, you put the rest into the system at three to five percent to pay your taxes and that's your base, get me? 

That's your fortress of fucking solitude. That puts you, for the rest of your life, at a level of fuck you. 

Somebody wants you to do something, fuck you. Boss pisses you off, fuck you! 

Own your house. Have a couple bucks in the bank. Don't drink. That's all I have to say to anybody on any social level.‚Äù"

The fact that buying is even legal is insanity to begin with because the goal of buying is to sell the stock back at a higher price which buying stocks inherently does."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, they basically need to put a system in place that prevents shares from being shorted multiple times. If a share has been borrowed and sold, it should not be possible to lend it out again (IMO). And naked shorting should be abolished completely w/ all loopholes closed.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except no one is forcing their opinion on you right now, merely pointing out your stupidity. You'll probably be surprised to find out that I also dislike cancel culture. I'd just prefer the term used only when it actually happens and not as a knee-jerk reaction term to anyone not doing what you want. As you yourself admitted, the Suess situation isn't cancellation, so what's your problem? Just looking for an excuse to diarrhea spew your opinion on the internet?"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok I will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you don't know what is happening and why. Professional political censors working for radical left agencies demanded that Dr Seuss books be banned for samizdat, and so the trust managing the Seuss estate halted printing of the books. In addition, online market places like Ebay are banning private citizens from reselling their own private property. I can purchase and sell Mein Kampf on Ebay, I cannot purchase or sell my own private Dr Seuss collection on Ebay or my account will be suspended.

Hope I cleared that up for you. I recommend you actually look up things before you run your mouth on them. It's a minor inconvenience to explain these things, but you make yourself look unironically retarded when you do shitpost like this."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm gonna need a source for the estate listening to political censors.

Also, Ebay is one company. I think it's a bit of a stretch to turn one company being hypocritical and virtue signaling into a big communist conspiracy."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys should check out $gold. It hit 3 year 200 sma line and good hedge against inflation. It's also set to skyrocket with physical gold and silver being bought everywhere. It's not only a good value play but it's also a good play for fast growth.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm into the site's meta a bit, and this is the thing that I find intriguing. Over the last few years, Reddit has been more hands on with how subreddits are run (they'll mostly let you do what you want until you do something they don't like) and this will probably continue and increase as time goes on.

I don't know how much contact the admins have with the moderators of this sub, but they probably know this to some extent. Honestly, the fact that the admins tried to punish /u/zjz for speaking out about and for our community actually really pissed me off.

Glad the admins relented there, although I kinda doubt they had much of a choice and the mods here actually had a lot of leverage in this situation. Though again, the admins let the moderator team take the fall, so... I don't know.

Regardless, it's difficult to see it play out in a good way for our community long term.

I also think all of this is partially why we haven't had a second paper trading competition, despite it being a very popular idea.

Side note: The flair system needs to be enforced. I'd be willing to just retag posts for free*eeeeeee*.

Alternatively bring back drive ins.

Edit: with the money you save not burning it at movie theaters you can buy yourself surround sound and a projector."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"They said their MPDV will start at $33k. When they actually sell and deliver a version of it at that price, I will believe it. More like every other EV manufacturer their early models will cost significantly more with the cheaper models to start delivery at some future point. At this time it is an unproven vehicle from a company with no proof they can get to mass production.

The federal tax credit... Decent chance Biden and the democrats do something to offer it further for all EV's, so that is not going to help Canoo compete against Tesla, assuming that Tesla was competing in the vehicle class. Further, Tesla's 4680 cells in 2022 or 2023 (or probably later when Canoo maybe gets around to selling their vehicle before going bankrupt) will cost half, if not even less, then what Canoo will pay for the battery cells. So Canoo's 80 kWh battery pack will cost them $10K+ for the cells, while Tesla's cost will be half that amount for those cells. That plus greater economies of efficiency, will mean Tesla will not have any trouble competing with that missing $7,500 (not even getting into things like single-casting).

As to Canoo's skateboard completing crash testing, this is simply ridiculous. Canoo themselves said it is 70% of the crash safety components. This means that anything you build with it still needs to undergo crash testing. I mean, making up nonsense the company itself claims otherwise is just stupid.

Steer-by-wire - I mean on this alone anyone with a brain would short the stock. Maybe I should buy puts before Hindenburg sniffs this out, because it is a ref flag with an alarm that should warn investors away. Must jurisdictions make it illegal to not have direct linkage of the steering to the wheels. Please let us know how some start-up is going to change that! Tesla and others are all working on steer by wire, but there are significant issues with the technology. Number one, what happens if your power goes (I guess a similar question can be asked about self-driving... but with self-driving you need to show the technology is overall safer then people driving by a good margin, whereas steer by wire, is almost certainly less safer as it does not add anything safety wise)? Combined with brake by wire, you can't stop nor can you steer. The amount of proving before such technology will be legalized is going to be a major hurdle that I have not seen even talked about anyplace.

As to build quality issues with Tesla... Tesla in China is rated number 1. The main issues with Tesla in Fremont are panel gaps and cosmetic type issues. With the new factories and new builds (single casts..) I would expect Tesla's end of this year or next when they start production to improve in quality to the top of the pack.

As far as the stock price, no idea. Canoo can triple in value or more, until someone like Hindenburg comes out and takes apart the overstated beliefs or claims about them. Or maybe no, maybe they are legit and everything will work out. I would be very skeptical.

With $286M or so in assets and a market cap of $3.5, figure when investors lose hope in them, there is plenty of room for their share price to fall. The only reason I have not bought Puts is because they only got out to August. While I think it is pretty much a given their stock will tank eventually, I don't know if August is long enough time to give. On the other hand, well-known short firms are realizing that many EV stocks are a bubble (I was recently calling out Lordstown motor over their questionable in-wheel motor and guess what the other day Hindenburg takes them down), so probably just a matter of time before someone publicly takes them down.

Look, I am trying to be pragmatic, but reality is magic does not work. You will not be able to make money with EV's unless you put out superior vehicles that people want. There is limited battery supply, but there is not limited company's willing to make EV's. So if Canoo found a profitable niche, guess what, someone else will want to compete there and go to the same battery suppliers and offer them more money if there is profit to be made. Tesla's success is not going to be easy for anyone to replicate at any level.

Anyways, good luck with your investment. If I have some free cash, I will probably buy Puts on GOEV as I think that outcome is far more likely then success."

I work for a brokerage, so all of my loans/refinances are done through a wholesale lender.  I have not and will not likely ever work with Rocket.  Rocket is actively working to undermine brokers.  I will however jump through whatever hoops UWM puts up in order to work with them.  For a majority of my clients, UWM offers the best rates and by far (BY FAR) the best support.  I already take a .5% cut in commission by working with UWM as compared to other lenders and I'm perfectly OK with that.  I can guarantee you the vast majority of LOs feel the same exact way.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't see BABA going under $230 barring some very devastating news/a massive correlated tech sell-off, but if it does I'm BTFD out of that dip as much as possible."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you think the recent import tariffs will impact MOS and other US phosphate producers? Seems crazy bullish to me
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"DEFEND the gate!

People are donating to charities, oh no!!!!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,The new kids don‚Äôt know the rules.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,So total investment of $80?
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,No I paid 30/50 for the calls the total is higher
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Squeeze is just secondary.  Academy has been a good company for 30+ years.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a reddit command where a bot will message you after the specified time.

Cheers"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs for cunt. So I will remember üòÇüòÇ
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm retarded. Sorry for the comment.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,You need a bot for that ? Hhh
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have so much stuff that I dig through everyday on this app. I‚Äôm not going to remember this one random company that‚Äôs not a major priority for me, days from now. The hell you think the bot was made for üòÇüòÇ. Not everyone has the time or capacity to remember small details man. Why comment to me giving me shit about requesting a reminder. Fuck off bro."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Love you man. No hate in my comment
Bot reminder it is... And you'll call it random company when you see us on the moon in space suits üòú"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs a random company to me. I do daily plays and sometimes I forget one or two tickers and usually it‚Äôs the one I saw plenty of DD on why it would happen or how good of a play it was literally a day or 2 before it blows. Then I see posts about it blowing and check my history and see it was a ticker, post, or DD i was going to play and invest on but forgot. Now I‚Äôm going to start using reminders so that doesn‚Äôt happen again.  This seems interesting which is why I need the reminder. It will probably be one of my Monday or Tuesday plays after some DD today."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome onboard
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Week to two weeks
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure what your main thesis is, that CPNG will not become the next Amazon of the world? To be clear, I never argued against that sentiment. 

My main point is that CPNG will grow exponentially from where it is now, and there are many growth opportunities. 

They don't need to ""beat"" Netflix--as much as Amazon is not beating Netflix right now--to benefit from streaming revenue. Korean content is one of Netflix's top money makers. CPNG can take marketshare from that. 

CPNG has taken 2-years to match the market share of what took AMZN almost a decade, admittedly, because the team had the benefit of studying what AMZN did well. Moving forward, I believe an investor can gain more profits, and faster, on this IPO, than one would've done as a '97 Amazon investor over a three-five year time horizon. Again, it's all speculation, CPNG is a growth stock. I believe it'll grow."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I will get ready for it at 25 of the closing bell on Friday
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets, Well it‚Äôs real simple stay long till it hits 30 and sell
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Implemented it, [here's](https://github.com/WUSYF/Yeelight_StockPrices) the GitHub link.

But haven't tested it yet as it's weekend.."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hi, if you/your friend are still interested, I pushed the code to [GitHub](https://github.com/WUSYF/Yeelight_StockPrices)."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm using smart RGB bulbs (Yeelight). You can find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/WUSYF/Yeelight_StockPrices) if you'r interested.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm scraping Yahoo finance. You can take a look at the code [here](https://github.com/WUSYF/Yeelight_StockPrices) if you are interested.

03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"That would probably loose all my money.

LET'S DO IT!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,They are smart RGB bulbs (Xiaomi Yeelights) that can be controlled via wifi.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,[Here's](https://github.com/WUSYF/Yeelight_StockPrices) the link to GitHub.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGeEXrR84XE) the YT link.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Ty sir!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,[Here's](https://github.com/WUSYF/Yeelight_StockPrices) the GitHub link.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hi, little update: [Here's](https://github.com/WUSYF/Yeelight_StockPrices) the code!"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably. You can take a look at the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/WUSYF/Yeelight_StockPrices). It should be pretty easy to adapt it to Hue.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Never was.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,And look at how long TSLA stayed flat as fuck. And they are so much more than just an auto maker.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,What a fucking Stud!
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"The ""surprise"" makes me laugh out loud everytime üòÇ it's like mr bean comical"
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,is this on spotify
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll hold the milk
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,Total pothead friend almost died of covid.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm in GA too. When people talk about reopening I just laugh to myself.
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea I work retail. We have the mask signs but very few do it. Had a couple snowbirds today see them, say something, then turn around to get masks from the car. I was outside smoking, said ‚Äúit‚Äôs not enforced‚Äù, and they quickly went in."
03/14/2021,wallstreetbets,I manage a bar but we classify as a restaurant and because of this we never had to lower our capacity after reopening (we did anyway because it‚Äôs the right thing to do). We have actually be setting sales records during COVID operating at 70%. Younger clientele that could care less about the risks.
