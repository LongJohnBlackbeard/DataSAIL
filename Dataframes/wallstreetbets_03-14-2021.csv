2021-03-14 19:07:25,wallstreetbets,"Stockdale paradox: balance optimism and realism. Don’t assign dates when things will get better, but don’t lose faith that they will. I’ve seen this encouraging sentiment come up a bit more here regarding the GME squeeze: the biggest disheartening factor is people saying/believing the squeeze will come on __day of next week or on the <date> of <month>. What happens is that day passes and it’s just another reason to paperhands. It reminded me of the Stockdale paradox so I figured I’d post it:

https://innovationandcreativityinstitute.com/stockdale-paradox/

>	“You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end—which you can never afford to lose —with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be.”
~ James Stockdale

Yeah it’s hokey, but those that assign a date to their “rescue” are going to be more likely to bail or break when that date comes and goes, even though they are just as sure it will come as someone who believes but doesn’t assign a date.

Do yourself a favor and believe your own conclusions (however you come to them), but don’t kid yourself with an exact date or range of dates. No one knows. And even if there’s the strongest evidence, there have been shenanigans in the past and they’ll come again."
2021-03-14 19:00:09,wallstreetbets,"I explain things to idiots, part 2: Puts, and a couple clarifications about Calls. Yesterday I made a post explaining calls, which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4a87a/i_teach_high_school_which_means_i_explain_things/).  In it, I said I'd explain puts later.  It's later, so I'm explaining them below.  I also had a lot of people ask me further questions about selling calls, so after I talk about puts, I'm going to cover some of that info to clear up confusion.  Assuming this goes as well as the last one, maybe I'll do one more post about options, in which I'll talk about writing calls/puts, and maybe go into a little more detail about the Greeks and how options are priced and valued.  We'll see. 

Moving forward, if you didn't read yesterday's post, then the first thing you should do is read that, because I'm going to use terminology and refer to concepts that were explained in that post.

**WHAT IS A PUT OPTION**

If a call is a bet that that a stock is going to go up, then a put option (hereafter referred to as a ""put"") is a bet that a stock is going to go down.  Like a call, a put is contract involving 100 shares.  However, instead of giving you the ability to buy 100 shares of stock at the strike price, a put option gives you the ability to sell 100 shares of stock at the strike price.

Example:  Let's say that GME is trading at $300, and you think it is going to tank.  You can buy a put option for $100, and if the price of GME drops below $100, you're ITM.

**HOW DO PUTS WORK?**

The same way as calls.  You buy them the same way, you pay for them the same way (premiums), you sell them the same way if you don't want to exercise (more on this later, as selling your contracts was the most common question I got yesterday), and they are impacted by theta decay and IV the same way.

One key difference is the exercising of a put option, which we'll look at in a second.  Other than that, there isn't much more to put here.  If you understand calls, then you understand puts.  Beyond exercising, the only real difference is that you are betting on the price to go down instead of up.

**CAN YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE ANYWAY?  I WAS LYING WHEN I SAID I UNDERSTOOD CALLS.**

Sure.

Let's say that GME is trading at $300, and you think the the hedgies are winning and the squeeze is over.  Or maybe you think that the squeeze is going to squoze next week, and after that the price is going to drop once everyone takes their profits.  Regardless, by 3/26, you think that the price will drop back down to $40 or lower.

So you buy an $8.32 GME 100p 3/26.  Do we remember what that means and how much it costs?  It means you spent $832 for the right to sell 100 shares of GME for $100 on or before 3/26.

Now you wait.  If 3/26 comes and goes and the price never drops, then your option expires OTM.

But if you were correct and the price does drop below $100, then you are ITM and have a choice to make.  You can sell the contract or exercise it.

**OK, SO HOW IS EXERCISING A PUT DIFFERENT THAN EXERCISING A CALL**

If you choose to exercise a call, you have one option: buy the shares.  When exercising a put, you have three options.

1.  If you already have 100 shares of GME (maybe you missed the peak and are holding a bag), then exercising the put is as easy as making the option writer buy your shares.  You give them 100 shares of GME, and they give you $10,000 ($100/share x 100 shares).  

2.  If you don't have 100 shares of GME, then you can buy 100 shares for whatever the stock price is (if it dropped all the way to $40, then you'd buy them for $40) and then sell them to the option writer for $100 share.  That's dumb.  Don't do that.

3.  If you think it has farther to fall (and you have a margin account), you can enter a short position.  You borrow 100 shares and sell them to the option writer for $100, then you wait and buy them back later to replace the shares you borrowed.  That's big dumb.  Don't do that either.

Really, though, you should be selling your contracts instead of exercising, because exercising contracts throws away any extrinsic value you may have built (see below).  Plus, you probably don't want and can't afford 100 shares of whatever stock you have options on.

**THE PART WHERE I TALK ABOUT SELLING YOUR OPTION CONTRACTS AND ANSWER SOME COMMON QUESTIONS AND HOPEFULLY DO A BETTER JOB THAN LAST TIME.  I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT PUTS AND CALLS BOTH HERE.**

*First, let's talk about value and taking advantage of that value to sell for profit.*

We talked about this a little yesterday, but you need to make sure you understand that your option has value from when you buy it until it expires, and that you can use that value to make money.  Does that mean it has value even when it's OTM?  Yes, even OTM options have value (see: extrinsic value from yesterday).  Why?  Because people buy OTM contracts.  In fact, OTM contracts can even make you money while still OTM.  Did you buy a $400c when the stock price was $100?  If the stock price gets to $350, you may be OTM, but your $400c contract can be worth more now than it was when you bought it (assuming there is time left before expiration and theta isn't killing you).  But how can you buy an OTM contract and then sell that same contract for profit when it is still OTM?  Remember the premiums.  When people buy options, they pay the option seller a premium to buy that contract.  The premium on a way OTM contract is going to be very cheap.  The premium on a ""near the money"" contract that is that has time to spare is going to be higher.  If you buy that contract when it is way OTM and sell it when it is near the money, the price the buyer gives you could be higher than the price you paid to the seller, which equals profit.  The same is true of a put.  If you buy a $100p when the share price is $400, you'll be able to sell that contract for a profit if the price drops to $150 (again, assuming you aren't running out of time.  Time is a big deal.  Seriously.  I'll talk about that later).

On the other hand, an OTM option that is running out of time and not even close to strike (or hasn't move appreciably since bought) isn't going to have as much value as it did when you bought, and any sale would be at a loss.  But remember that you can still sell it even if it is losing.

ITM options always have value because they are worth the difference between the stock price and strike (remember intrinsic value?), which can't be zero if the stock is trading above strike.

*So when can I sell my contract?*

Anytime.  You can sell it ITM, OTM, or ATM (at the money, which means the stock is trading at the strike price.  I don't think we talked about ATM options yesterday).  Are you approaching expiration and the stock is trading sideways and you don't think you're going to hit the strike before time runs out?  You can sell it and cut your losses.  Did the stock spike deep ITM but you think it's going to crash back down?  Sell that thing and realize some profit.

*Who determines the price of a contract?  Who determines the premiums?  Do I set the premiums when I sell my contract?*

The premium/value of a contract is determined by an arcane combination of factors, including time to exercise, strike price, stock price, volatility, and others.  There is a lot of Greek involved.  There may be actual magic involved, too.  Either way, the price is set for you and you don't have to worry about it.  

*But who's going to buy my contract?  If nobody ever wants to execute, then who ends up with all the calls?  If nobody has shares to sell, who ends up with all the puts?*

I was surprised at how many people asked me this question.  The short answer is that it doesn't matter.  Someone will buy your contract.  The medium answer is that it could be individuals, institutions, or the market maker absorbing the trade if no one else will.  Regardless, calls/puts that weren't offset will be exercised by some entity or other.  In the case of calls, if they didn't want the shares, they'll just sell them.  In the case of puts, if they didn't have the shares to sell, then they'll buy them.

*If I sell my contract to someone else, am I on the hook when they exercise?*

No.  The writer, or the person who created the contract and first sold it, is the only person who will be on the end of an exercise.  If you write a call that goes ITM, then you can get assigned and have to cough up some shares.  If you bought a call and then sold it when it went ITM, then you don't have to sell any shares to cover.  If you want to learn about writing calls/puts, then maybe I'll do that next time.

*What if I don't sell my ITM option when it expires?*

It depends on the brokerage and whether or not you have a margin account.  Your brokerage will either exercise them, sell the contract for you, or let it expire.

*So what is the deal with time, then?  Or, when should I sell my contract?*

Time, which is referred to and measured as theta, plays a big part in the extrinsic value (or potential, as we talked about yesterday) of an option.  The closer you get to expiration, the faster theta decay (the loss of value due to time) is going to increase, and the faster you are going to start losing value.  In fact, there can be instances in which the stock price goes up, but your option value still goes down because theta decay is eroding value faster than the other pricing factors are increasing value.  For this reason, you generally don't want to wait until expiration to sell a call, and should have a plan to do so earlier.  Theta Decay is real.

*So when is ""earlier?""*

There are too many factors for the valuation of each option to give you a standard time to sell.

**IN CONCLUSION**

If you think a stock is going to go up, buy a call.  If you think it's going to go down, buy a put.  Sell your contracts.  Don't exercise them.  Don't wait until the last minute.  You have nothing to lose but your ~~chains~~ premiums.

That's most of what I can think of to say about the basics of buying/selling options.  Is there more to it than that?  Yes, but adding it in here will make it too long and too technical, and more articles that are too long and too technical aren't going to help people who are struggling to get the basics.  As I said above, I might do one last options post about writing contracts and maybe covering the Greeks.  We'll see.  Regardless, it won't be today or tomorrow.  Maybe next weekend.

I hope this all was helpful."
2021-03-14 18:43:20,wallstreetbets,Took 45k and bought six April $145 calls. After making about 101k rotated the contracts for July expiration. Currently down on the new contracts but I am confident will rocket this week. 
2021-03-14 18:38:04,wallstreetbets,"Portfolio plan for the months/quarters ahead | in context of yield, inflation and interest rates (Open to criticism if you think I am wrong or disagree) I am not a financial advisor and the below is my personal assessment of how things could unfold in the coming few months/quarters. And based on my assessment, I have tried to draw up a plan which I think might work in generating decent return with low to medium portfolio downside risk. This is not particularly a WSB-ish post, just because I am trying to not go full retard with my money.

Assumptions:
1. Fed to keep interest rate low till 2023
2. More fiscal spend in the coming months involving trillions of dollars

Let me start by saying that we don't need to figure out whether we will have inflation in the near future or not. Let the bond market speculate on that. We just need to follow the bond market and its expectation of inflation. That's all we need to do in order to allow ourselves a better chance to make money right now.

If the bond market's inflation expectation goes up from here, so will the 10Y yield. If the bond market's expectation of inflation goes down or remain as it is right now, the 10Y will remain where it is or will go down.

Note: at 1.6 yield (current yield) one would only buy a 10Y if they estimate that long term inflation is going to be less than 1.6.

If the yield goes up from here, tech or broadly speaking Nasdaq will continue to struggle further. And value stocks such as financials, energy companies, consumer discretionary will continue to outperform.

If yield remains where it is, expect tech to bounce back in the medium term, but value stocks will still remain the favorites.

If yield goes down, which would be a surprise, tech will climb back rapidly and value stocks will probably experience a correction, since they have already run up a lot in the last few months.

I personally think there is a greater chance of yield going higher from here, so being in value stocks or reopening stocks makes more sense to me.

However, since there is always the off chance that we experience runaway inflation, I think it would just be wise to hold perhaps 15% of your portfolio in inflation hedges such as REIT, or in a commodity ETF.

If real inflation actually rises in the next couple of quarters, Fed might or might not raise interest rates immediately.

If Fed doesn't raise interest rates and lets inflation run up, it might do so because the Fed might believe it is a short term phenomenon. Anyway, if inflation does run hot above 2% targeted, expect 10Y to shoot up.

In a higher than expected inflation environment, equities usually underperform, historically. Tech definitely would not be the place to be in. Safe bets would involve: consumer staples, energy and utility companies. These are considered safe because these industries could pass on their costs to the consumer, so their operating margin doesn't get impacted. Financials would also do well if this scenario plays out, because their net interest income would improve, because of steepening yield curve.

Commodities should also outperform during this scenario because high inflation will drive up the prices of agricultural products, livestock products - gold and silver will become attractive as store of value, property prices will go up (REIT).

In this scenario perhaps you should start building position in the dollar (cash) and also be equally weighted between commodities/property and stocks (financials/utilities/consumer staple).

If Fed raises interest rate as a response to rising inflation, it will do so because Fed wants to cool down the overheating economy.

In this scenario of rising interest rates, expect dollar to bottom and for it to surge as long as interest rates remain high. Commodities and REIT will underperform. Stocks will experience stagnate return or maybe even a bear market. If so, your built up cash position in dollar should probably go into buying the dip of attractive companies."

2021-03-14 18:18:31,wallstreetbets,"Melvin, Citadel, and Point 72 (GME) I’m long on GME and enjoying this crazy ride with all of you fellow 🦍. Thank you to everyone on this community and especially those who have done some incredible DD over the last couple months. This has been one hell of a roller coaster ride. I’m proud of you 💎 hands that held through Wednesday. 

I believe in both the gamma and short squeeze. The recovery from last Wednesday and to be holding this price integrity with such low volume in the last couple trading days has been encouraging. I obviously would have liked to see more of a bump on Friday 3/12 to trigger the heavily bought expiring 300 call options. 

In reviewing all the DD, I’m really only questioning two things, of which only one can be answered. 

1. I’ve seen a lot of calcs on the actual number of naked short shares needed to cover. IMO - These numbers vary significantly and with the resources available is probably only conjecture and to be seen upon the conclusion of this squeeze.

2. MY MAIN QUESTION (AND REASON FOR THIS POST). We know Melvin was down 53% in January due to the first GME squeeze. They testified before congress these shares were covered. Citadel and Point 72 since have invested $3 billion in Melvin with an agreement for future revenue sharing. Why would they open themselves up to this type of capital exposure to a firm who’s teetering on the brink of bankruptcy? Especially if the intent was to double down and short GME again to recover these losses. Wouldn’t Citadel and Point 72 been better off letting Melvin fail and taking their own capital and shorting GME? I know the CEO of Melvin used to work for Citadel, but I just struggle with this ideology. Furthermore the SI (short interest) in GME has fallen by 50% since the first squeeze in January (correct me with exact numbers).

Again, I’m long on GME and not trying to be a FUD... But if anyone has thoughts on how these hedgies operate, please enlighten my poor ape intellect!

See y’all on the moon! I’ll be the guy in the mullet handing out wife beaters.

2021-03-14 18:06:09,wallstreetbets,"$RIDE with me: DD, Lordstown 

Quick recap last week Hindenburg yes we all know them and if you don't do some of your own DD made a short report on Lordstown motors $RIDE
This made the stock fall to $15 per share which is down 50% from ATH
Lordstown is one of the most legitimate EV companies out there. A major partnership with multiple companies like camping world and GM. This is one of the worst-hit pieces I've seen.

First off fuck short sellers. Lordstown motors is a truck company that is bringing much-needed manufacturing jobs to the Midwest US FUCKING A This is an American company hiring people in a struggling city so anyone who shorts this stock is simply anti-America. Seriously fuck you for profiting from the losses in small American manufacturing city's. Even if you don't think Lordstown is a good investment is is outrageously toxic to make money on the failure of fellow Americans.

This hit claimed multiple things that I will now assess 

Edit*: for all you retards that can't read in the comments find me an OEM EV company that has binding pre-orders I dare you.

1) there is no demand.
Claiming there is no demand for an electric EV truck is insane. EV is the future and trucks are part of that by claiming there is no demand makes no sense and it's as simple as that. the tesla cybertruck has 400k preorders and I am sorry tesla retards but your local plumber, an energy company, and farmer jack arent buying a cybertruck. The real bros of silicon valley will buy the shit out of cybertucks so they can use them to live in because they can't afford rent but ain't no real truck work is getting done in a cybertruck.

3) the truck doesn't work
There are many videos of working prototypes not rolling downhill that can be easily found with a basic Google search these guys are probably using internet explore and bing search engine to do their DD or they're just blind. The Endurance truck is entered into a 250-mile rally in April and will be competing. Why the hell would you enter a race if your truck doesn't even work no one could be that dumb. The truck did have some issues as one of the prototypes caught on fire but the keyword is a prototype. Yes, no way I didn't know that experimental prototypes fail a lot of that's the whole reason prototyping exists.

5) preorders are fake
No, they aren't they are not binding pre-orders that is true but name one EV company with binding pre-orders even teslas cyber tuck can be ""pre-ordered"" with a non-binding $100 check so don't try and argue this is any different no one in their right mind would lock into a binding contract with any new EV company and no one has.

This report has caused RIDE short interest to shoot straight up and if a prefect candidate for WSBs good olde fashioned short squeeze to the moon.

The bull case. I grew the biggest testies and doubled down on this bad boy during the dip last Friday. my position 350 shares 5 long 2022 $30 calls. Mostly all bought on Friday

1) All pre-orders are for commercial use, the 100k preorders are from companies to use as fleet vehicles and they do plan to work into the consumer market after they ramp production more.

2) They own and will produce in the Lordstown plant previously owned by GM which already has a 500k car per year capacity

3) I agree with your take on autonomy I think it is vital to an EV company and this is very speculative GM who has the cruise Autonomous driving system is a pretty big investor in Lordstown and the CEO of Lordstown says they have a great relationship and want to expand their relationship with GM. So I would assume sometime down the road this could mean the integration of the cruise system in Lordstown trucks.

4) The Price, in your video you said you think rivan and Lordstown are kind of competing, I think this is a bit of a mistake, first rivan is a consumer-first company where Lordstown is mostly in the commercial space (right now) and Rivan vehicles will cost much more than Lordstown. I grew up and still do live in the city of Detroit and follow the automotive sector. I know a lot about rivian being that they have an office here in Plymouth Michigan. Their cars and trucks have a more premium price and the Lordstown truck is only going to cost about 50k which is pretty good considering normal gas truck prices. The rivan will be more in the 70k range.

5) This is an obvious Biden play Made in the US in the midwest (Ohio) a state that democrats barely lost, this would be a great PR political move to hype this company up just to get more Democratic support in the state and the midwest all together

Finally

6) partnership with RV world, they recently partnered with RV world to act as a place to service their vehicles, as we know when Tesla first came out and still to this day have issues servicing the cars. This partnership means that the day the first endurance truck rolls off the line there will be hundreds of locations around the US where technicians are already trained to work and fix these trucks, not to mention that both CEOs mentioned in their joint press conference that there is a goal to electrify 5th wheel trailers to help increase EV trucks long road trip range and build EV RVs.

Thanks for reading my ted talk I typed this on my phone so fuck you if there are any typos I'm not fixing that shit.

2021-03-14 17:43:39,wallstreetbets,"This sub has helped revive me(thank you) A few months ago, I was in a state of abject despair. I had been through two horrible/extremely heartbreaking relationships back to back, lost my job due to COVID-19(was living on unemployment and savings), I had developed a neck beard nest, was borderline suicidal, sleeping 12+ hours per day, etc. I had no interest in anything but smoking weed, jacking off, and sleeping.

Then, in December, I started following the GME stuff(didn’t have much to invest myself sadly), which lead to a deeper interest in the stock market, etc. I would wake up every day pre market(I had no sleep schedule before so this was big for me) and just sit there and watch various stocks and read discussion. It got addictive and I would be reading for 8 hour long sessions at times. I got more and more into it, to the point where I was reading books about the market(I hadn’t read a book in two years before) and just generally having not depressing thoughts all the time. I got a job in January, but continued basically spending all my free time either stressing about bullshit or reading about the market/looking at charts. At this point, I had begun investing a little money which made it even more interesting. Eventually, around beginning February, I was started to feel back to my normal self somewhat. Still scarred, like not at all ready for love again and scared I will slip back into depression(still have some really low days), but also my interests were coming back, I was having energy again, I was wanting to see/make friends again. 

Now, in March, shit is pretty much back to normal. I now am maybe not as obsessed with the market(some of my other hobbies started to come back like philosophy, tv and movies...I seriously went 6 months without viewing a movie or tv show because I was that depressed lol) but still looking at it every day and actually working on my own SQL project for stock screening. But just wanted to thank this community for proving a catalyst to get me back to normal. I didn’t need drugs, just needed lots of charts for my smooth brain to enjoy.

They sold a call, so when the stock goes up, they lose money on the call.

They buy just enough stock so that they make exactly as much from the stock as they lose on the call.

So they neither make, nor lose anything.

If delta is .5, then for every $1 the stock goes up, the call goes up 50 cents per share. To break even then, the market maker needs to own 50 shares for every call contract.

If 50 shares go up $1 each, then the market maker makes $50 on the stock, and because delta is .5, they lose $50 on the call contract.

When delta changes to 0.6, the market maker needs to buy 10 more shares so they own 60 shares so they make $60 on the stock when they lose $60 on the contract.

**Canoo Inc. AKA $GOEV** is an EV automaker whose claim to fame is developing a highly customizable electric skateboard chassis allowing it to quickly adapt vehicle designs to specific applications with a high degree of customizability. They seek to break the mold by pushing design boundaries while maximizing utility and advancing new concepts in vehicle ownership through subscription based models of vehicle financing and fleet management.  Canoo Inc also excels at punishing the visionary longs as you must wait for 3 months outside the temple of Zen before they let you in **No more suffering GOEV only tendies and gainz posting now.**

# Trend Reversal = No More Dryspell

Recently SPACS and EVs fell out of favor as macro market headwinds took the air out of Tech and Growth sails.  With a large amount of EV's being suspected of being Vaporware including the Pink Elephant in the room TSLA, Capital ran from these stocks faster than your Sunday morning retreat from that pig shaped MOPED you don't want your friends to see you riding.  This all came back to a stunning reversal of fortune after Warren Buffet said Yield Curve is so 1920's and everything is fine, stop being a bitch.  FED said QE forever boys and I'll let you know when I stop buying mortgages people haven't paid for since the pandemic started. Cool Bro, so Last week we saw capital come back to growth and tech stocks acting like nothing happened because they have a nice personality and tend to bang well. You know what I'm mean.

This saw our beloved GOEV take its gloves off (and its pants) and fight like it had a pair.  There's a short squeeze taking place that I have written about extensively.  The stock price immediately reversed its course and has continued to appreciate dramatically based on the electric magnetism of a gamma ramp. Friday the empire struck back and then we gave everyone fuck tons of free money. BullHood and his best friend WeRobbin' is going to turn this market into Burning Man meets 28 days later. Strap in.

For real though Canoo spent this week as the darling of the EV class.  Not only did its [SP](https://u.teknik.io/nkXjb.PNG) outperform every other fucking EV maker out there. If there wasn't the Friday Short shenannigans this week the SP would have dominated them all from the moon.  I believe that we are seeing the emergence of the Tesla Hedge. Canoo is, in my opinion, strategically grabbing market share while staying out of the way of direct competition with luxury EV models. Its doing its own thing.

# Hypermasculine BubbleTruk drop dominates automotive world.

[BubbleTruk](https://u.teknik.io/ikfDb.jpg) was so fucking weird.  People had a strong feeling about it, hating or loving it... No one ignored it. Media has shifted significantly into covering Canoo's Electric Truck Release (Did fisker even do anything at MPG ?)  [Google news overflowing](https://u.teknik.io/44XGk.jpg) with articles in the past 3 days. Probably some pay to play, but whatever.  Check the plenty of articles with titles calling the Bangbus as a TSLA competitor.  That belief will be self fulfilling.  We are currently standing at the base of a significant change in perception [a trend reversal](https://u.teknik.io/4Zo6x.PNG) that will have long lasting positive consequences to valuation.  But competing with Tesla is not the only thing on Canoo's mind, Canoo seeks to corner the entire fucking truck market.  Lets compare.

**Canoo hasn't been this cool always.**  I watched the MPDV vehicle video and succeeded in not suck starting a pistol but only barely.  In fact, If I was long in GOEV and that video dropped, I would have by now.  Its clear that the CannooBro's fanbase has only survived because of California's strict gun legislation.

I am highly encouraged by Electric ChadTruk video because everything about it was better. The presentation, the lighting the guest, the reality of its presence.  There was something just so dominant about it where Canoo just showed versus explained to me why I should think its cool. Tony talked about taking his significant other out and his Guys on the jobsite.  This offends the westcoast hipster elite.  Listen, the fact that he didn't say ""My arm candy sextoy never drives"" means he's paying attention to the Mandatory Training PowerPoint slides. The MPDV felt like a joke you have to explain... like your portfolio's performance before last Monday.   This level of difference is indicative of serious corporate flexibility and an ability to create meaningful change when you miss your target.  Its not all wins but its how you roll with the punches that matters. 

**Let me put it to you like this, you didn't know you wanted that truck until you saw the video.** 

# That stinks like Steve Jobs.

After being involved in stocks with ETF exposure (read: **Every single other stock out there**)  I can appreciate that we will only be going up versus blaming all of our losses on ""ETF shorting"".  Depending on the catalyst that brings that exposure we could see millions of shares being scooped up. Note the comparable amount of the rest of comparable stocks. Somewhere between Nio and Fisk is 10 percent of our FF.  Just saying.

In other news, Cathie Wood is excited about the Canoo truck because she will finally be able to fit all of Ark's Short Interest in the back without having to fold the seat down.  The only problem is that the 200 mile range might not be enough to find the share price at the bottom of the chart.  She's just a attention grabbing vaporware empty bag holdin... Wait what? What? **Breaking news!** Ark picked us up..

She's a **genius**. Truly visionary with her approach.

**Imminent Trend Reversal**

# Monday is Roth , Partner Announcement would be cool.

They could announce something and really just fucking make everyone who boarded this party train in the last 4 days so fucking rich its disgusting or longs break even.  I'm just kidding, they're going to be rich too. Especially people with warrants.  They are going to get the nursing home bed next to the window.

But lets be real and get to know the **bear perspective.**

/u/Dramatic-Trainer-268

""Roth could end up being fruitful, but it'd be the first time they released material info at a conference/round table like this since I started following them And since they revealed the MPDV in Dec they've been stone fucking silent So I worry they're going to drag their feet on providing any new info before 4/16And the only reason I think they'd hold those numbers for an extended period of time is if they weren't as good as they wanted them to be prior to announcing them Few weeks after revealing MPDV and opening up US pre-orders, they opened it up to Canada and Mexico too. Out of the blue. Felt like they wanted to juice the numbers.$100 deposit, fully refundable, so people will hate on them being true pre-orders""

He's actually super bullish and literally knows everything about Canoo Inc.  he just wants you to know that its not all shits and giggles.  I'm wondering about earnings too... Its like were at the action sequence of the movie and we just got done killing the monster, but there's still 30 minutes left in the film.  Nevertheless I'm feeling good.

I want to end with some wild speculation from the man that leaked the ChadTruk in the first place.

/u/PlaneReflection

""I’m speculating that Walmart will purchase a fleet of MPDVs for Walmart+ deliveries.

* \-Paul B mentioned “retailers like Walmart” several times.
* \-MPDV is the cheapest cargo van, electric or gas, on the market.
* \-MPDV has the greatest cargo volume for its footprint, meaning more deliveries in less trips.
* \-Canoo’s phone-as-a-key and fleet management software provides much better integration, than any other vehicle.
* \-EVs make sense from a fleet perspective as minimal maintenance, no dealing with gas cards, can charge at Walmart sites and etc.
* \-Canoo Lifestyle vehicle was coincidentally spotted charging at a Walmart in Arizona on [Twitter](https://u.teknik.io/4ImZF.PNG):""

2021-03-14 12:27:57,wallstreetbets,"GME: A game of Tug O' War You vs the hedgies

If you pull hard enough you get 1000 banana, if they manage to get your grip loose and win, they get your 1 banana. Seems fair because risk vs reward of going against several opponents by yourself balances it out. But it doesn't, the hedgies are using every trick disposable to them to get you to loosen your grip; they let go of the rope for a bit and then let the big fat anchor hedgie pull as soon as you try to gain ground. Yet you do not falter.

Why? Because you are an ape. An ape knows they are not alone in this cause, they simply tighten their grip and HOLD onto their dear lives. The hedgies continue and continue but not a single whiff of your banana is in their grasp. Eventually after all their tricks, their pussy hands are bleeding- they cannot hold on anymore. You pull forward and one by one the hedgies fall and the 1000 bananas they owe are yours...

But you do not let go of the rope. No no, in fact you tighten your grip and HOLD and pull like you've never before. The hedgies have been screwing with you this whole time. All their dirty tricks, you want to make them pay. As you keep pulling the rope, and the last chungus of a hedgie falls, you notice that their rope does not end. In fact it is an endless rope full of bananas along the way. You pull and HOLD and pull and HOLD and you keep getting more and more bananas. 2000, 5000, 10000, 50000, it just keeps going and going. Eventually you take your fill of bananas and decide to leave as a bananillionaire!

You were able to squeeze the hell out of the rope because you knew 1000 was not enough. Because you held, you got many, many more bananas than you thought was possible.

This is not financial advice, I simply like allegories.

In this article, the author tries to conflate put options with short selling. They claim short selling has an expiration date and that the hedge funds were forced to cover because their put options were expiring.

That isn't how this shit works.

I've only just started trading options, but even \*I\* know if you buy put options you're only risking the premium you pay. If the stock moons, your options just expire worthless and you're out the premium that you paid.

How in the nine hells of journalistic malpractice did this actually get published?

The author then says the trading activity was all bots and that social media is a threat.

Author is the CEO of some cloud bullshit who has no clue about investing or options gambling.

(1) Fractional shares don't have voting rights. 

     You might ask, ""why should I give a shit?"" Well, for example, if you are invested in GME right now, there is an annual shareholders meeting coming in June and there will be very important measures that will be voted on then. Your vote, no matter how small, can have an effect on the company's future in the coming years. 

(2) You are giving instituions money to buy shares to loan out to hedge funds who want to short. 

    You heard that right. Fractional shares are backed by real shares held by some institution somewhere. You think they will let those shares sit there? Fuck no, they will loan them out so they can get that juicy 1% interest on money they didn't even put down in the first place. 

TL;DR: Buy a whole share if you can and exersice your shareholder rights and screw the 🩳

* To be added to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in April. If this is relative to other brands they could jump almost 100% in stock price over the months following the addition to that exchange.
* William Li met with Sinopec (second largest Oil Company and owner of 30,000+ gas stations) in early February. During NIO day William Li announced a second gen battery station. This potential partnership would create battery swap stations at a butt load of Sinopec gas stations. Huge ENERGY profits not just vehicle profits.
* PT at $60 from Mizuho and $70 from Deutsche Bank.
   * PLAY FOR LEAP CALL OPTIONS and simply more shares

* Stock is crazy hyped. Mainline that stimmy money plus Cathie Wood continuing to buy so why in the fuck have I been jerking off and not buying. My wife’s boyfriend is very disappointed in me.
   * Shares entry \~$25ish
   * Short Term Calls for YOLO sake

* TD Ameritrade is not allowing for short positions of GME or RKT at this time so all the bears can get fucked

* Maybe the wholesale ultimatum doesn't mean shit to RKT but it at least seemed like some petty shit I was down with. Could be a big swing in price either way with those going into effect 3/15
* Being listed on new indexes on March 22
* Short interest seems to be around 11%
   * Low entry price \~$9 a share so could have for a longer hold to see if anything pops

2021-03-14 09:00:18,wallstreetbets,"SPY $400. Technical analysis for the week ahead for ""beginners"". Not a trading advise.

Following on my comment earlier today, I asked if there was any interest in some bullshit TA for next week since the entire WSB front page is full of legit DD including all kind of mammal pictures. 

I’m going to keep it as clean and simple as I can using area charts instead of candles. I believe support and resistances are better visible this way. It should help beginners see these levels at first sight. 

**Part I - Bull cases:**

**SPY**

Peaked through resistance and held. Common thought was resistance at 394.xx ATH while I drew my resistance line at 392.50 earlier last week. It held above 392.50 Thursday, resistance became support and whaddaya know a sharp bounce at 392.50 Friday intraday, turning green. Opened a new position on that support confirmation. 3/19 400c. If you're interested in learning charts, I recommend taking an actual look at the chart below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aim6y6vuzwm61.jpg?width=1548&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f63851b772f2bbf8cc7fd3a5cccd38d4d6f9c95f

**Bull Scenario A:**

SPY opens red and tests 392.50-393 Monday again, holds and closes above 396. If this plays out, we’re likely see the 400 breach Tuesday intraday. I won’t be spooked by the Monday dip. Might actually add. 

**Bull Scenario B:**

No repetitive back test. Face ripping rally above 400. 

Who would think folks will get their stimmy this weekend and the forbidden digital asset will trade above $60K? Honestly guys, this was kinda obvious. Not saying retail is single-handedly causing this. In my opinion, institutions anticipating this move is behind the $60K breach. I bet if we look at today’s buying blocks next week, we will see double digit unit purchases dominating fraction buys. This will be the confirmation of institution involvement, bringing retail inside.

Anyway,

$60K+, VIX potential $20 break down, QQQ short term bottom(?) and current market momentum pointing SPY 400 Monday. Many more detailed indicators (Bullish MACD cross overs, call/put ratios, percentage of tickers above 200 moving average inside SPY etc.) supporting this but explaining them without a video is not practical. 

Continuing on scenario B...Test 402 Monday intraday, rejection, test 404 (actual resistance) Tuesday and a sharp rejection. This is where I’m hoping to exit my 400c position and go short term 🌈🐻. Monday closing above 400 (or not) will be the deciding factor. 

**VIX**

Fellas this part is important. Spend some time on the chart below. VIX is very close to the infamous $20 support. Last time that support was tested, bears raped EVERYONE. They took no prisoners. I’d like to point out that last time it was under 20 was **more than a year ago.** Rules apply. VIX goes up, stocks goes down and vice versa. AKA fear indicator. If VIX goes below 20, which is a big event, **Bull Scenario B** will apply 100%.

https://preview.redd.it/e7kms0qy2xm61.jpg?width=1550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=743d02ae122887214dbfcf976d2ffbb2a7f4aa0b

**QQQ**

I think we’ve all learned the last 3 weeks that portfolio diversification is a real thing 🙃 

While QQQ is still sitting at a bear territory, it showed signs of a likely short term bottom. Mighty 323 resistance (double top) and 311 is the VERY important support. I believe it’s going to follow the rest of the crowd, breaking key resistances at 318 and 323. I will be on the look out for 318+ Monday premarket for confirmation. If so, above **Bull Scenario A or B** likely apply, thus giving bears little to no early hope.

**TSLA**

While 700 resistance is obvious, i believe 720 is much more important. 

In above Bull Scenario A, TSLA tests 688 support, bounces and close above 705. Tuesday tests 720 for real for real and hard rejection.

In above Bull Scenario B, pre-market 700+ straight up, taking advantage of pre-market low volume (I believe it did this at 800 as well) and blasts through 720. This level is where I’m hoping to exit my 3/19 700 calls. 

**TNX 10 YEAR TREASURY NOTE YIELD**

I want to cover this part in another post under bear cases. I think bears gonna love mid next week. I will be shorting financials and oil. 

If this was informative, let me know and I’ll continue tomorrow holding a big ass bear flag for Part II."

My assumption is that retail investors aren’t doing a lot of short selling; the hedge funds and investment banks are, and they have untold billions in their fuckery budgets. We have more individual investors, they have more dollars. 

But while I have a rough mental estimate of the size of the WSB crowd, I have no sense of the number of institutional players. Recognizing that they’re all encrusted to their come-encrusted titties, how many firms do you think are pursuing a strategy of heavily shorting GME? 

Are we up against ten firms? 100? 1000?"

2021-03-14 07:05:39,wallstreetbets,"Potential (inevitable?) $MVIS buyout **Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Do your own research before making any investment. I am biased due to holding MVIS shares.**

MVIS had an earnings call on Thursday during which the CEO Sumit Sharma was noticeably excited and mentioned that the company was for sale several times, including direct quote “In conclusion, we remain committed to exploring synergic alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company, in part or whole, to maximize value for our shareholders.”

Here is a transcript of the call: [https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/34950d17-39cc-4cdc-87c6-b6714a06b89a](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/34950d17-39cc-4cdc-87c6-b6714a06b89a)

And here is the audio from the call: [https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/48120c74-0702-4285-bfd9-e8334da64933](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/48120c74-0702-4285-bfd9-e8334da64933)

I’m not going to post any DD because there’s already a bunch of amazing DD over at r/MVIS. I suggest you check it out.

There’s been speculation by longtime MVIS holders of a buyout for quite some time now due to their LiDAR (their product) being used in Microsoft’s HoloLens, but since LiDAR is also getting hyped as the technology that will make self-driving cars possible, some other players have emerged as potential partners / buyers. Again, check out all the DD on r/MVIS.

I’m posting this because WSB has changed my life. The only reason I have any money to invest is because of ideas from this subreddit and I want to pay it forward by contributing to the knowledge base. For anyone trying to find solid DD, sifting through all the posts, maybe not being able to afford something as expensive as GME - this is for you. I strongly believe in MVIS and think a buyout resulting in a huge jump in share price is coming. Good luck to all!

2021-03-14 06:16:03,wallstreetbets,"NIO - Bull-case investment Thesis, plus Crazy OG-style WSB ""Bet"" Smart Nio investors trade on catalysts. If you guys read my DD on NIO before the NIO Day Catalyst, you would've bought in at 38 and sold around 60 (I sold calls, but still holding my shares).

Now, there are two new catalysts that are arguably even greater than the announcements at Nio Day.

**1) Energy**  
On Nio Day, William Li announced a second-generation Battery Swap station, where users don't even have to leave their cars. The stations are also a lot cheaper to operate, with greater capacity. They can complete about 312 battery swaps per day.

Imagine a world where Battery Stations replace Gas stations. What would that say about Nio? And what would happen to gas stations?

Well early February, William Li met with Sinopec's CEO. Sinopec is one of the largest oil and chemicals companies in the world (2nd globally according to Forbes). They have over 30,000 gas stations. Here's the kicker: There are not so subtle rumors that Sinopec gas station will incorporate Nio Battery Swap Stations. Nio plans to have 500 battery swap stations by the end 2021, some of which may be at Sinopec's stations. The growth in revenue will accelerate.

**Imagine if NIO's main source of revenue was from selling energy, rather than just cars.**

It'll send Nio's share price to the moon.

**2) Hong Kong Stock Exchange**  
Nio plans to list in the Hong Kong stock exchange around April. XPEV and LI will also be added. This is great news for Nio's stock price. An announcement about BABA listing on the HK stock exchange (around November 2019) led to its share price rising from 185 to 300 in three months.

The same will happen to Nio, and even more so, because Li and Xpev's rise will bring Nio up even more due to their coupling in various EV-related ETF's.

Watch out for an announcement in April.

**Other thoughts:** I've noticed, increasingly, that puts bought for the purpose of hedging positions are now mostly be applied to index ETF's like SPY and QQQ. Why? Because GME's short squeeze drama nearly killed several hedge funds. Sentiment Analysis has become a household name, and all the major hedge funds track WallStreetBets to avoid stocks that are too popular. Nio is one of those stocks that boomer hf's realize is one of the popular ones on ""reddit"". Google ""top reddit stocks"" and you'll see Nio routinely mentioned (this is also why I think stocks like PLTR will no longer suffer for too long).

Also Mizuho announced a Nio PT at $60, and Deutsche Bank recently released a memo stating that Nio can reach $70 in the near term. These things tell me that both retail and hedge funds are united in loving NIO stonk. We might be clear for another takeoff.

**3) What to Do**  
The dates on these catalysts are not announced like Nio Day was. All I know is that it'll happen sometime in the next few months. To play it safe, I would buy call leaps. My price target is 70-80 by EOY. Also, load up shares on dips and sell covered calls each time we reach new highs. I plan to diamond hand Nio, as I believe it'll reach higher than $300 in five years. I'll be buying/selling calls, but not sell my shares.

**4) Community Boost**  
If NIO passes $70 per share by eod, April 16, I'll donate to charity and post as an update. I don't want to virtue signal, but I hope it encourages some people on here to think about their community. I was inspired to do this by other WSBers that donated to the Food Bank with some of their GME earnings, so for that, thank you, and I hope I too can pass on the kindness.

**TLDR** \- NIO is likely to partner with the world's second largest Oil Company this year and have their newly designed battery swap stations operate in gas stations, thus Nio might actually make more money as an energy provider than a car company. Also, Nio will be listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which has helped stocks like BABA go to the moon in the past.

**TLDR** \- I'll donate to charity if NIO’s passes $70 per share by April 16."

I have a few points I want to make about theta then hopefully we can put this to rest. I'm not going to talk about Delta or IV that's a different conversation and motherfuckers need to read.

Real quick:

* Not a pro
* Not investment advice
* Advice about how you need to actually learn shit

If you're too retarded to understand basic math or you're too lazy to try to actually better yourself then click the back button now. For the retards that stick around I'll include pictures and a fun little story.

Okay about 3% of you should be left so let's dive in.

# Theta

 The term theta refers to the rate of decline in the [value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/value.asp) of an option due to the passage of time. It can also be referred to as the [time decay](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timedecay.asp) of an option. This means an option loses value as time moves closer to its [maturity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp), **as long as everything is held constant**. Theta is generally expressed as a negative number and can be thought of as the amount by which an option's value declines every day. 

Theta is an estimate of value decay. It's a rate that's continuously adjusted. Every second that passes makes your option worth less and less. The biggest misconception is the one I want to focus on the most. We talk about it it terms expressed in decay on a day I think for our simple brains but it's not that simple just like days aren't really exactly 24 hours and there's complex reasons why.

# THETA. IS. NOT. LINEAR.

You dickheads remember y=mx+b from middle school? that's linear. Here's theta on an option graphed for a 1yr contract.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.optiontradingtips.com\/greeks\/theta.html](https://preview.redd.it/k3zpzuyfzvm61.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=359ec39cb38f082a8ca2fe69f7f562cf2ec441da)

 Theta is exponential. the theta decay on your option accelerates over time. Look at that last little sliver of the chart. See how sharp it goes down? That's 'FD' range. That's when all the value of the option evaporates nearly instantly like your wife's interest in you when she met her boyfriend.

&#x200B;

# Theta will eat your lunch

Last week I had a C250 FD on GME that I had to close on a loss even though it was ITM. WHY? Because the rate of decay on the option was so fast that GME **wasn't rising fast enough to increase the value of the option and make up the difference**. Buying OTM and going ITM is good but it's important to understand that even IF you are ITM it still won't save you from theta and sometimes it's smarter to take profit rather than waiting. **You COULD even take the profit and buy the underlying**...

# Retard/Ape edition incase you're somehow still here

You live in Loserville and want to move to TendieTown. The distance is 1000 miles. You have 1 work week to get there( 5 days). So first thing you realize is that you can travel 200 miles per day and you'll get there on time. Great. Say you take Monday off. Suddenly you need to travel 250 miles per day. Not impossible but okay that's not a fun speed to move at. Take note it's a 25% increase. Let's say again on the second day there's no 'movement'. Now you need to cover the same 1000 miles in 3 days. Okay now you're looking at 333.3 miles. That's a 33.33% increase from the previous day. Holy shit now you need to fucking move and move fast. But let's say for one reason or another you, ""**G**ary **M**ichael **Edward**"" can't get out of bed on Wednesday. Still have 1000 miles to travel. Now you need to cover that distance in 2 days with an average velocity toward your goal at 500 miles per day. That's a 50% increase from the previous day. And on the last day you need to do all 1000, which is a 100% increase from the previous day.

This is a gross over simplification but it at least gets point across.

Do you guys get it now? Every day without progress makes the goal much more unlikely because the burden just shifts and grows exponentially to the remainder of time. As the likelihood of the open hitting ITM increases and time passes, theta acts as a decaying agent on the price bringing it into balance.

* Please stop reading option tutorials from plumbers / dog walkers / high school teachers
* Please read about these concepts on actual investing websites and not the worlds Instagram of trading addiction or watch video from actual professional investors
* If someone tells you they're not a pro/ are retarded think twice about letting them explain shit to you.
* Read a book motherfucker

FD's made this casino notorious because people who were here well before I was started posting crazy yolo FD's -  who knew how acidic theta was and still bought and occasionally made disgusting returns.  


Good luck everyone. I know all you are going to pump FD's with your stimmy so I guess just have fun and please try to learn how to read."

2021-03-14 04:09:14,wallstreetbets,"How the United States government could benefit from meme stocks going to the moon # DISCLAIMER: NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVISE OR 100% BASED ON FACT(S). THIS IS SIMPLY EDUCATIONAL AND THEORETICAL DISCUSSION.

# TL;DR: Capital gains tax, easing and even erasing debt, financial stimulus to peoples all over the world, a happier and more compliant population, tax dodgers and those who screwed over the world in 2008 brought to justice in the only way that matters, and a much needed stock market correction that could prevent a future disaster.

We all know that many meme stocks theoretically have the potential to explode through short and gamma squeezes, and that will make many shareholders on the long side a lot of money.

However, when looking at the bigger picture, there is a lot that the government could gain from such events that can help them and the country in a long run.

Let's take a look at the aftermath of meme stocks mooning;

# 1.) Capital Gains Tax

When people sell their meme stock shares after short squeezes occur, governments will attain taxes off these investments. Considering that millions of shares will be traded frequently for large sums of money, that will bring some much needed stimulus to the economy.

This is especially considering how 40% of America's money has been printed in the last year due to COVID-19. Instead of raising taxes on the American people and having them pay more for their own money in the long run, the capital gains taxes from these stocks can potentially make that unnecessary.

Also, with more money gained from stocks, many will likely re-invest some (or even most) of their money back into the stock market; leading to even more capital gains taxes being reaped.

# 2.) People being more willing and able to spend, further stimulating the economy and creating a happier population

It's no surprise that when times are tougher economically, people tend to spend less and save more. Yet because this leads to governments reaping less taxes and businesses not being as profitable, this makes economic times rougher, which in turn...

Leads to a potentially endless economic recession/depression.

We've seen this in Japan in the late 1990's and early 2000's, and they are currently at economic levels that are equal to their status in 1980. They've gone backwards in terms of their financial progression.

With the general population in possession of large sums of money, however, this allows the economy to be stimulated; which not only benefits many people from nearly all classes, but also creates a happier population overall.

Imagine it; after a year of prolonged quarantine, job loss, future inflation and economic instability, all while billionaires and institutions are playing the system and becoming even more rich for their own sakes...

Suddenly get served justice...

Then their money gets divided among those who took the most risks and played against them, fought the fight to the end, and helped make the world a better place.

This is practically the script to Endgame; heck, most action/heroic movies. And the American people get to be a part of it.

Speaking of ""bad guys"";

# 3.) The gains also won't be in the hands of large tax dodgers

We all know that tax dodging is practiced by many, especially those in large positions of power and wealth. 

So is it truly wrong to reasonably assume that many big Wall Street players are dodging taxes?

For the U.S. government, this means that a lot of money that should and could be going towards erasing national debt, fortifying infrastructure, improving medical and educational institutions, and many more benefits for Americans overall is instead being kept away for the sake of keeping rich individual's bank accounts filled with zero's. 

With the money in the hands of the average citizen, however, the vast majority will not be able to commit tax fraud (if at all) on a massive level. 

Of course, they won't go out quietly when the squeezes happen, yet that can still be a good thing because;

# 4.) The stock market needs a correction

Many have been speculating that the stock market is not accurately reflecting the American economy, and that a correction is inevitable.

When the squeezes happen for meme stocks, however, after the new DTCC rule comes into effect, that will force hedge funds to liquidate much of their assets to cover their positions.

They'll likely sell their other shares in massive volumes; causing huge dips to occur in many stocks across the stock market.

Yet once the dust settles, people can finally reassess the market(s) and determine where everything should be.

Stocks that deserve to be higher will be on huge discounts for many investors to get in on and allow them to go back up again, while those that deserve to be down will likely stay down.

Then, the economy can become stabilized again, and everything can continue as it should.

# Whether all of this is correct or not is beyond me, and only based on the information I currently know. 

# There's far more that could and could not happen based on if/when meme stocks skyrocket and force many shorters and market makers to buy stocks at higher prices.

# But most importantly, I wanted to start a potential discussion on the aftermath of meme stocks going to the moon, and allow others to also and and correct my statements as well as share this info with the overall community.

# So what do you think?"

2021-03-14 03:01:34,wallstreetbets,"OIL Prices to the MOON!!!! $RIG Historical:

Oil prices have rallied over 100% from last year, after the kremlin and Saudi Arabia got into a disagreement last years OPEC meeting, which resulted in a 30% decline in oil over the weekend. The major issue was over the depth and extend of the oil cuts. Russia didnt believe in cutting oil, as they kept losing market share to American Oil companies. Saudi Arabia wanted to keep the prices propped up and extend the oil production cut agreement.

&#x200B;

This resulted in oil prices dropping to negative prices with added stress of covid 19. However, the biggest challenge to high oil prices was President Donald J. Trump. Prior to Covid 19, oil prices recovered from the 2014 oil crash in which oil prices fell to $20 a barrel. Oil prices reached prices as high as $80 per barrel. However, every time oil prices passed $70 a barrel he would tweet about the high prices, or give Saudi Arabia a call. However, Donnie T is gone, and we have a President Biden running the show. It is clear, from the past month, that president Biden is not willing to interfere and calm the market.

&#x200B;

Prediction:

As a result of the economy opening back up, vaccine distribution coming along, higher airline numbers,  Donald Trump is gone, and general compliance by the  Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries I expect the oil prices to move past 80 dollars in the coming months.

&#x200B;

Play:

I will play this environment by buying oil offshore drillers. My target company is $RIG. Rig has trippled in price since the start of the pandemic. While it does have 8 billion in debt, I think it could easily refinance this. Offshore drillers get paid per day by oil exploration companies to extract oil. This is called the day rate. At the low of the oil crash offshore drillers such as RIG were getting paid 150k, but that rate has reached a high of 350k. This will continue to increase as oil increases. Exploration companies have drastically reduced their operating investments. As the economy opens up, the exploration companies are going to be caught off their foot and will not be able to keep up with the oil demand.

&#x200B;

$RIG is one of the few strong remaining offshore explorers that has survived the oil downturn. I like the stock and expect it to reach a high of $13 from its current price of $4.50. It has a market cap of 2 billion, 8 billion in debt, and around 8 billion in offshore contracts.  It has a book value of $18, while its price hovers at $4.5. A .5 or even 1 price to book value ratio indicates 100% - 400% upside.

**This one couldn’t come at a more precarious time, as good news is now bad news**.  As reopening moves full steam ahead and we get a massive injection of economic stimulus, people are beginning to stop taking JPow at his word.  He promises a steady hand, he promises no interest rate increases, he says bond yield curve control is always on the table....and yet deep pockets flee en masse from stonks and into treasuries as the good times roll. 

**You see, the problem with the FED right now is no matter what they say, investors see the inevitable trend**.  They're betting there is only so long the FED can continue to artificially support the market--and only so long there will be reason to-- as indexes roar, the actual economy improves, and vaccine distribution is, for the most part, on track to return us to a world of pseudo-normalcy by summer.  It doesn't help that the FED stays verbally doveish while quietly doing things like declining to speak on Yield Curves definitively during speaking engagements, and [quietly ended the term repo m lending program](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/fed-ending-term-repos-reflects-liquidity-feast-for-dealers). 

**My choice here is between treasury-tickers and the VXX**-- last time I was making this choice I went with VXX on the DD, and that choice didn't pan out until the second week.  I said then, reflecting on that week’s losers, that I should have chosen treasuries...**so why didn’t I this time with the opportunity right here?**  *VXX is just absurdly low right now, trading under $14*.  I'm not saying the pop will happen Tuesday or Wednesday, but it may, and dollars to donuts if you hold a VXX 14 or 14.50c 4/1 you'll make some money at some point if you don't hold too long after it makes a run.  Also, if Jerome breathes a word about Yield Control they will plummett. 

**This intro is also my way of admitting my confidence level this week is low—there is too much potential for chop**.  Sure, I could be wrong and we go to the moon once stimmies start hitting people’s accounts, and that argument is fair as I see some of the new age commodities mooning to ATH over the wekend.  But, for the most part, I'd rather put on a jimmy hat this week and hope my safe picks don't come back burning me.

But anyway, **you didn’t come here for my half-baked philosophy on impending market volatility.  YOU CAME CUZ YOU HEARD WE GOT THEM BAGGERS**.  So, let's talk whales.

***

**Shoutout to unusual whales who makes this possible through letting me share their pick info! They’re great!**

**Last week’s lovers**: **DKNG** absolutely crushed it. **Tier 2**, on a sustained measurement over the week, actually defeated Tier 1.  **OCGN SQ EBAY** all had magnificent moments in the sun aided by that crazy **4% NASDAQ Day**.

**Mid-week Pivot**: The **F** call mid-week was clutch on the 13c, and now it's sitting above that price to end the week.  Also, I know y'all were feeling the heat on that **T** mid-week pivot call, but Friday brought us the glory. I was sweating though 😅 

**Last week’s lesson**: **GE** and **DIS** were hotter than shit wrapped in tin foil coming out the gate on Monday, then they hit us with that nasty curve.  **News broke that GE was closing a huge deal on Sunday, which gave me continued optimism, and then they just demolished the call holders with that fucking reverse split**--if you say you saw that coming, you's a damn lie.  DIS got great news, but it was crossing a key 200 resistance number (is that TA?  I don't know man, I think so), and couldn't hold.  I **think the key here is it’s okay to take a pause on the pick if it’s hot fresh out the gate the week of the RAMBO.  There will be more picks.  The other lesson here is that when the event is big enough, it plays like an earnings rather than a pump**.  DKNG, for example, had pump written all over it.  It was more about future potential than earnings in the description. Conversely, the GE annual event had an ER feel, particularly in articles I read Tuesday.  **Meme stock pump event=good.  Boomer stock boring investor event=be wary.  Stock crossing a big round resistance number leading into an event=watch how it behaves, and if it dips catch it post-event.**

**”Never lost, just ran out of time”**: Someone pointed out in a comment the M 3/26 20c i went with from two DD's ago is puh-rinting.  Should've held I guess.  Womp Womp.

***

**Tier 1**: Dice I'm Rolling with this Week (intriguing whale bets, with RAMBO (non-ER pumps), sectors or tickers I like) *disclaimer: this may be choppy as week enter positions on dips, long dates*

[MA](https://i.imgur.com/ufR3TrB.jpg) ([3/23 B of A electronic payments symposium](https://investor.mastercard.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))

When I said playing it safe I guess I meant it lol.  MA is going from your grandfather's favorite holding to an interesting FinTech play that is showing malleability in a fast-paced industry.
[They're doing cool stuff like this merger with Payoneer](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/fintech-payoneer-partners-with-mastercard-ahead-of-3-billion-spac-.html) and, for better or worse, they've joined the growing list of companies linking their perceived fate to the commodity that shall not be mentioned.  

I just generally like the stock, but I think this conference presentation will be a great catalyst as they have a chance to expose some of their new school thinking and get some nice quotes for FinTwit pumps.  Getting in early in case stimulus excitement waves can give a little push in banking and financial processors, but weary of entry because of FOMC.

[NOK](https://i.imgur.com/EL3aSk8.jpg) ([Nokia Capital Markets Day 3/18](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news-and-events/events-calendar/investor-relations-events/capital-markets-day/))

**Me two paragraphs ago**: I'm playing it safe this week.  **Also me**: Let's pick a failed meme that is a favorite of foreign bots.  

Someone in the comments on my last DD was pumping this, and I kinda didn't pay it to much attention at first.  But, they had some interesting things say about NOK, and convinced me that the foreign de-listing wasn't as big a deal as people were intimating. 

Sometimes you gotta plug your nose--*hate the stonk, love the RAMBO*.  **The general consensus around this event is that this is moment NOK needs to do SOMETHING to please investors**.  NOK is also sticking to the messaging that this a strategy reset of sorts.  The key pump factor here is *whether or not they will set a definitive dividend policy*--that's what I'm watching for.  If we get the dividend announcement, the sky is the limit.  If we don't, well, bail out quickly, because this sinking ship may head for Davey Jones' Locker (I'm so corny bruh 😭 ).

[Somebody did a solid DD write-up on NOK](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m33vsq/full_diligence_post_on_nokia_nok_ahead_of_capital/) pre-event at r/investing.  I'm sure the sub will be appalled that I'm mining their shit for options speculation lol.

[VXX](https://i.imgur.com/CdGUT8U.jpg) (FOMC March 16-18th discussing potential yield curve control, etc)

The intro pretty much states where I'm at on this. **I like the 14c 4/1**--my plan is to wait for an assumed green open Monday, and see if I can pick up a nice premium price just before the classic fade.  **I’m going to hold until it pops, through the FOMC RAMBO**, and if the markets don't go red i'll probably trim some for a loss but keep holding for a level of general volatility.  If we open red Monday, I'll let action settle and push out to the 14.50c probably.  I dunno, I'm just a dog chasing cars.

**Tier 2**: Watching with great interest

[AAPL](https://i.imgur.com/C40J4QR.jpg): [Rumored product launch event on 3/23](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.indiatoday.in/amp/technology/news/story/apple-may-launch-airpods-3-ipad-pro-update-and-more-products-at-march-23-event-1777186-2021-03-09). Thanks /u/7thprincess 

[ABNB](https://i.imgur.com/XinYxt5.jpg): No rambo, but look at this crazy ass whale bet that came through with hilarious VOL/OI. People are betting on reopening, sure, but this feels welrd as hell and i love it. 

[CRSR](https://i.imgur.com/W0soBkU.jpg): No whale betting, but some other UOA and I am very intrigued by their event coming up on the 16th, **The Macquarie Consumer Bright Ideas Conference**.  Sounds pumpish, and they're trotting the CEO out.

[GPRO](https://i.imgur.com/tdX3a7c.jpg): Tons of consistent whale betting matching performance of an uptrend.  Been on a tear, so may need a little dip to get a good entry point, but I want to follow the money on this one.

[CS](https://i.imgur.com/5D7VBrd.jpg)/[DB](https://i.imgur.com/QnUyMK4.jpg): boring financials plays without UW bets, but still pumping nicely in other UOA registers.  CS has a conference presentation the morning of 3/16 and is releasing their annual report on 3/18. DB has a presentation on 3/18.

****

Remember, this week could be super flukey, so long dates, timing your entry, and the ability to HODL are key.  I'm genuinely not excited about this week, not gonna lie.

**TLDR**

This week could be choppy with FOMC, so I'm grabbing some **VXX**, playing a longer **MA** call for a spicy safe haven, and buying **NOK** leading into their capital markets day as a purely speculative play.

**AAPL** has a rumored product launch coming on the 23rd, **CRSR** has an interesting conference, and **GPRO** continues to recieve bullish whale bets.

Inbox always open.  Happy hunting everybody."
2021-03-13 23:25:56,wallstreetbets,YOLO’d my life saving into shares because I don’t know how to buy options. 
2021-03-13 23:25:30,wallstreetbets,"Hey 🌈🐻 I got a real juicy 🍌for you - SKLZ I have reason to ***believe*** this company could lose like 90% of their revenue **OVERNIGHT.**

**Don't** look at my post history unless you need proof **I'm retarded**

I've dumbed down my ***beliefs*** to **2** core reasons

**Their Monetization Model is insane, you have a better chance winning at the casino than you do betting on SKLZ games.**

* On average, players have nearly a 7% statistical edge going to the casino and playing black or red on roulette like a smooth brained dummy fuck (This is literally my favorite way to play roulette so I know what I'm talking about)
* Let me break it down further, going off of the fact that they take 14% of all bets on average(You'll have a hard time finding this on their site - [https://www.skillz.com](https://www.skillz.com/) \- but this Bloomberg article mentions the 14% fee [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/skillz-soars-in-trading-debut-as-investors-bet-on-mobile-esports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/skillz-soars-in-trading-debut-as-investors-bet-on-mobile-esports).
* So let's say you want to make 10 bets on a SKLZ game. You bet $50 on each game, and so does your opponent. The matchmaking system knows to put you with players of similar skill so unsurprisingly, the 10 game streak ends in a 5-5 draw. Both players will have lost $70 in this situation. If the streak went 6-4 in your favor, you would have earn a measly $16 dollars. SKLZ appears to only want to increase this percentage. I refuse to believe this pricing model will have an appeal to mainstream audiences when they see how hard players are getting boned.

**Where does Apple's 30% take of In-App purchases fit in?**

* Of this 14% taken from each betting transaction, what is Apple getting from the cut? I am having trouble finding any evidence that apple is making money from these bets that are taking place on their platform. I have reason to believe that SKLZ may be bypassing Apple's 30% fee, as 14% is clearly less than 30%. SKLZ apps allow you to put money into an account without going through the app store. 
* **Fortnite got banned from the app store for doing exactly this.**
* If games using the SKLZ plugin get banned from the app store, this company will lose all revenue it earns from the App Store. What would this scenario mean for the stock being that it's currently valued around $10 billion dollars as a hyper growth company that doesn't seem to have apps on any other platform?
* In the event Apple is getting a cut, how much are they getting? What kind of special treatment is SKLZ getting from Apple? We need to hear from Apple about this companies monetization model. 
* How much longer is Apple going to allow $200 Million Dollars of revenue to go through at a fraction of what they are typically owed?"
2021-03-13 23:16:46,wallstreetbets,"Hear me out guys... First off, as an individual who started trading around August 2020, I am incredibly grateful for this community and dumbfounded by the incredibly talented collective of traders active on Reddit. I only started using reddit as an equity/creeptoe resource in January. So thank you for allowing me into your world.

Having watched the deluge of brand new traders flood into Reddit this year (myself being one of them), I’m equal-parts euphoric and terrified. While there are some incredibly wise contributors to the cause of effective retail trading tirelessly pouring their efforts into moderation and quality content, there are 50x the amount of naive, greenhorn traders, many quite young.

As I begin to gain my bearings in this insanely abnormal market and test my ability to stomach volatility, I can’t help but notice a dichotomy forming. A healthy fear of bots and shills is absolutely necessary for the battle we have found ourselves in. But division amongst an army creates a very easy weakness for powerful anti-retail entities to exploit.

I believe the strength of the Reddit army is also its greatest crux: its decentralization. While there are likely hundreds of thousands of wise, experienced traders within the ranks, there are MILLIONS of brand new people here screeching at each other using autism as an excuse.

Autism is a way of life, not a tool for irrational and emotional rejection of anything that does not serve confirmation bias. Reddit has allowed retail traders a chance to not just sit at the table, but flip it over and piss on it. Which we are currently doing (love you fuckers). However, if we begin allowing emotions to take the place of spirited intellectual and informed discussion, we simply won’t amass the momentum needed to bowl these fuckers over.

I’m not saying to take it easy on dummies and dicks, getting rammed for being an idiot is insanely helpful as a young trader. But try at least a LITTLE to have some patience for the n00bs and guide them. They are our children. The most attractive aspect of Reddit imo is the inclusiveness of the community. 

Let’s not lose that spark of magic that brought all of us here to begin with, as millions of young people look to us and this beautiful place to help them take control of their own fates, as we all seek to do with our own.

Thank you for reading my rant. I’m not a shill, I’m not a bot. I’m a dumb ape that doesn’t give financial advice and likes watching banana become bananasquared."

LLY LLY is the maker of PROZAC and if you are anything like me you feel like you need some after not buying GME at $5 .. Should you buy GME after it rose 50x ? I'm kinda scared to do that even though I'm a retard. And I hope I'm wrong and GME rises another 50x for all the APES that are in YOLO positions.

AMC is only up 5x and holding $10.25 WHICH is possibly bullish. So, we can all pop a prozac and go the movies and escape our sour thoughts on missing out on the GME frenzy :) .. This will help both those stocks if you feel like they are a good alternate investment. Time to cheer up the old fashioned way :)

2021-03-13 23:01:29,wallstreetbets,"For those of you in $GME, myself included, as well for anyone else investing bear this in mind, from a new lurker who has learned the hard way. It is entirely your money on the line. Personally, I have a very specific goal in mind with $GME. I am in at 22 shares at about $222. I stand by this movement, for many reasons, and for those who bite that potential loss in the name of change I honestly salute you.

But the nature of the market is there will always be bag holders. I accepted this risk, you accepted this risk. In the coming weeks, please take DD with a grain of salt and do not let people influence your own plan of just instinct. I let myself get cooerced into buying it at around 340 a share like the degenerate I am; I lowered the average because I personally believe in the company long term, squeezes aside. But this decision cost me a lot. While I could cash out this very moment for profit, had I waited even a week, like I wanted to initially, I would have gotten in at not even half that lol. If you are in this for the squeeze, keep that goal in mind and don't let paper hand jokes and peer pressure make you commit horrible decisions with your finances. At the end of the day, a million people may cheer you into bankruptcy but I doubt a single one will stand by to lift you out of it. Regardless of $GME, $AMC, meme stock or a fucking boomer stock, you need to put yourself first above everything else. My girlfriend gave me excellent advice the other day I wanted to share with you all; treat this like an airplane crashing. Put your own mask on before you think of anyone else's. If you gotta stomp people like me down to make it out okay, do it without remorse. That's free market at work, honestly. We all take a risk for a big pay and we all can bounce back if this pays off. But please keep in mind a lot of people on here posting massive loss porn have safety nets in place;  Roth IRAs, good jobs, other plays to hedge losses, etc. Don't presume you can be a consistent retard YOLOing your life savings and walk away from it. I am turning 25 on the 23rd (Daddy Cohen is gifting me an earnings report ☺) and even just 5k is a huge play on my part. Be smarter than me; be an autist.

God speed, retards.

P.S. Mad respect to the dude who convinced his girlfriend to tattoo her ass. That was hilarious.

P.P.S. not fixing typos; I am high on Xanax.

P.P.P.S. I really don't care if people label me as a shill or some shit. This is just common sense; remember some of the 8 or 9 mil are actual children. They need a slap from reality. And yes, I am an asshole but I am at least not one with my head up my ass."
2021-03-13 22:54:22,wallstreetbets,"This won't end until Hedge Funds exit their short positions Best case scenario is we get a squeeze within the next few months. The worse case scenario is another round of paperhands (due to the attention we're getting) causing another selloff. But, here's the kicker:

It literally doesn't matter. Yes, I believe the stock will squeeze, and soonish, but let's consider a hypothetical situation in which we squeeze up a bit and these little paperhands sell off enough to cause panic (I realize this kind of sentiment is against the status quo here) -- this cycle will likely just continue. Shorts will be too proud to cover, stock will dip and then slowly rise, more will fomo in, and the cycle will repeat. This'll happen over and over again I'd imagine.

What I'm getting at is that the Hedge Funds just need to realize this will never end. We *know* they're completely underwater. We smell blood in the water. Delay it as much as you can, I guess, but we're gonna get that ass.

Regardless, hold and buy. Tendies await us.

&#x200B;

Edit: To be clear, holding *through* dips is paramount. It helps the MOASS which will bless you with infinite tendies, but also, trying to time any cycle can cause you to miss out on said unlimited tendies. I'm merely hypothetically speaking about worst case scenario which isn't all that bad, regardless.

Edit 2: Here's me predicting the situation we're currently in right after the first squeeze:

2021-03-13 22:13:11,wallstreetbets,"ASTARTES!! GET IN AND HOLD GAW.L is the ticker, games workshop is the company

Last year a 5 part mini-series was released by a fan animator called the Astarte's project, It released to massive acclaim whilst being only 15 minutes long in total, if you are aware of the 40K universe and story that is part of the main line of games workshop products you have probably seen this and its my bet that you think its the best animation that has ever come out of that IP.

On April 2nd 2020 the final part was released and at the same time the value of the stock skyrocketed doubling its value in 2 and a half months alone. going from $4000 - $8000. currently its sitting just under 10K  after peaking at 12K in November and is in position to swing either way.

Roughly 2 days ago games workshop announced that they had officially hired the guy to work on more animations along with a handful of other lesser known but still greatly skilled fan animators that are loved in the community. This recent news is in my opinion a good sign of an upswing, along with their recent and ongoing collaboration with marvel, for better or for worse, it seems quite popular.

Warhammer has been on the verge of breaking through to the mainstream for years and years, but I believe with this recent news we could expect gains real soon, particularly the Astarte's project news, back when it released it attracted a whole range of new fans to the IP, simply on the quality of the animation alone.

And to further tickle the pickle of anyone on the fence, they pay good dividends!

(I do hold a small amount of stock in GAW.L but i am not a financial analyst and what i say should not be taken as financial advice, this is simply based on public and consumer opinion alone, rather dry on mathematical analysis)

2021-03-13 22:04:54,wallstreetbets,"Slide into these $DM's Listen up retards, Desktop Metal is about to announce their first earnings on Monday, and they are looking juicy.

First, Institutional Transactions last Quarter were up 314.23%. Someone wants this company to succeed, and if their Desktop Metal 3D Printer does what they say, then this company absolutely will. Insider ownership is almost 40%, and that doesn’t hurt either.

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DM&ty=c&p=d&b=1](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DM&ty=c&p=d&b=1)

The price rocketed to $34.94 in February, but has since fallen with a lot of other tech stocks. This is the time to buy.

They offer their printers as a Hardware as a Service model, which I may personally dislike, but the lower up front cost is a benefit to consumers when printers can cost anywhere from $15,000 to $120,000. And if the desktop metal printer can make end use metal parts IN AN OFFICE, then manufacturing firms are going to want one. I know I do. HAAS also means monthly recurring revenue for assets that the company still technically owns.

And this company isn’t only hiring, they are hiring a MERGERS & ACQUISITION CORPORATE COUNSEL!

So they are either looking to buy out some competition (maybe Markforged?) or get bought (3D Systems? They were the OG's, fell of the face of the earth, but are rebounding). Either way, I like the odds.

But then again, I’m a fucking retard that just loves 3D Printers. I flipped a coin to see if this is good news or bad, so take from it what you will. I'll be buying in pre-market on Monday."
2021-03-13 21:49:17,wallstreetbets,"GME Technicals, DD, short interest This will be long apes so please bull with me. This is going to be a breakdown of GME's chart from a technical perspective as well as my thoughts on the short interest and where this is all going. I would just like to apologize in advance for all of the lines on my charts. I am fucking retarded and my smooth brain needs lots of lines, but I'll try to make it easy to understand.

**Technical breakdown:**

On the 20 day chart, we can see that GME is going up in a stair-step pattern, which is obviously extremely bullish. A stair-step pattern is where it rises up, consolidates lightly, then uses the previous resistance as support for the next stair-step. We are currently in a consolidation phase of that stair-step. As you can see, the red lines that I circled were previously resisstance but are now support. This is bullish.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sacw2jztcum61.png?width=2218&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ee1373bb21434559cf835cd9cc96e27d3151c9b

Next, and probably one of my favorite things, is the fact that on the day we went from 348 all the way down to 180, we had STRONG support at the 180 level, which, as I said above, was the resistance from the first step, which is now our support. Even better is the fact that our current consolidation is forming a pennant pattern from that support. A pennant pattern usually indicates that a stock will continue its trend (in this case up). This is extremely bullish, dare I say... apeish. The orange lines show the pennant pattern that I'm talking about and the two circles show the high and low of that pattern (lmao also kinda looks like a torpedo cock and balls). It's important to note that although the chart makes it appear that it will be breaking that pattern soon, the pennant could just extend, so do not think that it's going to break the pattern on Monday because though it very well could, it could also just continue consolidating:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5q6m693wcum61.png?width=2222&format=png&auto=webp&s=f323375e4cbe77a09f904504c074dadee2823c5a

When it finally stops consolidating and breaks this pattern to continue rising, the green line above should act as support for our next stair step, which would put us at 350ish for support, which is huge.

For the 90 day chart, you can see that a few weeks ago we broke the giant triangle pattern, which is how we got into the current bullish movement. Those lines are yellow:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7gwk7ocxcum61.png?width=1586&format=png&auto=webp&s=1955427bbbc72fb02af1766c5a04ec80403e2960

Finally, in the chart above, I have marked the areas of CRUCIAL resistance. These are the fat green, yellow, and red lines. I made them those colors because each one that we break is more crucial than the previous one because of the last squeeze.

**What to take away from the chart action:** we are currently in a consolidation period of a stair-step pattern that has happened because we broke the triangle pattern that we started after the price went down from the last squeeze. This is very ~~bullish~~ apeish. Again, I apologize for all the lines, I'm a technical trader and I make a shit ton of support and resistance lines for my smooth brain.

**Volume**: everyone is talking about the squeeze, shorts, and price action, and blah blah but the thing that everyone needs to be talking about is volume. VOLUME VOLUME VOLUME. The ONLY WAY that any type of squeeze can happen is volume. I know that people don't like the VW comparison (and I'm not comparing them here, just using this as an example), but the squeeze was only able to happen because of tremendous volume

&#x200B;

As far as GME's current volume, we are not there (but don't get down on it becuase WE WILL BE). The only way for shorts to be squeezed is for a major influx of volume to drive the price up significantly, forcing them to cover. In the previous squeeze, volume spiked tremendously and would have continued to increase if brokerages wouldn't have cut off buying. The CEO of Interactive Brokers even said that the price would reach over 1k if they didn't shut of buying, why? Volume. So, for GME's volume, it's plain and simple, it needs to increase (but I will not that the fact that the price is increasing so much without massive volume is even more ~~bullish~~ apeish).

**But Hank, how does volume increase?** Excellent question, tard brain. For GME, and most stocks but especially GME, catalysts are what drives volume up. Below is a picture of GME's volume since the January action:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rcu25cl0dum61.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d90f2c7ba53929f73b6dfbc02d2b9f23f84c7a2

The first spike in volume was in late November when Ryan Cohen announced his stake (but the jump wasn't super significant). The first big spike that you can see is on January 11-13ish when they announced that Ryan Cohen was being added to the board. In the next few days we see volume decline but still elevate compared to previous levels because of increased media attention. The next jump in volume (lots of red) is when Andrew Left of shitron had his week-long down-syndrome tantrum about GME and get his cheeks clapped by WSB. This giant volume orgy is continued for the next few days when Elon tweets ""Gamestonk,"" Chamath buys a bunch of calls, and other celebrities like Mark Cuban voice their support. We then see volume teeter off because of the brokerage cucks ass ramming us. The next spike in volume corresponds to when GME ousted their CFO (many thought that Ryan Cohen led this). We then see volume decrease a little. Volume the picks back up when GME announces that it has appointed Cohen as the head of their committee on changing GME to a digital company. Volume has since gone down a little, but the price has gone up (erection!).

**What to take from this**: Plain and simple, volume is king. Volume is your wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's boss's wife's boyfriend. We cannot have another squeeze without volume, BUT volume, especially in GME's case is greatly correlated with catalysts.

**Volume Catalysts**: Here are some potential volume catalysts that could lead to the massive spike that we need: GME appointing a new CFO, GME appointing Ryan Cohen as CEO, better than expected earnings, an acquisition, support/investment from big names (i.e. Cuban, Elon, Burry, etc), new committees/initiatives/anything relating to their digital transformation, quadruple witching day March 19th (still not sure how I feel about this and definitely don't think it's the be all end all that many others do but it could certainly help). Overall, it appears that the best catalysts are ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and digital transformation. Personally, I think that if during their earnings call Cohen announces he's gonna be CEO or announces some big digital move, that will give us the volume we need. It's important to note that it appears that Ryan Cohen wants this to happen (and why wouldn't he, his net worth is tied to it) as evident by the tweets that he's put out that, though cryptic, seem to be implying support of WSB and hatred of shorts. Roaring Kitty has also been very cryptic lately and it appears that he thinks something big is coming too (this is just speculation tho, I'm tard).

**TTM Squeeze and MACD**: Two of my favorite indicators are MACD and TTM squeeze. I don't wanna explain them here because I only have so many chromosomes available to me each day, but they essentially indicate momentum. On my charts, I combine the MACD lines with the TTM squeeze because they move similarly and I think that TTM is superior to MACD's histogram. As you can see, on the 1-year chart, the MACD is in a VERY bullish pattern right now. What I'm more excited about is the TTM squeeze (the colorful bars). In a TTM squeeze indicator, the light blue lines indicate that the price has extremely bullish momentum (it's in relation to Bollinger bands and keltner channels). When the bars turn dark blue, there is still bullish momentum, but it's fading. The red bars indicate bearish momentum and the yellow bars indicate fading bearish momentum. As you can see, are currently in some VERY Strong light blue bars. For a TTM Squeeze, there are usually 7-10 light blue bars in an extremely bullish pattern. From the last squeeze, you can see that there are like 5 really tiny light blue bars and then like 3 bigger ones. This indicates that we are currently in the middle of/approaching giant price action, but also that the current price action is better than last time and is forming a more stable, high arching uptrend. If you're thinking, ""oh man Unlce Hank, we've already had 5 light blue bars, the squeeze is almost over"" - not so fast tard. Though I said that there's usually 7-10 of these bars in an uptrend, that's not always the case, and going to dark blue bars simply may mean that we are consolidating and will go back to light blue bars. Overall, all this should show you is that yes, we are in a bullish trend and things are looking perfect. This is one of my favorite indicators and I believe that it's giving us INSANELY good signs.

**A note about squeezes:** Let me be clear, if the brokerages wouldn't have cut off buying, this would have gone up past $1000 (IB CEO said this and he's a boomer-cuck). Because of this, last time was not a short squeeze, it was a gamma squeeze (or a series of them). A short squeeze would have resulted in a parabolic move to the upside accompanied by a parabolic jump in volume. Both the price and volume would look like very tall and skinny triangles (see the Volkswagen pattern for this). A short squeeze does not happen over time, it happens suddenly and very violently to the upside. Gamma squeezes, on the other hand, can happen over a period of time and can happen in small or big chunks. It's important to note that gamma squeezes can cause short squeezes and short squeezes can exacerbate game squeezes (it's a feedback loop, which is why it's so dangerous). So, currently I think that we are in the middle of a series of gamma squeezes that could lead to a short squeeze if there is a catalyst that creates volume.

**Shorts:** A lot of numbers have been floating around about short interest. Some say it's 13%, 27%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 120%, and well above 200% (I've even seen 900%). IMO, it's impossible to know right now. FINRA's release said it was about 50% and that's the one that I believe to be the most likely (definitely don't believe FINRA's 27% assplay). HOWEVER, it's important to note that those 100%+ numbers very well could be correct. The reason for this is because they can't take into consideration naked shorts (if you don't know about this there are 100s of DDs about it). So, IMO there are 2 scenarios here: 1. It's literally just 50%ish short interest on GME. Let me be clear, THIS IS STILL HUGE. Anything above 30% is huge, so 50% is still amazing and has massive short squeeze potential for GME. 2. It's actually above 200%. If the latter is true then the squeeze WILL 100% happen and will also probably crash the financial system because, as we know from 2008, when institutions get into these shady, unregulated derivative bets on volatile things, it usually creates a collateral effect. Personally, I have no clue which one is correct. The latter obviously sounds like a conspiracy but could very well be true because we all know how shady these funds are. However, it begs the question, ""why are they still doing this?"" The answer to this is they are either retarded (and not in a good way), doing it out of anger and spite (and we all know how well emotional trading goes), or they are in a bind and can't get out of it. Personally, I think that the conspiracy about naked shorts and everything is either extremely false or extremely true. If it's extremely true, then HFs are just kicking the can down the road hoping that we lose interest and the price decreases. If it's false, then we still have 50% short interest, apes, and Daddy Cohen. **TL:DR on this paragraph:** short numbers are conflicting and it's impossible to know which is correct or if the naked short theory is true. Either way, I like the stock.

**Closing thots:** The most important thing, as I said, is fucking volume. This is not just gonna magically happen. Sure, the price could very well keep increasing over the coming days/weeks on low volume and small gamma squeezes could happen, but until we get a surge in volume through a catalyst, we are not going to see the short squeeze. REMEMBER, the squeeze has not squoze until there is a parabolic move in price and volume over a very short period of time. I'm talking trading getting halted 5+ times in a single day on the upside. Do I think that these next few weeks are going to be very important, yes, especially next week and earnings week, but do I think it's over if not, fuck no! So with that being said, please try to avoid talking about dates as a certainty because it could lead to some of the younger tards selling because they're disappointed. Make sure to do what Rensole does and say that it COULD happen, that it's a possibility, not that it's the endgame or a certainty. Finally, continued talk about GME, continued buying and holding, and continued retardation are key. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, I SIMPLY HAVE A SMALL PENIS AND AN ADDICTION TO CUCK PORN.

**TL;DR**: I Like the stock.

EDIT: I also wanted to add that though GME's rising price action could be considered ""crazy,"" it's market cap is honestly not crazy. People usually get caught up in the price but don't look at the actual market cap. GME's current marketcap is only about 18B. Is that overvalued for where the company sits at this current moment? YES. But, if GME makes a shift to the digital space and becomes the go-to for literally everything relating to gaming (and possibly gambling), then a 100 billion dollar market cap is very reasonable. This is why DFV likes the stock. I think that he was originally in it for the short squeeze, but now I think that he is truly in this company for the long run because of its potential, and I couldn't agree more! "

This is my first ever DD, with that being said please be nice, and let me know if anything is wrong and or if I didn't include anything important. Would love some **constructive** criticism, thanks. Also with that being said I don’t know anything about anything. I'm just some guy who read some stuff and compiled it all here. I can’t tell the future. I am NOT a financial advisor. I’m just an ape like all of you. PLEASE do your own research. Humans are known for being wrong and I’m no expectation. I’m bullish on this stock but it did JUST go public therefore there isn’t a ton of history for how the stock performs. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.

With that said. I hope you enjoy and learn something from this.

**Coupang Inc DD**

**Ticker - CPNG**

**Initial bullish info (for the apes who can't stand to read more than 100 words)**

* Talked about and known as the “Amazon of South Korea”
* Coupang has been the second largest e-commerce IPO since Alibaba
* Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018
* IPO jumped more than 70%
* Company was valued at $9B back in June 2020 and now is valued at around $90B with a market cap of 86B (at the time of writing)
* CEO’s a Harvard grad of the dropout (just like Zuckerberg)
* Coupang has the highest market share of Korea's E-commerce business
* Improved cash flow by almost a billion dollars in a year
* Similar to Amazon in early years with no GAAP profitability but massive cash flow
* Coupangs the most used online shopping platform in south Korea
* Coupang has continuingly growing branches in Food delivery and grocery services
* Coupang has same day and dawn delivery (place an order by midnight and get it by 7am)
* Eco friendly packaging
* Customer Base has grew by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)

Now for people who want wrinkles in their brain please continue on reading

**Quantitative:**

* Net Revenue for 2020: $12B up more than 90% from 2019
* Customer base Grew approximately 14.8 Million from 2019 to 2020
* Total net Revenues per active custom increased to approximately $256 in 2020 from $161 in 2019
* Gross profit for 2020: $2B also up more than 90% from 2019
* Operating loss for 2020: $500M down from $600M in 2019

Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018

2018: -1.5B

2019: -698M

2020: -474M

In November 2018 Softbank's Vision Fund invested over $2B with a $9B valuation which has since been increased to $86B

**Use of Proceeds:**

* Net IPO of Class A common stock was $35.00 and jumped to $69.00 (nice) once it was available to trade. However the company has stated they will not be taking proceeds from the sale of shares and rather wants to increase their capitalization, financial flexibility, and create a public market for their stock.
* Net Proceeds received from the offering are planned to be used for general corporate purposes including: working capital, operating expenses, and capital expenditures.
* Coupang is currently not planning to pay dividends and rather invest in themselves.

I really like this because they know exactly what and where their assets are and implies they will be heavily re-investing into those assets in attempts to grow them. Amazon has and is using the same formula by not paying dividends, not focusing on revenue, but focusing on growing their brand recognition and customer base (their largest asset). Amazon's TTM use of cash graph below which I predict will mirror Coupangs in the future. Again though, I don’t know anything.

📷

* **Profitability** (on a GAAP basis) was not positive. However from a cash flow basis they generated over 300M from operations and continue to generate cash flow in order to boost their operations and re-invest in themselves and grow their customer base, which continues to be their strongest asset.

**Opportunity:**

Korea's GDP “gross domestic product” (overall economic performance of a country, usually over a year) is over 1.6 Trillion and a GDP per capita (per person) of $31,847. This number continues to grow year after year as well as is evented form Korea's 2010 GDP of 1.1 Trillion.

The total spent in retail, grocery, consumer foodservice and travel in Korea was $470B in 2019 and is expected to increase to $534B by 2024. (Coupang is in 3 of 4 of those sectors)

Total spent in E-commerce was $128B and is expected to grow to $206B by 2024. On a per buyer basis, e-commerce spending is expected to grow from 2,600 in 2019 to 4,300 in 2024.

**Management:**

Range of age for management team is 36-61 with an average of age of 46

* **Bom Suk Kim -** Founder, current CEO and Chairman of the board of Coupang. Kim has a Harvard A.B degree in Government and is currently 42 making him the second youngest billionaire in South Korea. Kim founded Vintage Media Company (food industry exhibition and event planner) which he sold in 2009 before starting Coupang the following year.
* **Gaurav Anand -** Current CFO since Dec, 2020 and previously served as COO (Chief Operating Officer) from Jan, 2019 to Dec 2020. Anand has been with Coupang since 2017 and previously served as Vice President of Finance at Myntra (A fashion subsidiary of Flipkart (an online retailer which Softbank Vision Fund also invested into) and held various finance positions at Amazon from 2007 to 2014. Yeah. I know. Exciting right?
* \*\*Thuan Pham - (\*\*awesome name btw) has been Chief Technology Officer since September 2020 and served the same position at UBER from April 2013 to May 2020. From 2004 to 2013 he also served as Vice President at VMWare Inc which is a software and technology company. Pham also has both bachelors and a masters degree in computer Science and electrical Engineering From Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (this guy basically is a computer)

Other members of management have some pretty impressive credentials as well. A number of them have worked in high level management positions with Amazon like Minette Bellinagan who served as Director or Global sourcing and private Brands for Amazon. Many of them also have history in the technology and e-commerce sector with a good deal of them having experience founding their own startups such as Kiro Kyung who is a highly skilled software engineer who started two tech startups before joining Coupang.

**Qualitative:**

Company Mission: To create a world where customers wonder: “How did I ever live without Coupang?”

* **Same day and Dawn delivery** reducing delivery times to a matter of hours. (Like if amazon had the same promise of pizza companies with 30min or less delivery) People can place orders by 12pm and receive them by 7am the next morning with their Rocket WOW and Rocket Delivery program (similar to amazon prime and also includes groceries). Customers go to sleep and wake up like it's Christmas morning with their order right at their door. Same day delivery is offered for FREE, 365 days a year even the night before Christmas if needed. Customers can order anything from tomatoes to TVs for free next day delivery (better than any other delivery e-commerce players in Korea). 70% of the population (mostly in Seoul) lives within 7 miles of a Coupang distribution center. Operations span over 25 million sq ft across 30 cities.
* **Effortless returns** by tapping a few buttons on the app or website and leaving the item outside for pickup. No repackaging, no labels, no post office trips. Just leave it outside and any delivery truck nearby will come pick it up within hours. (much easier than amazon, eBay, UPS, FedEx, etc.)
* **Eco-friendly Packaging** cuts down the use of cardboard boxes by more than 75%. Items are delivered in a simple sleeve and sorted into protective bins. Eco-friendly bags that are completely reusable and replace almost all disposable packaging. The reusable bags are picked up by the delivery network for further use. Trucks leave full of products and rather than coming back empty, they arrive with returned packages, and the packaging of other orders which are then immediately used once again for another delivery.
* **Employees** work 5 day work weeks instead of the industry standard 6. Employees are provided with paid time off and full benefits. (amazon employees don't even get Amazon Prime. Amazon employees also have not reported the best working conditions. “People aren't the friendliest” “you're expected to work like a machine” “Work life balance can be hard” “needs more benefits'' etc.) Coupang Inc will also be granting their frontline workers more than $90M worth of stock and will be the first company in Korea to make their employees shareholders. 70% of suppliers for Coupang are also small merchant and business owners with under $3M in revenue per year. In the pandemic, small businesses on Coupang saw their sales increase by over 50%. Coupang now sits as one of the largest employers in Korea with 50,000+ employees and plans to invest over $870M into building seven new regional fulfillment centers, creating a projected 50,000 additional jobs by 2025.
* **Dynamic Orchestration** meaning their technology predicts and assigns the fastest and most efficient path for delivery drivers out of hundreds of millions of combinations of inventory, processing, trucks and route options within seconds. Packages are sorted at warehouses into protected, truck ready bins making the loading process much easier and faster for drivers. (can get more orders out faster.)

**Services:**

* **Rocket WOW Membership** is a flat monthly fee membership program which offers unlimited free shipping within hours of a placed order, dawn delivery, free unlimited returns for 30 days and **Rocket Fresh** groceries which has become the nation wide leading online grocer. The subscription based delivery was launched in October of 2018 and only costs $2.60! Within the first week of launch the service had over 150,000 users sign up and now has more than 1.2M users.
* **Rocket Delivery** is Coupangs FREE next day delivery service and the company has said to be delivering close to 2 million products per day which is the highest figure seen since the service was launched in March of 2014. Rocket Delivery continues to be the driving force for Coupang with people constantly wanting things faster, rocket delivery is a promise to customers that they will get their products on time, and when they need them.
* **Coupang Play** is a streaming platform branch of Coupang that is offered to their WOW members at no additional cost. Coupang Play is currently available for android users and is expected to be supported by IOS systems sometime this year as well as expanding into smart TVs and PCs. Coupang play has everything from Hollywood movies like the Spider-Man series and “Bombshell'' to popular Korean movies and TV shows. (I’d name them but I don’t think any of us know what they are). Coupang play also has documentaries, educational videos, kids shows, and animations with features like kids mode and parental locks. Coupang play is in the market for exclusivity as well with being the ONLY streaming service in Korea where users are able to watch things like Bryan Cranston's show “Your Honor” and CNN 10. Stephen Kim, the head of Coupang Play is also on record for saying *“We are eager to bring content such as Coupang Play Originals to expand our offerings and make this new service even more enjoyable and convenient for our customers.”*
* **Coupang Eats** has also been launched which is now the largest online food delivery service in Korea, which delivers food to customers using only delivery partners directly contracted by Coupang. Coupang Eats also incorporates the tech and infrastructure used for Rocket Delivery and Rocket Fresh making delivery as fast, and efficient as possible.
* **Coupangs customer centricity** continues to be their most important asset as 70% of the population is 7 miles from a distribution center. The company has vocally admitted this and consistently and continues to *“pursue operational excellence and innovation”* in order to grow this asset and keep the customers they have. Customer Base has also grown by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)

Part of Coupangs business model states all of this and I would have re-worded it but it truly is perfect and I don’t think I could have done a better job. When I first read this part of their business model it only furthered my confidence in this company. Not to mention again that this is VERY similar to how Amazon approached their business in the early years. The statement is as follows: *“We believe the true measure of our success will be shareholder value created over the long term. Our long-term investments in building a differentiated technology-orchestrated network and customer-facing functionality have helped build a business that we expect will deliver significant growth and cash flows at scale. We have in turn reinvested to expand into new offerings successfully, such as with our owned-inventory selection, Rocket WOW membership, Rocket Fresh, and Coupang Eats, among others. We will continue to reinvest cash flows generated by our established offerings into new initiatives and innovations for our customers. We will choose to invest and maximize value for customers and shareholders in the long term over optimizing our short-term results.”*

**Top Risks:**

* Coupang is rapidly evolving which could lead to the inability to manage the growth
* Coupang plans to forgo short term financial performance for long term growth (Same strategy as Amazon so in my eyes not a downside)
* **Dilution:** The company has stated that there will be (was) immediate stock dilution to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price. Though dilution is sometimes seen as a bad thing, out of all the evidence from Coupang and the business model we know they are going to follow, I believe that this dilution is simply to raise money for further expansion. I believe this dilution is why Coupang had a red day on Friday and may continue to be red for the next few weeks or so as it levels out. This does not change my stance on the stock at all just thought it was an interesting point to mention since dilution can be seen as a bad thing as companies sometimes do this in desperation when they may simply need more money to cover expenses. However I think it would be stupid to assume this is the case with Coupang as it is consistently growing its assets and shows no sign of bleeding, as well as just going public. Still though, it lessens shareholders position and lowers P/E which is a measure of profitability, but again, we know Coupang is not focusing on this at the moment. All this changes in my eyes is that I’m going to watch the stock closely over the next few weeks and months to see where it starts to even out and show signs of uptrends and or downtrends.

I have tried looking around for other reasons why Coupang could fail or simply why it could truly not be the next amazon of south Korea but I have yet to find any info. If anyone does, a link would be greatly appreciated and I will edit with new info.

**TDLR:**

In my OPINION, based on everything I’ve read and compiled here, I truly think Coupang has Unlimited potential. The company has continued to show strong growth and belief in itself. It's constantly expanding into new territories as is evident with Coupang Play and Rocket Fresh as well as consistently growing their main assets. Their management team looks very Promising with backgrounds in Amazon, Uber, and A fuck load of computer engineering. Year after year revenue has been up, customer base has been up, and operating loss and net loss have been down. This company looks very promising in my eyes and I definitely will be investing in Coupang in years to come.

Thanks to everyone who stuck through all this. Again it's my first ever DD so hopefully it's not too shit. I put a lot of effort and research into this and I hope y'all gain some insight to this awesome company. PLEASE let me know if there's anything I should’ve included in this, I am hoping to get a lot better at this whole “stonks” thing. As you may have noticed I haven’t given any info on my position with the stock and that is honestly, simply because I’m waiting for my next paycheck so I can afford to buy some. I currently don’t own shares in Coupang but you can bet your ass I’m buying as much as I can the next time I have money to throw at the market. Wouldn’t you want to get into Amazon in 2005?

Thanks again, Onions. THIS IS NOT FINACIAL ADVISE

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'm sorry I cant reply to any comments, not enough Karma.

But I defiantly agree with the statement that Korea is small compared to the US and they will have to compete with Amazon if they expand to other Countries. Still don't think this means they can't be HUGLY successful in Korea.

Also I'm not sure when they can be profitable. 2024 maybe?

**His SI%$ range: 690.8% - 1038.8%**

**Daily Notes:** Oddly Slow day as fat call options expire as they were being boughten by the thousands minutes before market closed.  Extremely low Long volume, retail just holding. Off Market trades, bull instituations still carried us possible. Sizeable Shorts were place today.

**New notes for data:** It's getting to the point where Short Sellers would litterally need to be 80% of all off-market and long volume trades to be under 100%.

I changed the formula for the cost of OM volume to match the lowest price of the days as the off market is mainly Darkpool trades.

**New Conclusions** We can conclude that the % of volume used for covering is far less than their average of 30.75% since the 15th of january as a result of a big ol' FOMO rally from retail and a bull effort from institutions hogging up that volume  Therefore, it is not crazy to derive that ***SI% IS OVER 700%***, with a cost well over 5 billion $ to do so.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:** What I found was a tendency for these Short Sellers to get cocky and not cover on weeks when you would have expected them to. This means some weaks with low SV% had HUGE net gains in shorts. This never worked in reverse in the data.

**PROOF THAT FINRA DATA IS IMPOSSIBLE**  If you were to take the FINRA DATA from the 15th of january to the 24th of February, you would find that they would've needed to Cover using 30-32% of all transfers for the entire month and a half.

*Proof 1: It would have been impossible for them to comprise that portion of the covering with the FOMO wave and GAMMA squeeze that was hogging the data at the time.*  This 30-32% is notable. There was a considerable boost in daily volume in that period. So, you are talking about a MINIMAL COST OF **34.46 BILLION DOLLARS** using my formulas from my previous data. That being the bare minimum amount... just to lower it to the SI% they said it was at....

*Proof 2: We have not witnessed a loss of* ***22.65 Billion USD or more*** *from institutions in that time. That would have been a net loss btw, no bankruptcies were seen either*  I said above that I noticed that Short Sellers did not cover when the data suggested they had the opportunity. That this trend never reversed, a High weekly SV% yielded a net gain in short positions.

*Proof 3: SV% has remained over 50% throughout the 15th to 24th period, which provides evidence of a net gain in shorts... not a complete dip of the SI.*  Lastly, if all this was the way they say it did, then...

*Proof 4: The stock price would not have dropped during the period if they had covered. The data* ***HEAVILY*** *implies that shorts are used and held to stop upwards momentum*

**His Reposnse to feedback:**

&#x200B;

>Short volume % of total volume can't reliably tell you how many new shorts have entered or covered that day because below:A market maker selling you a share that they haven't yet matched up with an actual seller but do a few seconds later will get counted as a short position momentarily. This apparently can and does happen and gets counted in the short volume. Meaning exactly no new short positions were taken but the short volume went up anyway. (I believe this is actually explained on FINRA's website -[https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019))  On the flip side, it does tell you the absolute highest number of short positions that could have been taken that day so new short positions could be anywhere between 0 and the high short volume amount, but due to the above as well as shorts entering and the covering in the same day means you can't really gleam anything from it reliably. Sorry

1: What you are describing would create a net neutral movement on the share price, which was not seen.

More importantly, the data I aquired clearly shows that there was a net gain of shorts when compared to the long volume (which is where they could have covered) day after day after day. It is possible, but the data says that they have been creating more shares than they can possibly cover even if they were 100% of the long volume everyday (which, as we know, is 90% algos and day traders)

I look at things from a scientific lens. All I aimed to do was to show that it is financially and numerically ***IMPOSSIBLE FOR SI% TO HAVE LOWERED SINCE THE 15TH OF JANUARY***.  It was the running assumption that everyone who believed in this had, and I provided damning evidence for it being the case.

&#x200B;

>This is not how it works Not saying that GME short interest is X or Y. But literally this is not how it works you really can’t use short volume to determine short interest.  INTERPRETING DAILY FINRA SHORT SALE REPORTS  Mods please don’t delete 📷 I’ve seen a lot of posts about FINRA daily short sale reports and what it means. Importantly it doesn’t mean what you think. This isn’t FUD it’s just how market making works.  TL;DR a lot of the short volume is market makers shorting to facilitate buy orders and they immediately cover with the next trade.  -High short volume in the FINRA report actually often reflects net BUYING. This is why trying to interpret these reports is pretty much useless.  -That sounds crazy but that’s how market making works. -FINRA report is only for off exchange trades (dark pools). It’s a myth that dark pools are all institutional, your retail broker is sending trades to dark pools like Citadel, Virtu, etc.***\[14:02\]***\-A MM makes money on the spread between buying and selling (obviously). What happens is - your order to buy 100 shares of GME at market gets sent to a dark pool. The MM (a computer) SHORTS you those shares at $108.793 and then BUYS those shares back at $108.791. A short of 100 shares is recorded. This also explains how you see ridiculous volumes and ridiculous # of shorts every day for a stock that has a 50M float. The MM isn’t “going short” GME. They short it for a millisecond then buy a fraction of a penny lower a millisecond later.  -So high short volume in the FINRA report (which is ONLY reflecting off exchange trades (dark pools) does NOT necessarily reflect high levels of actual shorting. It often reflects high levels of buying! Um. Like we just saw this week. Repeat that It does also does NOT reflect exchange trades.  You don’t have to believe me you can read this super interesting piece here. Generally speaking, the idea that large short volume in the report is good news for holders seems true! It’s just not for the reasons you think.

&#x200B;

I didnt assume you were FUD, but it's a little sus when you open like that hahahahh  same as my answer for the last one, my data clearly shows that financially and data wise, there are more shorts being taken on most days, where the only way for them to even be below what they were on the 15th would be for them to litterally bankrupt themselves in the process.  What you describe there would have a net neutral effect on the share price. Share price plummetted as Short Volume exceeded long volume. That is the fact. The data disagrees with your rebuttal.

&#x200B;

>No, this post is misinformation. You cannot gauge short interest from short volume. Because a majority of short volume is closed in seconds. I keep telling people this. You should really make a wiki or sidebar notice about short volume. So much misinformation and misplaced hype because of short volume. High short volume does NOT mean high short interest.  To be clear, i believe short interest is super high for GME, but not due to short volume. There has been lots of legit DD done on this. But focusing on short volume is straight misinformation propagated by people who don't know what they're talking about.

&#x200B;

3. Same as the top two. Maybe try and actually take the time to read my the data I took hours transcribing and making palletable before waving it off and calling me ""Fake News"" K?   In conclusion: the data proves that SI% has gone up. The only argument Ive heard is the ""they cover instantly"" one which isnt whats shown in the data at all (its litterally the entire point of me showing Short Volume Overflow, to show how many more shorts there are compared to longs daily). If it were true, we'd have risen consistently as this theory would have 0 effect on the share price. What actually happened is they shorted it to 40$.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

Personally, as in u/moonski 's opinion,  the feedback from you all is excellent and whilst I am still sceptical of the high %s, and the *total accuracy* of the derived info, I still think it is very valuable in at least showing that reported SI is esesntially, total horseshit.

All we really have is S3 & FINRA delayed self reported data telling us SI is constantly dropping yet price action does not suppport such a low liquidity stock being covered from over 200% SI in January...

Also very weirdly the data goblin himself Ihor of S3 aka the iHorse (hes @ ihors3 on twitter ffs) tweeted yesterday that GME is a 10/10 on his new squeeze score aka the ""squeezeometer."" How this is derived  is ""a secret.""  So it's 10/10 squeeze potential yet SI is plumetting, at a mere 15% according to himself... mhm

Thus I am still totally convinced that SI is >100%, and this data shows that there is no way it is what is being report by the likes of S3 or FINRA is accurate. What we are doing here, if not proving to you what the magical SI number definitely is, is showing that SI is *substantially* higher than what reports are claiming.

I am also certain GME has a significant issue with synthetic shares due to the volume of trading being a significant % of the total free float size of 50m (more like 24m in reality). AMC, a popular meme stock trades at 30% float, and most non meme popular stocks trade far, far, far lower than this in terms of volume / float.

Interestingly I did come across this - SI was at **132% on Feb 8th**, according to S&Pglobal (you know, the guys whos name is in the S&P500) in an article posted on Feb 18 - [https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/short-interest-in-us-stocks-declines-in-aftermath-of-gamestop-saga-data-shows-62699063](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/short-interest-in-us-stocks-declines-in-aftermath-of-gamestop-saga-data-shows-62699063). They later claimed on March 2nd that SI had dropped to 24% ""in mid february"" which makes absolutely no sense given price action - 132% to 24% as the stock hoves around $40. Ok then.

So yeah, enjoy your saturday evening assigned reading even though you can't fucking read."

On March 10th at approximately 12:10 PM EST GME shares hit a recent-high of $340.20.

Moments later volume SPIKED to 1M at 12:15, 1.5M at 12:20, 3.10M at 12:25

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pbv9jg2dztm61.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=a84781c16f675309307ed66b3d778e8fab5d90cc

&#x200B;

In literally 10 minutes millions of shares became available for sale and hit every single bid-ask on the buy side. Sellers OVERWHELMED buyers and the price tanked $140.

Ask yourself for a moment why a holder of stock would ever want to get the least amount of money for it? If you wanted to sell stock you would sell it gradually so as to not 'spook' the market. You would want the price to remain strong while you un-wind your position.

There is only one explanation for what happened: a massively co-ordinated short interest attack to inspire fear and simulate a Bank Run (when the average investor loses confidence in the Church of GME and fears the price is in free fall).

They're trying to create a positive feed-back loop of fear where eventually YOU sell your shares.

This strategy of 'dumping' massive amounts of shares is, as everyone knows, VERY COMMON. It's why you see the after-market tank. It's why you see the pre-market tank. It's why you see an EARNINGS BEAT and then the shares DIVE OFF A CLIFF. It's shorts trying to inspire a panic.

What's very interesting about this short attack was that it was obviously massively coordinated. There are MANY shorts in GME and they are all acting, to some degree, independent based on their cost-basis and level of exposure. Some shorts may actually be switching their positions to go long.

[In my post here I explain why GME could be legitimately valued at $500 a share.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m35u61/memeageddon_judgement_day_witching_day_march_19th/)

This attack on March 10th reveals that there is a MASSIVE WHALE that is cornered and willing to dump billions to get out. It's absolute confirmation that someone does not want to have to buy-back shares at these prices.

If you are up against the wall, as a HF, and either lose billions or make billions, you are juts going to keep doubling down. The wall street motto is ""Greed is good"" and THEY WILL NOT GO QUITELY INTO THE NIGHT.

**Important price 1: $250**If they can 'break' the positive momentum and get the price below $250 that may signal a bank run and collapse the price. They may try this at open on Monday.

**Important price 2: $300**They fought hard to not allow this important milestone to be reached on Friday. If it hits $300 it goes to $350.

**Important price 3: $340.20**This was their LAST ATTACK and many people will anticipate it again, which may mean a small push will re-create a self-fulfilling prophecy.

**Important price 4: $350**Hitting $350 signals HUGE confidence to the price and it will keep going to $400.

**Important price 5: $400**

At this point MOST buyers are in the money at a profit and you will start to see some profit taking. This may co-incide with a Short Attack to make it look like people are cashing in.

**Important price 6: $483 - THE ALL TIME HIGH**

As the all time high is approached many 'smart retards' will think to sell before other people start selling. Everyone is seeing that goal line and it may create more selling pressure as we reach that peak. There will also be less retail buying at these levels since who wants to buy at the peak. The only buyers will be the shorts covering which would just keep pushing the price up IF they get called and or are covering.

\*\*TLDR:\*\*There are at least 6 important price milestones at which shorts may attack next week and DUMP a lot of shares for sale in a short period of time. DO NOT PANIC... It's what they want. Be prepared for the psychological games they will play. Remember NO SANE INVESTOR dumps shares at a loss or less of a profit...

Have a GREAT weekend!

**TLDR UPDATE: FAWCK I FORGOT ABOUT $420.69! LOTS OF IDIOTS WILL SELL HERE TOO**

2021-03-13 20:48:35,wallstreetbets,"The DKNG Legislative Gamble For those in DKNG, there are potentially momentous events coming up in the next few months as state legislative sessions are coming to a close from now through about June. This could explain why there is a lot of unusual option activity around August at the 90c. 

The states in play and their progress on passing sports gambling either retail or mobile:

Texas: Two lawmakers filed legislation this week that would legalize casinos and sports betting in Texas. HJR133 was filed in the House on Tuesday and SJR49 filed in the Senate. The Texas Governor has also voiced support for the bill as well as the Sports Betting Alliance, which represents teams like the Dallas Mavericks, the Dallas Cowboys, and the Rangers. The Sports Betting Alliance has showed favoritism towards online sports betting too. This bill is supported between the two parties and the legislative session runs to the end of May. 

Florida: Legislative sessions are in progress and run to April 30th. The key part of negotiations is the Seminole Tribe of Florida. They offer a heavy endorsement as they run all casinos in the state of Florida. If they’re brought to the table in support of this bill soon, we could see some real pressure as the Governor is open to legalizing sports betting too. Though, as it stands, it doesn’t seem likely in this session. 

Arizona: Session ends on May 28th. Bill passed the House but faces political scrutiny in the Senate. Governor supports the legislation but its chance could end up grim if it gets stalled because of another bill trying to get horse racing on the ballot.

Maryland: Session ends in early-mid April (I think the 12th) Hogan is basically ready to sign this thing. It includes online sports betting too. This one practically a done deal.

South Dakota: March 29th marks the end of the session. The bill in this state easily cleared both the Senate and House. Governor is expected to sign off. 

Kansas: Session ends May 30th. The bill passed the Senate but its now in the House. Lawmakers in Kansas largely support the bill but there appears to be disagreements for who gets the gambling licenses. The Senate bill included 11 or 12 online gambling licenses, of which DKNG is included (of course).

DKNG could have a great year if some of these go through and could have an explosive one if they all do. The pandemic took a toll on these states and they need as much taxes as they can get. Sports betting is one way they can do that and it has bipartisan support across the aisle. Considering the DKNG already rose their estimates for the year, they could be thinking that their chances are looking good as well. As with all things political, buy the rumor and sell the news. Here’s to a maybe good year, my kings (and queens). Cheers 🍻"
2021-03-13 20:27:27,wallstreetbets,"The incredible story being forged in the battle for $GME This past week was incredible .... of course that’s on top of an already incredible story. 

DFV, Ryan Cohen, and many a smooth brained ape started this fight quite some time ago. Many doubted, but the momentum built and built until the huge spike at the end of January 2021. 

This first clash brought apes seeking opportunity, valuing GME, and of course those seeking to exploit the greedy HF’s who had overextended. As GME soared, new apes were drawn in. 

Then Melvin, citadel, RH, and other market manipulators did what they always do. Cheated. 

GME was soaring and apes were on their way to the moon. We all had our reasons for jumping in and why not?  Is it wrong to seek opportunity? Is retail not good enough to play the same game?

Apparently in the HF’s opinion we are all crayon eating bastards, it’s their game, and it only works if they make money. So they cheated, plummeted GME, and many apes were left floating in space. 

They didn’t care. They blamed retail. 

“Know what you’re investing in” 
“Meme stocks are volatile”
Distractions from where the real risk came from. Playing in a corrupt market with the facade of rules and structure. 

Sorry, but you can’t blame the apes who got left out there WHEN YOU CHANGED THE GAME! Trading halts that still allowed sells? What did you think would happen? If I’m an expert chess player and in the middle of the match the rules on how even a single piece can move are changed it puts me at risk! If I’m a retard, which i am, that just makes you even more pathetic that you can’t just play fair and beat me. 

There are many different apes in the GameStop game. Some of us have done years of research, DD, and like the stock. Others just came for tendies. 

Vlad called the initial swell a, “Black Swan Event”. Highly unlikely. 

Well Vlad, the Black Swan has returned. GameStop is again soaring. Over the past month it’s up 427%. And despite attempts to drive the price back down THE LINE HOLDS. 

This past week we saw some big moves. The battle intensified until Thursday and Friday where we fought to a standstill. Many apes were discouraged that the MOASS didn’t happen yesterday, myself included. Victory was within grasp. Pluto in our sights. But we are still in the trenches. 

But let’s not forget that GME is up 427% and holding! This is huge! We are making progress in a fight that was stacked heavily against us and we are holding!

Now stimmy’s are on the way. Hulu releases “Game Stopped” documentary this Monday. HF’s are bleeding money. 

This isn’t going to be easy and hasn’t been. But reinforcements are on the way. The HF’s are bleeding and all I have to do is HODL! I’m ready to got to Pluto and then some.  

I like the stock. I’m gonna build a house on it and stay here a while. Maybe forever. Doesn’t matter because that’s my smooth brained choice and the HF’s don’t get to tell me different. 

There’s a lot of dates being thrown around out there and maybe one of them is right. Doesn’t matter. I’ll be there when it happens cause I LIKE THE STOCK. 

NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. IM RETARDED AND BRAIN WASHED. 

TL;DR 

I LIKE THE STOCK. VLAD SAID GME WAS ONE TIME EVENT. HERE WE ARE 1 MONTH LATER STILL UP 427%.  DFV IS NOT A CAT. NEW APES & STIMMY’S INBOUND. I CAN STAY RETARDED LONGER THAN YOU CAN STAY SOLVENT!

2021-03-13 19:56:05,wallstreetbets,"I teach high school, which means I explain things to idiots every day. If you still don't understand call options, I got you. I see a lot of people asking basic questions about calls on just about every thread that mentions them. So here you go.

Note: before the finance majors come out and nitpick small things, remember that this is a basic primer for idiots; some of it has been simplified.

WHAT IS A CALL OPTION: BASICS

A call option (hereafter referred to simply as a ""call"") is a contract that gives you the ability, though not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of a stock for a specific price by a specific date, called the expiration date. Example: You buy a $400 call for GME that expires on March 19th. What that means is that at any time between now and end-of-day on 3/19, you can buy 100 shares of GME for $400. If the price spikes to $700 dollars, you can still buy them for $400. That's a pretty good deal.

So I need the price of GME to get to $400 to break even, and anything above that is profit, right? Not quite. You have to pay a premium for the option, which is the amount of money you're giving to the option seller in exchange for the contract. The premium is listed as the price per share, so if the option has a $2 premium, that means that you have to pay $2 per share of GME in the contract, which means that you pay $200 the buy the call ($2/share x 100 shares). You give the seller $200, and they give you the call option. Since you paid $200 for the option, this means that your break even price is $402 dollars per share. Why? Because if the price only got to $400, you could have bought it for $400/share without buying the contract, which means the money you spend on the contract was a waste. However, if the price goes to $403/share, then you make a profit, because you effectively paid $402/share for a stock worth $403/share.

But what if the price doesn't go up, or even goes down? Do I have to still buy those shares for $400? No. You never have to buy the shares if you don't want to. Remember, a call gives you the ability to buy shares for $400, but not the obligation.

But what if the price of GME goes way up but I don't have $40,000 around to buy 100 shares at $400/share? Then you sell the contract to someone who either does have $40,000 sitting around, or (slightly advanced info here that you don't need to know) to someone who is trying to offset a position. Regardless of who buys it, they will pay you a lot of money for your option because it is ITM, or in the money. What does that mean? Let's look at some option vocabulary.

CALL OPTION VOCABULARY

Strike Price: This is the price that you are allowed to pay for the stock per the contract. In our $400 call option above, the strike price is $400. At any time before the expiration date, you are allowed to exercise the contract the contract and pay $400/share for the stock.

Exercise: Exercising an option means you are exercising your ability to buy the 100 shares of stock. In the example above, you would spend $40,000 for 100 shares of stock regardless of the stock's price at the time. Can I exercise and only buy 20 shares of stock? No. If you can't afford to exercise, then you can sell your option to someone else.

Expiration Date: This is when your call expires. if you have a 3/19 expiration date, that means that your call option is no longer good after 3/19

Premium: The premium is the price you pay to the call-seller for the contract, and it is listed as the price per share. Knowing that, how much will it cost to buy an option with a premium of .25? If you do the math, it will cost you $25, which is .25/share x 100 shares.

ITM and OTM: ""In the Money,"" and ""Out of the Money."" ITM calls are calls for which the stock price has exceeded the strike price. If you have a $400 call, and the price of GME goes to $405, then your call is ITM because you can buy a $405 stock for $400. If you then immediately sold the stock for $405, you'd make money. OTM calls are calls for which the stock price is below the strike price. If you have a $400 call and the price of GME is $350, then your call is OTM. It is important to realize that being ITM doesn't mean being profitable. In the example above of the $400 call with a $2 premium, if GME goes to $401, you are ITM because 401>400, but you haven't broken even yet because your break-even price is $402.

FDs: FD is not an investment term, and you don't need to know what it means in order to understand calls. It is a WSB term, and it stands for maggot's delight (but with an F, because autmod won't let me define FDs). FDs are OTM calls with short expirations, and as such are a huge gamble. [The guy who spent 90k on 1dte \(1 ""day to expiration""\) OTM GME calls?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3r3v2/found_out_how_to_buy_call_options_yesterday/) Those were all FDs, and they all expired worthless. Why are they called FDs? Because when you buy FDs, you usually end up taking it in the ass.

WHEN PEOPLE LIST THEIR OPTION POSITIONS, THEY USE A BUNCH OF NUMBERS AND LETTERS THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. HOW DO I FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT

You have probably seen something like this: GME $400c 3/19. Let's break it down.

GME $400c 3/19 - The GME stands for Gamestop, which you probably figured out. The $400c is a call option with a strike price of $400. If it said $400p, it would be a put option, but we'll talk about those later. The 3/19 stands for the expiration date.

Now let's make it more complicated. If I said, ""I bought 10 $5 GME $800c 3/19,"" what do I mean?

It means that I bought ten contracts of GME $800 calls with a 3/19 expiration, and I paid $5 per share. If I paid $5 per share, how much did I spend on my contracts? I spent $5,000 ($5/share x 100 shares x 10 contracts).

Now you try it. A $700 call on GME that expires next week costs around seven bucks a share. How would you explain to me that you bought two of them?

You would say that you bought 2 $7 GME $700c 3/19. Now you can look like you know what you're talking about even though you still probably don't.

WHY DO PEOPLE BUY CALL OPTIONS?

This is confusing. Why do people even do this? People buy call options because you can make a lot of money. If you have the right to buy 100 shares of something for a fixed price, then for every $1 the share price goes above your break-even price, you make $100. If you have a $400c with a break even of $402, and the price gets to $412, then you make $1,000 profit. That's $10 of profit ($412-$402) times 100 shares. You can buy the shares and hold them, or you can buy them and sell them immediately to realize that profit. Or you can sell the contract to someone else and just take the money. It is usually better to sell the contract, but that's not an important distinction because most of you can't afford to exercise anyway, and will be selling contracts.

WHY ARE CALLS DANGEROUS?

When you buy a stock, at least you own the stock. If you buy an option and it expires worthless, then you have nothing. If the guy who bought 90k worth of FDs had bought 90k worth of GME and held, then he'd still have somewhere around 90k worth of GME, +/- 5% depending on when he bought on Thursday. Instead, he has nothing.

WHY DOES THE VALUE OF MY CALL KEEP CHANGING

So you bought a call option, and every time you look at it it's worth a different amount of money. That's because there are actually two types of value in an option: options have Intrinsic Value, and Extrinsic Value.

Intrinsic Value is the exercisable value of the option, If you own a $400c, and the price is $412, then the intrinsic value of the option is $12/share, or $1200, because that's the value you would get if you exercised it right now. as stock price goes up, intrinsic value goes up. Pretty easy.

Extrinsic Value has a more complicated definition, so we're going to call Extrinsic Value the potential the option has, and that potential is based on time and volatility. For example, if there is a long time before expiration, then that means that there is more potential for the option to go ITM, because more time = more chances for the price to rise. Therefore, options further from expiration will be worth more than options close to expiration. Conversely, less time to expiration = less value, which means that your option can constantly lose value as time goes on and the number of chances you have to go ITM decreases. This is called theta decay, but you don't need to worry about that.

Volatility is the second part of extrinsic value, and options for stocks that are more volatile can be worth more than options for stocks that trade steadily, because if a stock price swings wildly up and down, there's a greater chance that one of those upswings will put you ITM. This is reflected in a measurement called IV, or Implied Volatility. Like Theta Decay, IV is a more advanced concept that you don't need to understand now as long as you get the basics.

Due to the factors of time (theta) and volatility (IV) constantly changing, the extrinsic value of your option will also change over time. This is why the value of your option will constantly change. Is the stock calming down and starting to trade sideways (low volatility)? Your option value will decrease as IV drops. Is the stock starting to jump around? Your option value will increase as IV increases.

Sometimes the stock price can be climbing slowly but the value of your option can be decreasing. Why do you think that is? If the stock value is increasing slowly, but you're way OTM and running out of time because your option expires tomorrow, the downward price pressure of theta decay can overcome the upward price pressure of volatility and stock price rise, and your option value can decrease.

I BOUGHT A CALL AND I'M ITM! HOW/WHEN DO I SELL MY CONTRACTS

You can sell your contracts at any time. You don't have to wait until the expiration to sell your contracts. This is good, because if the price spikes, you can dump your options for profit and move on. There was a point yesterday when 90k FD guy's 275 and 285 calls were ITM when GME spiked to 290. If he had sold then, he wouldn't have lost everything by waiting until expiration.

I BOUGHT A CALL AND I'M ITM! HOW/WHEN DO I EXERCISE MY CONTRACTS

Make sure that you have enough money to cover buying all the shares and click the exercise button. They get your money, and you get their shares. This can take some time.

OK. I GET IT. BUT CAN YOU GIVE ME A TL:DR JUST IN CASE I ACTUALLY DON'T GET IT

A call option is a contract to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price. To buy the contract, you pay a premium to the contract seller. If the price of the stock goes above the price of your contract, you can either buy the shares or sell the contract for profit.

The End.

SO I'M AN EXPERT NOW AND CAN GO YOLO EVERYTHING ON CALLS AND MAKE MONEY?

No. You have a basic understanding of how calls work and know just enough to be dangerous. Don't go crazy. Buy a call. See how it works for real. Don't YOLO your life savings on your newfound knowledge. Or do. Live your life how you want; I'm not your dad. Just make sure you post the porn when you win or lose."

2021-03-13 19:25:05,wallstreetbets,"An Honest Question About the Much-Hyped 3/23 GME Earnings Report Please feel to correct me, as I still have a few wrinkles and my brain hasn't smoothed over completely (yet). Isn't this earnings report on 3/23 for the Q4 results? I see a lot of people convinced that this report is going to show a massive spike, driven by the swell of support from the ape and online community.

But, how much hype was there from consumers in the Oct-Dec range? Would we realistically reflect these gains on this next report, or will we not really see them until the Q1 report in three months?

&#x200B;

I Just don't want ~~people~~ apes to have unrealistic expectations and for their hands to turn to paper if the actual results do not meet the hype.

**Brokerages are starting to realize shorts are in BIG TROUBLE in $GME and $RKT.**

So far $RKT shorts have been in COMPLETE CONTROL of this stock and it's price since they IPOd at $18 in 2020.

In Feb 21 RKT BLASTED away earnings expectations and revenue with growth of 161%! Crazy amazing unexpected growth and profitability. The share price went from $19.90 to $21.85... LOL

Since then

On March 1st and 2nd the shorts got side-lined by a bunch of WSB interest and the price spiked +71% to $43.

RKT CEO says their share price at $43 is OK but they are still not being fairly valued to peers. (youtube links not allowed)

So what do the shorts do? They DOUBLE DOWN as they always do!

They unload millions of new shorts to attack the price:

On March 4th they have dropped the price to $26.80.

In the meantime paper-handed retail investors HAVE SOLD to this very obvious GME tactic once again and there are now more shorts available! These guys are so good at doubling down.

[Market Watch calls Short Interest at 40% on Feb 26th. Since the price went up and they just shorted millions more shares you can bet your sweet bananas short interest is probably higher.](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/rkt)

From a technical analysis POV the chart has 3 trailing support lines. In other words the price is very unlikely to dip below $23.50. Your downside is very minimal.

The morning of March 12th RKT was UP in pre-market. When the market opened there was huge volume and price drove down, killed the momentum and people thought they lost.

During that same time MILLIONS of shorts were fired:

Shares available went from 5.6M to 1.9M. Then retail SOLD.... You weak apes.

The OPEN INTEREST for MARCH 19th OUT THE MONEY IS INSANE.

Check out the strike of $30 with 48,889 contracts. On a float of only 100,000,000 (a little bigger than gme) that represents 4,888,900 shares just there (usually MMs will buy 50% or so as it approaches ITM).

In other words if this gets to $29 it will just keep going up until the highest strike - So above $65 likely.

**That's about a 300% return from current price.**

Also remember we have the DTCC new rule coming soon, we don't know the date yet but that's making the shorts piss their pants as they would have less liquidity to fight with. They really want to shake out all the retail money at the cheapest price THIS WEEK.

**TLDR:**

RKT is one of the most manipulated prices since IPO. Despite amazing performance, surprise earnings, dividends and buyback announcements the stock has been held under $24.

The stock is starting to be put on short-selling restricted lists which means shorts are over-risked and brokerages know this.

RKT has a relatively small float with high short interest. It won't take a lot to light the match. The options interest for next week also allows for a big gamma squeeze if the price hits $29 for a sustained period. We're at $25... It's not a lot to ask for.
